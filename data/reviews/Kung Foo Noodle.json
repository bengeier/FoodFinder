{"text":"This is an absolutely amazing restaurant. I come here all the time for lunch and get the various noodle bowls which are large bowls of soup. You can customize the soup however you want and as you try more things you get more ideas on how what you like. First timers should try something like Tom Yum, Hong Kong or Kung Foo bowls."}
{"text":"Love this place! Three little pigs is delicious as are the Chinese wings. Food and service are great every time we go."}
{"text":"This place has amazing Asian cuisine !!!! Great menu, awesome service, & most important Delicious food. The dishes are hot & fresh when delivered to your table. Do your self a favor & check it out. I have been there twice now & both times were great. I am definitely looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"We were disappointed when Tommy left Noodletasia due to the location on Gilead, but Kung Fu is a great new venture in Birkdale."}
{"text":"So happy we found this place. Great food, great service and great prices!  Their pad Thai was awesome!  Can't wait to go back and try more of their items."}
{"text":"I really like the Bao Bao options on their menu, I've never had anything like it. I had no idea Bao Bao was so delicious. The restaurant is clean, nice atmosphere, and the owner (Tommy) took the time to explain the nuances of his menu. Last but not least, as I write this review, they gave me a free drink for my to-go order!"}
{"text":"While other food are decent, Please don't waste your money on their Xiao Long Bao.As a native Chinese, I can say there are no aspects of their Xiao Long Bao comparable to traditional ones. The waiter even told us their Bao is handmade by someone from NY. Come on, it is even much worse than some frozen products that you can buy from Chinese markets at a much lower price. We may feel better if the Waiter didn't lie to us."}
{"text":"If you are looking for Asian food with a flair, when there is a little chill in the air  Come here!  Start off with the soup dumplings for a new experience of deliciousness. If you like a good pepper spice get the flaming szchechan soup noodles. Looking for a tasty delight soup, get the Lan Zhou on the mild side but equally amazing. I paid with the coconut chai tea.... Amazing dinner"}
{"text":"My boyfriend brought me here for a monthly anniversary lunch.  The host who greeted us was quick and nice.  He cleaned a large table off and we were seated right away.  The decor of the restaurant was striking with the black and red color scheme.    The prices here are very reasonable for what you get.  We had crab Rangoon, a side of vegetables, and the sesame chicken meal with rice & egg roll.  The sesame chicken was well cooked and the sauce was sweet.  The crab Rangoon was as good as I remembered, with ample crab and cream cheese stuffing.  I would certainly come here again."}
{"text":"Really neat spot.  Good fusion of foods.  Their soups are extremely good and complex.  I no longer have to drive to Charlotte for a good soup.  On par with Futo Buta."}
{"text":"Great addition to Birkdale and HVL. I loved the diverse menu and that we could get noodles for the kid, some sushi, and try a poke bowl. The poke was not that great (granted, we are pretty far away from fresh salmon and tuna!) but everything else was great!"}
{"text":"This place rocks. Very flavorful, creative dishes at reasonable prices. Cool vibe and excellent service. I'll be back often to work my way through the rest of the apps, stir fry, rice and soup bowls."}
{"text":"Great change of pace for asian fare. Soup Noodle bowls were excelent and offered some original flavors. Chinese style entrees were pretty common fare but not bad  Quaint small place with fast polite service"}
{"text":"Im a regular at anything Tommy comes out with! Made the drive from ballantyne just for the service!"}
{"text":"A friend and I came here for lunch recently. We prefer an early lunch time and so we got first pick of a table. Nice decor and atmosphere, but what really shines here is the food. I ordered the scallion chicken and my friend ordered orange chicken. Both were delicious. Their recipe for scallion chicken is the best I have had--a little kick but not too spicy and the sauce was light rather than syrupy. Crispy egg roll and fried came with the order and the serving size was perfect. My friend chose steamed rice and vegetarian roll which also looked good. Service was terrific. The owner/manager visited our table. We felt cared for but not bothered by wait staff as we were offered refills on drinks and rice. I will be a frequent visitor to Kung Foo and I will definitely bring others with me."}
{"text":"Awesome food with awesome staff.  The Singapore is my favorite but everything tried is just great.  Best lunch in area for sure."}
{"text":"Waitress was great. Food was below average. No atmosphere. Sushi roll took a 1/2 hour to make. Very weird layout. Owners looked board and tired. Just a weird vibe all around."}
{"text":"Omg this place is AMAZING!!!!!  Seriously wonderful food!  We had the Hong Kong noodles, sushi, moo moo noodles, pork buns, and wings.  Everything was absolutely delicious!  Very reasonably priced too!  Can't wait to try more menu items!"}
{"text":"Since my previous review, this has become my favorite restaurant in the Charlotte area. I get it at least twice a week and every time I get it makes me want to go back even sooner. Can't wait for them to finish remodeling so I can go back!"}
{"text":"Just happened to be in town over the weekend and stopped here for dinner based on reviews.  Great place and great food.  Staff was very attentive and quick. Will probably stop here again next time we are in town."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed every single meal I've had at this place.  I especially like the Pad Thai and the BBQ wings.  Great staff, very friendly.  Look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"First time here and the food was great.  Definitely making another trip to eat here again."}
{"text":"Went there on Friday night and had a great meal.  The food was really good.  We started with the XIAO LONG BAO and they were really tasty.  Both of the soup noodle dishes we ordered for dinner were very tasty.  I will be back, soon."}
{"text":"Fun lunch spot. We really enjoyed the Hong Kong noodles. I could drink that delicious broth everyday! Also ordered the shanghai soup dumplings which were also delicious but I wish the breading wasn't so thick. Still a great place for Asian noodles here in Charlotte area"}
{"text":"The food is everything you want, deep flavors, big portions , great ingredients, better price. Tommy makes the place feel like home and remembers his customers. The service is always amazing especially Miyu with her bubbley nature. My favorite meal is the hot pot, very spicy but in a satisfying way. I always get ginger tea which is plenty to share between 2. I'm so glad birkdale has an Asian cultured restaurant like Kung fo, we've needed you guys!"}
{"text":"Never in my life did I think that I would base my day off some food. Shortly after eating some noodles and sauce I felt moist sweat dripping from my forehead. As I started to get hot my intestines rumbled feircly. I could feel the fire and molten craps pulsing through my anus. At this point I was sitting in 5:00 mass on a Wednesday.  My girlfriend asked me what was wrong but I was trying to clamp my cheeks together so hard I couldn't respond. With a purple face and a flaming ass I could feel the diarrhea running down.she thought I had farted in church and slapped me in the stomach. The niagra falls of feces shot out of my anus like a 50 caliber sniper in the middle of church. The embarrassment was unbearable as well as the stench. The nice old widow sitting in front of me started seizing at the sight of my accident. I began to get dizzy as the terrible pain in my hair and crap covered escape hatch began to be to much. I woke up and hour later in the priests bedroom with a worse pain in my but than before but at least I wasn't shooting crap out my anus. The priest had a weird smile on his face for him helping a man who ruined his church forever but in a way he blessed me with something while I was asleep and cleaned my hole but the moral of the story is don't eat here and go to church after"}
{"text":"This restaurant is so good. Service, atmosphere, taste is all in this place.  Finally a great, authentic Chinese restaurant in Lake Norman area.  It is a close to being back in NYC as it gets"}
{"text":"Had the Chung fun and kimchee noodles. Both dishes were loaded with flavor and had the side of pineapple wings, which were also delicious!"}
{"text":"My newly found favorite in birkdale! This is my second time here in two weeks, I tried Lan Zhou noodles and pork belly bun. As a Chinese who have lived in New York for years,  I was always a bit disappointed at the Asian food here, Kung Foo noodles defiantly exceeds my expectations in NC. All the noodle dish I had so far are great, I would recommend Tonkatsu, it reminds me of New York style Japanese noodle house, very delicious."}
{"text":"Can't really go wrong with chinese food! A little language trouble but good people, good service and the food was pretty darn delicious!"}
{"text":"This restaurant nice lunch ambiance, diverse menu options and the chef will tailor entrees to your needs. I had Saholin noodles which were a perfect blend of noodles, vegetables and broth. I could not stop eating this even after I was full. I also had mango bubble tea which was delicious. It was perfect blend of sweetness."}
{"text":"The new menu is disappointing. My wife and I have been coming regularly for over a year: the food is always fantastic, and the owners are great. However, they recently changed their menu, getting rid of the #1 reason we come here: soup dumplings! Our server said they were so popular that the kitchen couldn't keep up with the orders...so they replaced their distinctive soup dumplings with regular gyoza (nothing special). Every time we came here, most tables ordered the soup dumplings, so I'm baffled by this. They also changed their sushi menu and got rid of our favorite rolls--the new speciality rolls are underwhelming. Old menu was 5 stars. We will be back when they bring back soup dumplings!"}
{"text":"Best Asian food in Huntersville area. Their food isn't the typical menu you find at Asian restaurants. They pack in so much flavor into their dishes, especially their noodle soup bowls. Sushi menu is below average in my opinion but that's not why I go here. Their wings are also excellent. Don't be afraid to go here just for their typical Chinese entrees, which are excellent. Service is wonderful but I wish they had a larger space. I always have to wait and there is no dedicated waiting space so you must linger in the doorway or explore Birkdale."}
{"text":"This was a pleasant surprise. We were actually waiting to go to another restaurant in the area (an hour wait), but decided to try this instead. Reasonable prices and food was fantastic (we mainly had sushi). It's worth a visit!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Very authentic and original taste. I had the Hong Kong noodle and my fiancé got the curry kick. Delicious options with a great depth of flavors. I look forward to trying more dishes here in the near future. As in, I had lunch and want to go back for dinner."}
{"text":"These guys are exactly what birkdale has needed. Very simple and authentic. Everything we have tried has been to die for and is made that much better by the reasonable price. The service is great too, the girls are very friendly as if your family when you come inside. The sushi is art and its mesmerizing to watch it being made right at the bar. Very clean and comfortable environment. Try the soup dumplings, I request the dumpling sauce with mine instead of the sauce it comes with because I'm not a heavy vinegar lover. (Perfect date night is Kung foo on a Tuesday before a movie then finished by some Starbucks)"}
{"text":"Great food, good service and fair prices. I went there with my family for dinner, we all loved the food. Kids had sushi, my wife and I had noodle bowls. I would definitely go back the next time we are in the area. It was a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Heard about this newly openned Chinese place in Birkdale shopping area. Since good Chinese is hard to find in the Lake Norman area, wife and I gave it a shot. Punch line....there is now good Chinese in the LKN area :) Wife had sesame chicken and I had the kimche noodle soup. Both were made fresh and served hot right out of the kitchen..no heat lamps here! We'll be back to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"We drove 36 min from south Charlotte to try the Xiao long Bao and their noodles. The skins were to thick and it ruined the experience of eating the Xiao long Bao. I ordered the ramen and my wife ordered the Budae Jjigae and both of us were disappointed. The quality of the noodles are the same that we can get from the grocery store. My ramen came with the egg cracked on the soup instead of seasoned hard boiled egg. The broth is below average. Maybe we should stick with the Chinese noodle dish.  Definitely not worth the drive."}
{"text":"Amazing place, great service, very yummy food. I got the surprise me roll and it was really good, was very pleasantly surprised. I asked for soy paper and they said it won't be an issue at all. Wife had the chicken and shrimp noodles and it was really good. Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"The noodles soup was great. I had the beef noodles soup and the soup is definitely authentic with the right seasoning/herb. It's one of the best noodles soup I had here in Charlotte. Unfortunately the Xiao long Bao (soup dumplings) was a real disappointment. The reviews were good here so we thought we'd give it a try. They were far from the ones we tasted elsewhere and not comparable to the original ones from Ding Tai Fung. The pastery is too thick all around especially at the swirly top where the dumplings opening is closed. As a result, they were not completely cooked through and were doughy. The pastry had this slight yellow undertone that is typically a result of reheating steamed dumplings which was also another disappointment.  The price is slightly on the expensive side, but probably because of its location. I would go there again for the noodles, but definitely not the dumplings."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! I try and come here as much as possible, i always get a soup and either the krusty krab roll or a spicy crab and its always so good!! 10/10 recommend"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Asian cuisine spot in Huntersville! Their wings are fantastic -- especially with the Chinese BBQ sauce on them. My absolute favorite dish is the Singapore noodles! If you like curry, you'll most likely love those noodles. I've gotten other things but it's never really as good as the Singapore, so I hate to deviate now because I know what is the best :)  Service is always usually on point and everyone is very friendly! We recommend this place to all of our friends."}
{"text":"After reading some of the reviews, my husband and I decided to try out kung fu noodle. First off, it is located in the back corner area of Birkdale shopping Center, easy to miss from the main shopping area of Birkdale. We walked in and were greeted with a warm smile from the female hostess, and sat immediately, there is no wait. It was moderately busy, as it was a regular Tuesday night. I ordered the sesame chicken with brown rice, and my husband ordered the Mongolian beef. Hands-down delicious! The service was superb and were able to even meet the infamous owner, Tommy! We have ordered out several times cents, trying orange chicken, basil chili beef, and eggrolls. Absolutely this place does not disappoint! We would definitely recommend!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here last night based on recommendation from a friend. We loved it!  We started with the Xiao Long Bao which was very tasty. I got Lan Zhou with beef. It was packed with flavor but be warned it is very spicy. I was sweating. My wife got Hong Kong (not spicy) which was very flavorful.  She loved it. We liked food so much we got a couple of To Go orders to try some other items.  Highly recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for a year now and it has never disappointed! The staff, especially Chelsea and Miyu, are super sweet and I feel like they are my best friends whenever I walk in. The owners, Tommy and his wife, are always hands on with the business and always in the building! A smooth operation with amazing food - my favorite place to eat. I recommend Kung Foo Noodle to everyone! My friends and I drive 30 minutes just to go at least 5 times a month!"}
{"text":"Great spot in Birkdale! I've been here several times and have been all over the menu without ever having something bad! All the sushi rolls are creative and delicious. The noodle dishes are amazing.. definitely recommend the curry kick noodles (the coconut curry broth is delicious). The decor is creative and they've been adding beautiful murals! Staff and service is excellent and attentive. I've also seen the kitchen is very accommodating to children, making this a great place for a family night out!"}
{"text":"Yes it's in birkdale. Ugh. Don't let that stop you from coming up here! Omg everything is so good. Pork belly boa boa and the kung boa, and get dumplings!! Holy smack your momma good!  A few more sips of sake and a full plate of scallion chicken for the win. Get the chili sauce.  Didn't get the sushi but sure will next time."}
{"text":"Great place to eat! Me and my fiancé go often and the owner is always very kind and welcoming. Their recent renovation looks nice as well."}
{"text":"Great food and awesome service.  We patron this establishment often and it is always excellent."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I have been to my share of sushi restaurants and only can remember a handful of rolls that have stood out. I am still thinking of the Lemon drop roll that I have had almost one month ago. That roll is definitely on my list of all time favorites---what a unique combo and oh my was it yummmmyyyy. I have been wanting to go back every.single.day.since. Will make it back asap. AMAZING!!!! Oh and EVERY thing else we had...the Poke..oh my...Ill have dreams about these two items tonight...."}
{"text":"Xiao Long Bao in Charlotte area! Definately not on the same level as Shanghia, but the fact that you can find them here is a plus.  Sushi is ok, slightly Americanized with lots of sauce and smaller cuts of fish.  The noodle soup is great. Nice to be able to find spicy beef soup!  Fried rice was slightly too greasy."}
{"text":"Chinese BBQ chicken wings!!!  Owner is super nice also.  This is the little place you've been looking for"}
{"text":"Just visited this place for lunch and it was amazing!  I got there around 11:40 on a Wednesday and there was no one else in the place.  A little off-putting, but it was worth it.  The server was wonderful and spent a few minutes walking me through the menu, in-depth.  She was extremely knowledgeable about the menu items and had recommendations for each type of dish.  I am not kidding you when I say that my order took 4 minutes to arrive.  I realize this is directly related to the fact that no one else was there, but that is still blazing fast service.  The dish itself was delicious and spicy - I ordered the Basil Chili Chicken with Fried Rice.  The price was reasonable at $7.75 and the portion was very fair for lunch.  I will definitely be back, sooner rather than later."}
{"text":"This our new go to spot for amazingly flavorful soups and classic soup dumplings.  The Tonkotsu pork bone broth and the charsu bun are awesome!  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic. Food was amazing. Tommy was super great and very friendly and helped me with choosing what to have since it was my first time. You will not be disappointed. Looking to go back really soon."}
{"text":"This is definelty my go to place for quality asian noodles and sushi! The food is delicious and the service is top notch ! The waiters are friendly and very attentive to the enjoyment and satisfaction of the customer. I have eaten here several times alone, with coworkers, and family members and this restaurant is consitent with the food and service as previously stated.   The decoration of the place is definelty a sight to see with its hand painted walls and cool gaming posters. I believe new comers and regular customers would agree that Tommy the owner of the place manages and cooks with all of his heart. He is a down to earth person with an endless passion of seeing his customers enjoy the food and have a good time. I highly recommend this place if you are looking for great asian food with excellent service! I travel a lot to China and when I need my authentic Chinese flavor fix this is where I go."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Kind of sad that they don't do the soup dumping anymore but everything was great! The owner, I guessing he was the owner, was so kind and so friendly. Service was great! I got the Bang Bang with chow fung noodle! Love the chicken wings!! Can't wait to go back!!! Wish they were closer to the university area but it worth the trip! I highly recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"Curry kick with half the noodles and add spice. WOW!!!!!!! Sushi is great as well. Cold sake tea also not on menu but great.  Tommy the owner is amazing. Wonderful service and the food is always good. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Awesome dinner! Tommy the owner is a first class host making sure every customer is taken care of. Mongolian beef is excellent and I think we will be trying the dumplings and the poke on our next visit."}
{"text":"I moved to Charlotte about 45 days ago and my guess is I have eaten here at least 20 times. I was looking for a local noodle house and this has  become my second home. Everything I have had on the menu has been delicious and tasty. You can taste the love and passion in every bite. My go-to bowl of noodles is the Lan Zhou.  There is something very unique about the broth that I have been unable to put my finger on. You can tell it took some time and work to achieve the savory beef flavor. I've had my fair share of authetntic asian cuisines but I've never tasted the flavors in this bowl. I like to get it with extra beef and bok choy. They allow you to mix and match noodles and ingredients from other bowls as well so you can change it up.   If you decide to get Hot Pot, it is indeed very HOT.  I think its full of chopped Thai bird chillies. Bring a towel, you may sweat. My favorite appetizers are the Garlic Chili Wings and the Spicy Wontons.  Aside from the very reasonable prices and phenomenal flavors, the one thing that kept me coming back was the customer service. The place is small enough that they are able to pay close attention to every customer and table. I never have to ask for a refill here, my cup is always full.  You're consistently checked on to make sure your meal is to your liking.  They have me hooked and I keep coming back. I think you will too. Nothing but good vibes!"}
{"text":"This is one of my new favorites in Birkdale. At 6:30 on a Thursday evening we were seated right away (although I know this will change soon once people start to find out about this little gem). Service was great. Beer and wine selection was eclectic and interesting (although a few more sake choices would have been nice). We got the dumplings (awesome), Thai basil wings (amazing sauce and came out piping hot), chicken hibachi (the freshest and least greasy hibachi I've ever had -- all other hibachi will disappoint me after eating this), and the curry kick noodle bowl (noodles perfectly cooked, very slight spice heat, delicious broth, tender chicken chunks, I could go on and on about how good this was). The portions were large but not ridiculous. I've already recommended to friends I have in the area and plan to go back soon!! Next time, I want the Tom Yum"}
{"text":"I love that they have a nice variety of veggie/tofu options which are all delicious. I even heard that they're willing to prepare some things vegan which makes me even more excited about this place."}
{"text":"Not all that great. Stopped by for the first time after finding good reviews in yelp. The staff is very friendly. Uncomfortable seating. Sushi was good but very poor preparation with Singapore noodles. No real flavor. Taste was bland. Not coming back!"}
{"text":"An absolute addiction! My fiancé and I eat here far too often. The Tonkotsu is delicious, and a must-have if you decide to visit. Tommy has created a beautiful atmosphere and the food is consistently superb. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service!! We had Chelsea as our server and she was super helpful with vegan options. Delicious food that is inexpensive right in Birkdale Village!We will be back-thank you Chelsea!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome... the food always taste great and the service is always on point. I come here fairly often. Tommy the owner is always a wonderful host!!"}
{"text":"This was a very nice little Asian noodle place, tucked in the back of the shopping area. Nicely lit and with a quiet and calm ambiance. Prices were fairly cheap for this area.   My Tonkotsu ramen and pork dumplings arrived quickly. Pork dumplings were nothing spectacular, the ramen was visually gorgeous though, and tasted rich and salty and hearty like a Tonkotsu ramen should. Pork belly was not as thick as previous photos would suggest, but was enough for my liking.  I would have purchased soup dumplings, but it seems they have removed all dumplings except the pork or veggie dumplings from the menu. I overheard a server explain to another customer that no one liked them, so they removed them. They seemed to have good reviews though, and I would have liked to try them.   I would suggest to the restaurant that they add them back, perhaps at a higher price to offset the low demand, as the ingredients to make them are not terribly unique and customers such as myself and the other party present when I was there would definitely still order them."}
{"text":"Place was clean and staff was helpful and attentive. The chicken wings and dumplings were excellent and the ramen was delicious."}
{"text":"Their wings are incredible!!!! Service was pretty slow, but we also had a large group so I'm willing to over look that part, but they were generally pretty friendly and receptive. I personally had sushi, and it was solid, but the wings were really what I should've gotten. They were crispy and well seasoned and the flavor popped with every bite. Many people in my group also had their dumplings and said they were pretty good, but the wings were delicious! They had multiple flavors which were all tasty, and they brought them out fresh and hot and delicious, and the wings were a pretty good size too. A couple of people also got the Lucky Buddha beer, and it was a nice lite beer in a cool bottle, but the wings really stole the show. Don't let the name of this restaurant fool you, this is and should be a wing joint."}
{"text":"Great sushi, great curry, and amazing prices. I wish half the places I ate took this much pride in their food. If you are not eating here your wasting your money."}
{"text":"My brother and SIL brought me here after raving about it. I tried the ramen with chicken and it was glorious! Lots of meat and bok choy, and just the best broth! My brother had the kung foo soup which was also great! I may be making a lot of visits to my brother in the future. Mmmm, broth..."}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic Asian flavors, look no further. I am so happy to have stumbled upon this hidden gem. The atmosphere is clean and laid back. The service is fabulous. The Xiao Long Bao dumplings are delicious and the Tom Yum soup won't disappoint. If you are a spicy food lover, you will be pleasantly surprised that they, unlike other places, aren't afraid to turn up the heat. The owner is always present and extremely nice and helpful. This place is a breath of fresh air."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Asian place in Huntersville. Tommy, the owner, was the mastermind behind Noodletasia back in its heyday. The wait can be a little long on weekends, but that's just indicative of how good the food is. Friendly service, quality food, solid drink selection -- a definite must-try."}
{"text":"We were in the mood for something simple like fried rice. We ordered one chicken fried rice and one plain. We felt the chicken was lacking some flavor, but the rice and seasoning picked up the slack. The plain was fantastic. Both were cooked great and a good amount of fried egg. Often times, you don't get enough egg...both had plenty. We'll be back to try some other items for sure...but we'll get the fried rices again."}
{"text":"Our favorite family quick dinner spot! We love eating here on our busy Friday nights after work and school. They are fast! They are yummy! Just a good spot for a quick, well prepared, affordable meal."}
{"text":"Soooo good! It was my first time and the stars are right! I had the pineapple wings and the bacon fried rice! Sooo good... only one little problem, the chili oil wasn't spicy... but it didn't make or break my opinion of the place so I still have it 5 stars! Will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Im a gourmand. a foodie. In all of the Lake Norman Area....i have to say that this is my favorite place so far. A gem of a hideaway on a cold, rainy day...i didn't try the sushi but i have had about four of the soups. Every one is made with love and care.The flavors are refreshingly new to me and rich with flavor & variety. I like the first one....i think it was called LanDaou, The szechuan ma la (with 5 spice was soothingly good), the Budae Jigae was Epically rich with flavors...and the Tom yum was also rich but lacking in that potent lemongrass flavor i crave in that dish. i didn't take any pics but the Pad Siew was the best I've ever had....and I'm from Honolulu, where there are a plethora of asian restaurants! Also....the Hot mustard for the egg rolls was the best I've ever eaten...Super Pungent and perfect. The summer roll was good too but could use alot more herbs for me. The Black and red atmosphere is very \"townie\" with hard wood seating but i think they have done well considering the space. i like the minimalistic clean look of the sushi bar. My waiter was very attentive and helpful even tho it was busy.      Overall, they have acquired a new regular customer.      I came back and had the pad Thai but had to return it because it was too sweet for me and mostly noodles with no vegetables.      here is an update: since my previous review, Kung foo noodle changed Chef. The new chef is not as skilled in the kitchen. I ordered the kimchi fried rice which comes with an egg on top. The chef could not seem to make the egg over medium without burning it. Really? I was told that the egg had to be cooked in the wok in oil? Signed on the outside white but raw on the inside. Sorry but I don't like totally raw eggs. Get an egg pan? I was made to feel as if something was wrong with me for sending the egg back. Oh well don't need to be treated with no respect when I've supported this place.  If the manager has a bad chef, that is not my fault."}
{"text":"It was my first time visiting and I really enjoyed the food. We sat outside and it was great weather. I never felt we went unattended even sitting outside. We ordered pork belly and lamb bao buns, tonkotsu ramen, mongolian beef, and the wonton dumplings. We also had some hot sake. Everything was great, i didnt care for the soy sauce and ginger sauce they placed out for dipping...but other than that I enjoyed it all."}
{"text":"I am so glad I found this place. The prices are affordable and the food is delicious! I mainly wanted to come here for the Xiao Long Bao. We ordered both the Pork and the Crab ones. I personally prefer the crab ones just because it was not as dry as the pork ones. The actual dumpling was I guess pasty in a way where when you bite into it, it's not a gooey bite like it should be. The dumpling should be consistent with the filling, meaning the dumpling was dry. The ginger sauce that goes with the soup dumplings had too much vinegar so I didn't use it. The soup inside the dumplings was insanely good though! I also ordered the Curry Kick and I was not disappointed. This place is killin it with their broth. My noodles were not soggy and was the perfect texture. I want to try everything on this menu! It's crazy how many different items they have from rice, to wings, to sushi. I am also obsessed with the decor. It's very modern with a touch of the \"Kung Fu\" idea."}
{"text":"My wife and I spend a couple of months in Birkdale and the rest of our time in Long Island.  Kung Foo Noodle is easily the best Chinese restaurant that we have been to and is 1/4th the price of NYC Chinese restaurants.  Tommy, the owner, is exceptional as well.  Their black bean sauce, Tom Yum soup, pan fried or steamed dumplings and Si Fu fried rice are our favorites."}
{"text":"So this is my second time in. First time was a wonderful experience and this time is no different.  Was promptly seated, beer was brought within a minute of sitting down, and food within five. Ordered the Curry Kick, spicy as they'll make it, and it does not disappoint! I'm the person that will order Thai Hot at Thai places, Indian Hot at Indian places, and this dish is keeping me in check.  The owner is the nicest guy. Last time I was in he took the time to fully explain the menu -- I had never heard of soup dumplings, for instance -- and even let my date get another dish, free of charge, when it turned out to be too spicy for her. I really wish the best for this place. It's a little empty now, but maybe that's because it's lunch on a Monday.  This place is great though. I recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"The service was fantastic! We loved James!  We ordered 3 different types of Soup Noodles: Tonkatsu, 3 Little Pigs and Curry Noodles. We personally loved the Tonkatsu and Curry noodles. The 3 Little Pigs was a little bit saltier than the other two. We also orders the Soup Dumplings here. We had both Pork and Crab. The Crab was our favorite because it had more flavor! Some of them ripped and didn't have soup so be careful when pulling them out. The Curry, Wasabi, Thai Basil Wings were great too! Don't forget the Coconut Tea too!!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING on all fronts--food, service, and atmosphere. Tommy, the owner, treats you like family and is always there to ensure you are having a good experience.   My absolute favorite thing to get is the budae jjigae (soup noodles). The flavors are out of this world and the price is extremely reasonable.   This is definitely one of the best Asian restaurants in the area, and would recommend to anyone looking for a clean, friendly, and delicious restaurant."}
{"text":"It's like eating in New York, but without the NY prices. Soup dumplings! Ask for extra broth with them."}
{"text":"I really like this little place. I have had a few soups (full sized meal) and also a few entrees. I would order any of them again and be pleased. I actually typically order an entree and get a soup to go to take to work for lunch the next day :)."}
{"text":"Amazing!! We got the strawberry bubble tea, spicy wontons, chicken bahn mi, curry kick, pad tai and lo mein. The portions were on the smaller side but that's really our only complaint and even with that it's delicious so that's why we still gave it 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere, friendly service and great tasting fresh Asian food!  We will be adding this to our list of favorite places in the LKN area!"}
{"text":"My husband and. I have been in town 6 days visiting out daughter from DC and she discovered this gem!  We have already been twice and plan on taking my friend from Carey there on Friday!  It is very difficult to find great soup dumplings, but these are excellent.  They are the best we have had since New York.  For those who don't know soup dumplings, they take longer to make, but worth the wait!  We've had two orders both times.  The dumplings have a broth in them which you sort of sip out.  Hard to explain, but simply fabulous!  In addition, the orange chicken was delicious as was the Thai basil beef.  The curry kick soup was very tasty - and spicy!  The owner, Tommy, came out to see us both times and ask if there was anything we needed regarding explanation.  Turns out he's from NY and we know the same soup dumplings restaurants.  It is nice that it is tucked around the corner, the ambiance is nice, and it isn't too noisy which is great if you want to actually have a conversation.  The egg rolls which come with the lunch specials were also spectacular.  I was really surprised to find such a good Asian restaurant in the Charlotte area!  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great mix of different Asian cuisine. Really enjoyed everything we had. Loved trying a few different things. Prices very reasonable. Will be back."}
{"text":"Update 7/17/2017: Tommy has reopened today after several weeks of remodeling. The place is just as great as it ever was and the menu has been updated as well! Check it out! I had the Hot Pot, which as you might already guess, had significant heat and leads of flavor. Glass noodles, beef, shrimp, fish balls, and a molten broth.   New things on the menu include tacos, kimchi fried rice, and BANH MI. Two new soups as well: the aforementioned Hot Pot and a new \"Bang Bang\" pork, radish, and bok choy soup. I know there is more that I am missing.   Cant wait to try all of that stuff as well as get back on the horse with my old favorites!"}
{"text":"Excellent hot noodles.  The Lao Zhou had a rich and savory broth with just the right amount of spice.  I'm so happy I stopped in."}
{"text":"Had friendly service from everyone including the owner during a steady dinner hour. We got the Lotus Root Tofu and Hibachi Chicken. The Lotus Root was tasty, but the Hibachi Chicken was incredibly sweet and had entirely too much sauce poured over the rice...not a fan. I will probably give it another try, but not anytime too soon."}
{"text":"Good food, lots of options and reasonable prices.  The owner and waitstaff were very attentive.  I plan to return!"}
{"text":"So this was our first time getting to go food here and they are new so we def love that a new place has opened here. Mongolian beef was so tender and tasty, General tso chicken was great too! The best part was the price for the portions, you get exactly the quantity of food and Good food that you expect from a Chinese go to! My only critique would be that the Pad Thai was too dry and needed much more sauce, I also ordered shrimp but got pieces of tofu in the dish as well(tofu isn't my favorite :/). But! The people were so nice and as they get into their groove I know this place has great potential!"}
{"text":"Kung foo noodle is definitely a hidden gem in the Birkdale Village shopping center.  Surprisingly, on a Saturday night, we were set right away at about 8 PM. They do not take reservations here except for large parties. It is a small restaurant, so it's probably better to come earlier or later the typical dining time on a weekend.  What I really came here for was the soup dumplings! I have them when we lived in California and was addicted right away. They take a little longer to make so we waited for those while we ate some other goodies from the menu.  The Ramen soup was delicious! The broth was so packed with flavor in the noodles were perfectly tender, as were the meats in the soup.  The chicken scallion was equally as good, sweet and savory and perfectly cooked. We went with our server suggestion and ordered it with a little main noodles instead of rice. Yum!  Now for the only reason I'm giving it a four instead of five are the soup dumplings. When I cracked one open to get to the good stuff, there was maybe one drop of broth in there? Now the dumplings were delicious and all, but where was the soup?? That was disappointing for sure. I will be going back there another day soon, but not for the soup dumplings."}
{"text":"We happened on this corner, off Main Street, Birkdale Village spot and were completely taken by the service and unique flavors of this joint. Tonight was an usually warm January evening so we brought the dog with us for a patio dining night out - but everywhere was packed, so we were about to go home, turned on the corner and noticed their patio was empty. They seated us immediately - with our dog - on the patio (on the back side, low foot traffic) - I wish I knew the host's name for a shout-out. Our server Gage (sp?) was very attentive, even making beer suggestions as they were out of an original request. Game-changer: the Xiao Long Bao - dumpling with pork and soup inside. Delicious. Poke, slurp, enjoy. The Char Siu Korean pork BBQ slider was... not a slider I ever knew, so good!! Partner got eel roll sushi that he liked, I got my usual spicy tuna roll that was *delicious* - the drizzle sauce was awesome! Gage complimented our dinner with... DEEP FRIED OREOS! Definitely coming back!! Thanks Kung Foo - just wish we had some pics to share with our rave review!!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and I've tried all sorts of different things I can't even pronounce. Never been disappointed! We tried some kind of basil beef today with an egg roll and fried rice and it was AMAZING! We were gonna order the Mongolian beef but the waitress suggested trying this cuz it has veggies in it too and we did...and we loved it!! We also had the pork dumplings which were awesome, and some kind of Chinese BBQ pork bun. Delish!! If you like this sort of thing, or even noodle bowls, this place is amazing!! Their wings are awesome too!! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Ok so flavor is relative, right? Having lived in Korea...having grown up in NYC with a lot of those years in Chinatown and Ktown...having spent most my favorite meals before the setting of an aromatic Asian dish...this place is amazing.   Ok so...  Soup bombs! Honestly soup dumplings are rare and when done they are rarely done well stateside. The ones here are awesome. They don't dry out, they've got that umami in the broth you're looking for and the prices are great.   The soups kill - my recommendation is the Hong Kong, Tom Yum or the one with the milky bone broth that starts with a T.   And the steamed buns are light, airy and sweet with well done proteins.   I've never had the sushi and it may be amazing but I come here for noodles and soup bombs. And so should you.   And as for the owner, Tommy? I made an aside about never having Peking duck in Charlotte...he overheard...offered a fresh Peking duck in whole reasonably priced. It's not on the menu and all you need to 48 hrs notice so it's done perfectly. Go here. Thank me. Thank Tommy. Enjoy."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in Birkdale Village! It's out of the way from busy passer by's. Tucked in the back in the middle Kung Foo is a hidden oriental jewel with a lot of flavor and character. This place is so delicious that the chef will make items that is not on the menu if you let him know in advance.  My favorites are the Crab Rangoon's the Thai basil wings and any of the soup noodles, but be careful not only are the soup noodles delicious they are very temperature hot, guaranteed to give you a nice steaming facial. I have to admit I haven't tried all the items like the sushi, (my daughter always orders) because I keep ordering my favorites. If you want a great authentic Asian food experience this is the place"}
{"text":"I love the taro bubble tea. I love the Curry Kick, and Lan Zhou soup noodle. The shrimp sauce goes good with anything especially the sushi and fried rice. I think it's pretty cool how you can have a nice hot bowl of noodles along with sushi that's very appetizing. Especially with the 1000 Likes, and Beauty and the Beast Roll. Thanks Tommy! :D"}
{"text":"I expected more and got the same but overpriced this time from this operator.  Quality food, but didn't like the atmosphere.   Worth a visit though, you may give it a 4 star...which isn't bad."}
{"text":"2nd visit. Got the \"surprise me\" sushi roll based on reviews...OMG. They know what they're doing. No one told us what was in it once it arrived,  but that's okay because we like everything and it was fantastic. It was fried shrimp and roe and other things I'm not sure of. The curry kick soup was awesome but the chicken in it was nothing special. I wonder if they'd let me sub that out next time (or leave it out completely. doesn't need it!). Fantastic service as usual. Love kung foo."}
{"text":"I went here on a night of Thursday night football, and obviously it wasn't going to be packed, but I had a wonderful date with my boyfriend. I ordered the Kung foo noodle and I was going to get the Bang Bang for the spice, but my boyfriend got that one. Mine was awesome! Everything was hot and cooked thoroughly. The spice that I tasted from the Bang Bang was intense so beware of the \"beginner\" spice level, especially if you're prone to being wimpy like me. Great date place and the art is very cool."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in Birkdale Village! The food is always good, and the owner is always on premises. I love the sesame chicken dish, and the pad see ew.  Good prices, too! Staff is always friendly & Ive never had to wait for a table. Definitely recommend this spot for lunch!"}
{"text":"Always delicious and friendly service. I'm stuck on the Singapore noodles right now but my husband likes the sushi, and the Tom Yum (or whatever it's called there) as well as the Pad Thai have gotten good reviews by my group."}
{"text":"After hearing a great review from a coworker about Kung Foo my family and I decided to try it out for our family Thursday night dinner. The restaurant was pretty empty when we first walked in and was seated but by the time we ordered our food there was a wait for a table. Needless to say we came at the right time! We went all out with ordering food so we could try a lot of different entrees on the menu. The Volcano sushi roll was very good!! I could tell the ingredients were fresh and the roll was tasty. We ordered the pork soup dumplings, I would suggest to order these as soon as you sit down if you want them before you start eating your main course. The dumpling take a little longer than anything else but the waitress told us this. The dumplings are huge and really good, my mom really enjoyed them. I ordered the pad sew eeu with chicken which is my favorite Thai dish. I really like it and I rarely can find a restaurant to do them right! I had a good amount of noodles which I can never get enough of. It was a little bit on the sweeter side but a little soy sauce balanced it out. My parents ordered the Mongolian beef with rice and the Walnut Shrimp. Both entrees were good but they kept eating my Pad Sew Eeu lol. Overall we really enjoyed Kung Foo and they will definitely be in our dinner rotation!"}
{"text":"Wow, I am really surprised that I would find soup dumplings in this area.  Are they the best soup dumplings ever?  Nope.  Are they pretty good?  Yes.  The pork belly bun was really tasty.  I really enjoyed my Hong Kong noodle soup with dumplings.  My fiancee really enjoyed her poke tuna bowl.  We need a place like this in South Carolina."}
{"text":"We got the noodle bowls -Lang Xiao (sp?) and Curry kick which is like Thai curry soup basically. We enjoyed them both a lot although if I order it again I would not get the extra vegetables that the waitress recommended I would get it as it comes. Owner came out was very personable and clearly knows his stuff having lived in New York City for many many years working in restaurants there. This is in the middle of Birkdale village and on a quiet Sunday night the place was still half full. We were encouraged to see when we arrive that many patrons were clearly of Asian descent as were many of the staff. It was a beautiful night we sat outside and got to listen to the chirping of the crickets and look at the starry night in the trees as we dined. The place is also dog friendly offering a couple with a pet an outside table off to the side. Unfortunately there was a couple nearby smoking cigarettes which thankfully they didn't start until we were already finished eating but I think a policy of walking away from the tables to smoke might be nice. The warm sake made me less apt to confront the smoking gentleman, and the warm service and excellent food made a very likely will come again very soon!"}
{"text":"Kung Foo Noodle to the rescue! My wife and I were bemoaning the decline in Asian restaurants in Huntersville when we discovered that Tommy had opened Kung Foo Noodle. He has expanded his menu to include dumplings and many new dishes not offered in his previous location.  We ordered takeout and everything was great. If you were a fan of Tommy's other restaurants you'll love Kung Foo Noodle."}
{"text":"We came in the week that it opened and have been regulars ever since.  Sushi is fresh and good; the noodle bowls are very tasty and the wings (seven flavors!) are all wonderful.  I also love the dumplings they have for appetizers.  Very good!  They also do takeout very well.  We just had a great takeout meal: * Volcano roll (My favorite!) * Shrimp Tempura Roll * Curry Kick (awesome Thai coconut & yellow curry soup!) * General Tso Chicken * Pad Thai  It was a fantastic meal for a family of four, and we all had lunch the next day!  The only downside was not being able to eat in the restaurant - the atmosphere is casual and fun with a great caring staff.  Do yourself a favor:  Go to Kung Foo Noodle!"}
{"text":"Home Run!   Cha ching!  Going back - yes please............Totally found this gem by accident.  This location has been cursed with restaurants that just do not make it past six months.  They have broken this curse and my hope is they continue to strive.  Just so you know, this is the original owner of Noodletasia at Exit 23.   Noodletasia was sold, then the new owner sucked, so they closed.   Kung Foo has the same great dishes as Noodletasia, but interestingly enough, for Birkdale it is actually inexpensive.  Average plate is around $10.   Crab Meat Xiao Long Bao - Home made, large, juicy and tasty.  So good.  For reference, last week I was in Montreal, staying in China town.  Every Chinese joint \"specialized\" in dumplings, thus every night for a week, I ate them as an app at the various joints we frequented.  I thought Montreal was good, but Kung Foo's are spectacular.  Also, our awesome server gave us a tutorial on eating them the traditional way, nice of her and I love tradition, but to much work, I simply just shoveled them in :-).  See my pic.  Crab Ragoon's - Fresh rolled and deep fried.  Cream cheese to crab mix is perfect.  My only comment is that the sweet n sour sauce cook have had more flavor, I am sure this was homemade and I am probably used to the sauce at fast food Chinese which is basically thick over sweet gel sauce, just my taste........ See my pic.  Tonkotsu - Pork Belly in bone broth, with poached egg on top.  Need I say more. Yes Pork Belly.   I was a little hesitant about breaking the egg yolk in the broth, but it rocked.  The bone broth is to die for, flavor explosion in my mouth.   I did add a teaspoon of chili oil mix to add some heat.  I did not take a pic, the pics of Tonkotsu that have been posted are pretty representative.  Pad Thai - Very rich and sweet, my wife added sriracha for heat.  The shrimp ratio was good and it was not the largest plate I have seen, it was half the size of traditional Thai take out container.  This is perfect for my wife, since I am a big guy and eat a lot  ---- I would of like a larger portion, but I did not order it.  She said it was the best in the area, that says a lot as I love Thai and we have to go into CLT to find good Thai.  Based on reviews, there is so many menu items we want to try.  Wings!  Yes please.  General Tso!  Hell yes!  Sushi!  I want, I want.    Combine their menu, great staff, an owner that takes time to come to your table and say hello - this is a winning combination.   Also, Kung Foo, go figure they have a dummy in there in case you want to practice your Wing Chun Do :-)"}
{"text":"we stopped by today evening ( Saturday) and came in at 7:40 pm had to wait 25 min. Seating is limited so if ypu are in a rush I suggest to avoid the prime Saturday night. The  hostess when she took our name for the waiting list told us 15 min or less.  once we finally sat down after a long wait, We were ready to order and the server was \" Chelsea\". She seemed friendly and when I asked for Hot & Sour soup she said its available although its not on the menu ( Not sure why ?).  I ordered Singapore Noodle, and this is where my biggest diappointment was.. This was our first visit to this restaurant. The srver did not ask or checked if we want to try any of their sauces.. I overheard the name of the sauces the other server recite them to the table next to us. When our server finally showed up to check on us, I asked her about the sauces she said yes they have then and if I want to try them ?   why couldnt the server Chelsea  offer those sauces when the ,meal was served particularly when we never have been there before was perplxing.  That is the reason I asked her to subtly point  out that she forgot to offer the sauces which I could have tried it on my Singapore noodle which was dry...  Also nobody refilled our water even once.. Also our entrees were served when we we had just started our soups. Typically the etiquette is that you do not seve the main course until the soup/ appetizers are finished...  we felt rushed overall by the server and the service was lacking..  The only saving grace - Quality of the food which was above average"}
{"text":"Awesome - love the menu & Tommy is the best. Start with the wings and have the Chili Beef"}
{"text":"Beef Cho Fun was on point.  Fantastic food!!!!"}
{"text":"Kung Foo Noodle is a hidden gem in the Birkdale Village area -- but it's well worth it to seek it out. Tom, the owner, is a delight to talk to and has a great sense of humor!  But onto the food. There is a good selection of various Asian appetizers and entrees -- banh mi, noodle soups, stir-fried noodles, fried rice, and sushi. But since the place has \"noodle\" in its name, I chose noodles today. I tried the Tom Yum noodles and the Lychee boba tea.  The boba tea is sweet and complemented the spicy Tom Yum soup. And the egg noodles that came with the soup are amazing and were perfectly cooked with the shrimp, bok choy, and mushrooms. Just FYI, it comes piping hot so definitely be careful or you'll singe your tongue!  The service was great and Tom & the server kept coming back to make sure I was OK. So definitely 5 stars there.  I'll definitely be back to try their other stuff!"}
{"text":"I jumped in the door at closing time and they could not have been more gracious.  Often places are rough on late diners and I can understand having worked in many restaurant.   They were the exception.    The food was fantastic.   I highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place was so freaking delicious! I ordered take out for the lunch combo with the orange chicken the other day and it was amazing. Hot, crisp, and the perfect blend of sweet, sour, and spicy. It was ready when I arrived and the service was professional and courteous. I'll be back to dine in for dinner soon!"}
{"text":"This is going to become a regular for me.   I am in love w the Curry Kick and Udon Noodles! Excellent service as well, but do expect a crowd during lunch."}
{"text":"I rarely actually write a review, but I had to for this place. The wings are out of this world. Best in the area. I've never had a bad menu item. Tried sushi here for the first time today and it was delicious!! The staff is great too, friendly and attentive! This is me and my boyfriends go to spot for date night. It's always consistent. Thanks for producing a great product!"}
{"text":"The food and customer service is amazing. The bao bao pork belly melts in your mouth, spicy wonton is a hit, the chicken rice bowl is great and the list goes on. To top it all off, the food price is very reasonable for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great dishes, curry kick was amazing! Would recommend to anyone who loves a bit of spice. Service was great, lovely ambience."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant with amazing service and even better food.  The owner brought our table dessert for our children's birthday and a bag of crabby patties candy! The sesame chicken and dojo sushi roll were delicious"}
{"text":"This is simply the best restaurant for Asian cuisine! Recommend the Curry Kick and Tom Yum soup noodles, Singapore fried noodles, hibachi chicken bowl, egg roll, fried dumplings, crunchy crunchy roll, orange chicken and I could go on. Working on trying everything on the menu, we go there at least once a week. If it's crowded and you can't wait, get take out!"}
{"text":"So I've been dying to come here since I heard they have soup dumplings, but it seems like they have taken them off the menu ?? Noooo :( Anyways I came here for dinner, MUST ORDER NOODLES!! I LOVE noodles, and it seems like their specialty are noodles so yay!! We also ordered the lemon drop sushi to share- pretty good! My mom ordered the udon & instead of chicken she substituted for shrimp. (love how they take substitutions) I got the budae jingae with extra shrimp, beware it has a kick to it(lil spicy) not too spicy though! It was pretty good as well. I tried some of my moms udon, & think I enjoyed my mom udon better. Service was also wonderful, the host- our server were all so friendly! Defiantly will be back, since it's also conveniently located in the birkdale area as well!"}
{"text":"So finding good sushi- like, authentic sushi, seems to be hard to find in the 704 area... until THIS place opened!  I get the \"surprise me\" every time i go there.  \"Surprise me\" is where they literally surprise you with a sushi roll they make up on their own- side note: i am scared to death if change and surprises, so the fact that i let them surprise me is a 5 star review in itself! And each time, i'm like \"they can't get any better than they did last time!\" - and then they DO!  My family is a family of extremely picky eaters, and they always impress us all!  AMAZING food, and our waitress Sarah is THE best waitress I've ever had- by far!  If you get her you will understand!  Also, if you do get her- tell her i sent you!  I'm a regular now"}
{"text":"This place is great! It is absolutely one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte! The prices are reasonable as well. I have been here many times and I have always received great food and service! They specialize in noodle soups so I usually stick to them. They have good appetizers and sushi as well, however. For appetizers they have great wings - large and very crispy! They added bánh mì sandwiches and few other items to the menu. They also have stir fried noodle dishes, rice bowls and fried rice. Although not on the menu they will fix classic Chinese dishes by request. Although very good, why order that when you can get those dishes at any other Chinese restaurant?   OK, now for some recommendations. For wings I really like the Thai Basil, Sesame Chili Garlic and Salt & Pepper wings. Under small plates the Spicy Wontons and Dumplings are very good. For soups, all of them are fantastic but I really like the Lan Zhou, Curry Kick, Budae Jjigae and HotPot (very spicy!). They say their customer favorite is Curry Kick and I see why - outstanding! Lan Zhou has a flavorful beef broth and the Budae Jjigae has so much flavor it's ridiculous! For beverages they have a variety of looseleaf teas, bubble tea, sake, wine and beer Including several local beers - none on draught though."}
{"text":"Awesome, try one of the many \"pho-style\" soups which are a meal alone. Each has its own broth flavor and kick level with a variety of fresh herbs to taste. Good Pad Thai and other traditional dishes round out the offering. Various spice levels for anyone including kids. My four year old loves their noodles with special request fresh veggies substitutes made just for her taste. I have had pretty much everything on the menu. You can't go wrong with any choice."}
{"text":"I read the current reviews and went online to ck out the menu website. No pictures but the prices were average + the people who reviewed this place raves about the food. I ordered the original pad Thai with shrimp- almost 12$I simple have to say I had better. The small shrimp had that frozen then cooked taste to it. I didn't see enough eggs & bean sprouts in it. I was really looking forward to this original plate.  It was ok.  So 2 stars on only the one item. Maybe when I'm around this side of town on lunch I can get the dumplings peeps r taking about. Didn't finish it so I'm still hungry."}
{"text":"Ok I love this place! I have tried almost every noodle on the menu and they are on point delicious. Their spicy wonton is done right, the wonton peel is perfect. My new fav is the bang bang, but I heard it was being taken off menu. So get it while you still can!  I love their Hong Kong which is the wonton noodle soup that I frequently get in Chinatown Nyc and miss so much now that I am in NC. I just wish they gave a bit more noodles w the dish.  Their Lanzhou noodle was also delicious and my husband loves their teriyaki chicken rice bowl.   Sushi-I like their sushi quality over eez. Hands down it's just better quality."}
{"text":"Best Orange chicken I ever had !!!! Nice place and recommend trying the chef special fried rice"}
{"text":"Decent, not something I would go out of the way for again. It was noodles with some limited spices. The dish my husband got that had the \"heat fire\" next to it was bland, no warning necessary.  Will keep looking."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best ramen places anywhere within 100 miles of charlotte. This place compares to the top dogs of authentic Japanese noodles in Los Angeles where I grew up. If you're looking for some delicious hangover food or something to warm your stomach and make you feel things you've never felt about food before, Kung Foo Noodles is the place for you!  Service here is excellent!"}
{"text":"Went here on back to back nights because it was so good! So far I've had the sushi, honey shrimp and chicken fried rice... all excellent and would definitely order again. Small little place where T1 Tapas used to be among others that were short lived, but I expect this one to stick around for a while! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Ordered pick-up. The staff on the phone and in person were very nice and attentive but the food was very bad. Not sure why the reviews are so good. We ordered chicken lo mein, pad thai, chicken fried rice, and orange chicken. The pad thai was flavorless and lacked any hint of peanut or sweetness. The chicken fried rice was extremely plain and lacked any vegetables whatsoever. The lo mein was very good but also lacked vegetables. The orange chicken had a tasty sauce but was overcooked. We won't be going here again."}
{"text":"We have been here multiple times... Yummy food, good customer service, and reasonable price!  One of my favorite restaurant!  Must try!"}
{"text":"Tasty food. Great service. We enjoyed conversing with our waiter. I'll definitely visit again."}
{"text":"This is the best, most authentic noodle bowl I've been able to find since I visited Japan. I've been looking for something to remind me of it, and this is it! My fiancé and I went for lunch, I got the Curry Kick (would add more heat next time) and he got the Hong Kong noodle bowl. We are already thinking about going back for dinner."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Great selection of Thai, Japanese and Chinese food.. everything we tried was good. Great service. I cannot wait to go back and try the sushi."}
{"text":"Stumbled into this place after having out in Huntersville one afternoon. We got lucky as it had just re-opened after a hiatus to make improvements to the inside.   The dishes had a good flavor and were well prepared. I think the portions were a little small, but overall a good place. The service was warm and friendly. I wouldn't drive from Charlotte just to go there, but I would go there if I was in Birkdale Village and choose Kung Foo Noodle over any other offering in the area."}
{"text":"Best Chinese spot in Birkdale.  We've tried a number of things on the menu and never go wrong. We see them at least once a week!"}
{"text":"This place sure does know how to nail some chicken udon. Ive been here almost 5 times and have ordered the chicken udon every single time. Fresh, authentic, and a home run. 10/10 for sure"}
{"text":"Great food. We usually go in a group once a month and have an awesome time. All of us order a little bit of everything and share."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place.  The vegetables in the dishes are so fresh and they make their own sauces to mix into the food.  I saw the table beside us order chicken wings and they looked amazing!  My favorites have been their chef selection sushi and vegetable noodles.  Highly recommend:)"}
{"text":"We love Kung foo, we come here weekly.  Great food, great prices, and the best staff."}
{"text":"LOVE this place.  Good and quick.  Great place for lunch too. Can't wait until they start serving Bubble Tea."}
{"text":"Great place for Asian food, this place has many choices and great quality of food and service. I was here with a friend, we got the sesame garlic wing and steam dumplings for starters. The LAN Zhou noodle is pretty amazing, for Charlotte, this place is good!"}
{"text":"The food and the atmosphere are excellent. This is actually the third restaurant that we follow the owner Tommy, to.  It also has very good sushi, our favorite is the crusty crab roll.    My favorite is the General's, but each of my kids have their own. The soup bowls are very big and filling, we usually have leftovers. The entryway is tight and the place isn't huge, which is one of the things I look like about it.  It has a couple of tv's for the littles, but not really geared towards small children, better for kids that appreciate good food."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese food in town.  The owner Tommy and staff are great, friendly and eager to please. He went out of his way to give my daughter a special desert treat as we ate here for her Birthday. The kids love their food as well. Thank you as always, you will not be disappointed!  Great Soups, Noodles and Sushi."}
{"text":"*great food, wonderful, friendly service We were greeted and seated at the bar right away, offered drinks, checked on frequently and politely. We thoroughly enjoyed our tea, and dinner. This could have been 5 stars, but a serious cleaning seems long overdue. We would have left, but wanted to give our dinner a chance to make up for it. (Menu is a worn collection of 9x11sheets)"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch!  The Tom Yum is the best I've had.  Great sushi as well and the owner and personal made sure we were well taken care of.  Ask the staff for recommendations."}
{"text":"We started with Chinese BBQ wings.  Very tasty.  Hubby got General Tso chicken.  He thought it had good flavor.  I got the Bubba Shrimp sushi.  Yummy.  Can't wait to go again and try more dishes."}
{"text":"Everything was wonderful - the food, the service, the management.  I only wish it were in a bigger space for more seating."}
{"text":"Nice cozy spot with very attentive staff! We shared an order of dumplings which were meaty perfectly cooked and served with a soy based dipping sauce.  We both had the veggie Bahn Mi - the bun was fresh lightly toasted and generous- all the veggies were fresh and a generous portion.   We definitely return and try the Pho next time which we heard was delicious"}
{"text":"LOVE THE ASIAN VARIETY THAT THIS PLACE OFFERS MUST TRY!! I highly recommend- one of the best \"homemade\" style dining . Everything is fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!  The shaolin noodle bowl is my favorite, followed by the curry kick."}
{"text":"First time here...the food was delicious and the atmosphere was great! We went mid afternoon, not too busy, and we had a very kind and attentive server. I can't remember the name of soup that we had, but it was the first one on the list.. fresh, full of flavor and spiced up perfectly!! Will definitely visit this restaurant again when we come back into town."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite restaurant in the area. The owner and staff are always making sure my service and food is excellent. I always try and get new things when I come but commonly get stuck on something because it is just so good. I personally LOVE the Tonkotsu Ramen and I like to add bok choy  and a side of chili oil. As I saw someone else write, they do cater to however you are feeling to ensure the greatest experience. Again and again, I find myself at Kung Foo with new or old company. And as always, I have yet to bring someone who doesn't absolutely love it!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place! The food is right on point, the service is outstanding. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoyed a very nice dinner. The Drunken Noodles were tasty. My wife's Noodle Bowl was Excellent. We were promptly greeted once we entered and quickly seated.  The wait staff were quick and efficient.  Best of all was the price.  Great food, great atmosphere, great value."}
{"text":"We just landed at Concord Regional airport and wanting to have some good ramen. Yelp led us to this trendy looking restaurant in Birkdale Village. Most everything looked interesting so we ordered based on Yelp reviews. It was spot on The curry wings were finger licking good! The salmon poke was fresh and plentiful. The Xiao Long Bao (pork and crabmeat dumpling soup) although not as soupy as the ones we have in NYC, is not bad at all. We were too stuffed to order Ramen, which is what we originally came for but we will certainly return! Oh, and the waiter was friendly too"}
{"text":"First and foremost, I could have gotten worse service if I had a personal waiter.  The people are so incredibly friendly and attentive beyond my dreams.  Though we had one main waiter, anyone that saw our glasses half full were immediately pouring more. The owner/manager(I'm guessing) gave some great tips on eating order and was always paying attention to anything we wanted; He asked if I needed Sriracha right as I thought to ask for Sriracha.  I'm not afraid to call this my best service to date. This and the place was full to capacity as well! Following recent reviews, I played copycat and ordered the Crab soup dumplings, Curry Kick noodles, and some Sushi and Sashimi. Taking the tips from fellow Yelpers, I ordered the dumplings early and that worked out great. The dumplings really were stunning. The soup had just the right amount of kick and the noodles were just about right, with a good amount of chicken in it as well. The Sushi, at first, looked like any other Sushi, but the taste was fresh very fresh.  Usually caterpillar rolls are found more often wrapped in Cucumber and not rice, I misunderstood the description.  Still, very tasty. I had never had a \"lemon drop\" roll, but it really adds a unique kick to the roll with some lemon in it. note:I'm a Sushi NUT and if you look at a review from a few days ago - just had my best Sushi ever - So there IS some immediate bias here). The price was also very reasonable. I can see why this is a CLT top 50!"}
{"text":"Great food, good prices for area.  Staff is friendly; one, even overly much! (in a cute way)  Unfortunately, it's a bit cold inside on a winter day: eat with your jacket on."}
{"text":"Tonight was me and my family's first time being here. Driving by I never noticed it but I saw this place on yelp. It defiantly lives up to its reviews. Everything was so good and everyone who was working there was very nice! I personally had shrimp ramen soup bowl but I tried sushi and chicken pad thai. I have no complaints about anything! It's one of those places you could eat at everyday. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Located in Birkdale Village. The decor is nice, but the food left little to be desired. Very much overpriced and unsatisfying.  1. Kong Kong noodle, lack of noodle  2. Singapore noodle too much curry, portion is very small 3. Fried rice too greasy  Also tried the tonkatsu, it was okay, not amazing and not authentic enough. And the Pork Banh Mi, probably the best out of all the items ordered.  Our waiter was extremely perky. Also the water here is straight up funny tasting, I had to ask for lemon to bury the bad taste..It was like tap water gone bad. Everything was quite over priced, if you want bubble tea, it is $5, dang! When you have a restaurant named kung fu noodle, I am going to try your noodle but none of the noodle dish we tried were good."}
{"text":"Over rated , Microwaved food at Best , Friendly Service , Cool atmosphere , if your on a first date with some one , your will never see that date again if you come here to eat.."}
{"text":"Glad to see another Asian option at Birkdale. However, the overall quality was mall food court quality. Hate to say that for a new place but going here was regrettable. The Crab Rangoon was day old chewy. The Thai Basil wings were well cooked and meaty but the sauce was so salty I could stomach only 2 of 6 wings. The Pad Thai was greasy, flavourless, and the chicken had a highly suspect taste. The only thing I enjoyed was a few pieces of sashimi. Service was decent and the manager did check on us....but we couldn't get past the food. Sorry...your kung foo is not strong grasshopper."}
{"text":"I just visited King Foo Noodle for the first time and absolutely loved it! The service was great, the atmosphere was cool, and the food was delicious. I had the spicy pork/shrimp won tons, and the lan zhou soup. I actually mixed the two (won tons and spicy sauce in the soup) per the waitress' recommendation and it was awesome."}
{"text":"I really like this place. The staff is super friendly, the food is always good and its all at a reasonable price. The space is a bit small so expect to wait during peak time."}
{"text":"IF anyone knows Tommy Tong (the owner) you would understand that this new venture was going to be great.  We went there today and had a sampling of sushi, noodles, wings, and rice bowls.  I wish I could have tasted everything on the menu in one night, have to go back soon.  The staff and service is top knotch and the new décor and fresh appearance makes it a fun place to have dinner.  All the new and traditional items on the menu leave something for everyone!!!!"}
{"text":"Kung Foo Noodle is not in the best location - while the rest of Birkdale Village is hopping, they are a bit on the outskirts. Even if you know where you are going, it can be a bit of a challenge. Don't get me wrong - it is nice to not be right in the middle of the madness that is Birkdale, but at the same time, if you are a business, I am sure it is work to figure out the logistics of it all.  Couple that with the appearance, and I am sure they have their work cut out for them. This is an area they are addressing - so be sure and check with them if you are heading up any time soon, as signs were advertising that they were taking on some changes soon for remodeling!  To say that the interior is bare is putting it mildly. It looks like you have stumbled into a dance club that has shut down and someone decided to start up a restaurant before anyone notices that the rent payments have stopped coming (to their credit, this may be because of the remodeling process).   However, the staff is very friendly, and helpful on getting your order right, so be sure and ignore the current state of the place. Or just close your eyes and go with it. The food is worth a visit. The appetizer portions especially are worth it - the entrees, perhaps not so much, as they are reminiscent of most Chinese food. Not that they are bad, they are just more typical and you can get them about anywhere. Take the chance to try something better."}
{"text":"Lately I've been pretty disappointed with Noodletasia since it used to be my absolute favorite Asian restaurant. Then I found out that the owner of Noodletasia has changed and the previous owner now opened Kung Foo noodle. So obviously I followed him to his new restaurant and was so happy I did.  Kung Foo is tucked into the back corner of Birkdale village, a little easy to miss. We sat outside and had little passers-by looking at our food, watching us eat, unlike other restaurants in Birkdale.  We ordered the Xio Long Bao (pork meat soup dumplings) and sesame chili garlic wings and decided to split the Basil Chili Chicken. Our entree came before the dumplings or wings. NBD.  The Basil Chili Chicken completely blew our minds. It was delicious, and we would have it again next time. The dumplings were good too. Wings, not a fan of the dry-rubbed style. Next time we will probably get the ones with sauce. However the wings were really well marinated and the flavor had seeped in all the way to the bone. Not a common thing.  The server also told us that while their menu is different from Noodletasia, they will make certain things from the old Noodletasia menu even if it's not on the Kung Foo menu. Just ask!"}
{"text":"Dang. We did not have that good of a experience here compared to our first visit. We came in and put our name on the list. It was about a 25 minute wait. No biggie, it was a saturday night. We came with a party of 4. We got sat at a corner table. We waited for a while and a guy offered to get our drinks. We got our drinks and just waited....and waited. Finally another guy walked buy and asked if we got our drink order yet. Well, yeah. Waited again. No one came by. Finally the original guy comes by and asked if our server came by yet. We didn't know who it was so we told him no. Finally, a girl comes by and just takes our order.  The whole table ordered 2 rolls, hot pot, lang zhao, pad see ew, and beef lo mein noodles. The rolls were delicious. Very fresh and tasty. I got the hot pot and the broth was not good. Now, I know it was gonna be spicy. I'm asian so I can eat spice like you wouldn't believe. The spice didn't bother me. The sourness of the broth bothered me. It was so sour. My husband liked his lang zhao soup. My friend got the pad see ew and she thought it was ok. By this time, we were still waiting on the beef lo mein noodles. It took a good 5-6 mins before it came out after everyone else. In all seriousness the guy that got the beef lo mein noodles eats anything and everything. He ate 90% of it. Not because he was full but because he said it was so salty. I was literally surprised. The service was. It just sucks that we drove all the way here for mediocre food and service when the last time we came here was absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"Great little hidden place. Was very skeptical but so glad that we gave it a chance. We had 7 people and we all ordered different things and everything was delicious. We will make this place our weekly spot."}
{"text":"Great food. Owner is friendly. This place is Amazing. Good sushi. A little hard to find but it is behind Bad Daddy's Burgers."}
{"text":"I was reading local reviews recently and I am glad to see a food option I'm interested to try in Birkdale Village! I was going up that way to stop on Williams Sonoma so I figured why not. The restaurant was empty on Monday afternoon but they opened about a week ago. Every person that spoke to me was nice and made sure I was doing ok. I wanted to try too many things but I was eating alone so I settled on soup dumplings and a sushi roll. The sushi was really good and appropriately sized to be comfortably eaten! It came out first and the dumplings second. The waitress told me they would take 10-15 minutes. I would say the sushi was 4 star and the dumplings 3. I've just had better! They were thick with dough and light on soup filling. Good taste just not enough soup. Still, I will be back to try the noodle dishes and chicken wings."}
{"text":"Food is good here... service is very good!! I really liked their Pad Thai dish, even though they aren't a \"Thai\" place, I would highly recommend it. Sushi is okay and other plates my family ordered seemed good. I would try them again."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in Huntersville hands down. Cute atmosphere and the service is always attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"My office eats here at least 3 times a week!  The best Pho ever and the Hot Pot is our favorite!  The staff and owner are friendly and always make us want to return.  I don't write reviews, but I would suggest this to everyone unless it gets too busy, and then I'll get upset!"}
{"text":"Finally have a decent Chinese/Asian fusion restaurant in this area! I mean authentic, and don't need to drive 45 mins. We ordered Lan Zhou la mian, lo mien, hot pot, spicy wonton, Singapore noodle. They are all very good. Too bad that they don't sell soup dumplings any more."}
{"text":"So I'm not sure what happened, or when it happened, because I haven't been to Kung Fu since before they closed down to make some changes for a few weeks. We started getting our soups elsewhere in the area...I've been getting the Tom Yum from Thai-Sushi 101 and some other places around town.   Today we decided that we wanted some noodles and I decided to go with my new fav (the tom yum). My sister got the Kung Fu Noodles and we both added veggies.   Again, I'm not sure what happened but the flavors at this place seem to have diminished to almost nothing! Everything was really bland...the noodles, the veggies, the shrimp, and worst of all, the broth! Tom Yum is known for being spicy and citrusy...this was neither. The broth was very thin and watery...like it came out of a box. I added some lime and Sriracha to it, and it helped a little bit. The sadder part is that after I tried my sisters I realized it could get worse. Once more, idk what happened, but I was really disappointed this time around.      Previous Review:  One word: Tonkotsu. Okay, more words: So we had previously gotten our ramen fix from Futo Buta in South End, but since moving to Huntersville I was pleased to find a place that served it near by. The soup was actually pretty good, certainly a worthy competitor of its Charlotte counterpart...especially at a price that sits around 25% less at lunch...and still comes in cheaper at dinner. PLUS the man who took my call-in order and gave us our food was super sweet. I will definitely be back, and possibly be taking fewer trips south. Now, if I could only find pho in this area that can challenge my Midwood spot..."}
{"text":"When I saw this land at #10 on the #YelpCLTTop50 2016 list, I had to go check it out for myself. And it definitely did not disappoint. Two words: SOUP DUMPLINGS.   Christi K and I ventured up here for lunch. Our order: couple hot teas, Crab Meat Xiao Long Bao (soup dumpling with pork and crab meat), Tonkotsu ramen, and Tom Yum soup. Please note: the soup dumplings take about 10-15 minutes. They are worth the wait. Put those in when you order your drinks. Also, shout out to Jared M for his review tip of requesting the dumpling sauce (less vinegar-y) with your soup dumplings. Don't get me wrong, the sauce that comes with them is good, but personally I liked the dumpling sauce much better. Everything was delicious. Christi's ramen had like four giant pieces of pork belly and it was so good. I loved my tom yum.   The service was great. Everyone here is so nice. On top of a fantastic meal and experience, it was also super affordable. The soup bowls are just $8 during lunch and $10 at dinner. Our total bill for lunch was just $30 before tip.   I can't wait to come back and try their wings, buns, and other delicious soup bowl options. I was so excited about the soup dumplings, I somehow completely overlooked the fact they have two poke options on their menu!"}
{"text":"My family and I tried Kung Foo Noodle on Friday night and it was delicious! We started with the pork dumplings and they were amazing. My daughter had the sesame chicken (lunch portion) and it was so good! My wife and I both got sushi and they were both great. I had the caterpillar roll. My wife had the beauty and the beast roll. We will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Loved everything, but the Chinese BBQ wings and the pork belly sliders were really awesome. The service was efficient and courteous. Cool decor, too. I'm sad they're going to be closed for renovations."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this a 3.5, because 4 feels a little high but it's definitely not a 3. Explored the menu here, having the xiao long bao, pork bao bao, tonkotsu, and tuna poke. Xiao long baos were a little bit of a disappointment, as I expected more flavor. But they weren't bad by any stretch. The pork bao bao was very good, as the pork belly was the main source of flavor. The rice cake on it was fluffy, but lacking the traditional baobao taco-look (it was more like a sandwich here). The tonkotsu ramen left much to be desired...the broth lacked a lot of flavor, and should have been steeped with the pork belly which had phenomenal flavor. Bean sprouts killed the flavor entirely and should have been left out. And a poached egg? Usually a boiled and marinated egg is in the bowl...the poached egg did not have the flavor that a traditional marinated egg would have. The bamboo shoots also had an odd flavor like they'd been taken in and out of a freezer many times...they didn't have the traditional crunch when they're 'fresh' from the jar. The poke tasted nothing like Hawaiian poke, and was missing the signature flavors, and instead just having a mix of soy sauce and hoisin. The seaweed was also the wrong variety for the dish. Would I go back? Yes. In Charlotte/Huntersville, beggars can't be choosers if they crave ramen. This isn't Japan, LA, or Hawaii but it suffices well enough. I'll try their sushi next time!"}
{"text":"My go to place for food in Birkdale!  The Curry Kick noodle dish is the absolute best and I also love the edamame app.  Tommy, the owner, is always so attentive and never disappoints!"}
{"text":"So my mother and I stumbled upon this place while searching for a lunch spot in Birkdale Village. (It is located on the street beside Bad Daddy's Burgers off the main strip.) It was so good that when my hubby came home and wanted to take us out, we chose this place again. First visit, I ordered the Crab Rangoons and Chicken Lo Mein with extra veggies. My mom had the Honey Walnut Shrimp. Everything was very well seasoned and flavorful.  Second visit, I had the Shrimp Lo Mein, mom had the Curry Kick, and hubby had the Thai Basil wings and Shrimp Fried Rice. Once again everything was great and the food came out quickly.  On both visits the staff was very friendly and attentive. A gentleman who appeared to be the owner, checked in on us and was very welcoming. The decor was nice as well. I will definitely eat here again and try some Sushi."}
{"text":"Best Asian restaurant around.  Affordable, tasty and friendly staff.  Soups are great."}
{"text":"We went there with a party of 4 adults and 2 children for an early lunch. We were promptly seated. The service was great and the food was fast! The prices were very reasonable.  Although the menu clearly states they do not have a gluten free menu, everyone went out of there way to ensure my son's meal was safe for him to eat. We will definitely return!   Just be aware that the dishes that say spicy are HOT!! Some of the dishes we ordered were: honey walnut shrimp, caterpillar sushi roll, noodle soup bowl, and singapore noodles. Everyone was very happy. My son loved his sushi roll!"}
{"text":"Kung Foo Noodle is in Birkdale Village..and turns out it is awfully good.  Everything we had was delicious and you can bring your dogs with you and sit on the patio.  It was a perfect night for it, too.  We started with Dumplings.  The waitress advised us to get the pan-fried ones because the steamed dumplings got cold and gummy.  She was right.  Those little pork filled nuggets were warm, just crispy and perfect when dipped in the sauce.  That was a favorite.  We also tried the Spicy Wontons.  I thought wontons were crispy, but here they were steamed and very pliant.  Even though it wasn't what we thought, these soft pillows filled with pork and shrimp were incredible and we all agreed (even our seafood hater!) that we'd get them again.  For my dinner, I had the Tom Yum Noodle Bowl.  It was so spicy and delicious!  Sour broth chock full of homemade noodles, shrimps, bok choy and flavored with lemongrass.  If I ever get sick, someone better bring me this soupy goodness.  It's miracle healing level good.  Ty got his standard: Pad Thai!  He said it was sweet and delicious, with peanuts, chicken and chewy noodles.  It came with 2 limes to counter balance the sweetness of the sauce with a little added acid.  Perfect!  Mary Ashley got her standard: Sushi.  She had two rolls.  The first was called Bubba Shrimp roll.  It was tempura friend shrimp in the middle, with ebi shrimp on top, covered with shrimp sauce.  It was her favorite. She wouldn't let me try it.  Her second roll was a Volcano roll, which was a friend roll with crab and crab salad. She did let me try that, and it was really really good.  Especially with the cream cheese inside.  Loved!  For dessert we got Bubble Tea!  The tea part was delicious, but I'm on the fence about those bubbles.  They are gelatinous masses (Tapioca pearls, I've heard) that are barely flavored and just make your drink chewy.  I don't get it.  Anyway, we got Thai tea flavored and Mary Ashley got Taro.  Hers was the best...it tasted like a sugar cookie.  The service here was also impeccable.  The place is smallish on the inside, but it was not overflowing with folks when we got there.  Lots of windows and high ceilings do a lot for not feeling crowded.  We've found a new favorite spot.  (This is from my blog, Barenakedchefsaidso...not plagiarizing!)"}
{"text":"This place is sheer perfection. I highly recommend the Kung foo noodle bowl. So much perfection!  The crab Rangoon is also super delicious. I wish it was closer to home!"}
{"text":"I take friends and family here all the time! Their noodle soups are amazing. So happy to be near a place that has soup dumplings as well."}
{"text":"This is our go to place for amazing casual pan-asian favorites. Clean, friendly and fast - we love this place for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"The Pad See Ew is awesome! Very flavorful and authentic noodles. We also tried the Curry Kick soup because of the great Yelp reviews but honestly, I wish I would've just ordered noodles instead. Will definitely be coming back for more"}
{"text":"Great food! Vegan and vegetarian food. Friendly and wonderful service! Nice beer choices. Relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great place! I eat here once a week. The sushi is wonderful and the wings..amazing!! The service is always great and of course the prices are the best. I recommend this place over any other similar restaurants in the area. I bring everyone here!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Great dishes, atmosphere and service.  I've had multiple menu items but one of favs is the Pad Thai with tofu.  There was also another item, it was called hot,spicy curry noodle or something like it can't quite remember the name. Anyway they made it vegan for me and i really appreciate it. It was delicious too.  Believe one of the owners, or manger, was formerly over Noodletasia. I use to love that place too so I was happy to see him again.  Diffintely a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Love this place! Definitely a great addition to Birkdale and well needed. We love that they have a mix of foods and they are all good. My favorites are the Bao Bao they offer and the Si Fu fried rice so delicious. The staff is great too."}
{"text":"Kung Fu Noodle is a great spot for lunch. An $8 bowl of soup noodles will definitely fill you up. I have tried the Tonkotsu, Moo Moo, Curry Kick, and Ramen. They are all really delicious and flavorful. I definitely recommend the Curry Kick if you like coconut milk.   We also ordered sesame chili garlic wings; it had an intoxicating smell. Lastly, we got the \"famous\" soup dumplings, both the xiao long bao and the crab meat xiao long bao. Honestly, I did not think they were worth the hype. Most of them weren't filled with soup, and fillings lacked flavor. The dipping sauce that came with it had overwhelming amount of vinegar.  Overall, I recommend sticking to the noodles. It's perfect for everyone."}
{"text":"I have to move it down to a 4 for two reasons:  One, I wasn't thrilled to hear that they were changing their menu. I will still eat here because the food is good, but this will limit our options.   Two, and more importantly, we sat by a window and noticed dust and a dead fly on the windowsill, as well as fingerprints all over both windows near our table. We could tell that this wasn't from the day we dined there. It was not appetizing, but we overlooked it and enjoyed the food anyway.   The service was excellent, even though we had three different people serving us. Maybe it was a shift change.   Still recommended."}
{"text":"This is our go-to place for Chinese. They're chicken wings are soooo good!!!! Honestly that's what has us coming back! The Chinese bbq wings are delicious!! So is the chow mein!! My 7 year old is also a HUGE fan and she can be picky about restaurants. We are definitely regulars and love this place!! The service has been great so far. We also order the sushi which is fresh and flavorful every time! The rainbow, lemon drop, and California roll are staples of our usual order. This place is definitely worth your time."}
{"text":"Warning!  Don't come here because this is a hidden gem.   I've held off on this review for months because I'm selfish and want to keep this place to myself. As a 20 year chef and traveling food critic, I've never experienced any better \"street food\" in my life.   The owner has brought his interpretation of traditional culturally loved \"street food\" and put his signature on it.   Try the dumplings, the wings, the noodle bowls....hell try everything. Just make a promise. Once you fall in love with this place and become addicted like a crackhead craves their next hit. Just save me a seat."}
{"text":"This is my go to comfort food place to eat. The staff makes you feel welcome from the minute you walk in the door. You never lack for attention; from the owner to the kitchen staff to   the wait staff you get the best service all around. My favorite is the chicken udon. Rich in flavor. Noodles cooked just right, the bok choy has just the right crunch, and the broth is always flavorful. I kick my bowl up a notch with sweet chili sauce. My comfort food in a bowl."}
{"text":"Outstanding!!!  Met the infamous Tommy - very pleasant, friendly, helpful.  Bao Bao Dumplings were great.  Tuna Poke was amazing.  Lamb Curry bun was tasty.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is totally legit and Asian approved!  The Singapore noodles was just the way it's supposed to be with scrambled eggs, shrimp, chicken, bean sprouts, green onions dry fried with rice vermicelli in Indian curry powder with lots of wok hey.  The general tsao's chicken was also quite tasty, but I would have preferred a dark thigh meat instead of boneless white meat chunks.  However, the egg roll was spectacular!  The filling tasted of pork, carrots and cabbage, but in a good way.  There isn't a lot of seating area and there seems to be a somewhat private nook to the right of the sushi table.  I'm generally not a fan of places that does sushi and Chinese, but the sushi looked decent.  Also, they serve sliders. They don't look like the momofuku gua bao caliber and I thought they were a tad pricey for just one, so I'd stick to the noodles.  This place did hit the hunger spot.  It's darn delicious!"}
{"text":"Not only is everything we have had here delicious, but they are EXTREMELY accommodating!  I am the master of making my order difficult and they don't even blink and eye at my requests.  \"Sure!\" Is the response every time. And to top it off, they don't nickel and dime us.  We change the noodles or the meat or the veggies, no extra cost, and no problem!  Love this place!   My son LOVES the wings and me and hubby love the noodle bowls and several of the apps.  Highly recommend!!!  Tommy the owner is the master of this place!  He is here every time we have come and he checks on every table and answers the phone and seats people and makes sure they will fill our difficult order:). That is serious service!"}
{"text":"LOVE The food, LOVE the owner and the staff, and LOVE the atmosphere and location. Sushi is plated beautifully quenching all of your senses at once. Great amount and quality for the price. There bathrooms and tables are always clean and the food is served within reasonable time and on attractive dish ware. Recommend getting the \"surprise me\" if your an adventurous eater and respect Sushi. But even if you don't like sushi all of there dishes I have tried are awesome!"}
{"text":"Go to spot for sushi, pad Thai, and lo mein. Have yet to have something on the menu I did not love.. Portions are HUGE and enough for two meals. They even have hibachi bowls, which are delicious as well. Tommy the host is very friendly. They can prepare a to go order in around 10 minutes. It gets very busy on weekend nights, so it is often worth opting for takeout. Overall, one of my favorite Asian restaurants ever!"}
{"text":"I'm addicted to the curry kick. Okay, sometimes the chicken tastes a little like cardboard: tastes and over cooked, but the broth is amazing! So, it doesn't bother me enough to drop a star.  My fiancé fancies the hibachi and tends to get that every time we order here.   The staff are always friendly and the service is pretty quick."}
{"text":"Really surprised that I haven't reviewed Kung Foo. I work literally right across the street and go here at least once every two weeks. It's kind of a staple.  Kung Fu is one of the only places in the area where you can get Xiao Long Bao (I've only had the original, no fanciness) and my world has changed a little bit. Soup dumplings. No, not dumplings in soup, silly southerners. Soup in Dumplings. Magic. Aside from that, there's a healthy assortment of almost anything else you could want: Pho, normal Entrees (General Tso, Sesame Chicken), Sushi, and other goodies (wings, fried rice bowls, and even some poke!). Food is delicious and everything I've ordered thus far has been pretty stellar. Defintely recommend the Curry Kick bowl as well as the Singapore Noodles.   Service is fast and pleasant. The owner is there most of the time and he's always checking on how we are. That's part of the reason why I keep on coming back - you have the owner seriously invested in how his restaurant is doing. You'll see me there next week :)"}
{"text":"So nice. I really like this place and did not even know about it until I read about it on yelp.  The place is not to large but the wait was not long. we had the udon and chicken soup and dumplings. All very fresh. I will be back and soon. the waitress was super sweet. the older gentleman seemed to be very rushed running to take your credit card before you got the bill, but I think he just wanted to clear the table for the next people. Cant wait to try the other soups"}
{"text":"I can't say enough great things about this place. The food is amazing. The service is incredible. One of the things I missed after moving from Los Angeles was good ramen. I found it at King Foo Noodle. The ramen, the sushi, the poke, the wings and even the noodle dishes are excellent. It's also the best fried rice in town."}
{"text":"Another visit. Another happy tummy. Got the General Tso's this time it blew away any other General Tso's I've ever had like the wolf against at straw house. All the other Tso's are now demoted to corporal. Great sweat, almost smoky flavor. The kid got the Mongolian Beef and couldn't get enough. Beats out that place with the horse in front like it was a rented mule. Service was quick as always. They pop up like elves helping Santa. No, buzzing the tower from the manager either. Tommy (the owner) checks in on you at least three times and can have an actually conversation. Wife says the soup was amazing. Can't tell you from personal experience, looked up and it was gone. Bottom line, if you where in the area and choose somewhere else you choose poorly.    Best Pad Thai I've had in a loooong time! My wife got the Hong Kong soup and said it was delicious as well. Service was fast too."}
{"text":"Hidden in the back part of Birkdale, this place exudes a hip New York like atmosphere. The decor is modern and sophisticated. The waitstaff is exuberant and the service is prompt and efficient.A selection of fried chicken wings with six different finishes. We tried the spicy Thai basil and the spicy garlic wings. Both were out of this world good. A huge selection of sushi choices work many interesting rolls and presentations. A huge variety of soups including an excellent tonkatsu ramen and a very good vegetarian noodle soup. There are rice bowls and assorted Asian noodles such as pad see ew. This restaurant is like the best Asian restaurant north of charlotte and perhaps on the entire region. Particularly because of its very reasonable price points. I will be back again and again."}
{"text":"I love their pork buns and dumpling and everything else! They also have a variety of noodle soup. The service is great! The boss is always nice and attentive"}
{"text":"We just tried Kung Foo Noodle last night!  We we very, very pleased with the service and the food was delicious!  We eat at Eez often, but found that Kung Foo was very authentic and sooooo tasty!!!!  We have been to Shanghai, and this food reminded us of the great food there! Had the spicy broth beef with noodles!  Excellent!!!  Very tasty!!!  The wontons were probably some of the best we've ever had!!!  The Singapore stir fry noodles was also very good!  No complaints!  Well, one, they don't have their liquor license--yet.  But, they should have it very soon!!  We didn't mind, because the food was soooooooo good!!  Of course, we went to Corkscrew afterwards. . But, remember, Corkscrew allows you to bring in food, as long as you purchased it from within Birkdale Village!!  So, why not do that too??! . We highly recommend Kung Foo Noodle!!!   We hope people will give it a try, because we want it to do well--selfish reasons....we love the food!!  It's in the location across from that dry cleaner.  Unfortunately many people don't go back there; therefore, they don't know Kung Foo Noodle is there.  But it is!!  Give it a try!  Pretty sure you will thoroughly enjoy their tasty, authentic menu!"}
{"text":"good food, some items very good, super friendly attentive service, and very rea$onably priced (two dinner entrees and an app cost $30)  Got steamed pork dumplings--good!  Mongolian beef my bf got was excellent, heaping portions for just $10 at dinner and had lots of vegetables(onions, scallions...?). Mongolian beef had almost a smoky flavor. Delicious. The pad see ew was awesome!!! I asked to make it spicy & would get it again like that.   A top option in birkdale village, in my opinion. I'm happy I tried this place! So far no msg headache either :)   Got takeout of general tso chicken and won't order it again... steamed vegetable dumplings weren't very good."}
{"text":"Okay, I'm converted. Our second time made me see what the hype is about.  I was crazy-stalking Yelp looking for some good ramen in the Huntersville area, and I found Kung Foo and a great picture. And I'm so happy to say that I craving is satisfied!  The tonkatsu ramen was delicious, everything from the pork to the egg to the noodles and all the veggies!   The service was great - it was my first time meeting Tommy, the owner. It seemed like a lot of regulars know him, and he took the time to come over and introduce himself to us! He mentioned if there is anything that we don't see on the menu, he'd be happy to make it for us too! If that's not great ownership, I don't know what is.  Based on Tommy and the ramen alone, I will 100% come back ....maybe tomorrow?"}
{"text":"The people here are the sweetest. They are very attentive. The food is ready right away. I had the rainbow roll and the dumplings and they were to die for. I would definitely recommend this place and trying there noodle dishes."}
{"text":"Second time here and the food and service was much better this time around! I'm so glad I gave it another chance. Servers were really nice and welcoming. Owners were there also. I liked how attentive they were to the patrons.   I ordered the Pad See Ew and it was delicious. I asked for the broccoli to be cooked a little more and the dish came out to be perfection. My boyfriend ordered the Hibachi rice bowl. The beef was tender. The bowl overall with the white sauce was yummy.   Definitely would come here again and recommend to others to try."}
{"text":"A gem tucked away in the back of Birkdale Village. Friendly service and nice decor. We ordered a California roll, Xiao Long Bao (soup dumplings), Tonkotsu and Mongolian beef. The California roll was solid, nothing special but still a nice start to the meal. The Xiao Long Boa was good but not the best I've had. If you've never had Xiao Long Boa though, you definitely should try it! The staff will explain how to eat it (which is great because I had no idea what I was doing the first time) and it's a fun experience. My husband had the Tonkotsu ramen, which was tasty and came with lots of pork. The broth wasn't as rich as we've had it at other places but still very tasty. I had the Mongolian beef and it was delightful! Tender beef, with lots of onions and a savory but slightly sweet taste. I had a big enough portion for a lunch the next day. I'm excited to come back and try more things!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Asian place in Huntersville and around the Charlotte area. The food is awesome and the service is always great. Don't bother with the other Asian place in Birkdale, this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"What a great surprise this was! The food is excellent and the selection is unbelievably wide.  Everything from soup bowls to stir fry to hibachi to sushi. Really, really good food."}
{"text":"I came here to get my soup dumpling fix, as it's been difficult to find a place in the area (or in the surrounding two states) that offers them. Verdict: those are pretty good dumplings! Not the best I've ever had, but they had a nice amount of soup inside, which is important for the dish.  What threw me off was the long wait for our food (and it was also staggered weirdly, so both my dishes came out and my partner had nothing...for a good while). Also, the plates and bowls were kinda weird...like black plastic Toys R Us dishes you'd buy so a toddler can't break them. I don't know why, but it really threw me off, and it made me feel like I paid too much for the food. Good rule of thumb: present your food on nice dishes so the dishes look nice. Also my partner was legit sitting on a black box. Maybe they should buy some real chairs too.  I'll probably be back, but warning: this place gets very busy, and there's not much seating."}
{"text":"The ramen was exceptional ! The dumplings could get some work done but overall was good for the price! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Overall I was quite happy with my visit. The boys were gone and I ventured up here on my own and like a true foodie I ordered everything. Okay not everything but I ordered quite a bit for one person.  **XIAO LONG BAO - I love a good soup dumpling. It's noted on the menu that you have to wait several minutes for these, so I ordered immediately upon sitting. They finally came out and as a previous yelper mentioned - the skin is quite thick. But I can deal with that. The vinegar dipping sauce helps cut through it. However, my soup dumplings lacked what they needed most - Soup. One was completely dry and those that did have soup - it was very minimal. I would highly suggest skipping these. I ended up taking some home and didn't even finish the leftovers. 1/5  **KUNG BAO - HOLY HELL BATMAN! So good, so freaking good. I wasn't sure how it was going to be with condensed milk on fried chicken but it works. It is on the slightly sweet side but the chicken and bao help counter that and balance the flavors. So good. If only they put a little cilantro on this. But I ate it all. Almost ordered another. 5/5  **CURRY MAD WINGS - Essentially you are getting two whole wings for $7.50. Not sure how I feel about that. Well I lie, I think it is too expensive. Other than the price for the quantity of food, this was alright. It wasn't a huge favorite for me but still good flavors. I took leftovers home and didn't touch them either. But I think for others it would be amazing. 3.5/5  **Moo Moo Noodle Soup - This really was the perfect soup. The meat was soft and tender, they had pieces of beef that were chewy and authentic to what would typically find. The broth was complex with flavor but light. The bok choy was crisp and bright green. The noodles were chewy and had a nice bight to it. I ate it all. Every single last drop. 5/5  I would definitely come back - my bao and soup were off the chain good. My service was good but I went around 430 and it was before their dinner rush started. So for a while it was just me in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in Huntersville and especially in Birkdale. The food is amazing and worth the trip. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"I was really excited when I discovered I no longer have to travel back home (NYC) to get my Xiao Long Bao (soup dumplings) or Poke fix. However, I was really disappointed with the lack of broth in the soup dumplings. My coworker had little to no broth in hers and didn't get the experience I love about eating them. If the owner is reading this, PLEASE PUT MORE BROTH IN THEM!   Other than that, love the friendly staff and the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Local noodle and sushi place tucked in the back of Birkdale village.  They recently reopened adding more  options like banh mi and bubble tea.  Don't miss it as having a go to option for good, very reasonably priced meals in Birkdale is not always easy.  Recommend salt and pepper wings, tonkotsu ramen, Hong Kong noodles and sashimi.  Tommy the owner, is one of the friendliest and hardest working guys you will ever meet.  Talking with him, you will be rooting for him to succeed.  Check Kung Foo out, you will be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Always good to have a new place to try close by so this Friday brought us to the recently opened Kung Foo Noodle in Birkdale Village. The location has previously been a Tapas place that started great and slid downhill and then a Mexican type joint that my wife liked but I always thought was just OK.   Kung Foo brings another Asian place to BV but one that has some more authentic Chinese along with takeout place standards like General Tsos chicken and some sushi rolls. We opted for the more traditional fare like the crab and pork soup dumplings and the Lan Zhou noodle bowl. We also tried the spring rolls and were really pleased with all we tried. The food was fresh, with good depth of flavor in every dish. The broth for the noodle bowl was rich with just the right amount of heat and the sauces that came with the roll and the dumplings were wonderful compliments. The beef slices in the noodle bowl were very tender and you could get chicken or lamb as other protein options.   Can only agree with the other reviewers comments on the friendliness of the staff. It's clear they want the guests to feel comfortable and are very helpful.   Kung Foo does takeout as well and we plan to be frequent diners."}
{"text":"Service was courteous and very fast. We ordered the Curry Kick and the Thomkatsu. The latter had good umami flavor, but seemed to be missing something. The Curry Kick was flavorful and my favorite of the two. Finished it off with a coconut bubble tea which was delicious. Very affordable and lots of other interesting things on the menu."}
{"text":"I loved the red and black decor as soon as I stepped inside. I'm not the most familiar with Birkdale Village so it took a few trys to locate the restaurant. I had assumed it would have been on the Main Street like the other restaurants I had been too, but it was around the corner from Bad Daddy's. Sunday night, most of the other eateries were packed to the gills. I was actually relieved when I saw there were only a few patrons inside Kung Foo, so my date and I were seated immediately.  I tried to talk her into some wings, but she refused, opting for beef lo mein. The beef was very tender and the portion was a good size. I ordered shrimp fried rice and the Chun Li sushi roll which had shrimp, crabmeat, avocado. I was very pleased with both dishes. I picked another winner!"}
