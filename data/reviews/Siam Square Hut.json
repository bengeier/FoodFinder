{"text":"Fantastic food and value. Homemade taste and the spicy option has a great kick. Definitely coming back to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Great food, definitely coming back. I would order more frequently if there was free delivery in the neighbourhood or deals on pick up."}
{"text":"This was an excellent Thai place. The owner was extremely nice and was originally from Southeast Asia. We had the pad Thai and two other dishes and really enjoyed them all."}
{"text":"This restaurant is just around the corner from where I live and I never thought about trying it out until I saw an article on it on BlogTo a few months ago. The article mentioned high Authenticity and use of real spices that make this restaurant the real deal. I've tried the red panang curry, pad see ew, cashew chicken, and Siam square hut curry- they were all phenomenal. They also offer 3 levels of spice: mild, medium, and hot. My boyfriend and I love extremely spicy food and we tolerate it pretty well, so we thought we'd try hot. They are NOT kidding with their spice, it is . This place is a hidden gem in my opinion. If you're ever in the area (Leaside) and you're craving authentic Thai/Malaysian food, don't past this gem."}
{"text":"We ordered for takeout for our first time getting any food from here. (mid 2016; just posted it late) I'm disappointed, though the sticky rice with mango at the end of our meal was really good. Perfect level of not-to-sweet but sweet enough; the sesame seeds on the rice complemented it well, and the mango was at the right stage of ripeness. 
On the other hand, the main meal was just ok, with the glass noodles ending up being with seafood (rather than what I would expect of chicken and shrimp and maybe tofu unless otherwise specified). The biggest problem was that the dishes were generally greasy and overcooked. Flavours were murky rather than fresh or developed. It wasn't absolutely terrible, but \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" is exactly the right description. I gave a very flat feeling to what was a special occasion that should have been elevated with good food. 
The sticky rice would almost take it to a 3 but since I expected so much more based on other reviews, 2 it is. I don't plan to go again."}
{"text":"Excellent, very tasty, had the dinner for four. Tom yum soup was really good will definitely come again."}
{"text":"Went for lunch, were actually the first customers of the day, and we loved everything.
All the food was fresh, and was served very quickly.
The service was attentive without the server hovering all the time, and when we requested additional items, they came out right away.
Very small and casual. More than enough parking, and easy to get to.
Already have plans to go back again"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the staff was friendly and warm. We had an amazing pad Thai that tasted like tamarind and not ketchup. The coconut soup was tangy and full of chicken."}
{"text":"I came in today just for the Calamari. It's the best I ever tasted. The presentation is great. Comes with 3 sauces Sweet, Hot and Thai sauce. If you are looking for Authentic Thai Food, you must come here. It will definitely satisfy your pallette."}
{"text":"This is the second time my friend and I have come here and both times we really enjoyed the dishes we had. This time we started off with the Thai Curry Puffs. A little on the small side, but very tasty. For our mains we shared the glass noodle salad and the basil beef. Both dishes were delicious. Would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I placed an order for delivery, and was told that food would be delivered in half an hour. 
I called again after one hour and was told that food would be delivered in half an hour. When I complained, they cancelled the order.  
Order from this place at your own risk."}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant with very friendly service. Food takes a bit ti"}
{"text":"Delicious authentic Thai food and great service. They were very accommodating to our large party of 17 adults and 3 babies although the restaurant was small and we pretty much took up the whole space. It was everyone's first time here and no one had any complaints about their meals and everyone was pleased to know that this place existed! If only it wasn't a bit far from where we all lived. The curry wasn't overly sweet and I was pleased to see that there was no ketchup used to make the pad thai (the Phuket style pad Thai lists tamarind and fish sauce as ingredients which is so critical for me) although it could use a bit more of a kick (mild really IS mild). It was still pretty tasty and the portions were decent. Presentation was great!"}
{"text":"Won't order again. 
Spicy pad Thai was completely bland, I think they forgot the spices all together, no tastes of garlic, fish sauce or anything really. Its not the ketchup based sauces you get elsewhere but certainly not authentic either. We would have re ordered another dish had this not been delivery, it's currently sitting abandoned and untouched on the counter... No sauce for the spring rolls was provided and we received no cutlery."}
{"text":"Disliked the food here. Had the Phuket style pad thai and the soggy noodles were swimming in sugary sauce. It is supposed to be made with tamarind, then why is it orange? It should be brown. Also had the basil chicken stir fry. Why does it again have so much sauce? Not sure what the sauce was made out of. However, plentiful chicken and vegetables. 

I don't understand why this place has such high ratings. The service was okay, the dining area has a garage door, so it was cold the whole time. 

Also had the tom yum soup. It was a bit too salty but overall very flavourful."}
{"text":"I waited over an hour for my order and when I called them to check why it was taking so long the lady over the phone told me that the driver forgot to pick up my order by accident and to re order with UberEATS. What the actual f***"}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant. Server was fast and attentive. Food was great, my SO said it was pretty authentic based on his recent travels to Thailand. 

We ordered the Phuket Style Pad Thai, Tom Yum Soup and Mango Sticky Rice. 

The only thing that wasn't to my preference was the Thai Coffee, as it was too sweet. But I also know that the authentic Thai Coffee is supposed to be sweet, so this doesn't affect my rating."}
{"text":"Service was exceptional! After our meal, our waitress came by and asked if she could clear our table so we could be more comfortable, which I thought was soo accommodating!! She was an older lady but had the sincerest interest in our stay and I saw her conversing with some of the walk-ins and uber eats drivers with a huge smile, so you can tell she's very good at customer service and genuinely likes people! 

The food came out quickly as we were the only people in the restaurant on a Friday night, but the dishes were absolutely tasty and filling! When the young waiter asked if I wanted it spicy, I asked for it mild and they delivered! Everything was seriously A1! And their tea is served in little porcelain elephants, so you don't have to keep asking for refills. Also, their cutlery was very clean and shiny!! A definite plus

Will definitely come by again and recommend to any Thai cuisine lovers!"}
{"text":"Food -The quality of the food is greasy. I really wanted to like Siam Square. However everything I tasted either had too much sugar or too much grease. They need to do a menu overhaul. 

Ambiance-The inside was cute however Ventilation is poor , you dont want to go to a restaurant to smell like the food. I had to air out my jacket for a day after. 

Service -I will say they were short staffed so it was kinda slow. But they tried really hard to make up for it.

Parking - The plaza is always full so you may have to wait for a spot."}
{"text":"My cousin picked up Vegetarian Fresh Rolls from here for a family event and they were really good. The rolls were really fresh and the sauce that they came with was really good."}
{"text":"Oh dear. The one star is for the lovely staff and the crunchy mango salad. I wanted to try this restaurant because lots of reviewers said it was 'authentic'. The restaurant themselves call it 'authentic'. Oh boy... if this is authentic I suppose I don't like Thai Food.
My pad Thai was arguably the worst ever! It was so sweet that it sent me into sugar shock. I've never actually not finished a plate of pad Thai. If there had been some balance of flavour with more heat (which we asked for when we ordered) or lime or tamarind, it might have saved the dish. My friend!s noodles were bland as could be. Thai fresh rolls fell apart before we could eat them. 
Very disappointing. Not authentic.  Also, they don't have A/C, so if you like to dine in comfort, don't visit this place in the summer."}
{"text":"My favourite Thai place in Toronto! It's definitely a hidden gem - highly recommend! The owner just exudes warmth and passion and I've always had good service experiences here. The food is amazing - haven't encountered anything I didn't like yet! I had the mango salad, green curry chicken, and pad tHai.I feel like the flavours of this place is definitely a little bit different than other Thai places I have tried - but in a good way! Those curry puffs are the best - and I don't even like that kind of curry normally!"}
{"text":"Love the many Thai options around my neighbourhood. I was craving Thai food so I decided to use Uber Eats, came within 45 minutes. I ordered the mango salad and their special chicken wings with thai chili sauce. Both were delicious but if I had to choose, I'd still go with Jantujuk street thai food, there seems to be more flavour and authenticity in their food."}
{"text":"Me and my wife used to love this place, but in the last month it's gone to shit. I found a rock in my food on my last order and was very disappointed with their blatant lack of customer service when we called them to complain about rice missing from our curry order. 
If you're rea1ding this try a different place."}
{"text":"The coating of calamari as thick, salty, and partially burnt, looked like it was cooked in a rush.

Thai iced tea is full of syrup and artificial taste;

Two pad Thai were watery,

The curry was oily I didn't even try, according to DH, it was okay though.

We were the only customers ate in for almost 1 hour, which was supposed to be the busy dinner time.

The owner/lady was nice though."}
{"text":"Authentic Thai food is hard to come by. This place is definitely authentic! Food is amazing. Everything on the menu is delish!"}
{"text":"Siam Square Hut is an example of how you shouldn't judge a restaurant by its exterior. Siam Square Hut is tucked in a little corner plaza surrounded by a laundromat and a Subway. The outside of the restaurant is very unassuming. 

I was pleasantly surprised once I sat down and tried the food. We ordered several items on the menu - mango salad, cream cheese crab rangoon and satay chicken and tom yum soup as apps, and Thai chicken noodle soup and red curry as the mains. Everything was absolutely delicious! I almost fell into a food coma by the time I was done! 

The service was friendly and the pricing was not bad at all - our total was just over $50 before tip. Not bad for two people and six dishes! 

The only thing that I wasn't too thrilled about was the way that the satay was served. I get that some people like having sliced bread dipped in peanut sauce but to me, it would have been better if they served more satay or had the satay served on top of some naan. 

As a recommendation, I would definitely suggest getting the cream cheese crab rangoon and Thai chicken noodle soup as a main. You will leave feeling very full and satisfied!"}
{"text":"Between 2 people we ordered: 
Tom yum soup (chicken) - a little towards the sour side
Pad thai (shrimp) - a bit towards the sweet side
mango sticky rice - had a lot of rice and half a  mango for $7

All 3 for about $37 before tips. 

The service was great.
There is also a patio outside which would be really nice during summer."}
{"text":"Siam Square Hut is a hidden gem. By far one of my favourite Thai places to go to. Friendly staff and owner. The owner is originally from Thailand and gets super excited to educate us about Thai culinary all the time. 

Friends have told me, it's as close to Thailand as it can be. 

Had the Khao soi the past couple times I've been here and have yet to get bored of it. I said I will try other things here but I keep going back for the Khao soi."}
{"text":"The inside of this resto is fancy af, with affordable prices and even lunch specials (until 14:30). I highly suggest that you try the mango salad; the mangos are sweet, yet crunchy and STILL manages to be juicy. I also liked the spring rolls here as they were crispy, but not too oily. However, I thought that the pad thai was average and didn't have as much meat portion as I had hoped for. The fried rice is good too, if you're not a noodz type of person. My friends looooved the calamari, but suggest that you eat it right away (and not for takeout because it gets soggy realllll quick)."}
{"text":"Tried this through DoorDash delivery. The food came super quick and was so delicious. 

Definitely one of the best Thai in the city. 

Try the Shrimp in Golden Thread - super delicious!"}
{"text":"Delicious and authentic!! Customer service was amazing and we chomped through everything! 

Green curry was perfect - creamy, complex, a little spicy with peanut flavour, with a good amount of veggies and meat.  The bamboo shoots were delicious and fresh; no canned shoots here!

Shrimp pad thai was not bad... shrimp was perfectly cooked and their portions were good. Maybe I'll get it spicy next time. 

Shrimp chips had a nice slight kick to it but it was the peanut sauce that really made the dish.

Calamari was nicely seasoned and was lightly breaded.

Curry puffs (2 for $5) were delightful - crispy on the outside, soft and yummy with a perfect balance of salty and sweet on the inside. Wish it came with at least 3 for the size/price.

Crab Fried rice uses strips of crab meat and was flavourful with crunchy cashews to complement the dish.

Mango and sticky rice was delightful! Creamy and not too sweet balancing the sweetness and sourness of the mango.  

Definitely recommend and definitely will come back!!"}
{"text":"Great Thai noodles and great service at an excellent price. What more could you ask for? 

Had the Siam Square Hut Noodles in chicken and that made me so happy. The noodles had great texture and the taste was phenomenal. It was like being transported to Thailand and having a great meal. This is some seriously good Thai food.

Try them out!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner tonight on the recommendation of a friend who has eaten here a few times previously. Was not at all disappointed. Great food! Nice atmosphere. Fairly priced (i.e. $100 for four people--everyone left completely full). Will return soon. Thanks Siam Square Hut!"}
{"text":"We had a DoorDash coupon, so the time was right to finally try Siam Square Hut. (The DoorDash experience was horrendous, but that's a story for a different review.)

I opted for the Phuket-Style Pad Thai (\"stir fried Thai rice noodles, tamarind, egg, tofu, bean sprout, pickled radish, shallot, chives, dried shrimp, fish sauce & ground roasted peanuts\") and asked for the dish extra spicy.

Before I get into the food itself, I've got to commend Siam Square Hut for coming through on the spice. Whenever I order a dish like this, I *always* ask for extra spicy but what I get is usually akin to a mild, barely-noticeable kiss of spice. This dish, on the other hand, contained a level of heat that left me reeling on a consistent basis. It was fantastic.

The food itself was above average but still nothing to get terribly excited about. Everything was prepared well, but I felt like the dish should've held more flavors, particularly given its \"Phuket-Style\" origins.

I'm definitely excited to try more of Siam Square Hut's offerings, although I'll never use DoorDash for delivery ever again."}
{"text":"Not that great, their garlic chicken is quite bland, actually very bland. The pad see eew is far from authentic. The fried rice was good though."}
{"text":"This is a tiny restaurant that does mostly a takeout and delivery business, but we've eaten in twice as we are a bit from them.

Excellent Thai food, nicely seasoned and not loaded with too much sugar like so many Thai restaurants.  Very generous portions.  Tom Kha and Tom Yum soups were both excellent as were the curry and noodle dishes.  Tasty vegetable fresh rolls too.  Very reasonable prices.  Capable service.  Only slight complaint is that beef is a bit chewy."}
{"text":"Delicious flavours, filling portions, friendly service, and super reasonable prices here. There's not much to critique here!

I came here for dinner in a group, and my colleagues really enjoyed their meals - from curry puffs, to Massamun curry, to peanut stir-fry. I ordered two appetizers, vegetarian fresh rolls and shrimp chips, and was really pleased with both as well. With a (non-alcoholic) drink, my bill came to under $20... for a lovely, sit-down dinner! How is that even possible?

They also get bonus points for serving my ginger tea in a super cute elephant teapot that we all gushed over."}
{"text":"Delicious tasty food! I love their salads and soups! A bit pricey for the quantity served though. 
They should offer different sizes and prices for their dishes."}
{"text":"Very fresh and very authentic. Without having to travel downtown this spot hits it right. Fast, clean and Thai authentic (no ketchup in your pad Thai) I really recommend this place. I usually go downtown for my 5 star Thai food, however this place does the trick in the Leaside/Sunnybrook area."}
{"text":"Not sure what happened to Siam Hut, but on my last visit food was just bad. Green curry was super sweet and came with huge chunks of raw broccoli and green peppers. As someone mentioned before, the restaurant was dirty, from the floors up  every surface seemed to be covered in sticky residue."}
{"text":"You'd never know it was there until you walked up to it but it's pretty good legit Thai food cooked by Thai people (I think). 

Mango salad is fresh and tasty and big enough to share. We got that a curry and a house special noodle which was plenty to share. Between two people. 

No real complaints. Service was fast and friendly they don't gouge you on the soft drinks and it's fairly quiet there you can always get a table. 

I heard it's going to stay despite the construction in that plaza. Hope it works out for them.


Update June 2018. Came for dinner the other day and noticed they are using teflon coated cookware. Not a good idea folks. You have a commercial gas burner which is way too hot for teflon. That smell that you smell? Its not lemongrass, basil and fish sauce. Its burning teflon! Knocked a star off for that and im not sure i will be back until i hear you went back to the old school wok."}
{"text":"This place has to be one of the  best Thai food spots I have ever tried in Toronto. It's a small tucked-in-the corner spot but the quality level and the staff seem bigger than that. I had the Siam Square hut noodles with chicken and I almost ordered a second one to take home. Living minutes from this place I am not going to be looking for a new Thai place. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great customer service and good atmosphere. Patios nice but they could have done better seating arrangements to get more use out of it. The food was average. The green curry was excellent with the jasmine rice, but the pad thai was alittle lacking. Being one of the closer thai restaurants in the area im still pleasantly surprised and will be going back often!"}
{"text":"I have ordered from Siam Square Hut twice.  

Both times, it has been so freshly made.  What's supposed to be crispy is crispy.  

I really appreciate it.   This is now a go-to for me.

UPDATE: Use Uber only.  DO NOT use their delivery service.  Unless you want to wait 1.5 hours for your food.  Use Uber and pay the 5 bucks."}
{"text":"The restaurant is located in a shopping plaza so there's free parking spots right in front. There's several TTC buses on Eglinton and one on Bayview that will drop you off. Just keep in mind that there's a lot of construction due to the new Eglinton LRT Metrolinx so there's a lot more traffic, the sidewalk gets randomly shutdown, and the bus stops get moved around a lot. They have a patio in the front and the front door and bathroom are accessible.

The Thai food here is the best I've ever had.
It's well made with great ingredients. My friend 's been to Thailand and says it's the best Thai food she's had since her trip. The only problem I have with the food is that they don't offer crispy beef, my fav. My other general problem is the terrible delivery service. Another friend of mine had to wait 2hrs for her delivery and we're only a 10-15 walk away. The food is so good, though, I'm willing to just call ahead and pick up my food."}
{"text":"My friend and I got delivery and the food was good! I ordered a green curry with their spiciest level and honestly, it was the first restaurant that delivered on the spice level. The green curry itself was tasty but definitely not something to write about"}
{"text":"First impression when i went to this place was why does this place look dirty? door and storefront glass were so dirty it hasn't been clean in a while, we looked at the menu that was taped and saw a died fly. We sat at the table next to the store front and froze , menus were sticky, we ordered at 6:30  got water at 7:00 got food at 8:00... service was very very very slow , it was on a Saturday, there was one cook no helper.. the waitress didn't speak english well so if we asked him something he hardly understood. He didn't know how to serve the plates so we picked up our plates from the tray he held fearing he would drop it on us.. we moved to a different table because we froze. That table had a glasstop  with a huge big crack that was taped , and he cleaned the table with a tissue by picking the crumbs didn't even wipe it or anything. Food was 7/10 not the greatest.. after spending 2.5 hours there to have a meal in a place that was not packed.. we left the place smelling like fried food i guess they didn't have ventilation in this place because the smell of cooking food was in our cloths.."}
{"text":"I noticed this place for a while, and finally came in to try the food . Wow, delicious. The flavours are amazing! Great find, I have now been coming for a year for their delicious Thai food, it always makes my taste buds sing.

Easy to get to at Bayview and Eglinton in the Little mall with the Rexall pharmacy closest to the subways. The owner and everyone is very nice. They make sure you are ordering the right heat. Remember Thailand loves spice hot!! We think we can take it. LoL... Better to work your way up to the heat you can handle. 

Enjoy.!"}
{"text":"I was here for lunch.  They have a small lunch menu with prices ranging around $9-12. I got the beef noodle soup ($9). It was very good, with rich flavour. It reminded me a little of a Vietnamese soup. The beef itself was a little tough. The dish was not very large. It came with a side of spring roll. The place is nice and clean with an open kitchen that's well organized."}
{"text":"This is a new Thai restaurant in midtown Toronto. I stumbled across this restaurant on the first week it opened.  I have been here a total of 4 times, and it has been a great experience on all 4 occasions.  The dishes are flavorful, each dish comes with its own distinct taste. Out of everything, the Tom Yum soup is a must, the taste is truly authentic. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"What a delightful little restaurant, set near midtown Toronto. I came here on the recommendation of a cousin, and ordered take out twice before sitting-in recently for a meal with my family. The food is delicious, definitely some of the best Thai food you can get in the city. The Mango salad is delicious and full of peanuts, the pad thai isn't oily, greasy or \"ketchupy\" like you find in some places, the pineapple friend rice is fluffy and full of flavour, and in my opinion, best of all is the green curry - which is a thick, flavourful sauce with chicken (or your choice of meat) and veggies, including squash. Yum!

The food does come out a bit slowly, but I could tell it's because they are actually cooking it in the back - unlike some places, where the food suspiciously comes out all at the same time and very quickly. Prices are very decent and service was great. 

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Siam Square Hut's lunch special. Quit a decent choice if you are in the area and craving for some Thai food.

Basil Chicken with Rice ($10) comes with either Tom Yum Soup or Spring Roll: Really healthy option as it comes with a lot of vegetables. Tasted homemade, I guess that is good?

Thai Curry Puff (2/$5) reminds me of the ones I had at Patchmon's https://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/patchmons-thai-desserts-and-more-toronto?select=UsxpjgbuB-FrYxJaxjVSAg I guess this is good?

Service is friendly and homey. Awesome Thai hospitality."}
{"text":"Very good and authentic thai food.  I have tried the phuket style pad thai, def a must try.  The chicken cake is very flavourful and the mango salad is very refreshing too.  The Mango sticky rice is a but disappointing thou, not enough mango and the rice is not sticky enough.  But other than that I would def come back to try other dishes"}
{"text":"Finally found a place that cooks legit Thai food!  Not every day you can find good ton yum kung in Toronto! I was in Thailand beginning of this year and this place got the same taste! Highly recommend, reasonable price. On the side note must try the mango sticky rice"}
{"text":"One of the best Thai places I've been to. Friendly staff, fresh ingredients, delicious apps and mains. 

Started with the mango salad, so fresh and crispy with just the right amount of dressing. Then we moved on to the spring rolls, crispy crunch and completely filled with carrots and crunchy cabbage - delicious.

I will never forget the special app they have called the curry puffs, sort of a cross between a samosa and yellow Thai curry. I could totally just order curry puffs and be happy. Which I might do one day.

For our mains we got the green curry, siam square hut curry, and of course pad thai! We had chicken as the meat for everything and had medium spicy( I love that you can choose how spicy you want your dish!) 

The green curry was good - I'm not a big fan of green curry to start, it was for my girl friend. She said it was good and flavourful with a nice portion of meat and sauce. The siam square hut curry was amazing, it's a golden curry base with amazing flavour and lots of meat. It was probably some of the best I've had. Then there was their amazing pad thai, which in my opinion the best I've ever had. I normally don't like the over powering sweetness of other pad thai with a hint of ketchup taste. None of that here! It was well balanced and you could tell they made the sauce themselves- it was not the bright red I was expecting but a more natural looking colour which to me meant homemade. 

The location itself is delightful little place on Ellington. It is however, unfortunately in a whirl wind of construction right now, but believe me, it is well worth going!"}
