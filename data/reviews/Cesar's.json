{"text":"Server was very kind and accommodating. Restaurant is quaint and has friendly vibe. Food was delicious."}
{"text":"It was a good restaurant, but I think the food could be of a bit better quality, and the waiters could be a bit more friendly and welcoming. Overall, I had a mediocre experience at Cesar's restaurant."}
{"text":"Service was terrible! We were very polite and told them the pasta very dry and missing ingredients, the owner told us we had never eaten a good meal in our life,
And he kicked us out!!!"}
{"text":"I was walking around vieux-port and suddenly got really hungry. I turn my head and see this place. It looks friendly and inviting. A lot of green, so probably healthy, right? I take a look at the menu and it looks great! Quiche, sandwiches, soups, salads, lots of great stuff! Oh and lots of desserts! 

We go in and we were immediately greeted by a smiling waiter. He let up pick the seats we wanted and brought the menus over. Actually, the menus are on the placemats. I thought it was pretty cheap! 

I got a huge piece of onion quiche (1/4 of a humongous quiche) as well as a Mille feuilles made with beets and goat cheese with herbs. 

The food took quite some time to come out (in their d√©fense, it was 2pm, so maybe te kitchen wasn't ready?), but it smelled SO GOOD! The quiche (12$) was nice and hot and the Mille feuilles (6$) looked delicious. 

I dived into the Mille feuilles first. Oh my gosh! It was totally worth the wait!! The ingredients were so simple, but somehow when they were combined, it was just an explosion of deliciousness! You have to get it! You must! 

After the mind blowing that the Mille feuilles has done, the quiche wasn't has amazing, but it was still delicious! I was so full after finishing it!  

They also had some huge meringues that I would've wanted to try, but I was way too full. 

All in all, super delicious food, but I have to remove one star because of the wait."}
