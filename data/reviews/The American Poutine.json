{"text":"Its great when you just stumble across somewhere to eat by complete chance, to discover scumptious food. I was riding my bike along central avenue in Phoenix, saw the truck and ordered the buffollo chicken over fries. I could not tell you anything about Poutine cuisine, but what I had was delicious highly recommend."}
{"text":"***FOOD TRUCK***  Check their Facebook page to see where they will be. It seems like they're very organized with their future destinations!   Absolutely Amazing!!!! Potato-Pork-Cheese Heaven on Wheels! The Fries are as fresh as fresh could be! Perfect! BBQ Pork and Bacon delicious!  Gravy had great flavor! NOT too salty! And the Cheese spectacular!!! I'd say my friends from Canada would be proud of what you serve!!! The service was fantastic as well! They were at the BBQ-Beer Festival in Chandler, and the place was absolutely packed, but these PROs moved through a line of people very QUICK!!!  I am going to have to catch up with you on the road one of these days!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered the Porker Poutine during a food truck festival and it was great! If anything, I wished that the food had been hotter as my cheese curds weren't as melty as I would have liked. I really liked the pulled pork, although it was just a bit too sweet; just a little bit."}
{"text":"Having tried my first poutine in montreal home of the poutine, i knew i had high standards coming in. I was pleasantly surprised:) i walked up to truck i was greeted by a super cute cashier and the chef who recognized me from my facebook post! I waited about a minute and was presented with a bowl of heaven. The curds werent too big or too small so they melted perfectly the fries had a greAt texture not to get too soggy or too crunchy and the poutine sauce itself was just perfect. The chef came out to ask me how they stacked up to montreal which i thought was cool. I had an awesome expirience there and i hope u find this review helpful in making the choice to eat here. When youre in the mood for poutine nothing else will cut it..."}
{"text":"My first experience with poutine and it did not disappoint.  I'm hooked.  The cheese curds stay squeaky,  the gravy is good,  throw some bacon on that beast and you're set.  We stop at this food truck anytime we make it to the QC food truck Friday."}
{"text":"If you walk by this location it seems inviting but you open the door and it smell like ass.  I wonder what or how they clean the oil for the fries but yuk!!!! I guess this explains why it is never busy!!!"}
{"text":"Good food. We ordered the original. We've had Poutine in Quebec and Alberta. This was a pretty good copy. Gravy was fantastic. Fries and cheese were good. I think my kids would love these deluxe fries. Store was kinda slow. Not many people, so I'm worried. Grub hub picked up an order while we ate. I'll go back again."}
{"text":"Good not great...  To start, the address that is listed on Yelp is incorrect. When I finally found the place and asked the guy working what was up, he didn't seem too worried about it nor did he seem to even care that we came in. That same enthusiasm (or lack thereof) was echoed in the rest of the service and food. The shop itself was nice and clean but the food menu wasn't posted anywhere so you have to stand awkwardly reading a piece of paper while trying to figure out what you want. I guess I should have planned my order ahead of time to make it more convenient.   On to the food-I ordered the Pork Poutine to go and to be perfectly honest, the flavors just all melded together into a less than flavorful mess. One of my favorite parts of any routine is a delicious gravy and fresh cheese curds. The fries were fresh, the cheese was delicious, but the gravy....The gravy tasted like a powdered mix which was disappointing because a good gravy can be the star of an otherwise drab poutine. The pork on the poutine was really good, but I would like a little kick to top it off! Overall, the food was good but not great. However, if you're looking for a good value, you get a ton of food for your money!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Generous portions. Gotta try the porker! Their BBQ shredded pork is incredible and with perfect bacon = heaven. Their brick and mortar store in Gilbert open now! Not just food trucks anymore. Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Wasn't a fan of this place; went to the one in Gilbert/Chandler area w my mom and sister.  I had really talked up poutine and how much they would love it.  Unfortunately, it wasn't a great start.  There weren't a lot of options but I ordered a regular version which had fries, cheddar (I think), brown gravy.  It was good but served in a cup which made it less convenient to eat.  Mom and sis both got the pizza version.  It was pretty bad, I'm sad to say.  Very salty and just not at all like what you expect to get w a poutine.  Needless to say, I'll have a hard time convincing them to try again.  Sodas in a can, small tv in dining area, which is also small.  Very clean; prompt service"}
{"text":"My son really liked the clam chowder poutine, my husband thought the gravy was super salty and my daughter got the cheeseburger poutine. I got the veggie.  If you detest nacho sauce as I do then this is not the place for you. I asked if the sauce was real cheese or the velvita crap,  the guy behind the counter could not grasp what I meant. Not impressed, like another reviewer said \"not understanding why all the fuss\" I could make it better at home. I would say give it a try but don't expect much except a large portion."}
{"text":"I had just gotten done hiking in the supes and was headed back home when I had a huge craving for some bomb fries and fizzy drink (I don't like soda but at the time I was craving it). I drove to the restaurant and thought the entry way was cute (theirs fries on the floor that says \"follow me\"... and it leads you to the front register! So cheesy but I like the simple decor and feel inside. The menu was pretty simple, I picked the buffalo chicken fries! The wait felt awhile because it was just one guy (mind you I'm there on a Tuesday afternoon around 4pm) working. I finally get my order and drink! The smell was amazing, there was drizzle of sauce and some cheese curd and chicken on fries, must I say more? I was unsure if this would fill me up but half way digging in, I got into a food coma. The chicken was delicious and the outside of it had a nice crunch. The buffalo sauce was not over bearing and did not have that strong vinegar smell/taste. It was just right.   My first experience here was excellent, I told all my friends about it and I can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu. I wish I had seen the $2 off check in deal on yelp but either way it was worth it for what I paid. Delicious, fresh, and hit the hungry hikers spot!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place since they have opened and finally made it with with my little sidekick. OMG!!! I'm so glad I finally made the top. I love fries and all toppings. We had the chili cheese fries deluxe and it was ALOT AND SOO GOOD. Definitely coming back. Maybe once a week (or more!) to try all of them. ....  not to mention the owner is super nice and friendly! Always love a business who appreciates their customers! You can tell he has a love and passion for culinary."}
{"text":"This place is neither good nor bad. My first thought when I walked in was \"this is an awesome speciality restaurant\". As I spent more time inside I started to notice a few things; the room doesn't flow and the atmosphere needs some work.  Now let's talk food because let's be honest that's the reason you wanna go here. First, if you don't know what poutine is that's okay because I didn't either.   POUTINE is a dish of French fries topped with cheese curds and gravy.  The prices are a little high for a box of fries. I was able to try the Philly cheese steak fries, Buffalo chick fries, pizza fries and the bacon poutine. All of which I thought were average, whether it was too much sauce, too much cheese or too much gravy the flavors were not proportional and the fries were soggy. Now if you love soggy fries than this probably isn't an issue for you, but I prefer crispy fries.   All in all I'm glad I tried it. Although I don't think I'll be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Word of advise, please, have Yelp adjust where you are on their map, this fantastic little gem is located on Val Vista and Warner Rd, not Greenfield and Warner Rd.  That being said, this place is gonna get me and my wife in trouble.... Just like I remember, from the food truck!!! I had my tried and true bacon poutine, while the wife got the buffalo chicken fries. I absolutely loved mine, hers had too much buffalo sauce, so at the bottom, it was all sauce, not what she wanted. It's ok though, just learned something about this place, and she knows to try something else next time. Me, I'm gonna stick with the bacon, because when you have fries, gravy, cheese curds, AND bacon, how can you go wrong?"}
{"text":"I used to live in Atlantic Canada and grew to appreciate poutine there. I've been in Phoenix for 5 years hunting for poutine, and this food truck makes the best poutine I've had in North America!"}
{"text":"Came in with the family for poutine. Ordered chili fries, buffalo fries, original poutine and the chicken tenders/fries box for the kids.   I asked the girl working how big the chicken order was and was told it was 4 strips and lots of fries. The menu says \"juicy, breaded, 100% chicken\". The order came out with 4 dried up tiny little nuggets.   I checked to see if we got the wrong order and was told that they didn't have the strips and are substituting the nuggets. Not sure why this info wasn't given up front. 1 strip would probably equal all 4 of these nuggets. And they definitely weren't juicy 100% chicken.   Had to go to Del Taco after to fill the kids up."}
{"text":"Tried American Poutine with a Groupon.  I am sure others will really like it but I just did not care for it.  I thought the fries were to greasy for my taste although the meat was fine but unfortunately I will not be returning."}
{"text":"The staff was great. Very nice and polite and helpful. At first it seemed like the portion sizes we're going to be too small. My wife got the original I got the bacon cheeseburger then we got a third one The fried chicken one just to try something different. As I said it didn't seem like there was gonna be enough food so the third one was it just in case order. Man was I wrong. My wife and I could've probably just shared one original and been fine. So with that being said we left with a bunch of leftovers. Great place unique concept fun to try for sure would recommend anyone."}
{"text":"Well, I went there on a Groupon, so my expectations weren't terribly high to begin with. We ordered a traditional poutine and a buffalo chicken poutine. Now, if we hadn't had a Groupon offer, I would have left after seeing the prices. At least $10 per item, and it's a fairly small box of fries, curds and gravy. Maybe I'm cheap, but that's not worth the price for me.  Moving on, the little restaurant had potential to be very cute and welcoming, but actually smelled vaguely of dirty mop water, and there was dirt and grime in a lot of the corners. Now, I might be more critical of these things because I am a manager in food service, but it left me feeling a little bit dirty.  Onto the food, after getting the little box of fries, gravy and curds, I found it lacking. Maybe my taste buds wanted more salt, and more crunch on the fries. And the buffalo sauce the chicken was swimming in was just a little bit overwhelming.  It wanted to be delicious, it just wasn't there yet.   I feel like The American Poutine has potential to be a great little restaurant, but just didn't quite hit the mark."}
{"text":"I got the Bacon Poutine and was not disappointed. I've never had these before and everything about it was great. I've heard authentic cheese curbs have the squeak, and these have the squeak! So delicious. I would have not thought of combining these ingredients together, but what a mashup. YUM!"}
{"text":"Wonderful fries and services.  Came here with a craving for fries with plenty of fixings... And jackpot. Fries that are freshly cooked our out of this world!  Owner was incredibly nice and informative.  Next time I'm in Gilbert or spot an American Pouting truck I'll be buyin!   Thank you!!  Your newest fan!!"}
{"text":"Since U.S. Fries closed, I've needed a place to get my poutine fix. This place is close to my sister's house, so we stopped in to get lunch after shopping. It's not really kid-friendly. Normally, I wouldn't even think about that, but my sister has a 3-year-old and they had no highchairs and all their tables are hightops, except for one small two-top in the corner (also not prime for accessibility for people who use wheelchairs). We took our food to go.   I ordered a fried chicken poutine, and my sister got a pulled pork. We both liked our food. The cheese curds were totally melted by the time we got home, so you may want to eat in. The fries were quite crispy and brown, which I prefer, but they might've been overdone for some people.  They had a lot of delicious options. I was torn between the fried chicken and the buffalo chicken or the bacon cheeseburger. Not all the offerings have gravy, so if you're not a fan of traditional poutine but you likes fries, you can still probably find something you'll like."}
{"text":"Awesome Fries!!!!  I went with the Jacob's (employee) suggestion:  Buffalo Chicken with cheese curds...delicious.  Ryan (another employee) suggested the bacon cheeseburger fry for my picky daughter and she loved it.  The portions definitely feed 2.  So you can have left overs!  Great, friendly staff!  Very unique god and very filling."}
{"text":"Love the original. I also ordered the pulled port bacon and it was ok. Too sweet for my wife's taste. Needed more fries in it. A little pricey for what you get but I will come back for the original and maybe try the bacon next time."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this food truck! The portions are huge so you definitely get your money's worth. The Buffalo Chicken Poutine was great, but the classic really took it home for me. The gravy was well seasoned. My only recommendation would be to warm up the cheese curds a tad, as they were so cold that they cooled down the rest of the dish quickly."}
{"text":"This review is for the food truck (though I've been wanting to visit The American Poutine restaurant in Gilbert for a while). I was super excited to see The American Poutine food truck at an event I was at -- so, of course, I had to order. Unfortunately, it was not a great experience. The wait for food was long (over 15 mins), orders after mine came out before mine, and they had no water to purchase. Then, when I received my order I noticed something off -- the blue cheese drizzle was missing so I had to go back and ask them to add it on top (what I received tasted like ranch though). Throughout the whole thing the staff in the truck wasn't the friendliest. For $12 out of pocket, I regret having made the Buffalo Chicken Fries my choice for lunch that day. And because I ordered at the food truck I wasn't able to check-in and use the $2 off Yelp deal. Money not well spent and this experience has left me with real lack of desire to visit the restaurant when I was so eager to visit before."}
{"text":"I spent over $12 on Buffalo Fries. They are drenched in Buffalo sauce to the point they aren't even edible. I tried soaking up some of the Buffalo sauce with paper towels but the fries are ruined. I will not be going back here. Waste of money. I was really excited about trying this place, but I'm very disappointed."}
{"text":"I had the kind with cheese sauce and bacon and it was pretty good. Staff was also extremely friendly. I know that poutine is hugely popular in some places but it seems weird to me that people would eat this as a whole meal. I could only eat half of it.  I wish they would offer smaller portions at a cheaper price. I'd like to try some of the other flavor options, like the more traditional gravy and cheese curd one, but I don't really want to pay $10+ for a huge order of fries with toppings. \"brown gravy\" doesn't sound very appealing to me at all but I'd still like to try it, if I could get a smaller portion of it."}
{"text":"I'm Canadian.   I love fries and gravy! I love poutine! I love fries, gravy & cheese curd!  The first time I tried The American Poutine Co was at a food truck festival and I will admit, I wasn't impressed. Fast forward a few years, I find them on a food delivery site and decide to try them again. I'm hooked.   Is it the best poutine I've ever had? The French side of my family would be wildly disappointed. However, they're The American rendition and I must keep that in mind.   A few things, the gravy never gets as piping hot as it did in my childhood memories, when it's so hot that upon ladeling it over the curds it just melts. I've frequented the trucks now and it's always squeaky cheese curd. Ordering delivery however, gives the element it requires. By the time it's at the door the cheese has melted perfectly creating a dish to make the mouth water.   I haven't tried their multiple options available personally, because my father would tell me it isn't poutine. Although, the other eaters in the house have had the works, pulled pork, garlic fries and Philly cheesesteak with no complaints.  It's disgusting the quantity of original poutine I can eat from this establishment and probably best I keep it to delivery to avoid the looks of horror. How I like to spice it up is with some malt vinegar, ketchup and ground pepper.   So long as this place is serving up poutine, I'll be eating it. Glad it finally came to my door step to offer an entirely different experience as opposed to catching them at the food truck stops. I suppose it might be worth checking the actual place out but for now, home is where the heart is.   Thank you for supplying me with new memories of a childhood staple."}
{"text":"This food truck is awesome!! Pou·tine (Noun): Canadian delicacy consisting of french fries covered in gravy and cheese curds.  I was already sold by that definition alone, but American Poutine Co. took it up a notch.  Everything on their menu sounded delicious.  I showed some self-restraint by not ordering one of everything on the menu and went with the Porker Poutine.  To start, they don't use fries straight from your grocer's freezer.  They use quality fresh-cut hearty potatoes for the base of the dish.  They certainly did not skimp on the pulled pork which was super smoky or the thick and crispy bacon.  All of that was slathered in gravy and sprinkled with cheese curds.  An explosion of deliciousness in each and every bite.  The American Poutine Co. has to be one of my top 3 favorite food trucks in the Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"I initially tried this place from a food truck. At that time I ordered the gyro poutine. It was really good!! Therefore, when an actual place opened up near me I had to try it. The serving sizes are huge! I got the phillycheesesteak poutine. They are quite generous with the toppings. Unfortunately they didn't have the one I ordered before... They should add it. I wanna try the original next. This is like perfect \"sober up\" post drinking food."}
{"text":"Just ate here for the first time. I ordered the bacon poutine. Literally the worst meal I've had all year. The staff looked stoned, and the music was incredible loud! Burnt fries covered in under cooked bacon, drowned in nasty brown gravy! Didn't finish the meal, threw it straight in the trash!  What a waste! Also the tables looked to be coated in 50 coats of varnish, the entire place reeked so bad it gave my wife a headache after five mins. Save yourself the headache, go eat elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Great food truck.....the fries are wonderful, the portions are huge & so filling.  Had the Buffalo Chicken style poutine, first time ever trying cheese curds.  It was delicious!  Hope I run into them again so I can try something else....so hard to choose with such a great menu & all it all sounds so good."}
{"text":"The service was horrible the man serving me didnt even give me what i ordered. When i tried to tell him it was wrong he denyed me and kept saying i was wrong. The cheese was still cold and the french fries were soggyand cold. They drowned everything in gravy. Over all i didnt get my money back. Didnt get what i ordered. And ended up with a stomach ache an hour later."}
{"text":"Food is good!!   They were swamped, understaffed and were working hard. The 2 young people working took care of the to-go orders before they sent out the people waiting. They were apologetic, but it took over 25min for fries.....! If we hadn't had a coupon-we wouldn't have stayed!! If you put out a coupon, plz staff accordingly!!"}
{"text":"First review for this delicious food truck!    I'm a recent poutine lover turned connoisseur.  Wherever they serve poutine, I try it.  Four Peaks Brewery?  Done.  Burger King at Vancouver International Airport?  Yup.  French Fries are, frankly, just better smothered in gravy and cheese curds!   I noticed this food truck at Country Thunder 2015 in Florence, Arizona, and it was calling out to me.  I went with the original, and was certainly not dissapointed!  I will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Yet again I have found another hidden gem in this food truck. I will say I stepped out of my comfort zone trying this place because I'd never had Poutine not was I really sure what it was. Yeah yeah lame right? After talking with the women taking orders and asking some questions I decided on the Buffalo Chicken Poutine. Really great flavor with just enough kick to it. I couldn't finish the entire thing because it was such a huge portion so I shared with a coworker. Goes to show trying new things can be very tasty."}
{"text":"I don't know what everybody's raving about. It's not that good. Mine was a big bowl of wet goop. For the three of us and no drinks it was $30, what a rip for some potatoes and gravy. The portions are huge though, The three of us could've split one order. I tried it once, I won't go back."}
{"text":"I stumbled on this gem after getting my nails done.  (See review on Kelly's for more details).  My daughter being the lover of everything potato she is, I knew I had to save this as a special treat one afternoon.  Today was that day, and they did not disappoint!!  We ordered the bacon cheese burger and all time favorite chili cheese and while we (family of 4) could have shared one, we stuffed ourselves with both delicious and generous helpings of greasy goodness!!  Service was friendly, restrooms and dinning area clean.  The container is designed to open up so the toppings can be spread over the fries conveniently and they are made for sharing!! Truly enjoyed!!"}
{"text":"SO good, SO filling, SO awesome! Can't say much more than that. I got the veggie works and I was left completely satisfied!"}
{"text":"\"The poutine here is really good\" -my Canadian friend   Poutine rookie here, gravy and fries were good. Mozzarella cheese curds also amazing (really when are cheese curds not amazing). Offered different options, classic is always a safe bet"}
{"text":"The food is simple, yet delicious. The establishment looked and felt clean and the man taking my order was also the one cooking it and he took care of the whole process professionally and efficiently. I recommend this place for sure"}
{"text":"I am from Canada and missing home so we thought we would try this. And it is good, glad there is actually cheese curds, and good gravy, my only thing is, the fries are a little bit over cooked. Good overall and a lot too choose from. The restaurant itself looks very good and I like the way it is set up, the staff is friendly as well."}
{"text":"Yum! Great variety and unique combinations. The fried are nice and crispy, the gravy is flavorful without being too salty, and the curds are the best we've ever had--soft, melty and tasty. The fried chicken poutine was the winner of the night! The chicken was perfectly fried and crisp. Having some beer in tap would make this absolutley fabulous."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place for a while. Nice location, small place. Limited seating but very clean. First thing you will notice on the menu was that it is very overpriced. I went with the traditional and it was $9. I can usually get a whole meal at lunch for $9. Like a sandwich, chips and drink.  Drinks were limited, only a few cans of soda and water.  My order came, and it was a mix of bland taste and temperature. The fried tasted burnt, I'm not sure if that was the way they are supposed to be served. But I felt like it was cooked in old oil. I thought the gravy was supposed to be hot enuf to melt the cheese curds, but my curds were still cold and solid. Gravy was fine, but nothing special. Serving was large, and I didn't finish half of it.  Mostly because I couldn't swallow any more of the burnt fries. I would suggest serving half the size orders for half the price.  I left feeling like I just wasted $11 on lunch. Owner was friendly, I didn't have the heart to tell him it was terrible.  It was lunch time and there were very few people there. I don't think this place will make it,  would be much better suited as a food truck."}
{"text":"Went here the other week. Very clean, small  eatery. Not many places to sit inside but the dishes are easy to eat and don't take very long. You're most likely not going to spend an hour eating. There are plenty of open areas outside as well. We sat outside on the wall because it was pretty busy. I was impressed with the many options they had on the menu. Unfortunately there were not many vegetarian options. We got the loaded veggie and the pizza without pepperoni. The loaded veggie was pretty simple but very tasty. Would get again. My friend and I were a little unimpressed with the pizza as it was mainly sauce in the dish. Would probably try the dessert poutine next time instead of another entree. The food was delivered very quickly but there was only one guy working. He seemed pretty stressed out and not very happy to be there (I probably would have not been either being the cashier, cleaner, cook and everyone else). He just kind of grunted at us and kind of made us feel unwelcome in his gestures. I am sure he was just stressed out but we were a little put off by it where we were more than happy to not eat inside. Maybe would go again if I am craving poutine or comfort food. It was pretty good just a little limited and I guess you really don't go there for a chat with the cashier/cook so... maybe would go back?"}
{"text":"As a transplanted Canadian I'm picky about poutine. I got the bacon one and it was really good. The bacon was fresh and the fries were flavorful. A little over cooked but still good. The gravy was a brown style and tasted great. The portion size was generous and overall I really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"This was a very nice time. I enjoyed the service and the staff  Was amazing. I went late afternoon which was nice, cause it was quite and a quit warm environment. I'd recommend this place to all my friends. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"So good! We made the drive from Tempe and were so happy we did. We had the original (cuz duh), the Philly cheesesteak, and the works. Everyone of them was awesome."}
{"text":"My first experience with pouting...and it was awesome.  Visiting food truck festivals is always fun, but sometimes it's hit-or-miss.  American Poutine Co. was a hit.  I had the Buffalo Chicken Fries.  Great hot sauce, tender chicken, creamy blue cheese dressing and yummy fries.  I am a buffalo chicken junkie and this dish did not disappoint.  I can't wait til they come back to Gilbert so I can try another poutine."}
{"text":"I went to the location given to me by Groupon and could not find a truck or storefront.   No idea what I am supposed to do with a Groupon that I cannot redeem."}
