{"text":"I come here frequently for lunch, as I work less than a block away.  The food is not gourmet, but it's really cheap and they give large portions.

A 'bowl' (which is actually a huge takeout box with a huge serving of rice) of BBQ Pork costs $4.50.  Duck is $5.20, and 2 types of BBQ meat is $5.50.

There are also some amazing lunch specials:
- Pan Fried Rice Noodle with Beef and Bean Sprout ($6.75)
- SIngapore or Malaysian Style Noodles ($6.75)
- Szechuan Shrimps on Rice ($6.50)
- Szechuan Shrimps on RIce ($6.50)

With that said, do not order from just-eat.ca - the prices get raised around 40-50% for the same meal!

Also, while they do some dishes well, I definitely don't recommend these:
- General Tao Chicken on Rice (which is sweet and sour chicken)
- mapo tofu (odd sauce)
- Pork chop with onion on rice (they seem to struggle with breaded meat in general)."}
{"text":"Ordered the combination dinner -- quantity was good, but quality was lacking. Can do better at just about any mall food court that serves chinese. I can't think of any reason I might want to return. It's the standard menu with so much (better) competition around."}
{"text":"I am dumbfounded at my first (and only) experience with Hong Shing. Let me start by saying I work as a line cook and am very much the type to be understanding of delays / somewhat poor service if the food is great. 

Unfortunately, Hong Shing has terrible service for mediocre food... which is what made my decision to NEVER eat here again so easy.

I ordered 3 items from Just Eat (be warned, the General Tao chicken does not come with fried rice if you're ordering delivery, which I was.) Chicken and shrimp were cold and soggy and the crispy honey spicy beef thing was dry as cardboard. My order took OVER 2 HOURS to arrive and when I only gave the driver a $1.50 tip, he said VERY loudly, \"that's it? I came all way from downtown (I live in Parkdale)...  Don't order from us again or it will be 3 hours.\" I stood there with my mouth open. I didn't say anything else and just shut my door and locked it immediately because his tone with me had been pretty aggressive. I called Hong Shing and told them what the delivery driver said to me and what was their response? \"You DO live too far.\" WTF? The just eat website is designed so that you put your postal code in and are given a list of restaurants who are WILLING to deliver to your area. If you are not WILLING to deliver here then why does the restaurant not CHANGE THEIR DELIVERY AREA? 

I often work 80+ hrs a week in very intense kitchens trying my darndest to get food out on time for diners. And I feel terrible when I'm bogged down with orders and am forced to make patrons wait too long. I understand cheap chinese should be held to lower standards but this incident was unreal."}
{"text":"Just tried to place an order tonight (Nov 10th 2016 - 11:15pm) and the guy that pickup up the phone was extremely rude. He yelled at me because I couldn't hear his answer and even after I told him I understood he didn't let it go and made another rude remark towards me. We've ordered from here for years and have spent hundreds each month since my girlfriend and I are too busy to cook. They've lost a valuable customer."}
{"text":"Had their house noodles, resulted in an epic bout of food poisoning. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Despite the previous reviews being quite negative, I decided to go try this place for myself. I had low expectations but wow was I surprised. I ordered the small combination platter (soya chicken, BBQ pork, BBQ duck) for take out. It came out to $11.30 which is not bad considering the amount of food I received. The BBQ pork and duck were average but the soya chicken was really really good. Everything was a little on the dry side however the authentic 5 spice flavor was definitely there. Can't really vouch for the entrees or waiter service here but the Chinese bbq is pretty solid."}
{"text":"4 of us decided to check this place out after visiting Chinatown. Ordered beef and broccoli, spicy shrimp ,orange beef, spicy beef noodles, chicken with black bean sauce, spring rolls and fried rice. The service was fast and quick, and the food was really good and hot. I'll definitely be back to eat there again"}
{"text":"Hong shing is lit. I always come here after a late night of shenanigans. If you're coming here sober, you're doing it wrong and probably won't enjoy it."}

{"text":"Hong Shing is a super reliable restaurant for cheap Chinese food- the kind of restaurant every neighbourhood should have.  They have all the dishes you've come to live and then some on their massive menu.  Walking into Hong Shing feels like walking into a family friends house.  

They're currently in the process of revitalizing, which is really encouraging to see.  Most of the food is pretty standard North Americanized Chinese food- and as the Toronto Star article says, to make food this cheap you can't use exceptional ingredients, so you get what you pay for.  But the value is good and the taste is right."}
{"text":"Searched online via blogTO's late night eats and was not impressed. Mediocre flavour for their chow mien and fried rice, extremely expensive. Fast delivery though. Won't resort to BlogTO's recommendations anymore nor would I order from here again. 

Better options out there."}
{"text":"Where to begin. I have been frequenting this particular establishment for many years; since 1995 at least.  Thankfully it hasnt changed much over the decades. Although they updated the appearance of the menu, the selection is essentially the same. The food, similarly, has not changed at all. 

In the old days i used to get the rice box with various meats in it. There was always a wide variety of juicy hanging meats in the window to tempt and entice the passerbys; the duck was always my favorite.  

I have been getting the chinese window meats for many years at many different places, but my heart always goes back to flavour of the chicken & duck at this place. 

Im saddened by the fact that i dont get downtown as much as i used to in the old days, and thusly i dont get to go to this wonderful place anymore. 

Its nice to see its still there, and still open late. I went there with some friends recently at night and the selection of dishes we sampled was as delicious as it always was (Chef Emiril Legasse used to say on his TV show that \"Delicious is an under-utilized word\" - but it is very appropriate in this instance). 

Its not the fanciest place downtown, but its nice & quaint, and the food is reliable & tasty. I hope it stays around for many more years. 

Incidently, the staff there is still the same (at least partly) now as it was when i first started going there. When i came back to this place after doing my residency in the US, they recognized me immediately and said \"hey, where you been\"! 

Despite all this, it pains me to not give it 5 stars. Its a 4 star place at best, (on its best day)."}
{"text":"I used to eat at this restaurant on a regular basis. The service is awful (rude waitstaff) but the food made up for that. One of the waiters who I saw regularly weekend late nights genuinely act disgusted at having to serve tables.. But the food that they do serve is very tasty and reasonably priced. 
I will not go back due to my last experience. 
While the waiter was bringing our spring rolls a customer carelessly took off her sweater and smacked the plate out of his hands. I know this was her fault and not his, but he went to the back with the spring rolls.. And came back with the same ones that had fallen on the floor.. It was obvious as they were all cracked apart and large flakes were missing near the ends. Also, considering how long we waited for the first order I find it impossible that he walked in and immediately walked back out with fresh ones. I asked the waiter if they were new and he said yes and smirked while walking away... I obviously did not eat it and also now questioned the rest of the food.
I can't bring myself to go back for fear of the food standards."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Hong Shing for over 10 years now. No one makes general Tao like they do. This restaurant is a late night staple for my friends and I. So much so, that I had them cater my late night buffet at my wedding. They never disappoint and the staff is always friendly and welcoming. Hong Shing will always by my go to for Chinese food.
Must try's when eating here are:
General Tao Chicken
Chilli Chicken 
Spicy squid 
Honey spicy crispy beef
Spicy green beans
Shanghai noodles"}
{"text":"If you can ignore the tacky waiter outfits and gum under the tables.  They serve food cooked properly.  Amazing recipes. Spicy squid was my favourite. Will go back."}
{"text":"This is literally my favourite Chinese food spot...I will drive out of Mississauga and go downtown just to eat here. Very fast service though it can get really busy on Saturday nights when people hit this spot after the club to eat. Their General Tso chicken is amazing, and I personally am I big fan of their pan fried noodles with bean sprouts. I will sometimes go to Tremendous in Mississauga if I'm not feeling the drive to Toronto but honestly, they can't compare."}
{"text":"This is and will always be my favourite Chinese place in the city. The environment is questionable but the food is delicious and they are always open late. I recommend the crispy spicy honey beef it's seriously the best thing I have ever put in my mouth LOL I could eat it everyday and not tire of it. It's dangerous seriously!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out and specified a seafood allergy, which was either missed or ignored since I ended up with a shrimp infested dish. Called back to complain and they offered to send a new one, but honestly wishing I had just asked for a refund since the food was pretty awful. All of the dishes we ordered were bland and the vermicelli noodles specifically were really bad. Will not order from here again."}
{"text":"This is my go-to Chinese takeout spot in the city! Delivery is always fast and tasty, their hours are great. I enjoy many dishes from here including the spicy shrimp, general tao chicken, pork fried rice, etc. The only thing I've tried and not liked was the crab soup. 

Definitely recommend, staff is also very friendly."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a fine dining experience, this is not the place for you.  However, if you are looking for great tasting food with good portions, then try this joint.   It has been a favorite place of my family for years.  However, we always order the same dishes: chili chicken (i substitute tofu for the chicken though), spicy green beans, and general tao tofu.  It is consistently delicious.  And Ester is always helpful and knows what we want."}
{"text":"I love the fact that this place is open until 4 am. Whenever I feel like grabbing a midnight snack, or when my friends and I come back from the club, this is the first place I think of. The food is passable, but still good enough to where I'm bound to come back."}
{"text":"Hong Shing has been updated to a more modern look and the food is still Highly Stellar as ever!

We had a wine pairing with the best-selling dishes. It was concocted by Colin and what an amazing and unique experience it was!

The dishes were:
1. Crispy Wontons - So crispy, flavorful and juicy!

2. Crispy Garlic Ribs - I love this for being fried to perfection. Tender, juicy and full of meaty goodness! 

3. Cantonese Style Lobster - Lobster  was tasty and flavorful mixed with the sauce.

4. Spicy Deep Fried Shrimps - The bestseller and super recommended item! Jumbo shrimp deep fried to perfection with spices that create an exotically great taste!

5. Braised Broccoli Corn And Mushrooms On Oyster Sauce - The vegetables were fresh and the oyster sauce added to the taste!

6. Sizzling Beef with Cashew and Garlic - The beef was very tender and juicy. The cashews gave it a crunchy bite!

7. Cantonese Chow Mien - The portions of beef, chicken, shrimp, squid and veggies mixed with the crispy noodles were generous. The noodles were still crispy despite being immersed in sauce!

9. General Tao Chicken - A delectable balance of sweetness and sourness added to the chicken! 

Are you in downtown and looking for delicious and filling Chinese food even at 3
4:45 am? Head to Hong Shing as it closes \"early\" at 5 am :)"}
{"text":"1st time posting a yelp review and i made an account just for this restaurant so yeeh. came in here with my gf and was like ouu this place looks pretty nicee, smells clean. The nice lady at the front told us we can sit at the window, so we did. now here's the bad part. the waiter comes and gave us our eating sticks and cups of water. the cup looked really dirty and felt dusty, and same with the chopsticks. when we decided to order the waiter was very rude, unfriendly, impatient and talked fast as hell. now here's the funny thing. we later saw the same waiter like 2 minutes later talking to these other customers who weren't \"visible minority\" normally, friendly, patient and talked really slow. i was baffled! BAFFLED! but anyways he was nice after he got the tip.

for the food, we ordered number 132 and 156. the food was okay, nothing special, taste like any other Chinese restaurant places.

gave this place a 2 star cause of the nice lady in front saying hello and bye to us, give her a raise!"}
{"text":"I had the Beef and Broccoli on rice.

Quick and easy, only 7 something for the combo I got. As many others have stated this food is perfect for the munchies, the portions are large and the taste will satisfy that Chinese food craving, though of course, it could be better.
The beef and broccoli on rice featured good sized pieces of beef and crunchy green broccoli. The sauce was typical of this dish and tasted fine."}
{"text":"Eating in the restaurant is much better than delivery.  Ordered on a normal night for delivery in the Harbourfront area and the food came in 2 hours, no exaggeration.

Find another restaurant if wanting Chinese delivery."}
{"text":"Many nights this is our place to get food from, from spicy chilli chicken to general Tao can't complain"}
{"text":"I've only been here at 2am or somewhere around then after a night out. Expect to be seated around other partiers. Virtually unrecognizable during the day. 

Order the spicy crispy beef which even works as leftovers when the sun comes up. The only other dish I've tried is the chicken fried rice which was edible but didn't really taste like anything. Good for quick takeout and late night cravings."}
{"text":"their dishes are way too salty and msg-based. They put too much soy sauce on fried rice I don't get it. I don't think I will be a returning customer."}
{"text":"Lunch menu is not too bad.  This place is very inexpensive and the portions are huge.  Definately recommend for some fairly authentic chinese."}
{"text":"I loved The Garden's (Dry) Chilli Chicken with fried vermicelli noodles but they closed down. I had difficulty finding this type of Chilli Chicken in Toronto/GTA until I found out Hong Shing makes it the same way. It's a little bit different than the Garden's version but still very good!!"}
{"text":"I got my first taste of Hong Shing during a foodie event and got to sample 8 of its popular dishes. I enjoyed all the dishes but my three favorites for the night were the Spicy Deep Fried Shrimps, Crispy Garlic Ribs and Cantonese Chow Mein. 

Another important thing to note - I am one of those Asians with slight shellfish allergy. I get hives and redness all over my skin whenever I eat shellfish that's not fresh (because of the elevated levels of preservatives and sulfite in them). I never got any allergic reaction from any of the dishes, considering the amount of shrimps and lobster I ate. So, I can attest to the freshness of the seafood being served here and will definitely have Hong Shing in mind when I'm on the hunt for seafood. 

I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves authentic Chinese food and is looking for the best bang for the buck. The menu contains a lot of variety to cater to different palates, vegans and vegetarians. The portions are generous and prices are very reasonable. Plus, they are open everyday all the way to 5am to satisfy last minute cravings for Chinese food!

Crispy Wontons (Deep fried wontons served with sweet and sour sauce)
The wonton wrapper was crispy all through out and not very oily. The shrimps inside were fat and juicy, just the way I like them. Very tasty even without the sauce!

Crispy Garlic Ribs (Deep fried marinated pork ribs served with house sauce)
The ribs were marinaded for 24 hours and believe me, it makes a big difference in the flavour and tenderness of the meat. The crispy garlicky crust provides a good contrast to the juicy meat when you bite into it. The crispy garlic flakes on top are a bonus for those who love garlic such as me!

Cantonese Style Lobster (Deep fried lobster tossed in a garlic, green pepper and chili sauce)
One of my measures for perfectly cooked lobster is how easy it is to remove the lobster meat from the shell. This dish passed with flying colors. The lobster was meaty and fresh. As a warning, this dish is a bit messy since the sauce is sticky. I always use my hands when I dig into the lobster meat, since it's really the best way to enjoy them and savour the finger-licking goodness of the sauce. The dish did come with wet wipes and additional napkins to clean your hands with once you're done.

Spicy Deep Fried Shrimps (Deep fried jumbo shrimps tossed in a garlic, green pepper and chili sauce)
They weren't kidding when they called these shrimps jumbo! The size of the shrimp gives it a great bite. There's a spicy kick to these shrimps which should suit most people - not too spicy to warrant a glass of water but enough chili spice that you won't need sauce to polish these off.

Braised Brocolli, Corn and Mushrooms on Oyster Sauce (Stir fried brocolli, baby corn and mushrooms braised in oyster sauce)
I'm not a veggie person and would normally not order any vegetable dish when I eat out. This was still quite good. The brocollis and baby corns were very crisp and fresh. The mushrooms were juicy and pop in your mouth when you suck on them (seriously, try doing it!). The oyster sauce did not overpower the vegetables.

Beef in Black Pepper Sauce (Stir fried beef and veggies in black pepper sauce)
The beef cubes were very tender and soft. There were no sinews which was a big plus, since I don't enjoy beef that I can't chew properly or that get stuck to my teeth when chewing. The veggies gave a good balance to this dish, so it doesn't feel too heavy. 

Cantonese Chow Mein (Stir fried beef, chicken, shrimp, squid and veggies served over crispy noodles)
I'm typically not a big fan of chow mein since the noodles generally end up either too crunchy or too soggy/soft. However, this was a welcome surprise. First off, there was a ton of meat in this dish so you don't feel gypped. The consistency of the sauce is thick enough to coat the noodles and give an even flavour, and not too watery to sink down and cause the noodles underneath to be soggy. Definitely one of the best chow mein dishes I've had!

General Tao Chicken (Deep fried chicken tossed in a chili sweet & sour sauce served with fried rice)
The sauce used for this tasted like sweet and sour, with a very little hint of spicy. The chicken really pairs well with the fried rice, due to the mix of sweet and salty flavour profiles. Even with the sauce, the chicken maintains its crunch. The chicken meat is very tender, without being stringy."}
{"text":"Very authentic Hong Kong style food. A convenient and tasty stop for quick won ton noodle soup for 4.99 lunch.  A tasty, reasonably-priced, and varied lunch menu means the place is usually packed so expect a short wait during peak hours.  My only complaint is that their shrimp are not de-veined!"}
{"text":"I come here regularly with my family for authentic Cantonese Chinese food. Value is great, portions are reasonable, service is friendly and efficient, and the food is tasty. The restaurant itself was recently renovated which gives it an updated look, too. We'll continue to come here for great Chinese food at a convenient location."}
{"text":"This is a good spot! The food is relatively good and is served in good portion! I wouldn't say it has the best service, though its staff are active and good. So, all in all you won't regret spending your money here!
Note that they only accept cash and credit card!"}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is clean and spacious and the servers seemed nice enough.  I ordered their dry fried rice noodle with beef and bean sprouts which was competently made.  I was a little disappointed at how their hot chili oil was kind of tame though as I had to use a lot of it.

The place seems to be popular as it became crowded at only 5pm on a weekday.  Some of the other dishes that the customers were enjoying looked interesting so I can see myself coming back to try other items on their menu."}
{"text":"It's all about the Red Nuclear GENERAL TAO! Best in the city!

Recommended with steamed rice. Other dishes of interest, Beef Curry Brocolli (tons of curry to soak in a side steamed rice).

This place is really about its TAO, everything else can be found at another chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"I'd give a \"0\" if I could. Ordered food because they have good IG presence. EXTREMELY disappointed! Specifically told them shrimp allergy a million times & NO pork. Opened up & find this!!  Rice has PORK & SHRIMP!  Amount of times I repeated NO SHRIMP & allergy & even had a long discussion regarding the same. They said they can't change the oil but have never had issues in the past. Called them and have been on hold for over 7 mins and no one even came to assist me that I finally hung up. Horrible service!"}
{"text":"I ordered in from this place. We had fried rice and chilli chicken. It was good. They also packed 2 fortune cookies for us. Stays open till late so it's good for takeout."}
{"text":"I ate here during my last vacation to Toronto and when I bit into my eggroll, I tasted something weird. Turns out there was a cockroach inside my egg roll. I was completely disgusted. Then the waitress and manager were extremely rude to me and tried to pretend I did something wrong. It was very hard to understand them because no one in this restaurant really speaks English. Be very careful with this place - they keep very unsanitary conditions; I also noticed a few flies hovering around the food."}
{"text":"I happened to walk by here late one night, on the way home, and decided to try some pick up.  Important to note: Chinese food (the fast-food, greasy kind, that is) gives me nightmares.  As in, literally I have bad dreams after eating Chinese food.  I had experienced this with just a mild sampling of Swatow, so even well-received bad-Chinese food does it to me.

I had an egg roll, Shanghai noodle, wonton soup and sweet and sour chicken.  The order was fast, ready in about 10 minutes.  Everyone else in the place at that time looked like a gang member and I felt like 10 minutes was long.

Everything was below standard and I wouldn't get again, except the Shanghai noodles, which I really really liked.  So why 3 stars if I'd only get 1/4 dishes again?  Open super late, and - drumroll - no nightmares!!  So I'd definitely be back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Hong Shin is Hong Great!

I just got finished stuffing face with a tasty lil' order of Wonton Soup, Singapore Noodles, Chicken Balls, Crispy Beef and Supreme Fried Rice. Let me tell you something my face is most certainly \"stuffed\"!

This is just some damn good Chinese takeout and when my fortune cookie told me to \"Give us a great review on Yelp!\"**. Well I just couldn't resist giving them the highest honour one can bestow upon a Chinese delivery restaurant, 3 stars.

They're large delivery area isn't hurting either.

3 out of 5 stars for the dinner.
1 out  of 5 stars to Just Eat as their app has been going downhill faster than my stock portfolio!

**My fortune cookie did not say this. It said \"You are capable of great things\""}
{"text":"Problem is they advertise @Amex then don't want to take it....\"doesn't fit in machine\", but when my Visa didn't fit they could suddenly swipe instead of insert.  What are we all stupid and don't see this charade?  Screw this place, better they simply say no Amex. 

And I've been to Hong Kong many times, this place is not \"hong kong style\".  

And the kid who brought my food out seriously hated me when I asked for mustard.  

Again don't go."}
{"text":"I come here often for the chinese bbq rice (bbq pork, duck, soy sauce chicken, crispy pork belly, or mix of above) for lunch, and they're often very good. Service is quick and friendly, and prices are reasonable. Other times I get the cantonese fried noodles, seafood fried noodles, or curry beef brisket rice, and they''re often very good too, but the meat portion varies at times (sometimes more meat one day, less another day).

Quality: 7.5/10. Service: 7.5/10. Value: 7.5/10. Overall: 7.5/10."}
{"text":"This place is a racist joint. We ordered a cold HK milk tea but requested less sugar and ice (a completely reasonable order). They gave us a watered down version of \"tea\" with no ice and too much water. Then when we requested to change it, they started speaking in Cantonese to each other complaining about how we didn't know what to order. Unfortunately for them, I was with my Hong Kong Cantonese speaking friend. Thus, this review. Don't go here if you have some dignity to protect. go to chatime instead for bubble tea."}
{"text":"I love it here. Late night Toronto chinese. Lots of people prefer Garden but I still come here. It's fast and reasonably priced and the foods always good."}
{"text":"That Umbrella Guy @ Hong Shing.

Hong Shing is one of those restaurants that I always pass by, but never enter.
This time we had a lunch social at this location so I decided to give it a try.

On your way in, you'll see a BBQ counter with lots of fresh meat just hanging around.
The interior is spacious, with lots of tables lined up in rows. It gets busy during lunch, so consider coming a bit earlier (closer to noon) or a bit later to avoid the crowds.

Washrooms are located on the same floor, and from the outside I was expecting a small room with the basics. But then when you actually open the door, it's a pretty big washroom that's relatively well-maintained for a chinese restaurant downtown.

Their menu comes with a number of lunch specials advertised on the first and second pages. Some combos come with a cup of hong kong style milk tea. However, I was more interested in their BBQ section since all of the dishes were under $10. There was an option for \"Duck, Chicken, and Pork on rice\" all in the same plate, so what better way to try all of them at the same time?

The food comes out pretty fast. Almost...a bit too fast, but then again the BBQ is hanging up front so all they really have to do is cleave it up, so the timing makes sense.

The meat wasn't very hot. I mean, sure, I did spend a minute taking pictures, but it seemed to have cooled down a bit TOO fast. The amount of meat that they give is pretty good, given that I'm getting 3 different types. I found all of the meat to be a bit too greasy and salty.

They do bill splitting, but you need to explicitly tell the waiter while taking orders otherwise they'll assume you want one bill. We didn't know and some other waiter gave us a lecture on how it works here.

They also say that they accept cash and credit, no debit, but they'll only allow credit on $10 purchases or above."}
{"text":"The Lobster!!! As a foodie, I was so impressed with this place. The food was outstanding. I tasted a lot of the menu, from the whole spicy lobster to the chicken wings to the general tso's to the fried rice to the vermicelli noodles...they were all pretty good. However, that lobster was amazing and I just want to go back there just to get it again! The prices are super cheap, just like they are in Chinatown NYC and this is the only other place I'd put close to Wo Hop.

The service is super quick and they are extremely friendly. If you are with a large group, they seat you in a private room and it gives the entire experience of personal dining, which was great. I'm definitely going back when I'm in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Meh- when you cant make up your mind late at night and you need something to eat.

Hon Shing seems to ring a bell. however, it is on the pricier side. The food quality has deteriorated. They seem to bring the food out super fast- making me think that my favourite spicy shrimp has now been replaced and not freshly made.

Meh."}
{"text":"We were seated quickly even though it was rush hour. There were many people there around 12-1 as well. My friend ordered the spicy chicken lunch combo with a veggie spring roll while I had the efu noodles. I was expecting the efu noodles to come with a nice somewhat thick yummy ginger sauce but the \"sauce\" was primarily oil. The efu noodles were stir fried with mushrooms. I felt that there could have been more flavours. However, it was a cheap deal. The servers are quick and nice too. I may come back to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"Great service and lots of seating area. This is a good place to go for late night eats. I recommend coming here as a group because the servings are large. The dinner for one deals are a bargain and there's lots of vegetarian options. After ordering, your meal comes fast. The meals taste similar to any Chinese restaurant take out or Chinese buffet, but with better friendlier service and bigger portions."}
{"text":"For this reservation, L had reserved about 20-30 people's worth of seats and arranged a set group dinner for $35 a head.  Hong Shing served standard Chinese food in a no frills type of restaurant.

At first, there was some confusion because the staff said that there weren't any reservations made for our group dinner.  However, after some e-mails and discussion, they acknowledged our booking and we sat at two tables in a private room in the restaurant.  (It seemed as if their staff didn't have any good communication with each other and the person who booked our reservation didn't write it down or inform the staff of our booking -- it didn't help that that person wasn't working that day either.)

It was a set meal.  The original menu for $35 included ten items: House Special seafood soup, BBQ meat combination plate, Lobster with ginger & onion, Steamed fish, Spicy deep fried seafood, Chinese mushroom with baby bok choy, General Tao chicken, Cantonese chowmein, House fried rice, and Honey Spicy Crispy Beef.

For our group dinner, instead of the seafood soup, it was changed to a wonton soup; the lobster was changed to chili chicken; and the steamed fish was changed to another dish like \"egg rolls, and some crispy won tons or some noodles\" because it was thought that there was too much seafood in the set menu.  ...  This price included all tips and tax.

Once everyone had arrived and we informed the servers they could begin serving the food, the courses of food arrived rapidly and in quick succession.  We were told that we had to give back the table by 8 p.m. for another reservation which was completely fine and doable.

We received a large variety of Chinese food that we shared family style.  Everything was in good portions.  I thought that most of what we received were crispy and very oily for my taste unfortunately.  Some items didn't seem all that fresh either.  Individual drink orders were settled by the person ordering it.  We received fortune cookies at the end too."}
{"text":"This is a review only for their delivery/food from delivery.

Service in delivery is standard and on par, they will come as requested/a little later but not a big deal.

Food at Hong Shing is only mediocre. Growing up in markham/scarborough really does truly spoil you in terms of chinese food. The price at Hong Shing is fair for downtown but a markham gal like me will say it is a rip. Quality is greasy and salty (as expected) but the items we ordered did not have a kick of asian. Instead, felt like a western asian restaurant and more catered toward the western community. We ordered black pepper beef and that came out very hard (too much corn starch on their meats?) and dry. Their seafood bird nest was mediocre but very oily... can see your reflection in the oil! We also ordered their deep fried wonton as it was a recommended dish. This one was ok but deep fried wonton is very standard anywhere.

Overall would probably not want to try this place again. Would rather treck back up to Markham for good quality asian food at a very very good price!"}
{"text":"Open late at night, Hong Shing is a popular spot for cheap Chinese grub.  Although it looks a little underwhelming on the exterior and  may be misinterpreted to be a run-down restaurant, it's actually surprisingly very clean and organized inside.  In fact, the furniture is spotless and is in good shape.  The only disorderly aspect you'll come across is the service.  Our server last weekend didn't seem to give a hoot about us and he sloppily ''pushed'' food and dinnerware onto our table. There was no spillage and our orders were accurate, so he must have been a master of service that is terrible yet, at the same time, adequate enough not to be rant-worthy. 

We were a party of four and so we got the dinner for four special (see my picture for the list of dishes).  The dishes were all large in portion-size and had heaping amounts of meat.  There's no doubt that for the cheap price you'll love this place if you're a hungry hippo. The caveat, however, is that the quality isn't exactly on point.  Our dishes were oily and were either bland or heavy on the sauce.  Therefore, if you eat here don't expect A+ food; you're going to get mass-produced cheap eats for a cheap price.  

Since Hong Shing stays open until the wee hours of the morning, I would recommend it if you're getting the munchies at night.  If you've been out drinking and need some grub in your tummy, you might as well hit this place up.  It's budget-friendly enough not to break the bank after a night out.  Just go with low expectations."}
{"text":"My review of Hong Shing:

What Neil said. Every word is accurate to the T. Small town chinese restos and smorg joints serve up grub tens times better than this joint."}
{"text":"The food at Hong Shing is mediocre at best, deserving a solid 2.5/5 for food alone.However, their service is what caused the 1 star review. 

I have ordered delivery from them three times before as their hours are great for late-night munchies. The first two times there had not been a problem getting the food, but on the third time, they REFUSED service.

When they asked for my number, I gave them my (519) line (Kitchener area). They told me immediately they would not deliver as I did not have a local number. I explained that they had delivered twice previously without a problem, but the employee was completely stubborn with the refusal.

Never ordering from them again, not that I would be able to."}
{"text":"Delicious Chinese Food. Crispy beef OMG! Like nothing I've tried anywhere else. 

Staff was rude but it was also kinda funny how rude they were."}
{"text":"Do not recommend this resto, horrible service.  I have been to bad chinese restaurants before.......this one tops it

Food pretty bland as well"}
{"text":"Cheap eats...price reflects quality...in this case you really get what you paid for. Passable Chinese food or a late night option; nothing fancy or different. Take a pass on the wonton soup, both the broth and the wonton left much to be desired...definitely weak beyond expectations (even at that price)."}
{"text":"I can see the allure of Hong Shing for the late-night crowd.
The food is fresh.
The portions are huge.
It's reasonably priced.
The restaurant looked clean.
And the menu is vast.
It's just not what I was looking for.

For years, Spadina Garden (one block away) was my go-to place. But it shut at the end of August.
You don't know what you've got till it's gone.
With that restaurant (temporarily?) closed, I needed a fix -- specifically, I was looking for a replacement for their Dry Sauteed Szechwan Shredded Beef.
If you know where to find it, please let me know.

I ordered Hong Shing's Honey Crispy Spicy Beef. It's alright. Missing a kick. There's no sauce. No veggies. Just kind of meh.
The dumplings were ridiculously large); the hot and sour soup lived up to its name.
All in all, solid food. But something was missing.

NOTE: they don't take debit. there's a standalone ATM at the door. but every big bank has a branch a block away at University and Dundas. If you need cash, try there first."}
{"text":"Do not be deceived; family dining until 9:00PM, but gunshots and takedowns from 11:00PM until 4:00AM. Hong Shing's and Wah Too Seafood are the scourge of this downtown neighborhood. The after-midnight crowds do not seem to mind a little fight with their food.
 
There have been 3 gun-related incidents related to these restaurants in the last 2 weeks (and 2 of them were actual shootings). Hong Shing's is not a safe establishment.

Take care walking to your car, or simply along the street, bullets literally fly."}
{"text":"What a joke. Two stars for being open late and having a pretty-looking restaurant. However, I asked for noodles, vegetables, and shrimp. I got a shit ton of plain noodles, a few shrimp (some with tails still on), some bok choy stems, and ONE pack of soy sauce. I stupidly assumed there would be some stir fry sauce as part of the mix, so I didn't think I'd need anything extra. Second-worst $12 I ever spent. Second, only because I'm sure I've spent $12 somewhere, somehow, in an even less-good way. Minus one star for me."}
{"text":"Food is on point for a reasonable price! My go to for late night Chinese. Service is always fast and attentive!"}
{"text":"BBQ duck not up to par at all. Lots of bones, not much meat at all ... very disappointing.
Spicy Eggplant - very saucy, thick and sugary! Not spicy at all!
Chicken and mushroom dish - odd sauce, not much flavour and odd chicken texture. 
I had bites of each and I had to stop as I felt nausea... not sure whether was the sauciness, flavouring (whatever they put in it) OR the combination of it all!

Service was good!
My husband said that general tao chicken was OK!
BBQ pork was also OK!

I will not go back there and I would not recommend it to others."}
{"text":"My friend and I were looking for a very late dinner (Midnight to be exact). I believe this place is perfect for that. Not too crowded, they sat us right away. The service was great, ordered us the complimentary jasmine tea multiple times, as it was very delicious. I ordered the steamed and fried dumplings, and my friend ordered the mixed veggies noodles. The steamed dumplings tasted a lot better than the fried. The fried didn't taste as authentic. The noodles were very bland and a little over cooked. The veggies were authentic with the large mushrooms. Overall it was okay, the service was great, the food could have been better."}
{"text":"Went here today and ordered the chilli chicken lunch special.  I have to say, it was dee-licious! It's not the usual way most restaurants make chilli chicken,  it had crispy noodles on top and was a bit sweet and spicy as well, it was a perfect blend, but more on a teensy bit spicy side.  They give you a ton of rice, but, it's ok, because they also give you tons of meat.  Given, giving this establishment 5 stars may be getting ahead of myself as I haven't tried the other dishes, but, I really really enjoyed the chilli chicken.  The place has decent service, no pushy waiters, big and spacious, typical Chinese fast food dining place.  It's a five because I am not comparing this place to high end restaurants, but am comparing it to comparable restaurants.  I will go back :)."}
{"text":"You must try the BBQ pork if you come here :) that's their best meat. Other dishes are average tasting, but the portions are large which is good. The restaurant is nicely decorated and the staff are very friendly. Plus they speak Mandarin, Cantonese and English! Also they don't take debit so be careful on that."}
{"text":"SOOO...
the food is really tastey it but I got sick from it.. so not sure what to make of that... 

I got crispy honey beef, it was delicious and crispy and full of flavor, I really enjoyed it, then ... later on I felt really nauseous and threw up.. 

So you make what you will of this review lol"}
{"text":"I am a racist.  Ok, you've been warned.  A group of my Jamaican friends swear by this place.  It's their go-to spot for late night eats.  I once took them to my late night hot spot, New Ho King, which they surprisingly dismissed as horrible compared with Hong Shing.  One of them commented on the differing opinions by saying \"black people go to Hong Shing, white people go to New Ho.\"  I got to test this theory out last night at Nuit Blanche (irony being I am neither black or white).

Here are my notes:

1) The place is packed at 3 am -- and my friend was right, there are a lot of black people there.  No biggie, I love black people.

2) Some of the worst Chinese food I've ever had.  Stalls in mall food courts would put this place to shame.  

3) The lemon chicken was a concoction of random chicken parts breaded and served in a light watered-down lemon sauce (Pledge or Lysol, I couldn't tell).  To top off this culinary failure, about half the pieces of 'lemon chicken' did not even contain chicken!  It was all breading!  That is not an exaggeration.

4) The deep fried squid (which is supposed to be a dry dish with spicy salt and chili flakes) was ruined by a few squirts of Sriracha.  I've never seen this dish served this way anywhere.  Another culinary failure.

5) Snow pea leaf was ok, but even this dish was a little undercooked and over-oiled.  It also tasted a bit too earthy, almost as if they didn't wash it before cooking.

6) White steamed rice -- the highlight of our meal and the one thing they got right!  Congratulations, you know how to put rice and water in a rice cooker!

Conclusion: totally blacklisted and not even remotely in the same league as New Ho King.  Hell, not even in the same league as Manchu Wok!  No idea what the fuss is about this place, I thought it was terrible.

***UPDATE***
I think I've figured it out.  People who come to Hong Shing are normally celebrating a glorious (but rough) night out on the town.  When they eat here, they're more than likely in a joyous mood where they are content with anything put in front of them.  Because I don't drink often and came here sober, it may explain why my opinion of this place is so different than everyone else's.

***OF NOTE***
Notice all bad reviews are from Asians.  Glowing reviews are from gwai lo's and others not of the Asian variety."}
{"text":"Came here with a colleague straight from a long flight and was starving. Ordered the chow mein which was just soggy and slimy, the broccoli beef was chewy like jerky and the egg rolls were over fried, burnt with hardly any filling. Not to mention the servers were rude and impatient. WILL NEVER dine here again!!"}
{"text":"Good food. A bit tardy on the delivery. I love this place as a \"go to and sit in to eat\" type of place. The food is way better when you eat there. Lots of options. The lobster is worth trying. The shrimp is exquisite, except they don't clean them properly prior to frying them. The fried rice was made to order and I was able to catch a decent case of the \"itis\"."}
{"text":"Probably no point of this review as I'm sure the owners of this restaurant do not care what their reviews are, but instead to make ppl unfamiliar of this restaurant aware! I haven't been there in years so it was a pleasure to see that they finally took initiative to renovate the place after being open forever! However very disappointed to see that the \"customer service\" still hasn't changed much! Their DECENT tasting food, hours of operation and location is clearly the ONLY thing keeping them in business! Their customer service is non existent and their staff quite frankly are very rude. In my experience last night I went to grab take out until my ride came. Seeing I had to wait a bit I asked them if I could grab a table instead. Outside was like -20 last night!!! I needed time to kill. I was declined with the explanation that take out customers do not get a table! I get it!!! I didn't pay \"dine-in\" prices so I offered to order a beer instead and to my great surprised was still denied a table with a head shake and a hand wave to leave the establishment. My two stars is for my over cooked but tasty chili chicken I ordered last night, however this establishment will NEVER see my business again!"}
{"text":"Oh Hong Shings...

My friend insisted on taking me here, telling me it was 'real toronto food'. umm, ok. We went the night of nuit blanche, around 1-2am. Place was packed with an interesting mix of people. 

They have a very efficient table cleaning service at this place; each table is lined with multiple layers of plastic sheeting. When people leave-the plastic lining is pulled off, and  voila there is a brand new clean one underneath :).  

Our waiter was a funny guy. He got upset with my friend for not being able to name the specific dish he wanted. the conversation went something like this:

'I want a dish with friend noodles like that table over there has'. 

'what fried noodles, what do you want'.

 'ok i want that dish right over there...(points at dish at table beside us)

''thats not fried noodles'. 

'ok whatever it is i want it'.

 'its chicken with noodles' (shakes head and walks away).

We ended up ordering hot and sour soup (nothing spectacular, pretty sure it had msg), chicken with noodles (they were fried and crunchy), and crispy fried beef (best part of the meal, sweet fried crusted beef, very tasty and chewy).

Overall it was an ok dining experience. Service was fast, took maybe 5 minutes to get our food after ordering. The food itself was...heavy and fried, cant say it was well flavoured or very creative. If you are looking for hot, fast meals after a late night out, I suppose this is a decent spot. The atmosphere is a bit on the sketchy side (gotta love those plastic sheeted tables)"}
{"text":"An old stand by. Good food and service.
 They serve respectable tea as a matter or course.
Nice lunch whale shopping."}
{"text":"Stopped in for take out and was out the door in about 15 minutes. The food was pretty good especially considering the speed. The veggie spring rolls and the cashew chicken were especially fabulous. The service was friendly too."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend, a couple times takeout, and one time sitting down. 

The food is fast, decent pricing, good taste. 

When I was seated, literally 8 minutes later the first dish came out. They do their best to get you in, full, and out in about 30 minutes. 

Takeout is also a breeze, with many people in the waiting area waiting around for their food. 

Saw that this place had gotten some bad press lately, but I personally didn't experience that and neither did my boyfriend or our friends. They have been coming here for 15 years and said that they never experienced anything like that. This seems like a decent late-night spot. Hope they can shake the bad press and move on with their business."}
{"text":"Hong Shing is as good as it gets! 

Food is fresh and comes out quick in large portions..pricing is reasonable and for the amount of food you get - definitely worth it and good for sharing! Chicken Fried Rice and Chili Shrimp/Chicken is some of the best i've ever had. Their sizzling plates are to die for as well. You will not be disappointed..me and my sister have come here a few times and have introduced family and friends to this place as well. We are frequent Yeuh Tung visitors but after hearing about Hong Shing and visiting - we have found a new found glory!

You won`t be disappointed."}
{"text":"Me and my best friend are  fairly regular visitors to this place so I figured it was about time to review it. When it's on form they make very good dishes but unfortunately it's not consistent. 

First to start, the hot and sour soup, when it's on form has just the right level of tartness and spiciness and generally it's well done, although some days are better then others.

Mixed seafood with greens is also one of the more consistent dishes with a good mix of Chinese greens and good garlic sauce flavour although some occasions I found it too salty.

The crispy beef is one of those hit and miss kind of items and I suspect it has to do with what chef you get in the kitchen at the time. You can get a really outstanding crispy beef  nice and crispy layer on the outside, really moist on the inside or you can get one that taste and feels like it's been reheated with mushy beef. It just happens to be one of those hit or miss kind of items. The lack of consistency with the food is basically why I only give them an average mark. That may be part of the reason for some of the 1 star marks, because when it's bad, it's bad unfortunately. 

Service is generally quite good, very efficient and attentive although I wouldn't say there super friendly or anything (mind you, most Chinese restos I go to tend not to have much in the way of smiles so I guess it's not too out of the ordinary), and prices are fair with dinner for two usually working out to the $25 range with tax and tip. They have wine too but you don't drink wine in a place like that, just a tip to the loud obnoxious ladies we who sat behind us and asked for some cabernet sauvignon, I mean seriously?"}
{"text":"We ordered in from this place tonight. Everything was fresh, hot, and the delivery guy was really friendly and polite, and arrived within an hour. The general Tao chicken is delicious! This will be our go to for Chinese food delivery for sure!"}
{"text":"Disgusting. Egg rolls were gross. The filling was just nasty. Chicken balls were over fried and the batter was gross. Another crappy Chinese place in Toronto. Are there any good ones at all?"}
{"text":"Coming from New York I was a little hesitant on what Toronto's idea of Chinese Food was. Let me tell you, i was not let down! Hong Shing did not disappoint! I was immediately greeted and sat at whatever table of my choosing, the staff was very helpful and answered every question i had with the menu. The pricing on the food was reasonable considering the amount of food you get. Now when it comes to the food itself, top 5 Chinese food I've ever eaten! The general Tso chicken was out of this world, along with the shredded beef and chili sauce!! The rice was nice and flavorful, barely needed any soy sauce. (I usually have to add soy sauce for flavor every other place) 4 stars service and 5 stars for flavor! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good for the price, and you can decide how healthy/unhealthy you want to eat based on what you order ^^"}
{"text":"3.5 stars even, because they deliver far and wide and late into the night! Still in mourning over the passing of our beloved Spadina Garden, we ordered delivery from Hong Shing the other night. Honestly, we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food! I mean, yeah, its still crap delivery Chinese food, but it was hot and tasty and arrived right on time. We ordered shanghai noodles, hot and sour soup, crispy beef, general tso's chicken, black bean tofu, spring rolls, and rice. We would order it all again, there was leftovers and it all got eaten. Very good Chinese delivery."}
{"text":"Think cheap Chinese food around that area and this place probably is one of the best. The food options are many. The General Tao chicken with rice is awesome. For the appetizers, try out the fried shrimp or the steamed dumplings. The staff is efficient and curt (don't expect them to come to you and have a chat  ). I didn't try it but my friends tell me that the duck was awesome too! The place is not classy but is open till late night and hence very popular."}
{"text":"Delivery took 1 hour and 20 minutes. When the food got here it was cold and actually disgusting. We threw it out. We ordered the \"american\" types of chinese food, chicken balls, lemon chicken, fried rice, egg rolls and beef and veggies. Maybe the more traditional chinese food is better here? But honestly i doubt it considering the quality was garbage."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Tuesday.  They were celebrating their 20th anniversary with special prices on certain dishes.  Everyday there is a special price on a dish.  Today, it was $6 on Cantonese chow mein.  It had shrimp, beef, squid, chicken and vegetables. Now the taste.  It was ok.  Could of use more flavour.  No MSG for sure.  The shrimp tasted fresh!  Some of the squid was a little bit chewy. 
The portion was pretty big so it was great value.  Because we were a group of six they gave us free soup.  What a bonus!  Service was good."}
{"text":"3.5*

I have been to this restaurant many times in the past and they consistently serve up tasty Chinese food with Americanized menu items. 
Service and ambiance aren't anything to write home about but everything comes out decently fast. One thing I find quite odd is that stepping into this restaurant is like being transported into carribana...in fact the first few times we came here we thought there was some sort of convention or festival, but no I guess they just like the cheap chicken balls and fried rice.

I cannot speak for those dishes, but what we do get here is always done very well. The crab meat and corn soup is tasty and sweet with a good amount of crab, the shrimp egg foo young is fluffy and contains a variety of cooked veg and lots of shrimp with a savory sauce. The Cantonese chow mein is really good here with thin crispy noodles lots of meat and veggies and the ooey gooey medley of sauce and noodles in the middle. Once though, we were served burned noodles :0 only once though.

The sizzling seafood and veg is always super flavorful...perhaps a tad on the salty side? The best dish here though has to be the spicy crispy beef! Perfectly crispy and flavored on the outside with a tender meaty center. Yum. The price point is great too so good value for your money here. 

It's not gourmet food nor the most authentic experience but it's a solid 3.5 for sure, maybe higher, given the prices."}
{"text":"The food is good and the lunch specials are plentiful and fast while being priced very fairly. That's the positives. 

The negatives. While most of the staff is polite enough with emphasis is on efficiency, the last time I was there the server was a bit 'too' efficient, thus making that time my last. First off, he was extremely rude, looked as though he was contemptuous of the fact that he had to work there and didn't even look me in the face as I politely ordered my food. The restaurant was empty so it's not as though he was inundated with things to do. He walked away as I was making a request for a beverage and then didn't return until they brought my food which he threw down on the table. When I left without tipping, he cursed at me something I didn't understand, but he clearly was upset, probably about the non tip which he definitely deserved.

NOT worth the trip!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite Chinese Food places! The deep fried spicy squid is soooooo good. Order it and you'll see what I mean. Just remember to order it extra spicy! The General Tso chicken is also delicious. Has a kick to it too...a nice balance between sweet and spicy. It doesn't come with rice though, so you have to order that on the side. It's almost $2 for a tiny little bowl. Kind of a rip off, but necessary to cut the sweetness of the sauce. 

I've also noticed the customer service has actually gotten a bit better recently. 

Also seems to be a popular place with the Cops of Toronto, who get their own private room in the back. Just an observation. You can take that as a positive or negative I guess..."}
{"text":"This is a chinese restaurant in downtown Toronto that isn't technically considered part of chinatown yet. This place is really good. I have been coming back multiple times for the food. Also because they are somewhat student friendly in terms of price, and very student friendly in terms of what times they are open. I have never seen this place close and from what I heard, they are open until 5 am. 

I have ordered (along with other people I have been here with), many things from this restaurant including dumplings, veggie dishes, noodles and rice dishes. I think they are all really tasty.

If you are going here for the first time, I recommend getting this general Tso chicken (it's really popular here and it's pretty tasty) - but just a disclaimer, I don't think this dish exists in actual chinese cooking. I also recommended getting the beef fried dry rice noodle(?) - in chinese it's called \"gan chao niu he\". Or you can also get the shanghai fried noodle (this dish actually exists... In Dubai, I'm kidding. It exists in Shanghai and this place makes it pretty well). You can also try theI spicy eggplant or spicy bean curd or spicy tofu. I have a thing for spicy food since I love spicy food. If you don't want something spicy, their BBQ meats are also super tasty. 

It's a authentic, loud, rustic chinese restaurant. Oil is in every dish (kidding.. There's soup too), loud hustling, good food, not fancy shamcy. It's a place that caters to the white washed Asians, the native Americans, Canadians, non-chinese asians, and everyone pretty much. They also do have vegetarian dishes (although not that many). Don't come here if your expecting a quiet serene romantic atmosphere, that's not what this place is about."}
{"text":"Bad food, rude staff and filthy. I was in a pinch and thought I'd drop in for a quick meal. This was the worst experience I've had at any Chinese restaurant in Toronto.

I was afraid to drink the water due to the dirty glass and the rudeness of the entire staff made me see that everything I've heard made sense. 

If I could give it less than 1 star, I would."}
{"text":"I order from this place whenever I'm craving Chinese food- has yet to disappoint! Comes on time, food is piping hot and ready to eat, and everything that you order is good quality food. I've recommended to friends that were looking for late night eats and they too loved the food!"}

{"text":"Stopped in here for a late lunch/early dinner.

We had the BBQ Pork, Duck & Chicken in Noodle Soup, Hot & Spicy Shrimp and Young Chow Fried Rice and a couple of Tsingtao beers..

Large portions. Good stuff. No complaints"}
{"text":"It used to be one of the best spots to get food in the after hours. But the service and quality of food has had a major setback. The servers have become rude and don't understand politeness. The server told me \"I will give you some more time to decide\"; multiple times! Like he was doing me a favour. I am from hospitality industry myself and this is way under my expectations. Poor job done!"}
{"text":"Hong Shing is celebrating their 20th year anniversary, and as a result, they are offering a special dish each day at over 50% off. I was here on Saturday Feb 25th and they had Shanghai Noodles for only $5 ($10 originally). 
Having been to Dundas West many many times, I have never thought of trying out Hong Shing before until now when my friends told me about the daily specials. Why? Because I just assumed it's another generic westernized Chinese restaurant....and I was right. 

Environment:
Even though they have a good selection of food like a regular restaurant, Hong Shing is clearly also a bar. Right by the dining tables is a large bar counter and they have a big menu on the wall featuring their special drinks. 
The renovation of the place is alright, but you can definitely tell that it had pretty much stayed the same way for 20 years. It's by no means grand or fancy, but it is quite specious with lots of seating space, and it definitely gives out the bar vibe as intended. 

Food:
Between the 6 of us we all ordered the daily special Shanghai Fried Noodle and also the Crispy Pork Ribs (daily special for the day after) at full price. 
The wait for the food was around 20 minutes, which I didn't quite understand, because we were here at 4pm and there weren't that many customers at the restaurant yet. And I mean...how hard is it to make some stir fried noodles. 
When we finally got our noodles I was quite disappointed, because it pretty much looked identical to mall food court noodles, and the price of the day definitely matches it. There were couple pieces of BBQ pork and shrimps here and there, but the majority of the dish consisted of just noodles. The texture of the noodles tasted funny, as in kinda soft and squishy, and we kinda suspected that they didn't use BBQ pork that was made fresh during the day. 
It took about 15 more minutes to get the Crispy Pork Ribs that we were contemplating on cancelling the order. Now that I look back at it, we really should have. First of all, the dish looked nothing like the feature photo on the menu, and the portion was definitely too small for its $13 price point. But most importantly, it tasted nasty. As in, stale meat type of nasty. I'm not kidding, between the 3 of us who shared the dish we all agreed that the meat tasted funny (smoky, preserved meat taste) and the meat was so dry that it was really difficult to chew. Well, guess there's no point to come back the next day, even if this dish goes on sale. 

Service:
I was ok with the average Chinese restaurant quality of service, up until when we asked about why our noodles were taking so long, and they brushed us off very impatiently saying that \"it's coming\". I was thinking of cutting my tips, but then they charged us 10% gratuity because of our group of 6 :(

I definitely would not come back for a second try, no matter how low they make the prices for the promotional period. I refuse to put up with stale food and slow service."}
{"text":"I think i'm just not ordering the right things
normally go for lunch and so far have gotten the shanghai noodles which were okay. next time i got the beef with mix veg on rice lunch special. it was pretty bland.. i didnt mind it but i'm sure alot of people would not enjoy it. 
i would go back to try other stuff on their huge menu.
the portions are HUGE for lunch, i barely could make a dent in it!"}
{"text":"Sweet n sour chicken
#135 egg noodles 
Chicken fried rice 

All delicious best food I've had out here Toronto 
Best part is that they are open until5am. 

It is family style but reasonable price. 
I'd definitely come back for more"}
{"text":"I've grown a bit more fond of this place after awhile. They still aren't outstanding by any means, but the food quality is generally dependable. I've taken a liking to their rice dishes but I do find that their stir-fried rice noodles or egg noodles (chow mein) are rather lacking. I guess it's kind of hit or miss on the menu. The place is a mom and pop shop. Service won't wow you at all as it operates based on efficiency as the first priority, but the place has been a mainstay of its community for many years and I hope they continue to hang around."}
{"text":"As I noted in my prior review I have been coming here for over 10 years. I came here yesterday and ordered my usual. Everything tasted different except for the house fried rice. They used too much black pepper in the deep fried wings which is odd because they use to taste great without using black pepper so I'm confused at why they started.,, Never has the food tasted so greasy and bland almost like eating swamp food to be honest.,

  I wasn't too happy with the service either. We had a female waitress who forgot one of orders and also forgot to bring me a certain sauce I like to eat with my food and brought the wrongs drinks. I asked for 3 orange juices but she brought orange pop. I feel like the servers their are just not listening..

  I was also annoyed by the fact I couldn't enjoy my dinner because of how all the employees were speaking so loudly in Chinese and laughing amongst themselves. I'm not against them speaking in their native tongue but why so loud?, I don't know... I don't know if I'll be back, it's unfortunate because this place was one of my two top favourite places to eat in Toronto,,."}
{"text":"let me preface by saying that this was option c. due to bad luck and mishaps, options a and b were eliminated, and so by default we ended up at hong shing since it was the only decent place that looked open. 

As we were seated the first thing i noticed was the plastic table setting. not to be a yelp snob or anything but i think this automatically deserves a 1/2 star downgrade from the start. not only was it unpleasant to the eyes but eating on it was really awkward. my elbows kept moving each time set it on the table. i honestly don't understand the purpose of it other than to keep the tables clean but how difficult is it to just clean the table with a towel. 

enough harping over the table setting, onto the food. i ordered the sizzling chicken and black bean sauce and my friend ordered some deep fried pork thing. the sizzling chicken was surprisingly good. the portions were decent and i enjoyed the dish. this made up for 1/2 the start that was previously docked. however, my friends dish was drenched in msg. you could see the speckles of msg forming on the pork. after en gulping so much msg my body was in shock. 

another interesting thing was rice was ordered by the bowl. I'm accustomed to most Asian restaurants providing you rice in a large container that is free. for an Asian restaurant to charge you for rice is blasphemy."}
{"text":"While walking Dundas, I stumbled onto Hong Shing while looking for lunch options. The prices are reasonable and the portions are large. I started with the oolong tea and vegetable spring roll. Sorry, but I had to use a fork to eat it. Was piping hot (temperature, not spice). As for the entrees, I ordered the Spicy Chili Chicken over Rice and the Pan Fried Shanghai Noodles. The spicy chicken dish was flavorful but had more rice than anything. Was savory with a good amount of spicy heat without being overpowering. Just would have liked more chicken with it. The Shanghai Noodles was much more flavorful with a savory spice and plenty of noodles to be had. A good portion of meat though I will admit, I didn't eat the shrimp as they were not deveined, yuk. However, with that said, this was a satisfying meal with flavor and portion size. The wait staff was quick to get the orders and bringing out the food, but was not attentive until it was time for the check. Between the shrimp not being deveined and the minimal attention from the staff, this is why I deducted a star. To clarify, the staff was nice; just my American expectations of servers' attention was not met. So admittingly, the fault is partially mine.  I will admit, I plan to visit again as the food was delicious and the prices were fair."}
{"text":"On point for the classics if you are looking for stick to your ribs Chinese food. Authentic? No. Best in the city? Naw. Hit ya right in gut with all those flavours a gwailou like me is looking for? Yup.  The sticky honey beef was a last minute add-in on the order but an instant classic. 

Delivery time was accurate and pleasant to chat with. 

Would order from here again"}
{"text":"2.5/5, +.5 for service

For some reason, my Caucasian friends have a hard-on for this place. They swear by the general tao chicken, pan fried noodles with vegetables, and beef fried rice here, and have persuaded me for the longest time to come here. Now, I know good Asian food, but decided to give this place a try for lunch since it's near my workplace. I didn't really have much expectations dining here.

Lunch rush is very busy here, and there were small lineups when I dined on a recent Thursday. Their lunch specials are under $10 for the most part, although if you want noodles they do charge you extra (booooooooo...).

I ordered the general tao chicken rice, since it was one of their lunch specials. It came with a starter soup (which came before I even ordered) and veggie spring rolls (+$1). The starter soup was your standard Asian soup, and was a bit on the bland side. The veggie spring rolls were actually very good, and they were huge as well.

The gen tao chicken rice arrived very fast; maybe about 2 minutes after ordering. Their portions are huge, so you don't have to worry about not being stuffed. However, I found the gen tao chicken to be high on crispiness but lacking in chicken itself. It felt I was eating more of the crispyness than the chicken itself...when the ones I'm used to in other restaurants have a better balance of meat and crispiness. Definitely not the best I've had, though I guess for downtown quality it's not terrible.

Service was very good for Asian restaurant quality. However, I'll probably not return for lunch purposes, but if my friends invite me here I wouldn't say no in coming back."}
{"text":"I tried this place after hearing about it from friends. Location is great but that's where it ends. Food was mediocre, service was not good and the atmosphere is generic. They took forever to serve us and after waiting, received bland, cold food. Will not be going back, try any of the other thousands of Asian locations right down the street."}
{"text":"This place is so damn good. We had crispy noodle and crispy beef and fried shrimp everything phenomenal. One of the best tasting Chinese restaurants ever. I will efinetly remembrance the crispy beef"}
{"text":"Late night Chinese and in walking distance of my hotel.  We all wanted to venture to Chinatown, but didn't realize how far it was.  Hong Shing would have to do.  Extensive menu.  Some dishes I've never heard of.  Since there were four of us we thought we'd just pick three dishes so there would be no leftovers.  HS reminded me of places in San Francisco, so I felt at home.

We ordered the Shanghai house chow mein with pan fried noodles...very good!  The General Tso's chicken reminded me of buffalo wings with a hint of Chinse 5 Spice(?)...decent.  The last dish, I can't remember its name, was basically beef broccoli with garlic, but was pretty good.  We just drank tea since it was late.  Good size portions.  I was surprised that rice was not included or even offered.

Overall, this place was good.  I mean, the customers were so varied, but it was late.  Some Asian peeps came in and sat behind us, and one ordered in Cantonese, so that was a good sign.  I would come back if in Toronto again.  They are open till 3 am!"}
{"text":"We were walking on Dundas and decided to stop here for supper. Nice space inside with large windows. We ordered sweet and sour pork and garou pas with veggies. We did not have to wait too long for the food to come. I found the food good but my wife got two pieces of pork that were mostly fat.   The price was reasonable. It is an alternative for Chinese food instead of going to Chinatown."}
{"text":"Don't expect customer service at this place! They include gratuities in your bill without letting you decide how much tip you'd like to provide! So if their customer service sucks, you are still expected to pay the minimum gratuity/ tip of 10%. Yueh Tung restaurant (126 Elizabeth St) is much better in terms of food quality and customer service."}
{"text":"I have a pretty low expectation when it comes to food but I have to say I was quite disappointed. The quality I would say generously is food court quality at a restaurant price. The noodles we ordered wasn't very warm when served. They also forgot to serve us our ribs that we ordered and we even reminded them. Finally the service was quite slow in general. I would say the saving point for them is that they do accept American Express.

This definitely ruined my Saturday night. My suggestion is to walk the extra 10 minutes to Chinatown instead."}
{"text":"We were looking for some quick, decent eats after a day in the rain. This place was really close to our hotel and had a lot of people in there. Locals kept coming in, we figured that was a good indication.

The waitstaff was very attentive and professional. They kept our water very full! We had the pork chow mein which I wasn't a fan of but I think that was just my taste. My husband liked it. It seemed very fresh. We also has the spicy crispy beef which we both really enjoyed. 

It is wheelchair accessible in the dining area, we did not check the restrooms to see if they are also accessible"}
{"text":"Our office moved downtown a few years ago and this place is just a block away from University Avenue.  I admit, I enjoy fine food, but I also have a taste for the more pedestrian.  I guess when it comes to Chinese food, I enjoy haute fusion cuisine, but I also have cravings for food drowned in red sweet & sour sauce.  

Hong Shing is closer to the latter.  Their menu will never be confused with the likes of Blowfish.  It's pretty standard stuff, but damn, it's good standard stuff.  I really enjoy their crispy honey beef, shrimp rolls, wonton soup in a great broth and general tao chicken.  I have never enjoyed hot & sour soup until I tasted theirs.  (An influencing factor may have been a severe cold which plugged my nose and taste buds.  But I still love it to this day and my sinuses are clear!!)

What they haven't seem to master yet are noodle dishes.  Their cantonese chow mein is drowned in what looks like placenta.  (Sorry, was that gross?)

If you are not turned off by dining tables with several inches of additiional height from layers of disposable plastic table clothes, you'll enjoy the food.  The staff is mostly friendly with a few curt staff, but I think that's more cultural than anything.  If you see police officers there, don't worry, there's ofent police officers there picking up food."}
{"text":"Decent downtown off-chinatown chinese food. 
Prices are decent, and service is relatively fast.

No Debit!"}
{"text":"I feel like these guys are the only Chinese Restaurant in downtown Toronto that has on point social media. Damn. Check out their instagram. I think they even sponsor events and a basketball team.

We love this place so much that we asked to have their stickers for our laptops. Taste is great. Service is ok. Never had a line up. So satisfying. 

This place is often my go to \"craving\" filler. I highly recommend their Deep Friend Spicy Shrimp or their Crispy Beef. 

Man oh man. I just peeped their website. Honestly guys. This place is on point. If a friend were visiting from out of town and wanted chinese food, I'd bring them here."}
{"text":"We went to Hong Shing Chinese restaurant for Sunday lunch. Hong Shing is an old time Chinese restaurant that used to be very common in that area. The decor was old fashioned and the restaurant was not very crowded.

We ordered typical Chinese food dishes like special fried rice. The food was mediocre and tasteless. Just stir fried dishes covered in sticky sauce.

Will we go back? I doubt it since there are better restaurants in that area."}
{"text":"This is a great go-to place if you need Chinese BBQ in a hurry during the work week.  I work close to the restaurant and have picked up BBQ pork, soya chicken to take home and they were delish - cook up some vegetables and/or noodles on the side and you're good to go.  The place is ALWAYS busy.  Not the absolute best BBQ in Toronto but absolutely fine and perfectly acceptable.  Their prices are very reasonable.  I picked up a small BBQ pork (lean, just the way I like it) for 5.95 and a medium soya chicken for 6.50, total $14.07 with tax.  VERY reasonably priced for the quality they provide."}
{"text":"We came here as we were really tired and it was late (11pm) from setting up our exhibit at the Sheraton closeby.   We ordered a bunch of dishes (General taos, steamed oysters, dumplings (pan fried and steamed), noodles, Very bland and more Canadianized  than Chinese.  This is more of a place you go after a hard night's drinking and don't care about what you eat as long as you can sober up.  The chefs try hard to make it authentic but fails (but then again it never says it was authentic so my bad).  Best to walk 2 more blocks down for some really authentic Chinese resto (ie House of Gourmet)."}
{"text":"This place is a go to after clubbing...but probably only then.  Not sure I'd go here unless hammered but they do serve late, their spicy shrimp is amazing and perfect for soaking up all the liquor from the night.  As is their beef black bean on rice noodle, seafood fried noodle and hot/sour soup.  You'll need some Gatorade still in the morning if you've been here because not only were you hammered then but now you'll be dealing with some serious sodium and msg...but still worth it."}
{"text":"Service is ok. Big and spacious table that make seating comfortable. 

Only have lunch here and over all the Chinese food is disappointing.  BBQ duck and pork are not crispy, you can taste it's not fully grilled and the meat texture is not high in standard.  When I ordered BBQ meat with soup noodle, I just got a few pieces with more bones than meat. Can get much better taste and portion in Richmond hill area.

The salt and pepper tofu is horrible, not crispy, only see red wet sticky chilli on tofu, no taste. 

Fried Singapore noodles also taste awful. It looks right, but has no taste. I've to add chili sauce and soy sauce in order to swallow it down. 

Price range is ok when compare to other food around the area, but in terms of food quality it definitely doesn't worth this price."}
{"text":"Good place to go to after you've gone out drinking/clubbing, or it's 3am and you're hungry.  Tastes delicious drunk, and not so delicious sober. My personal favourite is the crispy beef with steamed rice.  Service is usually horrible/rude, but food is usually ready is about 5 minutes.  Good for takeout."}
{"text":"Place looks decent enough, food was good, but the portions weren't exactly great.

There are places on Spadina that have the same dishes, similar or even larger portions, for $2-4 cheaper.

If you're on a budget it's probably not the best place.

If you have a bit to spend it's A-OK, not that it's high-end or anything."}
{"text":"Late night grub! Beggars can't be choosers...

I was walking home from the bar and was looking for the first Chinese place that was still open. I went with two other friends and we ordered a dish each to split. We ordered noodles, sizzling spicy chili chicken, and the curry beef. 

Everything had pretty large portions but everything was pretty salty. Honestly, I was just happy to get some food at the late hours of the night. I would probably not come here as a first, second, or third option.

Service was pretty good and the restaurant is very nice. Water refills are also on point."}
{"text":"Hong Shing Chinese Restaurant is a ghetto late night Chinese place.  The food was okay, but the only reason why you would probably come here is because it's late at night and nothing else nearby is open."}
{"text":"This was not my first time here, knowing that service is not the greatest but the value for you buck is well worth it.  Decent Chinese food can be found here with convenience--either walk in, take away or via Door Dash.

Today's experience was general--nothing outstanding but rather a bit dull.  Upon entering I was greeted in Chinese (I'm not Chinese) I responded in English,\"for 1\" the lady at the counter quickly changed her tongue and asked me to sit down at the small table in the back.  Shortly sitting down a waiter came by and plopped a menu in front of me, within minutes I ordered and received my food--but was not asked if I was getting a beverage that came with the meal; I asked for it on my own.

I don't have a problem dining on my own as I have grown accustomed to it since most my friends are married or in relationships so if I want to try new restaurants--it's just easier to go alone.  In this case I realized that there were mostly men that dined here, there was one other female but she was seated at a communal table in the center of the restaurant.  Next to me was a large table of business men in suits.  

The soup itself was decent, I can't complain.  I enjoyed most of it, there were a lot of brisket so it was worth your money for sure!  The noodles were not too soft but could be a bit more chewwy, otherwise I would definitely order again.  The HK milk tea had no sugar which I prefer and they do give you a packet of sugar on the side of you wished to make it sweeter.

All in all a decent experience but nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"I have been here for lunch before never dinner. I would say that tip/tax no drinks just chinese tea I paid about $8.00 in total. This place is a hit with TPS(Toronto Police Services) 

The only dish I have eaten here is pork chop onion on rice. Meh not bad I guess.

Standard Chinatown decor. Service is quick. Cheap for lunch."}
{"text":"Too bad I didn't even get a chance to try the food because the delivery never arrived. I ordered before 8pm through just eat and finally cancelled the order at 935pm more than 90 minutes later. When I called the restaurant they told me the \"driver was on his way\". In any case I won't be ordering delivery again."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, quick service, tasty food, and reasonably priced. Bummed that they didn't tell me they don't take debit (only cash or credit) until pay time, good thing I had a wonderful friend to save me."}
{"text":"When I lived on Dundas I always used to walk by Hong Shing and be shocked that it was open. 1 AM on a Monday, 4 AM on a Saturday, Hong Shing is always available to cater to your hunger needs. 

It's honestly not anything gourmet, and I don't think anyone would expect it to be. Yet I still find myself craving a special from Hong Shing every now and then. It's either after a long night at a bar, or when I only have seven dollars cash and want something delivered. Yes that's right, cheapest delivered food ever. 

The General Tso's chicken is about as \"americanized\" as you can get when it comes to Chinese food but it's still delicious and a generous portion. For five bucks you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"2.5 Stars

We were pointed to a table when we walked in, and then ignored, without even having menus to look over.  Once the man remembered us, and brought us menus, service was efficient and speedy.

I had the lunch seafood noodle special which was surprisingly bland. I ended up adding soy sauce just to give it any flavor. All the seafood in it had obviously been frozen, and the shrimp were the size of my index finger's fingernail.

I also had an egg roll - this had much more flavor, and the inside was quite fresh and good.

Food came out quickly, and was served when it was ready, so my food came out first, Jon's a few minutes later, and then the egg rolls a few minutes later.

Just a note - they don't accept debit cards, but do accept credit cards.

Would I go there again next trip?  Probably not - there are just too many great Chinese places out there."}
{"text":"Great location with a lot of options! I have been a regular at Hong Shing for years. Most of the options on the menu taste amazing, and the price is very reasonable. The service has always been fast and efficient. A huge plus is that they open till 5am every night! You can also call in for delivery and pickups. Overall I have no complaints about Hong Shing at all and will definitely stay as a regular."}
{"text":"Used just-eats.ca to order from here. New Ho King was closed so I thought I'd give this place a try. NEVER AGAIN. I ordered beef with Chinese brocoli, they gave me regular brocoli but charged me the extra money. Chicken wings are a joke (small and over cooked). BBQ Pork fried rice was cooked in soy sauce and uber salty. Cantonese chow mein...I could make a better one. 

I definitely do NOT recommend this place. Make your way to Spadina instead and go to Rol San or New Ho King."}
{"text":"Tried this place 3x as it's close to work. The first time I got their bbq duck and roast pork on rice. It was so salty!!! 
2nd time I got their tofu and fish on rice. The taste was ok but I had more bones than fish... 
3rd time I got their popular General Tao chicken. Presentation is terrible. Taste wise it tasted more like sweet n sour chicken... it wasn't spicy at all..."}
{"text":"This place has all the qualities of a good, greasy Chinese restaurant. I went here with my 'gwai lo' friend, and he was decidedly unimpressed with the brusque service. Little does he know, that's all part of the charm. Service is fast, the food is simple, and prices are relatively cheap.

Lunch specials could be a dollar or two cheaper, but I'm not complaining - I spend about half as much here as I do at my usual lunch spots. They split cheques without giving you a dirty look, and accept credit cards too - both of which are bonuses at establishments like this."}
