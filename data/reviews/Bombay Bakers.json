{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. Horrible service and horrible food. If you want to get a bite out to eat somewhere, spend your money at a place that serves quality food and will treat you well. Bombay Bakers does neither."}
{"text":"Everything is nice and cheap. Authentic wadapav, served hot, Mumbai style. Ask for spicy (its actually not too spicy).  Pav-bhaji was excellent! Again ask for spicy for authentic taste. We tried Bombay sandwich also, it was OK, could be better. Finally, cost was reasonable and portions were generous. Worth a more than try if you love Wada-Pav and Pav-Bhaji."}
{"text":"Good Indian street food here. I have been here twice before. Had the masala dosa and pav bhaji. Both are fairly quite good. Pav bhaji is a rarity to find in Indian restaurants in Brampton, so it was a good experience. Prices are reasonable so I will return in the future."}
{"text":"This is so far the top 5 places to have Indian food around Toronto. Awesome food and incredible value for money.  They are short on the seating space however the excellent quality of food far outweighs the cons. I have been there 4 times now and always wait to go back again.  Highly recommended for people that are vegetarians as they only serve vegetarian food.  Recommended : Masala Dosa, Vada Pav, Pav Bhaji and Tea.  Best dishes: Paneer Tikka panini and Pav Bhaji"}
{"text":"Love their Masala dosa, Bombay Sandwich and Pav Bhaji. One of the few places serving Mumbai style vada pav."}
{"text":"Being a lacto-vegetarian, it's so hard to find eggless pastries and cakes where I live. But, thanks to Bombay Bakers, this is no longer an issue. Their cakes are simply amazing and taste great. Their other food is delicious too, particularly the mixed vegetable grilled panini sandwich. I will definitely be going back. Their customer service is generally decent but during the more busy hours of the day, this wanes a little. The orders are processed fairly quickly without long wait times. To be honest, when I first visited this bakery last year, I was worried about the taste and quality of the food but boy was I mistaken. The food was really delicious and to my liking. The location is a bit far from my current place of residence but the long drive is such a small price to pay for such amazing food."}
{"text":"Good cheap food, especially Vada pav, although not as spicy as those in Bombay, but satisfies one's crave for the same to get it in Canada. Had visited this place on Saturday, the 30th June 2018. Would go there again, if we are nearby."}
{"text":"As we needed an eggless cake we  went for a last minute cake pickup. The size they had would have been too big for us.   Picked up some mango cake slices, a chocolate bomb, and cream rolls.   The place is busy on weekends and all the food seemed reasonably priced. The cakes everyone loved it. The cake bomb amazing however the cream rolls were plain. The cream filled on the sides but the  inside a bit empty. The crust too flaky.   The menu does look promising as it has all Mumbai street food items."}
{"text":"I went to Bombay Bakers to try their chaat papri and I have to say I was very impressed with the food. The price is very reasonable and the food was really good as well. The location is a cute little location with plenty of sitting space. They also offer eggless cupcakes and pastries for a great price!"}
{"text":"Service not good, tried paneer tikka sandwich not good, tried pav bhaji not good, tried bhel puri didn't like it.  Veggie burger and vada pav were two things which were decent in taste."}
{"text":"I come here once in a while for some indian buns and snacks. Its cheaper than anywhere else the quality is decent. I work in the area and I will always come back if I crave for Indian spices."}
{"text":"Great joint for afternoon snack, or light lunch. Don't expect lot of customer service for food here. Most of the stuff you get here is less than $5, great value for money. Portions are pretty good. Highly recommended for students and young professionals."}
{"text":"I've never been to an India street food place anywhere in Brampton before, and boy am I glad that this was my first spot! I opted for the Pav Bhaji which was delicious and buttery. I also got a Paneer Tikka Sandwich which was just the right amount of spice and flavour, although I wish the paneer was not spread as thin as it was. WE even ordered pani puri for the table which was refreshing and very generous. Absolutely amazing prices! Will definitely return. Side tip: it can be hard to find seating here, so I recommend smaller groups or aim for takeout."}
{"text":"So i had heard about this place and decided to try them out. Walked in - nice and pleasant atmosphere.  Good but then the same old issue - the staff couldn't be anymore aloof. The lady who took my order wouldnt even smile and i felt that she was doing me a favor. What ever happened to service with a smile. I would have given this place 3 stars but have to deduct 2 stars just because of the service. No telling me what my order number is, no help for a first time customer. And it wasnt even busy.  Management should look into this. P.S i type this as i stand here waiting for my order."}
{"text":"Disgusting.... the sardarni lady who happens to be thier chef is so rude and harsh and misbehaving.... we ordered a dahi batata puri, the place was crowded that day and she just stuffed plain bland dahi in a puri and topped with sev and gave it to us.. we went to the reception humbly asking for green and red chutney and tyat batata means potato so told her to put onions and potatoes and we will manage.... to which the mannerless lady replied \" khaana hai toh khaao namak milegaa bas\" illiterate totally....we gave the entire meal which included a Bombay sandwich and they kep the money too..... hope they repay for this lady..... don't waste ur time to get insulted.... :("}
{"text":"They are a vegetarian place. They have pastries,cakes and fresh food. Their Panini is the best in town. They are very inexpensive. They also have a lot of other South Indian food available. I think the only issue is the wait time for the food. This is even when you have ordered take out before hand. Try to avoid them on a Saturday night this is when they are really busy or come early. They could also open the store a little late rather than closing at 9:00 pm."}
{"text":"Great place for quick Indian street food... perfect taste.. good portions... economical..."}
{"text":"Good place for Indian Chat! One of the best chat places in GTA! We ordered a Mysore masala dosa (very good), dahi batata puri (ok) and vada pav (very good)!"}
{"text":"Authentic Mumbai street food at reasonable prices. Yes, I agree with the other reviews on service and wait times, don't expect too much in those areas. Hence my overall score but I would bump that up to 4 stars if they improved on service simply because the food is unbelievably good for a vegetarian place. Just order ahead and pick up your items to go and you will have a memorable experience especially if you've spent any time in Mumbai to appreciate their replication of dishes here."}
{"text":"If you want the best pastries ever then this is the place to go! Their mango pastry is to die for!!!! They make the cakes and pastries without any eggs and initially I was a bit worried about the taste but I was wrong. It was just, delicious! Their masala tea and puffed pastries were yummy too and I will definitely go back. If you are in the area, make the trip. It was so worth it for us."}
