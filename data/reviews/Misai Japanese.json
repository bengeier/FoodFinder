{"text":"The sushi here is decent, but I find it pretty overpriced. They completely forgot two of the items I ordered and near the end I told them to just forget it and take it off the bill instead of waiting longer.   The staff are friendly, but I've had much better sushi and service at other sushi places in Calgary!"}
{"text":"Food tastes decent, but when I started mixing the ramen with the soup in it I fished up part of plastic wrappers, which made me hesitant to eat it.  It was a take out order and they are closed now so I cannot go back to get another order."}
{"text":"A number of years ago, before the new era of Blowfish, Globefish, and Zipang, Misai was one of /the/ Japanese restaurants in Calgary. Sushi, sashimi, udon, ramen, donburi, tempura, gyouza, 'bento boxes', izakaya-esque items... the whole nine yards. In recent years however, I haven't found the service or the food to be as enchanting as it once was. While Misai most likely serves the best Japanese food in the Northeast, it has toppled off the pile of top Japanese restaurants in the city."}
{"text":"Went there with my partner for dinner last night and we both got food poisoning an hour after getting home. Not sure if its the toro or salmon.. but it aint a fun time for the rest of yesterday and today still. Constant sharp pains to stomach and fever and diarrhea. Will not be going back there for dinner."}
{"text":"Best sushi in town!! The menu is very big and has lots of pictures (which makes ordering much easier ) sushi is always very fresh!! They have lots of unique items that other places don't have  :)  service is alright, could be better... Misai is quite pricey compared to all the other sushi places I've ate, but you paying for what you get!  I think it's totally worth it! Very satisfying :)"}
{"text":"As a party of 6, we were seated in the private rooms.  Food was EXCELLENT! I loved the eel rolls, so tender and flavourful. The crispy yam fries were topped with the most delicious sauce. The fried squid was an interesting dish, quite crispy on the outside, but still moist on the inside. The shrimp tempura, gyoza, soup, salad and dessert were mediocre. The fresh and flavourful sushi definitely stole the show.  My only complaint was for the somewhat slow service. Sometimes we needed to stick our heads out to flag a server.  Overall, food was amazing and service wasn't too poor. But not enough to earn 5-stars. I will definitely be returning though."}
{"text":"Oh Misai Staff, what did I do to deserve the corner. It was your average Saturday night and we decided to grab some sushi in the North-East. That's where we went wrong. I've heard good things about Misai about their food. However, their service and prices are a different story.  We were quickly shuffled to the back in a desperate hope of hiding us from the public eye. They were showing us to our own private party room. Pretty sweet, huh? Nope. The problem with the room is that our waitress told us to switch on a light switch when we were ready to order. Hmm.. that's pretty convenient since you don't have noisy waiters/waitresses pestering the customers throughout the meal. The only problem was that our light was on for a good fifteen minutes before anyone came by. The waitress who did notice the light wasn't ours though. So, throughout the night we had two waitresses bringing food to our table. Some of the food wasn't ours. I'm sorry, I don't feel like paying for someone else's mistakes.   The food was very good, the only problem was the lack of specials or deals. I was impressed with Ikura Don, but then again it's not that hard to make. The Yam Fries were delicious, definitely one of the best items. The Sukiyaki is way over priced. Seriously, Calgary why can't you have a decent priced AYCE Hot-Pot.  Misai is good for the average sushi-chode. But seriously, there wasn't anything appealing about it that makes me want to come back to dine. Just another every day sushi restaurant with ridiculous prices that people are willing to pay. Sorry, but I'm not paying anymore."}
{"text":"I hated this place so much that i had to write a review on both listings. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND TASTE BUDS!! i would avoid this place at all costs. their staff is so rude and their food is not fresh... no wonder this place was completely empty when i went"}
{"text":"this is absolutely the worst sushi place i have ever been to. Their service is absolutely horrible, their staff is rude, and their food doesnt taste fresh. Save your money as there are so many other places that are way better."}
{"text":"Hamachi and sockeye salmon nigiri were excellent. Oyako donburi pretty good. For some reason it bugged me more than usual that the non-Japanese sushi chefs were in full Japanese attire but yacking away in Chinese.  One waitress had a very bare midrift--certainly not Japanese attire. The food was pretty spot on, but you simply cannot fake Japanese service.  I did not appreciate being \"corrected\" when I asked for a \"Kirin\" in a proper Japanese pronunciation with the Anglo-sized,  \"Oh you mean Kee-rin\"."}
{"text":"It's ok. The feel of the restaurant and decor is one of the more authentic restaurants in Calgary, but for the price of the sushi, you'd expect a little more. Good quality food, no complaints about that; just lower them prices by 25%. A really good 1st date place."}
{"text":"#100 This is my first check-in here and I had heard mixed reviews from others regarding the service at this restaurant. Still, I like sushi and wanted to try for myself.  I ordered Lunch Combo B which consists of a spicy tuna roll (6 pieces) , cucumber roll (6 pieces) , California roll (6 pieces), and 2 pieces of what could be called an Alaska Roll at some locations (avocado, tuna, salmon, cucumber inside with orange masago on the outside). The precursor included a cup of miso soup which was not too salty and a Japanese house salad. Luckily, the blue fin tuna just arrived via courier so I will get to try one of the lunch specials, a blue fin tuna roll! Everything was fresh but the blue fin was extra fresh.  I would like to rate this 4.5 stars but the service, while efficient and quick, seemed cold and dry like a 500ml Asahi. It was near the end of lunch and it seemed they were trying to rush us out. Since I have never dined in Japan, this could be a cultural thing.  The ambiance is quite inviting and comfortable; it is not too loud and there are tv's at the sushi bar area. Could be a great place for a first or second date.  Note that parking is very limited and advice to the wise, carpool or take transit. It is also hard to make a turn in either direction on 32nd Ave.  Apparently, you can fax an order to 403-250-3593 or do takeout as well.  All in all, it's a good place for lunch for sure and based on the quality for dinner but don't expect the staff to go out of their way to be friendly (which sometimes can be a blessing if you're trying to score on the alone time on your date)."}
{"text":"It has been a while since I visited this place.  I must say that the sushi was not as good as I remembered from a few years ago.  The place was pretty quiet even for a weeknight and there was plenty of parking to be had, unlike my experience here in the past for lunch.  There are plenty of staff around though but customer service is slow given the number of staff on hand.  One thing that really turned me off on this visit was that a few staff memebers were standing around talking trash about customers behind their backs.  This makes me think if they do that to all their customers.  Perhaps if they concentrated on serving their customers instead of talking behind them, people would give them higher ratings on their customer service."}
{"text":"if you found something is wrong with the restaurant but can't quite articulate it, let me help.  this is a Chinese owned and operated! it's owned by th biggest Chinese restaurant corporation in Calgary. some of you might know what I mean already. for for those who don't know. let a Chinese guide you thru.  we Chinese are not like the Japanese in terms of striving for perfectness. this is the case for food quality, service and the most important- CLEANINESS! it might look very much like a Japanese restaurant but that's all to it.  food is just ok here maybe because the chefs did not have proper Japanese cuisine training? service is just like the other fast food restaurant owned by the corporation. some items are way too HK style.   for something as pricey as this, I suggest you go to some real Japanese restaurant."}
{"text":"B - List. Good food and service. Interesting decor and ambiance - part funky town, part Tokyo bar scene, part indescribable. The people get to you fairly quickly and the food arrives with the same speed. Food is good to very good. No surprises, nor creative over-the-top items. This would not be my first choice for a special evening out. However, if you are looking for a boutiqueish stop over, this might satisfy you. Dinner with tea and tip, about $20 to $30 per person."}
{"text":"Craving a sushi place near the hotel and found this place.  Like most japenese restaurants, this isnt japenese operated.  I think the kitchen and help were Chinese.  The food wasn't bad and was quite tasty.  Really likes the Hell Pork ramen as it had great flavor and a nice kick to it.  They spicy tuna roll was average and the raw oysters were a bit bland.  At $1.50 it was cheap enough to look past that.   I found the pricing a bit high here and to be charged for green tea at a japanese reataurant made no sense.  The waitress/Manager Kim was really nice and helpful.  Service was good overall."}
{"text":"If you want your appetizer after your main course this is the place to come! It was the best place to go about 6 years ago and I've gone recently but the service is mediocre at best and i can't say that the food now deserves 2 stars. The presentation is decent but you'll be better off buying a to-go sushi box."}
{"text":"The service sucks. Plain and simple. It always had. I've neglected to rant about it because at one point in time, the food was decent. I've had enough. Waitress was non-existent. After dropping off our teas, she never offered to top it off after until we waved her down. Everything as much as a simple spoon or napkin had to be asked for.  Worst part? She got our order wrong. Instead of getting our 2 pieces of regular fish, she decided to sign us up for one of the most expensive pieces on the menu. Manager came over, sighed and asked us \"will you eat it anyway?\" And never as much as thought of giving us a refund and the right item. \"It's already made, it would be tossed, yadda yadda.\" Oh, when they ask if at the end if you would like icecream? Sounds like it is something they are offereing as your meal right? They really charge $2 for it.   The menu is over saturated with too much *stuff* I use the word stuff because none of it is unique not falls into any one genre of Japanese cuisine. You've got your grilled stuff, you've got the sushi, and a whole slew of izakaya options so it's great if you want choices.......but you'll have to sacrifice food quality. None of the sushi I had was particularly fresh. Service sucked. Don't waste your money if you can go elsewhere."}
{"text":"being a sushi 'connoisseur', this place is on alberta's top 3 easily. the food is more than great, their specials are fresh, the price is somewhat pricey, but once you see how amazing the quality and freshness is, the price doesnt matter. my co-workers and i were here 3 times in a week, and we were never let down.  this is my favourite thing about calgary. the specialty rolls range from about $10-17, they are all definitely worth trying. i typically wouldn't order ramen from a japanese restaurant, but Misai definitely did not make me regret that decision in ordering it."}
{"text":"Was in the neighborhood last night and felt like sushi.  Masi has always been a solid bet in the past so dropped in.  Even for a Sunday evening on a long weekend they were reasonably busy (a good sign).  Ordered a beer, some sashimi (8 pieces), a couple of rolls and edamame.  Service was quick and friendly.  The edamame was nice and fresh and salted well.  The sashimi was very fresh and will prepared.  The rolls were good with one exception.  The california rolls were served with roe and not sesame seeds as requested.  Tried to flag down a server but no luck.  Only other complaint is that for the area and ambiance its quite pricey.  My tab came to $50 which IMO is a bit steep."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in the NE part of the city where it's hard to find a good Japanese restaurant.  They have a great lunch menu and combos for lunch."}
{"text":"This used to be my favourite sushi restaurant in Calgary. I loved the salad and salad dressing, the freshness of the fish, the flavour of the special rolls, the rice and fried items on the menu as well. I felt this restaurant used to be outstanding.  I've been here for dinner and lunch the past six years and I feel the quality has decreased somehow? The taste isn't as fresh and delicious as I remember it was.  They have lunch specials that seem lacklustre and careless. What stood out before, I think, was that they really went the extra mile in terms of quality and taste. Also what stood out the last time I ate lunch here was that it was too expensive for what I got.   Don't get me wrong, this is still a good sushi restaurant! I guess it's just lost that loving feeling lately?"}
{"text":"I went there for lunch..And it was ok. The service was great at the beginning, they ask us maybe 4 times, what we would like to drink. The order came fast. The fish was not the best, but not the worst. I still don't know if it was very fresh. But it tasted good. I had the sashimi and the sushi. Both were  good. The soup and the salad at the beginning were great too. And the prices not bad. I would go back there, because is very close to my office. But if I am in another side of the city I wouldn't drive there just to go to the restaurant."}
{"text":"I was expecting quality or huge pieces of sushi for the price they were charging but didn't get it unfortunately. The pieces tasted old. I also don't remember asking for extra salty broth with their hell pork ramen. Decor is nice."}
{"text":"We were staying one night near the Calgary Airport and the hotel receptionist recommended this place. I ordered the oysters. They had a not-so-fresh scent to them and the flavor wasn't very good. However, I did not get sick, so I'm grateful for that.   We ordered a few nigiri and again bland fish, not super fresh.   The ramen noodle bowl was HUGE. And it had an interesting flavor. It almost tasted milk-based as if it was heading to be a curry Thai soup.   Overall, it was ok. It filled out belly but didn't satisfy our Japanese craving."}
