{"text":"This is a brilliant restaurant. Good ambience (with an excellent soundtrack over the PA), great service, delicious food. Pork sausage pizza, pig ear/pigtail appetizer, bone marrow, bread pudding. There was no weak link."}
{"text":"Lolita ist die kleine Schwester von Lola. Beide Restaurants gehören America's next Chef Michael Symon. Beides ganz hervorragende Restaurants mit wechselnder europäisch inspirierter Karte. Auf höchstem Niveau. Nur ist Lolita noch authentischer und etwas weniger hip. Tremont ist das etwas Alternative Künstlerviertel Clevelands. Dementsprechend ist das Publikum entspannter;-))"}
{"text":"Another place that I have given 5 stars to because it hits a home run in its category (I'd describe Lolita as a neighborhood bistro, for what that's worth).  It's a bit off the beaten path if you're not a local, but bus #81 from downtown will get you there.

On to the food -- started with mussels in a chorizo broth -- ate every bite.  The main course for me was a bucatini with pulled pork -- essentially a carbonara, but made with lots of roasted pork.  My description probably won't do it justice, but suffice it to say that it was a creamy, smoky roast pork concoction that rivals any Italian dish (traditional or not) I've ever had anywhere.  As an added bonus, good service from the staff, and the prices are reasonable.  If the weather is nice, ask for a table on the back patio!"}
{"text":"Absolutely phenomenal.  A beautifully creative menu, yet something to please everyone.  Everything was done to perfection, timed just right, in the perfect proportions and presented excellently.  Attentive waitstaff, a really cool environment, delightful wine list.  I could go on and on, but you get the idea.  

This is a real gem in Cleveland in a great neighborhood - exactly what Cleveland could use more of.  Well worth the drive from suburbia.  I can't wait to give Lola a try sometime when it's just the wife and me (this time was a party of five, and everyone was thoroughly impressed)."}
{"text":"Do not under any circumstances go here if you have food allergies.  I have celiac disease, and I mentioned in the reservation that I could not handle gluten/dairy.  I reiterated to our waitress that I had gluten and dairy issues, but she could not be inconvenienced with such things.  Our appetizer came out and was not what we ordered.  Luckily, I questioned what we were served.  The wrong appetizer we were given contained gluten and dairy.  Our waitress huffily took back the appetizer and replaced it with the one we requested, which I'm pretty sure had dairy in it.  When our entree came out and I started to react, we questioned what was on the pork. Apparently our waitress did not feel the need to tell me that the entree had ranch dressing on it and that it was not safe.  When I complained to the manager, they brought me another entree with most of the sides missing.  Not only was I horribly sick for weeks after this, the manager blamed the hostess for not notifying our waitress.  I'm sorry, but our waitress ignored my requests to not be poisoned multiple times.  She ignored us when I started questioning her after the first misstep.  I should have walked out and never turned back.  My celiac rash and severe intestinal issues were not worth the fleeting pleasure of good food."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere but slow food service and although the food was tasty it was a bit over greasy"}
{"text":"Been here twice and love it. Service has been fantastic, especially at the bar. Highly recommend the charcuterie, particularly the prosciutto, as well as the bone marrow (extremely juicy and well-flavored) and scallop (cooked just to the right tenderness each time). The only dish I didn't enjoy was the fried brussel sprouts dish. Much too vinegary.

Priced very reasonably, and be sure to enjoy their wine selection!"}
{"text":"I came here on vacation about two years ago and I feel compelled to write a review because I still remember it as one of the best meals of my life!!!

I don't think what we had is still on the menu right now, but we had a gnocchi dish and duck confit. Both were absolutely out of this world. 

I am now a HUGE Michael Symon fan and I trust his opinions & recipes over Mario Batali's on The Chew any day! 

I don't know if I'll ever be in Cleveland again, but if I am, I'll make sure to come back here and possibly check out Lola as well. If Michael Simon were to open a restaurant in DC I'd be there once a week. If he wanted to open one in NY, I'd make the trip just for dinner!"}
{"text":"As usual, Lolita came through for an amazing dinner. Reservations here have become a no-brainer for us when considering date night. This time, we enjoyed with a couple of other friends, and they loved it too. 

The food, whatever we order, is sooo good. Try the mussels and brussel sprouts. Dreams are made of just these two dishes. Last night, we also had the charred eggplant dip, a couple Lolita burgers, the macaroni dish and polenta. Yum.

And Lolita doesn't break the bank for a unique and wonderful experience. The Tremont neighborhood feel adds to the whole in a great way. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Lolita. The service was very good and we were not rushed by our server by any means. I ordered the macaroni which was SO good and I would absolutely get  it again. My bf got the featured scallops and was very pleased. The brussle sprouts are also very delicious! For our dessert we got the raspberry sorbet but weren't as pleased, it tastes very average.  I would defintely reccomend Lolita ."}
{"text":"So of course as someone who lives in Northeast Ohio, I've heard of Michael Symon. I've heard countless people rave about his food and the atmosphere of his restaurants. But it wasn't until last night that I finally has the privilege to eat at one. For such a well respected place with the tremendous reputation that it does, the environment was far from pompous, uptight, or anything of the like. The decor is creative, inviting, and warm and I immediately felt comfortable. The staff was super friendly and genuinely happy. I watched multiple people in the front and back of the house joking and smiling with each other as well as with patrons, while performing their duties without error or misstep. This I find, is a hallmark of an establishment that is true to the core. Successful, professional, and genuinely a nice place to work. As with so many other things in life, emotional tone trickles down in a restaurant and from my observation, the management clearly does it right at Lolita.
We had a great table in the upper corner of the restaurant which allowed us the opportunity to observe basically the whole floor while we perused the concise and confident menu. Our server Marin was super sweet and extremely knowledgable (and believe me, we had a LOT of questions). Her tone of service was very professional AND simultaneously fun and inviting. Something I've noticed many nicer restaurants don't seem to grasp and Lolita seriously nails from top to bottom. 
We did the ceviche, the asparagus, a crab salad special, the big board for two, the coppa tonnato, the halibut, and the polenta. All were expertly prepared and thoughtfully constructed. The big board (a charcuterie board of house cured meats, house fermented/pickled vegetables, and house made mustard/sauces) was one of the best charcuterie boards I have EVER HAD. Which includes the many many I enjoyed years ago in Bavaria and Austria. 
To the person who came up with the recipe for the coppa tonnato: You are a god.
This dish in all seriousness blew my mind. The thinly sliced pork shoulder, the dill, and the tuna tonnato encouraged each other seamlessly across my palate. As one crested and began to fall, the next would blossom and revitalize. As the dish was served, the portion appeared small, but 25 minutes later when we were finished, I had revised my opinion. Each bite was an orgiastic experience on my senses that lasted the better part of two minutes. Bravo. 
My wife ordered a couple of glasses of wine with dinner, both of which she greatly enjoyed. The recommendation was for the Martin Ray Cabernet Sauvignon which paired excellently with the food. A big Cabernet and wonderfully tannic yet light bodied enough to be enjoyed with a copious amount of cured meat and other delicate dishes. I enjoyed the Manhattan Project. A variation on a traditional Manhattan which was the first good cocktail I have had since moving from Ithaca, NY to Cleveland in September of last year. Expertly crafted. The oil on the surface of the cocktail from the orange peel looked like the Exxon Valdez. Cheers.
My recommendation: If you are looking for a nice family restaurant where the menu is expansive and everyone can get something safe, enjoy large portions, and not be challenged in any way, do not go to Lolita. On the other hand, if you are a connoisseur of fine food, cocktails, and wine, and would like to experience brilliant creativity, attention and love in the smallest detail of dishes, and enjoy adventures into the unknown of culinary delights, then Lolita is certainly the spot."}
{"text":"The actual rating was 4.5, just not quite to a 5.0, but that's not a spite on Michael Symon.  The food was fantastic, but I thought that the dessert was slighly better at Hawaii so tha'ts why I went 4.5.  Trust me, if you are in Cleveland, and you don't eat at Lolita, you missed an unbelievable opportunity.  Go here first.  Everything else is ok.

Next time I come to Cleveland, I will be here, and I will be here on pig roast day.  To read the full, non-rambling review, check it out here:  http://deckonfood.blogspot.com/2010/05/deck-on-lolita-cleveland-restaurant.html"}
{"text":"I am from Columbus and we make a trip to Cleveland every winter to see the Cleveland Symphony Orchestra and to eat at Lolita.  It is one of my favorite restaurants of all time.  I love the Columbus fine dining scene but this restaurant beats any of my usual favorites in Columbus.

Get the goat cheese mac 'n cheese - it's incredible.  It sounds rich but every bite is totally worth it.  Other delights on the menu - side dishes such as fried brussel sprouts with pork belly, or the white beans with pancetta.  Yum!  I have also had the fried trout and it did not disappoint.

I have tried the flatbread and I wouldn't say they were anything out of the ordinary.  

I found the service very friendly.  Our servers have been knowledgeable and helpful every time. 

Try Lolita - the ambience, food, and drink are all totally worth it."}
{"text":"I'm really surprised (in a good way) to be writing this review.  I actually went to Lolita hoping to not like it.  I know, I know....that's absolutely ridiculous, right?  I'm just not a fan of Michael Symon.  I love all that he does for the city and to bring attention to our culinary \"scene\" but I'm way over the celebrity chef thing.  I remember watching him on Melting Pot way back when the Food Network wasn't mainstream and the shows actually had real chefs cooking real food (who remembers the cook-alongs with Sara Moulton!!) and wish that he was that guy again.  Well, that was the basis for my desire to have a horrible time at Lolita on Friday.  We were celebrating a birthday and the birthday girl is caught in the \"he's on tv so he has to be good\" mindset and chose this establishment for her milestone celebration.

First, let  me address the service.  The wait staff was a very solid good.  Exactly what I would have expected from this restaurant and price level.  Fairly attentive without being overbearing.  Pleasant without trying to be your best friend.  Absolutely no complaints (expect maybe the sour expression from one of the hostesses but who really cares if she can't smile?)

Now the food.  Everything we had was very good.  Everyone was very happy with their meals.  We had everything from pasta to duck to pizza to pork chop.  I can only speak about what I tasted myself but each member of our party of 7 left with happy bellies and taste buds. 

For starters, I shared the beets with my fellow family beet lover.  We were thrilled with this dish.  Beets, olives, and feta cheese - what could be better?!  Not a lot of seasoning or unnecessary toppings to distract from the point of this dish which is delicious, yummy beets.  I sampled someone's brushetta which was very good if not a little too oily or garlicy.  Nothing that would stop me from eating a plate of it but just something I noticed.  I also sampled the pork belly appetizer....pork fatty goodness.  Yum is all I can say.

I ordered the buccalini and enjoyed my dish.  I chose to give this review 4 stars because of this dish, though.  It was just a little too salty for my tastes.  I couldn't figure out where the abundance of saltiness was coming from but it was definitely there.  Other than that, it was a delicious dish.  Warm and filling and quite hearty on a chilly evening.  I should note that 2 other diners in my party sampled this dish and felt it was the best entree on the table.  They also love salt.  

I sampled the pork chop and it was cooked to perfection.  Great grilled pork flavor and moist meaty happiness.  I also sampled the mushroom pizza which was fabulous.  I happen to adore Killbuck Valley mushrooms and these did not disappoint.  I also love this style of pizza so it was the perfect combo for me.  I wish I had some for lunch today. 

My favorite part of the meal was the sides.  I selfishly convinced someone to choose the polenta as a side dish simply because I wanted to taste it.  I'm glad I was selfish because it was really good (so super creamy) and she loved it.  I think the cauliflower was my favorite though.  Even if you hate cauliflower, you will like this dish.  Seriously.  Don't discriminate.

I would really like to return to Lolita and order a couple appetizers and all of the side dishes.  Actually, I think the perfect meal here (for me) would be the beets, the brushetta, the cauliflower, and the polenta.  Can I do that??  Please?!?!"}
{"text":"Lolita is great, Chef Symon definitely hits the mark with this place!!

We had reservations at 7:30.  Half of our party was waiting for us at the bar, and when we arrived around 7:15, we were promptly seated.  We ordered a few bottles of wine for the table and begun chatting/reviewing the menu (mostly chatting).  Service was quite slow, but I think our server didn't want to interrupt our conversation.  We ended up ordering three starters...Bruschetta w/ Mozzarella, Crispy Pork Belly, and the Bone Marrow.  All were very good, particularly the pork belly.

Our dinners arrived approximately 45 minutes later, but to be fair, one person in our party ordered the Roasted Chicken, and the server did let us know it would be at least 40 minutes for that dish.  I had the Duck Confit, which was outstanding!  I also ordered a side of the Fried Brussel Spouts...very good, but didn't see the hype that I've heard from others.  Other dishes ordered by my party were the Flatiron Steak w/ Soft Polenta, the Buccatini, and the Pappardelle.  The only dish we had issues with was the Pappardelle, she just didn't the combination of flavors.

We split three desserts between us...the Vanilla Gelato, the Lemon Panna Cotta, and the Chocolate Pot de Creme.  The Pot de Creme was by far my favorite, the perfect combination of sweet with the caramel and salty with the sea salt.

Even with the conversation, I think the service could've been a little faster, which is the only reason I didn't give five stars, but all in all, it was awesome!"}
{"text":"I had no expectations for this restaurant, which is just fine.  I don't care about Michael Symon and I am really going to think twice before trying a \"celebrity\" restaurant in the future.

A group of us went for dinner on a Thursday.  After requesting a table, the hostess looked down at her seating chart like it was an unsolvable mystery...I took that to mean we should've made a reservation.  (My bad, I don't eat at fancy places much.)  So I asked if we could sit at the bar.

It got us a quick seat, but that's it.  The bartender was pretty incompetent.  She kept forgetting parts of our order.  I ordered a beer that never came and neither did my water refills.  The food was also really slow to come to us.  It was pretty hot in there and the bar stools are just about the most uncomfortable things I've ever sat on.

The food just didn't taste good.  The entire menu was esoteric, and it just screamed to me, \"Trying too hard!\"  I guess if you're into weird food with fancy names and strange combinations, then this is a great place...but I'll take pierogi any day!

To me, Cleveland is about great, ethnic food, not high-priced celebrity.  I've been to the Tremont neighborhood, and every time, I feel like I leave Cleveland.  I feel like \"they\" are trying to make Tremont into some fancy-schmancy destination, and I can't figure out why.  Cleveland is great without high-end food options and celebrity destinations.  I probably would feel differently if it were done well, but it was done so badly.  

Not impressed, definitely won't ever return."}
{"text":"Horrible bar tender!  Mt. Symon fire your bar tender immediately!  

Like always your food was amazing.  My fiance and I went this past Saturday for reverse HH (which is the best invention ever, btw) and had the burger and the baba ganoush (eggplant dip).  The burger was perfectly cooked and the combination with the fried egg is spot on.  The baba ganoush was so flavorful and put all others to shame.  

On the other hand the bar tender spent 95% of his time talking to the rich old couple and ignored everyone else at the bar.  I actually witnessed him walk away from a girl mid order because he felt she was taking too long.  In actuality she was trying to organize drinks for a large group.  She then left and took her business elsewhere rightfully so.  

It will be a long time before we return.  I would rather spend my money at Dante."}
{"text":"Completely underwhelmed and, quite frankly, unimpressed.

It's obvious that Michael Symon is no longer heavily involved with Lolita and that people are only coming here for the name and not the food. The place is overrated.

We ordered the chicken livers, bone marrow, mussels, and pork chop. 

The chicken livers were unique and one of the few highlights. Served with polenta, mushrooms, and bacon--a great taste combination. The bone marrow was meh--I've had better. I did enjoy the mussels. They were served with chorizo sausage--an interesting take on a traditional dish. The pork chop serves two and that it does. I found it a bit dry though and lacking flavor.

The menu is meat centric, so if you're vegetarian or vegan don't waste your time.

Loved the decor and ambiance. Exposed brick walls, Edison bulb fixtures, tin ceiling, cozy bar area, dim lighting. 


Three stars only because of the decor and apps. Would not come again."}
{"text":"I live 400 miles away from Lolita, and I would plan a vacation just to come back here for my anniversary!!  The service was phenomenal!!  Richard was able to answer any questions we had with confidence and authority, and was fun to engage with.  The Fried Brussel Sprouts have made me a lover of them, and I hate brussel srpouts!!  My nephew had the duck confit and wanted seconds!  The meat was perfectly cooked and the skin had the perfect crisp on it.  I had their special which was their Pig Roast.  Slow smoked and roasted whole pig, then the meat is perfectly shredded and placed on a bed of orzo pasta, and to top it off, a freshly fried chichrone on top (pork rind, if you are unfamiliar).  I wanted to take a bag of those home with me!!  And my girlfriend had the Grilled Hanger Steak with a gorgonzola sauce that was perfectly balanced.  I absolutely cannot wait to go back there!!!"}
{"text":"I come with full passion and hopes but the girl at front desk told me to wait 40 minutes because we did not have reservation. We come back 40 minutes later while she told me no seats available and she had no idea how long should we wait.No explanation no beta plan. I feel very uncomfortable and disappoint not only because the whole one hour we wasted but also the attitude she treat guests, feel like I was a beggar rather than a customer. Very bad experience."}
{"text":"Always a good meal, love the setting! 

I've been told by my dinner companions that the pork chop is the best they've ever had.

Not many options for vegetarians and nothing for vegans."}
{"text":"This place reminds me a lot of Bar Cento, probably a tad better with a more trendy/stylish atmosphere. Same type of simple, flavorful, nicely done pseudo-Mediterranean American food, though, with excellent beer and wine menus and pretty reasonably priced. Would definitely come again, and if you like either this place or Bar Cento I recommend you check out the other."}
{"text":"For Cleveland, the past few decades have not been the best of times. With the departure of the manufacturing industry, a declining population, and a stagnant technology and service sector, Cleveland currently ranks 220 in economic strength for major American cities. Akron, its sister city, is not far behind at 219. Dickensian though it may sound, my recent arrival into the American rust belt from New York has been much more gourmet than grotesque. I will never be a Drew Carey fan, but as I've been pleasantly surprised to find out, Cleveland does have the capacity to, in fact, rock.

Since arriving, I've been doing my part to help the fledgling Cleveland economy by spending my money on truly tasty food and drink. Should you ever find yourself in the town that brought you Rock n' Roll, a racist baseball mascot, LeBron James, and the lake that caught on fire, I'd recommend looking into these exceptional bars and restaurants. The only thing Victorian about them is their prices.

Sunday evening I arrived just in time to make it to Lolita's happy hour. You might recognize Lolita's chef, Michael Symon, from the Food Network, and I was pleased to find out that Symon's money was precisely where my mouth was. In this bustling Tremont spot, the happy hour runs every day at the bar from 4-7 and has $2 beer and $5 cocktail specials. I started the evening off with an appropriately local Great Lakes Brewery Dortmunder Gold, a smooth compliment to the savory and creamy rosemary and ricotta cheese dip and freshly baked flat bread starter. At the bar, I watched two brave chefs throw hand-tossed dough into a wood-burning stove, which also serves to make delightful gourmet pizzas.

Appetizer devoured, I embarked on my second happy hour item, a Kobe beef burger with aged cheddar cheese, bacon, and fried egg on a toasted English muffin. Pricing this at a mere $5, considering a Burger King Whopper is just a couple of dollars less, almost devalues the artfulness of Symon's creation. With the English muffin sopping up any juice that doesn't get in your mouth, Symon is clearly after not just flavor, but also function. The sharpness of the cheddar was offset by the tender Kobe beef, and the crispy bacon and gooey egg complicated the texture and gave it a signature Midwestern edge. It's still more dainty than dagwood, and I managed to have room both in my stomach and wallet to sample the hearty homemade mac n' cheese, also a modest $5. Kraft and Velveeta, it is not. Symon's recipe calls for fresh cream, rosemary, roasted chicken breast, and wide macaroni noodles, all baked in the still-firing wood oven. I wish I could say that I was transported back to the comforts of home, but my mother never put anything on the table this delicious. Like the burger, Symon has taken a familiar classic and elevated it to a higher culinary standard than most achieve on their measly gas stoves. I'd like to believe all it takes is that wood-burning oven, but it's probably Symon's Midas touch that turns everything he touches into delicious."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Better than Lola and the best in Tremont. Get the pork chop Milanese. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"A visit to Cleveland calls for a treat so we decided to check out one of \"Iron Chef'\" Michael Symon's places. This is his original location but it is a different restaurant . This review is tentative, only one visit, and we plan to be back in a month or two and will have better take on the place. 

That said, we had an incredible meal. We started with roasted beef marrow & fried gizzards over polenta- both were amazing. 

The pizzas on the menu were so interesting that we had to try one. We went for the duck. It was good but not my crust style- the crust was nice & thin but too stiff- more like a very good cracker- but with great tops including eggs broken on it as it went into the oven it was very good. 

Both main dishes we had were to die for. I had beef cheek pasta- beef cheek the ultimate beef experience- done with a beef reduction sauce. It just hit all the right notes for my taste buds. My companion had a chicken mac & cheese with goat cheese & lots of rosemary- \"luscious\"- her description. Better than meals we have had at Roast, his Detroit location, which we like. 

The bar seemed first rate with a nice beer selection. 

The wait staff was helpful without hanging out to close. The setting, in a neighborhood in a nicely restored older building is attractive. All in all an enjoyable time."}
{"text":"It's true, this place is trendy and therefore really busy, but definitely worth the wait. The food is amazing and the people are actually nice without the attitude that a lot of new places have. We did wait about 20 minute for our table, but the hostess kept us updated and the waitress thanked us for our patience. Don't go if you're in a hurry. Try the mussels with chorizo and the amazing brussel sprouts!"}
{"text":"Creative recipes and takes on traditional favorites. For comfort food with a twist, this is your place. Fresh ingredients on all the dishes. However, a bit salty on most dishes, overly spiced on others, and even sometimes too rich of a texture. The flavors were good there, and the recipes were respectful and appreciated. Would go back again, but just expect a heavy hand with the salt and spices. Service was good, really welcoming and attentive."}
{"text":"Headline:  as good as it gets in Cleveland!
Fried Brussel Sprouts were some of the best we'd ever had, and Roasted Chicken and Warm Chocolate Bread Pudding were all fantastic. A mushroom pizza to share topped it off nicely..this was actually one of my few memorable meals in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Lolita is usually one of my favorite spots and always my birthday choice! I was a little disappointed in our recent trip:( The hanger steak went from 23$ to 31$ and went from great to ok. It didn't come with the Gorgonzola fondue that really accelerated the dish. My other staple the Brussel sprouts were over salted and tasted a little off. Hope it was a fluke!"}
{"text":"Pork Chop - delicious, but slightly overcooked
Duck - outstanding, as always
Brussels Sprout - decent
Potato Soup - superb
Chicken Livers - decadent

So, yeah...the meal was very good. The service was bizarre, at best. It was like the server was afraid of us? She certainly seemed taken aback by the fact that we had questions and clear ideas about what we did & didn't want And she was strangely confused when after waiting 15-20 minutes to receive our entrees, we asked what had been the delay. Like seriously, she told us there hadn't been a delay. Not sure if us looking at her like she had just sprouted wings and taken flight is what made her later come back & acknowledge that we had seriously sat at our table and had our appetizer plates removed and sat there. And sat there. and sat there. With little acknowledgement that we were even sitting there, much less an offer for more water or wine or any-darned-thing. 

So, again, delicious food. Very strange service. When I make a reservation (through Open Table or not) I really don't expect to have to call the restaurant to confirm??? Happy to have been offered complementary dessert to compensate for the delayed entrees. Still a little baffled that homegirl didn't seem to have the language to make it make sense during the wait.

Will we return? [sigh] That's a tough one."}
{"text":"If this review could be a -10 it could be. It's an old review from 2009 and I now live in seattle but it still resonates with me in a way I've never been treated at a restaurant before. My husband was laid off in 2008, the year we were married. We had moved in with family in Columbus in 2009 and were excited to go out and have a nice dinner with longtime friends. We ordered appetizers, drinks...and when my husband and I opted to split a pizza for an entree (after I'd had 3 cocktails and my husband had had a beer) our server looked at us and said: \"oh I get it, you're splitting a meal so you can drink more,\" looking at me. I've never been so humiliated. I've never left a yelp review. We spent more of our very hard- earned money that night than our friends, who didn't get drinks and just got two entrees. We spent more than we had spent in 6 months. I love michael symon and his restaurants. Our family is still in cleveland and now that we have money to spend and my husband is successful in the architecture industry, I have no desire to visit Lolita again when we visit our family on holidays. The food is delicious. I only hope now  the staff is a better representation of the brand."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place.  From the decor, to the casual atmosphere, to the great food, to most of all...the great value!  It is rare to see a chef of this caliber sell this high of qualify of food price their food to be so affordable.  

I would definitely recommend the Big Board of cured meats for an appetizer.  My Pork Chop was cooked perfectly and the Soft Polenta with mascarpone and parmesan was great!

I definitely would visit again if I ever visit Cleveland again."}
{"text":"Came with a couple friends for happy hour and it was soo delish! Happy hour dishes were $5 so we ordered the brussel sprouts, mussels, dip, and cured meats platter ($20) and shared everything. I also got the Beta which was a nice and light drink. I wish we could have stayed for dinner but the timing didn't work out. 

Would love to come back one day, BTW the brussel sprouts are a must try!"}
{"text":"Oh, Lolita, I love and don't love you.

I love you when we walked in one night at about 12:52 am and were very graciously served the late-night happy hour menu that was about to shut down at 1am. The chorizo mussels are my favorite thing here, followed closely by the fried brussels sprouts. 

I didn't love you when you served us the dried out flakes at the bottom of the brussels sprout dish the first night I ever ate here. I thought for a while that people were crazy for liking them....then I learned that we had the table scraps that night.

I love you when the bartenders find a way to get my drink in my hands quickly and with style even when every seat is taken and everyone's double parked behind.

I didn't love you when I made a reservation in advance for the every Tuesday pork dinner, and wasn't told that there was a finite amount of pork. 
Me: \"My friend is coming all the way from Africa to eat this pork dinner. She hasn't gotten any pork in 4 months. We've never made it to Lolita for the pork dinner and have been wanting to try it.\" 
Reservation voice: \"What time do you want?\" 
Me: \"7pm? And there will be pork for us?\"
Reservation voice: \"Yes, great, etc..etc...\"
Long story short (too late), they sat us more that an hour after our reservation and, surprise surprise, there was no pork. The server said there were about 20-some portions and that they ran out at 6:15. Now, I realize now that it was the holidays, and all things run amok during that insane week between Christmas and New Year's. And I realize that it was a group of ten of us. BUT, how hard would it have been for the reservation person to say, \"oh, wait, hey, they just throw one pig on the barbie, and it's not a menu item that's available all evening.\"
That's all I'm sayin..
To the credit of the servers, they took good care of us for our whole meal and treated us to a few appetizers for our trouble. (More for the long wait than the pork question I think.) The meal as a whole was delicious. I ended up with the roast chicken and it was very nicely done, as so many reviewers have said.

In general, I prefer the menu at Lolita to Lola, but both have that magic about them, and I'm always glad to go."}
{"text":"3rd time here and the food is excellent as always. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This could have been a 5 star review if it weren't for the dark-straight haired seater up front.  We had 5pm reservations because we had been in Cleveland all day from Detroit (see stop 1 review of B Spot), and just before 5, the line started.   This girl was rattled because of the rush of early reservations and 'happy hour' folk.

We didn't let it bother us, and were sat at a nice table along the side about 2 tables from the window facing Literary.

My wife started w/ a glass of Simi Valley Sav Blanc, and I had the Malbec.   We then looked at the apps and feeling a little crazy, we went for the bone marrow!  OHH WOW!!  Great choice!  Great salsa verde on top that really brightened up the marrow ..and the toast pieces, topped and grilled in the beef fat,...please, I can't take it! :)

Smother the marrow on that bread  ...... heaven!  My first time w/ marrow and it won't be my last! What a treat!

Main dishes, .... Parpadelle for me, w/ beef cheeks, mushrooms, and creme fraiche.  Very nice!  My lady go the pork chop, with squash, chiles and almonds ....wow!  Her side of palenta w/ mascarpone and parm was UN REAL!!

Dessert was split (I had to drive back to Detroit!) ..it was the coconut sorbet that was special (I think) for today.   Light, coconutty ....delicious!!  ( I know, I know, ...that's not a word! ;))

All in all, ...a great time.  Matt was very attentive, informative, and patient!

Food was fantastic, service was great (once you get past the greeter) and ...I actually think we'd drive back for another dinner!  Hmmmmm"}
{"text":"My husband and I first tried Lolita last March ('12) while we were in Cleveland for a day trip. We loved it. Since we found ourselves still talking about that meal nearly a year later, we made the two hour drive up this Saturday.  The drive was absolutely worth it. Since it was too late to get a reservation, we got there at 4:30 and waited so that we could get one of the coveted seats at the bar. Between the two trips, we've tried about 30% of the menu and everything was great. Some highlights: the polenta is to die for (cooked the right way--creamy like grits), amazing pizzas, great burger (only available at the happy hour and only $5!), cheap beer ($2 Sierra Nevada at the HH), great vege sides (last time we got the asparagus, this time the broccolini). Another perk of sitting at the bar: you can see the chefs cooking and they are mesmerizing.  The waitress at the bar (the same from a year prior) was kind and attentive.  On top of all this (great service, excellent food), the prices are amazing (especially if you go for the HH)."}
{"text":"Lola is definitely superior. We must have went on an off day, the staff seemed completely off of their game.  It was not what I expected having experienced the level of service present at Lola.  

We placed a food order about 15 minutes after being seated, from there it took over an hour to get our food despite the restaurant not being full.  The server seemed relatively unapologetic about it.  I was disappointed."}
{"text":"Tonight I went to Lolita with my husband. We really enjoy sitting at the bar and meeting other people. i tend to ask what they like and order and tonight I was steered in the right direction. 

We started with an order of mussels. They were prepared with chorizo. I am not usually a sausage fan, but taking a little bit of sausage in each bite was pure heaven. The only thing that could have made it better would have been a crusty loaf of bread, but I am sure they would have obliged if I had asked. Trying to be good about what I eat, so I didn't.

From there, I had the arugula salad with goat cheese. Yummm. A little pepper made it perfect!. My husband got the lamb meatball in tadziki (sp?) sauce. I can only assume he liked it because he ate every last drop.

We shared the mushroom pizza. I could have eaten the whole thing myself, if I weren't such a lady. ;)  (lol, those who know me know that that wouldn't stop me!!)

Love it and would recommend eating at the bar -- absolutely."}
{"text":"We have always been super into Food Network shows and just food shows in general.  Being a long time fan of the show Iron Chef and seeing some of the cool things Michael Symon has done, and also seeing his famous brussels sprouts on numerous \"best thing i ever had\" and \"unique eats\" we told ourselves one of his restaurants is a must try.  

The Tremont area in Cleveland is different.  Driving up to the restaurant after getting off the freeway I thought we were in the wrong neighborhood.  I guess Cleveland is just like that.  We parked a couple streets down and I thought to myself.. \"why would an iron chef open a restaurant in this area?\"  I guess it's just part of the charm.  We walked in and waited for close to 5 minutes before anyone acknowledged us.  I realize they were busy and at the tail end of HH, but we had made eye contact with the bartender and he did nothing to get the hostess.  
The restaurant decor is really cool, pretty flooring, a mix of old and industrial.  Even the restrooms were super cute!   Music was super loud, don't come here for a romantic dinner as you'll have to scream across the table for conversation. 

I was so excited when I read the cocktail menu.  Ever since I had the best cocktail at Nellcote in Chicago, I've been on the hunt for something to top it.  I got the Bela - the ginger infused vodka lured me in.  The cocktail was so sad.  Not only was it small - in a miniature highball glass, there was no taste of ginger, or vodka as a matter of fact.  It tasted like soda water with some lime juice squeezed in it. Needless to say, my hunt for the best cocktail continues and I stuck with wine for the rest of the evening. 

We weren't that hungry so we chose to split a couple smaller items.  We had the brussels sprouts, bone marrow, and chicken livers.  Let me tell you, we were soo excited for the brussels sprouts.  They way other celebrity chefs and TV food personnel had described them was just intriguing.  But oh man, were we let down.  The brussels sprouts tasted burnt, soggy but under cooked at the same time, there were no capers and the walnuts seemed to have been tossed onto the dish as an afterthought.  What happened to the sweet, tangy, and crunchy deliciousness I thought we would be served up?  I suppose that only happens on TV.  I thought the bone marrow was good even though the bf thought they were just ok.  Too much bread for the delicate marrow.  The accompaniments were good on it.  The crispy chicken livers was a dish that could have been great but again was just ok.  The pieces of liver were so big I had to cut them up otherwise I would've only gotten a mouthful of liver and none of the polenta.  Maybe this is the way the chef intended for it to be eaten, but wouldn't it have been nice if the livers were smaller and fried perfectly all around? That way, I could have had a perfect little bite of liver with some creamy polenta along with it instead of having to chop everything up!

I wanted to try some desserts but because our small dishes were so lacking, we chose to skip.  I'm not from the Cleveland area and haven't had the opportunity to try many other restaurants, but if this is supposed to be on of the better restaurants, man, I have to say that Cleveland has a LOT of opportunity for up and coming chefs.  

I want to be an Iron Chef too - they get to open restaurants with so-so food but people will go in hoards anyway just because of the name.  (ok, I can't say this about all celebrity chefs, e by Jose Andres in Vegas was pretty amazing)"}
{"text":"This was my third visit to Lolita.  I absolutely love the \"neighborhood-y\" feel to this place.  The menu is approachable, but sophisticated. 

On this trip, I had the roasted bone marrow, crispy chicken livers, cheese plate, brussels, and polenta.  Everything was wonderful!

For drinks, I had a glass of bubbly and a glass of white bordeaux.  The Etoille Brut was perfect before the meal - bubbly is always a good way to excite the palette and generate an appetite.  the Bordeaux was a great companion to the appetizers.

I recommend this place for a nice meal with a good friend or for a date."}
{"text":"Still kicking with 4 stars for me. I went with the Hangar Steak, pickled chilies and chick peas tonight. Thought that maybe it was a strange combo, but it worked out very well. I would have liked more chilies though. Brussel Ssprouts  - check. 

No reservations tonight just a walk in party of four. Were told 2 hours for a table or we could get immediate seating outside on the patio? I still habe no idea how that happened, but on a high 70 degree no humidity night we could be immediately seated or wait two hours to sit inside? Never would happen in NYC.  Apparently Cleveland doesn't eat outside. 

Great service and many thanks to our server."}
{"text":"Delicious! My absolute favorite restaurant in Cleveland! It can be hard to get a reservation at times, unless you don't mind eating really late or early. But it is completely worth it! The atmosphere is quiet and smells delicious! My favorite dishes are the brussel sprouts and polenta- yum!!"}
{"text":"I go to Lolita pretty regularly, usually for happy hour on Fridays. Their happy hour cannot be beat, and apparently everyone knows it, because you have to show up at 4:45 or else you're not sitting at the bar. You must sit at the bar to get the happy hour specials, and you may have to fight a few people off for it. I can attribute this to the Lolita burger, my #1 favorite burger of all time- a juicy burg on a toasted English muffin, cheese, bacon, a fried egg and pickled red onion to top it off. You will not find a better burger in Cleveland, and at $5, I feel like I'm stealing from them. Get the roasted eggplant dip and some fried (in anchovy oil!) Brussels sprouts, and you've got yourself a meal.

Aside from the happy hour menu, I like to get one of the charcuterie boards for a snack, the roasted bone marrow for an appetizer, and the duck prosciutto pizza and duck confit are amazing entrees. The cocktails are delicious and creative. The service is always fantastic, especially if you are sitting at the bar. The bar manager somehow balances keeping everything clean, every drink refreshed, and is a super nice guy to boot. The location is excellent, you can almost always find street parking, and if not, valet is available. The decor inside is very home-y, very chic and somehow timelessly trendy. 

If you are vegan or veg, I would not recommend any Michael Symon restaurant. Most of his dishes are meat-centric, you will find very few things on the menu to accommodate you. But let's be serious here, he's the Iron Chef of Cleveland. He can get away with a lack of salad on his menu."}
{"text":"I went a few weeks ago with a friend. I really wanted to love it. The decor was awesome, lighting was perfect...seating looked nice...until we were sat. Our waiter was rude, not helpful, and was not busy. I got the mussels. They weren't bad.. weren't great.. the chorizo in the mussels was very bland. I could of made this dish at home.

I liked some of the other menu options but with such a unique menu and being rushed by our waiter we decided to just leave. Didn't even ask if we wanted drinks!"}
{"text":"After dining at many of Cleveland's finer establishments, I firmly believe Drew Carey was on to something when he proclaimed \"Cleveland Rocks!\"  He just should have prefaced it with...\"The restaurant scene of....\" 

Quite the little gem.  An open kitchen and lively bar scene set the tone for this more affordable Michael Symon creation.  Don't expect dishes as cautiously refined as Lola - but don't expect the price tag either.  This is the working wo/man's version and it delivers.

Make sure to stop in for happy hour where you can get Michael Symon's patented burger for $5.  Trust me, that is not a typo.  A top 5 burger of your life for $5.

Drive out of your way if you're ever in town."}
{"text":"I liked Lolita's--food was Ok, service was fine, however I had to scream over all the noise to talk to my friends. We were not all that close to the bar, but the acoustics are horrible.  I might wait awhile before going back..."}
{"text":"I've been to Lolita numerous times and never had a bad meal. The restaurant is one of my favorites in the area. The servers are quick and experienced. I love the duck confit and would highly recommend it. I would also recommend checking out some of the nearby shops. They have some pretty unique items."}
{"text":"We have been eating at Lolita since it opened.  Most recently the food and drinks have
been so disappointing.  If Michael Simon is not involved in this restaurant anymore, and
only has his name on the door -  he needs to let the public know.  After three subpar
meals we will not spend our money there again!"}
{"text":"Matt was my server. I think he's a manager. Total pro. Ask for him.

The food was delicious - definitely a great place to grab a nice, swanky dinner with a friend or two.

Some of the pictures here don't do the food justice. It's got really great presentation. More than that, the flavors and pairings are bold in a VERY good way.

Amazing. Will be coming back."}
{"text":"Lolita offers well executed if unspectacular dishes.  I don't mean this as a criticism -- I mean this more as a caution to those who are expecting a restaurant on the level of Chef Mike Symon's fellow Iron Chefs.  Lolita is not quite on the same plane as the restaurants of Batali, Morimoto, or even Flay -- but then again, that's never been what Mike Symon has been about.  Symon's specialty is straightforward, blue-collar fare cooked expertly.  If you're looking for more of an Iron Chef experience, head to Symon's flagship Lola in downtown Cleveland.

With that caveat out of the way, I was happy with my recent visit, if not blown away.  The food is good -- especially for the price -- but most of the dishes that I sampled will never make my top-ten list, with the possible exception of the bucatini, which took pulled pork to a new, unexpected level.  Otherwise, most of the dishes were solid but not transcendent -- the arugula salad, the mussels, the crudo, the lamb keftedes, the duck pizza, and the warm chocolate cake were all average to above-average.  The mixed drinks were also about average, and the service from the front of house to the waitstaff seemed like the farm league for Lola.

I'll most likely go back to Lola before I come back to Lolita.  3.5 stars, rounded up because of my love for Mike Symon."}
{"text":"My Lolita experience was somewhat bland compared to Humbert Humbert.  I had the macaroni with. Chicken and goat cheese.  The dish was good, cheese was excellent, chicken tender; however, the dish seemed to need something else.  Shared a meet tray with friends and seemed only two selections off of the tray were just okay.  Finished up dinner with a cheese tray which fell short of expectations compared to other cheese trays I have had in the past.  Four cheeses with only two items to pair with.  The truffle honey was very overpowering.

{"text":"Second time to Lolita tonight and met with hurry up service and two meals that were just completely overloaded with salt.  That was all you could taste.  My fiancée got the Soppressata pizza and I got the Buccatini pasta.  Ok, I realize we both got dishes with cured meats.  That said, there was absolutely no subtlety to these dishes - just a sledgehammer of sodium.  We did enjoy the spring salad, maybe a bit over dressed but otherwise a nice fresh start to our meal.  We were envisioning a nice little date night/special occasion after a long day at work - left feeling like we were putting everyone out for showing up 1.25 hrs before close. Considering all the options around, not sure this place still stacks up."}
{"text":"we went to lolita because of the good rating on yelp, however it did not meet with our expectation for this price. We ordered grilled squid, mussel, hanger steak with grilled brussels sprout and risotto. The mussel was fine but I have to say they were quite small. The most disappointed was the risotto which tasted bitter and weird. Brussels sprout was surprise, definitely worth trying it, but that was all. The steak was cooked perfect for medium well, but crispy and not worth it when comparing to the type of restaurant you are attending. Definitely expected more on the side of taste. Money and cost were not an issue and does not effect our opinions, but if having to choose between this restaurant and others, then go with others unfortunately. We really had high expectations."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I was very disappointed with my meal. The risotto was undercooked and salty, and the octopus was too fishy-tasting. The eggnog gelato had too much ginger and nutmeg. No way would I combine sage and cherry in a sorbet. I really enjoyed the chocolate stout and the atmosphere. The service was really good."}
{"text":"I'll cut to the chase and say that I love the food here... LOVE IT.. However... This is the 5th time we've been here and we will never sit in the dining area again... Our waitress was awful. Older blonde lady... Ignored us all night on a Sunday... We had reservations. They weren't slammed so I didn't understand... We sat for almost 40 minutes before she took our order. We ended up having to ask her if we could place our order because she wasn't taking it. And two minutes after it was sent in a guy came out with our food that obviously wasn't our order...  Never refilled our waters. Forgot to bring out the bread... Then ignored us the rest of the time and forgot our brussel sprout side. When she came back to give the dessert menu we had already been done for 20 minutes with nothing to drink and it was already 10:00... Highly disappointed. I recommend sitting at the bar... The bartender is awesome sauce... I definitely recommend the ceviche...bone marrow... And brussel sprouts. Mmmm...."}
{"text":"Let me begin with a disclaimer: I ate here because I'm a fan of Michael Symon. I've watched him for years on dozens of shows, and I particularly enjoyed his reign as Iron Chef. The guy just has a great approach to food: simplicity and fresh ingredients. But underneath that veneer, there's a highly trained chef who understands food (and the possibilities hidden within) on a deeper level. That's my opinion, of course, and you're welcome to dismiss me as the celeb-chef-obsessed fan who guzzles the lavender-infused Kool-Aid. 

That being said, while passing through Cleveland on a cross-country road trip, I knew I wanted to stop at one of Chef Symon's restaurants. Lola is pricey and fancy, not the kind of joint you want to roll into after twelve hours on the road. Lolita, on the other hand, is more casual and approachable. A few hours before our arrival, I made a reservation on OpenTable, which turned out to be a great idea for a Thursday night, since there was a wait once we arrived. 

We were promptly seated, and I was immediately struck by the warmth of the place. The open kitchen and staggered leveling of seating almost gives an air of intimate performance, as if the chefs and staff are playing to a crowd. Either that, or it just looks pretty cool. 

We started off with the Jonah Crab salad and roasted bone marrow, both delicate and delicious beyond compare. My one small gripe with the bone marrow, a substance I would eat daily if I had arteries of steel, was that the toppings (salsa verde and scallion) were a bit overwhelming on the delicate flavor of the marrow. Nevertheless, I controlled the amount of toppings in each bite, so that every mouthful would present itself with predominantly unctuous marrow goodness (\"unctuous\"... now there's an annoying word I picked up from watching too much food TV :)

For dinner, I had the homemade macaroni with chicken, goat cheese, and rosemary. Sounds simple right? Not exactly. There are a million ways to screw this dish up, but the chefs at Lolita found one of the only ways to make it right. The pasta was homemade, the chicken was succulently roasted thigh meat, the goat cheese was subtle yet tangy, and the rosemary brought the entire dish together. Four ingredients can be deceptively simple, but when executed at this level, they create a sublime chorus -- one of my all-time favorite pasta dishes ever (and I spent a great deal of time traveling throughout Italy). 

Sadly, we were in a rush to get back on the road (but also pretty full from the meal), so we paid the ridiculously inexpensive tab and left. Even though the meal was a quick stopover, I'll remember it for a lifetime... And not just because there's a sign right outside the restaurant that dedicates the intersection as \"Chef Symon Corner.\" Spearheading food operations like Lolita, the dude deserves such honors."}
{"text":"I went here with high expectations. Sadly I was very disappointed. Servings are so small for the high price you pay. The food isn't as good as it's reputation. I would say it's worth a trip to go to a 'Symon' restaurant, but I wouldn't return. Maybe one of his others are a little better."}
{"text":"Never had to wait this long for food in my life. We had reservations at 5:30 and sat down immediately. We ordered quickly within 5 min. The appetizer came 40 min later, which was a cold bean dip. Almost 1.5 hours from when we ordered, still no food. Told the waitress and was told the food would be out any minute. Eventually the manager came over to apologize and said the food would be right out. Well 15 minutes later the food came. The tables which were seated after us got there food before we got ours. We had theater tickets and ate a few bites and had it boxed. My wife really wanted the chocolate mousse and flour-less chocolate cake. She saw this on the website and was one of the reasons we went to Lolita. So we ordered when we got the food. The desserts came within 10 min along with the bill at full price. They ran my credit card and the manager came right when I was about to so sign the receipt. He ended up taking off the desserts at the last second.

We ate the entrees and desserts in 15 min. Over all the food was mediocre. We won't be going back, sorry Michael Simon."}
{"text":"This reveiw is only for happy hour which is a great treat - although be warned- the famed burger is no longer available and is not on the menu.  Several people stopped by while I was there to try the burger - served on an english muffin with a fried egg on top I am told- but they left wiping tears away as the server informed them it had been removed from the menu for a time.   No problem for me, I was there for the brussel sprouts which were totally deserving of a 4 star rating.  I think they were flavored with anchovies, walnutes, and a bit of cheese and fried to a crisp which brings out the sweetness and smokey flavor.  A vinager based sauce was at the bottem of the bowl and complemented the smokey sprouts perfectly.  I also tried the mac and cheese which was just ok to me-kinda dry and not enough sauce-although I could taste the potential of the goat cheese infused noodle dressing.  Service was friendly and prompt and with most items on the happy hour menu being priced around $5, a total deal.  Parking was a bit of a hassle so I avoided the valet and just parked on the street and walked a few blocks over.  Definately not a bad idea after eating all that food."}
{"text":"I have to update my review because I have come here for happy hour twice in the past two weeks and it is really good.

The happy hour menu has 4 drinks, and about 6 dishes.  The dishes are 5 dollars each and I believe all the drinks are 4 dollars.  You can order Mussels, Brussels Sprouts, Asparagus Dip, A burger with egg, half order of mac and cheese, and I believe olives with pickled onion.  I tried most of them.  The mac and cheese, burger, and Brussels Sprouts were my favorites.  

Our server both times has been this really nice girl.  I don't know her name but she has long blondish hair.  She is really sweet and attentive.  So I have upped my review of Lolita to 4 stars.  If parking weren't such a struggle in Tremont, it would be 5."}
{"text":"Decided to come here for my birthday diner with my husband. We were not disappointed! The service was wonderful! Water glasses were always full and when we asked our server for her favorites she gave us a fav in each category and why she liked it!

We started with crispy chicken livers and prosciutto. Both were great but the prosciutto was amazing. I had the sausage pizza omg! So good and was amazing reheated for breakfast! The brussel sprouts were great and had a little vinegar flavor at the end. My husband had the hanger steak and loved it. 

I will be going back for brussel sprouts and prosciutto!!!!"}
{"text":"Ah, TV. How powerful thou art. So powerful, a fraud from Cleveland can master the NYC art of charging 500 times what something is worth, and get away with it because teevee. Two words - quince paste. No one knows what the fuck that is, but obviously it makes your Vegas dice-sized cheese cube \"appetizer\" worth more than a 12-pack of Pabst. You will leave here not buzzed from the worst pours since the sacramental wine sip on your first communion, and hungry, so just be thankful you still have a nickel in your pocket."}
{"text":"On a trip to Cleveland decided to stop here since it was Micheal Symon's place. 

This was my second trip here and made sure i had reservations this time. Last time the place was full and i couldnt get a table until after 10 (i called at 6)

Now onto my meal and experience...

I went on a Saturday afternoon around 5pm.  They offered a Happy Hour menu which looks pretty good but i passed.  (saw the Hamburgers and wished i hadnt)

cocktail & appetizor:  Golden Friendship (rum, vermouth, amaretto, and ginger beer)...refreshing and made well.  $10 and a nice portion.   Roasted Bone Marrow
(never had this before but it was the BOMB.  Creamy and buttery.  Scrape the marrow out the bone and put on toasted chip and enjoy. I just wish there was MORE)

dinner:  Pork Chop dinner (served medium and grilled with nectarine mostarda, pickled fennel).  Pork Chop was seasoned well and cooked medium.  Not bad at all. I could do without nectarine probably would have preferred apples or apricot but it was still pretty good.  I ordered a side of the famous Brussel Sprouts (fried with anchovy, capers & walnut).  These were all people claimed them to be.  Finely seasoned and chared just right.  My only complaint is i would have liked them to be a little more tender. Im not a big fan of bussel sprouts but if fixed right i can enjoy them. 

dessert: Peach Amaretto Trifle:  Simply put:  Delicious.

Cocktail, Appetizor, Meal & Dessert for $51

final grade:   A-

The staff was top notch.  I cant rave enough about the service. Well trained on how to treat your guests.   If you know you are visiting Cleveland make sure you make a reservation to check out Lolita."}
{"text":"Wow!  Our trip to Lolita was great ......   Our pizza, with pickled green tomatoes, was incredibly, incredibly good.  Actually, and I hate to admit this...  it was the best thing we ordered.  The scallop special was also very good, not great, but very good.  My dining partner ordered a bone marrow appetizer, that would give a vegetarian nightmares.  I didn't have the courage to try it, but he tells me it was exceptional.

One tip - I was shocked how full this place was...   We arrived around 7 on a Friday night and were told there were no tables until 10:30pm, something which has never, never, happened to me in Cleveland.  Make reservations!"}
{"text":"We just dropped in on a Saturday evening thinking we might get a table...unfortunately it was booked until 10:30 pm... But we made the best of it by ordering a take out at the bar.
The Lolita Burger ($11) was not on the menu but they will make one for you if you ask for it. It was delicious and filling.
I also got a Sloppy Pizza ($14) that was average and a Bread pudding ($8) that was again really yummy.
There was also this beer - Gaffel Kolsch ($5) that I had two of while I waited, it does take some time to make the stuff I ordered as it was a full house but I waited maybe some 20 minutes and saw my food being made in front of my eyes... for which reason alone sitting at the bar was not a disappointment.
All of the staff I met were very helpful in telling me (because I asked ;)) what the other people were ordering and what it was made of as I could see some really sophisticated stuff being made, right in front of me.
The Cons to this place if you ask me are the prices are not cheap and they have a limited selection of beer and seating capacity.
Overall good food, great ambience, and helpful staff - I give it a 3.5 outta 5."}
{"text":"Went of a night on the town this restaurant is over rated and not for the average couple.  Drinks were good but food was not appealing ... Drink your drink and move on down the street."}
{"text":"This place failed to live up to the hype for me.

I started with the Apiary cocktail; lavender infused gin and Ohio honey. The lavender was uppercutting my palette it was so strong.
 
I also tried the bone marrow, which was good, but the amount hardly warranted the four toast points it came with.
 
The last thing I got was the cheese board, which came with more toast points, a condiment cup of candied nuts, five cherries, a condiment cup of berry rhubarb compote, and three cheeses. One of the cheeses was a blue cheese, which I wasn't thrilled about, but I tried it and it was ok. The menu doesn't tell you which cheeses are being offered, so it would've been smarter of me to ask before I ordered. 

That being said, if you don't like the cheeses being offered you'll probably have to pick something else, because I doubt they will switch them out. Another person in the group asked if it was possible to add chicken to one of the pizzas, and we might as well had asked how long a piece of string was. Such was the clarity of the answer we got from the waitress. My partner got the mac & cheese and it was pretty good, although I found it to be a little heavy on the rosemary. My friend got the chicken livers and they were excellent. They also forgot her order of potatoes but ended up comping her for them. So that was nice."}
{"text":"I liked Lolita.  I wouldn't say that my head exploded with awesomeness and bliss (which I kind of expected, from everything I'd heard), but I would say that it's worth checking out. 

We had a reservation but had to wait 30 minutes for our table to be available which was kind of annoying (especially since the small restaurant didn't have an easy place to wait).  Once we were seated, however, the irritation started to melt away.  Our server was fun and funny and informative, the wine list was impressive, and it was pretty cool to watch the meals come out of the open kitchen at the front of the room.  In addition, the menu was small but diverse, and the food was really tasty.  I had the \"Macaroni\" (goat cheese, rosemary, chicken) and it was rich and delicious -- and too much for one person.  And all of the other meals I snuck bites of were also very tasty.

I definitely recommend checking this place out, but maybe with lowered expectations -- and on a week night."}
{"text":"We went to Lolita again for Happy Hour on a Wednesday night. We got cocktails ($5 each), the lolita burger, the 1/2 mac n' cheese, and the chocolate pot du creme. Everything was excellent - the dessert was like a hot, slightly salted chocolate pudding - delicious! Go for happy hour - they'll seat you in the comfortable entrance nook with all the pillows and the food is dirt cheap - I think our bill was around $25 for all that food!"}
{"text":"By now most people are pretty aware of who Michael Symon is and what he does...makes unbelievable delicious food! His understanding of food is almost shocking. Whether it's Lola, Lolita, b spot, etc...you're going to be happy when you leave a restaurant of his and excited to go back"}
{"text":"A neat restaurant in Tremont. I had the duck confit, which was quite tender and flavorful. The fried brussels sprouts are the best thing on the menu-- I've never before eaten brussel sprouts that I enjoyed. Reserations are recommended, as this place is fairly popular but on the smaller side. If you can, come for happy hour early, as the bar fills up quickly."}
{"text":"Had the Duck Prosciutto pizza. The only reason I gave it a 4 star instead of a 5 is because I didn't think the pizza was anything special. It's not that it was bad at all, I just didn't feel like it had a lot of flavor. I was there with 11 other people and the service was excellent and I know the others at my table enjoyed their food. We were there on a Tuesday so they had the pork roast going on, I was told that was good, as was the squash ravioli. I've heard the hanger steak is good but the best way to eat it is medium to medium rare so be aware that your meat will be pink.

I'd definitely go back, will just try something other than Duck Prosciutto pizza."}
{"text":"Every time I go to Cleveland Lolita is a must visit. Each visit has been better than the last with unbelievable food and equally impressive service. Favorites for me are the Bone Marrow app, Roasted Chicken and Macaroni."}
{"text":"Went for a friends bday party. It was awesome, they had booked the private room above Lolita and the party had a private chef with a kitchen right there while we had appetizers and cocktails. As one appetizer disappeared the chef had another one freshly made of something else new. The server/bartender had a station right there to help keep everyones libations refilled. When it was time to eat we sat at a large table for 16 and we had a downsized menu with choice of soup/salad course, 3 different main courses and 2 options for dessert, once we placed our orders we were able to see the chef stat to work immdiately on our dinners. It was a really nice evening. I would definetly keep that in mind if I ever need something for a small party."}
{"text":"Ordered: meat sampler, duck, and chocolate cake. 

All of the food was perfectly cooked, and some of the best I've ever had. The sampler was thoroughly explained by our waitress (which was much appreciated). She had a thorough knowledge of the dishes, and of the drinks as well. 

The restaurant itself had a very good atmosphere. I most enjoyed the lighting, which consisted of exposed bulbs with a loosely coiled filament.

Overall, one of the best meals I've ever had."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Lolita, but I just don't get what all the buzz is about. Sadly, I was not impressed. A group of 4 of us went there for a late dinner around 8 on a Wednesday night. You wouldn't think they would have that much trouble fitting us in at that time, but even though we had made reservations almost 2 weeks in advance, we had to wait almost 20 minutes to be seated. By the way, an actual waiting area would be nice instead of the tiny space between the door and the hostess station. And don't even think about finding a seat at the bar-- impossible.  Anyway, once we were seated and had ordered, our drinks arrived a bit later than we felt they should have. Out appetizer, roasted eggplant dip, was very good and was the only part of our meal that was delivered in a timely fashion. We must have waited almost 45 minutes for our entrees. 3 out of the 4 people in out party ordered the mushroom crusted sirloin, one ordered the pork chop.  All 3 of the steaks were not cooked to the temperatures they were ordered. Two of us sent our steaks back. The server seemed annoyed with this and I felt like I was bothering her by asking for a steak which was not over cooked. (It wasn't until after our checks came that she finally apologized for the steaks not being cooked to the correct temperature. At no point did anyone apologize or acknowledge the wait to be seated or the wait for our entrees.) Anyway, by the time our sides were delivered they were lukewarm, but nonetheless the polenta I ordered was still very good. I tasted the brussel sprouts and the cauliflower and they were also very good. Anyway, my real disappointment was when my second steak was delivered to the table and it still tasted like it wasn't properly cooked. I'm no professional chef, but I shouldn't have to tell the Iron Chef how to properly cook a steak. My sirloin tasted almost microwaved or steamed...like it wasn't cooked on a hot enough grill and they just kind of gently and slowly heated it up.  Not seared at all, and very tough and chewy. Even though I understand sirloin isn't the most tender cut of beef, for $22 I'd rather have and Outback Special or 2 sirloins from Applebees (I'm not even joking about Applebees. It was that sub-par.) The flavor was ok, but the texture was just everything a good steak should NOT be...chewy, steamed, awful. Over all, if the service had been better I could have excused the poor quality of the steak, or vise versa. I understand this may have been an exceptionally busy night the week during the holiday season, but I just wasn't impressed. Its a shame too because the food at B-Spot in Strongsville is delicious every time for half the price and a quarter of the wait time. I really think Michael Symon can do better than this."}
{"text":"Guys. This place is seriously over-rated. And that's only because it's a \"Michael Symon' restaurant. The average person will not like the menu, ambivalence or service. The menu is super random, with things like quail and other things the average person doesn't eat. The service was sparse. The entree took 60 minutes to arrive at our table. And the food was just ok -- we ordered the salami charcuterie plate, the flank steak, and the sausage pizza. The only redeeming menu item was the brussel sprouts. Not worth it."}
{"text":"through the years, dinner on my birthday has been a significant event.  for my seventh birthday, i had my birthday party at the fine establishment of mcdonalds.
best birthday party ever.

years 8-10 were spent at the popular chain of fridays.  i mean, who could resist the elaborate steak-on-a-stick dinner with a salad?  certainly not pre-pubescent me.

years 11-13 were spent at the hoyty-toyty establishment of ponderosa.  and each year i'd act surprised as i rounded the corner in the restaurant and my extended family appeared at a table in a surprise party fashion to wish me birthday happiness.

dinners for birthdays are a big deal for my family.  and this year was a big birthday.  so i wanted something special.

i planned out my 30th bday in a very detailed manner.  and at six pm, my family and a few close friends and i had dinner reservations at lolita.

i have to say...for all the hype lolita and lola are getting in clevo right now, i wasn't blown away by amazingness.

i mean, it wasn't horrible by any sense of the word.  and i give mad props to michael symon.  it makes me feel good that a hometown boy is makin' good.

perhaps i'm a little too hick to deal with the trendy trendsters place such as lolita.  and trendy it is.  the staff is coiffed and poised, and you feel as if you've been transported to a corner elegant bistro somewhere downtown manhattan rather than cleveland's trendy tremont.

example of trendiness? how about their wine tap.  Fancy.Pants.  my friend ordered a glass of wine and the stemless wine glass was delivered to the table with a little creamer carafe of wine that the server poured elegantly.  oooooooh. smell you, fancy pants delivery of vino.

the food?  not too shabby.  half the things on the menu my mom had to ask what they were.  yep.  we're from the country. mcdonalds. fridays. ponderosa. shut up.

we got three of the current appetizers.  the almond and garlic appetizer was pretty good.  the bruscetta was delicious.  i didn't go for the beets but the 'rents and additional fam loved them.

my friend ordered the ravioli with butternut squash and had to send it back because it was actually luke warm to cold.  they immediately made up some more and it was nice and hot.  i ordered the roasted chicken and brussel sprouts.  i guess what can you do with a roasted chicken.  nothing special, but it was pretty good.  the macaroni my other friend got looked darn good, and i was sad i didn't order that.  my mom's steak was a bit tough, but pretty to look at.  i can't remember what else the fam got but it was alright.

overall, tasty enough, but not worth the hype.  and for all the hype, we shouldn't have had to send any food back.

but a pretty good birthday dinner to enter into a new decade, if i do say so myself.  the best bday dinner i've had.

eat your heart out, mcfridayosa."}
{"text":"After reading several reviews, went a little early to get to happy hour at Lolita. Ended up getting seats at the bar & stayed for the full 1.5 hrs. Started off with the margarita-martini which was good and strong. Continued on to try the Beta, which I thought was was the perfect combination of ginger and lime juice. 

As for food, we started with the mussels. Seriously, chorizo on the mussels? Michael Symon and I must have been separated at birth. Dip a little bread into the luxurious liquid from the mussels and you have experienced heaven. The fried brussel sprouts were unlike any I have ever tasted. Perfectly crisp and rich, I wish I was eating them now. 

We continued happy hour with the 1/2 mac and cheese. I loved the combination of goat cheese, rosemary & chicken. Kinda wish I would've ordered the full order but I digress. Our last dish was the chickpea dip. Very simple, but once again divine. Creamy and delicious.

Go to Lolita and get there a little early for happy hour. Great food and amazing prices! Kudos to Chef Symon-will be back again for my next roadtrip to Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Located on Literary Road at the Michael Symon block in Tremont, Lolita is not to be missed for a meal if you are in Cleveland.  This is serious eats in what I can only describe as serious foodie town.  Whoever said that Cleveland is the \"mistake by the lake\" obviously had not eaten at Lolita.

I went for happy hour, although anytime would be happy!  Great deals for top shelf food.  I had the Lolita burger.  Juicy goodness on an English muffin for $5.  Also for $5 had the 1/2 mac and cheese made with goat cheese, chicken and rosemary.  Pair this with a happy hour drink special and it can't be beat.

Service was a bit snooty, but I just ignored my uninterested server once I went into my food coma.  If you want more attentive service, come with a group and not for happy hour.  But as I was travelling alone, this was a perfect option for me."}
{"text":"Hooray! I finally went back to Lolita and had my redemption experience.

A bunch of ladies went out last night for a going-away dinner for a friend. At first I was annoyed that my husband was frying bacon before I left and was worried that I smelled like bacon. However, I should have remembered that duh, this is Michael Symon! The whole restaurant smells like bacon. So I fit right in.

Our server, named Rachel, was great and was extremely attentive. We never had to wait for any drink refills or to be asked if/when we'd like more food.

Our table of six split the roasted beets - FAR more delectable than I remember them! and the chick pea purree with flatbread. Delicious. Oh, also, I think they might put crack in the olive oil. I stole someone else's piece of bread so I could have a second piece with which to --dare I say it? -- luxuriate in the olive oil a little longer.

Not wanting to mess with greatness, I ordered the Mac and cheese with goat cheese, chicken and Rosemary. I will ALWAYS order this from now on!!! After having it at Bar Symon, I knew about how good it was.

I also enjoyed a glass of reisling (can't remember the name, but it was $8) to go with everything.

All in all, a great dinner and I am so glad I went back. Oh, and I almost forgot--our party witnessed a proposal firsthand!!! That was insane. The whole restaurant clapped for them...it was totally out of a movie or something. Their server brought them a celebratory dessert with a candle and two glasses of champagne. Cute and classy!"}
{"text":"Came here for the happy hour and it is unbelievable.  An amazing big burger for $5 and also got an order of mussels and chorizos for another $5.  An incredibly filling dinner for $10.  Only caveat is that it can get crowded during happy hours and the bar only seats about 15."}
{"text":"We had a FAB meal here!  Dined with a few folks and we ordered a bunch of sides/apps to share family style.  Favorites: charred eggplant dip, soft polenta, fried brussels sprouts, roasted marrow and pig ears and tails.  Fried okra was ok, but I've spent half my life in the south, so hard for a Greek Yank to beat what I've had in MS, AL, GA or the Carolinas.  ;)  I can't wait to get back to order the charred eggplant dip and polenta!"}
{"text":"Usually not a big fan of handing out 5 out of 5, but I really can't think of anything that would have improved my wife and I's experience visiting Lolita ..... hostess was friendly, wait staff service was awesome and didn't rush us through dinner, and the food was AMAZING !!  

Great atmosphere , give Lolita a shot!"}
{"text":"After hearing the hype we had to check this place out. Overall was a great experience. The hanger steak was perfectly cooked and the balsamic vinaigrette reduction had excellent flavor. We also had the rabbit ravioli which was a very unique dish that came together perfectly. Very tasty. Also, the polenta side was the best polenta I think I've ever had. There were only two things I had reservations about- I ordered their ginger-vodka drink and it tasted like weak gin and tonic. Also the plates were a pretty small, I have a large appetite so I would have had to order many more dishes to be full."}
{"text":"Do NOT order the Pork Gnocchi. It was incredibly disappointing.  What was in my plate could fit in my palm. Not an exaggeration. When I saw what the waiter put in front of me, I thought you have got to be kidding me. I grew up on Long Island in an Italian house so I know a thing about gnocchi. These were cooked to a mush. They were like little balls of mashed potatoes. My wife gave me half of her chicken (which was excellent)."}
{"text":"We went to Lolita last night with my parents and it did not disappoint.  This is one of our favorite restaurants and we were very happy to share the experience with my parents.

We started with bruschetta (mom and me), chicken livers (dad) and bone marrow (husband).  Everyone enjoyed their choices.  My dad said those were the best chicken livers he's ever had.  The brushetta was so fresh, flavorful and delicious.  Highly recommend.

Next were the entrees- fish (me), buccatini (mom and husband), duck (dad).  All were excellent.  I LOVE the buccatini, but was in the mood for something lighter last night so the fish was a great choice- halibut with peas, radish, lemon.  Everyone really enjoyed all the choices.

We were too full for dessert this time.  Love it here...always so good!"}
{"text":"Ok, this place is just awesome!  Had salami board with 3 homemade sausage samples. Really good. Dinner was macaroni husband had sausage pizza and we had fried Brussel sprouts. All just amazing!!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"i lived in cleveland for three years, and i miss nothing more than a friday happy hour burger and beer at lolita.  

dont think about the fact that its owned by an iron chef (michael symon); look past the hip staff and cool work shirts the chefs wear, in plain site, at the open kitchen next to the bar; and who cares about sitting inside a beautifully lit, warmly appointed atmosphere that feels homey and glamourous all at the same time (who doesnt love exposed filament bulbs?); focus, on the food

i havent been there in almost a year and half, so i wont begin to talk about what is on their menu, as it changed so often, im sure ive not had a thing (yay for keeping it fresh!).  but ive had a lot of their dishes, and without a doubt, whatever sounds good to you, is amazing, so go ahead and order it!

the mac and cheese, the fried egg kobe burger, and everything with pork have always been my standards...you wont have a better burger, ever.  

and please, save room for dessert...mr. symons secret weapon is his ability to cultivate talent...one such person is corey barret, his pastry chef...amazing.  get one of whatever they offer. enjoy. youll thank me later"}
{"text":"Since writing this review I've been back several times.  Here's the ticket:

Get the \"Big Board\" charcuterie.  Add a cheese plate (only listed on the dessert menu - a nice rec from our bartender.  More on him momentarily).  With this, order a sherry or big bold red (I had an amazing pinot noir that, while pricey, was one of the best glasses of wine I've ordered in a long time).

Sitting at the bar is my thing, as I've mentioned before.  The bartender at Lolita is the absolute BEST I have ever had.  Knows his stuff.  Not just what's good, but how everything is prepared, processed, where it's sourced from, and the best equipment to use while cooking.  So I ask a lot of questions...so what!  Visit this man.  Visit him often.  Leave happy."}
{"text":"When people ask me \"where should I eat in Cleveland?\" I generally say \"Lola, Greenhouse Tavern, Red Steakhouse or Light Bistro. I have to add Lolita to the mix for my favorite after this last experience.  

The beet salad with Marcona almonds was fresh and flavorful with small blood orange segments (I think?)

The Brussel sprouts, which I remembered being great before, exceeded my memory. Who knew they would be so great with anchovy, capers, walnuts and vinegar? What? Yes!

The fusilli with lamb, bread crumbs and orange was in the top five pasta dished I have ever had.  This type of thin long noodle al dente fusilli was perfection.  The lamb was. It ground but more of a pulled lamb. I added some grated cheese I asked for and it put it over the top. Man, oh man.  This dish was dynamite."}
{"text":"Happy hour is the best. Lolita Burger, Brussels Sprouts, and a Bad Day Bourbon (BDB)."}
{"text":"the food was absolutely delicious, although the selection is small. the wine list is pretty solid though, and service was very good."}
{"text":"Michael Symon's restaurant didn't leave me disappointed on my 1st trip there. Risotto with rabbit was  delish! Polenta with parmesan and marscapone  (sp?) cheeses was creamy and rich! And finally, the vastly talked about roasted brussel sprouts were out of this worldI Made with walnuts and anchovies! I was quite full from the risotto, but couldn't stop eating the sprouts! They were that good! I was expecting our check to be a lot higher, but was pleasantly surprised that my guess on the total was a lot higher than the total. But the place still is pricey! Great place for a special occasion!"}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and had eaten at Lola earlier in the month, it was more formal but delicious.   I loved the ambiance here better, Nestled away in a cute neighborhood.  Started with the eggplant dip...AWESOME, review would be 5 stars if that is all I had.  Even if your not an eggplant lover, I think you would enjoy this, is was silky smooth with a smokey lemony flavor.  Hard to explain but yummy.  For dinner I got a risotto special with ramps/english peas/ morrels and some cheese(don't remember name) good, but rich, glad you were able to order an appetizer portion.  Also got a side of brussell sprouts, but they were not my favorite, a little too salty for MY taste.  The Manhattan Project cocktail was wonderful.  Next time I'm in town, would probably go back to Lola before Lolita, partially because of convenience."}
{"text":"Two years later and I'm a back. 
Food was great and drinks were inventive. 

This time I had:

the appetizer special. 
Sous vide of pork belly with grilled peaches and micro greens with chanterelles and some drizzle I cannot remember. 
The flavors were great but the temperature seemed inconsistent in the peaches, some were out right cold. 

Sopressata pizza:
Had a nice crust and really yummy cheese. The huge discs of sopressata were hard to bite into with out pulling them off the slice, but they tasted great. The peppers were HOT but I liked the way they played off the basil etc. 

I'll be back"}
{"text":"Chef Symon's \"other place\" is in the old Tremont neighborhood, the \"near west side\" just across the river from Cleveland. Street parking can be difficult so I suggest using valet after 6:00PM on any weekend night. The tables are close together, so intimate conversations are out of the question. Great for general dates where the closeness of other tables and background music can compensate for awkward moments.

As often the case with fine restaurants, the menu is small, but there isn't a bad choice in the bunch. Food is tasty and nearly compares with Symon's primary restaurant, Lola's, located in downtown Cleveland. I say \"nearly compares\" but I've not ordered identical dinners, so perhaps it's only my perception that Lolita's cuisine isn't quite as packed with exotic flavors as Lola's. Nevertheless, Symon has done an excellent job with the menu, limited as the options may be."}
{"text":"Lolita is one of those restaurants where you can close your eyes, point to anything on the menu, and be 100% satisfied with your order.  It's a rustic, intimate ambience with an open kitchen, adding that modern vibe catering to a sleek crowd.

I came on a Wednesday night with three others and I was surprised to see how busy it was!  The four of us decided to order a bunch of plates to share and in my opinion, it's the best way to go about your dining experience here.  There wasn't a single dish we had that wasn't absolutely delicious.  We ordered the mussels, eggplant dip, mushroom pizza, tagliatelle, and fried brussels sprouts.  For dessert we had the dark chocolate panna cotta and that too was amazing.

I was also really impressed with the service at Lolita.  Our waitress was very attentive and friendly, so it's another perk added to the overall experience.  From decor to food and everything in between, I am very impressed with this restaurant."}
{"text":"My Second Favorite Restaurant in Cleveland..Great Food atmosphere nice ..but too small of establishment. Service okay depends on what time of day..it was a Sunday after a Browns game a bit late closer to Closing time when we arrived and our server was in a bit hurry..Also waited a few minutes for our table and got a bit too hot from the Oven next to the Bar.. Can imagine on a hot summer day that ooooven..overall great and be back soon.!!"}
{"text":"You ever have way too high of expectations for a restaurant and then have to figure out how to even rank on Yelp because you know your expectations were out of whack.
Maybe if I sat at the bar and ordered apps during Happy Hour,  would have walked away singing its praises.  Instead I left with a dent in my wallet and only one really positive thing to say.

\"Side of Brussel Sprouts were yum and worth $5\"  If there will ever be a next time, I think I would do an app with a side of Brussel Sprouts.  I don't really like Brussel Sprouts but I read the reviews and went for it.  They also made a quite tasty mixed drink for my wife but at $10 it should be tasty.

The Rest of my experience:  Hangar Steak for $25 which came with a side.  It was ok but not great.  It seemed to be nice and pink in the middle but some of the edges were a little more charred and chewy for my taste.  It is pretty dark in there so I couldn't tell you exactly what the colors looked like.  My wife wasnt impressed with the menu and decided to play it safe with the Mac N Chese for around $16 or so.  This MacN cheese was gritty and bland.  I don't know how they can charge that much for this dish.  Don't be boring when you come here.  I would recommend ordering the apps and sides and leave the entrees to us dumb newbies.  I did have an opportunity to see the people eating the pizza beside us but I wouldn't want to come here and get pizza as I am not a thin, crunchy crust fan.  Their one pizza was burnt on the edges as well.  I am sure Michael Symon is a great chef but he doesn't cook to my tastes.  I probably should stay with my ethnic eateries over American cuisine.

Service was great as our waiter was very knowledgeable. We came 20 minutes before our reservation and walked around the neighborhood until about 5 till and got our seats in about 3 minutes.  No trouble with parking on a Saturday night around 7."}
{"text":"Fantastic!  Mussels with chorizo rocked my world!  Great looking place and awesome service compliment the food well.

{"text":"Cant think of better way to spend some family time in the Tremont area of Cleveland.  Perfect happy hour with welcoming bar staff."}
{"text":"No question about it -- best pork chops I've ever had. The brussels sprouts were also well-seasoned & tasted amazing.  

The waiter was very attentive & kind and quick to recommend dishes - It's always frustrating when they can't steer you in any direction... 

I definitely want to go back. Soon."}
{"text":"My boyfriend brought me here back in April for my birthday and I have to say it was amazing! We had the pig ears and tails for an appetizer. This is the reason I'm giving it a 4 star instead of 5. The ears were delicious... Super crispy! The tails were really fatty and i felt we didnt get much meat since it was so fatty.
We both got the hanger steak which was cooked beautifully. I ended up switching my sides with him since i ordered the broccolini and it turned out to be rather spicy(something i may have missed when ordering). The brussels sprouts were pretty good. I'd love to go back and try out some of the other menu items!"}

- Vladimir Nabokov

So, Lolita is the super sensual girl I spent with but only one (hot) night. I'd like to change this from a one-night stand into a prolonged love affair, but alas, I live in Chicago. For now I'm content just knowing that she forever changed my life. 

And how so? She got me eating brussel sprouts... and loving them! The nutritional qualities are probably long gone once they're fried and fried deep, but the combination of chopped brussel sprouts, anchovies, capers, garlic, walnuts, honey and chilies was... well, like when Michael Corleone gets hit by the lightning bolt, meeting his Apollonia. Real love, not infatuation.

Additionally, I shouldn't gloss over their wonderful wine and craft beer list, their fit-for-the-foodiest-of-foodies kobe burger, or their attentive service and chic insides.

Don't forget, Lolita: I will love you forever more, forever more."}
{"text":"Lolita definitely gets an A+ for atmosphere. I love trendy Tremont spots and Lolita does not dissapoint in this department.

Only bad part which is also a good part is that the kitchen is right out in the open. When we arrived (around 7:30 for our reservations) it was a bit hot in the restaurant and it seemed poorly ventilated, my hair definitely left smelling like food and a bit of grease.

The menu changes a bit with seasonal items (or so it seemed comparing the menu online to the one we reviewed in restaurant), which is very fab. I love when restaurants use locally sourced ingredients. 

So, here - I'm going to admit it, my palate isn't refined enough for this place. While I definitely enjoyed my meal - there was very few items on the menu I was willing to try. I just couldn't think about stomaching anything containing or crusted with \"bone marrow\" - just couldn't. Crispy Pig Tails and Ears? Nope, couldn't do that either. Crispy Chicken Livers, no. Duck Meatballs? Maybe, but I was scared.

An item I must suggest and so does basically eveyrone else that eats there are the brussel sprouts... they're serve fried with capers, anchovies, and walnuts and I know at least I thought - what? Really? But, yes - they're fab. My dinner selection was roasted chicken and it was divine, the toppings locally sourced and in season. The boyfriend's selection was the macaroni and cheese (it's goat cheese) and he loved it. Again, my unrefined palate was my enemy - goat cheese just tastes plain musty to me!

As far as bevvies go - I got a Thin Lizzy (stonefruit vodka, dolin blanc, champagne, and mint), it was not bad except that the week before I had an awful experience with wine power hour (DO NOT ATTEMPT) and the drink tasted a bit too wine-esque for me to handle. I ended up leaving it half full.

I'll definitely be back again in an attempt to mature my palate by trying new things, and oh - because its a short walk to Churned (mmmm... ice cream!)."}
{"text":"7/3/2013, arrived @ 8pm w/ no reservation & was informed of 30 min. wait on a Wednesday night, no problem, we decided to take a walk, checkout the neighborhood and came back 20 mins. later. Came back and The hostess took a look at us and seemed dismayed that we returned,NO SMILE, NO GREETING, NO NOTHING, JUST A BLAH LOOK ON HER FACE, in fact, she was mute. 

She picked up 3 menus & started to walk away; we assumed we were to follow... After seating, a very nice waitress took our order. It was another 30 mins before our food arrived. I had the mushroom pizza which was okay, and the fried Brussels sprouts, which were black from being burnt and drenched in so much grease. 

The gnocchi and sausage was so small, a 10 year old would've starved. There were about 4-5  tiny sausage meatballs the size of a quarter and a handful of gnocchi. My son had the macaroni and chicken, however, there were only a few slivers of chicken to be eaten, although the dish was tasty.  

The busboy was so eager to clear our table, while I was still eating my last slice of pizza, he removed my plate while I was holding the pizza. I felt rushed and unwelcome. Too bad for Michael Symon, the service and hospitality was dismal. The portions erratic and way too loud music.  

Also, kinda odd, bartender, busboy, cooks, all had beards, at least 5-6 guys walking around w/ beards . Also, no one offered us refills on our drinks. Dessert was flour less chocolate granache w/ cherry sauce. It was gooey and almost runny, I did not go for a second bite.

I've met Michael Symon on The Chew, so the next time I get a chance, I'll let him know what lousy hospitality and service I got and the so so food. Very disappointed in Lolita and Cleveland! (see my review on Lola)."}
{"text":"Honestly, I expected much more for the price and the 'reputation' as a Michael Symon restaurant. Everything we ordered was only so-so. The bread wasn't even warm and fresh. Mushroom pizza was eh..I've had better pizza for 1/2 the price. We wanted the crispy pig ears but they were out. The goat cheese mac and cheese was good but again...not worth $17. The chicken liver was also good but not impressive. 

In summary, I expected an explosion of goodness with each dish and every bite...but instead got the feeling like when you expect your pop rocks to really crackle...but they don't. 

Probably would not return again."}
{"text":"Food is excellent, otherwise it wouldn't rate much at all in my book. Total disclosure, I'm vegetarian and this is not the place to go as a vegetarian. I don't even find them particularly accommodating. Many of the sides have bacon or lardo cooked into them so it isn't even a matter of leaving things off. So why have I been there 4 or 5 times? Because my partner eats meat and really enjoys it. What little they offer that is meat free has been delicious.

My biggest gripe that some other reviewers have also noted is the service. Management really needs to do something about this. There is no excuse to be charging the prices they are and offering the quality of food they are with so little regard to service. It's one thing to have casual service and another to be inattentive and disinterested. Dining out is about the total experience. I've eaten here 4 or 5 times and the service has never risen to the level of this place's reputation. It's more along the line of a college beer joint. Get it together guys."}
{"text":"It's good to be back in Cleveland.  Wasn't sure I'd be able to say that especially since it hasn't stopped precipitating over the past three days.  But oh, Lolita, like a dirty little vixen, you make these dreary thoughts melt away.
Bone marrow appetizer.  Wasn't sure what to expect but the bone fat food pleases me. Duck comfit entree with creamy Polenta.  The juicy dark meat makes me salivate upon seeing daffy duck.  And finally the chicken & goat cheese macaroni provided me a taste of what the believers call heaven.
Service was great, the Symon Says cocktail really hit the spot and I'm glad to see this place hasn't skipped a beat."}
{"text":"Made reservations for our wedding anniversary two days in advance and was thankful that they had their VIP table open at no extra charge; and was flattered when someone obviously more important (ie a British chef who was in for some Food Network show) was in the restaurant and we got the head table! Kudos to their GM for making us feel extra special for the night!
We have been before and knew what the expect.. and well, our expectations were certainly met.
Apps: Proscuitto Cured Meat Plate & Mussels; both delicious  but portions are quite large... more than we could finish knowing what was coming next
Entrees: Flank Steak and Lamb Gnocchi. Delicious in every way. Perfectly cooked and flavored beautifully.
Dessert: Chocolate Cake...... Holy Chocolate Cake is what they should call it.. LOVE. And I do not even like Chocolate.
Throw in two beers, a glass of champagne, a glass of wine and a Redbrest 12 .....you'd think at a Michael Symon restaurant our bill would be astronomical but we were pleasantly surprised when it ended up being just over $96- wow. Symon has a true gem here; great food at a great price point with a fantastic atmosphere."}
{"text":"I must say, I was very impressed with Lolita. It has been years since I have been here. With so many options in the area, Lolita has been overlooked by me. My wife wanted to go to Lolita for her birthday so I agreed. 
The service was fantastic. No sense of rushing, water glasses always filled. Quick to check to make sure everything was perfect. One of my biggest pet peaches is when I ask for a recommendation and they tell me everything is great. Our server made good recommendations, even if we didn't order them. 
For appetizers, we had the chicken livers and prosciutto. Had my wife's nail lady not recommended the livers, we would never have ordered them. I'm glad she was told to try them. They were fantastic. The prosciutto was amazing. We could eat that and the brussel sprouts and be totally content. 
Entrees were the sausage pizza and the hanger steak. I've had the hanger steak numerous times at Lola and it's very similar. I did miss the Lola fries but the side veggies were yummy. 
Overall, had a great experience and we plan on making it a point to try it again soon. 
Oh, one thing I was surprised about. No specials. Well, a soup, but no entree specials. Not a big deal since I probably would done the hanger steak anyway, but was surprised."}
{"text":"Very good. Chicken livers to start and goat cheese Mac and Cheese for the entree. Pizza is pretty damn good as well. 

Pricing is decent and atmosphere works for. If you're in Cleveland worth checking out"}
{"text":"Get the pigs ears and tails! Pasta had small portions steak was a fair size and delicious. Service was wonderful. Only thing I wasn't a fan of was the potatoes"}
{"text":"I'm going to start off by saying, I loved everything I tried here and that doesn't happen often! Everything from the duck meatballs and roasted dates to my main entree, which was Gnocchi (can't get enough of it), it was all delicioso. 

I came here after work and although we sat in the main dining area, the bar area was definitely hopping! They seem to have a great happy hour also, so I'll be back to explore more of their food and drinks soon. 

Note: You should always give yourself a few minutes to find a spot when coming here, the street parking fills up fast!"}
{"text":"Usually I am not fully impressed with trendy restaurants that are considered hot on the scene. But I have to say that I had an amazing meal at Lolita. Everything was tasteful, including the best brussels sprouts I have ever had. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"The Mrs. and I frequent Lolita very often. Which is a good thing, but sometimes a let down. Don't get me wrong the plates are delicious, but seldom rotate enough to warrant subsequential trips. The menu is often pretty static and I would look to Lolita to make more dynamic updates (outside of specials) in the future. 

This wouldn't be an issue, except the menu is so limited. There are really 5 - 7 apps, 5 - 6 entrees, 5 - 6 pizzas, 2 - 3 pastas. 

Beer available = amazing. Drinks = fantastic. Location = fun and lots to do around the area. 

Must orders: Bone marrow. Yes, do it now! It is to die for!"}
{"text":"FANTASTIC!!! Food, service & ambiance are top notch! Menu is full of local, scrumptious ingredients that are prepared superbly! Get your reservations a few days in advance if you want a prime time dinner slot. We will be going back soon!!!"}
{"text":"Lolita is a great place to go for dinner. Just make sure you layer your clothing. The pizza oven makes the restaurant unbearably hot. I wished I had sat near the front door rather than at the bar. That is the only negative comment I can make about this establishment. 

I had the fusilli with lamb. It was awesome. Not too salty! The pasta was aldente. The rhone wine was terrific. The service was great. And the restaurant is in a cool neighborhood. 

If I lived in Cleveland, I would go back again and again to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Great, just friggin' great. Got a bunch of aps, (Bone marrow= some of the best I've had, and I get it everywhere I go that has it) a pizza with Tallegio and mushrooms, and a pasta dish, angelotti stuffed with carrot and a rabbit ragout. Everything was spot on. Michael Simmon is an incredible chef, period. Overall, an excellent, more casual alternative to Lola."}
{"text":"Qualifier - I have only ever eaten here for Happy Hour...

... but I've had their happy hour countless times.

The early happy hour starts at 5p... and it's not a bad idea to be there a few minutes before.  There has been more than one occasion where the seats at the bar are completely taken (although anyone who goes there regularly will rotate seats with you in order to allow you to eat).

I love the Beta cocktail... it's a beautifully crafted beverage with ginger infused vodka.  You really ought to try it.

My \"go-to\" happy hour indulgances include the Lola burger... pickled onions, fried egg, on a english muffin that sops up the yolk?  Yup.  It's good.  REALLY good.  I used to order all my burgers well done... until one of the awesome bartenders gave me a little sass about it - and he was right... medium is the way to go.  My other go-to is their macaroni & cheese.  If you love cheve, goat cheese, and chicken... this is some seriously good eats.  I actually dream about this... and force my friends into this happy hour just so I can get my fix.  

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I am going to have to say that this was honestly one of the best meals of my life!  Stopped through here with my bro on the way to New York for the 4th of July.  We had discovered that not only was Cleveland home to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, but also Micheal Symon's incredible couple of restaurants as well.  
  Decided on this place over Lola simply because we spent quite a bit of time bar hoping near Lola waiting to go in, and thought it would be a good idea to save a little cash and go here instead.
   I have to say I wasn't at all disappointed by what I was experiencing while we were there.  Every single thing we ordered was phenomenal.  From the bone marrow, to the pork belly.  The dates, the wine, and the cheese plate at the end.  It all was the best bite of food I could remember ever having.  
   I hope some day to have the opportunity to go back and experience it all again, but until then i'll reminisce about this most amazing dinner.  I truly believe after this meal, my palate was upgraded to a new level I didn't know was possible.  Not quite sure my wallet thinks thats a good thing, but what does it know."}
{"text":"I found this restaurant when I did a Yelp search after arriving in Cleveland for a quick day trip, and I was REALLY happy that I did.  It was a Sunday afternoon around 4:30pm, and they were very busy.  That's always a good sign.  The happy hour drink menu featured a number of interesting things, and the dinner menu was great. I had a hard time selecting one thing.  The service was knowledgeable and friendly.  The whole experience was excellent."}
{"text":"Best happy hour in Cleveland! Good luck getting a seat after 5, though. There aren't many spots to get the deals that they dish out between 5 and 7. Delicious happy hour food include the brussel sprouts (amazing) and burger (double amazing). They also have several other items, but those other two are the best.

The rest of the menu is, of course, superb as well. However, I usually can't afford to eat here often. The restaurant has a nice decor and is especially inviting in the winter time.

Please note: this should not be confused with Lola (Lolita's younger sell-out brother). This is much better!!!"}
{"text":"So I went here on mother's day and thought I was here for happy hour but they do not honor happy hour prices for special events/holidays. Still though, my Beta cocktail was worth every penny! It was suggested by the bartender and I absolutely loved it. It reminded me of a moscow mule because of the ginger beer. It was very small...and it was so good I sucked it down, but it is still worth it. I have to try their pizzas and drinks for happy hour again. Very cute seating inside and decor. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Lolita still remains my favorite restaurant in Cleveland.  My last review wasn't very useful, so let me provide a bit more detail so you know what you're getting into.

First, make reservations in advance.  The chances of getting a table without reservations are pretty low.  The bar is quite small, so it doesn't serve you well to hope for a spot there if you can't manage to get a table.  While this might seem inconvenient, it really attests to the quality of food and service you'll receive here...it's booked up for good reason.

I have never experienced an unfriendly staff member.  From the hostess to the server to the busboy, everyone seems pretty happy to work there.  Always a bonus.  Happy employees are usually a pretty good sign.

As to the menu, I'll reiterate what I said before.  You should really try everything.  There's not a single thing on this menu that is mediocre.

For meat lovers, the Cured Meats Big Board should be your appetizer of choice.  The thing is huge, so you'll definitely need to split it with at least one another person.  If you think Salami from Subway is good, you don't know what you're missing.  The Big Board is reminiscent of the cured meat selections you'd find in markets in Italy.  Fresh, delicate, and delicious.

For pizza lovers, the Duck Proscuitto is an absolute must try.  Chances are you have never had anything like it before.  Egg on a pizza may sound strange, but it works really well.  In fact, many of Symon's concoctions sound strange, but work really well.  Trust the guy, he knows what he's doing.  If egg-topped pizza isn't your thing, the Mushroom pizza is another solid option.  I can't wait to go back and try the others.

For entrees, the macaroni and cheese is quite good.  However, if you're expecting traditional comfort-food mac & cheese, this is not what you'll get.  Lolita's version is classy and delicious with bold, palate-pleasing flavors.  I've also had the seafood of the day on two occasions, and both were absolutely decadent.

For desserts, the Chocolate Pot du Creme is a wonderful combination of sweet and salty, but I recommend trying the sorbet or gelato of the day if the flavor suits your fancy.  They actually have a Guinness-flavored gelato in rotation.

The food at Lolita is well-made and creative.  What I love about Symon's restaurants is that the chefs know how to design plates that keep your palate excited.  They take simple ingredients and combine them in ways that the average person has never thought of.  Don't be afraid to try something that sounds out of the box, because chances are it will be the best thing you have ever had."}
{"text":"love this place so much that I've been back twice in one week. The food is top notch wonderful. Good wine list, fun cocktail menu and an overall dynamic, unique and creative menu with incredible food options. Flavors linger throughout dishes and spices don't overwhelm. It's a great place for a date or for a fun happy-hour."}
{"text":"Blair and I have a mixed feelings for this place. We decided on a 3.5, and are rounding up for good measure.

Service: the bartender, who we had to hang out with for 30 minutes while our table was getting ready, was a complete jerk.  but our waiter and hostess were delightful. food delivery was s.l.o.w.- but it gave us more time to enjoy cocktails.

Menu: certainly not vegetarian friendly, although they were kind enough to leave the prosciutto out which doubled our options from 2 to 4 dishes.

Interior: sexy, comfortable, unpretentious. 

Crowd: see 'interior'.

Food: outstanding. Favorite was the butternut squash ravioli-- delicate pasta shell bursting with fresh vegetable flavor. 

We were excited about the 9:30 PM happy hour with $5 cocktails; but soon lost our buzz when we received halved cocktails in tiny little glasses.  Lolita: it's all in the detail, don't let things fall apart."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I came here over the summer for dinner and we were all so blown away by the quality of the food. 

I was a little skeptical at first because the hype for Lola (Michael Symon's other restaurant) did not really meet my expectations. However, Lolita was definitely a great place to go. We ordered a bunch of things (pizza, the pig ears, and the bone marrow) to share. I wish I didn't have to share because I could have easily eaten everything on those plates and wished for more. The flavors are really intense and the unexpected ingredients really took my taste buds out for a ride! 

The atmosphere was really nice. We had all gotten dressed up for the night, but the restaurant itself can be casual or dressy. We saw people in dresses like us and people in jeans. It just is a really comfortable place to eat. The food is the centerpiece and everyone was just there to enjoy it. 

I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Lolita's, YEAH!  Great food, the fact that I'm distantly related to the executive chef Matthew, may have a LOT to do with it!  That man can COOK!  I went \"home\" to Cleveland and ate there, oh my GOSH!  YUMMY all around!  Three people in our party, and EVERYONE loved everything!  The chicken, was great with the polenta, and the lemon sorbet with basil cream was like the 4th of July in my mouth!  Too bad I live in CA, although, the restaurant at which I work is really good, too!  
Sideboard, in Danville, CA!"}
{"text":"Lolita has a great Happy Hour with a $5 burger my boyfriend has rated the best in Cleveland, plus some great drink specials, too. Try for a seat at the bar- some fun people-watching to be had there. Of course, you cannot leave without trying their brussel sprouts- best I have ever had. Ever!"}
{"text":"Awesome!  Lived up to the hype.  

Started at the bar as we were walk up customers.  Wife had a nice martini while I had the phenomenal Dogfish Red & White beer.  After around 20 minutes, they had a table for us (it was jamming due to Taste of Tremont festival).  

We started with two apps, the Roasted Garlic Bruschetta with fresh mozzarella and the Roasted Bone Marrow.  Both were great and the bone marrow was incredible.

For dinner, my wife had Spinach & Goat Cheese Ravioli in brown butter & pine nut sauce.  I had the Hanger Steak, which was served with fried Brussel Sprouts.  Both dishes were amazing and cooked perfectly.

Although stuffed, the Chocolate Pot was too tempting not to split.  It was the perfect ending to a perfect dinner.  The chocolate was thick, but not overdone, while the homemade caramel & whipped cream were in perfect balance, and the sea salt sprinkled on top added a wonderful depth of flavor to the whole dish.

Lastly, it was fairly cheap for the quality.  

I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Wife and I split two appetizers and has an entree each. 

Both entrees were a little bland and there's no salt to be found on tables as if everything is already seasoned to perfection. 

Waiter started off nice but got rude near the end. 

Didn't ask if we wanted dessert. We had to ask him for the dessert menu. 

Got in without a problem at 7 on a Friday night and place was nearly empty when we left. Not a good sign, I take it."}
{"text":"Can I give 3.5 stars?  Went to Lolita for dinner last night for my birthday!  The food was outstanding, we all had different entrees and they were all amazing!  I'm getting the risotto the next time regardless of whats in it!  The subtraction of stars comes from the service.... our waiter took away from the experience.  Two of us ordered Hot Dirty Birds and when our drinks came, they were terrible.  It was obvious we weren't happy and asked for olive juice to try to fix them.  They hadn't used Grey Goose and as we were with a large party, we drank them.  They should have been removed and replaced with comment and without us asking for that to happen.  The waiter wasn't pleasant or interactive, he came across as a jerk.  I expect better."}
{"text":"Shortest Yelp review I will ever write: EVERYTHING ON THE MENU IS AMAZING!

(We ordered almost every single item on the menu and all were delicious. Food, cocktails, everything was fantastic.)

Iron Chef Michael Symon= Genius"}
{"text":"I'll admit- i'm a tad biased. I have a slight Michael Symon addiction, so i entered Lolita with extremely high hopes- but thankfully, they were realized. 
Our service was freakishly fast. We were given our apps 10 minutes after ordering, and our dinner was out only 10 minutes after we finished our apps.
Bruschetta- this was amazing. The vinaigrette they drizzle on was HEAVEN. Highly recommend.
Eggplant Caponata- I liked it. Didn't love it.  But someone who is already a baba ganoush fan will really appreciate it. 
Buccatini- so good. A bit too rich for me after awhile, but I still loved the flavors.
Hanger Steak- once again, the vinaigrette blew me away. Perfection. Served with a makeshift salad on top, which I loved. The meat was perfectly cooked.
Overall, this really was an amazing experience- and it was only $40 for two! (but neither of us drank with dinner so I'm sure a wine fanatic would have a much heftier bill)"}
{"text":"Came here for a work trip (yay expense account) and opted for Lolita instead of Lola so I could try more things.  I will say upfront that I had very high expectations since he is an Iron Chef and I was slightly disappointed.  Here's the rundown:  

Awesome Happy Hour...if you sit at the bar, they have quite a decent menu with lots of $5 items.  I wish I would've been there with someone else because I would've ordered one of everything!   But I digress...

I tried: mussels and homemade chorizo...excellent.  
Arugula, goat cheese and pickled onion salad...decent, but really salty
Pappardelle with rabbit, pancetta, mushrooms and ricotta salata...sounds like a ridiculously tasty combination, doesn't it?  Well, again it was too salty and the rabbit was totally overdone.  It wasn't tender and sort of dry.  

If I was ever back in town, I'd definitely go back...everyone has an off nite.  But maybe I'd try Lola first."}
{"text":"Finally came here for dinner and not just happy hour! I do enjoy the ambiance here more than Lola. It blends in well with the Tremont neighborhood, and I felt very comfortable and relaxed here. I still love the ceiling tile here -- it's just beautiful. 

I ordered the pappardelle and it was very delicious! I love the local pasta and veggies. I also shared a side of brussel sprouts and they were seasoned perfectly. My friend ordered one of the meat entrees and really enjoyed herself.

I think it's a great spot to take out of town guests to show them our iron chef's flagship location."}
{"text":"I was surprised by the neighborhood-y feel that Lolita has. You'd think that a restaurant that has a signpost out front ostentatiously declaring that it's Michael Symon's corner would be more flashy. But no, the atmosphere is casually classy, charmingly chic, and cutely quirky (check out the lighting when you're there). Like any good neighborhood bar, there are also a few folks who seem to be regulars.

There are only 10 seats at the bar, so get there before 5 otherwise you'll miss out. Since the appetizers at the bar are only $5, my boyfriend and I got several:
- Burger with pickled red onions, topped with a fried egg, English muffin bun. It was moist, red onions added a nice zing, and they very nicely split it in half for us.
- BRUSSEL SPROUTS. Super flavorful, walnuts gave it a great crunch, and the sprouts themselves were nicely crisped. My only regret is not placing 8 orders.
- Mac and cheese - chicken is slightly on the dry side, and while the gorgonzola sauce was good, it couldn't quiiiite distract us from the dryness of the chicken. Boo. I was expecting a better pasta dish from an Iron Chef who serves pasta with every challenge.
- The orange panna cotta came in a very close second for my favorite dish (the first was the sprouts, in case you couldn't tell by the caps). The cream itself wasn't as heavy as most panna cottas I've had, and the citrus and mint garnish served to lighten it even more. Delish, and perfect because anything heavier and I would have fallen off my bar stool from sheer fullness.

Lolita was literally the ONLY place I wanted to visit in Cleveland. I drove all the way from DC and made it a destination on par with the likes of Zion National Park. I was not disappointed."}
{"text":"4.5 Stars.

It's taken me 3 years to finally make it out to Lolita - despite many telling me that it was, in their opinion better than Lola.  

The menu is more limited, more homey in texture and feel.  The wine list is smaller, and the price point lower than Lola's.  The copper beaded countertop that surfaces the bar is a neat effect, and the overall mood is that of a gastropub or a bistro rather than a formal, stuffy restaurant.

Given that the meal was not mine to pay, I didn't get to sense, first hand, the cost of the meal ...

That said, the pork belly was fearsome good.  Very rich, and very tasty - what more can I say?

I had pork chop for my main, and we also had Tuna Crudo and chicken liver.

Great meal, with good company - yep, sometimes, maybe often, I enjoy hanging with colleagues at gastro-centres."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, excellent service, an all around great place to go! Atmosphere is good for a date night. Very clean with friendly staff. Order came quickly and was correct. Will recommend to friends."}
{"text":"Sometimes (most of the time) it's good to keep reviews simple and to the point.  Enough of this bathing in the aura of self-importance that Yelp provides by allowing us to posture as professional food critics blessing the earth with our enlightened opinions!

Lolita. Ahhh.....! No need to bombard anyone with \"this was delicious,\" \"that was excellent,\" \"the best ____ I ever had,\" \"OMG I think I just died and went to heaven,\" etc etc.  Go there and eat.  Sit at the bar so that you aren't tempted to nitpick the points of service, and can focus solely on the food.  DIve in to the happy hour menu; you don't have to go much further that to realize what you've gotten yourself in to."}
{"text":"Can't believe I haven't reviewed Lolita yet even though it's like one of my favorite restaurants of all times! I've been there for both their happy hour and for dinner. It has not disappointed me on any occasion.

The only problem with happy hour is that it's a relatively small bar so you kind have to try out your luck for seats. But if you do get there, try their brussel sprouts and macroni and cheese.

For dinner, I've tried their duck if I remember correctly. They have some very interesting pairing with their dishes, but it's pretty great. Also, they had a bone marrow appetizer, which is pretty awesome. However we've tried the same one at Lola. They're similiar, this one is just smaller and slightly cheaper.

If you want to go there, please don't think too much about the cost. Because if you do, it'll ruin your experience from head to toe. After all it is a Michael Symon restaurant, right?"}
{"text":"The Lolita Burger is the best I've ever had. The meat is perfectly seasoned and it's served on an English muffin with crispy bacon, a fried egg, and onions. I was in heaven as I devoured it. Really, I was.

Ready for the kicker? The burger is only $5 during Lolita's happy hour.

Their happy hour runs Tuesday thru Thursday 5:00 to 6:30 and 9:30 to close. Friday and Saturday from 5:00 to 6:30 and 10:00 to close. And, Sunday from 4:00 to 6:30.

Also offered during happy hour are Roasted Chicken Wings, Mac & Cheese (which I also tried and ogled over), and Mussels. A bottle of Sierra Nevada will set you back just $2 and a glass of wine just $4.

You must try their burger. Damn, it was good."}
{"text":"As this is a Michael Symon restaurant I was prepared to be blown away. The food was good, but I was expecting it to be great. 

I liked the atmosphere of the place. It was quite busy for a Saturday. Good thing we had reservations. The lighting gave the place a romantic feel. 

The highlight of the meal was the mussels with chirizo, sofrito, in a creamy white wine sauce. I'd come back for this dish alone. 

I ordered the Lolita Bellini, which was ok but not one of my favourite drinks.

For mains we had the duck breast. The duck was cooked perfectly, but it was served colder than I liked. I also enjoyed the purée served underneath.

We also ordered the octypus rissotto. The rissotto was creamy and the octopus was cooked nicely."}
{"text":"Lolita has awesome food and service.   I would definitely come back here if I am in Cleveland again.  Michael Symon lives up to the hype.  I actually preferred Lolita over Lola even without the factor that Lolita is ~50% cheaper.  You should be able to get out of Lolita for under $50/head.

Awesome dishes:
-Roasted bone marrow
-Stuffed peppers
-Chicken - moist, crispy skin, and in a nice light sauce.   this half chicken dish was the best chicken dish I have had in a restaurant.
-Fried brussel sprouts - awesome sauce, sweet and sour with asian notes even though ingrediants are not asian.  
-Sticky toffee pudding cake

Good dishes:
Pork chop - juicy and expertly cooked, but not as special as the chicken.

Mediocre dishes:
Beet and ricotta salad -  I think my beet salad is better.   Pass on this if you can get a better beet salad elsewhere."}
{"text":"Ate here last year on New Year's Eve. It was wonderful! Enough said."}
{"text":"Fantastic experience. Two friends and I embarked on the necessary \"escape from Oberlin for dinner\" trip and weren't disappointed. I've been to Lola before, but this was just as good! We split the grilled shisito peppers, which were delicious with feta and Meyer lemon, and the chicken, duck, and steak. The steak was everyone's favorite--awesome sauce, cheese, onions, everything. It was fairly similar to the steak I had at Lola last February, but that's perfectly fine--I loved them both. The parsley on the duck was a bit off-putting, but it also contained the most delicious celery root puree any of us has tasted. And the chicken was delicious as well--nothing too adventurous, but well-roasted and the salsa verde/radish composition gave it a very fresh, summery flavor. The service was a bit slow--a lot of time between courses. Nonetheless, we'll be back.

Edited because I forgot to mention the brussels sprouts. Yeah, they're as good as everyone says. Great polenta, too."}
{"text":"I love love love Lolita!

The food is amazing.  I don't think I had lived until I had the rosemary and goat cheese macaroni.  The first time I went with a group and we all took bites of each other's meals.  Everything was delicious!

The atmosphere is great as well.  It's intimate and interesting without trying too hard.  

A really great restaurant.  I always feel lucky when I get to go here."}
{"text":"Thank you Michael Symon for making my inner fat kid extremely satisfied! I've been to Lolita a few times now, and I am finally ready to write a well-deserved review for one of my favorite restaurants :) 

First things first, make sure you make a reservation before coming here! Even on a weekday night it can get pretty busy because everyone and their moms know how amazing this place is.

For starters, I recommend getting the pig ears/tails, bone marrow, and mussels. The pig tails and ears are super crispy! The pig tails are slightly fatty, but it's not overpowering and is balanced well by the crispy skin and tangy flavor! The bone marrow is very savory and slightly fatty as well, but again, not too much! Mussels are always my go-to appetizers, and Lolita is no exception! I love the lightness of the sauce, and the crunchy breads are perfect for your dipping pleasures :) 

For the entree, I've tried the following: 
- Pork sausage pizza: crispy crust with deliciously tender pork? Can't ask for anything more! 
- Grilled Quail: you get 2 quails in this dish! The meat is suuuuuuper, like ridiculously, tender! The flavoring is great as well, a bit sweet and very savory! 
- Pork chop milanese: Perfectly crispy outer shell with tender and flavorful pork! The sauce has a hint of sweetness in it. I love it! 

I always order the brussel sprouts as a side! It is perfectly salted and savory. Some may think it's kinda oily, but my taste buds like it just fine :) I've recently tried their new cauliflower side, which is my NEW favorite! It's similar to mac n cheese but without the mac and with tons of cauliflower! Best part about it is the crunchy top layer, which goes so well with the soft and creamy core! 

I'm looking forward to many more trips to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"The happy hour here is excellent. It's only served at the bar, but we were lucky enough to get one of the tables near the bar. I can't speak for the cocktails, but the beer and wine are bargains. The happy hour food menu offers a few selections for $5. We ordered the 1/2 mac-and-cheese and Lolita burger from the happy hour menu, and a tomato pizza from the regular menu.

The mac-and-cheese consisted of al dente macaroni, a light cheese sauce with strong rosemary flavor, and juicy chunks of chicken breast. The Lolita burger, which is served without any sides for happy hour, was a towering concoction of ground beef, cheddar cheese, fried onions, bacon, an over-easy egg, and an English muffin-like bun. I normally like my burgers fairly simple, but the flavors in this sandwich were very well put together, and the runny egg yolk because a de facto sauce once it broke.

At this point, we realized the pizza would be too much, but went for it anyway. (My suggestion to others coming for happy hour is to order 3 items from the menu per 2 people.) The crust was flavorful, the sauce tasted fresh (the fresh tomatoes really made an impact, blending with the sauce), and there was the perfect amount of cheese. My only complaint is that the pizza wasn't rotated properly, so one side was slightly burnt.

As others have stated, service was a bit slow, and our server disappeared for a while. It wasn't horrible, but was a bit irritating when our glasses were empty."}
{"text":"The best pork chop I've ever had.  The best brussels sprouts that have ever graced my palate.  They were adorned with capers, anchovies and walnut.  I would go here every day if I could and just eat the brussels sprouts.  

Crispy pig tails and ears appetizer = Ahh-MA-zing.
Venison Carpaccio - pomegranate, orange, juniper, parsnip, agrumato = Out of this world. 

I really don't know what else to say, except that this is one of the best dining experiences I've had in ages.  Fortunately my friend Emmalyn and I had been eating all day, so we were full enough to take home left-overs.  The next morning I made the world's tastiest omelet from the left-over pork chop and brussels sprouts.  It was just as good as it had been the night before, if not better.  

The venue is a bit crowded, but I don't care.  The lighting is perfect.  Romantic ambiance.  I had been to Lola about a year and a half ago with this guy I used to date (but with whom I am still close friends), so I called him to tell him how Lolita measured up.  We had loved Lola, and Lolita was a great runner-up.  

Lolita, ooh la la!"}
{"text":"Go for the happy hour. It starts at 5 but there are only about 10 seats at the bar where you can get the specials so get there about 430 and be waiting. So worth it. Get the brussel sprouts. And bone marrow."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. I wanted to love Lola but it was really a disappointment. The restaurant is dimly lit with loud acoustics but appealing and the menu had lots to offer. Unfortunately the food wasn't that great. My pasta was over cooked and not freshly made, the roasted chicken was tender but not that flavorful (and at 65.00 for chicken, it really should be amazing). The food including the sides was overall pretty heavy. The service was super slow and unorganized which was perhaps the worst part of this expensive meal."}
{"text":"On my last night in Cleveland, I wanted to try out one of the Michael Symon restaurants, so my cousin made reservations here.

Everything in our meal was delicious. The first thing we did was order a bottle of red wine. We chose a bottle from Spain which was fantastic. For appetizers, we got the roasted bone marrow and charred eggplant dip. I loved the bone marrow. So unhealthy, but I didn't care. I really liked the eggplant dip especially the homemade flatbread. For my main course, I got the duck confit with a butternut squash puree and mustardo vinaigrette. The duck was so tender and I literally wanted to scrap every last bite off my plate. My entree came with creamy polenta also. Delicious! My cousins got the buccatini and mushroom pizza. They both said their meals were good also. Then for dessert, we all shared the warm chocolate cake and gelato. The cake was to die for and the hazelnut ice cream on top of it really added to the flavor. I forgot what the flavor was for the gelato, but it was refreshing.

For the amount we paid, I thought the meal was very good value ($40 bucks/per person). I highly recommend! I want to try Lola's next!"}
{"text":"A little too trendy for its own good. We ordered 2 specialty drinks that sounded interesting, but the flavors didn't mesh well. The food was decent but not so amazing that we would want to go back. A little disappointed."}
{"text":"It's all about the food. No fancy neighborhood; its in an old building but they created a welcoming and very cozy space with lots of love. The food is outstanding and speaks for itself. Service could be improved and be more attentive, especially if you have a big group."}
{"text":"This is not LOLA... its loud and more of a casual bar scene.  However, what they have is great.  I tried the fried Brussels (good, but not my personal preparation preference), the polenta, the bone marrow and the pork sausage pizza.  The polenta and marrow were very good.  The polenta was the best I've ever had, but I must admit that it's not something I eat often.  The pork sausage pizza was also good. Nothing blew me away. It was a great bar scene, but slightly odd for me.  The service was just ok and they were out of muscles so I couldn't score those.  Nice night... glad I checked it out."}
{"text":"Great drinks, very nice ambient, great service.... I ventured out and for the first time tried bone marrow and pig ears and tail! The bone marrow was great, and pig ears and tail wasn't bad but didn't really blow me away.... I tried the Mac and goat cheese which was good, and the polenta was also good. 

If if have to pick between Lola's and Lolita's \"food wise\" I think I would pick Lola's.... But Lolita's was still a great spot to visit and I would definitely come back again...!"}
{"text":"Waited over an hour and fifteen minutes for a seventeen dollar pizza! People that came in after us were served before us! After paying for our over priced meal no one asked if everything was ok! No birthday dessert or even a scoop of vanilla ice cream was available, I asked to speak to the manager and he just made excuses that they had a small kitchen and problems with there tickets in the back! I told him I owned my own business and had over three thousand patients that ask both me and my staff about places to go, the manager said nothing!"}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant just outside of downtown in Cleveland.  Everything was delicious, service was great, and the look and feel of the room made us feel like we were in Tribeca -- in a good way!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. A must go to place if in Cleveland. Had the Charred eggplant dip and the Hanger Steak."}
{"text":"After every #SneakerCon event we have a ritual staff dinner. At most cities we know what to expect when it comes to cuisine but that wasn't the case with Cleveland. 

When we arrived at Lolita I immediately appreciated the design of their establishment, a quiet dim feel which was perfect after the intensity and high energy of our event.

The appetizers were unexpected. Never had roasted bone marrow and it was delicious. Crispy Pig Tail and Ears??? Mind blowing mix of texture and flavor. The pickles chilies were the highlight. It was such a delight to taste the cured prosciuttos, which included the pride of Spain (Jamon Serrano).

For my entree? The Bone In Pork Chop. So tender and I'm usually not a fan of mustard seeds but they went perfect with this dish. The side of cippolini onions were a great compliment to the Local Potatoes which were seasoned simply to perfect.

Highly recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Lovely restaurant with a beautiful asethetic and multi tiered restaurant floor. We very much enjoyed the starters. Bone Marrow was an interesting experience and very nicely presented for A, Grilled sweet corn was simple but so delicious for me. We also shared a squash blossom pizza that had a great crust. We were disapointed that they have discontinued the burger. Also, though the kitchen is great and open, it was quite smoky in the restaurant. Overall enjoyable and great to walk around Tremont afterwards!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. the bar didn't even carry brandy of any kind and food was totally unmemorable.  I expected much more from an Iron Chef.  I have better food in a tavern in San Francisco..Will never go back."}
{"text":"During a recent business trip to Cleveland, I ventured over Tremont to sample the local fare with an old friend. It was a perfect evening made just a little better by our stellar dinner. The gracious reviews here are all spot-on. It is a terrific restaurant. If timing allows, go on Tuesday night. The restaurant does an off menu pig roast. The featured dish was shredded pork on top of polenta. Yep, as fabulous as it sounds. Don't miss the bone marrow, eggplant dip and the much lauded Brussels sprouts (they will make you a fan, despite any horrific childhood memories of the veg). Love this place and will be back."}
{"text":"What a nice dining experience!

I went to Lolitas with my girlfriend and some work friends last night.  This was the second time I have gone but my first review.

We got an assortment of appetizers at the table and shared.  All of them were fantastic!  Hot Stuffed Peppers- Yay.  Flatbread with a Ricotta type dip- Yay.  Bruscetta- Yay.

I got the Walleye Special.  The fish was perfectly and delicately cooked without the over the top buttery flavor typical to fish in restaurants.  The asparagus was crisp and tasted fantastic except it was a very small portion.  I got the Fried Brussell Sprouts and they were totally amazing.

Desert consisted of the Chocolate Pot Du Creme and a coffee.  Ah-Mazing.  Rich chocolately mousse with Sea Salt mixed in!  What could possibly be wrong about that?  I really was blown away by the taste.

One word of caution.  The Martini's are rediculously overpriced and I will not order them again.  11 Dollars a piece is honestly robbing the customers."}
{"text":"A supper yummy and intimate bistro in the heart of Cleveland's Tremont neighborhood.  Amazing happy hour and a great staff!  i miss having this place just blocks away.  indulge in the roasted dates... they are to die for!"}
{"text":"I was passing through Cleveland, visiting a friend, and we ended up getting late night dinner/snack here after an Indians game.
I found out afterwards that Lolita is owned by Michael Symon, who's apparently a famous celebrity chef.
The late night menu here is amazing. I had the hamburger, which includes egg, bacon, and cheddar. Very, very good. Also had the fried brussels sprouts (flavored with anchovies), which was surprisingly good. Each was $5 on the late night menu. For drinks, had the \"beta\", which is vodka + ginger, soda, lime ($5). A Sierra Nevada (bottle) was $2.

All in all, a very good experience. Great value for great food, and a nice ambiance that made for easy conversation."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of friends and the place was literally packed. They have two happy hour times. 5-6:30 and 10:30-close. We were there for the first time slot. It was a beautiful Friday afternoon and if they had a patio, it would be even more awesome but I gotta say, hands down the food here is amazing. I ordered their mussels and eggplant dip. Both tasted up to par. The mussels were cooked perfectly and for $5 it's definitely worth it. The pita bread was lightly seasoned and toasted. The dip i believe is sort of a hummus spread so tasted light and kind of a tart. For drinks, I got their white wine which was around $4. If you're planning on sitting at a table, the two tables by the window are the only tables allowed plus the bar area. 

Other than that this is one of Michael Symon restaurants around Cleveland. The decor is contemporary inside and the space is pretty tight to be honest. Overall I liked the food and service was great."}
{"text":"Just great! Such a nice little spot. I had the duck confit which was absolutely delicious. Great place for a date!"}
{"text":"Had a good time at Lolita! I had the Spaghetti carbonara that was on point!  I huge portion that I couldn't finish.  Well I did start with the brushetta with fava bean and arugala.  

This place in a great neighborhood and the atmosphere was lively.  I have a place to visit, over and over again when I am in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"I've come a long way from asking Michael Symon to take a picture of Guy Fieri and myself at a Cavs game years ago. Don't worry. I got looks of confusion and was asked why I didn't want him in the photo also... I have grown up and am much more in touch with my foodie side and will never make this mistake again.

Lolita. I love you. Never do you disappoint. Stand me up. Or give me the cold shoulder. Warm. Inviting. Dreamy. Delectable. I could go on...

I will. 

The Roasted Dates...Oh My!!! 
Fried Brussel Sprouts...Have you read any of the other reviews??? Amazeballz!!!!!
Cauliflower Gratin. I don't care if it's even semi healthy since cauliflower is in the name. Try it. Thank me later.
Crispy Local Potatoes+chili flake+orange zest...really...
Soft Polenta+mascarpone and parmesan=melt in your mouth yum!
Pork Chop was perfection.
Mac & Cheese is also a fan fav. def in the winter.
HH Lolita Burger. I feel like this is his signature burger. As it should be.

I'll be back. (Arnold style) For drinks. For late night snacks. And for everything in between. xoxo"}
{"text":"a lot of innovation, but below expectation. don't like the deep fried pig ear, duck confit is not bad but no highlights. brussel sprout is awesome, but again, too much oil!"}
{"text":"Deep fried Brussels sprouts with walnuts and capers. Love and happiness in a bowl. As soon as I got home, I looked up the recipe and practiced making them myself.

Otherwise- Great pizza. Great service. Great happy hour specials."}
{"text":"I love Lolita!  The atmosphere is great, the food is great, what more can you ask for?  

My first experience at Lolita was with a group of about 8 women.  We all thoroughly enjoyed out dinner and had a great night out.  I had the Baked Penne with beef bolognese and it was awesome.  

The second time I visited Lolita was when I went with my sister who was visiting from our of state.  We shared the \"Big Board\" selection of meats as an appetizer and I had the Gnocchi as an entree.   Both were very good!!!  The name \"Big Board\" is pretty accurate.... there was enough for probably 4 people to share, so we were unable to finish it between just the two of us.  

I will definitely return to Lolita in the future.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!

The ambience is fantastic.  Can get pretty loud when the restaurant is packed and the bar is standing room only.  However, the energy spills over to the wait staff, which will also infect you as well, which is great.

The food here is superb.  It is Lola type flavors and quality at a much better price.  The flavors are amazing.  The portions are large.  The brussel sprouts are delicious.  Loved the bone marrow, which melts in your mouth.  The pizzas are wonderful.  Haven't had better hanger steak since leaving the Napa Valley.  

Hands down, this restaurant is fantastic, and the food is great.  The only downfall is the wait (hence the 4 stars rather than 5).  I've eaten here twice, and each time we had to wait an hour beyond our reservations.  Kind of a bummer, but hey, good things come to those who wait, and this place is definitely worth it.  

If you get tired of the wait, you could head across the street and eat at Lago, which is also fantastic."}
{"text":"Oh Lolito Polita Momoita. Why haven't i ever reviewed you yet? I have had plenty of good times around the cozy dark bar, stunning dinner experiences with friends, and a few drunken nights at the bar again. What more can I say? There is nothing bad to say about the food. The menu boasts some of the tastiest appetizers and small plates as well as a bad ass burger served on an english muffin with fried egg. I had a sea bass special on my last visit and the skin was really crispy but the flesh was flakey and delicate. It was to die for. Yum. Here are some tips and pointers


*try to go during off peak hours if drinking at the bar. It's tiny and eats fill fast

*make reservations for dinner. Even when dining on weekdays it is best to give them a call and get your name on the list. They are pretty good about squeezing in walk ins that give them a call before they arrive

*Lolita has one of the best happy hours. Try it!

*the dining room is really fun too! i normally don't sit in the dining room when eating out but Lolita has a super cool and energetic vibe

*don't be a douche.... trying to tell them that it's too dark and you can't see is something they hear all the time. If Lolita wanted to turn the lights up they would have done it 6 years ago.

Cheers"}
{"text":"Recently hit up Michael Symon's Lolita for happy hour.  Definitely a fan!  Wallet friendly prices for good drinks and munchies.
We sampled every app on the happy hour menu along with the red wine, featured lager and a mixed drink called the Beta.  The wine cooler dispenser made me try to figure where I could work one into my home!  lol
The mussels with chorizo were delicious.  Plenty of broth to be sucked up with bread that our fantastic bartender gave us.  
The fried brussels sprouts are not for the mainstream.  Caper and anchovy butter and pecans.  I loved them but I was the only one in our crowd that did.  Yummmmm.
The flatbread with charred  eggplant dip was good. Not over the top seasoning but still good.
The macaroni and cheese with goat cheese,chicken and rosemary  added was delicious!  (and I'm not a rosemary fan!)
The burger with fried egg and bacon on an english muffin was amazingly heavenly!  I have to admit I was not blown away by the thoughts of it, but damn I am happy I was wrong!!!
Get there at least 5 minutes before 5:00 as the specials only apply to those sitting at the bar!  
ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Michael Simon - you are a badass! :) Haivng lived in Chicago and New York the past 10 years, I thought it would be hard to find some restaurants that could match the personality and amazing flavors I have been spoiled by in each city.

While Lolita is a drive from the downtown area - it is worth it! :) it will expose you to a more hipster part of Cleveland with a great ambiance and amazing food.  I strongly suggest the following if you go to the happy hour after 1030: fried brusselsprouts, truffle mac and cheese, and the fried chicken liver (acquired taste)...basically with drinks and all these happy hour dishes, we were more than full and it cost just shy of $50.  

The staff were amazingly pleasant and so accommodating.  Visiting a bunch of establishments like Lolita have made me a fan of OHIO! :)"}
{"text":"The food was excellent, service was perfect, ambiance is chill and hip. Better than Lola, nuff said."}
{"text":"Visited this place over the 4th of July weekend. This was one of the highlights of our vacation. The menu is limited but the selections are different to say the least. We sampled a few appetizers and entrees and everything was great. Our waitress was able to get us a latte even though it was not on the menu. And it was so good that I another one at the end of the meal. Food was worth taking a picture as well as finger licking tasty. 

The location of the restaurant was something I was not impressed with and you have to park on the street.

Overall a great experience and I look forward to visiting other Iron Chef restaurants."}
{"text":"Great food from starters to entrees to desert.  A food experience that should not be miss. If you go to or live in Cleveland you MUST go to Lolita (or Lola)."}
{"text":"I want to thank the operations manager of the Michael Symon restaurants for contacting me and discussing my experience at \"Lolita\" . He sent me a wonderful letter and I am glad to say the story has a pleasant resolution. I am also happy that the Michael Symon restaurants continue to live up to their stellar reputation."}
{"text":"I used to be the biggest Lolita advocate-- I was so pleasantly surprised the first few times eating here that I told all my friends and kept going back for more. The bread is great, brussel sprouts are the best I've ever had, they make chicken livers seem like a delicacy and the duck confit was my favorite thing on the menu. Unfortunately however, they have recently taken the duck off the menu :( :( :( This is when things started going down hill...

The last couple times I had eaten there, I had the same rude waitress who basically rolled her eyes when our table asked for more bread. She was anything but accommodating. The food seemed to have went down in quality and instead of duck confit they offered quail. Quail?!?!? My boyfriend got it and let me try- it was gamey and gross. 

I wish I could bring myself to go back and give it another chance, but my last visits turned my rave reviews into a thumbs down. I hope one day this will not be the case!! Bring back the duck confit!!!!"}
{"text":"Decided to come here tonight with my dad after a long and chilly day at the Cleveland Air Show.  Glad we called ahead for reservations because it was down to two choice, 5:45 or wait until 9 to get a seating for dinner!  So, lesson be learned, make reservations early if you want a prime dining time....

Now, unless you want to pay for valet parking, also leave yourself an extra 10-15 min to find parking in Tremont, granted, the Polish festival was also on this evening, but the parking situation in this neighborhood is frequently difficult.

Arrived a few minutes ahead of our reservation and were seated immediately, the hostess walked us to our table and there was a huge chunk of broken wine glass (about 1/3 of the glass, pretty hard to miss) sitting right under the bench I was to sit on.  I pointed it out to the hostess and she apologized while clearing it out of the way, no big deal, but a little strange for such a nice place.

Waited....and waited....uh, ok, anytime now.  Seriously, our waiter was taking care of 3 tables (including ours) and it took him almost 10 min to come by and see what we wanted to drink.  And then when we ordered tea, he didn't even ask us if we wanted milk and sugar, took almost another 10 min to get those out to the table.  Fail number two...

The menu looked intriguing, and even though I didn't have the best meal of my life here, it was good enough that I will come back again to try other dishes.  I started with the roasted beet salad....not bad, lacking in flavor a little, but that may be because I am used to eating pickled beets instead....however, a little seasoning couldn't hurt on these.

I got the pork chop and my dad went with the mac and cheese.  The portions were huge, neither of us could finish our meals.  The mac and cheese was nice, but super rich, so rich that the Clinic's Heart institute should sponsor this place, 10% off your first bypass surgery once you've eaten 10 mac and cheeses from Lolita's!  The pork chop itself was really nice, and I loved the greens that they had on top of it, very flavorful.  The polenta that the chop was sitting on was once again too cheesy....I could barely taste any corn.  I'm a cheese lover, but damn, Mr. Symon, I like to taste the thing I ordered as well.

Waiter talked me into the Brussels Sprouts, meh....could take 'em or leave 'em, nothing amazing.

Now, I also like to give places like this chances to astound me for dessert as well.  Ordered the chocolate pot de creme because I had seen it in so many reviews....well, Mr. Symon needs to overhaul his thinking about what great chocolate tastes like.  The combination mixture on the top with creme, caramel and sea salt tasted ok, but once all of that was gone, you were left with a very rich, but bitter tasting chocolate, nothing spectacular as a stand alone.

The party at the table next to us got the bone marrow appetizer, have had this back home on a few reservations and was a little disappointed to find out that they didn't use wild game.....yeah, it's just regular beef marrow.  C'mon, I'm sure you could get in moose, buffalo, elk, something other than just cattle....but I will try it next time.

For this price, you only get one more chance to impress Mr. Symon...."}
{"text":"We went to Lolita Sunday early evening after a trip to the new casino in Cleveland, we wanted to try Lola but it wasn't open.  The space is very well done, great light bulb treatment and patio, we were seated in a very comfortable table directly across from the kitchen - when I say directly, it was almost like being IN the kitchen, we heard and saw all - some training on professional kitchen etiquette is required.  The absolute best thing about our visit was the service, our waitress was right up there at the top of my list (short blondish hair and lots on tats).  Our table of 4 started with a cocktail (well made), a beer and a bottle of wine, really liked the fact that the waitress came back to explain the bottle of wine to be sure that is what we wanted, it wasn't, so that was really appreciated.  We started with the dates and meatballs - the dates were amazing, the sauce that came with them was excellent, the meatballs were a bit mushy and the sauce seemed super acidic.  I have reviewed meatballs before, I think mine are better than most places.  The table split two pizzas, they were just fine, nothing chef worthy, just fine - I can't judge on pizzas alone so am going back for another visit.  We also had the brussel sprouts and a very excellent soft polenta.  The wait between apps and pizzas was right about an hour - not acceptable when the kitchen crew is loud and heard in the dining room, there was too much joking with a bearded male employee who I can only assume was training because he never left the kitchen bar area and we got to hear all the conversation being had - it wasn't professional, I expected more. And yes, like another reviewer, two of us did notice the guy in the middle (calling orders) tasting off spoons and not washing them, it was definitively gross from a diners perspective.  I love when a restaurant has an open kitchen and you see the staff working in symphony, seeing a chef at the top of his game, like an iron chef - we saw Taco Bell.  More after our next visit."}
{"text":"I cannot give this place more then one star. Is sucks that the food is good but the service is absolutely horrible. We had reservations at 6:45 and they didn't seat us till 7:30 ! Absolutely ridiculous ! They knew we  were mad and brought us over an appetizer ! We were honking oh at least they made up for it ! Yeah right. She then took 30 minutes before she , the server , came to our table to take our drink order !!!! 
The whole night went this way !!!!!!! 
When you go to a nice restaurant of this caliber you expect good service !!!! 

I wouldn't even go back a third time. Both of my experiences have been this way. I don't care if your busy , you need to hire more staff then !!!!"}
{"text":"I am a Chef Symon fan and was excited to eat at one of his restaurants during my quick stop in Cleveland.  Lola was closed (it was Sunday) so I chose Lolita.

I really enjoyed it and had a delicious meal.

I started with the Roasted Bone Marrow appetizer.  Not something you find every day on a menu.  It was rich and fatty and delicious!!!!  The pickled onion really adds another layer of flavor to cut through some of that richness from the marrow.  I really enjoyed it.

Second course was the Mushroom Pizza with a side of Roasted Brussels Sprouts.  The pizza was thin crust and delicious!  The brussels sprouts, although maybe slighty oily, were delicious and were roasted well with the walnuts.

I could not even finish my meal to enjoy a dessert...just a reason to go back.

The restaurant seems to be in a kind of hip, young area known as Tremont...it was nice to walk around and see a little local flair!"}
{"text":"I came here for happy hour and ordered appetizers and cocktails. Everything was solid, but nothing stood out as very good. I'm giving this place only two stars, though, because the appetizers we ordered took FOREVER and they actually forgot to bring out one of our items. Place wasn't even busy."}
{"text":"Dropped in at 9 PM on a Friday night with hopes of getting a late table for 4. Got on the list for a 45 min wait and grabbed 4 stools at the bar. Will and 'Sin Jin' got us set up with perfect drinks and some small plate orders ... By the time we'd settled down and were sipping away a table came up and the move from the bar was on. We had to close out the bar tab, but our order was seamlessly moved to our table and the spacing of the courses was handled flawlessly by Tiffany. The food was blissful - roasted dates, bucatelli, sopressa pizza, cured meat platter, gnocchi, anchovy pizza ... Everything went well with everyone's choices, so cross-pollination was the order of the night. Dessert of pot de creme and the special sorbet were a perfect shared finish. The service was impeccable, the food was perfect for sharing among friends. Our visitors were blown away their first night in Cleveland. The only downside, a night at Lolita will be hard to top during the rest of their visit."}
{"text":"I used to live in Cleveland and was  back for a visit a couple of weeks ago. I was very impressed with how Tremont has come to life. The neighborhood is a perfect setting for those young professionals looking to have a good time and willing to pay a little more than they would in say, Lakewood. It was a great area to check out. 

Lolita was able to fit in a reservation for 4 on Saturday at fairly short notice. Props to them! We had a great outlook going into this place! Upon arrival we only waited for about 10 minutes. Long enough to check out the bar across the street for a (very) quick beer.  The atmosphere in Lolita was perfect. Candles aligning the wall with a large window overlooking the hip street. 

I ordered a Gin drink - one of the specialty drinks, The Big Bad Wolf. I wasn't impressed with the drink. In fact the $10 drink was probably the low point of our visit. For an expensive drink, I'd expect something more enjoyable. Something about the cherry took me back to what a cherry bomb tastes like. Just too much cherry!. I'll stick with a plain ole Gin and Tonic next time. Their mixture wasn't doing it for me. 

We ordered the Eggplant dip and the roasted dates for an app. I'm not huge into Dates, but they were worth trying. The people in my party who enjoy dates thought they were great. I love Eggplant and hummus (this dip reminded me of hummus) so the dip was a win for me as well! The flatbread that accompanied it was a great touch. 

I ordered a meal and my friend ordered a meal and we split so we could enjoy two! What a perfect plan for food lovers looking to check out the menu. Their mac and cheese has goat cheese in it. It was delicious! You must try it. We also ordered the pork which was delicious but a little small. I'm glad we shared and started with apps or that might not have been enough for this food lover. 

Overall, Lolita is a great date spot and worth your visit! Check it out!"}
{"text":"Lolita is a must-see for anyone visiting Cleveland. Everyone wants to go to Lola because they see Michael Symon on TV. But here's the secret Cleveland's been keeping: Lolita is the original.

Lolita has a number of the same menu options as Lola but the prices are roughly half. Lolita is the original Tremont home. Lola moved from Tremont to 4th Street as part of a downtown revitalization project and Lolita was created in the same space by the same people. Tremont is Cleveland's hip neighborhood and Lolita is a great way to start the evening.

Everything on the menu is amazing with one exception (which I'll detail below). I specifically recommend Warm Olives and Mussels (save your bread for the sauce) to start and any of the pizzas or pastas if you're not starved. If you are hungry, the Hanger Steak or Roasted Chicken are solid choices that are always on the menu. I can't get enough of the Soft Polenta.

One thing I'm not a big fan of is that they tweak the menu roughly once per quarter and may change a core menu item (like the Mussels) but there is no way to know if it is the same as before or new. It's always fun to see what is new but can be disappointing if you really liked the old way and are surprised with a modification that didn't succeed.

The exception on the amazing food (and thus far, applies to all Symon concepts) is that desserts are weak. I would simply avoid and go somewhere else.

Lolita is the standard bearer for 5 star restaurants. If you come to Cleveland and don't eat here, you have done yourself a disservice."}
{"text":"There are so many amazing things I can say about Lolita. The chefs are phenomenal. The wine list delightful. The food is to die for. I was lucky to visit this time being a guest of a friend of the chef. While their food presentation is always stellar we got star treatment. 
We dined on the brussel sprouts, creamy polenta, duck meatballs, big board meat plate, maple glazed pork belly, salad, cheese plate...everything was outstanding. 
I am not a big meat eater but knowing James the Executive Chef takes the time to know his meats and offer only the finest meant turning down nothing. I cannot be more happy I didn't. Having never eaten much pate or meat mousse I was slightly hesitant but open minded. Life changing is the only way I can describe the taste of the chicken mousse.
I could go on and on and on but all I can say is go. They have a late night happy hour too with great prices on drinks and filling food.
GO!"}
{"text":"I was super excited to get a table at Lolita on a Friday evening on the patio.  Unfortunately it was a disappointing experience.  I ordered the Gnocchi and it was excellent but the portion was toddler sized (5 tiny gnocchi and 4 tiny meatballs).   Luckily I ordered a side of the Brussell sprouts or I would have left hungry (I'm not a big eater either).

The service was the major problem.  We were pretty much ignored, had to beg another waitress to give us water.  Our wine glasses were never refilled after the bottle was initially brought out.  My friend ordered pizza and the leftovers were folded and shoved into a tiny little box.

Overall, not impressed and I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Really delicious and well-seasoned food. I had the pappardelle peas and oyster mushrooms that was to die for. Also don't miss the fried brussel sprouts and chocolate pots de creme for dessert!  Service was a lil' slow, but with only 3 peeps in the kitchen, it's not surprising. Great meal overall."}
{"text":"After years of being a Food Network nerd, I definitely wanted to make sure to get to one of Michael Symon's restaurants while we were in Cleveland.  You never quite know what to expect, but in my opinion Lolita lived up to the hype.

The space itself isn't as big as I expected, but I really liked the decor, and the open kitchen layout is great.  It was a bit loud, but not to the point you couldn't carry on a conversation.  There didn't seem to be much of a dress code-- the servers are fairly casual, and we saw other diners there in everything from shorts to suits on a Wednesday evening.  Our server was great-- he had helpful recommendations about both food and drinks, as well as excellent timing; we never felt ignored or rushed.

The menu is \"meat-centric,\" to say the least, so vegetarians and vegans beware.  Several of the appetizers were out of my comfort zone; maybe I'm a wuss, but I couldn't bring myself to order crispy pig ears or bone marrow.  That said, I think most omnivores could find things to be pleased with.  We ordered:
--ceviche appetizer: not a large portion, but delicious.  The citrus and shoyu combined very well and it had just the right amount of jalapeños.
--hanger steak:  my husband had this and I got to try a bite-- it was excellent, and we both loved the blue cheese sauce.  He said his side of potatoes was delicious as well.
--carrot agnolotti: this was a great pasta dish!  the carrots had just the right amount of sweetness.  I'd never had rabbit before but actually really enjoyed the flavor.  My only complaint would be that I found several small bones in the rabbit; having never had rabbit, this may be totally normal, so I'm not knocking them for it.
--drinks: I had a cocktail that I don't see on their online menu, but really enjoyed, and my husband had the \"apiary\" and liked.  They also had a good selection of wines by the glass.
--dessert: we shared a dark chocolate panna cotta and really enjoyed.

I'm impressed, Cleveland."}
{"text":"Michael Symon is a genius. We had the best meal and I love eating in the Tremont area. We had the bone marrow, ears and tails, pork rinds, and crispy chicken livers. The livers came in a creamy mushroom sauce that was amazing! The pork rinds were brought to the table and we're still popping from being freshly fried, they were deliceous.
Main course was cheese pizza, risotto, and the ramp pizza. All 3 dishes were amazing!
We finished the night with a creamy dark chocolate panacotta with a black cherry preserve. Soooo good. I definately recommend Lolita's!"}
{"text":"I had a superb experience at Lolita.  Honestly I didn't even know who Michael Symon was but apparently he's a bit of a celebrity in Cleveland and has a few restaurants.  But after doing some research on him, the bar was set pretty high and fortunately Lolita delivered.

Food:  We had the hummus as an appetizer and a pizza and mac and cheese (with 4 cheeses) for our entrees--all of which were delicious!  We had the key lime pie for dessert which was very good but personally could've used some more lime.

Service:  Outstanding!  Our waitress was super friendly and knowledgeable, and gave us great, personalized recommendations after asking for some of our preferences.  She also recommended a perfect Great Lakes beer to go along with my meal.

Value:  I thought this was going to be expensive since it's a celebrity chef's restaurant but it was very reasonable and totally in line with other (not as good) restaurants in Cleveland.

Atmosphere:  The area (Tremont) is a nice area with a fair number of restaurants and bars and it was only a 10-15 min cab ride away from downtown.  The inside of the restaurant is a bit small but the lighting was just right and there was a good noise level."}
{"text":"The best Happy hour in Cleveland. Reasonable price with good food, incredible taste."}
{"text":"Holy shit, did I just walk into a Restoration Hardware catalog? Exposed brick, dim, retro incandescent lights, little piggie statues, dark wood. I won't bother going into all of the details about how quaint, cozy and warm the place is, because that'd just be parroting the hundreds of others who've already said it. Don't get me wrong, it's all those things and more, I'd just hate to be accused of rehashing the obvious. I dig the vibe here. It kinda makes me feel classier than I am. I actually put on a pair of nice shoes for this.

I can't speak to the regular menu because our mission was happy hour only. We got there just about 5pm, Thursday. Two ladies at the bar enjoying the eggplant dip munchie (basically baba ganoush with pita wedges), plenty of black shirts standing around, the out-front kitchen, exposed like Janet's right nipple, bustling in preparation for the impending crowds. Lights already low. We took a seat at the bar. Copper-topped, no big lip to get in the way. A nice eating bar. Plus you can ogle the kitchen.

Immediately, the bartender greeted us. He was friendly enough, but never cracked a smile. I think he didn't want us to think he was too friendly. Big book of wines, folded cocktail/beers list, menu. The wife went with a Reisling, $9 a glass. Cheap considering most of the wines were priced at $12 a glass or above. She enjoyed it. I opted for a beer (gasp of surprise). Not a bad bottle list. No draught selections. Bummer. The Breckenridge Pandora's Bock was splendid - everything a bock should be, crystal clear, amber-colored, malty, slight hop bite, no hop aroma to speak of.

It was to be all happy hour munchies tonight. Everything was priced at $5. We were going to get outta here cheaply.

Fried Brussel's Sprouts - One of the few vegetables I crave. These were quick fried leading to some nice charred leaves, served in a small crock with a slightly sweet vinegar reduction, walnuts and diced red onion. The menu mentions capers and anchovies but I didn't notice either. A bit harder than I like my sprouts, but the walnuts were a stroke of genius. Earthy, perfectly balanced. The only way to enjoy the sprout of Brussels.

Mac 'n Cheese - Way more than enough for two people to share. Big elbows of mac covered in melty, ooey deliciousness. Goat cheese added some tartness and the rosemary grounded the entire dish. The addition of chicken actually makes this into a meal. I would have liked some texture (buttery crumble on top or some crispy bacon?) as it was a bit mushy, but hell, it was mac and cheese.

Pork Tartine - This was a special and is not listed on the standard HH menu. Basically an open-faced sandwich on half a baguette, covered in pork of various incarnations - pork belly and bacon I think. Smeared with pork fat, melted Gruyere cheese, pickled onions, arugula. A small tasting portion when split. As a full sandwich this would be stellar.

We had a good experience with Lolita. She treated us well during our visit. The food was tasty, service, at least at the bar, was very attentive and congenial. I can't say I was thrown back in my seat by anything but if you've got an out-of-towner on your guest list I'd recommend you bring them here for a taste of gentrified Cleveland. Oh, the check. $31. I think that's about as cheap as you'll get away with here."}
{"text":"My boyfriend wanted to take me here for my birthday since I'm fairly new to Cleveland. He made reservations 2 weeks up front, our table got bumped despite being 10 minutes early and we were left at the bar for about 50 minutes. I was so hungry by the time they finally got around to seating us I already wanted to just leave. The worst part is they were aware it was my birthday, and made no efforts to improve the situation. The waiter was great, we ordered the typical three courses and the food was pretty good, but when the bill came we weren't even comped desserts, or even a drink for that matter. I've worked in high end dining, and for a maitre de to let that happen is, well.. not doing your job. If you can't keep a reservation, you call the clients- period. 

They'll just always be that restaurant that wrecked my 24th birthday, and didn't even give a s***. Now when we're in that neighborhood for a concert, I just stay at the House of Blues. At least  I don't leave feeling worse than when I walked in. lol"}
{"text":"I was foolish enough to come on a Friday night with a party of four and no reservation. I guess I thought it wouldn't be a problem? We ended up sitting at the bar and had a great time and amazing service. I loved the ginger infused vodka - they make it themselves- and it's fantastic. 

The place has a great ambiance and reminds me of a place I'd go to in New York City -not my hometown of Cleveland. Come on Michael Symon quit making things there so posh- my mom might try to use it as leverage for me to move home.

Oh and I think as to be expected - the food was fantastic and super cheap. Four people for dinner and drinks at $100 is amazing in my book."}
{"text":"I can finally say that this is the best place for drinks and food in Tremont after visiting it over a dozen times. By far my favorite here is their happy hour menu. The happy hour food selection is great and you just can't beat the tasty Beta drinks! Best of all, they have happy hour twice a day! The Lolita burger and the 1/2 mac and cheese are my favorites. The burgers are juicy and topped with an over-easy egg. The goat cheese combination in the mac is just out of this world. Just the right amount of goat cheese that is not overpowering. Where else can you get a tastier burger or mac & cheese?

The bartenders are also very friendly and service is very good in the dining room. I've been here several times for dinner and it's been quite consistent in taste, quality, and service. My favorite entree remains to be the pork chops. Tender cuts of pork chops grilled to perfection. The chicken livers are also very delicious as a starter. Between Michael Symon's restaurants in the Cleveland area, this would be my choice."}
{"text":"This a small, dark venue, but a trendy one and located in the chic, trendy Tremont neighborhood near downtown.  They have an open kitchen format.  It's a relatively small space also, so reservations are a must.  We had three starter plates and their duck confit entrée.    The starters were the roasted bone marrow, mussels, and crispy pigtails and ears. The piggy dish had a nice sweet and sour type flavor to it.  The bone marrow is slimy and takes getting used to if you have not had it before (probably like raw oyster to a newcomer).  The duck was delicious (as were all the dishes except maybe the bone  marrow) and it had a nice white cream with it, which we learned was a celery puree of some sort.  Iron Chef Michael Symon has a great touch with flavors and tastes from our experience here and at Lola.   The meal here was a great value also at $44 for all 4 plates ($8 each for the large starters)."}
{"text":"I'm going to have to channel Penny from Happy Endings here.  Lolita was AH-MUH-zing!!  I never knew who Michael Symon was and I frankly didn't give two hoots that he was an iron chef, or top chef, or whatever.  But my sweetie had been to Lolita before and he thought it would be a great place for a romantic dinner for two.  So, off we went!  

Here is how it breaks down:
STARTERS:  Seems to be the best part of the menu!  So many fantastic choices, was hard to choose!  We finally settled on the bone marrow and the mussels and we were NOT disappointed.  The marrow was a tad salty, but the mussels were just...heavenly.

ENTREES: I had the sirloin with the polenta on the side. The sirloin was outstanding...and I'm not even a meat person.  And the polenta was just rich!

DESSERT:  We had the gelato and it was amazing, it was chocolate and some other flavor (the name escapes me) mixed together and I loved it!  

Some other things I like:  service was gracious, quick and attentive.  I also love the ambience.  When we arrived it was a bit on the noisier sound (the layout of the room allows noise to reverberate but by the time we had settled into our meal, the noise level was just about it.  Adding to the ambience were the two people seated next to us who were on their first date.  I had fun eavesdropping on their conversation.  My verdict: He's NOT that into you. ;)

Things I didn't like (hence the missing star);
--  got the Washington Syrah and it tasted awful. It was rather acidic and it tasted like the wine hadn't (or wouldn't) settle.   But I also claim responsibility for this, what they heck was I doing drinking wine from Washington when there were Bordeauxs and Malbecs on the wine list??
-- The arctic temperature!  It was a little chilly when we stepped in but I had my scarf so no worries. But the temperature kept decreasing until even my husband had to say he was cold. You know that's cold.  

Conclusion:  Go to Lolita you won't regret, but make sure you bring a sweater."}
{"text":"Dined at Lolita with my husband and another couple on a recent trip to Cleveland.  The 4 of us absolutely adored Lolita. Everything was perfect. I loved the casual atmosphere and the swanky decor. We all agreed our waitress rocked when she took a lot of time going over the beer list, and different menu items. 

The appetizers - mussels for the guys and some super yummy prosciutto for the girls were gobbled up and we all anxiously awaited our entrees. Timing of the meal was perfect. Everyone was really pleased with what they ordered, especially me with the Tagliatelle with wild mushrooms! Other meals included duck which was fall off the bone tender and yummy, pork chop (because someone just had to get pork at Michael Symons place - it would have been wrong not to), which was gnaw off the bone good, and  my g/f had the goat cheese mac and cheese (and the only really small complaint of the evening that the portion of the mac and cheese was pretty skimpy).

Dessert was equally as good - a chocolate bread pudding and an apple tart. One of the very best things about Lolita was the amazing mix of classic rock that played throughout the entire night. Smart phones were brought out on more than one occasion when the artist could not be named. As we were going to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame the next day, the music selection was super fun for us."}
{"text":"Nice environment for an evening, good lighting and that right balance between good music and reasonable volume to talk. Good selection of wines by the glass. I had the octopus as appetizer, the presentation of the plate was good but the octopus was a bit overcooked. For my main I had the hanger steak, the steak was well cooked with an interesting sauce made of onions, peppers and some kind of chimichurri. My experience with service was OK, my waitress has efficient but could have done better at connecting  with clients and guiding through the menu. Overall good place if you're in town with friends or  work colleagues but not necessarily THE place for that special occasion..."}
{"text":"I Do Not Recommend This Place!!!
Seriously less than impressed for this dining experience. Making a reservation for 5 was easy and the earlier party cancelled which was nice. The restaurant itself is kind of small and dark and very loud, I had to yell to my dad who sat across from me. Now the food we ordered:

Crispy pig tails and ears- skinny crunchy thin sliced ears that were OK and pig tails covered in fat. You eat the tails with hands because there is a large bone and the pork flavor comes through... Def not worth ordering again
Bone marrow- my first time having it so I didn't realize how small of a portion it was. Scooping out melted fat was oh so fun sharing with 5 people. The flavor was interesting but def super salty. My fav part was the pickled side 
Mussels- undercooked. Sauce with meat was slightly spicy and was the only redeeming quality of the dish. Plus half my mussels didn't open so I only ate half the dish. What a waste!
My parents got pizza the mushroom and rhamp. Not worth it!!! Def had better pizza at dominos! The rhamp I almost choked on! It was black and difficult to chew so you basically had no option than to swallow it. My grandma kept commenting on the pizza being super burnt and that it was.
Grandma got the crab fetto something and there was maybe a baby crab worth of meat on it. I didn't even spot any scallops. The heaping pile of bland pasta was left on the plate. 
My brother got the chicken and barely touched it so I'm assuming it wasn't great either. 

Service- my waitress with the pigtails and large tattoo on her left arm barely checked on us. I had to walk up to her asking about our order because it was an hour after our appetizers were done. She then rushed all our orders and pretty much threw them on the table. I shouldn't have tipped her well but seeing how crappy this restaurant is, doubt she'll have a job much longer.

I expected so much more from this place after reading the reviews and knowing it is by Michael Symon but really??? I spent so much on a graduation dinner for my brother for a meal that left me hungry and pissed off. I was embarrassed that this \"upscale\" restaurant had my family begging to go to Bob Evans instead. Def don't recommend this place!!!!I"}
{"text":"Have never had a bad meal here. I don't want to delve too much into the menu but their pizzas are great as well as the entrees. What really jumps out at me in the meat boards.  Charcuterie is hip. Right? Symon does it perfectly here."}
{"text":"I honestly liked this better than Lola, both in terms of ambiance, price and quality.  Completely different restaurant, but the same attention to quality and detail and outstanding cocktails."}
{"text":"Awesome service and probably the best meal I've had in Cleveland! Try thee brussel sprouts!"}
{"text":"It's hard to fault anything Michael Symon does and my recent stop in to this Tremont establishment was superb. We decided to start our meal with two appetizers and being the adventurous people we are we went with the crispy pig tails & ears along with the bruschetta which featured a duck liver spread. The pig tails & ears were interesting to say the least, although the pigs ears basically just tasted like a chicken wing with a tangy sauce. The bruschetta was delicious, but the smell of the duck liver left much to be desired.

Moving on to the entree, I decided to go with the risotto which featured calamari and bone marrow. The dish was incredibly rich and some of the most complete flavors I've ever tasted. My girlfriend went with the linguini that was loaded with clams and crunchy bread crumbs. Both were very solid and enjoyable. The price was high as is to be expected at a restaurants of the caliber of Michael Symon. My only qualms are that the menu is slightly limited and didn't leave me much reason to come back multiple times.

Overall, if you've never been you have to go at least once and let your palate roam, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I was here on a business dinner and we tried a variety of food and all was great.  Each dish was well made and blend together very well.  Great fresh ingredients mixed with skill.  We loved the brussel sprouts, I did not know they could taste great.  The dates were wonderful.  Every dish was familiar, but unique."}
{"text":"Stars: 4+

Pros: 
Happy hour at Lolita is hard to beat. The main dishes (at least for that night...not sure if it changes) was the Lolita burger, eggplant dip, mussels, roasted brussel sprouts, and mac and cheese. Each one was 5 dollars.

For a 5 buck burger, the lolita burger comes with a thick meat patty, caramelized onions, an over easy egg, all on top of an english muffin. I think they could have put a bit more sauce on the burger, as it was a bit dry. Otherwise, it was rather delicious.

The mussels were cooked in a sausage-style sauce. Tasty. ESPECIALLY if you ask for more bread and dip the bread the in sauce. Sauce was great, mussels themselves, well, tasted like mussels you would get anywhere else.

Eggplant dip was probably the best I dip I have had in a while. Great texture, a bit creamy and soft, but not overdone. The taste is a very fresh and light taste, sorta the way I like it best. Not at all like some of the heavier cheese dips you find elsewhere.


Cons: 
This place took forever to get to with the traffic.
Sometimes, the place can feel a bit tiny, but I was looking around to see the seating arrangements, and while the bar stools were few in number, the tables were a good size."}
{"text":"Very, very solid dining.  Good Tremont atmosphere with the brick walls,  open kitchen, hard wood floors, with an interesting contemporary layout. Service professional.  Great apps.  Eggplant dip a winner.  The lamb/pasta dish great. I suggest you split that."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure that if you don't like to waste any part of an animal, Lolita will be your carnivore kingdom of om-nom-nom-ness. (That's a technical term, don't question it.)

This gal has been spoiling herself to Lolita since it was suggested by a fellow Clevelanders year ago, and you know what? I've been served up the most consistently incredible meals of my adult life. I'm no food critic or connoisseur of any kind. I've traveled, appreciated the best of the best and I still love Lolita. Argue with me if you want, I know what I like and people from all over the world agree. 

My most recent trip down to Michael Symon corner in Tremont was with colleagues of mine who love fantastic food as much as I do. Three different palettes, two first timers, one from Chicago, all left extremely pleased and full. 

We came in hungry and our table reflected that... in fact, I'm pretty sure there was enough food to feed a small army. Seriously, vegans and vegetarians would have fainted if they saw the meat-eater's buffet sitting in front of us. To start, I dared to try bone marrow for the first time in my life. Mind you, I normally get freaked out by anything that still has bone in it--so, this was a bit of a shock for me. With much convincing from my trustworthy gal-pals, I smeared some on some grilled bread and crunched in. Not bad!! I probably wouldn't order it again, but I'm glad that I gave it a shot.

Then came my main course, which was the tender, juicy hanger steak stacked over chick peas and pickled onions. I have to admit, this is my typical order. I'm a creature of habit. But damn is it good! Order up a side of Lolita's polenta with mascarpone and you'll be basking in the rich decadence of an incredible meal. 

Luckily my colleagues love to share and trust me, I took full advantage of this fact. First of all, I don't eat pork or any kind, but Micheal Symon knows how to make a damn good pork chop. I never knew they could taste so good. Then I got to try a piece of the juiciest, most flavorful roasted chicken I've ever consumed at a restaurant. Just know that if you order this dish, you'll get half of a bird on your plate. No joke, this serving is beyond ginormous. Did I mention I also savored the most incredible brussel sprouts of my life? Oh, well I did. And it was right here. 

Lolita makes me happy. Lolita makes my visitors from out of town happy, even from Chicago. That's enough for me!"}
{"text":"Its pretty hard to dislike any of Michael Simons restaurants. This place is great the atmosphere and the food. Gets me excited typing this  and i ate there a month ago. Have eaten there twice and i will be back for more. Couple things that are really sticking out from the menu was the Brussels sprouts and the charcuterie board. If you like lola you will be in love with lolita."}
{"text":"My wife and I went on a little get away to Cleveland, and there is no way I could come to town without going to one of Michael Symon's  restaurants!  Lolita is in kind of a Bohemian area with little shops and few other places to eat.  There were also a few other local watering holes.

We were planning on going for a late lunch at Lucky's down the street, but they stop serving food at 3 (fyi).  We decided to go to a local bar down the street, and wait for Lolita to open at 4.  The reason that this is important is I was not dressed for a nice dinner place, so I was a little worried.  As we were walking in a guy was sweeping the front steps, and I asked him if they had a dress code.  He laughed and said that I was fine.  

My wife and I got the baked dates with bacon and a ricotta dip.  Yep that's right two appetizers  for two people!  They were both very very very good!  I had the lamb and my wife had the gnocchi.  They were both as good as it gets!!!!  The lamb was $18 and the gnocchi was $15!  That is soooooooo cheap!  In Chicago my lamb would have been $28 and it would have been a third of the size!     

They have a good beer and wine list.  I had a Belgian Lager that I have never had.  I can't remember the name(great info right).  Something else to keep in mind for any out of towners.  I guess in Cleveland you can't get hard alcohol on Sundays.  Nothing like pointless laws that only apply one day a week!  

If anyone out there knows Michael Symon, can you tell him to open a restaurant in Chicago.    How about Riverside!!!  I would be there once a week."}
{"text":"So this is definitely in the gay part of town (heyyyyyy!).  I was just passing through Cleveland (from Chicago on the way to Philly) and had no idea where I was going other than the whole Michael Symon thing, but it was a pleasant surprise because I love me a good gayborhood bar.  

The bartender was super cool.  He even admitted that the TVs were stuck on the Food Network because it was \"strongly encouraged\" by management.  I didn't mind though, who doesn't love to watch delicious things being created while eating other delicious things right in front of you?  

I had the mussels, they were great.  Also a glass of red that the bartender recommended, and it was by far the best of the four glasses I had that night (one at each of four bars I chose to christen myself in Cleve-town with).  And the company was great - friendly gay at the bar who broke the news to me about poor beautiful Liz Taylor's passing.  We chatted for a few hours and it was quite the lovely ending to an epic night."}
{"text":"The words \"cheap\" and \"good food\" don't usually go together, but at Lolita they go hand in hand when happy hour begins. 

The happy hour is one of the best in town. The selections they offer for only $5 is CRAZY.  Do yourself a solid and get the fried brussels sprouts and burger for only $5 each! Also, the roasted bone marrow is not on the happy hour list, but you need to get those too!  

Hurry up and take advantage of this happy hour before Michael Symon wises up and realizes he's giving his food away."}
{"text":"My dinner at Lolita was fantastic and cemented the location as my favorite of Michael Symon's local eateries.  Jumping right into the food, the Roasted Bone Marrow appetizer was phenomenal--highlighted by the perfectly grilled bread which gives you just a touch of crispiness followed by total capitulation to the roasted marrow and your palate.  I recall the now-defunct Bar Symon had a scaled-down version of this appetizer that was nowhere near in the same class as this dish.  The Roasted Dates were also very good (not quite as good as the bone marrow, but hey) with the almonds, bacon, and chiles complementing the controlled sweetness of the dates.

The Roasted Chicken was solid, but wouldn't challenge Greenhouse Tavern's superb \"40 Clove\" roasted chicken.  The meat was adequately juicy and, to its credit, the skin was nice and crispy.  I differ from a lot of the other reviewers on the Fried Brussels Sprouts, which seemed overcooked.  I don't think the texture change or the addition of walnuts really added any value to the side dish.

I liked the layout of the restaurant.  While you might go to Lola for a business lunch, Lolita fits the bill for having an enjoyable dinner with friends.  The intimate dining area manages to work with its small spaces without making diners feel cramped together, though the noise level is pretty high from the surrounding din of conversation.  Lolita features a full bar with a couple feature drinks, a nice selection of beers, and a serviceable wine selection mostly in the $40 - $60 per bottle range."}
{"text":"this was my first time to cleveland, and i have to say that the city is too quiet for a city! lolita's is in the historic district, which is supposedly to be a more lively area of the city. man - it felt a little bit like ghost town in comparison to DC. however, when we walked into lolita's, it was pretty lively. there were several empty tables, but the waitresses wouldnt seat us and said there were only seats at the bar. I guess you have to make a reservation before hand... luckily there were two open spots at the bar. the bartender was nice and friendly, and easy to talk to and everyone that sat around us was very friendly. 

food: 
duck meatballs - moist and delicious. it was good, but the marinara sauce on it was so plain and regular that it lost points for me there. 
mussels - ehhh... there was still sand in my mussels. i hate places who dont let them soak in water before cooking to get rid of the sand. 
porcini crusted sirloin - cooked to perfection, but i got really full on the apps that i didnt have much room for the steak. 
fried brussels sprouts - HOLY MOLY. BEST SIDE EVER. never thought that brussel sprouts could taste so freakin delicious, but they did. AMAZING. the entree with the side was worth 4 stars on its own. 

i really wish i couldve tasted more items... but i was just too full to eat anymore. Chef Symon definitely has a good feel for ingredients and flavors... def worth a visit."}
{"text":"Food: very good overall.  The best part of the menu are the appetizers/cured meats, IMO.  We shared the venison carpaccio (didn't eat enough to rate), crispy pig tails and ears (very good), roasted bone marrow (tasty), and the Big Board (very, very good).  I had the Buccatini for the main, and it was solid, but not life-changing.  My wife's Mushroom Pizza was better.

Drinks: good selection of craft beers.  My buddy and I had a couple of the Founders Dirty Bastard.  Pretty solid wine menu.

Service: very good.  Our waiter was personable, and considering how busy it was, our food got to the table in a respectable amount of time.

Ambiance: very dark inside the restaurant, but for a Saturday night, that was the right vibe.

The prices are reasonable considering the quality of the food.  Definitely worth a visit if you've never been here."}
{"text":"There are a lot of great review's on Yelp about Lolita and it definitely lived up to it's name.  I had an amazing meal at Lolita over the weekend.  We started with the Mussels with chorizo in a white wine sauce.  They were perfectly cooked and I liked the balance between the spicy chorizo and the mussels.  We also had the Truffled Mortadella as a starter and I loved it!  The mortadella came with crostini, pickled cucumbers and green tomatoes, and some candied raisins and fruit.  

Because of all the outstanding reviews on Yelp, I knew I had to order the Pork Chop to see what all the fuss was about.  Holy moly!  The pork chop was juicy and tender and oh so delicious!  Honestly it's one of the best pork chops I've ever eaten and definitely recommend ordering it if you're at Lolita.  

My only disappointment was the fried brussels sprouts.  I love brussels sprouts and often roast them in the oven at home.  The sprouts were drenched in a sauce and were not very crispy.  I also found them to be very tangy and salty from the anchovy.  

Overall, I really enjoyed my meal at Lolita.  We had great food and good service."}
{"text":"Just popped in for happy hour.  They open at 5, I got the last 2 bar seats at 5:02.  They have Ommegang rare Vos, yummy beer.  I got the mussels which were good, a hint of cinnamon, but the Bone Marrow is out of this world!  They cut the bone in half long ways before cooking.  Why doesn't everyone do that??"}
{"text":"This is a fun little spot not too far from the middle of the city.  The drinks and appetizers are tastey and well portioned.  The seating is limited, but the ambience is nice for intimate dates or meetings."}
{"text":"First time visiting Cleveland and what a delight to find two of Chef Simon's restaurants here. We sadly missed our 5:30 reservation and had to sit at the bar (but made it just in time for the happy hour specials). 

I ordered the mussels off the HH menu. The mussels were good but on the smaller side. But the sauce was delicious with flavors of cumin & curry.  Sadly, the mussels didn't come with fries or bread so I couldn't enjoy the broth more. 

The seafood stew was wonderful and a dream for a seafood lover as it had octopus, squid, mussels, clams, and shrimp. You can also choose a side, and I opted for the polenta with mascarpone cheese. FULL of umami flavor and yet so rich at the same time. It was more grits-based than other log-form polenta I had before. 

Lolita really lived up to my expectations of Chef Simon's cuisine - clean, flavorful, and complete!"}
{"text":"I will make this simple. I was completely impressed by the entire experience from food, drinks, service, music and cleanliness of the restaurant. I don't like to hand out 5 stars. A business really has to earn it to receive the best rating. Lolita did that."}
{"text":"Michael Symon, you REALLY rock!! My second time here, once for happy hour and once for a romantic date night with my boy.

Let's start with saying this restaurant is so unique in that it's a perfect atmosphere for happy hour with friends and a romantic dinner date with your S.O.s (significant others). Around 6pm, this place is crowded with young professionals looking to hang out and suddenly at night, it transforms into this candlelight dinner place. 

Happy Hour: Mussels and 1/2 mac & cheese. YUM YUM YUM. Great amount of mussels for the price and a unique flavor for the mac & cheese. BANG FOR YOUR BUCK, definitely. The martini is also delicious!! Totally worth it. 

Dinner: Maple Glazed Pork Belly, Duck Confit, and Porcini Crusted Sirloin. If I had to rank the three, it would be: Duck Confit, Porcini Sirloin, then Pork Belly. 

I wasn't huge on the pork belly only because I wished the pork was tender throughout instead of having the sides of the pork be alittle crusty (though it was intended that way). My bf though, loved the pork belly.

Sirloin: my only negativeness of it was that the sides of the sirloin were a bit too crusted and a tad overcook. But the middle slices of the sirloin were soooooo good i was devouring my dish! The duck confit was amazyingggg... the meat was so tender it came off the duck so easily. In addition, it was a good amount of duck meat.

Because of how much I loved Lolita, I'm excited to try Lola's now!! 

Michael Symon, thanks for a great experience! Now, go open more restaurants in Cleveland!!!"}
{"text":"I'm never really sure what to expect from an American Bistro. Luckily, Lolita doesn't disappoint. The pasta is awesome and the hangar steak was delicious. Now $65 is pricey and don't worry you won't be loosening your belt. Lolita is a true gourmet restaurant. The portions are small and the prices are high. But the food is well worth it. Would definitely like to try the pizza next time."}
{"text":"All hype. That is the best way I can sum it up.

The place was packed when we went (and I assume is the norm). The decor is contemporary, and sort of retro with a modern flare, if that makes sense. Not sure if they were going for intimate, but the place was very dimly lit. I could barely read the menu, but I guess I do have bad eyes. Nothing the flashlight app on my phone couldn't fix.

Service was OK, nothing stood out good or bad.

As for the food, I thought it was a big disappointment after hearing about what a big deal Michael Symon was in Cleveland. I ordered the Duck Confit and sampled the Chicken and Sirloin from other members of my party. I found everything to be unspectacular, given all the hoopla and more importantly, the price point. Portions were small, and there was nothing special about the preparation of the food.  The one thing I did enjoy was the polenta side. Flavorful and \"comfort food-y\", I traded some of my entree for other people's polenta bowls. I think that speaks more about the duck confit than the polenta. I also tried the brussel sprouts and potato sides, both of which were overseasoned and oily to the point where my face cringed.

Cocktails weren't great either. I had the Sin Gin & Tonic, and it had this funky taste to it that made it hard to finish. I don't think it was the cucumber, so maybe it was the Hendrick's gin... maybe.

I don't get the buzz about this place, and I'm a little more hesitant now to try his other restaurants. I seem to be in the minority here, or maybe I fell a bit too deep in the hype, but temper your expectations if it's your first time."}
{"text":"We checked this place out on our way out of town back to Chicago and I'm glad we didn't pass on it like we almost did after boozing it up at The Treehouse a few doors down.

Everything was excellent.  We tried one thing from almost every section of the menu and they were all very tasty, well prepared and well portioned.

The pizza we had was great and definitely a good size for one person.  The Mussels were excellent as well, the sausage that comes in the broth was so tasty.  We also got the Lamb Kabobs which were very good but nothing out of this world.  The Mac & Cheese was by far the crown jewel of the experience, along with \"The Prisoner\" red wind we were drinking.  

Everything was great, even got some Mac & Cheese to go for my sister in Chicago.  Next time we are in Cleveland we will definitely be back.

Lolita you wicked temptress.

{"text":"So after having been to Lola and B spot several times, I finally had a chance to give Lolita a try.  I came here for dinner, although the restaurant was bustling with people trying to get a spot at the bar for happy hour at the time.  The restaurant seemed chic in appearance, although a bit crowded (probably because of the aforementioned happy hour).  I came with a group of friends, and we started with some appetizers that were recommended by those who had been here before.  We ordered the bone marrow, the pork belly, and the fried brussel sprouts.  All of the appetizers were beautiful and scrumptious.  The bone marrow had a gelatinous quality and a subtle flavor and came with some toast to spread it on.  I was not a big fan of its unique texture, although I did feel it was seasoned well.  The pork belly was fantastic, with the fatty meat cooked so that it would melt in your mouth as you ate it.  The brussel sprouts were also great, fried with some crispiness at the edges and flavored with a delicious vinaigrette.  For my entree, I ordered the duck confit.  The duck was cooked well and was served with a vinagrette along with some squash puree.  The dish was tasty, although perhaps flavored with a bit too much vinegar, and not quite as impressive as the appetizers we ordered.  As a side, I ordered the cauliflower gratin, which was cheesy and flavorful.  Overall, the meal was quite filling and very good.  I found the appetizers to be very impressive and the entree to be fitting for the restaurant.  My understanding is that the happy hour here is really good, especially because many of these appetizers are offered at a lower price while at the bar.  I may have to give it a try another time when the bar isn't quite as crowded.  Thus, I'm really glad I came to Lolita!  It was a good time, and I really enjoyed the food here."}
{"text":"This a gem in tremont.  I've been frequenting this place for years.  I love that every time I visit, it feels like a special occasion.  The roasted chicken is delicious.  The side of fried brussell sprouts is amazing."}
{"text":"Since my first visit I've returned at least 5 times and every single time Lolita fails to disappoint me. Consistency at its finest. My new loves: crispy chicken livers and the pork chop milanese. Oh man, that pork chop. Go ahead and try the bone marrow - I brought my meat-lovin' dad here and when he took his first bite of the fatty melt-in-your-mouth goodness I swear he looked like the happiest man alive. I did good."}
{"text":"I liked Lolita.  Considering my love for Michael Simon I was surprised I didn't love Lolita.  But sadly, Mikey, I just wasnt blown away.  The first few drinks we had were so weak, it was like one of those jokes of a happy hour.  I appreciate a good price tag for happy hour, but if I have to order a stiff martini to chase it down?  Not as much.  

We had the pigs ears, the brussel sprouts, the pork chop and the steak.  They were all ok, but I also felt they were too salty and too greasy.  Considering the positive reviews I would so give Lolita another chance, but I need to be wowed.  Otherwise, I could just go back to Lola.  Which was my first true love anyways."}
{"text":"Husband thought the brussels sprouts rocked, I personally love the bone marrow. The pork chop was the best I have ever had and I have eaten quite a few in my time very impressive.  Even the polenta is worth repeating!

The atmosphere is very nice and the waitstaff was very helpful and friendly so were the other diners who we had great conversations with. I am sure we will go back as there are many other dishes to try!"}
{"text":"This is the famous Iron Chef restaurant in Cleveland.

As soon as you walk into the restaurant, you notice the decor is trendy with good atmosphere and an open kitchen.

Pate Plate - wonderful pate of duck, foie gras that blast in your mouth.  This was my favorite dish of the day.  The flavors are accentuated with a glass of red wine, which our waiter had recommended.

Duck Confit - crispy on the outside and very tender in the inside.  Good balance of flavor.  And it comes with Brussels sprouts, which are simply amazing.

Pull pork pasta - not bad, but it didn't wow me.

Yes, they also have happy hour!  I have yet to try that 5$ burger has received very wonderful reviews among yelp.

On a side note, you definitely want to make a reservation before hand.  It is a small restaurant and it was filled of people, many waiting for a seat, on a Saturday evening (as expected)."}
{"text":"I was so excited for Michael Symon's Lolita but it was sorta a let down!  It was good, but not great.

The building itself is somewhat small.  Not a lot of tables. So you should definitely call for a reservation.  Also the day we went the air conditioning wasn't working.  I guess I shouldn't fault them too much for that but it got pretty warm in there! Thankfully we went on a cool night.

We ordered the warm olives (which were actually more like \"Surprisingly Hot Olives\") and the buschetta which was not your traditional bruschetta.  It had arugula, white beans, and shredded pecorino cheese.  It was actually one of my favorite things I ate.

My Dad got the tomato pizza, which was just ok.  My mom got their summer special pasta which was delicious but tasted exactly the way my mom makes it.  I had the buccatini which was good, not great.  I liked the thick spaghetti.

Not a big dessert menu which is ok.  Cake, gelato, not much else.

The have Victory Brewery bottles.  Awesome."}
{"text":"Anytime I've gone to Lolita I order from the bar menu.  Everything looks tasty on this smaller menu, and I enjoy the smaller portions.  More importantly I wanted to write about a life-changing event: eating Chef Symon's fried brussel sprouts.  I'm not an anchovy fan, so I won't lie: I was afraid to try them...but when you know who is the chef behind the recipe, I knew I could put my trust in Chef Symon.  I mustered up all of my courage to take that first bite, and good golly I'm glad I did.  Salty with that hint of sour from the vinegar...absolutely fantastic.  Since then, I've tried a number of brussel sprouts sides, but my taste buds still cry out for Chef Symon's fried brussel sprouts.  Go there on your next happy hour!"}
{"text":"My husband took me here for my birthday. It was fabulous.

I always want to let people know, we are vegetarian so everything we eat is veggie...so take that into consideration. 

Ok, so the margarita on the rocks was divine. I have had sooo many crappy margaritas in this city (excluding Lopez on Lee, their's are good.) So onto the meal.

We got the bruschetta to start the meal. I'm assuming it's baked garlic spread over perfect bread with fresh cheese melted on top. Man, they know how to flavor some garlic for a girl. Scrumptious!

Then my husband got the mushroom pizza and I picked the butternut squash ravioli. Nothing bad to say here. The ravioli was cooked to perfection, the squash...buttery. Little to no sauce on top the little ravi's just danced in some yummy concoction with walnuts and baked seasonings. I don't know how to do this any better. I'm serious. It was perfect.

Dessert was yums as well, we got some lemon thingy that had fresh blueberries and blackberries atop. 

I can't stress how great the food was. It was reasonably priced for an upscale joint and the service was great. The girl at the front was a little snooty, but whatevs."}
{"text":"As good as Lola was, I actually liked the food here a bit more. Crispy pig's ears and tail stole the show - amazing asian-y flavor, so tender and crispy at once. Lamb cavatelli was like spring on a plate, so nicely balanced. Service was first rate. The whole experience exceeded my inflated expectations. $50 + tip for three courses and wine - a deal for this level of quality."}
{"text":"Food very good! Waitress poor! Took forever to get our ticket! Waitress visiting with friends at bar!  My husband had to go and track her down to get our bill! Then she went and waited on another table, she never brought our bill to us!  We were done eating for over 20 minutes before we got our bill! Manager came and talked with us. Waitress totally ignored us, never came back to our table. Manager comped our appetizer. Totally excited to eat at Michael Symons's restaurant! Very disappointed when we left!"}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I were visiting one of our closest friends in Cleveland and we decided early on in the trip that we would eat at Lolita! It was our very first time at Lolita and we were so glad that we were able to make it to the late night happy hour. 

I absolutely love the decor and ambiance of the restaurant. It has the beautiful fine dining atmosphere without the snobby and pretentious service. The bartender was amazing. He made our drinks strong and engaged in a very animated conversation with us. We really enjoyed his banter and suggestions about where to get late late night drinks. 

We decided to get the food on the Happy Hour menu since it was such a good deal. $5 for each of the food items and $3-5 each for beers, margaritas, & other mixed drinks! 

Burger: Three of us girls, including me, got the burger with the fried egg. My burger was seasoned and cooked perfectly! Hands down, one of the top burgers I have ever had. I definitely got lucky though, because two of the other girls' burger patties were a bit too salty. They were a bit disappointed, but I really enjoyed my burger very much. 

Fried brussels sprouts: OMGG these were so delicious. I never thought that I could like vegetables so much. It had great textures and was balanced in its flavors and seasonings. I really enjoyed the hint of acidity and savoriness of the brussels sprouts. 

Mussels: These were swimming in a flavorful redish-orangey sauce. I wish I had some bread to soak up some of that yummy sauce!

Mac & Cheese: Yummy! I am not a fan of goat cheese, and this dish did have a good amount of goat cheese in it, but I couldn't stop eating it! I didn't think the goat's cheese was overwhelming at all. 

What an amazing experience,-wonderful food and service in a sophisticated atmosphere! I will return to try their dinner entrees next time I visit my friend again! Counting down the days!"}
{"text":"The crispy pigs ears and tails were fantastic. The \"signature\" goat cheese mac and cheese was... bland? My husband made a \"tuna helper\" comment but I didn't think it was that bad, just not to the level of the other dishes we had. Everything else was just amazing. Don't you dare come to this place without eating at least one order of the brussel sprouts. don't be scared of anchovies, they don't bite. this was my first Anchovy Experience. Yum."}
{"text":"Great date night for those of us who can't afford Lola! 

Lolita opened my eyes to the \"utilize the whole Buffalo\" mentality in upscale food. I would never think to order \"crispy pig tails and ears,\" but I did, and boy was I sold! They were a lot like extra crispy chicken wings, and they were DELICIOUS. Next time, I'll probably try the marrow, but I have yet to work up the cojones for that. 

My only complaint would be that the restaurant isn't particularly well-lit, and its fairly small, so I wouldn't suggest bringing a large party.

Overall, the food is just phenomenal. The martinis are exceptional."}
{"text":"I just want to give Lolita kudos yet again. I'm preggo and feel like an alien when we go out, especially since I don't look huge yet and they always ask if I'd like to start with a cocktail. Well the smart people at Lolita have a Maternity Martini in their cocktail menu and it made me feel less like an alien and more like the girl I used to be. THANK YOU!!!

On a food note: I had the pork chop, and we started with the figs, so delish. Hubby got the steak and unfortunately the salad it came with was WAY overdressed, but after we alerted them they quickly replaced it and gave him another salad. Brussel Sprouts are still a winner but the duck fat potatoes were lackluster."}
{"text":"I really like the various changes that they have made here. The current menu is much more appealing to me than some of their previous ones. All of the dishes are very well made, one would expect no less from Cleveland's reigning Iron Chef, partcularly the pizzas. The only thing that is not that great is that the menu is quite limited so I would definately suggest checking out the current version before going. It is very well run and the service is on point."}
{"text":"SIX STARS. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE, I WANT TO GIVE A RESTAURANT SIX STARS. And considering in the past week I've eaten at both Morton's Steakhouse and Ruth's Chris...and I have written a whole slew of five-star restaurant reviews to date...I think that's really saying something. Michael Symon, you are amazing.

It didn't start out perfectly, however, as we had an 8pm reservation, arrived at 7:50, but weren't seated until 8:30--but we did end up with one of the best tables in the place (in a little bit of a corner overlooking the open kitchen). But after that little snafu, it only got better. Well, wait, I take that back - after the introductory bread for the table, it got better. The bread was horribly dry and almost too hard to rip apart--and was barely even chewable. But everything else from then on out overwhelmed me to such an extent that the late seating and bad bread were quickly forgotten.

Our table of four friends are close enough that we agreed to all order different appetizers, split a pizza, then each get different entrees...so that we could all try a bigger variety of dishes. Our friends live there, but we don't, so we aren't likely to be back, probably ever. So we made the best of it. 

So, appetizers: The beets? Good. The fried gizzards? Good, and I've not ever liked gizzards in the past. The mussels? Amazing. Wait--AMAZING! The bone marrow? Good, and I'm glad I tried it, but I probably wouldn't order it again. It had a really nice taste, but was just a bit too greasy (fatty?) for me. The duck prosciutto pizza? The only 'meh' order of the bunch that wasn't worth the price...The egg wasn't bad, but it was strange (and I definitely stayed away from the yolk), there wasn't enough prosciutto on it, and it was really dry.

Entrees? They were all DIVINE. My favorite would be a tie between the beef cheek pappardelle (not mine) and the butternut squash ravioli (not mine). That said, my pork chop was HUGE and perfectly moist and tender and hubby's catch of the day was tasty. 

And the sides? Oh, the sides. There were only four to choose from, but three of us got the brussel sprouts--our friends because they'd had them before and me because I was DYING to try them. And they certainly lived up to their hype. Oh. My. Did they ever. Even my husband who doesn't like brussel sprouts said they were good. It might just have been the best tasting vegetable I've ever eaten, and I've eaten my share of veggies. Yeah, it was so good I even tipped the bowl to my mouth to slurp up every last bit of the liquid. No, my friend thankfully missed that photo opportunity! I was tempted to order another side for dessert...until I saw the dessert menu. But wait, the beans. Hubby got the white beans as his side - and wow, what deep flavors. We were certainly not expecting beans with SO. MUCH. FLAVOR. Whoa.

Toffee? Chocolate? Are you kidding me? Bring it on. Two of us got the sticky toffee pudding and two of us got the chocolate pot du creme. Both were... astounding. Simply delectable. All you could hear at our table was ummmms and ahhhhhs and silverware clinking on plates. 

And really the best thing about the whole night? Aside from experiencing this...this...this...experience with good friends? We weren't overly stuffed at the end and all four of us ate so many courses (plus a bottle of wine and a rum drink) for $200. 

Simply. Amazing.

And like I said, six stars. Well, either that or I have to rethink (rewrite) all of my other five-star reviews...which I really don't feel like doing. 

So my six-star review stands."}
{"text":"Highly recommended by my friend in Cleveland. I seldom try chicken liver and pig ear and tail in an American restaurant. Both of them are a little bit sour for me. But I like the crispy texture and fresh flavor in general. Martini is alright. Rissoto is alright. I would say it's a good place to go with your friends on weekend if you're living in Cleveland. But not something really impressive."}
{"text":"Was passing through to go to Chicago. Was so good. Probably the best muscles I've ever had"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!
The Roasted Bone Marrow starter is a must!  Trust me!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and atmosphere. Appetizers are tremendous including the bone marrow and crispy chicken livers. Pizza is amazing with a thin crispy crust. There's not a bad entree on the menu and would encourage everyone to try the fried brussel sprouts. Definitely a Cleveland staple."}
{"text":"A couple things before I start:

1) Why are we working today?! I say f*ck the Protestant work-ethic and spirit of capitalism, I'm cuttin' out early in the name of Jesus. If he was born yesterday, I'm pretty sure we should still be rejoicing today. Can I getta witness?!;

2) I'm from Fresno, California and have no business pontificating on the culinary front as I do (although we're movin on UP! Max's anyone?!) -- I can't even make an omelet. Fortunately, or unfortunately, my parents think the world of me and that's led me to believe all my thoughts and opinions are solid GOLD, wherein lie the entitled origins of this review...

This place had me at the door. Great ambiance; warm lighting, great light fixtures, flowing fabrics, cozy nooks and crannies. Fantastic staff; unpretentious but professional. I REALLY wanted to be blown away by the food, but there were a few wrinkles:

First, the bread. Like my homegirl said, \"Two words: Olive Garden.\"

We split the roasted fig appys w/ fried pancetta. The figs were a little mushy and there wasn't enough pancetta to add the contrast needed to really nail this dish. I've had better figs taken out of a Costco box, wrapped in Safeway bacon, and then nuked for 10 minutes in the microwave (TM Castro Holiday Party, '05)

Our entree, the beef, was delicious initially but got cold and tough quickly. To be fair, we were really yukkin' it up, but still. On the other hand, the 21-year old next to us (in fur stole and Hope-diamond engagement ring), really seemed to love the pizza (\"Just like in Italy! Remember, honey?\")

Finally, the dessert menu was pretty heavy on the sorbets and gelatos. That's fine, but it's the dead of winter, in the Cleve; we really needed some warm bread-product up in the mix. 

All that being said, Lolita was still a great dining experience. The staff and ambiance are warm and inviting enough to carry the night. And, this is a perfect date option, with 806 down the road for after-dinner black-tea/lychee martinis. Just like in Italy."}
{"text":"Adventurous or not, Lolita provides. But...step outside your comfort zone and you won't regret it.  Brussel sprouts? Amazing.  Over the top flavors, Symon, I love you."}
{"text":"What do you get when you order bone marrow, roasted chicken, hangar steak and pork chops all made from the genius of Michael Symon?... A carnivore's sweetest dream. Even better: the dream was complimented by the most delicious brussel sprouts I've EVER had the pleasure of chewing and the most  heavenly polenta (although it was my first taste, I fell madly in love) worthy of eating as a meal itself. Damn! This meal was amazing.

The beauty of my time at Lolita was that I was able to try bites of everything above thanks to my sharing dinner mates. Sharing is caring after all.

It was actually a night of two firsts. I tried bone marrow for the first time as well. And although I've been intimidated after all these years, the truth is there really isn't anything to be intimidated about! It was actually pretty impressive - taste and presentation - and I'm delighted to report I actually liked it!

This place is perfect for special occasions, meetings, apparently happy hours (although we weren't privy enough to enjoy it due to the long waiting list), and entertaining. Sir Symon, will you marry me?"}
{"text":"I finally made it out to Lolita! It just took me 4 years to do it...eek! But we went all out, since we really wanted to experience all that this restaurant had to offer. I came here with a group of friends on a random weekday evening. It was busy even for a weekday, so it is probably wise to make reservations like we did. It's a nice modern looking restaurant, more cozier than I had imagined. We were seated immediately after arriving, and our beverage orders taken by the lovely staff. 

We ate family style, so I got to try a lot of different dishes. We started off with multiple appetizers: crispy pig ears and tails, mussels and roasted bone marrow. The crispy pig ears and tails were good, some a little over fried, but the parts that weren't hard were still good. The mussels were cooked in a wonderful broth! I'm used to having mussels in some sort of creamy white wine sauce, but this had bits of chorizo which was a nice twist. My favorite was the bone marrow, since I love eating bone marrow!! Spread on crispy bread, it's heavenly!! We also ordered two types of pizzas. My favorite was the tomato pizza. It was light, and the sweetness of the tomato sauce was perfect. The mushroom pizza was ok for me, there was a certain cheese (Taleggio) that was a little too pungent for my liking. If you are a big fan of blue cheese, than you might enjoy this pizza. It also includes sliced peaches, so it was a more fruity sweet pizza. For the other entrees we got the hanger steak, with a side of potato torta. The hanger steak was well cooked and perfect with the light salad and bits of feta cheese. The duck confit was good, with a mix of sweet corn and fruit. I'm not sure what sauce they had on the plate, but a little more would've been nice. It helps mask some of the \"gamey\" flavors from the duck meat. My friend also had the pasta, which was a good option for a vegetarian who is also lactose intolerant. We also got the side of fried brussels sprouts which were VERY addictive. You can just keep popping those suckers in your mouth like candy! It was good food with good service, and I left happy and full. Good job Michael Symon!"}
{"text":"I've had two dinners now at Lolita, and both experiences were similar.  Lolita is a very good restaurant, top-tier for Cleveland, and a place my wife and I plan to frequent in the future.

I will warn people, though, that if you are immune to the fact that Michael Symon is a famous Iron Chef with an almost religious following in this area, Lolita (like Lola) has its shortcomings.

I can't understand how a restaurant can seat you 30 minutes late and then give you horrible pre-meal bread and you give it 6 stars out of 5.  To me, a \"better than 5 star\" rating is reserved for an absolutely perfect, complaint-free experience.

I was also seated late during my first visit, and right on time during my second.  I also was disappointed in the bread, which could rip out a tooth.

The bar staff (Annie and... sorry, don't remember the guy's name) is great.  Very friendly and very willing to help.  The gentleman bartender gave me a wine recommendation based on my love of the 2007 \"The Prisoner\" by Orin Swift, and it was a dud recommendation.  But, I can chalk that up to personal taste.

Where the Lolita experience shines is during the first course.  The dates, the chicken livers, the stuffed pepper, and the beets are all truly outstanding compositions.  Some of the best flavors and textures I've had anywhere, including meals that cost 3-4x.  The chicken livers are pure heaven.

I have had two average to good entrees, now.  I had the hanger steak and the lamb shank at my two visits.

The hanger steak is what you would expect... on the tough side but incredibly flavorful.  I know that the latest trend is to use cheap cuts of meat and to make them shine, and sometimes, this works.  Sometimes, it is merely \"okay.\"  The pile of chickpeas was an eyebrow raiser... lots and lots of chickpeas.  They didn't complement the beef in my own personal opinion, which is worth what you're paying for it!

The lamb shank was tiny and the \"caviar lentils\" were impossible to get on to a fork... I chased them around the bowl my meal was served in all night.  The caviar brine flavor in the lentils (I assumed \"caviar\" designated the size, but it also was an indicator of flavor) overwhelmed the flavor of the lamb shank which was hugely disappointing.  Sorry about the dangling participle... the lamb flavor was great.  The disappointment came from the fact that the lentils had such a strong flavor as to overwhelm the lamb.

The sides are fantastic.  I've now had the brussels sprouts, potatoes, and beans, and they are all wonderful.  The most perfect potatoes you'll ever eat.

We had plans to go to the Velvet Tango Room after dinner, so we did not get dessert on our second visit.  Dessert on the first visit was great.  We had a cherry sorbet and pot du creme, and both were luscious, although nothing terribly innovative, which is OK!

Lolita can be an exceptional value - there wasn't an entree over $19, including the Lake Erie Walleye off-menu special.  I think that if I focused on the first course options after a cocktail at the bar, it'd be a 5-star experience. 

I'm a Michael Symon fan.  But, I have to rate the restaurant on its merits and ignore the fact that Symon has been instrumental in reviving the Cleveland restaurant scene and putting us back on the map.

First Course, I'd give 5 stars.
Main Course, I'd give 3.  Nobody at our table, all 4 of us foodies, were impressed.
Sides, I'd give 5.
Dessert, 4.
Details (seating on time and the awful bread), a 3.

When you are an Iron Chef, the details matter.  

We'll be back again and again, but we'll probably do small plates."}
{"text":"A very \"meh\", pretty disappointing experience. More like a 2.5 but overall, it was closer to a 2 than a 3. 

I live in Seattle where the restaurant scene is booming and am no stranger to overpriced celebrity restaurants. While visiting Cleveland recently, my extended family and I were excited for the chance to eat something a little more upscale - not a lot of options for that in Cleveland.

We had cocktails to start, split an appetizer between two, a bottle of wine and entrees which came to $176 after tip (and that's even with the super duper LOW tax compared to WA state). This was definitely no where close to a $200 meal. Under $100 and I would have said a solid 3 stars, but frankly it wasn't that good. At all. 

Let me start by saying it is in a really cute little neighborhood. Easy to park on the street and easy to find. The staff was not overly friendly, but prompt and polite. The decor is modern and well done - a nice vibe overall.

Starting with the cocktails we quickly found that the bartender was bad. And I mean, every drink tasted vaguely the same, bad. We switched to wine for the rest of the night. And then just our luck, our bottle was corked. :-(  They were very professional about it and let us replace it with another of the same vintage. 

We had a large party and shared a variety of starters. Many at the table loved the eggplant hummus, though I thought it was just OK. The mussels were nicely done, but lacking much of the expected Chorizo. The salad was dull, but the soup had a nice earthy and rustic feel thanks to the fresh porcini mushrooms. 

Next up for entrees, my husband had a medium rare Hangar steak which arrived raw and COLD. After sending back our wine the last thing he wanted to do was send this back, so he huffed it down anyway. It was so tough I spit out my one attempted taste. I had the duck confit which again, was just fine but the flavors were really competing with each other. I prefer duck to have less accompaniments and let the meat stand for itself. The plate was overwhelmed with additions and still fell flat.

I tasted the flat bread pizza and thought it was totally fine for pizza but it was not noteworthy and again - one more disappointment. The soft polenta was fine, and the brussel sprouts had a good flavor but the portion was insane - I could never eat that many in one sitting. 

If you're desperate for an interesting place to eat, I guess...this might be your only option. If you're from out of town I wouldn't bother here - spend your money on richer, cheaper local digs and save the fine dining for another time."}
{"text":"Have I just heard too much about this place?????  Was I just expecting too much???  Alas, I think I was and here are my tasting notes:

Brussel Sprouts:  delicious!  Worth the hype and the addition of anchovy adds a great savory component.

Marrow:  had better, really.  One of the frequent comments on Yelp! was the fact that the dish is served with too much of the salsa verde.  I almost wish I had more.  There was not enough acidity to cut and enhance the fat at all.  And my marrow was more gamey and a little tough than the nice buttery texture I'm otherwise used to.  

Scallops:  really the highlight of my meal.  The shaved celery, raisins, and celery root purée were delicate but went well with the perfectly cooked scallops.  Was annoyed that one scallop (out of the meager five in the dish) was so tiny that it looked like it had been inadvertently halved prior to service.

Mac and cheese:  noodles were perfectly cooked with still enough bite to them.  But really, what does the addition of bland, rotisserie chicken do to the dish?  Nothing.  Really, a good home cook could reproduce this at home.  Why pay $17?

Wine:  selection is good.  We partook of a very nice Montepulciano.  

Service:  unobtrusive and attentive.  A little too eager to take away plates.  Perhaps calm down a bit on that front?

Verdict:  would I go back?  Probably not.  Perhaps give Lola a go next time I guess."}
{"text":"As weird as it may seem, I've been living in Cleveland for 3 years and had still to come to Lolita.

Finally risked it off of my bucket list yesterday (though I believe I'll be back time and time again).

The space is awesome, either staying on the bar or sitting at a table you have a great view of the kitchen area and the pizza oven. 

Food-wise is great, as you'd expect from any Michael Symon's venue. I started with the mussels with chorizo and they were fantastic. Make sure to ask for some bread and drown it inside the mussel sauce, it doesn't get any better!

Then I had the mushroom pizza, which was also amazing. The dough isn't fat and cumbersome and the toppings / cheese proportion is perfect. Also tried the rabbit risotto a friend was having and it was absolutely al dente, which everyone who cooks risotto knows how difficult it is to achieve.

Wine selection, also amazing.

This is without a doubt one of my favorite places in Cleveland and mingles perfectly with the Tremont vibe."}
{"text":"Ummmmm... GROSS!!! I saw with my own eyes that the chef/cook at the open kitchen who was stirring the sauce he was making with a spoon, tasted it, added more seasoning, wiped the spoon with the kitchen towel in his hand, put the SAME spoon back for stirring and pour the sauce on an entree before the waiter took it from the kitchen and served it!!! Is this acceptable? Is this even legal? We went there on Saturday (05/05/12) at around 9:40 pm. He was wearing a red baseball cap. I was stunned. Actually wanted to leave on the spot but my company didn't want to leave so I had to eat there :("}
{"text":"For all of the talk around town about Lolita, I was unimpressed. The service was good, but the food was unimpressive, except the brussel sprouts - which were amazing. But, really? I'd rather leave raving about my main course than my friend's side dish."}
{"text":"Chef power, chef power, and more chef power!  Small plates at the representative value.  A great place to nosh and try things that are prepared with the knowledge of how to use ingredients to make things taste good.  And look good.  Please don't confuse this place with \"Momma's Italian Kitchen\" that leaves you with 2 days worth of meals to go.  You come, you try, and then you pay.  It's about art here, and the art you eat is worth not having to feel like you need a second job to come. Most of us probably eat too much at restaurants in the US anyway.  Many will expand our palettes in a place like this and leave wanting more.  I tried the bone marrow and asparagus recently and they were delicious.  Amazing brussels sprouts and Pea Cavatelli were also tried and enjoyed. The menu changes frequently, so come with open mind and allow your tastes to be expanded."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!! The atmosphere is very chic with neat decorations and details throughout. Between the table We got the pork rinds, eggplant dip, pizza, scallops and the Mac and cheese. Everyone loved what they got!!!! The Brussels are amazing....I would go back just for the side of Brussels. Definitely a must try if your in the area!"}
{"text":"Our first experience with Lolita was on the Friday before Valentine's Day. By the end of the meal, I questioned myself whether I was more in love with the food or my wife! ;)

We started with the Stuffed Hungarian Hots which were intricately stuffed with Pork Sausage. For the main course, I chose the Pork Chops with Spring Vegetables, Bacon and Spinach. I figured I couldn't go wrong with a pork dish as Michael Symon's love for Pork is well documented. My wife ordered the Roasted Chicken with Braised Fennel, Tarragon, Olives and Shallots with a side of Polenta. We shared our meals and decided that both were done perfectly, both in flavor, texture, appearance and temperature. For dessert, we treated ourselves to the Warm Sticky Toffee Pudding and the Chocolate Pot du Creme. Again, our pallets took another trip to Pleasuretown! 

The meals were amazing. Our server was very accommodating and  knowledgeable. The whole experience was reasonably priced too. To recap, we had 4 glasses of wine, 1 app, 2 entrees and 2 desserts, all for under $100?! Bravo Mr. Symon. Bravo!"}
{"text":"My favorite Michael summon joint! This is pretty much Lola but 2/3rds the price for being in Tremont instead of east 4th. 
The duck confit is the best dish I've had in Cleveland, just so good and with some nice original flavors! They had a pork belly appetizer that was also mouth watering, and melt in your mouth delicious. 

The happy hour is a good deal, and the ambiance is great for a happy hour or a hot date later at night. Just an all around great Cleveland spot."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and friendly staff.  The chicken is amazing! It is juicy with a crisp skin and wondrful flavor.  The pork chop is impressive and comes with a variety of fresh vegetable but the chicken is a hands down favorite.

The fried brussel sprouts are also good...they pack a pungent flavor!  A must if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Hey Mike, this place is slipping.

We used to have very engaging servers - ours was surly and curt.

They took the big sample charcuterie board off the menu - they accomodated our special request for a sample platter but that was the best thing on the menu!

It's always been busy and loud, but the music was SO LOUD that our server couldn't even hear what we were ordering - does \"lamb shank\" sound like \"fish\"?

I got the hanger steak, cooked medium-rare.  It came out ice cold in the middle, which is fine but not what I asked for.  Our server stopped by and asked \"how is everything?\" then promptly turned to the next table as I tried to tell her it was not cooked the way I had asked.  I gave up because I don't think cooking it longer would have helped with the taste (or lack thereof).  The steak was served on top of chickpeas, which were so underdone they were actually crunchy.  In case you were wondering, crunchy chickpeas do not taste good.

Others in my party had the sausage/broccoli pizza (good), papardelle (average), and lamb shank (excellent).

I'm disappointed!  Lolita used to be my go-to spot in Cleveland.  Maybe next time we'll try Lola and see if that's any better."}
{"text":"I really had to ponder writing this review because on one hand, I think the food was good, but on the other, after all the hype, I was expecting something more amazing, which really isn't their fault. Summarizing my experience, I'd say about 4.5: great service, bad parking,good food, a little dark, great place to take a date to impress with your willingness to throw down money, and a little more expensive than other places around.

For more detail: 5 stars for the service. I made an online reservation and was pleasantly surprised to get a text message telling me when my table was ready. Then, when I got there, the service was impeccable with the waiter being attentive, but not intrusive. 
The food itself was really good, even if it wasn't the best thing I've ever eaten. I had their seasonal potato soup, which actually was the best I've had in a while. It had these tiny cubes of potato and perfectly crisped bacon... Yum. I'm salivating at the thought of it. Then, the actual meal was not as great, but pretty good. I had the hanger steak, which was odd. Not sure the avocado cubes added anything to the steak, though the pickled onions were delicious. I had the fried Brussels sprouts and was underwhelmed until I got to the bottom of the little jar. I recommend mixing well so you get all the sauce and bits of stuff on top. Then, dessert was fairly good.
I'm pretty sure Yelp is telling me to stop writing at this point, but I do want to point out that this isn't a great place to go on a budget. It cost me about $60 and I only drank water. It's a pretty good restaurant that's probably hurt because it's hard to live up to the hype."}
{"text":"Lolita sits on a quiet neighborhood corner and is a great find.

We pigged out and had more than enough food for two people.  We enjoyed pig tails, chicken livers, brussel sprouts, the Big Board of meats, and a pork sausage pizza.  All delicious!

Service was great, ambiance was great, would go again."}
{"text":"I was not blown away by Lolita, perhaps my expectations where too high. Industrial modern ambiance, that is quite romantic.

Pig ears/tails: not a fan of preparation, very very sugary.

Bone marrow: very tasty, but tiny portion."}
{"text":"So many flavors. So much deliciousness. So much Cleveland love. 
World class dishes all over that menu."}
{"text":"Every dish we ordered was excellent.  Service was ok, nothing amazing but not bad.  Prices extremely fair for the portions, creativity and flavor of food.  Mussels with chorizo are a must order, mushroom pizza very good, roasted chicken cooked perfectly and fried Brussels sprouts are a great side.  Cocktail and wine list great too.  Will be back soon for sure..."}
{"text":"I have waited and wanted to go here for months. And because I have heard so many good things my expectations were very high. I believe they nailed it here. My husband and I planned on going here for the late happy hour on valentines day. Well, the bar area was so packed that we couldn't do that, which was the most disappointing part of the night. 

We sat at a table and ordered some drinks, which by the way the beta is worth driving all that way for by itself it is delicious. We then split the brussel sprouts which I have been dreaming about. I almost thought I knew what they would taste like, but they surprised me. A lot. They were much more vinegary that I thought, but they were just as delicious as what I thought. The walnuts and the vinegar played very nicely together and they were cooked perfectly. Like when I say perfect, they were absolutely cooked perfect and I have no idea how they did that. Next, we split the goat cheese Mac n cheese, and it sounded good but it tasted even better. It was by far the best Mac I have ever had. It was creamy and tangy and just delicious. To end our meal we tried the coffee and chocolate chip gelato. It was the best ice cream I have ever had. It was silky and creamy and a perfect end to the meal. 

The atmosphere was one of more interesting places because the kitchen is open and you can see everything. It was really neat and I really enjoyed it. I would love to come back and try the actual happy hour and maybe a whole dinner here. I think my experience, although was wonderful I didn't get a good grasp on everything."}
{"text":"Kudos to Lolita for happy hour integrity! So many pricey restaurants try to lure customers in with desirable-sounding happy hour food specials that turn out to be really tiny portions - but not Lolita. Their $5 happy hour cocktails are strong, & their $5-$6 happy hour apps are the real deal - straight off the regular menu. & just as big. 

I live right down the street from Lolita but hadn't been yet for a couple reasons: one, it's a little pricier than I'm used to for an average night out, & two, the pork-heavy menu has never really appealed to me. That said, I recently spotted their happy hour menu online & couldn't resist it - $5 fancy cocktails & apps? Yes, please. 

Unfortunately, their in-person happy hour menu was different than what they have listed online, possibly because it changes seasonally & the site hasn't been updated? I was really looking forward to trying the Tremont Smash (spiced rum, apricot brandy, pineapple, passionfruit) &/or the Ranger (watershed gin, blueberry, lemon, soda), but neither was on the actual menu. I went with a bourbon cherry Coke, which turned out to be delicious, if a bit too sweet for my tastes.

We ordered two apps (the same as listed online, to my delight), & as noted, both came in surprisingly huge portions. Very exciting! The mac & cheese was made with chunks of juicy white-meat chicken, creamy goat cheese, & rosemary, just $6, & it was delicious - some zing from the goat cheese, some protein from the chicken. I could've done with more rosemary, but then, I could've eaten a barrel of it, anyway, so I have zero complaints.

We also got their charred eggplant dip, made with feta, lemon, chili, & toasted cumin, & served with housemade flatbread. I'm not a big eggplant person, but mainly because the texture squicks me out a bit. In a form like this, a little bit more like baba ganoush, I'm all in - & this was better than any baba ganoush I've yet had. It does indeed have a charred, smoky flavor, enhanced by the flatbread, which is slightly blackened on the bottom (not burned!) like a good wood-fired oven pizza crust. We devoured this - & when we ran out of flatbread, the bartender offered us a regular (but soft & delicious) bread roll to soak up the last of the dip.

The bartender was friend & polite, attentive but not on top of us, & he was chatty with us & fellow customers at the appropriate times - interesting, informative, talking about the restaurant's famous owner - but not overly chatty in an annoying way. In fact, everyone we interacted with was friendly, pleasant, professional, & not at all uppity in a standard fancy-restaurant way. This is a nice restaurant that treats you like it's not - in a good way. In a Cleveland way.

I don't know if I'll be back to Lolita for regular mealtime - like I said, not a big pork person - but I'll take all the happy hour I can get. This is hands down the best in town!"}
{"text":"Every time I come  to Lolita I continue to have exceptional service and the food is top notch.  The Alaskan halibut is to die for... The eggplant dip... Omg.  It is so delicious.  I am writing another review because not only am I continually impressed by the food but the wait staff is just awesome.  This is a great place to celebrate an accomplishment or to just go out and have a nice dinner.  Five stars for Lolita!"}
{"text":"WOW!  Nice find after another Browns loss.  Beet Salad with whipped ricotta-outstanding.  Gnocchi made by the hands of God-outstanding.  Hanger Steak melting in my mouth-outstanding.  Fried Brussels Sprouts-outstanding.  What's not to like?  Can't wait to go back.  Staff-welcoming and friendly...

Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Our second time around to this little joint. They have some really good Happy Hour specials which are served only at the bar, so if you can grab a seat that's the way to go. 
The menu offers some unconventional items which is refreshing. We started off with the fried bone marrow...absolutely delicious, but I could feel my arteries clogging up as I gobbled it up. We also got to sample the roasted dates ...very good. 
I ended up ordering the mussels for my main course and to be honest, I wasn't overly impressed. The pairing with the sausage wasn't the greatest and I felt like it overwhelmed the flavour of the mussels in wine sauce. 
My husband really enjoyed his duck prosciutto pizza, it was what he ordered last time as well, so it must have been good. hehe. The pizza here is served thin crust, light on the sauce and toppings to offer balance. 
Good meal, but I think that the third time around we're going to aim for the bar to get the happy hour specials!"}
{"text":"Kim's QATTPR (Quick And To The Point Review).
GREAT
Fried Brussels Sprouts with capers and walnuts were absolutely delightful.  So good I was tempted to jump over the bar into the kitchen and kiss whomever it was that made those joyous sprouts from heaven.

MIXED FEELINGS
\"Lolita's choice\" wine was delightful however, please inform me of what it is that I will be consuming instead of simply alabama slammin it on the bar in front of me and walking away. 

BAD TO THE BONE
Chickpea Dip with scallions and cumin however, the description failed to include the 25 TABLESPOONS OF LEMON JUICE that was added which was so overwhelming I assume someone was playing a joke on me. ... \"I wonder if this blonde girl figures out that she's eating a Mr.Clean inspired recipe?\"

peace, blessing, salad dressing

{"text":"my wifes and i favorite dinner spot in cleveland and one of my favorite anywhere....  we come at least twice a month..  if you ever come to cleveland it is a must stop.."}
{"text":"This restaurant is our go-to spot to take applicants who are visiting Cleveland for the first time.  I mean, it's always fun to brag about Cleveland's own iron chef, and the food at Lolita is definitely worthy of bragging.  It's more down to earth and hearty while Lola's food is more upscale and classy.  To me, this also means that Lolita is cheaper and tastier.  Their menu changes pretty frequently, but I have had pork chop, quail, duck, the pasta and many a seafood of the day here and they all taste pretty good.

Lolita loses a star for its service though.  It seems that their waitstaff is chronically sluggish, and dinner sometimes takes upwards of 2.5 or 3 hours.  Also, one time we ordered a bruschetta appetizer for the table (which, by the way, tastes fabulous), and we finished all but one, which we left on the plate.  After an hour of waiting for our main courses, we prodded our waiter, who replied that he had not put in the orders for our main courses yet because we hadn't finished our appetizer.  Really?  A single piece of bread has been sitting in the middle of our table for an hour and you don't even care to ask if we were done?"}
{"text":"As if Lolita needed another five star review.

This restaurant has the best food, the sexiest atmosphere, and the most delicious martinis around. My personal favorites are the bone marrow and the duck confit, but everything is just perfect. Boar ragu, crispy pizzas, excellent cheese plates... yeah, this is the best."}
{"text":"Delicious as always. Really cannot say a bad thing about this place. Just want to say we were thankful for the polite staff and timely service given the disaster that made us leave another restaurant in Tremont. 
This time I had the mortadella pizza - which I would get without the green olives next time. (I've previously had the pig roast special - on Tuesdays - the brussel sprouts, polenta, bucatini, etc.)"}
{"text":"Lolita's tucked away in a real quiet area of Cleveland but the first thing I noticed when I set foot in was the comforting ambiance.  There were plush benches with pillows and just the overall atmosphere made for an intimate setting.  I was impressed with the service but we were also only one of 3 tables during happy hour which was surprising.  I started w/ the beta drink which was a vodka infused w/ ginger which tasted really clean and went down easy.  However, happy hour food specials were very mediocre.  The best of the 5 was the mac & cheese w/ chicken which alone, I would've given 4 stars to.  But the others fell short of expectations: the burger had a great concept (served w/ bacon, a fried egg, aged cheddar, and onions over an english muffin) but the meat was really uneven and extremely dry in spots.  One bite would be \"hmm good, cheddar really kicked in and the onions provide some juice.\"  But others left me wondering if this was the driest burger I've ever eaten - not a good sign.  The brussel sprouts were surprisingly tasty - fried and served w/ anchovies.  The mussels were very boring and the ricotta dip was a challenge to finish b/c it was so tasteless.  I wanted to like Iron Chef Michael Symon's place but it just did not live up to expectations.  Maybe it was because he was on his book signing and the kitchen lacked his talent.  Nevertheless, we had a good time and it's a serviceable happy hour spot especially since it seems that not many ppl go during that time."}
{"text":"Believe the Hype!

My friend and I went to Lolita's for dinner in the late evening on Friday. We'd made reservations the day before and had no problem, however, on our way out, there was a small crowd of people waiting outside, so I would recommend making a reservation. 

We were seated immediately and decided to start with mussels and shrimp. The shrimp were definitely a 5/5. Shrimp arent very hard to cook, yet still so many places manage to overcook them. These shrimp were not only fresh (clearly had not been prefrozen), but were taken off the heat about a minute before they were fully cooked, that way by the time they arrived at our table, they were perfect! A little crunch, which we loved, and the sauce was de.li.cious. What impressed us most was that the flavors complemented, not overpowered the shrimp, so you could actually taste shrimp. Definitely recommended. The mussels were probably a 3.5/5. Nothing wrong with them, but nothing spectacular. We liked that it was served with sausage.

About 10 minutes after we finished our appetizers, dinner arrived! Wow. Just wow. I had the lamb and my friend had the chicken. Lamb and chicken are things you could find at nearly every restaurant, but theres a certain comfort in having basic foods cooked exceedingly well. The lamb was well portioned and oh so tender (i like medium-well). The heirloom tomatoes, mint, and olives were a great touch as well. But the chicken was the real star. Perfectly cooked. The skin was nice and crispy, and gave that mouthwatering crunch when you sliced into it. Inside, the chicken was soooo moist and tender and every bite was well seasoned. TRULY a pleasure . 

Overall, it was a great experience and I will definitely return. I would have given it 5 stars, but I'm taking a star away for service. The waiter forgot our bread, and we had to ask another waiter for it. Though our glasses were kept full throughout the meal, there was a full 15 minutes between the time our dinner plates were removed and the time we got the dessert menu (???). There was also an additional wait for the check. It wasn't the most horrible service we've ever had, but we would've expected better."}
{"text":"My husband and I are from the San Francisco Bay Area and were in Cleveland last weekend to visit the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and eat at Lola's, which was fantastic.  We're foodies.  My husband is a cook.  We were so inspired by Lola's that we had dinner at Lolita's the next night.  It was a mixed experience.  The place is charming as can be.  We didn't care for the ambiance and decor of Lola (we didn't get the interior design concept and the place is cavernous and loud- our only complaint).  Lolita is cozy and inviting and appointed beautifully.  The price point is very wallet friendly.  Like Lola, a somewhat limited menu, but not a problem.  The first off-putting moment occurred immediately.  We brought a nice bottle of Rosso di Montalcino to have with our meal.  I put the bottle on the table and the waiter came by and asked if we'd like to order wine.  I pointed out that we brought a bottle, which was right in front of him, to which he replied that he couldn't open our wine.  My husband asked why and he said that they don't do that.  We frequently bring wine with us when we eat out.   It's a foodie privilege.  It wasn't the fact that we couldn't do it here- it was the waiter's attitude.  I can handle anything, even a so-so dinner, as long as I'm not treated like a child or moron.  The waiter could have explained Lolita's policy on outside wine / corkage a whole other way and he could have bee a lot cooler about it, as opposed to snitty and effete.  I ordered a class of the alberino (very nice at $8 / glass) we shared a wild mushroom pizza with arugula, which was very good- more like flat bread, which I like.  So, it was good, but the earth didn't move or anything.  We shared roasted shrimp with tomatoes and feta, which was excellent.  The shrimp were fresh and seasoned perfectly.  My husband ordered lamb kfedetas (sp?) and chicken livers.  He liked the livers but the lamb balls were overdone.  Our snitty waiter took them off the bill, so that was great.  We didn't have dessert.  In short, a bit of a disappointment after stellar food and service at Lola.  The ambiance was great.  Warm, cozy, romantic.  Food was good and reasonable.  Our bill only came to around $50.  If I were in Cleveland again I would be open to trying again."}
{"text":"Lucky me, I got two birthday dinners in one week!  I came here on my actual birthday, a Friday night at 8 pm.  We had a reservation for 10 people (lots of family and friends!) and we were seated immediately at a very long table, perfect for the purpose.  The restaurant was pretty boisterous and noisy, but honestly it wasn't too bad.  Sure, we all had to talk at a slightly louder volume, but it was a party atmosphere!  Nobody had to scream to be heard.

Servers were friendly and largely pretty fast - impressive, given how many of us were at the table!  I started with a birthday girl cocktail - the Gin Blossom - which is funny because I had a cocktail in Pittsburgh called the Gin Blossom literally the day before.  The Gin Blossom at Lolita was, essentially, a martini glass of gin.  With some lemony fruit flavor.  But mostly gin.  Dear lord, it was boozy.  It took me the whole meal to finish it, and I got pretty darn tipsy!  I heard from my boyfriend's mom that their cocktails are pretty killer, so be warned - only drink one if you want to be able to remember the meal.  yeehaw!

We got two pizzas for the table to share as appetizers - the tomato pizza (basic Margherita style, i think) and the pork sausage pizza (a little spicy!)  I only tried the sausage one, but it was delish.  Great crispy crust!  Now that I'm thinking about it, I forgot who took home the extra pieces of pizza...damn you Gin Blossom!  I wish I had leftover pizza today.

My boyfriend and I also got the roasted bone marrow - because how often do you get to eat THAT!  And yes, it is served, in a bone.  Because that's where it comes from.  They don't put it in a bowl or anything, so if you don't want a big cow bone on your plate, be aware of that.  It came with grilled bread, and a light, herbal condiment.  I don't even know how to describe it....it was very rich in texture.  I have to confess, I didn't get a ton of flavor out of it?  My boyfriend's mom loved it (grew up eating it), but it didn't do much for me.  It wasn't bad, just sort of...nondescript.  Sticky.  Thick.  Spreadable.  Meaty-ish.  I tried it once, I got the foodie cred, now I think I wouldn't hurry to order it again.  But I mean, I was also halfway into a Gin Blossom at this point, so if you think you'd love bone marrow, go ahead and order it!

My entree was the bucatini with pulled pork, pancetta, egg yolk, and pecorino - and it was deliiiiiiiicious!  The pulled pork was so tender, so juicy, so flavorful, so smoky and oddly so perfect with noodles!  The portion was large, and the meal was rich, so I couldn't finish it, but it was definitely crave-worthy.  I loved reheating some for lunch the next day.

Also - the prices are pretty fantastic here!  $15-17 for amazing pastas, $17-22 for entrees - I've paid so much more than that for meals of equal or worse quality.  OH and did I mention the brussels sprouts?!  I forgot about them.  They are fried, and served in a cute little bowl with walnuts.  They are tangy and delicious from anchovies and capers, and would turn anybody into a brussels sprouts fan .

We brought our own dessert (birthday caaaaaaake!) and they provided the candles.  Everyone seemed to really enjoy their dinner, marveling at the low prices and high quality.  I would absolutely come back.....if I lived in Cleveland, that is... drat!  You will all have to go and enjoy it for me, since I probably won't have many opportunities to come back.  But Lolita definitely has great stuff to offer!  (including valet parking for only $5!  ballerrrrrrr)."}
{"text":"Good Lord, this place is the absolute best.  Between the food and service, it doesn't get any better.  Yes, you're going to wait for a table.  Yes, you're going to have to either do valet parking or plan on walking a little way, but it's absolutely worth every roadblock.  Don't hesitate, just go."}
{"text":"The highlight of our over night visit to Cleveland (other than the Sox beating the Indians) was eating at Lolita.  I am a HUGE fan of Iron Chef Mike Symon's so couldn't visit his hometown without trying one of his restaurants. Chose Lolita as I liked the menu more than Lola. Dined with Husband and son and all 3 loved the meal, start to finish.  No wait on a Friday at 6 pm and we were seated right away. Started with a variety of apps. My hands down favorite was the roasted dates with bacon, DH loved the fried chicken livers on a bed of polenta and DS had mussels with chorizo and we all tried the roasted bone marrow (ok but not as great as it is described by some). Service was very friendly and attentive throughout the meal. I liked that courses weren't rushed out. Entrees were excellent also. Buccatini with pulled pork, pork chop perfectly cooked and the special - a moist mahi mahi. Had to try the Brussels sprouts and they were decidedly not the brussels sprouts of my youth. Crispy, caramelized goodness, oh my!! We ended with two sublime desserts - order them even if you are full! The dense, dark chocolate pot de creme was a nice balance to the refreshing coconut sorbet. Only thing that could have improved the visit was meeting Mike Symon's himself but we were thoroughly pleased with the experience nonetheless."}
{"text":"Perhaps the best food I've had in the area. The cured meats can't be found else where, and the flavors and mixes are astounding. The service was impeccable, and the ambiance was great as well."}
{"text":"This was my second stop of the day in my tour of Michael Symon's Cleveland restaurants.  I can't say that I was disappointed.  The location was a bit off the beaten path for a tourist like myself, and street parking was at a premium.  I was pleasantly surprised when I stepped inside at how trendy and upscale the interior was and we were promptly seated as I had called ahead to make a reservation.

This is not a restaurant you want to go to if time is precious to you.  Our 3-course meal took about 2 hours and we were there on a not so busy Wednesday night.  The bone marrow appetizer was something I had heard was a must try and everyone was right in saying it was something different but delicious.  Everything on the menu was eclectic and seemed to look good.  I was not disappointed in my meal, and dessert was definitely something to look forward to.  I had the pumpkin pound cake which was served with a cream cheese frosting ice cream and caramel drizzle.  I knew I was in heaven when it arrived.  

Overall, I was very satisfied with my experience here.  The prices were very reasonable for a restaurant of this magnitude.  I will come back for sure the next time I am in the area."}
{"text":"Some disclaimers:  I am not a food tourist. I like Michael Symon, but I don't think he can do no wrong. I think, for example, that B Spot is pretty mediocre. All that said, Lolita is my favorite Symon restaurant, and the nerdy food tourists that come wandering in are lucky. Clevelanders are wont to sneer at popular things, but this place has been around for a long time with good reason. This place would be worthy of five stars for its absurdly inexpensive happy hour alone. For $5, you get some of the best choices on the restaurant's menu and $4 wine or $2 beer. You can overeat and be well lubricated for less than $20 here. If you want a more varied menu, the rest isn't too expensive either. The only flaw about this place is its popularity, which is hardly a cardinal sin."}
{"text":"Restaurant was great. Good late night happy hr on food and the staff here was really friendly and helpful to an out of towner"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here and really thought the place was very charming.  The main reason that I am giving this only 4 stars is because my wife is not very adventurous and didn't care for much of the food that she tried.  I, however, really enjoyed everything that I tried.  Being from the south originally you don't see a lot of chicken livers on menus in the north and they were done perfectly, which is a lot of work to clean.  The hangar steak was cooked properly and pizza that we had (wife thought was spicy) was very good in my opinion.

The server was good at her job, but was kind of going through the motions.  Not ready to write her off as she was good and we all have our moments.  

All-in-all, I would give this 5 stars, but my wife would give it 3...I'm learning to compromise, so 4 stars it is."}
{"text":"HAPPY HOUR REVIEW:

When I'm in Cleveland this is definitely at the top of my list of stops. Even though Michael Symon succumbed to celebrity chefdom, his restaurants are still 100% the bomb! Lolita (former house of Lola) is conveniently located in the revamped, cool Tremont area. Makes it a great place to stop for HH, have a drink, and some food in preparation tor barhopping in Tremont. 

$5 food and drinks during HH at the bar. A few great cocktails to choose from, but I usually opt for the \"choice\" beer. Garlicy mussels cooked to perfection; try the fried brussel sprouts and you'll quickly decide all of those other guys have been doing it way wrong; and the 5 buck Lolita burger with that creamy, oozy fried egg on top is by far the best deal in town! Another great app to try is the Bone Marrow ($10). If you've never indulged in the fatty lushness that is marrow before, this is the place to try it because nobody knows fat, and loves it, as much as Chef Symon! Hats off to you sir!

Bonus: HH's available Tuesday through Sunday!!! Hours vary."}
{"text":"Our conversation walking back to the car from our meal at Lolita:

\"I have to say, that was the best roast chicken I've ever had.\"
\"Well, I have to say, those were the best sea scallops I've ever had.\"

The roast chicken was juicy, flavorful, with a nice even crisp crust on the outside.  Actually, I can say the same for the scallops.  I'm not sure what sauce they used with the scallops, but it was wonderfully matched with the seafood.  Service was great.  Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu and about the ingredients in the food in general.  Portions and prices aren't too bad either.  You'll leave pleasantly full."}
{"text":"Awesome dinner! You have to try the big plate with all of the cured meats, pickled fennel and fruit. This is the beat prosciutto I have had and the cure duck breast starts off sweet and has a great salty, savory flavor! The pork sausage and braised beef cheek pepperadelli were bursting with flavor and as always, the beef cheek was exremely tender. You also can't leave there without having the Brussels sprouts.  We also had an Erique Foster Mablec, Ique and it was a nice smooth, fruity wine that went well with everything we ate."}
{"text":"Brussels sprouts = awesome.

Pork = awesome.

Wine = awesome

Atmosphere = awesome

I don't remember not liking anything about it.... Will be returning"}
{"text":"I finally made it to happy hour, and if its possible, I was even more blown away.  

I tried the burger, brussel sprouts, and mussels - all for $5 each by the way.  This is the best way i can put it.  I need to take an advanced writing class to get the language and verbiage to accurately convey how good each of these were, because I currently do not have what it takes.  So good.  The burger is unique, made simply still with a english muffin, pickled onions and a fried egg.  The mussels were plentiful; shocking actually for a mere $5.  The broth that it came in was oozing with rich flavor - at one point I was actually dipping my burger in it - it nearly crippled me with happiness.  Lastly, the brussel sprouts...I know these have been reviewed to death, but they truly are the best. Hands down.  

I'd like to add to the \"Beta\" cocktail at happy hour is pretty delicious as well, and pairs nicely with the happy hour cuisine.  I also got a gin martini, and it was pretty special too.  The bartenders are top notch here.  

I have never said this before, mainly because I have not felt strongly enough for any meal or experience, but Lolita is the best restaurant I have ever been to."}
{"text":"Went on a Thursday night March 7, party of four. Sat in the front left corner in front of the window.  Music was way too loud; we couldn't hear ourselves talk. I was psychotic from the noise by the time I left.
As far as the food goes, the charcuterie, pizza, and fried chicken livers were divine but the brussel sprouts were covered in too much oil and vinegar and the potato gratin was dry and unseasoned.  
The waiter seemed confused as to why we were there.  I kind of wanted to giggle and say \"hmmm we are here for dinner, we need drinks, menus, service, come back and check on us to make sure the food is okay\". 
And, please tell the people who order the appetizer of olives that it  is huge and meant for a group, my poor friend kind of looked lost.  I felt guilty cause I was not sharing my chicken livers with her. yes, I was selfish but the boys had ordered the Big Board charcuterie.
Go to Lola's."}
{"text":"When I argue food with friends who hail from different parts of the US, my argument inevitably leads me to Michael Symon's places, including Lolita.

I'm happy to compare the food and experience of eating at Lolita to the restaurants of NY, Nola, Bsoton, DC, etc. The food here is incredible, and is served bistro style without the airs of \"fine dining\". It's a cool, dimly lit spot that never seems overly crowded (except during happy hour) and is easy to get a reservation at.

Food here is locally sourced and expertly prepared. The brussel sprouts are roasted in a rich sauce (I wont spoil the ingredients) and the mac n cheese sides are homestyle and rich. Pasta dishes are typically sourced from local vendors (Little italy) and have exceptional sauces. The pizza is wood fired and prepared neapolitan style, and the burgers......sweet mother of mercy, the burgers here are awe inspiring. Lolita uses the best meat and dresses it up with fried eggs, pickled onions, etc. 5$ for one of those bad boys, if you're there at the right time.

The servers are friendly (except for one, you'll know her when you see her) and the atmosphere is romantic and inspires close conversation and mellow vibes. 

I send everyone who is in town for just one meal here, and i'm going to pick up the cookbook for the food at some point and get used to making it at home; it's a stop that can NOT be missed on any trip to Tremont."}
{"text":"One of the loveliest restaurants I've ever visited. The women's bathroom alone was worth a visit.

The pizza was good but not mindblowing. The beet and ricotta appetizer was yummy and surprisingly large.  Great tea selection.

Delightful spot."}
{"text":"Fried brussell sprouts.  even my teenager eats them.  Had a wonderful steak and great freshly grilled pizza. Love this place."}
{"text":"A group of seven dined for a girl's night out. The portions were very generous and the food was very good. The brussel sprouts were the best I've ever tasted. The vegetarian options that didn't include starch was limited. This is not a calorie conscience menu so plan to splurge if you go here. The service was excellent. We especially appreciated them splitting the check for us; that was an unexpected bonus. The only comment I could make is that we were annoyed to have to navigate by smokers both coming in and exiting the restaurant. Overall a fun night out!"}
{"text":"I ordered some things that were a little out of my comfort zone, so some things I liked and some things I didn't. I knew I was running that risk when I ordered them. Overall the food tasted fantastic. My biggest issue was the roasted dates, and that was with the texture of the dates. The flavor was great, but the texture was off-putting. I'd never had dates before, and now I know that I'm not a fan. I had the hanger steak, which was also something different with me. I figured that I could order steak there and decide whether my previous experiences with steak were disappointing just because it was bad steak, or if I truly did not like steak. Again the flavors were fantastic, but I'm not a fan of chewing my meat forever, which seems to be a requirement with steak. I chose the polenta as my side dish and was very impressed. We ended our meal with a slice of pumpkin bread. It is a very small portion for $8, and at first I was a little upset that we were getting so little for our money. Then I had a bite of it, and it was perfect. It tasted spectacular and was just the right amount to end the meal with.

The only complaint I have is that the restaurant was too dark. It might have been a good thing because I'm pretty sure that my \"medium\" steak would have been rare anywhere else. I was happier not knowing just how red it was."}
{"text":"Had the crispy pig ears and tails, hanger steak, and dessert.  The brussel sprouts could have been cooked better.  Overall the food was very good, but I expected just a touch better."}
{"text":"I love this place! If you didn't already know, Lolita is the little sister of Lola, Chef Michael Simon's pride and joy.

Lolita's atmosphere is fantastic. The decor is inviting and a little playfully sultry. But, you can't eat the atmosphere.

The food is just great! I will admit to having enjoyed many many more happy hours than dinners but I stand by my description. Whether Michael Simon is there or not, the kitchen pumps out dish after dish of deliciousness.

Speaking of happy hour - want to impress someone and not have to refinance the mortgage? You need to check out Lolita. Just about the best happy hour at any price (and theirs is amazingly affordable).

5 Stars? Duh!"}
{"text":"I'm writing an update about a week after writing my first review, that's how incredible Lolita is. I just had to return for dinner and I am so glad that I did! New favorites include:

- Crispy pig tails and ears: How does one make such disgusting body parts taste so heavenly? These are crunchy, saucy, and so savory. They resemble orange chicken but seriously kick butt in an way that orange chicken never could
- Roasted bone marrow: This is a meal in it's own right. You sly dog Micheal Symon for making this an appetizer. While I personally felt it was a little too fatty (almost created a film on my upper palate and teeth), the salsa verde and scallions on top were YUMSICLE. Just make sure you balance each bite of marrow with ample veggies, or you'll drown in fatty goodness and fall asleep before you make it to the entrees! 
- Grilled quail: How can such a ridiculously tiny animal provide so much delicious sustenance?? The meat almost falls off the bone and is delectably rich. The yogurt sauce underneath is almost too good (has a very Indian-esque flavoring)...I don't think I blinked once while I inhaled that bird

Best part of the entire meal was that I had leftovers that were still amazing the next day :)"}
{"text":"Color me impressed....and, 12 hours later, still full. 

I'm no expert on Cleveland dining (being from Chicago and all), so of course I deferred to my blonde OH counterparts for the dinner suggestion. And suggest they did...a moderately priced American restaurant coined Lolita, and on Literary Avenue no less....let's go!

WINNER WINNER (hangar steak/porkchop/chicken/brussel sprout/polenta/bone marrow/arugula salad) DINNER! 

A bottle of the \"Twelve Clones\" pinot noir: under $40. Very reasonable, and nary a drop to be found between the three of us. The wine list is quite extensive, and has a nice selection of bubbles as well. The cocktail list tempting, but maybe for another time. 

Starter: The bone marrow (\"like butter\") was exceptional. Arugula salad with goat cheese and string onions was simple, but fresh, light and demolished swiftly. 

My pork chop was cooked beautifully, presented with greens atop and served over that to-moan-over polenta. Even with an extra side of it, our table couldn't seem to contain themselves. I had bites of both the hangar steak (mouth melty) and the chicken (massive portion), and everything was simply wonderful. 

Service was on-point and friendly. Ambience was upscale, but accessible. 

I can't speak to the happy hour, but from what I read/hear...it's quite attractive, and also...quite restrictive in where you can sit, etc. I always find that situation to be a little....err...awkward, truthfully. All or nothing keeps the crowds happy and reaches the common goal: people in seats, happy people in seats. People getting what they came for. 

And I think everyone is coming for a little bite (ok, a lot of little bites) of Michael Symon. Well done, sir!

Total"}
{"text":"First time here, I was a little hesitant because I'd been disappointed by Lola, but the friend I was dining with wanted to try a Michael Symon restaurant. The interior had dim lighting and dark wood but remained inviting and intimate. Service was surprisingly prompt, given the other reviews. We started with venison carpaccio, which was delicate and delicious. The citrus and pomegranate seeds were a perfect complement. My hanger steak was perfectly cooked and incredibly delicate, and the Gorgonzola fondue added the perfect touch of salt and creamy, earthy flavor without being overwhelming.  This was one of the best steaks I've had in awhile!  Lolita's reputation is well deserved, and I can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Lolita is one of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland. But the last time I was there, I felt it slipped from a 5 star worthy review.   Located in Tremont, it has a great vibe, excellent for small groups. There's bar seating, right by the kitchen. Also discovered this weekend, it has a patio hidden away in the back.  Having been here in the winters, guess patio never factored in.  

Drinks: An excellent selection of cocktails, beer and wine. I recently tried Beta (vodka, ginger, lime), was nice but not the best combination of the above I have ever had. 

Appetizers: I fall for the charred egg plant dip, which is simply phenomenal. Others I like are Beef Tartar, Mussels (highly recommended) and bone marrow. 

Entrees: They have a unique selection of pizza's which gives a twist to the whole menu. Risotto w rabbit was good but not out of this world. 

Of note, there is not much in terms for vegans/vegetarians, but the chef is happy to make a house dish if needed. But then this is a carnivore heaven."}
{"text":"Goat cheese macaroni and cheese with chicken-snooth and tastee.  Chocolate desert is awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Ate at Lolita for the 2nd time last night. Overall the food and atmosphere is good, although here are a few details. I ordered the market fish. It was well cooked- flaky and moist, except for the bottom which was chewy and rubbery...not sure why. It seemed a little undercooked. For sides we ordered the Romano beans- nothing exciting. (They are green beans in a tomato sauce with some fatty pieces of bacon.) and the fried brussels sprouts. These are great, but WAY too oily. Next time I am going to truly ask if they can go light on the oil. Other than that, the host actually offered us a table this time, as opposed to all of the other times we stopped in without reservations we have only been offered the bar...even if our table was right by the air conditioner and the server offered us a pillow to cover the vent...as if she has seen the problem before.  I am not a promoter of this place yet, but I will go back and try it again."}
{"text":"Had dinner there last night and, once again, Lolita shows they set the bar for the highest quality food, drink and service.  And they do it while keeping prices within reason--and, that, my foodie friends, ain't easy. 

If I had to guess, I'd say my wife and I have eaten there at least a couple of dozen times, and not ONCE were we ever disappointed. And if we ever were, I don't doubt for one minute they'd make things right in a nanosecond. 

Just go. Go. GO!

Oh, P.S. to \"Angry B\" With all due respect, your review gets no respect."}
{"text":"I've been to Roast in Detroit a couple times, so when I visited Cleveland I wanted to make sure to visit one of the other Symon restaurants.  Unfortunately I don't really have a whole lot to say about the food that hasn't been said before so this will mostly be a comparison between the two places.

I really like the rustic atmosphere and decor of Lolita, and prefer it over Roast, which caters to the \"place to be seen\" sorta crowd.   The menu is smaller at Lolita, and less expensive.  I think the food is definitely more \"perfect\" from a presentation standpoint at Roast, but i'm pretty sure the tiny kitchen at Lolita and some other factors account for that.  

The food was still great, and there are some great values (for 4.00, the warm olives appetizer is much larger and tastier than you'd expect, and the chicken entree is pretty huge).  Sides were a little small though, whereas the sides at Roast each will feed like 3 people.  

Ultimately, i definitely prefer the casual atmosphere, outdoor seating, and rustic feel of Lolita, even with the smaller menu.  I would definitely go back if I'm ever in town again."}
{"text":"Second time here, just as satisfying. Great cocktails to warm up. Peach bellini and Infused rye, chartreuse and basil cocktail of some sort.
 
Shared a bunch of dishes. Warm olives, pig tails and ears, figs, and the big charcuterie board. All were creative and well executed. The Big Charcuterie Board was our favorite, with about eight different house made charcuteries (save one that was not house made)."}
{"text":"Had dinner there, a friend and I split the mac and cheese, and a pizza.  We also had the roasted dates for an appetizer.  Amazing food!.  Drank some wonderful wine.  Great service, very cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"LOVE Lolita. Excellent food and a great late night happy hour. Excellent chorizo mussels. Friendly/great service. The restaurant also has a very well done interior.

Would def recommend for dinner or for happy hour.  Also try the Brussels sprouts."}
{"text":"Food? Excellent. Service? So terrible that this review lost three golden stars.

The good: Excellent food, we ordered a bunch of small plates so I got to try everything. Charred eggplant dip was very yummy. Not that many vegetarian options, but it's Michael Symon so that was expected. 

The bad: I'm pretty sure our waitress was high. While the rest of our table was deciding what to order, my friend knew she wanted to order one appetizer right away. She tells the waitress, who refused to put in my friend's order until everyone at the had decided what they wanted so everything could be ordered at once. Um, excuse me? This has never, in the history of restaurants, happened to me or anyone I know.
We place our orders but I tell her I want to keep my menu in case I want something else. She takes it away. Same thing happened to my friend across the table.
She comes with my friend's appetizer, and my friend doesn't notice that the waitress arrived so she doesn't make room on the table for the appetizer. I nudge my friend and the waitress yells at her to \"focus.\" Umm..what? My friend didn't see the waitress; she did nothing wrong. Why yell at her? 
It was so, so bizarre.

The ugly: No tip for the waitress, probably not going to waste my time here again. Get off your high horse, Michael Symon, and try to improve your \"award winning\" restaurants."}
{"text":"LOVE Lolita!  Sitting at the bar for happy hour is the best!  Chicken and rosemary goat cheese mac and cheese is AWESOME! I used to hate brussles sprouts until i tried their fried brussels sprouts and WOW they are DELICIOUS!  The hamburgers are GREAT, second only to the burgers at Tremont Tap House!"}
{"text":"Lolita is great, but a bit small so hard to get a table. Lines form so get there early! 

We started with dates that were so delicious and amazing. I ordered the gnocchi and it was really good, but the portion wasn't too big. I left a little hungry. My hubby ordered the macaroni with chicken and goat cheese and thought it was heavenly."}
{"text":"On this trip to Cleveland, I had a coworker with me and told him he had to try Lolita because the experience last time was perfect.
We don't have a lot of restaurants in neighborhoods like Tremont in Raleigh and Lolita's casual upscale atmosphere makes it a not too formal treat.
We both tried pork dishes - it seems wrong not to have pork when in Cleveland considering how much Michael Symon loves it.  I had the pork special which was shredded pork over polenta topped with spicy peppers and arugula.  My coworker had the pork chop dish on the menu.  Both dishes were excellent.
We went with wine over beer because they do not have beer on draft - there's a large bottled beer selection but it would be nice if there were beers on draft.
The only other thing I noticed and didn't like this time around is how dark it is.  I could hardly see my food - the dimmed amber lighting is nice but it should be bright enough so I can see and fully appreciate the presentation."}
{"text":"Dinner at Lolita's last evening with my son and 5 co workers and the atmosphere was very nice. Love the tin paneled ceiling, and the soft lighting. Also they are considerate of their customers by covering their entrance to prevent Ice on the step. We had an array of appetizers and they were all good. The stuffed peppers were excellent, the olives were great, also there was brochette, stuffed dates, and mussels which were very tasty. I had the Lamb shank, son had the gnocchi. Both were excellent and the Brussels sprouts fried were very good. My only negative, which is my negative with all restaurants is WAY too much salt. I judge this by the fact that I want to submerge my face into a barrel of cool spring water the morning after. All said, GO there, it's a great place (next time I will ask them to hold the salt) :) TIP MAKE A RESERVATION AND BE ON TIME!"}
{"text":"We had a fabulous dinner here with out of towners from Boston. Every dish on our table was outstanding, including the linguini, marrow appetizer, spicy fish appetizer and risotto. Our Boston family was impressed and that was impressive considering Boston's restaurant scene. On a Wednesday night it was packed but the service was impeccable. What a gem!!"}
{"text":"I went to Lolita last night with a few friends and loved every minute of our dinner there! The staff and service were great and very helpful in regards to questions about the menu. I ended up ordering the asparagus pizza (with prosciutto and chili)  with a side of soft polenta. The polenta was to die for! I also tried some of the fried brussels sprouts, which were also extremely delicious. Everything was just amazing and I'm so happy that I got to experience Michael Symon's cuisine!"}
{"text":"Oh, Lolita. True to name, you're like a guilty indulgence that I want more of.

While visiting Cleveland, I went to Lolita for a late dinner around 9:20pm on a Thursday. I sat at the bar, and there was quite a full crowd because they have a second, late happy hour from 9pm-10pm with great deals on drinks and small plates.

I ordered the house red wine ($4 at happy hour!), and two suggestions of the bartender: the roasted dates to start and the steak entree with a side of brussels sprouts. The dates ($7) were incredibly decadent: roasted and topped with almonds, bacon, chilies and parsley, they are a party in your both of sweet and salty and spicy. The sirloin ($20), which the bartender told me is a new menu item, was beautifully cooked and topped with parmesan, truffle butter, arugula and mushrooms. It was good, although there are other things on the menu that might be more exciting. The STAND OUT dish of the evening was the fried brussels sprouts, which I would very much like the recipe for so I can gorge myself on them every night. Those babies, topped with crispy crumbled bits of anchovy, capers and walnuts, were pure bliss. And let's be honest, how often do you really have the opportunity to call brussles sprouts blissful? Probably not very often. 

I capped off the evening with a glass of Oban scotch, neat. Perfection."}
{"text":"**3.5 stars** 
I had high expectations for Lolita based on what I heard and read but was a little disappointed.  I came here recently for dinner when I visited some relatives in Cleveland. We had a large party of 9 people and the restaurant was accomodating.  We were able to get a reservation a day before our dinner.  

When we arrived to the restaurant we were seated right away. The interior of the restaurant is really cool...props to the designer.  We started dinner by ordering a number of appetizers and they were brought out right away.  The standouts for me were the chicken wings, chicken livers and mussels. However, our entrees took forever to come. I saw other parties that had come in after we did get their food before we did. And, I'm not sure if it had to do with our large party or not.  After waiting so long we finally had to ask our waitress what was taking so long and soon after our entrees came.  I had opted for the simple Roasted chicken.  My chicken was a little overcooked but tasty. I didn't really care for the sundried tomato salsa that it was served with.  Some of my relatives were disappointed with their entrees. Some of the pasta dishes were a little too dry.  Because we were disappointed with our meals and the service we decided not to order dessert and cut our losses."}
{"text":"It's a great little space and when searching for more info on the resto I found 'happy hour' kept coming up. It's the real deal. You have a choice of entrees for $5 with wine and cocktail specials from $4-$5 as well. I had the 1/2 mac and cheese with goat cheese, chicken and rosemary, and also ordered the Lolita burger once I saw a neighbor digging into it. Both dishes were amazing. The lolita burger was one of the best I'd ever had. Get there right at 5 since the bar fills up quickly and the specials are only available at the bar. It's too bad I live in Atlanta now as I'd definitely be a regular if I was still there."}
{"text":"Had to drag a coworker to Lolita's. It's difficult when you're with someone that doesn't like to try anything new. There is pizza though bMy advice is enjoy the appetizers that you can't get anywhere else. The Mac was wonderfully creamy. And appreciate that Michael Simon owns this wonderful establishment."}
{"text":"Warning: NON PICKY EATER WITH HIGH EXPECTATIONS REVIEW COMING RIGHT ALONG....Visiting Cleveland for the first time, a few friends and I wanted to experience one of Michael Symon's famous restaurants. Lola's was a bit pricey for our taste, so we chose Lolitas as they seemed to have good options, for a much lower price tag. The ambiance was fantastic, no denying this. He(or his planners) have good decorating skills. It feels warm n cozy, and happy and intimate... Now, onto the food...On the appetizers, we ordered the Spring Salad, Crispy Pig Tails and Ears, and Roasted Bone Marrow. The spring salad was delicious, light with just enough kick. The combination of ingredients was perfect. But simply, it's a spring salad...The Crispy pig tails and ears, appears just like a chicken wing drumstick portion. It's a darker meat, with lots n lots of fat on it. Think Pork wings. If you like very fatty foods, this is a great choice....The dressing/or batter could have had more of a kick to it, to maybe subdue the strong taste of the pork, but overall, it was OK. The Bone Marrow was my favorite app, however it was still very very greasy. The sliced bread they serve it with was also drenched in oil. It just seemed like all of the dishes just had an overload of oil added to them. Now, onto the entrees. Firstly, the entrees are not very large! One friend ordered the Halibut special, very very small portion, but the fish itself was fresh, and had a good simple base. Another friend ordered the mushroom pizza. Nothing to rave about, simple, but again with the OIL! Standard personal pizza size, Just so greasy!! I ordered the pappardelle pasta. It was a very small portion, and the sauce was super heavy and creamy. It was good, don't get me wrong. All of the dishes were simply just that, \"OK\"...It wasn't the kind of meal that you savored each bite, and made noises every time you tasted something different. Which, I expected out of a top chef restaurant. Maybe i'm just used to the NYC way of restaurants. Maybe we lose things in transition once restaurants become too commercialized. I think that's what happened here. The fame takes precedence and the quality of food and recipes lacks. You pay to go to Michael Symon's restaurant, not because it's that great, but to say you went. I certainly won't be going again."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance of restaurant, the service was good, however my meal was not as good as advertised.  Next time I will order different"}
{"text":"Took the wife to Lolita after hearing good things about it and knowing that Michael Symon is an Iron Chef, although he wasn't present the evening we visited.

We had a reservation, so we only waited five minutes to sit and the ambiance was very inviting.  Candles were lit and the open wood-fired stove looked really cool, but I felt bad for the cooks who have to stand right in front of it all evening without much room to shuffle around.  I have to admit, I felt a little cramped in our seats with other people sitting only one to two feet away.  I don't like to listen involuntarily to private conversations around me.

I ordered the signature Mac N Cheese dish which was very rich and came with slices of chicken on the bottom.  The flavor of the pasta was great, very rich and cheesy, but the chicken on the bottom tasted old, salty, and like it had sat out all day before it was cooked.  This was anti-climactic and the only negative point of the evening.

My wife had chicken on the bone which was delicious and well cooked.  The drinks were terrific, the wait staff was great and overall, it was a very nice dining experience.  I just didn't understand the flavor of the chicken in the Mac n Cheese dish.

For the price and ambiance, I recommend Lolita.

{"text":"WAITING:
- Sunday night at 7pm. Waited 5 minutes to be seated. Had a reservation.
- About 15-20 minutes waiting for each course.

SERVICE:
- Water refilled water quickly, table cleaned after each course promptly.

APPETIZER - MUSSELS:
- Highly recommend them.
- If most other mussels are prepared well-done, these were medium-rare. Very succulent. Moist. Melts like butter, with waves of ocean.
- Sauce: rich in cream with some spicy note. Very flavorful and complex.

APPETIZER - BONE MARROW:
- Interesting dish. Worth getting once.
- Interesting to look at. Big cross-section of bone with jelly-like bone marrow with some greens filling in the middle.
- Served with toasts and pickled veggies.
- The bone marrow tastes like an interesting butter, in gelatin, animalistic form. 
- Definitely interesting experience. The toast itself is unremarkable.
- Seasoning: has citrous note that balances the fatty richness of bone marrow. Very intricate.

ENTREE: PORK CHOP:
- Highly recommend them
- Some parts more moist and medium, while other parts cooked more thoroughly. Overall very tender.
- Plentiful serving.
- Seasoning: the white creamy sauce with the pickled vegetables were eye-awakening. Tangy and new. Balances the meat very well. 

SIDE DISH: BRUSSEL SPROUTS
- Highly recommend them
- Unevenly distributed tangy vinegar taste. The random striking of the palate makes the tasting more interesting.
- Sauteed pretty heavily, which brings smoked flavor that adds to the complexity of the taste.
- Not going to bring incredibly rich, creamy profile, but very enjoyable side-dish in its own right."}
{"text":"I had the burger and fried Brussels sprouts. They were both delicious. The burger is $5 during happy hour. You can't beat that."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong. The food was pretty good- four stars for the food. I just thought the convenience of the restaurant almost made me not want to eat there.

Michael Symon restaurants are interesting. They're all a tad different. My friends and I tried to get there for their famous happy hour....and they got stuck in traffic. I got there...and was told I could only get happy hour around the bar. What? Seriously? There were literally only 7 stools. So only 7 people could get happy hour? Wha the. The host didn't even try to offer any help or any suggestions. She's like \"you could stand\"...but where???? My friends were still late, so I just sat down at the table.

The waiter came by..and he seemed friendly. I asked him, \"do you think there's still a way to get happy hour?\" It reminded me of a restaurant in DC, where I couldn't get happy hour either, even tho the \"happy hour table\" was only 2 feet away. Anyways, back to Lolita, the waiter replied, \"oh yeah, just stand right behind the people sitting... I'm sure if your friends are a little late, you guys can still grab happy hour.\" Thank you. That's what I wanted to hear.

I stood off to the side, where, yet another waitress kept pushing me out of the way. Good grief. Anyways, the nice bartender saw me (oh the joys of being short. :P) and handed me a menu. I got some type of ginger drink, Joyce P got the red, and our other friend, a water. Off the happy hour menu, all of our orders tasted great. The mussels- flavorful and plentiful and not overcooked. The mac n cheese!!! That was my favorite. It had chicken and goat cheese...and I don't know, it was SOOO flavorful. And the chickpeas too! We got full just off of three appetizers.

I liked the restaurant, I really did. It's pretty small, but the overall look of the restaurant looks clean and organized. But c'mon, I just wish it would have been more convenience. That can TOTALLY kill a dinner. Food = good, convenience= not so much."}
{"text":"I was expecting to eat a lot of burgers and fries when I was visiting Cleveland so when I heard heralded Iron Chef Michael Symon had a bunch of restaurants here, it was a no brainer to check out Lolita.

The location of this restaurant is a little strange.  Maybe I'm just not used to the area but the neighborhood looked a bit run down, and I wasn't expecting to see any restaurants next to a bunch of old houses, but there it was.

Once inside, the inviting decor is rustic yet modern with a local pub-like warmth to it.  Their menu consists of short yet interesting selection of items broken down by five categories: Starters, Cured Meats, Pizza, Pasta, and Entrees.  Dishes such as pig ears n' tails, roasted dates, bone marrow, duck confit, and crispy chicken livers definitely caught my attention and tells you a lot of the aspirations of this place.

The food was appetizing and well presented.  Brussels sprouts were fried to a unique crisp.  The mussels were moist not rubbery.  The fried chicken livers over polenta was probably my favorite, but I'm a sucker for chicken liver.  The entrees could've been a bit more outside the box than the starters.  Pork chops could've been more flavorful. The gnocchi was completely forgettable.

Overall though, I must say I applaud the effort and execution for sure.  Judging by the neighborhood, this place definitely stands out as an oasis for foodies."}
{"text":"Lolita was an excellent dining experience, and I cannot wait to eat here again (or try Lola at some point).  The restaurant is right in the heart of Tremont, in a very cute, young neighborhood.  The atmosphere is very laid back and unpretentious, features an open kitchen, and would be great for a date.  

The food is, in a word, great.  The chickpea dip (read: hummus) appetizer is unbelievably smooth and tasty, while the pork chop entree was perfectly grilled and clearly the pride of pork-loving Michael Symon's bill of fare.  The drinks were delicious too, and I'd highly recommend the Delta if you're in the mood for a good buzz.

Lolita lived up to the hype for me and, as Douglas MacArthur famously said, I shall return."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland! I would strongly recommend the pig ear and tail dish in the appetizer section. It has multiple layers of flavors that hit you at different times. It was strong enough to cover the pig smell but the after taste was somewhat almost too sweet for my taste. The bone marrow dish was pretty ok too - it was very fatty and did not have as many flavors as the pig dish, but it was pretty well done."}
{"text":"Lolita is my favorite restaurant in Cleveland.  Every time we come here, the food and service is amazing.  We went here for happy hour recently, and you can't beat their happy hour.  You have to get there early to get in, but if you do, everything on the happy hour menu is $5 or less, including cocktails.  The Lolita burger has ruined me for burgers anywhere else.  Grass-fed beef burger on an english muffin, topped with bacon and a fried egg on top.  There's no reason to even add Heinz to this thing.  The mussels are amazing also - mussels with white wine, and chorizo.  And, you can't go wrong with the mac and cheese, which is creamy and rich, and also has chicken in it.  

And, if you're planning on dinner, get the smoked meats board, the steak is amazing also, and the pizzas are a great option, too.  The other great thing about this place is that they're really not that expensive - most entrees are $14-$20 with very few over $20.  

Love Lolita!!"}
{"text":"At the risk of sounding too Humbert about it all, \"It was she who seduced me\".  That nymphette Lolita!  Mon cher chou and I were completely infatuated.

THE FOOD:  Delightful.  The mediterranean inspired menu offered so much.  We chose the chicken liver and roasted shrimp appetizers.  The livers were tender, with a crispy crust acommpanied by an insanely rich creamy polenta.  The shrimp had a great fire roasted flavor.

Mon Cher chou had the pork chop special.  Mercy, that was the best pig I have ever tried.  And I am a firm believer in the pig.  Tender like no other.  I had the veal shank.  That was fall off the bone tender and accompanied by a rich sauce.  The marrow was a decadent treat. The eggplant side was a nice greek/italian melange,much like the chef himself.

Dessert was a chocolate pot de creme with salt and chantilly cream-- chocolate pudding for adults.  Oh yeah.

The drinks were really fun as well.  Each one bears a greek letter as a name.  I had the beta-- ginger infused vodka and soda.  It was like a very sophisticated ginger ale.  Mon cher chou had the eta--vodka, ouzo and something red.  Wooo, strong and herbal!

THE ATMOSPHERE:  Still cool after all these years.  Low light, interesting art, moody, sexy atmosphere.   It's perfect for a first romantic date or a hundreth romantic date.  If you have the perfect date, all the better.

THE SERVICE:  Cool without being hipster.  Friendly and candid without TMI.  These foodies know their stuff.  They are required to try all the food (tough job, but someone has to do it) so they can really give an accurate and informative opinion.  

\"Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul.\""}
{"text":"There's not much I can add here that likely hasn't been said before ad nauseum so here's my abbreviated version:

Blah blah Micheal Symon blah blah roasted bone marrow blah blah crispy chicken livers blah blah lamb steak blah blah delicious blah blah delicious blah blah delicious blah blah delicious.  

Put on some nice clothes. Make a reservation.  Spend some money on yourself. You deserve it."}
{"text":"It's not often I get to review a restaurant while simultaneously watching the chef on television. Such is the celebrity of Michael Symon. 

For starters, Lolita has one of the most well-designed spaces I've ever dined in. As opposed to the military and Euclidean efficiency of most restaurant layouts, Lolita flows intimately in its small space, with half-a-dozen unique seating areas, making every seat in the house look and feel like the VIP section. The open kitchen adjacent to the bar provides constant entertainment, and the lighting and music created the perfect atmosphere. Nothing gimmicky. Just great design. 

The food was very good, but I wasn't blown away by anything, except for the brussel sprouts side dish (no joke!!!) and the desserts. The Great Lakes Edmund Fitzgerald ice cream (fondly recalling memories of the \"beer floats\" I experimented with in college) and the slightly-salty Chocolate Pot du Creme were the perfect ending to the meal....subtle and delicious. (They also feature Dolce dessert wine...which is like LIQUID f'ing GOLD.) 

I'm afraid I may have ordered poorly elsewhere. Emboldened by having watched the entire Andrew Zimmern TV marathon the previous day (sauteed yak penis, anyone?), I ordered the roasted bone marrow. I have absolutely no basis of comparison, having never eaten bone-marrow before, but it was pretty damn tasty. However, I also quickly learned that bone-marrow is nauseatingly rich, so I staggered through it and was very glad when it was all over with.

Then, I ordered the hanger steak entree, curious to see what Mr. Symon could do with the humble hanger steak. As it turns out, not much. The dish had nothing to say except, \"here's your charred meat and some bland chickpeas.\" It was something of a head-scratcher. My wife had the fish special: wild striped bass with oyster mushrooms and cauliflower puree. It was very smooth and deftly prepared, but again lacked any sort of wow factor. 

Maybe my expectations were out of line. The prices were reasonable, and we were able to get last-minute reservations on a Friday night, so I'll be back again to try something else."}
{"text":"It's Michael Symon.  Not sure what more needs said, other than he lives up to his reputation, putting out amazing meals at reasonable prices.  The staff is awesome and the food is even better!"}
{"text":"I walked through the doors at Lolita just after 5pm on a Tuesday with every intention of taking advantage of the very reasonable (and delicious) happy hour specials (only available at the bar, 5pm-7pm and then again late night).   My drink order went according to plan, ordering the bela off of the happy hour menu at the reasonable price of $5.  This was a tasty concoction of house-made ginger infused vodka, lime juice, & soda.  Quite refreshing on a hot summer day, a tad on the small side but plenty strong.  Later, I ordered a Sierra Nevada at only $2 also from the happy hour menu.

Ready to place my order of steamed mussels and a side of brussel sprouts my waiter had to go and ruin all of my diligent planning by uttering some of the greatest words known to man...pig roast!  Apparently, Tuesday is whole hog night at Lolita (didn't find this tasty tidbit of information anywhere on their website).  The sides rotate, but the night I was there the pork was accompanied by a sublimely creamy side of polenta.  The shredded/pulled pork, served with a mojo style sauce, had great flavor and was a very ample portion ($19).  The only downside were some pieces that were slightly dry, although I guess this is expected when roasting an entire pig due to the different cook times needed for various cuts.  

I'll definitely go back to Lolita when in Cleveland.  The menu is reasonably priced for the quality of ingredients and preparation that you'll be getting.  Happy hour is an outright bargain!  For those planning to take advantage of happy hour my suggestion is to go early.  The bar seats approximately 12 and was full at about 5:45pm."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, great service at a fair price."}
{"text":"Surely most of us come to this place because of Michael Symon. It is very wise to have fewer menu items and affordable pricing for Lolita, a quite small property. It is quite noticeable that ingredients are well-selected and freshly-cooked, and I am sure the managers put much effort in purchasing high-quality ingredients. I do not have any complaints about the quality of ingredients and the perfection of cooking precision at all. The only thing I felt confused about was the flavor. Most of dishes tasted plain and bland which got me confused because I was not sure if this was intended by the restaurant concept. \"Fresh, healthy and natural\" may be the reasons behind. But I just thought a good chef knows how to use natural to create memorable flavors, too. A tourist must-go!"}
{"text":"The taste of this restaurant is fantastic! The mussels were exceptionally good, especially the sauce. The risotto was flavored perfectly.

However, there was a long wait for the risotto. After around 40 minutes of waiting for the risotto, I finally got my dish. While flavored perfectly, the risotto was crunchy, which was really disappointing given the amount of time I waited for it."}
{"text":"The regular and late night happy hours are worth going to. The regular is from 5-6:30 and late night is 9:30 to close. The mac and cheese, hamburger and ricotta dip are all satisfying and good deals during happy hour. I have tried the Lamb Steak and Roasted Chicken. Both were great. I prefer Lamb as it is right for my blood type and great tasting! A good place to take someone so they think you know what you are talking about. They will think you are a big shot."}
{"text":"Wow o wow.  Desperately tried to not  let my attitude towards Michael Symon bias my opinion of his restaurant, but boy, great food network star, great TV chef, GREAT restaurant!  Had the bone marrow appetizer (recommend by my BF) even though I've had BM before and wasn't really a fan.  This one however, was phenomenal.  The BM is seasoned with some scallion and salsa and paired with delicious grilled bread (I know, it's just grilled bread...but for some reason, it was really uber good).  Give this a try and you'll never want to use olive oil or butter to season your bread.

Then I had the duck breast entree: yum, yuuuuum, tender meat, not gamy, and perfectly garnished with a butternut squash puree mildly seasoned with ginger (\"ginger\" was not described on the menu, but I'm pretty sure it's in this dish, so if you're not a big fan of that, you might want to try something else).  The prunes give it just the right amount of sweet and tart flavor while the hazelnuts add a nice touch of crunch for texture.  

Tried the rapini and brussel sprouts sides: rapini was slightly oversalted (this is the only complaint I would have), but otherwise okay.  Brussel sprouts were excellent.  Just the right amount of char on the outside and soft crunch on the inside.  At the same time, it was appropriated seasoned and the walnuts again added another layer of crunch.  

The service was good and the staff were attentive.  My party was initially seated at a very cute corner seat, which would have been really nice, but in the dead of winter, the draft from the entrance had us asking for another seat, which was graciously granted.  

Overall, a casual, yet sophisticated place.  Classy place with amazing food without any snobby overtone.  Lolita is definitely not for the faint of heart and anyone on a low fat diet.  Symon admits to using lard, but I have to say, the man puts it to good use!

(An aside: I went to B-spot a few times and the New Jack City burger is one of my all time favorite burgers.  So if you want a taste of Symon, but an even more casual and affordable place: B-spot hits the spot every time!)"}
{"text":"LOVED it.  Great food, and great value.

I wouldn't recommend it for vegetarians though - I think every single entree had meat of some sort in it."}
{"text":"I love Lolita's happy hour! The great drinks and the amazing food don't compare to the AWESOME bartender serving us. I forget her name, but she rocks. We ordered mussels, mac and cheese, and a friend got the cheese platter for us all to share. Truffle honey!!! That's all I'll say about that.

The dessert was amazing too, though I forget the name. I will always be back to this place!"}
{"text":"I was really iffy about taking my first trip to Lolita. I was afraid I'd be greeted with a \"yuppie\" atmosphere and food. I was scared of being stuck with a menu of words I wouldn't understand and a bunch of strange animal parts I didn't want to eat. Luckily, that wasn't the case! I had one of my best dining experiences ever at Lolita.

My boyfriend and I had a reservation and were seated right away at this cozy booth in the corner. They didn't have the biggest wine or cocktail list I've seen, but we really liked the drink selections we picked.  We decided on an eggplant dip appetizer and it was pure heaven. We got the porkchop with brussel sprouts and the hangar steak. My pork was cooked to perfection and melted in my mouth. The steak was a bit underwhelming compared to the pork, but it was still very tasty. For anyone who is a little less adventurous like us, the pork is a winner!

The service was superb and the atmosphere was much less noisy than I expected. The servers were educated on the menu and I felt confident in my order. Lolita has become one of my favorite restaurants after just one trip!"}
{"text":"I got there through Yelp....and I am so so glad!! If you're un cleveland don't miss Lolita! Lovely place, great ambience, friendly staff and superb food.
Happy hour At the bar offers half portions of the best dishes and drinks on the menu
Don't miss the mac&cheese with goat cheese.....worth coming back for"}
{"text":"My mom & I were at home watching food network when I got an idea...a wonderfully wicked idea. We decided to trick my dad into driving to Cleveland to visit a family friend..once there we had a 'mystery destination' for dinner. We headed to Lolita...my dad had been wanting to try this restaurant for a long time. We walked in & were seated right away, the decor was casual yet upscale. The food was some of the best I have ever eaten. We shared a Big Board of cured meats, the spring pea dip & the bruschetta....a meal in & of itself. For my entree I ordered the pulled pork Buccatini. My mom ordered the duck gnocci & dad got the roasted chicken...EVERYTHING WAS AMAZING!!!! This was easily one of the best meals of my life. I will be going back."}
{"text":"What can I say....I found myself in Cleveland and Michael Symon has a booming business with his establishments.   I found myself in this trendy little neighborhood with the sole purpopse of coming to Lolita.   It was the ending of happy hour upon my arrival and they had a full house as far as tables go. I waited about 15 minutes for a bar spot to open up.  It was worth the wait.  The bartender was super nice and helpful with suggestions and pairings.   I had a glass of wine while I waited for my steak.  Which was cooked perfectly and the flavors that were involved were amazing.  The side of parmesan polenta was enough to make me happy just to eat it.   I got the Peach Amaretto Trifle for dessert....upon recommendation as the peaches were fresh from farm to table within two hours.   It was the perfect summer dessert. Not to heavy not to unsweet.   Way to go Lolita staff one of the best meals I've had in a while."}
{"text":"K and I are hosting an exchange student this year which means even more travel than usual.  We were looking for a quick weekend getaway that wouldn't require pulling her out of school or a long drive and decided on Cleveland so that we could visit The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  Kris mentioned this spot and we put it on our list.

Yes, it's over the bridge and through a neighborhood from where most of your Cleveland time will be spent if you're visiting but it is well worth it.  Wow.

First and foremost: make reservations.  We didn't call until we got into town and had to take a 10 pm reservation Saturday night.  This was fine since we were going to the Cavs game but I'm sure not everyone out there wants to do a 10 pm dinner.  We had a drink in the bar before dinner - K enjoyed a beer off of their impressive beer list and I had a prosecco.  Their drink offering is great, perfect for snobs like us.

We were seated at a nice sized table which we've come not to expect now that we're a threesome.  We always seem to get crowded at two tops but not here.  We shared an app and got three different entrees and were all blown away by the quality of food, service, the ambiance and the AMAZING music.  I don't think I heard a single thing I didn't like and it was pretty much the soundtrack I've been listening to since secondary school (80's/90's new wave/alternative... so good).  

We will definitely be back when we are in town again and it's now our top-recommended dinner destination to friends headed to Cleveland for work and play."}
{"text":"After dining at Lola twice, I decided that for my birthday dinner, it was time to give her \"little sister\" a try. The table started with the big board of charcuterie--easily the most spectacular thing I've eaten in quite some time. The board featured sopressata, copa, lardo, pate with duck confit and currants, chicken liver and pancetta mousse, tasso style duck, cured pork tenderloin, and accompaniments (pickled carrots and onions,  apriot and cherry jams, crostini). Immediately after the board was served, the manager approached our table and apologized profusely for forgetting prosciutto. It was an error we likely wouldn't have otherwise noticed given the mountain of meat before us. He went above and beyond and gave us what could only be described as a bowl of prosciutto to make up for leaving it off. All the meat except for the prosciutto is cured in-house and they were nothing short of sublime. The board was perfect for three people; I think it might be a bit much for two if you plan on ordering entrees after though.

I had the duck confit--served with romesco sauce, grilled onions, slivered almonds, and kumquats. I chose the fried brussel sprouts as my side. Another person at the table ordered the duck confit as well with corn on the cob. And finally, the last member of our party ordered the pork chops served over canellini beans with a bright citrus sauce and the potato torta side. They were grilled perfectly and the beans were flavorful. The torta was custardy and light. I was stunned when my entree arrived with not one but TWO duck legs. The meat was so tender and juicy, complemented by the Spanish style onions, almonds, and romesco. While I did enjoy the kumquats, as I ate more of the dish, the more I found the sweetness to be slightly overpowering, and I wound up leaving quite a bit of it behind. My brussel sprouts served as a perfect counterpoint to those sweet notes; they weren't breaded, but rather pan fried, tossed in anchovies, capers, and walnuts which made them perfectly salty, crunchy, and addictive. The portion was massive. 

By that point, we were too stuffed for dessert, but they looked tasty. Our friendly waitress was more than happy to box a leftover duck leg and the rest of my brussel sprouts.  

What I like about Lolita is that you can choose how upscale you want your meal to be. While we elected to have some of the 'fancier' entrees (still a great value at around $25), we could have just as easily split the pizzas, which at around 15 dollars are affordable, and from what we saw at other tables--huge and good for sharing. 

Lolita is more laid back than Lola and the prices reflect this. I was pleased that the more casual atmosphere didn't mean a diminished quality of food. Everything was up to the impressive precedent Lola set (in fact, we actually think the charcuterie board at Lolita is better than what we've had at Lola!) If Lola is the place you go for a once-a-year blowout, Lolita is where you can hang out with your friends and indulge on a more regular basis. The bar happy hour specials seem like a real boon, featuring wine and cocktail specials and $5 appetizers. 

For an excellent fine dining experience without all of the fussiness some upscale restaurants might have, visit Lolita. The service, the menu's range, and most imporantly, the food, were a delight."}
{"text":"Great food! Excellent ambiance! Perfect for dates and special occasions. Just plan ahead and make a reservation."}
{"text":"Great bar staff. Chicken livers were great. Mushroom pizza with pancetta added and Brussel sprouts on the side.  All excellent"}
{"text":"ROASTED BONE MARROW! Really that's the only reason that you need but everything else here is excellent. I took my bf for his birthday and the staff was attentive and polite. The food was delicious. I've had Lola (also good) but this is casual version with all the flavor for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I really reallly liked this place, so much so it has earned a 5 star rating.  I've been to over 150 new and different restaurants coast to coast this past year alone and only three have gotten this rating,,, so why the 5 stars??  I'm in Cleveland for business yesterday and supposed to drive home last night, but decided to stay to check out this joint.  There was a small group of us mostly business associates/friends who share my love for drinking, food and general merryment.  I'm familiar with Michael Symon from TV and Tony Bourdain's cleveland \"no reservations\" tv show, so I was more than happy to visit this little place.  Michael seemed like a lot of fun on bourdain's show, with his outgoing personality and outrageous laugh, however I certainly didn't expect to see the food network's celebrity \"iron chef\" there, but nonetheless hoped to enjoy his food.  We get there about 730 on a Tuesday night and the place is lively and relatively packed with great lighting and a very relaxiing vibe.  The place seems much larger than it is because of the crafty use of lighting and mirrors.  I love how the tables are set up almost like in little hideaway coves providing some privace to the diners in such an intimate setting.  It is a casual joint, with plenty wearing jeans, but is stylish and inviting.  We enter and are greeted warmly by a young lady who says it's about 20 minutes for a table which is fine, since we don't have a reservation.  Head over to the bar which seats about 8 folks I'd say.  THe bar itself is great located next to the open kitchen and wood buring fire pit for the delicious pizza.  The place has great copper ceilings and retains much of the original charm of this (i'm guessing) 100 year old + building.  I order a shyraz that is served in a stemlass glass (which I like), it's a good choice served by a friendly bartender (pour was a bit light, but i'm not a regular) at a good price ($8).  I look around a bit and bam! There's chef Symon being videotaped by a food network crew, guess I just lucked out... Staying true to my chef fan non shy style I ask for a picture and he is more than happy to comply and takes a picture with that demonic laugh (picture posted as restaurant picture), and then before you know it the food network is taping us and talking with us and we're signing releases to be on this show airing in the summer.  Pretty cool bonus.  Then we're seated at a very cool table facing the bar.  Okay, onto the food.  I'm not in cleveland much so I want to have a full sampling of a lot of different stuff that I can't get in the burgh', while encouraging my friends to be a little adventorous with me.  We start with some perfectly acceptable bread and dip, but whatever on to the meal... We start with two orders of bone marrow, which is delicious butter of the gods served spread liberally on perfectly toasted crusty bread seasoned with scallions and some type of \"salsa\", next we have one order of pig ears (yeah baby!, this took some prodding but most enjoyed) they were crispy on the outside breaded and lightly fried and not too chewy.  We also had one of the best stuffed peppers I've ever eaten, sweet sausage, spicy pepper, great red sauce good quality cheese.  We also tried the \"warm\" olives, which were good quality olives and having them served warm adds a new dimension... Mussels that were good quality, sausage was spicy and good (this dude knows pig), white whine and butter broth,,, also from the appetizer list was lamb \"heart\" bruschetta, pretty good,, not gamy and good sweet caramalized onions, crispy chicken livers (this was a bit of a miss), the polenta wasn't that good and the chicken livers were overcooked (can't all be winners), I didn't order an entree after all of this, but Keith had the roasted chicken which loooked deliciuos and juicy,,,  He originally wanted the tuesday roast pig special, but they were out,,, then halfway through his chicken they bring him a 1/2 serving of this delicious roasted pig,, NO CHARGE, John had there \"signature\" mac and cheese, which I did sample and it was one of the most rich deliciuosl pastas I've ever had.  Ed had some type of pork shank (it was good, fall of the bone huge well seasoned), Malana had the pizza, which had great sausage good cheese and  a wonderful crust, whe also tried there signature brussel sprouts which were different in a good way from any brussel sprouts I've ever had.  The server, suzie was nice and professional, but not overly talkative or intrusive.  She threw in three complimentary desserts that were pretty good,,, and after all of this,,, the total cost was ONLY $196.91 for 5 of us with drinks, not including tip... If this place was in my town, I'd be there twice a week at least... loved it!"}
{"text":"After experiencing Lola and Lolita on consecutive nights, I can confidently say that Lolita = deeelicious, and Lola = overrated and overpriced. 

Lolita offers many similar menu items as Lola (i.e. Pork Chop, Sirloin, Beet Salad, etc), but only at half the price. The restaurant has a more open and welcoming environment (though it would almost be considered hipster if this place was in LA). Most importantly, the food at Lolita is more unique and just tastes better. While the food at Lola was good, I was not impressed by any of it. It tasted good, but it didn't make me happy. The food at Lolita, on the other hand, made me a very happy girl.

Appetizers:
Duck Meatballs - good, but doesn't really taste like duck

Charred Eggplant Dip - surprisingly yummy. doesn't taste like eggplant at all. kind of felt like I was eating a super smooth hummus with amazing pita

Maple Glazed Pork Belly - GET IT. 'nuff said.

Mushroom Pizza - good, but nothing special. It was also super oily on the bottom, pizza-hut style. Don't think that was necessary.


Entree:
Roasted Suckling Pig (Tuesday Special!) - Really tender and flavorful. Apparently they only offer this on Tuesdays. Kind of reminds me of the Hawaiian Kalua Pig.

Bone Marrow Crusted Sirloin - Presentation was lacking (looked like a giant baked potato) but the meat was cooked to perfection and I loved the grilled onions that came with it.

Grilled Walleye - GET IT. This was cooked in a prosciutto broth with prosciutto strips on top. Drool.

Sides:
Fried Brussels Sprouts - GET IT. As the server said, the best thing that happened to Brussels sprouts. It could be kind of salty at times though, but still a must try.

Soft Polenta with mascarpone and parmesan - This one sounded better than it tasted. I would've liked the polenta a little sweeter. Not impressed."}
{"text":"I have been attending dinner parties here for years.  The food is delicious.  The specials are always the way to go.  If you haven't dipped a brussel sprout in the polenta you haven't lived.  The portion sizes have become smaller over the trips, but that doesn't stop us.  Also, the Lolita martini is the drink to order, over and over."}
{"text":"Lolita is one of my favorite places in Tremont.  Hands down.

In fact, even my \"I hate pretentious/fancy food/anything other than a burger\" boyfriend loves Lolita.  It's kind of our one happy meeting point.  

The service has always been good, with attentive water-pourers, wait-staff. bartenders, and hostesses.  

I typically hit up Lolita for the Happy Hour or the Late Night Happy Hour.  When you add it all together, that pretty much covers the whole evening, so your chances are good for just randomly rolling in and hitting it.  

Everything on the menu is amazing.  Ah-Maz-Ing.  The fried brussel sprouts absolutely melt in your mouth.  The mussels are steamed in this delicious butter sauce that I just want to dunk everything in, even after the mussels are long gone.  The riccotta dip is fresh and light and somehow perfect with their flat bread.  The Mac and cheese is the best in town and...drum roll...the there is the Lolita burger.  Oh, Lolita burger...every time I eat you, I close my eyes and just enjoy the experience.  Did I mention everything is just $5 plates with a $2 Sierra Nevada?  

Mmm....Lolita."}
{"text":"My hubs and I have a tradition  of going out for dinner either the day before or after Valentines Day. When we sat down and thought about it, the last 3 years we've gone to Lola. This year we decided to try Lolita. So glad we did. 

We made a reservation for relatively early on the 13th. 
We got there and the table was ready and the hostess and server were very friendly. Starting off well. 

We started with the ceviche and the soup of the day, mushroom soup. I know those two things don't really pair well, but we wanted to try both, so we went for it. The mushroom soup was a standout and I would go back just for that soup. Yum. 
The ceviche was good, but I didn't think it was anything super special (but the rest of the meal made up for it).
 
For the entree I went with the hangar steak. I'd had a different preparation previously at Lola and it was awesome so there were high expectations. Lolita did not disappoint. Perfectly cooked, great sauce, avocados paired nicely. Even better was the polenta I had for a side with the steak. I didn't know that polenta could be described and light and airy, but this stuff was- I don't know how he did it. 
The hubs had the butternut squash risotto for dinner. When he took the first bite, you could just tell he loved it. Smooth, great flavors. Would totally get that again as well.
And since it was a \"holiday\" we splurged on dessert - the bread pudding and the goat cheese panna cotta. Both were good, but the goat cheese panna cotta was outstanding. Not super sweet but a great way to end the meal. And the figs on top? I could eat a pound of those. 

So, after this meal at Lolita, we've done 4 consecutive Valentines Day's at a Michael Symon restaurant. Guess its a new Valentines tradition! Maybe next year we will get to eat at Symon's new place!"}
{"text":"We came here on the night before a wedding we had to go to in Akron, so this restaurant was basically the only place we visited while in the Cleveland area.

I give it a five stars because the food was wonderfully crafted. The portions were definitely reasonable, and the ingredients were definitely fresh. Our food consisted of:

1) the Tremont apple cocktail - which had rum (I think), some apple tasting liquid, coriander and cloves. (I got it because of the two last ingredients). The way it went down was really smooth! At first it tasted like one of those normal apple mixer cocktails, that would get sweet and tart at the middle of  the drinking experience and then alcoholic and gross as you swallowed it down - but that was not the case. After the sweet and tart taste point, the coriander and the cloves helped seal the goodness of the drink. I highly recommend this drink. Plus they served it to me in one of those whiskey/scotch glasses so I didn't feel like I was drinking an entirely girly drink...not that being a girl is bad. I just felt cool.

2) Roasted dates - if I didn't see that it got good Yelp reviews was pretty tasty. At first, the taste of the dates was very overpowering... but the combination with the pancetta and parsley balanced the sweetness.

3) (Fried) brussel sprouts - also surprisingly awesome. The brussel sprouts were charred (which is why \"fried\" is in parentheses), which canceled out any bitter tastes that brussel sprouts have. The vegetables swam in a dish of walnuts, capers, chilies and anchovies. Our waitress at the bar recommended it to us, and said it reminded her of a kimchi type dish. It was definitely interested as to how the dish had an\"asian\" flavor to it, without the use of asian ingredients.

4) Lamb steak - which wasn't as creative as the other dishes I had, but I needed protein that night and wanted fresh vegetables (it contained fresh arugula, diced grape tomatoes). It also had feta cheese and sat in a balsamic glaze - yum.

5) Sopresatta cured meat dish - also pretty awesome. They gave us (what my boyfriend would describe as the best) pickles to cut through the fat of the meat, blanched apples and pears, and bread crisps to go along with the meat.

As for the rest of this place, the ambiance was nice. The decor was a fusion of 1920's industrial interior with modern lighting and random decoratives (ie a small, capiz lantern, a 'shower' curtain hung on a round ring - guess you have to go there to see what I mean). It's a great place to also go if you want something nice and quick late at night.

Also, reservations are certainly recommended. We flew in from Boston and got there at 9pm not really knowing we should have made reservations. We were able to squeeze ourselves at the bar on one seat and then comfortably eat when seats cleared up. But it's probably something you don't want to count on doing since I think we just got lucky."}
{"text":"I have to say I was dissapointed in both Lolita and Lola. There are so many better restaurant choices in Cleveland if you are looking for a nice night out. My husband said his Salmon was excellent but my Gnocci was eh as was the small plate of Macaroni we shared.  We have since been back for drinks and it's a fun atmosphere for sipping cocktails and relaxing.  The pizza that the people next to us at the bar were eating looked yummy so I wouldn't mind trying that next time."}
{"text":"One of the best Cleveland has to offer. We don't stop here often because its a little pricier than we usually opt for, but every time we've been the food has been incredibly delicious and surprising. Love the bone marrow appetizer and the brussel sprouts as a side, and of course anything with pork is a MUST here! Make a reservation and treat yourself once in a while, definitely worth it in my opinion!"}
