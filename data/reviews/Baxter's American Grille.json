{"text":"Most definitely my first choice for a fine dinner or lunch in Champaign. Nice, clean, classy environment with attentive and courteous staff. They start you off with warm rolls and creamy butter. From there,  you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. I do recommend the calamari, jambalaya, and my favorite, the prime rib, always on point. The deserts are extraordinarily good too. Check it out!"}
{"text":"The Bistro Fried Chicken is amazing. My husband got a steak and it was cooked to perfection. Service was great and nice atmosphere. Rolls were tasty as well. Very satisfied."}
{"text":"We've been to the Champaign Baxter's three times now and have had great meals each time. I've actually ordered the filet each time, and it's always a good cut and prepared exactly right. Baxter's is now our go-to steak house in town because it is the best combo of great food, lively atmosphere, food service, and affordability. Their desserts are great too!"}
{"text":"First time here. It is not cheap, but you definitely get what you pay for. The food was very, very good and the service was excellent.  We started with an appetizer of steak nachos. Wife had Caesars Salad and I had Kale and Basil Chicken soup. She had a Parmesan Top Sirloin and I had the NY Strip. They were both cooked to order perfectly!!!  As we were celebrating her birthday, they brought her Gooey Butter Cake. It was excellent!!!"}
{"text":"My first time to eat at Baxter's over the weekend on a Saturday night.  I really liked it.  We have reservations with no wait time.  The table was nice, everything clean and great atmosphere.  I liked their menu and am looking forward to going back for another selection.  The salad served with my entree was very good and fresh.  I had the halibut which was good.  Others in the party liked their food and especially enjoyed the gooey butter cake.  The atmosphere and decor was very nice. The waiter was great and my water glass was always full. I can't wait to try it again."}
{"text":"The service was awesome. The food was great we had the prime rib and smothered chicken. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"wow, 10 minutes and waiting to be greeted  on a friday night. please fix the inconsistency!"}
{"text":"First time having dinner here. We order drinks which were delicious,but the food wasn't that great. Prices weren't bad at all like a lot of the reviews say they were high in price, I didn't think so at all. They had live music and for a Saturday night it wasn't busy so I gave this place three stars because it's a good place to have a few drinks."}
{"text":"Very nice place to eat can't wait for another round here. They know how to treat customers, and pour wine."}
{"text":"Had the gluten free pizza and was impressed with the number of toppings they piled on. Supposedly they have a good gluten free protocol to avoid cross contamination which is important. Dining companion had their daily special which was pasta in a carrot-chicken sauce with scallops. Odd pairing to have chicken in a sauce for  scallops? He said it was ok, the sauce had an odd flavor., probably wouldn't order again. Took a star away due to the prices, $27 at lunch between us and we only had water to drink. Would probably return but only for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Simply awesome! This restaurant is so much better than many other fancy places on Neil. Everything is super flavorful and seasoned perfectly! Even the most common dishes such as ribs and steak that you can find in every American restaurant tastes subtly different here and I really like it."}
{"text":"Food good. Nice atmosphere, warm and comfortable. Drinks disappointing, expensive and weak"}
{"text":"I am literally in love with Baxter's! This was my 2nd time visiting the restaurant, the first time was during restaurant week in February. I had the catch of the day which was cod, if I remember correctly it was poached. The dish came with a salad (i got the caesar) and a dessert. The dish was delicious and the portion sizes were very adequate. I tried to eat it all but was to full, I brought it home but it never made the fridge as my husband ate it, he also stating it was delicious.  The caesar salad was delicious and plentiful. I am particular about caesar as this is the only type of salad that I will eat. The flavor balanced out very well, not too vinegary.  Unfortunately, I did not taste the dessert as I don't have much of a sweet tooth. During the visit, what stood out the most was the awesome service. My friend and I sat at the Bar. It was a Thursday night and we just missed the live music that they have every Thursday evening. The bartender (whom I later found out name was Brandon) came right over to greet us. The entire night he was very attentive, taking his time to make recommendations to the menu, and making sure that we were always checked on.  I can honestly say this is the best service that I have had from a Bartender in a very long time. As we visited during restaurant week the prices were pri-fix, however, glancing at the menu their regular prices weren't bad either. I knew that I needed to visit again to see if Baxter's held up service/food quality outside of an event/special.  I brought my husband this time to visit Baxter's to get his take on the restaurant. He was kind of skeptical since I had been raving on it every since I went in Feb. This time we visited on a Saturday and again choose to sit at the bar. Brandon was again working which I was happy to see. Again, this visit didn't disappoint and even exceeded the service/food that I initially experienced.  We started off with drinks, I got the cherry old fashioned and hubby got a manhattan. We both ordered off the signature drink menu and  boy were we not disappointed. The drinks were not watered down and had a good alcohol to non-alcohol content, a great bang for your buck! While my husband was trying to decide which bourbon to have his made with, Brandon was patient, offered suggestions, and even let him sample a couple of bourbons!  It was such good customer service. I ordered two rounds of drinks and as the night went on Brandon and my husband got into a discussion about bourbons/scotch (man talk) and Brandon even introduced us to a honey bourbon that was so smooth i even liked it! The manager on duty even came over and joined their discussion for a little bit, again i was super impressed by the by the way they interacted with customers.  The food again was very good, we ordered two appetizers, the steak nachos and calamari. We were very impressed with the steak nachos, plenty of steak, huge portion size it could have feed 3 people!  The calamari was OK there was just to many banana peppers for my liking, but the small pieces of calamari when i did find them were tasty. We probably wouldn't order again though. Because we were almost full from the apps, we only ordered one entree, the crab and shrimp alfredo. When I first received the dish, I didn't see the crab. Little did i know it was shredded within the dish and plentiful. It was fresh, not fishy at all and the shrimp were big and juicy, again not fishy. The hubby and I weren't to crazy about the cherry cream sauce but I think it is just a personal preference. The alfredo was not bad at all, just different but we probably would try something else next time.    I am super impressed by Baxter's (hubby as well) service (primarily) and food wise.  I can not wait to go back!  See you soon Baxter's!"}
{"text":"Ok. I personally looooove this place. We've been about 6x and my daughter who is very picky loves their burgers. The pan fried chicken is phenomenal!! I like wedge salad better than the spinach salad. But both are good. Great wine selection, ambiance and service. I had one time where I wasn't thrilled with service but I do believe they were busy and under staffed - I don't think it was an individual server fault. Try it! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Great place can't beat the steak nachos!!!! I know everyone on here says the same thing .... Service was great .... could have asked for better service been here twice and always enjoy what's on the menu"}
{"text":"This place tries to act very upscale, however I feel that this place is just a bar with bar food trying to hide behind some steaks that are on the menu. The bartenders are very slow as I watched numerous patrons wait entirely too long for their drinks. The lunch menu is, sorry to say it so bluntly, a JOKE. It's 2017. Take some of that played out crap off. Please. Not to mention that they are not wise enough to stay open late being the closest bar to a completely full hotel after a Garth brooks concert. Management could be a little more proactive with their employees rather than acting like you are better than everyone because you have a hominy based beer on tap. Simply put...amateur hour at this place. Luckily, I won't be back. I will mention this though...the bathrooms were very clean. That is about it."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times now. I like it. I like the food and the service has been good. I've had the tuna tartare, calamari, cheese and meat plate, French dip, and a pasta dish. The calamari comes with battered pepper rings which is weird, and I don't care for the Cajun flavor. It tastes burnt. But the mild is good. I'll be back again. Oh, and the butter cake!! Omg! Amazing!"}
{"text":"My past experiences at Baxter's has always been great! The food, the service, the ambience was delightful. Until Valentine's day, my food was just bleh!  My order was: 1. Steak Nachos: Yum! Wasn't too much cheese for the amount of chips it came with so they were still crunchy! 2. Baked Marinara & Herb Goat: I order this every time I come here and it never fails! The crostinis are crunchy so if you prefer softer bread then make sure you ask. The balance between the goat cheese and marinara was perfect. 3. Mussels: This app was on their special Valentine's Day menu. $15 for 4 mussels. I was not impressed. The cheese and mushrooms were overbearing, I didn't taste or feel any of the mussels. It was almost like they took the shells and filled it with cheese and shredded mushrooms... 4. Bistro Fried Chicken: I substituted the green beans for spinach. I took a bite of the spinach and immediately spit it out. It was SALTY and watery! Super watery that it reached the whole plate and touched the fried chicken and mashed potatoes. I was done with that dish. 5. Bacon Bourbon Filet: The filer mignon was dry, not much sauce. Garlic mashed potatoes were okay. Way too much Cajun onion strings on top of the filet.  6. White Peach Bellini: This cocktail was good! It's served over ice and a long ass straw, so it was kind of weird.. but it had a nice balance between the juice, peach schnapps, and prosecco!  Kameron was our server and he was very attentive! I was sad that my streak of good food at Baxter's has hit a rock. I'm pretty sure the kitchen was super busy since it was Valentine's Day. I will be back for more goat cheese and crostinis!!"}
{"text":"We had a really great dinner there as part of Champaign's Restaurant Week.  The food was great and the service was good.  We had some guests show up late and we had to ask the manager to get our server to begin ordering, but once the waiter came he was attentive and definitely made up for it.  I think they have a great wine selection and I really look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"First time visiting. Good place to have a dinner with your friends or precious one.  First of all, food quality is good and nice set out. We ordered fried calamari, shrimp cocktail, sirloin steak. Regarding sirloin, side was a little bit salty for me, but almost all of dishes were really tasteful.  Second, our server was so professional. Knowledgeable, friendly, often coming to ask, quick and polite. Other waiters were also polite. Regarding beer, there were a lot kinds of beer as well as wine list.  Third, price was really reasonable taking quality of dishes and restaurant atmosphere into consideration. We were 4 groups, shared 2 appetizers and ordered steak each. Drink some alcohol. Sprited price was $50 including 20% tips.  I hope to be back to this restaurant again when I visit Champaign, IL."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful meal at Baxter's yesterday.  Service, food drinks and amazing desserts were all excellent.   Salmon and prime rib mixed greens and soup of the day wonderful.   The yellow butter Carmel cake and chocolate flourless chocolate cake. Omg. Need I say more we really enjoyed it"}
{"text":"Great food and great service, nice ambiance for a client lunch"}
{"text":"The food wasn't bad. I felt it was a little pricey for what you got. We didn't get anything that I couldn't make at home. The meat was tender but the sauce in the crab cake was a bit off putting."}
{"text":"For this being a college town this place is very grown and good. If you are looking for semi-upscale place then this is it. Definitely if you are parent visiting your child in college this is the place to go out as a family. Also a great date night spot.   I was immediately impressed by the lay out and the outdoor patio with bar. They have good lighting so you won't feel like your eating in the dark. There is also a good mix of people here as well.   Service was professional and prompt. Jesse was our server and he was very friendly, gave honest recommendations for meals, and continued to follow up with us during the night. The manager even came by after the meal to ask how everything came out and if we needed anything. That to me is a sign of great staff/management.   The food was simply amazing! The tuna tartare was extremely fresh and had so much flavor. I ordered the salmon and it was grilled with dill sauce drizzled on top....WOW... My friend ordered the blackened red snapper which looked amazing and she couldn't stop raving about the flavor. She also ordered the soup of the day which they were all out of so they apologized and gave her a dessert on the house. That was a very nice of the manager.   The drinks and wine list is well put together with a lot of choices. I can't wait to visit the area again to try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"Best steak I have had in Champaign in years. I had a filet. Everything was very good, ambience was slightly upscale but casual. Service was pretty slow and bar was backed up but hoping they work out the kinks in the next couple months since it hasn't been open that long."}
{"text":"In town for the night and looking for nice place to eat.   This place was awesome.   From the Steak Nachos were devine.  My steak melted in my mouth.   I was not disappointed with my dessert either.   The Crem' Brûlée was out of this world."}
{"text":"Wonderful food! Wonderful Service! Wonderful wine selection! I read another review that said \"not cheap, but you get what you pay for\". True.  It's definitely pricy, but it's so worth it. I had the prime rib and it was out of this world.  I was blown away when I saw that they had Whispering Angel on their wine menu, as it's my FAVORITE wine and I hardly ever see it in restaurants.  It is more upscale and the tables are a little close together, but that's hardly reason to question coming here. Such a nice treat to eat here."}
{"text":"Standard American fare is offered at Baxter's - from steaks to pizza to salads - each with nuances that bring the dishes up a notch. The ambiance is dim but comfortable. Our waiter was nice, though my water glass was often empty. Maybe I guzzle water at an unnatural rate. For a weeknight, the place was full. The food was good based on how my entrée tasted & the public declarations of my dining companions. The location is on the cusp of a busy intersection but there is plenty of parking in an off-street lot. No bike parking spotted though. While the dinner menu is pricey, it is on par with fine dining restaurants downtown."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  Not only is the food great but the TIMING of everything was excellent.   Appetizers done...Out comes soups & salad.  That's done...out comes main courses.  Seems like a simple thing but amazingly it's not that common to get it just right   Service was attentive,  but not intrusive.  Price is above average for C-U, but I'm totally fine with that... if you get what you pay for.  And I was very impressed with Baxter's."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout while staying in a hotel next door.  Had the goat cheese appetizer and steak kabobs for dinner.  It was all very tasty.  The steak kabobs were cooked properly and super tender.  The goat cheese and marinara combo is delicious!"}
{"text":"Okay - first time here, nice ambiance, service was on point top to bottom - Alexis did an amazing job coordinating with the other staff members assisting her with our party of 16. I ordered an old fashion but am not sure what I actually got- I think I got an attempt at one. Wasn't horrible, the second one was the same so at least there was consistency there. I also ordered the 12 Oz ribeye med rare with green beans and mushrooms. When our entree came there were no mushrooms but Alexis took care of it super quick, it happens, no big deal. I will say though that my steak which I paid I think $23 for was overdone - like med well to well done. Had I been with just my wife I might have requested a do over. Being that we were with a group though I opted not to request a refire. The steak was super tough. Soasmuch as that it was hard to keep my plate from sliding around the table as I attempted to cut the dry piece of meat. SEASONING! Salt and pepper do wonders when steaks are thrown on the grill, I suggest they try it or be more liberal with it if they already wave it over the top. Two other individuals that got steaks in our party mentioned that theirs was way overcooked too. Evidently you have someone in the kitchen that needs some more training. We will probably give it another go but I doubt I will order beef there again, which is a shame."}
{"text":"Nice family friendly atmosphere and a variety of dishes to pick from. There is definitely something for everyone. The drunken mushrooms are very good and so is their fried chicken dish. The chicken itself is great, the gravy was a little on the salty side, and the green beans were bland but the chicken was awesome. Same experience with my girlfriend's dish.. steak was good but everything else was either too salty or too bland. Maybe we got an off day, but it'll be a while before I'm ever back here."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in Champaign-Urbana. I almost don't want to sing their praises, for fear of difficulty getting a table if they get too popular! Although this is a hotel restaurant, they are open to the public. With nice weather, there's live music outside. We chose to sit inside so we could chat. Our table liked everything we ordered, from the beet salad with salmon, to the salmon with asparagus, to the mixed drinks. Service was prompt and not too intrusive. Nice place for a fancy meal with a lot of different options on the menu."}
{"text":"Orderd Brazilian Steak Kabob and BBQ ribs. The kabob is the best I had in the US, the steak has the grilled taste and the beef is very juicy. BBQ ribs are also the best I had so far, has the feeling of the BBQ sauce along with the meat melting in your mouth. My favorite American grill restaurant now."}
{"text":"Service was excellent - wait staff as well as those who supported them were attentive and appeared to be alert and doing their best. The ambience was clean, quiet, warm. We ordered the jambalaya and the alfredo pasta with shrimp and crabmeat. Food came out alright. The jambalaya had an interesting flavor - it was spicy as expected but the flavor felt more acidic and tarty than salty and aromatic. The presentation of the dish was interesting - rice in the center and the jambalaya sauce with scallops, shrimps and peppers being placed around it Having been to many restaurants in the bigger cities, i think the flavor needs to be more savory and flavorful - with more depth. The alfredo bow tie shrimp dish was over creamy - but tasty. Could have included some greens to offset the rich taste and potentially some fried proscuitto for texture. The taste for this was stronger than the jambalaya dish. The alfredo bow tie could be presented instead of two pieces of toasted bread spread over the pasta. I would certainly give this restaurant another try in the future. There were a couple of sandwiches and dishes that were distinct to the restaurant that looked interesting. The meal for two was over thirty dollars, not including tips."}
{"text":"Stopped here for an early dinner on a long day of travel. Such a quiet, relaxing atmosphere! Soft music playing, lights dim, elegant atmosphere, great place to go for dinner with that special someone! The place for great food & great conversation! My husband had a pork chop with grilled Brussels sprouts and I had Brazilian steak kabobs with mixed fresh vegetables. Portions were generous; food was prepared with care & thought. Service was excellent! Drake was a great server! Highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for lunch. A great place to enjoy a relaxing lunch with friends. All the food I've had has been great."}
{"text":"This place is very nice, the waiter we had very polite, but the rating on here should be a 3 $ it's very expensive.  When I read American bad and grill I thought it wouldn't be as expensive as it was. Especially since it's near the college.  We did order the steak nachos and they where delicious. My recommendations is if you can afford to spend over $20 for an entree then go here. The burger was cheaper but there are burger places."}
{"text":"Excellent from the tuna Tatar to the Caesar salad and then the  jambalaya was off the hook"}
{"text":"I decided to try lamb for the first time and thankfully I tried it at Baxter's when they weren't busy.  That was among the most tender and flavorful meals I've ever eaten and the sides were just as expertly crafted as the main course.   I've been here twice. once they were jam packed because of a concert that was down the street, the other we were one of two parties to arrive early in the evening. I would avoid trying to steal a seat when they are jam packed, the speed and quality of service suffers a bit, and you don't want to miss out on the best this place can offer you.   I would highly recommend anyone to make a reservation early in the evening and try the Herb Crusted lamb chops with your preferred appetizer and side, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"This restaurant was a little hard to find. Located near the Hawthorne, this restaurant presents a fun, elegant and cozy environment. There are great lunch options along with cocktails if you do prefer. The lunch menu had a range of salads, burgers, sandwiches, pizzas and more traditional entrées (pricing ranging from 9 to 20+ bucks). Before our entrées came, our waitress brought up some freshly warmed rolls. These were delicious! I got the chicken melt which came on a pretzel bun and it also came with bacon and an aïoli. So good! It was generous and so tasty. The waitress was also really attentive and kind. Overall I had a great lunch experience here!"}
{"text":"We went for dinner on 6/11/17. Ordered calamari for our app. It was so salty we could barely eat it. I ad the mini-wedge, very good as was his soup. Husband had a ribeye and I a filet. Both steaks were good quality and perfectly cooked per our request. His mashed potatoes were good, but my baked appeared to have been cooked at the lunch hour. So old that skin was peeling off and inside was very hard and pasty. Seriously, it is not that hard to cook a potato. Service however, was excellent."}
{"text":"Very pleased with the service and food.  We had a pitcher of sangria for a very reasonable $15 on Saturday night, all the food was delicious.  Hope this place keeps the quality that we enjoyed tonight."}
{"text":"We were told it is a great place and we agree. We had the fried chicken and the steak apoivre. We had half of each meal to go so we'd be able to enjoy the Strawberry Shortcake Napoleon."}
{"text":"Overall, a nice upscale establishment with a nice meal and fairly decent price. However, you cannot pass off a butt steak as a rib-eye even if you smother it in mushroom sauce and serve it to a senior patron early on a Friday night! Have the ethics of the restaurant industry gone the way of business! Shame on you Baxters!! The mini-wedge salad was excellent, however and the seafood divine."}
