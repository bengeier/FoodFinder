{"text":"A decent bar but honestly the staff is a bunch of idiots. I use to come to this bar often but one night I lost my Id and most of the staff knows me one girl comes up and says no Id no beer and took my $6 beer away from me offering me no refund at all never coming here again."}
{"text":"This place wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything special, either. The food was decent - nothing fancy. I ordered the chicken sandwich that you can customize with any of the wing sauces. I like this idea, and my food was good, but just very basic (dry chicken breast with sauce, lettuce, tomato).  I liked the option of ordering my sandwich however I wanted. The beer list was great too and the staff was friendly, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend going to J&L Grill."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  I have been there several times and I have always had great food.  There Greek Salad, Mill Hunk and Turkey Burgers are my favorites.  The Tater Tot Hot Rivets (wrapped in bacon with jalape√±os) are good too.  

The beer selection is outstanding!  While I have had some slow service on occasion, I think they are getting better.  They really shouldn't have the wait staff have to make their shakes (which are also really good).  This really slows them down.

Bottom line, never had bad food and love the beer.  If you're in a hurry, just tell them that and they'll work it out."}
{"text":"I agree with Belly K, the restaurant was empty for good reason.  They need some serious help to get through their growing pains or they will certainly fail.  Food took forever to come out.  My friend had the burger with (not) melted gouda, can't remember the name, and it was made poorly and overpriced.  He was definitely unhappy.  

I made the mistake of special ordering the greek salad with blackened chicken..  I did not get blackened chicken, but did get blechen'd chicken.  I ate a small bite and then ate around the chicken, which I believe was bad.  The greek dressing, that I thankfully ordered on the side wasn't good.. In fact I think it was a vinaigrette, and the same one they use in their special sauce - they bring that with their burnt fries - which were also kind of dry and brown and flavorless. 

Normally I would chalk up a review like this to someone picky or a whiner, but I bite my tongue normally, when the food is mediocre, but it doesn't deserve a mediocre label... at all. 

I went on Yelp while I was there, and of course, the reviews were not good.  When the bartender asked if everything was ok, I said more or less.  I recommended he have suggestion cards for customers to fill out to get a more honest review, then read one of the Yelp reviews to him.  He didn't seem too surprised and was happy to look up Yelp to read some reviews himself.  


Why didn't I read it before I went?  I'm just not that picky.  I use Yelp to find phone numbers, addresses and get reviews on nightlife, not to read or write reviews on restaurants. 

But I feel I would not be acting responsibly if I did not warn potential customers.  Let them go through the growing pains.. Fire the chef, divide the place in half until football season so it doesn't look empty. 

 I'm not even going to mention the waitstaff because I truly believe that is a management and training issue, not the fault of those working there.  They probably had no training or guidance and they won't get much experience working for an empty joint like this. 

I must mention the special sauce again.. I think it was raspberry vinaigrette and honey mustard.. I may be missing one ingredient, but not too far off.  

While I was thinking it, my friend said it, \"This is the kind of restaurant that rich mommy and daddy paid for for one of their kids that had a 'great idea!', but have no idea how to run a restaurant.  They paid for all the bells and whistles and thought that would automatically bring the people.  I wish them luck.

So it's not all negative I will say that the bartender was nice and the manager or owner walked up to us before the end of the meal to ask if everything was OK, which I replied with a shrug. 

Well,  they know about Yelp now, so they'll get some honest feedback and hopefully make the changes that will get people there.  I wish them all the best as I know how tough it is to pay overhead while your business is empty and struggling.

{"text":"Got the smoked Bleu burger? Not 100% on the name. Either way my burger was pretty much tasteless and 12 dollars. Was also insanely greasy my bun was sopping wet. Fries looked bad but ended up being really good. A little crispy and looked fresh cut. My gf got a regular cheese burger which she said was good. Huge bottle selection, I wanna say around 80? And around 14 drafts. I love trying new beers so huge plus. Thought the place looked really nice inside on par with the rest of southside works. Was the only people inside as well except for what I believed to be the owner/manger and his wife and infant. He was nice enough and curious about us and the area although he seemed a bit out of his element. I work in restaurants so it's easy to read between the lines when I go out to eat. Would have reviewed lower due to bad food, expensiveness, and overall emptiness but service was good/ and friendly great beer list as well and very expensive look to the place. If their kitchen could put out some much higher quality food could maybe have something. Although southside is really about who can either be cheap or trendy why do you think jacks is always packed. O yeah they also make spiked milk shakes. Didn't order but sounds fun."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place hearing about their extensive beer selection, customizable burgers, and various wing sauces. From the moment I sat down I was disappointed. On a slow Saturday afternoon it took our waitress 10 minutes to even acknowledge our table for water. And a total of 45 minutes before we were able to get our orders in. We would have flagged her down but she was no where to be seen and returned stinking of cigarette smoke so noticeable several in our party mentioned it afterwards. 

When we had two additional people join our party, family who just happened to have walked in our waitress was cold and unhelpful, basically ignoring the two before we had to grab a manager to get their drink orders placed. 

The burger I have to admit was good but something about a soggy disintegrating bun turns off my appetite. The 'homemade' chips were insanely over seasoned and too salty to bear. I'll try here again one more time and see if I just had a bad waitress and caught the cook on a bad day."}
{"text":"My office is right by J&L Grill so I watched the construction with great anticipation. Yes! A new lunch/happy hour spot. Unfortunately it looks like I'm going to have to keep searching for a \"close to the office gem.\" 

A friend and I stopped in on a Wednesday night for dinner. Though the restaurant was nearly empty the service was still somehow very slow. There were 2 other people sitting at the bar and we still had to flag down the bar tender to try and get a drink or place our order. I think the best way to describe the atmosphere of the restaurant is cold. Yes, its shiny and new and there are plenty of televisions, but its more sterile than inviting. 

During happy hour they offer $.25 wings and $2 domestic drafts; that's exactly what we had. The wings were \"meh\". They were small and tasty enough, but they weren't anything special. We tried the \"Brush Fire\" (buffalo ranch), the \"Bayou Cajun\" and the \"Medium Buffalo\". The \"Brush Fire\" was fine but the other two much closer to bad than good. Looking over the rest of their menu I noticed that the prices are all quite high considering fries must be purchased on the side. Most sandwiches and burgers are $10, fries are $2.75 and an average beer is $3-5. You're looking at $20 for a burger, fries, beer, and tip, that's rather steep if you ask me."}
{"text":"You know a place didn't stand out too much when it's in your Yelp queue to write a review about and you can't remember what the place was until you look up images of the place.

This place was just as the review of 2 stars says. Meh. The design of the place seems oddly cheap and thrown together. The food was okay but a bit overpriced for what it was. We ordered a spiked milkshake and the thing MIGHT have had alcohol in it, but you could've fooled me. For the price, I'd rather go elsewhere."}
{"text":"We stopped in yesterday around 4:30pm for a drink and burger.  The place was huge and very clean.  At that time of day it was empty so we got seated and service immediately.   The Bird and I decided to share a Yinzer burger.  10 oz burger with ham, bacon, and of course a fried egg! It was excellent!  We are both excited that a quality burger place has located within 6 miles of our place.  I'd put J&L Grill in the same category as BrGr.

Can't wait to try their spiked milkshakes and wings the next visit.

PS. with 14 flat screens I see some Penn State gems being watched here!"}
{"text":"I cannot say anything too horrible about J & L, but there is also nothing to write home about either.  

The service was super friendly and good, but everything else was just a meh, nothing great experience.  The food was not good and we really could not figure out the vibe that they are trying to go with (I am thinking maybe sports bar since they do have a lot of TV's?  I do not know).  

We want to like this place as we live so close still, but with so many other options and nothing really standing out, it makes it hard.  They apparently have karaoke on Friday nights, but so do so many other places in the area.  They do have an all you can eat wing night which I am sure will be a draw for some.  

I think if the food improves, it has so much potential."}
{"text":"Not sure why everyone seems so down on this place.  I'll concede that its nothing special but the food is good, service was acceptable and decor was clean and modern.

I went to J & L while visiting my brother and his friends on a weekend.  We had a party of 8 and made reservations but we definitely did not need them.  Hostess seated us quickly and our server arrived very quickly.  She was friendly and joked around with all of us as she took our drink orders.  Took a little longer than one would expect with such an empty establishment but nothing that aggravated me.  

We all ordered some sort of appetizer and a burger.  I personally got the tater tot Hot Rivets which were tater tots surrounded by jalapeno and cheddar then wrapped in bacon and skewered with a toothpick.  The portion was larger than I had expected for the $5 price but I was happy about that.  They were very tasty but the tater tot had gotten soggy from the toppings.  I would try the pretzel nugget version next time for some more texture.  I tasted a wing which was OK and an onion ring which was very good.  I ordered a Smoky City burger for my entree which is a burger topped with smoked Gouda cheese, bacon and sauteed onions tossed in a Worcestershire mustard sauce.  It was enormous as were all the other burgers.  The barbecue sauce was good but it could have used a little more.  Onions were a little undercooked but not bad.  Burger came with fries for a $1 up-charge which was worth it.  Fries were fresh cut and well seasoned.

All in all, I'd say J&L isn't a must visit but is a good choice if you're looking for some \"better than barfood\" in the Southside area."}
{"text":"My team and I dined here last Friday for lunch to celebrate Boss's Day. Several people had eaten here once or twice before, while it was the first visit for several others (including myself).

For its convenience to a lot of office buildings, I was surprised by how empty the restaurant was at lunchtime. A co-worker of mine had called ahead, and a table was already set up for the nine of us, which was very nice. Our waiter had a fun and quirky personality. Of course, a group of nine women had a lot of questions about the menu, which he did an adequate job of answering. He wasn't extremely detailed in his descriptions but had a strong opinion which I liked.

After ordering, we chatted... and chatted... and chatted. I believe we all enjoyed ourselves, but the food took forever to come out. Yes, we were a larger group, but most of us ordered salads, sandwiches, or flat bread. We arrived a few minutes before noon and did not finish lunch until 1:30. Since we didn't take very long to eat, I'm pretty sure that we must've waited on the food for an hour.

I ordered the Margarita flatbread, which was very tasty. I also tried a few of the Russet Potato Fries that a co-worker ordered which were amazing. My boss ordered a salad (I believe the Margarita?) that looked very petite for the price. It looked more like a side salad than an actual meal. One of the \"highlights\" of the salad was mozzarella cheese, which she said was actually just cheap slices instead of fresh. If I had personally ordered that salad, this restaurant would definitely not be fortunate enough to receive three stars from me...

I have several suggestions for the owners/managers of J&L. (1) Improve the speed of your lunch preparation, making sure that patrons receive their lunch within 20-30 minutes. (2) After improving your speed, heavily market yourself to the local office buildings. Placing signs outside the buildings pointing in the direction of your restaurant and offering 10-20% off meals would be a great start. (3) Add your lunch specials menu to your website. The majority of my party ordered from the menu, yet it is not online. (And your website still says \"Official Website Coming Soon,\" which is pretty pathetic for a restaurant open for this long.) I would also consider calling ahead and ordering lunch specials if they were listed online.

This OK restaurant really has the potential to become good or great. Hopefully, they are able to improve quickly enough before the South Side Works employees are tired of giving them a second chance."}
{"text":"I was very impressed when I stopped in Pittsburgh to see an old friend and we met here.

Great specials on food and beer $2 Coors light drafts!  The burger was about as tasty as they come with lots of topping choices.

Swank restaurant/bar that could easily become a club at night if they chose.  Also they have the slickest/newest mytouchtunes machine I've ever seen.  You can control the music from your phone which is awesome."}
{"text":"We used to live about 2 minutes walking distance away from J & L...and only went a few times. For people that eat out way too much, it says a lot when we avoid a local spot.

Even in a place that seems mostly empty every time that I was in there, you'll be hard-pressed for good service at J & L. I've only had one good experience with the waitstaff. During the rest of my visits, I experienced waitstaff with no enthusiasm for their jobs or the product, and very little personality. The last time my wife and I went, our waitress disappeared for long periods of time. We didn't see her waiting on anyone else...she would just disappear. Then it took forever to get our check. Unless she was doubling as the chef, there's no excuse for not checking in on your table and at least giving us refills on our waters. This particular waitress pretty much snubbed my wife when she said no to a second beer. It was a very odd interaction.

So, the service is bad...that's fine, as long as the food is exceptional, right? Well, again, J & L misses the mark. I've tried quite a few things on the menu. Apps, pizza, wings and sandwiches. The deep-fried apps were always undercooked. Cold cheese sticks, soggy fries, soggy, awful \"hot rivets\" (and the rivets are one of their signature apps). We even had onion rings with uncooked batter. The only positive is that at least they seem to bread the onion rings in-house. Overall, just a total disappointment from what could be a really good bar menu from the looks of it. I also wish they would've had boneless wings. I guess they only have those during happy hour. These days, it seems odd to not have the option to go boneless.

The two reasons worth giving it a try, or why I still consider it an option are a) the milkshakes, and b) NFL Sunday Ticket. I got a simple vanilla milkshake during one of my visits and it was really good. It seemed to take forever, but I was happy after tasting it! For watching games, it's not a bad spot. There are tons of TV's - albeit placed a little too high and only around the edges of the restaurant - but they're quality TV's and they have Sunday Ticket if your'e looking for a game.

J & L is a nice, huge space with tons of potential. With some better waitstaff and some better cooks in the kitchen, J & L could be a great place. Of course, that could be said for nearly every subpar restaurant. I really hope it improves, because on a street with countless bars serving bar-quality food and Sunday Ticket, a little extra pride is the only thing that will keep J & L afloat."}
{"text":"Came in with my fianc√© to meet up with a couple friends for sunday lunch.  Beautiful Sunday after noon about 1 and we walked in and were the only people there.  It was a cool looking place with tons of staff walking around so, we sat at the bar for a beverage while we waited for friends and took several minuets for a bartender to get around to us for some drinks.  Not he best start.
Friends arrived and we placed our order.  I ordered a Gringo Burger.  The burger looked good from the outside but fell short on taste.  I opened up the burger to take a look at it and came to realized the for got an ingredient on it (the avocado slices).  I told the server and he went back into the kitchen and grabbed 3 tiny slices of avocado.  For an $11 dollar burger i was expecting a little more.  The burger patty it's self had no taste what so ever.  Maybe a little salt and pepper added to the meat prior to cooking would be nice.  Also, the mac and cheese was OK but was expecting some more flavor when it boasts a bacon and Jalape√±o flavor.  Didn't see or taste the Jalape√±o.    
As for the rest of our order a couple minor things but a big one as in they totally forgot to place an order all together and when they finally brought it out they for got to put an ingredient on that burgers as well (the BBQ sauce on the Yinzer).  
so summery was over priced, poor service and crapy food that wasn't properly made.  all in all horrible.
Enjoy"}
{"text":"This place is decidedly average. The food was ok as was the service. The food took a bit too long for a simple order in an almost completely empty restaurant. I don't think this place will still be in business six months from now. I had the little bacon jalapeno mac and cheese and wings. The portion was very small and the mac and cheese wasn't the best nor the worst. The wings were average. I wish I could say more about the place but it's just average. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"J & L Grill has a bit of a ways to go to get things running smoothly.  The space is very modern and comfortable, and they have outdoor seating as well.  Location is great, right on Carson Street with convenient parking garage access in the Southside Works.  We were seated promptly, and that's where things slowed down.  It took quite a bit of time for the waiter to take our drink orders, so much so that we had ample time to peruse the menu offerings, chat, and then consider leaving as we realized this might not fit into our lunch hour.

The waiter came over to take our orders.  I opted for the cold cucumber soup ($4) and a homemade veggie burger ($10).  I was disappointed to hear that for that price, the veggie burger did not come with anything else, just the burger.  We decided to order sweet potato fries ($3) for the table.  

Shortly after, the waiter returned to tell us that the soup of the day had changed.  It was now tomato bisque.  I decided to take the soup off my order, as it was about a hundred degrees outside, and I wasn't in the mood for hot soup.  Not a minute later, the chef came to our table to tell us he could accommodate the original soup order.  Not sure what that was all about.

The soup arrived to the table.  It was perfect for a hot summer day, refreshing and tasty.  But then, things slowed down again.  It took another 15 mins after we finished for the rest of the food to arrive.  The sweet potato fries were soggy, and didn't hold up to dipping them in ketchup.  The veggie burger seemed similar to a falafel consistency, however it was overcooked and blackened on one side.  It was supposed to come with lettuce, onion, tomato and avocado.  In actuality, there was a pile of spring mix, and a small amount of avocado paste; no tomato, no onion.  The roll had been toasted to the point of being way too hard.  In addition to having to ask for the proper toppings, we had to ask repeatedly for refills on our drinks.

Midway through picking apart the food for the edible parts, one of the owners came out to talk to us.  We were happy to engage her in polite conversation about our experience, as this location is near our office and we were hopeful that it would be a new lunch option, particularly for clients and visitors.  She offered to remake the veggie burger.  At that point, having looked around at other tables' food, I declined.  She did not make an offer to discount the bill (not that it is expected, but would have been a nice gesture considering most of the food was untouched and clearly inedible).  We mentioned that the price seemed really high for the burgers and sandwiches to not come with a side.  Her reply was that the sandwiches are really large.  My sandwich certainly wasn't large, and looking around, the burgers weren't either.  We also mentioned that we thought the lunch should fit within the hour, as we were going on an hour and 15 mins for cold soup and a simple grilled veggie burger.  She said that they are more set up for a dinner service but within the year, they are looking to add a faster lunch option. 

She also let us know about their happy hour, which is $2 domestic bottles and 25 cent wings.  

After she thanked us for the feedback, we finished up.  We had to ask for the check, and wait quite awhile for them to return to pick up our payment.  (Which came to a startling $50 for 3 people for a lunch of sandwiches and soup, and one plate of fries).  From the time we came in the door, to the time we left, the total visit was an hour and a half.

My takeaway:  With several well known chains known for quality and value right nearby, and many popular independent restaurant options along busy Carson Street, the J & L Grill is going to need to do something to stand out from the competition.  Cheap wings and beer will get patrons in the door, but the menu is too overpriced to stay for anything else."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and I think the consensus is that J&L has a long way to go. I think people need to go easy on them. They are new to South Side and they didn't come out of the gates swinging. They need some time to work things out.

They have a lot of potential. I think their food is pretty good and they have a decent selection of beer but something is missing. I feel the place it too big. It's just a big room with tables and a bar, I feel there is nothing to break up of the place. Why not a pool table or darts or even a wall or two. When you are there you can see every table in the place which is a little odd. 

They are beginning to earn a reputation for taking too long to deliver during lunch which is a big deal to the surrounding business like AE Headquarters. If you can't get in and out in under an hour it's too long. 

Overall I like it. I think if they care about their business and make changes as they grow they will be successful."}
