{"text":"Was glad to be seated even though I didn't have a reservation. I think the fact that typically you can't get in this place without one speaks for itself. Ordered the mushroom app and was not disappointed in the least. Duck confit was perfect and the creme brûlée was the cherry on top. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Unfortunately we have to cross Brussel's Bistro off our list. Once or twice a year we dine at Brussel's for a \"finer\" dining meal. I reserved a table for 2 at Brussel's for my wife's birthday dinner. Although the waiter and chef may have recognized us as \"regulars\", here's what happened: 8:00 reservation  8.25- finally seated 8.40-the waiter asked what we wanted, he couldn't take our order because he forgot his notepad. 8.55-waiter returns to take our order of 2 drinks and 2 crab cakes, and tells us that the salmon and lamb mains were no longer available -- no problem 9.10-waiter returns with our drinks 9.25-waiter returns with 1 crabcake, they had run out but no other patrons had ordered since our arrival (all were seated and served by the time we got our table) and the waiter never bothered to ask if one of us would like something else. We then both ordered the Bouillabaisse for our main course and only THEN -- after we've been at the restaurant for nearly an hour and a half and had yet to be served a morsel  -- does he inform us they are also out of Bouillabaisse! Why didn't he tell us before?  At no time were we offered water or bread. The night was ruined. My wife stormed out of the restaurant while I approached the chef, who is also the owner. I told him what had happened and how disappointed we were about the lack of menu items and our long wait -- he did not say one word?!? Clearly this faux fine dining establishment cares most about making as much money as possible and zero about customer service. We will never be back."}
{"text":"a table of 6 was just shy of 2 1/2 hours for 2 courses. 'The food is coming...'. when it came, the warm brie was almost frozen on top of the salad which tasted like it just came out of a  box/plastic aftertaste. Charcuterie plate? a Plate covered with sandwich meat i purchase from Royal Beef. no mustard/pickle or accompaniment. 3 had Moules Ostendaise, not consistent  level of mustard added different in each. Ditto for Moules Pastis, one had Pernod one did not. Bread was nice. Service aloof and unapologetic for time. 1 hour between courses. ouch"}
{"text":"So thankful this place is in The Beaches as quality restaurants simply don't exsist in the beach village. The Mr and I always order the Brussels salad - goats cheese, blue berries, walnuts - It's delicious. The duck is also very nice but I prefer to order mussels (any of them) because I think it's what they do best. The chocolate pate is to die for. Don't even bother trying any other dessert - chocolate pate all the way. The only issue with this place is they never have Veuve Cliquot stocked. Perhaps we've just been unlucky but it;s always a bummer.  Eat here, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"This review is for brunch.  I saw some wonky dinner reviews but brunch here with my parents, sister, et al was great!  Everything was incredible, the waffles, pancakes, oh and the eggs were done perfectly.  Chocolate croissants were amazing, we had a terrific time."}
{"text":"Oh deary me, one too many wines at the balmy beach club.....going to be late, two thumbs down(due to us).  Greeted by  a wonderful hostess you understands the Friday afternoon drunk. Two thumbs up!  The pre super bread was delish, two thumbs up,   We decided to share the crab cakes and lobster bisque, I was unmoved by the crab cakes ( but they weren't bad, just average for crab cakes). One thumb up, one thumbs down :p  So, the main coarse arrives dah dah dah, Atlantic halibut and Ontario rabbit (yes you read that right!). Both are served with saluted veggies and delightful frites, delicious Two thumbs up! A tad dry, but that's rabbit for you :)   We've been here a few times, consistently great and always clean, friendly and relaxed.  Really is a beach gem. We will continue to frequent. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Brussels is a rare find in the Beaches - amazing food, ambience and a distinct type of restaurant.   The Beaches has a lot of fast food and ok restaurants. Brussels provides amazing French Belgian cuisine and wine. The owner/chef is committed to providing great food and interesting takes on this school of food.   Set in a renovated house, the restaurant has a warm yet refined feel to it.   We live in the Beaches and try to go at least once a month to support great food out here."}
{"text":"There are two postings for this restaurant. Seems to be hit or miss. We really liked it. Personality on the waiter and the host! Helpful advice for ordering.   The food was good, not great. The service was quick, helpful, and stayed invisible when they should.   We would have given three and a half stars but, that's not a choice.   Worth a try for sure."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for New Year's Eve - what a huge mistake.  From the minute we walked in the reception was cold. Terrible service, mediocre food. We had to ask for our bill after the appetizers finally arrived two hours later. We wanted out, this was the last place we wanted to be to ring in the new year.  We asked if there was a problem, they shrugged at us. Too bad as we like to support our local businesses. Complimentary bottle of wine was too little too late. Kelly and Casey"}
{"text":"Our family was visiting Toronto on a short trip and came across this bistro for brunch on Sunday. We have a two year old as well and despite the very fancy layout the restaurant was exceptionally accommodating   The good was good with rather large portions. Atmosphere was nice with good music to set the mood. The wait staff was professional, accommodating and were very generous to our party of five and took extra care of our daughter's desires.   A great experience that wasn't planned."}
{"text":"I went On November 17th, 2013. The place is gorgeous, service is excellent, the food not meeting the expectation of a Belgian ! French Fries are not like the one that you will find in Belgium! That's the first thing that a Belgian should know how to do and I'm sorry this place doesn't know how to do real Belgian's French fries. Snails are good."}
{"text":"Confit d'ail, bisque de homard, moules-frites...we couldn't possibly be in the Beaches, could we?"}
{"text":"The Beaches is short on places to eat on a real celebration night -- there's gotta be something better than the Keg -- and this is one of them. Very cheery atmosphere with lots of beautiful Belgian posters, great lighting and comfortable chairs and tables. The food is excellent. The beers, as might be expected in an authentic Belgian place, are toprate--this is what craft beer makers in Canada need to aim for. The service is friendly and just the right amount of attentiveness.The chef seems to be doing his best to source locally as his Belgian menu allows, which I like to see. Wayne r"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner with a dear friend and my mother here on Wednesday night. Although the address of this place is 'Queen Street,' the restaurant is technically on a side street so make sure you don't miss it. Brussels Bistro is in what used to be a home; the decor is very intimate and cozy. Upon entering, you feel like you're going to have a nice dinner at a friend's home. The menu is extensive, but not too overwhelming that you can't decide. As an appetizer, we ordered the Confit d'Ail - the garlic with the cheese was a nice treat. It wasn't too garlic heavy, which was nice. I was in the mood for mussels so I decided to go with it - there are about 10 different types of mussel flavors. My dining companions ordered the Diable and I had the Saffron. Both were winners. Dipping the bread with the broth ... yum, yum, yum. For dessert, I had the special of the day - pecan tart. Let me warn you, desserts here are pretty big so if you're on a diet, either pass on it or share. Anyway, I really enjoyed my dining experience here; I can't wait to return to check out their Brunch.  Good for: mussels, dinner, celebrations"}
{"text":"We have tried to love this place. And on occasion we have. But the attitude doesn't match the price. The last time we were there, I was served the cheese platter with nuts, although I'd told them I had a serious allergy. Their solution? represent the same food with some of the cheese cut away that might have come in contact with the nuts and rewashed the same plate. No real apology. No sense that maybe this wasn't a shining moment for them in customer service. The bouillabaisse is great. Other dishes like the lamb? You could do better elsewhere. Not sure that we'll keep trying. The last time was so disappointing."}
{"text":"The food was very good, service was exceptionally \"French.\" The server was not a personality, just there to convey the menus and food to the table. I'd have appreciated at least a smidge of personality. The music (in the upstairs area) was a bit loud, as is the room echoey, so if you're looking for intimacy, be sure to ask for a downstairs table vs upstairs. Downstairs allows for greater intimacy/quiet conversation, but the upstairs area lends itself better to a party/enthusiastic vibe. The menu is small, but the selections are well-balanced. The humpback shrimp is not really much of an appetizer, just a fancy name for small prawns and they're not at all large, nor are they unique. The soups are terrific. I had the steak, my wife had the lamb, and we exchanged a lot of food. Both were wonderful. Looking forward to returning, but will sit downstairs next time."}
{"text":"This was a great special occasion choice for the Beaches. The menu is very Belgian, and my choices were divine: lobster bisque and fois gras a poele. The poster art, which includes some originals our server said, is great for the atmosphere. The upstairs is good for a night out with loud friends and downstairs is best for an intimate affair. We will definitely be returning!"}
