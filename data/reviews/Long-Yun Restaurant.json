{"text":"When you're driving along the highway in Ohio and you see a large yurt by the side of the road, you really need to stop and check it out.  I don't know who's idea it was to design this place in the fashion of a Mongolian dwelling, but it certainly does catch the eye.

Long-Yun is a very typical Northeast Ohio style Chinese buffet.  It has the usual steam tables of semi-Asian style items, along side American standards - the sesame chicken is next to a tray of french fries and other odd juxtapositions. All of that fare is unexceptionally okay; its salty and greasy and tastes fine, but it's certainly not authentic Chinese.

What Long-Yun offers that is different from most Chinese buffets here, is the Mongolian BBQ - the giant flat grill on which they cook your self-concocted combination of meat, vegetables and sauces.  Given that this place is AYCE, the combination of the buffet and the BBQ makes it a real deal.

I have no qualms recommending this place. It may not be the right fit for a foodie, but it's extraordinarily okay; it's a good deal for the price; and it's in a freakin yurt in Macedonia OH.  How can you pass up that experience?"}
{"text":"Large buffet. Asian foods are well-prepared but not necessarily stand-outs, i.e. they are sound but not exceptional. Dishes prepared to order at the Mongolian-style stir-fry table are the best options here. American dishes (pizza, fried shrimp, etc) are so-so---good enough for kids and nondiscriminating adults, but not what you'd come here for. Salads are fresh. Buffet is well-attended by staff. Large, attractive seating area. Worth a try if you like Asian buffets."}
{"text":"The Yurt wasn't designed for this current incarnation. It once housed a very good Amish food style restaurant.

Now for the short run on the Long Yun

Overpriced vaguely Chinese food that's been sitting under the lamps too long. If you like dried food, constantly asking when offerings will be replenished, and being watched like a hawk then by all means pull in to The Yurt."}
{"text":"My husband and I agree that this is hands down the worst Chinese buffet we have ever experienced (and we are huge Chinese buffet fans). We each tried every dish that looked remotely appealing and there was only one thing (the crab rangoon) that I could bring myself to eat after the first bite. Even the mozzarella sticks were god awful (how do you mess up mozzarella sticks!?).

However, the Mongolian BBQ is good and more than makes up for the paucity of acceptable buffet food. They don't have the hugest selection of stuff for the mongolian BBQ, but it is totally serviceable, quite delicious, and the price is right. The sushi is also totally acceptable, though they serve a limited selection that is rarely replenished (they did not bring more sushi out the entire time we were there).

REVISION: We went back two more times and the buffet was MUCH better - so I guess it's just hit or miss. My suggestion is to go at a time that is pretty crowded (like dinner on a Saturday) so the food turns over and is replaced quickly."}
{"text":"It's your typical Chinese buffet and although I've had better, I have no complaints here.  The service is good and they have a variety of \"American\" fare for those that are not into Chinese.  Great for the kids.  My boys love the variety of fruit and fresh vegi's."}
{"text":"When I think of Mongolian Barbecue, I think of my days in California. Back there, they have Mongolian Barbecue yurts on damn near every street corner and you go in, take off your shoes and possibly your shirt and rip into a yak or similar beast that had been pit-roasted for days.

Well, they do things differently in Macedonia. Gone is the giant roasted animal in the middle of the room. Gone are the grunting tribesmen and their Scandanavian trophy wives. Gone is the pay as you go soda fountain. Here, you sit at a table and you eat Chinese food. Or sushi.

And what a difference it makes. The buffet is nice even though people wipe their hands on things and mix and match serving spoons. I grab a gob of this and a gob of that and eat it quickly with my dirty hands. 

In Mongolia people eat with their hands like a piece of meat is akin to a sandwich so, go for it. Live it up, Macedonians. Cast your chopsticks and forks to the floor and grab you a fist full of the stuff. Squeeze your fist and the food will ooze out of the top like Senor Wences and Johnny doing a bit on eating disorders. Eat it like it don't matter.

Like it don't matter at all. I tip well here because I feel sorry for the people who work here who might wish they were in a another country or California."}
