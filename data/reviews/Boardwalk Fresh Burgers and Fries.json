{"text":"No. No. I made this account just to write this and how horrible my experience with Boardwalk. When this first opened up, the prices were reasonable with the amount and quality of food. The burgers tasted alright but a bit overpriced. The poutine and their varieties were served with huge amounts and the fries were very good. But now they decreased their quantities by over 50% while keeping their original price which is $6.49. I bought one today since I haven't been there for a very long time and I was surprised on how much Boardwalk horribly changed. The prices went up and the quantities greatly decreased. It is way too overpriced for the very small quantity. The quality is just average. Guess they are just milking their profits now. Never coming back here anymore and of course, I'll be warning my friends."}
{"text":"I tried somewhere new for dinner tonight. The Boardwalk on the corner of Heritage and Acadia. First experience is not a good one....granted they were busy and there was only two people.. One cooking one making the milkshakes and taking cash. With Help Wanted signs on their window they seemed to be ok.  Now they took my order (chocolate milkshake, garlic Parmesan fries and a truffle burger. ) came close to 20.00.  So besides the brutal expensive cost, they made my milkshake right away and left it on the counter not calling my number... That wouldn't have bothered me if they didnt take 35 MINS to cook my food. Now... Yes they are very short staffed... But at least they could have called my number so I got my milkshake.... But no it sat there. Now I got my meal and i had to search for my milkshake as my food was not put with it.  I got it home and opened it all up the burger looked weak the fries are ok... And the shake was good But NO whip Cream on it and no cherry?!? I didn't know it came with that but for the price I paid... It was to much. I wouldn't recommend this location, hopefully others around town are MUCH better than this one."}
{"text":"I tried Boardwalk because it's not far from home and a new burger joint I'd never heard of sounded interesting. I've now gone several times, I started with the build a burger, which was fine and exactly as I ordered, but the real treat was the Chipotle specialty burger (get a double if you're really hungry - but the single usually does me fine if I'm also getting fries - careful on their portions - the large is good for 3 people) for an even spicier kick, add jalapenos to your chipotle burger. Definitely my favorite burger there. I once had the poutine - it was generous in size but the gravy was just ok - for Calgary I'd say it was above average. Their crisp fries stand up to the gravy well. No soggy boggy fries.   Speaking of soggy - they use what I think are egg buns - which hold up alot better than regular buns - if you eat in it will never be a problem - but when you take out, and your burger is all steamy in the bag, the bun shouldnt fall apart and get soaked like most buns. It's this attention to detail that I really like. The chocolate milkshake comes topped with a cherry and whipped cream and is super decadent. My biggest complaint about this place is a very nit-picky one - they dont have onion rings and I think if they did - they'd know how to do them right."}
{"text":"I found Boardwalk using my Nearby Button on a night when I didn't want to cook. The couple reviews so far made the place sound pretty good.  Walked into a clean but generic looking restaurant. The staff were friendly and we placed out orders, then received a marker number for our table, so our food could be brought to us. I had the veggie burger. I liked that it was not a soy based product but a spicy bean pattie. My mom had the grilled chicken burger. My veggie burger looked exactly like something from a package bought at the grocery store. It had mild Indian -esque flavour but was dry. The bun was light and fluffy, but the sad tomato, smear of sauce and  scrap of iceberg lettuce didn't do much to perk things up. I would put the serving size under the category of small.  My mom's chicken burger had the same disappointing toppings but the chicken portion was substantial, the biter pretty moist.  The website talks up the fries being fresh and cooked in peanut oil.  One half of our fries were soggy, the other crunchy. Definitely not fresh. I can't say that I'd be back, seeing as their are a ton of other burger options around."}
{"text":"This place and location is really good to go to if you love burgers, friendly service and reasonable prices. The employees are really nice, I definitely feel welcome when I'm here. I also LOVE their milkshakes, definitely a need to get item on the menu (I recommend the cookies & cream). I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I would have had a better experience cooking up my own frozen Walmart generic brand beef patties and a bag of frozen shoestring fries. My wife had the jalapeno chedder fries, the chedder was a runny processed cheese substance, which we thought was the cause for the soggy fries, however I had ordered the garlic parmesan and although the topping was relatively dry the fries to were soggy. My wife had the truffle burger, it did not taste like truffle, cheese was nonexistant, a couple slices of mushrooms under a dry tasteless patty. I had the turkey avacado, the patty was slightly less dry than my wifes, lacked flavor, missing the cheese, with a smear of gucamole, the most unfortunate was the two loonie sized slices of tomato, apparently they dont waste the tomato ends. We both had shakes, they were subpar, no whip cream or cherry on top. The service was ok, definiatly understaffed. We didnt finish our food and picked up a couple of burritos from the taco time behind. Dont waste your money here. Such a dissapointing experience."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here with husband and 2 kids.  Little pricey. Had the BBQ bacon cheddar burger, the BBQ sauce tasted weird.  Burger was good.  Also had the bacon cheddar ranch fries, the cheese sauce was cold which was gross.  Milk shake was great, the only highlight. As for the restaurant tables were dirty which I assume is from the night before as the place just opened at 11am when we got there.  No change tables in either bathroom, because changing a baby on the floor is a joy.  Would not go back."}
{"text":"Wow, its been awhile since I have been this annoyed with a food joint in this city.  Today we picked up a bacon cheese burger, chicken sandwich, a basket of garlic cheese fries and 2 drinks.  When we arrived home we found the chicken burger was uneatable, must have been badly freezer burnt as it was so tough it couldn't be chewed through. The tomatoes on both we so mushy they made me gag, I had to remove them from the burger to finish it.  The $6.50 order of garlic parm fries which is normally a huge order had about 20 french fries in the huge Styrofoam container, it was seriously less than a 1/4 full.  To top it off my wife's gingerale was totally flat, we dumped it down the sink.   I can only remember 1 or 2 times previous in my life I had take out so bad that I felt the need to call.  On the phone I asked for a manger to which there was no one available.  I discussed my situation politely and calmly to the staff member to which they replied  \"Im very sorry sir, I will forward your message to a manager..... and then they hung up before I could even say another word.  Well its been a slice Boardwalk, never eating at your joke of an establishment again."}
{"text":"Awful!  I'm adding review for my husband. He eats out daily and very very seldom does he find the need to share what or where he ate lunch but today was bad!  He went to Boardwalk burgers for the first time and ordered their avocado bacon burger with chilli cheese fries.  He said he waited at least 20 minutes (but thought well they must be making it fresh and that's great!) however his anticipation was deflated quickly when he finally got his meal.  Fries were so wet that the paper was shredded and sticking to the watery cheese. The burger was an ordinary burger and completely COLD! Under non existent cheese and a scoop of guacamole. The rootbeer from the fountain tasted like flat coke!  Oh and I forgot to mention... There were only 3-4 other people in the restaurant at the time. (In case you think it was super busy and that might be the excuse). Top it off ...cost was $17.00 for this meal! Lesson learned. I know he won't go back and not sure I would try them myself!  Sorry Boardwalk you need to step up your game if you want to make it in the burger business in Calgary!"}
{"text":"Hurray! What a great place. Everything was delicious. Great portion sizes. We had a burger and fries. Cooked well. Chocolate milkshake was amazing! Good good good Nice staff, okay prices...okay prices"}
{"text":"Boardwalk is an American franchise that made its early fortune in french fries (according to their website). So, were they any good? Yeah, but not the best fries I've ever had (I prefer wedge cut with the skin on). They're better than most fast food chains though.   We also tried their garden salad. (There was no caesar salad option, or we would have preferred that.) Sometimes you get a salad from anywhere and it looks like it has been preassembled, maybe lightly frozen and shipped across the country in an armpit, but this garden salad was better than most restaurant salads I can recall as far as fresh ingredients go. The largely chopped pieces of iceberg lettuce were very crisp, the diced tomatoes were fresh, and the italian dressing seemed homemade (or at least not from a bottle we recognized). Some of our lettuce pieces were absurdly huge though. A testament to their freshness, I suppose.   The chocolate milkshake was deemed supercreamy and delicious and the Boardwalk Classic burger was \"the best fast food burger ever,\" so they scored some points there. I like that there are a bunch of unusual burger topping options, like sauteed mushrooms, chipotle sauce and grilled onions. Well, unusual compared to Dairy Queen, but not Smashburger. The veggie burger was really nice, and their website claims they handmake their burgers every morning, I also feel that the same care is put into their veggie burgers.   The interior is sort of Quaker meets 50s retro, and the staff seem to enjoy their work and like their jobs. Or at least these ones did. Our order of 3 burgers, fries, and milkshake took about 10-15 minutes to prepare, which was well worth the wait.  Since they're called Boardwalk Fries I should mention some of the other options: chili cheese fries, putine, garlic parmesan fries, bacon cheddar ranch fries, etc. And they have kids meals and grilled cheese sandwiches. I should deduct a point for not having a caesar salad, but and there could have been more red cabbage in the salad, but there's a lot of caesar salads in Crowfoot and I don't really like any of them either. So, five stars it is!"}
{"text":"We actually don't mind the food here and have frequented this restaurant almost weekly since October.  Tonight however, we walked out of this restaurant due to the ignorance of the guy that was taking our order.  As soon as he came to the till we could tell he was not happy, it was 9:10 and they close at 10:00 so assumed he was mad because we came in so late.  Without a word to us, he just started hammering on the computer and took our order, the larger our order got the more upset he became.  Finally the last straw was ordering a milkshake, when he said in his snotty voice ... \"Oh yeah .... of course you want a milkshake\" and went back to slamming his fingers on his computer.  At that point we had enough and proceeded to tell him not to worry about it and walked out.  I have never been treated so disrespectfully ... regardless of how much we like the food here, we won't be back."}
{"text":"What I wanted? A big, thick and creamy milkshake. What I got? A teeny tiny, watery and flavorless drink. I couldn't see why people were complaining of the price until I was handed literally 250mls for $6... and poor quality.  I also had fries and they were nothing special either.   Service was decent...  I'm not a huge Peter's aficionado, but I'll be needing to go there to satisfy this crazy milkshake craving! Boardwalk just couldn't deliver. I likely won't go back to try the burgers with such mediocre shakes and fries."}
{"text":"Came here about a year ago when they first opened. The service was slow, the food 'meh' and the seating uncomfortable. Decided to give it a second try (after the restaurant we want to go to was packed) and the service is even slower (completely forgot the milkshakes we ordered) the food still 'meh', and of course the seats are still uncomfortable."}
{"text":"For a fantastic burger to go or with family to stay we've made this our go-to burger and mmmmilkshake (mm with cherry+whipped cream). The two people who own it are great people too, they even remembered the names of our kids :-) ... And it's so much better than other burger spots, our kids like the \"burger and milkshake store\" and so do we... We'll keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Worth a try.    The burgers are fresh and hand formed.   You can order one of 6 options or build your own.   I had the mushroom Swiss burger and it was terrific.   They also have fries, poutine, salads, turkey burgers and shakes.    The service is outstanding."}
{"text":"I wanted a simple chicken breast sandwich for take-out on the way home so landed at Boardwalk. The service was pleasant. The order was ready quickly and I was good to go! It was a tasty sandwich! For sure I would order it again."}
{"text":"My companion had the chicken tenders with fries and I had the chicken breast sandwich - for take-out. We both agreed the fries were just okay. He and I were both pleased with the sandwich and the tenders. We would go there again for a convenient tasty meal. The service was friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"It's not that the food was bad but the service was garbage. Rude and unfriendly. I be eaten at the 85th Street store and had a way better experience. Service is important and I'm sorry if me wanting to spend my money in your store is an inconvenience to you. I wont be back to Fairmont store again."}
{"text":"A great good tasting burger and fries. Not your typical fast food joint with with creative burger options and really friendly staff.  I went on the weekend and they have televisions to watch sports like the Grey Cup game if you wanted.   I didn't order a drink so they came out and gave me a cup of water... Very thoughtful."}
{"text":"I try to post positive reviews on Yelp, there is enough negativity in the world. Unfortunately I had to share our experience. After wanting to eat here for several months my girlfriend and I finally stopped in for a bite. The milkshake machine was broken, we waited 10 mins for our dry burgers that were not dressed the way we ordered them. These burgers and fries run for around $6.50 each and don't come close to a burger and fries from A&W that will be ready in 60 seconds for much less $$.  I'm sure this joint claims to be in the same class as 5 Guys or Fatburger but they really don't come close. I don't think Boardwalk will be around in Calgary for long."}
{"text":"This Boardwalk Burger joint was a totally underwhelming experience, the wife and I went and 1/2 way through our burgers we looked at one another and I said, \"We should have gone to 5guys,\" she replied, \"Yep.\"  The things that truly made this experience underwhelming were:  1) No seasoning on anything. Fries were bland, burger had no flavour.  Let's put it this way, if you take a bite of this burger and close your eyes, it doesn't really taste like anything. I knew some kind of food was in my mouth.. but nothing more. It wasn't bad, it was just... nothing.  2) Stale and hard buns. The bun is a critical aspect of a burger experience. This bun competes with the burger... It's like they aren't friends at all, when the burger+bun really need to be bros - working together to maximize the eaters experience.  3) Milkshake... our vanilla milk shake tasted like frozen milk. No flavour. The thing that really bothered me is the photo shows a 'classic' milkshake with whip and a cherry. What we got was very very far from it.  While I don't have the heart to give this one star, I had to give it real consideration. But the food didn't poison me, it didn't taste bad. it just tasting like nothing. (For perspective a raw potato tastes like something... this... not so much.)"}
{"text":"A new place in Crowfoot! Right next to TJ Nails and the men's clothing place. Apparently we have two locations in Calgary. Crowfoot and in the SE (Fairmont Dr)  A great little place for burgers, shakes and fries. More upscale than your average fast food place.  The place was packed and had a constant line up the entire time we were there for lunch.    We ordered: - Boardwalk classic burger (single) - BBQ Bacon burger (single) - Kids  grill cheese meal (comes  with drink + small fries) - Poutine - Strawberry and Cookies n cream Milk Shake  Loved the burgers and shakes were awesome!  The poutine was okay, not the best I have had and for almost $7.00 I was expecting  it to be a bit better. The kids grill cheese meal was nice, but they only have two kids meals (grill cheese and chicken fingers) They do need  a bit more variety for kids. Maybe a hot dog or a mini cheese burger meal? Maybe a veggie option?  The decor is nice and the food is fresh.  It's a great place for families and for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Had poutine, burger and milkshakes. Only average and a little pricey. On a Saturday afternoon, only 1 person on shift doing both the order taking and cooking.  Will not return and wouldn't recommend. For the price, definitely prefer Fatburger."}
{"text":"3 burgers, 2 poutines, 2 shakes. One small milk. $50 plus..quality wasn't there for the price."}
{"text":"Pretty decent burger, not the best that I've had. The Parmesan Garlic fries were very good, fries were just right.  Only had the single burger and I am a big guy but I did not have any room for a milkshake."}
{"text":"Kind of disapointing. Only went once.  The meat of my burger was chewy. Like an Harvey's pattie.  At least McDonalds dont make chewy patties.   For better burgers go to Fatburger, Smash burger or Five Guys...real meat! That's premium for me."}
{"text":"Went to adjacent Subway and friend went here alone since I refused to return.  Got his meal and after 2 bites asked me if I wanted to swap for his sub...NO THANKS!"}
{"text":"Wasn't really impressed by their burgers. We lived close by this place and we just recently tried their food. Fries and milkshakes were good, but their burger was a so-so. It wasn't served warm to us when there just 3 tables of customers (including us) at that time, and it was around 7pm.."}
{"text":"So we dropped in last week since I was really in the mood for a great milkshake, and this place was close to the theatre.  We had their burgers, fries and milkshakes.  I was not that impressed, J was a little more satisfied.  The vanilla shake was from a machine, and my first impression is that it was a slurry used for other milkshakes or purposes.  The burgers and fries were OK, they had a good taste to them.  BUT, if you have the name Burgers and Fries in your name, these items better be spectacular if you want return business.  I think next time we'll head down to Angel's or Dells in Bowness.  Those milkshakes are thick, excellent and hand-made."}
{"text":"I've never been to this location but the new one they opened up in NE Calgary has a lot of unorganized idiots working there! Waited 45 mins for an order which they continuously kept getting wrong and in the end when we got home they had given us 2 orders of chilli cheese fries. Get your shit together!! First and last time I'll be going to this place! I'll be complaining at their head office too! Not only that but the burgers ate substandard and fries were not fully  cooked. I would rather go to Carl's Jr. rather than eat at this place again. Certainly not worth what you pay for. Five Guys Burgers are so much better!"}
{"text":"This place is gone down hill fast since new owners took over. When we first starting going here it was actually really good, and the staff was friendly. We stopped going here because of quality of food was bad slow service and the lady in front could not take an order properly. So we decided months after we stopped going to frequent once again and low and behold same lady behind cash. Not friendly, obviously not listening to when you place a order because the order got messed up again. The food was sub par portion are even smaller than before and the place is dirty. The cook came out and started cleaning tables with a paper napkin and then proceed back in kitchen to cook. I believe that this is another classic case of husband/wife team that cheaped out and don't fully understand that your suppose to actually keep a restaurant clean. If I could I give this place o stars."}
{"text":"I went here many years ago when it first opened. I don't even remember what year that was. Anyways, it was awful! I went with my Grandma and Grandpa and we promised we would never come here again.  Well, recently we got a list of coupons in the mail and you know when you get coupons to a restaurant in the mail it means they are not doing well. I don't know if that is the case for this place but the coupons came saying it was under new management so I figured I would give it a shot.  I used the coupon for getting the signature fries and then one medium fries for free. I thought this would take a couple minutes to order pay get my food and go.  No, it was almost 15 minutes just for fries because they are not prepared. Usually fast food places have the fries in the cooker ready to go but they weren't they had to get them out of the bag and put them in the deep frier and these people were walking SO slowly as though the didn't care about my time.  When I finally got my food the first order of fries was good but the child on it was so dry! I would expect child that was going on french fries to be runny and saucy and delicious to smother the fries- not at all.  None the less as you can see from the second picture- my free medium fries were hardly cooked and not even the slightest bit crispy or brown.  I will not be coming back here despite coupons or not."}
{"text":"Tried this place today, my wife pulling and tugging on my arm.  First the food. It was so hot, we couldn't eat it right away. I'm not joking. it was PIPING hot.  I tried a classic double, the wife did a 'make it yourself burger'  The buns are of good quality - they don't get soggy or come apart. Very nice. Meat quality excellent, not crumbly, but a bit more solid. Very pleasing.  Fries were tasty and stayed warm throughout the meal.  It will remind you of 5 guys to a point, but the biggest difference is that lighting is a bit more subdued and the noise levels are far lower.  I wasn't sure to try it out, and no yelp help. But you can rest assured that you will be full with a double, small fries and small drink.   Burgers are my favourite food in the world - and Boardwalk has just earned a place with the best of them.   Great staff service as well. I complimented the manager on the way out on the quality and value, I was that impressed."}
{"text":"Service was outstanding I had the mushroom swiss burger. it was fantastic. worth going again. after the 3rd visit the burger size is smaller and less fries."}
{"text":"I did a create your own burger.  The burger was smothered in sauce.  ITs as if when the lady was putting the sauce on she didnt care at all and just threw on so much sauce that everything becomes a sogging mess.    The burgers should have been a piece of cake as they had an amzing machine which is supposed to cook the burger automatically, if only the person cooking cared enough to use it properly.  The burger was barley cooked fully, it could have used another minute or two, he was definitly rushing it.   He didnt care even about food safety and I had to tell him to switch his gloves when dealing with raw meat and cooked meat.  The gloves arn't there for him to keep his hands clean, they are there to protect the customer from food poisoning.  AFter telling him to change his gloves, he proceeded to make excuses and argue, and i basically had to yell at him to change his gloves and then he reluctantly , because the manager was there, said \"OH OK I CHANGE MY GLOVES \"..  They are definitly not following proper food saftey at this place.  When the cook is dealing with raw meat and he then has cooked the meat, it needs to be dealt with using clean gloves and utensils used for cooked meat.  Or Have one person cooking the patties, and one person dealing with constructing the \"cooked\" burger, really its only a 2 man job to make the burger and fries, while there was at least 6 people working there.  The milkshakes are just soft-serve ice-cream.   That being said , there are some positives.  The fries were fresh, because I insisted.  And they have a nice spice that goes on fries and tastes quite delish.  The price for a meal, around 12$, is appropriate for any fast food chain and is a better deal than most burger joints around town.  The burger when made did look quite good, I think the major thing is just the staff dont really care, but I think the manager does."}
{"text":"We came for lunch break. Service was great, staff was friendly and location was clean.  I had the BBQ bacon cheddar, burger was fresh and not to messy. I loved the bun to burger ratio. We where also recommend the signature loaded fries. We tried the bacon cheddar ranch and they where amazing, definitely best to share as there where a ton. Over all a good lunch spot"}
{"text":"I couldn't even finish my burger, it was so gross. It tastes like a microwaved patty and not even real beef. $30 for 2 of us, soggy fries. Will not be returning here again!!"}
{"text":"This place is close to home so it's in our routine. Solid burger joint - you definitely won't be disappointed. The only drawback is the location. You have to really want to go there as navigating Crowfoot Crossing is a chore at the best of times. If I could walk there with the kids without enduring Crowfoot Crossing and the Hyundai-piloting-derby-enthusiasts I would be a regular."}
{"text":"Coupon brought us in, good food and atmosphere will have us returning. You wouldn't know how big the place is by looking from the parking lot - long and deep. Nice tables, clean, good music etc. We liked the burgers - they tasted like ones I make at home. My adult oldest son really likes the milkshakes - I haven't tried them but they look good. Good choices for extra toppings (free)."}
{"text":"At $30 for two pretty simple meals, this place does NOT deliver in food quality.   I will say that both their fries and onion rings were excellent. They use freezer McCain fries but whatever spice they put on them is delicious. The rings are crunchy and not at all soggy. The milkshakes we had were fantastic.   The burgers... ohh, the burgers. I could have found more flavour if I'd licked the floor. I had the BBQ Bacon burger and the only thing I could taste was the bbq sauce. They don't seem to season the chewy meat at all, nor any other part of the burger. The bun was huge and doughy. Overall a severely disappointing burger worth, at most, $2."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars.  Have been here twice.  Maybe, I might go back  The burgers are good.  Still looking for a great burger. I can appreciate the brioche buns, but a choice of buns would be nice as they are a little sweet for my liking. The fries were excellent. A little expensive for what you get. The service was five star."}
{"text":"I saw the sign for Boardwalk opening in Crowfoot and I was STOKED!! I love a good burger joint!  I went in and ordered a bacon cheeseburger, small fries and a   peanut butter shake.  Took my number and went and sat.  I looked around and got the vibe that this was part of a chain.  You can usually tell the places that have had the touch of a corporate designer.  After a quick google search, my hunch was confirmed.  An american company with quite a few restaurants.    I looked up from my phone just to see my shake being finished behind the counter by oil based whipped topping was squeezed out of a can onto it..disappointing.  My food arrived, and it looked very good.  There were signs on the walls claiming that they had \"famous fries\" so of course I tried them first.  Not sure who declared them famous, but they were good.  Nicely salted.  Next the burger, it was pretty tasty, cheese was overly processed, but the bun was great!  A good burger can be made or broken with a bun!  Again, more signs claiming that they use fresh, never frozen beef.  The shake was ok, nothing special.  I paid almost $17 for the meal.  The price point was far too high for the quality of the product they put out.  To be honest, it was not far off from a meal that I could have at Wendy's for less than half the price.  So overall, a bit disappointing after having been excited for a new burger joint in my neighbourhood.  Really just a overpriced fast food place.  Sorry, but not sold on Boardwalk.  And the location is awful.  I don't see it being there long."}
{"text":"good burger, nice fresh bun. very large portion of poutine. server was super friendly. only down side is for 2 burgers, 2 drinks, and a poutine came to approx $36."}
{"text":"Quickly seated, burger was just as I expected. Milkshake was a nice touch to the burger. Price was decent."}
{"text":"Walked into an extremely unkept Boardwalk burger joint on Fairmont Drive in Calgary. I ordered a veggie burger. The burger was brought out with bacon on it. I assure you, I did not order bacon. I brought the issue up to the man behind the counter and asked for another burger, as I am a vegetairan and simply taking it off is not an option for me. Moments later he emerged from the kitchen handing the same burger to me having simply removed the the larger pieces of bacon. Leaving behind, what looked like the bacon leavings on a pan after making breakfast, stuck in the cheese. I did eventually get my money back but the shifty manner with which my issue was handled assures I will never go back."}
{"text":"I've been here three times. The first two times were very good. The burgers are fine for the price, not outstanding but definitely worth it.  The milkshakes are really thick and filling.    I went in today to get a milkshake, but I had to use the washroom PRONTO.  Now I don't know who this man thought I was but I came out to \"Buy something or I'm calling the police!\"\" Of course,  at this point,  I'm shocked and certainly not thinking about buying \"anything\". When I informed the cashier that I did not like his tone and that it was rude to speak to anyone that way, I was met with a \"People like you are my problem\". Could there be any worse customer service? So, in summation,  the food may be okay but I will never go back to any Boardwalk after this experience."}
{"text":"A newcomer to Crowfoot!  A great place for burgers and shakes.  The 20% coupon definitely boosted their sales this weekend.  The place was packed and had a continuous line up the entire time we were there.   We ordered: - Hawaiian burger - BBQ Bacon burger - Medium fries & gravy - Strawberry Shake  Love their buns and the strawberry shake was awesome!  Burgers were decent and liked the variety of toppings.  Fries were meh!  I like my fries extra crispy and I assume as it was so busy that they were just rushing as I had asked for them extra crispy.  The decor is nice and love the fountain pop station (refills!).  It's a great place for families and easy quick meals.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Skip this place and go to Subway next door.   This is a mediocre rip off of Five guys.  18 minutes to cook a cheese burger and a junior burger.  With fries & a coke came to $18.  And it was really bad food and the service was terrible. This made me wish there was a McDonalds nearby."}
{"text":"Decent. The burger and fries I had were OK, but not particularly tasty. It basically tasted like a burger I'd make myself at home - but if I wanted that, I'd just BBQ one myself right? The prices were a bit high, but not outrageous. The food was just a bit bland - I don't think I'd come back because it just didn't stand out."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I had the experience of coming here when all of the students from across the street descended on this place for lunch. They have a sign on the door about not bringing in outside food to deter the number of students, but there's no one enforcing it.  The staff member taking my order was nice and friendly. I took my receipt and drink and grabbed a table to wait for my order. And I waited...and waited. My co-worker who was with me that ordered after me got his order first. I get that some things can take longer than others, but we both ordered a burger. Then I waited some more. I finally got up to find out what was taking so long as my co-worker was almost done eating by this time. The cashier had disappeared into the back and was moving boxes or something around. There were three or four orders on the counter ready to go, but no one in the kitchen seemed to care and didn't bother to alert the missing employee from the front. She eventually came back to pass out the orders.  Overall the food was just ok. There's signs everywhere that make America's best fries. They're not even close to being the best of anything. Also, you're in Canada now and its obnoxious to be touting that line. The burger was nothing special. It was fine, but overpriced for what it was.  I'd like to give these guys another try maybe on a weekend or for dinner during the week as I'm sure the overall experience would be better when there isn't the student rush going on."}
{"text":"Boardwalk is now open in Crowfoot.  We got a 20% discount promo on our menu that was delivered to the house yesterday.  So we decided to put the 20% promo to good use.  Ordered: -Chipotle Burger - bland -Avocado Bacon - where is the avocado?  All I see is a thin schmear on one side of the bun; also bland -Poutine - need some salt -Fries - need seasoning, especially salt  Did takeout.  All in all the food was just meh.    The restaurant was packed and there was a bit of a wait for takeout food.  It was bit dark in the restaurant.  You order first and then get assigned a number either for takeout or dine-in."}
{"text":"As a parent of 2 lil monsters, I am often on the look out for meal options that aren't McDs.  So I recently checked this place out with my family.   It is a counter ordering with table delivery style burger joint.  They specialize in milkshakes and fresh made burgers.  I tried the mushroom Swiss and found it quite yummy-messy with lots of toppings.  My husband enjoyed the chipotle burger and we split the poutine.  No lack of cheese curds but a little too much gravy.    The chocolate shake was thick and rich with whipped cream and a cherry on top.  My kids had chicken fingers and grilled cheese from the kids menu.  I liked that they offered juice boxes as a beverage instead of pop.      We will be back.  Not all the time because it  isn't cheap, but I am leaving full and happy!"}
{"text":"Popped into this place after a recommendation from a friend who is an avid burger connoisseur, their verdict was they serve up fresh tasty burgers.   It's a nice clean little burger joint, obviously family owned and operated as the cashier was very attentive and friendly...you order up your meal and they give you a number and they call you when your food is ready. Items are ordered seperately so you order your burger and it will run you upwards of $6 then you order your side of fries which runs upwards of $4 and a drink which I believe was around $2, shakes are available too but I generally steer away from heavy creamy concocted beverages.  They have poutine offerings with several toppings and those will run you over $6 for a basic.  You are looking at about a $13 lunch for a specialty burger combo, they do have a basic single cheese burger lunch combo for around $9, so it's pretty much a treat type burger place.  I agree the burgers are very tasty!  I ordered the mushroom truffle burger; meat was fresh and juicy, seasoned well, bun was fantastic, plenty of mushroomy goodness and melty cheese was pretty darn good, although I am sure it was processed.  We decided on sharing a chicken strip basket as well and they were good although the strips were quite thin and there was only 4 strips so for a meal it might be small if that is all you had.  The fries are just ok, I was expecting thick cut restaurant style fries and they were basically your regular run of the mill frozen russet variety fries.  For the two of us, for two burgers, a drink, a basket of fries and strips ran about $25.  I imagine that if a family of four came here and ordered specialty burgers, each got a fries and each got a drink you would probably pay upwards of $50.  All in all, Boardwalk is a great little burger place if you want to change it up from Rotten Ronnies or BK but it will cost you a few dollars more and there is a bit of a wait but everything is served up fresh and with a smile.  Solid 3.5, I will be back if I was in the area."}
{"text":"One of my new favorite burger stops for sure..Excellent,polite service,Tasty Sriacha burger,just a little spice,Fries were unique and awesome! Thank you for an Awesome dining experience!!"}
{"text":"Finally get to try this joint. I'm surprise the bill came to 60 bucks for 4 of us. I wish the fries is included with the burger. I got the Chipotle burger with iced tea. My sis got burger and shake, her friend got a shake, and colin got burger fries and shake.  Milkshake was great. Small size for 6 bucks. I think it's like fat burger almost except the burgers are smaller. Overall it was ok. Just wish the prices weren't that high specially with the economic down turn. If I do go back, I would try the milkshake. The whip n cherry is included...not extra...rank goodness. The serving of fries is alot though so it's a share thing. Unless your Uber hungry. 3 stars since I think the value and portion is mismatched."}
