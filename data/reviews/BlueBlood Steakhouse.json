{"text":"A reservation on a Sunday night was a breeze per Open Table.  The place was almost full.  Self park was $10 and valet was optional at $15.  We opted for the self park as it was so close to the door.  The castle is huge but the restaurant is where the blue lights shine on the west side.  The castle had been in bad shape and was once ordered to be torn down but the City invested $33 million a few years ago and its in good shape again.  The installation of the restaurant in the bar area almost doesn't fit, and the wood-paneled dining room has been confused by its furnishings.  The bankettes look awkward and the antler light fixtures are an amateur deign note.  A huge painting of Prince above the fireplace looks ridiculous and a poor quality painting of the Queen round out a poor furnishing job.  They could have done so much better.  The food was quite good, recommend the truffle mash potatoes.  Had the ribeye which was underdone and had to be sent back, whereafter it was excellent.  But, It was a $65 steak with no sides that should have cost $40 max.  After you add two sides at $20 each, you're talking $100 for an entree.  The service was excellent and our waiter was a gem.  Attentive and totally pro.  It's worth going to see, just so you can say you have dined in a castle.  But you likely won't return again and again as the overall value is so poor."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but wow, what a disappointment. Don't believe the hype. The atmosphere and decor of the restaurant is stunning. Too bad we couldn't enjoy it because we had the worse seat in the house as they put us in a corner with a lousy view of a wall radiator in a sub par room they call the loft. Haaaa! What a joke. The whole part of the experience is to enjoy the castle like atmosphere but rather we felt so disconnected giving us the worst case of FOMO ever because it was the \"Oak Room\" that we wanted to be in. Service was top notch tho and the staff really take care of you. Unfortunately, the experience stops there. The biggest failure here was the steak. We ordered a bone in strip-loin and a filet. Both under seasoned, no char and finished with buttery mess. Tough, chewy and not tender at all. It almost felt like I was eating a boiled piece of meat. For the price I expect my steak to be perfect. I've had steaks from Costco that were better than this garbage. The sides were nothing impressive either. Crispy polenta cubes were actually soft and the broccolini over cooked. Wagyu beef carpaccio was good but again, not for $35. Add in some overpriced wine and Boom! $350. Goodnight"}
{"text":"Place overrated. I went with two other friends. Requested a booth and got a table... Plus I mentioned that it was my friend's birthday and they brought nothing out, not a cake or anything. The waitress never mentioned about paying the bottled of water. I then saw she was punching in something as she went to place the water bottle away. We asked her if it's per bottle and she said yes ($8.50 the bottle of water!!) and immediately her attitude changed (my waitress was Emily). She didn't come to see my table nor did she ask if we needed anything else. Once we paid the bill, I had a perfect view of the computer for the waitresses. I saw that she was comparing our bills (we didn't tip her that well as she wasn't amazing). Two waitresses were laughing and she rolled her eyes at my table all angry. Very disappointed, and would not go back. The atmosphere and the view was nice, the service was HORRIBLE."}
{"text":"Not the greatest steakhouse in the city


The service is very slow do not order the kale side dish worst thing I've ever tasted.  
It is not close to the level of Harbour 60 more like STK with no ambiance and very expensive. Be prepared to spend 250 person with shared courses. And no desert"}
{"text":"Meh.
The service was excellent. Great atmosphere. The steak was just ok. The cocktails took forever but the were excellent. Had the 35 day dry aged Tomahawk to share and while it looked impressive, it was grossly underseasoned. We did ask for salts and they have a selection of 3. After putting on the salt it was much better. Call me crazy but I'm just of the opinion that for $200 your steak should be seasoned correctly and it should come out perfect and not need me to add stuff to it.
The tableside ceasar salad was well made and one of the best I've had. 
So essentially everything was great about this Steakhouse, except for the steak."}
{"text":"Honestly, one of the worst meals I've had in this city for a long time. So expensive, wine list is way over priced and unobtainable for most. You are looking at a 800$ bill or up for two. Resturant is visually appealing, I guess, nothing spectacular...But acoustics are horrible. Don't think you are having a romantic dinner. Plus it's too dark. Service is great, but I was a bit thrown by 15$ parking$, really it's an empty lot in the middle of no where and the steaks starts at 100$, please spare me. I would happily pay up for this experience but food was not good at all. None of it. Meat was tough couldn't cut it. I wrapped it up and gave it to my dog and left hungry."}
{"text":"Came here with family to celebrate my birthday on March 11. Chris our server and his team was great, very attentive especially when our water was getting low they came and filled up straight away. Chris was very good at suggesting what would be good for us to order and share, even suggested that he can ask the seafood chef's to to make the seafood tower enough for 6 people rather than for 4. The porterhouse and tomahawk steak was very flavorful, cooked exactly how we requested. Very nice steakhouse and very good service would recommend to anyone asking for a highend steakhouse to dine at."}
{"text":"A perfect steak, flare cocktails, and amazing service, it's not a fairytale - but you do need to visit a castle! 

Our experience here was awesome!  The entrance is on the rightside of the building.
The hostesses were welcoming and took our coats for us. 

We chose to be seated at the bar and it was fun to watch the drinks in fire, engulfed in smoke, and expertly crafted.

The steak selection varies and there is a selection of waygu if that's what you fancy.

The crab cakes, lobster mac cheese, both good choices.

The baked Alaska is served with fiery flare. It was cold and hot at delicious!

Love this place!!! :D"}
{"text":"Came here because of blogto post. Couldn't get a reservation until 9:30pm on a Friday and that's fine because it's the weekend. We got here 5 minutes early and they advised the reservation will take even longer and we can wait in the lounge where a waitress would take our drink order. We waited about 10 minutes and no one approached us. We went upstairs where the server completely ignored us and finally a girl came and took our order. A fire alarm came and the server acknowledged everyone except us. Later the GM came and apologized for the wait and gave us drink on the house. ( he's probably the only one so far who knows how proper customer service should be delivered, I've been in customer service industry for over 10 years, and let me tell you that it doesn't deliver the expectations as we expected) overall, the experience was a two star for me."}
{"text":"I took out two good friends yesterday to celebrate at BlueBlood. Overall I was super impressed with everything from the service, to decor, to the meal itself.

We had a late start to the dinner so the place was less full than I expected. Were seated promptly and started off with cocktails and beer. Fantastic house old fashioned. Were suggested a great bottle of Malbec from BC (!? Did not know that's possible!), had 2. For dinner we had the Wagyu Sampler between 2 people plus one of us had a tenderloin. Sides were fries with duckfat and potatoes. Dessert? Killer. 

Our server was great and attentive, the drinks and food were awesome. Great place for a special meal. I'd go back."}
{"text":"Came here for my anniversary and I have to say that the setting was beautiful! Imagine dining inside a castle and seated near the fireplace. The staff made this evening more special by handing us a cute card congratulating us on another milestone and the service was exceptional. We ordered a couple of cocktails, and I believe one of them was called 'Once Upon a Time' and literally your drink came inside a glass dome, like Beauty and The Beast haha. 

For the main, we had the Tamohawk dry aged steak in medium rare; enjoyed it, but had better steak elsewhere. We also enjoyed having wedged fries, which were deep fried in duck fat - SO good, with their in-house sauce. Everything else was just exceptional and even had one of the lovely ladies at the front take pictures of my partner and I for a good 15-20min; it was like having our own personal photographer haha. 

Note that they do valet parking and it's only $10!"}
{"text":"The food & experience were fantastic.  There were areas of improvement in our experience, but I'm still giving them a 5* review.  Prices are higher than Jacobs, but you're at the Casa Loma, what do you expect?  My father enjoyed it so much, he wants to come back for my birthday.

Service - Great.  Our server was attentive and present for most of the evening.  It was a packed dining room for a Tuesday night.  Water refills were always there.  My wife felt like they were \"trying too hard\", but I found it appropriate.

Reservation confirmations - I think we had at least 5 calls to confirm our reservation in the week leading up to our dinner.  Way too much for my liking.

Ambience - It's Casa Loma, definitely a cool place to be.  Add curtains to the windows to block the sun!

Dinner length - We arrived at 5:30 and didn't get out till around 8.  Far too long for our liking.

Food - !! Mmmmm...

Tableside Caesar - As my father would say, \"better than Jacob's!\"
French Onion Soup - Small, but intensely flavourful! I'd say that's the best French Onion Soup I've ever had.
Oysters - Very fresh, some of the better ones in the city.
Foie gras, carpaccio, steak tartare - A solid showing, but far from best.  I'd actually say these were disappointing based on price & standards.
Steaks - We had Australian wagyu, and Canadian steaks at the table.  For Canadian steaks, they were fantastic, best I've had.
Fries - The biggest fries we've ever had.  Each fry felt like the size of 4 Kit-Kat bars stacked in a 2x2 formation.
Cognac Peppercorn sauce - Recommended by server, and it was amazing.
Sea bass - They gave the whole fish.  Wow.  Great value here.
Baked Alaska - A great show for dessert.
Poached Peach - Good."}
{"text":"I ate dinner at Blueblood Steakhouse on Thursday night (November 2) and to be honest I would have to rate my experience as a C+ or just above average.

First the positives: Your staff. From your hostesses that welcomed me to my server, Dejan to those bussing my table, I found them courteous, pleasant and seemingly enthusiastic about working at Blueblood. Dejan gave two excellent recommendations a) the glass of wine I had and b) my appetizer, the tuna tartare which was truly amazing. 

*I also liked that he brought a stool for my purse so that I didn't have to put it on the floor by me or keep getting up and getting from the other seat.*

As for the steak? I knew I wanted to try 2 oz of the Japanese, Kagoshima, A5  Rib Eye and compare it with one of the other steaks. After hearing Dejan's excellent knowledge of the steaks, I decided to chose the 12 oz Dry Aged 35 Days Centre Cut Striploin from Rockwood, Ontario. I was very specific with how I wanted both steaks done: the striploin I wanted rare to medium rare at the most but I knew to have the full flavour of the waygu, because it is so marbled (and having tasted it at other restaurants before), it needed to be cooked to medium. And that is EXACTLY what I received. Both steaks were absolutely fantastic.

Dessert was fun, I had the profiteroles and I enjoyed the presentation of it being under a chocolate dome and having it disappear via a warm chocolate sauce. I also probably had one of the best cappuccinos in the city which could be due to the fact that all the equipment is fairly new lol but it was excellent.

Now here are my negatives: While my server came to check on me with the appetizer and a few minutes after I got my entree, unfortunately I hadn't taken a bite of my duck fat thick fries. While they looked cooked, they were actually raw. Now I could've and probably should've thrown attention to them but I was enjoying the steak too much to really care about the side dish BUT when Dejan came by to see if I wanted to have the remainder of my steak to go, I'm surprised he didn't ask why I barely touched my fries. It is that small attention to details that sets a good average restaurant to one that is five star. Every part of the meal needs to be excellent. Btw, I would recommend slicing the fries to normal instead of thick.

I sat in one of the intimate tables for two. While the seat looks nice and comfy, as some others have noted they REALLY are not conducive to eating. For myself I could've used a cushion at my back because if I sat back, it was too deep for me to reach my food but sitting forward wasn't that comfortable either. Also I found the actual height of the table just a smidge too high. With proper seating, it would likely not make a difference but because my seat wasn't the greatest, the height of the table is quite noticeable.

As for the actual decor of the restaurant itself? I think this is where I was most underwhelmed. I found the decor tasteful and I could see the time and effort that was put into the design and decor BUT absolutely nothing told me that I was dining in an early 20th century castle. To be honest,  I could've been eating dinner at any steakhouse in Toronto and if that's the case because not all aspects of my meal was up to par in comparison to what I have eaten at many fantastic steakhouses in the GTA, I can only cautiously recommend Blueblood Steakhouse.

HOWEVER, I know you've only been opened for less than two months and that you're still working out the kinks. I do like hearing about your plans to open up the balcony for al fresco dining when the warm weather happens again which will give in to the atmosphere of being in a castle, especially looking over the lovely gardens.  

Because of your staff and how fantastic my steak was cooked, I look forward to dining at Blueblood Steakhouse again but likely not until the spring. Hopefully by then most of the 'jitters' of a new restaurant will have gone away."}
{"text":"I'm giving two stars, instead of just one, on account of the compassionate gentlemen who called a cab for my elderly parents on this icy evening.  Otherwise, food and service left much to be desired. Average Manhattan cocktails.  Greasy crab cakes. Amateurish wedge salads.  Raw, undercooked sourdough bread.  Passive-aggressive waitress who simply could not welcome any constructive feedback.  Porterhouse steak was dreadful (cold, congealed fat, and I actually spat out four gristly mouthfuls).  Disgusting sides: leaden Gorgonzola gnocchi, spinach with a pool of cream on the bottom, as if it were an afterthought.  And the absolute worst Béarnaise sauce ever.  What a shame! It had the texture of wallpaper paste.  Gross desserts: lemon meringue pie that did not taste like lemon, meringue, or pie.  A baked Alaska that was big on pyrotechnics but low on flavour (meringue was an epic fail on it).  Once again, passive-aggressive waitress had to chime on the profiterole, saying it was \"puff pastry.\"  It was not.  Since when are profiteroles made of puff pastry?  And she was actually trying to argue with me!  Profiteroles are made of choux pastry.  And this choux pastry was simply awful.  
I would give one and one half stars, if I could.  
They made a big production of giving us Prosecco on the house, as if it were a grand gesture.  It was cheap, gross Prosecco.  
I will not return."}
{"text":"3.5 overall but down to three for the outrageously priced wine list! Holy mark-up Batman!

Came in for dinner with a group of 4. 

Seafood tower was just ok nothing special for the price.  Jacobs tower is definitely better. 

We had the waygu sampler which was really good. However the server didn't explain where each sample came from - we had to ask. We also had waygu rib eye from Nevada that was delish!

Sides were all very good. Nicely prepared with fresh ingredients and flavourful. 

Drinks took a long time to arrive which was kind of annoying but I will say they were all amazing including the smoke infused whiskey we had after dinner. 

One bathroom for the whole restaurant and the rest of the Casa Loma visitors meant we were away from the table for 10-20 minutes coming back to food that was sitting there waiting. REALLY NOT COOL! 

Meh. I'd return for drinks and appetizers but I'll stick with Jacobs as my go to and favourite Toronto steakhouse."}
{"text":"I have been here twice.  The first time in October and then on Christmas Eve. I had the same things both times.

The interior of the restaurant is really nice. I mean, you're having dinner in a castle. 

With parking, the first time on-site self parking was free and the second time we had to pay.  It seems a bit cheap of the restaurant to require diners to pay for parking when the guests are going to pay about $250 per person for dinner.

The service in the restaurant was friendly and great.  Everyone was very personable.

I would go back for special occasions because of the ambiance.

The food was good and not great. It is not different from any other steak houses I have been to. 

For starters, we had the Caesar . The dressing is made infront of you which is just like Jacobs. We also had shrimp (very good), beef carpaccio (ok), tuna tartar (good).

For the main course we had the tomahawk and striploin. They purposely under season their steaks because they have 3 salts for you to try.  It's neat but some steakhouses have about 10 choices for you. The second time we went the steaks came out lukewarm and one was undercooked and had to be sent back. The kale (delicious), polenta  (ok),  fries  (ok), asparagus (great) and spinach (good).

The red wine was good. 

We were full so no dessert"}
{"text":"I will say that the only good thing was the decor and location. Casa Loma is beautiful however, BlueBloods wouldn't say the same for their food and service.

Recently came here to try out the place, their food wss nothing special. The appetizers portions were ridiculously small, yes ofc luxury restaurants have smaller plates, but this one seemed micro . Their foie Gras was seared but not cooked through properly, had gotten food poisoning from this dinner. 

The flavours of their dishes didn't add up or flow smoothly with my tastebuds. It was either too salty or pungent. 

The steak they say is lightly seasoned or if not seasoned at all I would say. The meat of the steak is good quality but no taste whatsoever. Really this place was disappointing. 

The cocktails are alot of sours and bitters with slight essence of fruit notes but were terribly unsatisfying, mostly watered down ice with alcohol is what it tastes like.  

The servers were never available to help or check up when needed. Found ourselves constantly staring and looking around for help! 


This isn't the type or service or food you expect for these prices. I can think of many other places that would do better for less too  

Lastly what really was scary was the fact that they don't have their own restrooms. You get escorted to a dungeon basement washroom that's also part of the Casa Loma Cafeteria. Total downer for the mood, experience and atmosphere. 

Overall I do not recommend this place unless your only looking for a photo op with the decor !"}
{"text":"The ambience and decor was the best part of my dining experience. The location and dining room is impressive but the food fell flat. It was average to good, but nothing to rave about. Jacobs & Co is still my favourite steakhouse in this price range.

Tip : We asked for the sides in half portions so we were able to sample more. We called in advance and were told Blue Blood allows this. The server told us it was not allowed but the confusion was cleared up by management. 

The hosts in the front of the restaurant were very friendly and accommodating. 
Our server was polite and professional but didn't do a great job explaining the different menu options and cuts. 

We ordered:

- Tableside Caesar - DELICOUS. Crispy and packed with flavour and bite.
- Japanese Kagoshima A5 Ribeye - Buttery and melt-in-your-mouth deliciousness. For Wagyu cuts, I give the credit to the cows and not the restaurant.
- Canadian Rib Eye Aged 28 Days -  Chewier than normal, bland and undersalted. An equivalent steak at Jacobs & Co was more tender and flavorful.
- Lobster Mac & Cheese - Everyone online raved about this dish so maybe I had a bad batch. The sauce was more dry/gritty than creamy and cheesy ( I couldn't really detect the cheese) and the noodles were too tough to be considered al dente.
- Foraged Mushrooms - DELICIOUS 
- Creamed Corn - Good. It was nice to have something sweet to balance everything out. 
- Duck Fat Fries - Served more as massive rectangular blocks than fries or wedges. They were okay. I prefer the version at Jacobs & Co."}
{"text":"Indulged here for my birthday because eating in a century old castle is in the top 5 bougie-est things to do in Toronto. 

All the people complaining valet/parking wasn't complementary, I get it but you're already spending a pretty penny on your meal so I don't get how that extra $20 is really gonna make a difference in your pocket... perhaps consider taking an Uber. 

5 star service. Our server really knew his stuff and was honest with his recommendations which were appreciated. 

Now for the highlights... the foie gras is a must try whether you're a foie gras lover or hater or have never tried it before, get it. I've had foie gras many ways and this is one of my favourites. The flavours were thoughtfully curated and each bite harmonized so delicately. 

Lowlights... tuna tartare, just skip it. 

Wagyus were good. Japanese, Australian then American in order that order - Porterhouse was tasty. We asked for medium and the center was still red so if you are afraid of red meat ask for a higher cook level. 

Sides were good, standard; nothing really exceptional stood out... Maybe the lobster mac. 

Cocktail list was short and wine list was basic. 

Earl grey crème brûlée was very good. If you haven't tried earl grey in a dessert, you are missing out and here's your chance. 

Overall, lovely experience. Have I had better steaks in the city? Def YES. But were they in a castle? NO."}
{"text":"The cocktails here are sublime. Oliver, the man behind the bar, is a veritable  'cocktail whisperer' . Our cocktails were made brilliantly, better than you can find anywhere else.
The old world, luxury ambience makes for a great celebratory setting, although somewhat noisy. The napkins were made of synthetic material, not of the calibre that one would expect and there were no tablecloths.

When you walk in, and as you sit down you are swarmed with people so it is very confusing as to,who is a hostess, who is in charge of wine, who is in charge of your table, who is a manager, and who, if anyone, will take your coat? As my friend I was dining with said \"far too many servers and far too little service\". Our service was very slow, it was over an hour before we actually got something to eat.

The wine list is a series of pictures of  wine labels  provided to you on a tablet, quite difficult to navigate between different genres and countries. It makes the choosing tedious and much less easy than to simply read a wine list classified according to normal types. On top of that! The Burgundy that we chose we were told was no longer in stock! Why have sophisticated technology when it can't even keep track of inventory?

We had the Caesar made beside our table which was professionally done and recommended. It was very garlicky.
The Tuna tartar was soft, deep red but not particularly tasty. There was some tough seaweed with it. The avocado went well with it, but overall it was too delicate for my unrefined taste. Plenty to share for two but not a recommended choice.
We had the Wagu tenderloin  tasting, ($250) which is a once-in-a-lifetime a fascinating experience. It arrived somewhat cold, but that didn't detract from the experience so much. The American was tougher than the other two, tasty, soft and sweet. It was more like a steak that one would recognise. The Japanese was lighter, very soft - like chocolate or butter. The Australian was more tough than the Japanese, (but not at all tough), darker and had a richer taste than the other two. We had the hand cut potatoes - they weren't really fries - which I suspect had not seen any duck fat as advertised. The asparagus arrived cold with congealed butter. The spinach was fine.

You might like this as a 'one-time try' sort of place, but it is very pretentious, noisy and not good value for money. (For close to $1,000 for two people all in, it was poor value)."}
{"text":"Walking into this venue was like utopia for me.  As all the bread is served with white truffle oil. The aroma in the dining area was amazing. The ceiling and architecture was spectacular. 

The service was absolutely top notch. I can say it's better than a lot of New York high end restaurants. From the time I've made my reservations, and I changed it around 4 times to get the timing right for the Casa Loma, legend of the horror event. The staff have been ever so patient and accommodating.

Onto the drinks, I've ordered the Once upon a time, being in a castle, I must order this and after seeing this on the blogTO. It was a little to strong for my liking, again the staff was amazing and accommodated my taste, first to add ice, then changed the drink for me.

Seared Marieville Foie Gras   28
figs, ice wine, grilled brioche. The Foie gras was absolutely seared nicely and went well with the ice wine jelly. Everything went well together. All the ingredients were a good marriage. I am usually very picky with the way that the Foie gras are seared and the temperature inside the Foie gras when I bite into it. This was done right. 

Main: Tomahawk for Two, Dakota City, and the Australian Wagyu, the Australian Wagyu was done very nicely. From flavour to texture. Highly recommend this cut.

Valet parking was only $15 compared to normal regular parking $10. I recommend to valet park.

This is by far the best steak house in Toronto, in terms of service, quality of the food, totally worth the price. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Had the valet parking been free, I would have given BlueBlood the fifth and final star.

Food was as expected, the atmosphere was louder than expected. 

I take this to be a novel experience. Once the allure of having a meal in a castle (which by the way, doesn't quite feel like it in the dining room) dissipates, the desire to be a repeat customer can be a little challenging.

Again, my pet peeve is having to for out $10 for parking when I drop in excess of $500 for dinner!"}
{"text":"Ambiance: oaky/woodie and old fashioned style atmosphere. Feels like I need to be smoking a nicenexpensive cigar while eating here. Great ambiance and romantic yet noisy and happening type of vibe.  They have a very interesting painting of Prince over a fireplace and a few Andy Warhol paintings in the pretty bar area. 

Service: our server was excellent. I can't remember his name but he was extremely attentive to our needs and also talked to us and explained each dish on the menu with detail. 

Price: Expensive! But that goes hand in hand with the quality of steaks they serve. So expect to to be spending at least $150+ per person.

Our bill came out to roughly around $700 tax-in with tip for the 4 of us. Only 2 of us had drinks from the menu. 

Would I come back Here? Yes I would but not someplace I'd come back often. Very expensive but great for a fun evening out with a small intimate group of friends."}
{"text":"Ever dined in a castle before? Well, you can!

Friends of ours had recommended Blue Blood to us, and so for our second wedding anniversary my wife and I booked a reservation to dine at this unique restaurant inside Casa Loma in downtown Toronto. 

Upon arrival we were greeted by the staff, who all wished us a happy second anniversary (I had mentioned it when I made the reservation, and when the called to confirm they asked how many years). This little gesture set the tone for the evening, and I knew we were in for something special.

We were brought to our table, which was right next to the fireplace (thank goodness, as it was a whopping -30º outside) under the watchful eye of Prince (not a Prince, but THE Prince), care of an original Mr. Brainwash. The hostess delivered the iPad wine selection, and a little card wishing us a happy anniversary (how thoughtful).

We hadn't even begun to dine yet and we were already blown away by the location. You're sitting in one of the dining rooms of the castle, and they have done an incredible job of maintaining the original look and feel while at the same time incorporating modern touches. Steak houses can sometimes feel old and stodgy - this is quite the opposite. Moreover, there was a real lack of pretension here. The wait staff weren't snooty, or judgemental, in fact quite the opposite. Our waiter, who's name I forget unfortunately, checked in the right number of times, and was always kind and gracious and polite. I can safely say, this is some of the best service I've experienced at a restaurant, especially in Toronto.

But onto the important stuff: the food. The starter, some fresh breads with a chipotle butter, was to die for. We got the table-side caesar, which if you have never experienced is a must try. A word of warning though: it's $20/person and the portions are not small - if you aren't careful you could easily fill up on salad and bread before you even get to your steak. 

As for the steak, we chose the Rib Eye from Erin Ontario to split, along with sides of asparagus and mashed potatoes. Everything was cooked to perfection, and the meat was tender, and flavourful. My wife is still raving about it being one of the best meals she's ever had. Unfortunately for me, I had started to feel under the weather just before dinner and I must admit, spent more time worrying about the waves of nausea I was experiencing to really, truly enjoy the meal. That being said, *despite* feeling ill, I did enjoy my dinner. 

For dessert my wife had the profiterole, which come hidden beneath a chocolate dome, which is melted by pouring hot caramel over it at your table. She loved it!

Of course, the prices at a place like this mean that unless you're among the Bay Street Elite you won't be coming here very often, and the restaurant is wise to keep that in mind. As a result this is so much more than just dinner, it's an experience. And as experiences go this one was pretty memorable.

I look forward to returning one day with an empty stomach!"}
{"text":"Going to keep this one brief. Incredible space with incredible history and architectural detail. Well designed and awesomely decorated. The Art works alone are worth the visit including among them original Warhol's. Incredible sculpture -- lots to see. 

Great menu with good variety and the turf selections are outstanding - probably one of the best steaks I've ever had in Toronto. Service was excellent right from our greeting at the door to our servers to those who wished us a good evening as we departed. 

One small criticism is the choice of wines by the glass, unusually limited choice for a place of this stature, and the choices they had were mediocre at best. Still I highly recommend this place but bring your credit card cause you're gonna need it -- not inexpensive. But worth it!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to Casa Loma since I was a kid to explore the castle and I would have never thought spending over $1,000+ on a dinner for two was in my future either! 

Upon arrival we we offered valet parking which was $15 and coat check then we were walked to our table. The atmosphere of the place was really nice, we were seated beside the fire place in the dining room with a huge portrait of Prince staring right us (not going to lie, it's pretty creepy if you stare at him for too long)

They brought bread and crackers with a side of smoked butter and truffle oil to our table as we waited for our food to come. 

For starters, we got a dozen of oysters and I forgot the two sauces it came with. I believe one was a BBQ and I have no idea what the other one was. Really nice and plump, worth getting! 

Secondly we got the Blue Sturgeon Caviar which was a whopping $600 for a tin. It was served with mini pancake lookalike things that I totally forgot the fancy name for and creme. I've never had caviar before and the closest I've ever gotten to it would have to be the roe you get on your sushi so I didn't know what to except. It had a nutty salty taste to it and it was a good experience because they served it with the \"mother of pearl\" spoon that you're supposed to eat it with but didn't wow me too much. I don't get why rich people enjoy caviar...

For our main dish we got the wagyu sampler which consists of three wagyu steaks from Australia, America, and Japan and also a Canadian Dry Aged 12 oz. All the wagyu had different contents of fatty to it but obviously my favourite is the one from Japan. It simply melted in your mouth and had the highest fatty content compared to the other wagyu. The Australian one was also delicious but had an iron-y taste to it which I didn't mind. The one from America just tasted like normal steak. The dry aged wasn't too exciting either we could've done without it. As for a side we got the Asparagus which was cooked correctly and didn't taste bitter. 

Overall my experience here was lovely, staff was great and the place was beautiful. But the bill wasn't very pleasing to look at!"}
{"text":"As a foodie who loves fine dining and good food (legit don't mind paying stellar prices for good food), I still like a nice atmosphere and a nice vibe. While the steaks are good here, I found the atmosphere very boring. There was not much music in the background and for some reason the restaurant was pretty bright. I also found it odd that the kitchen was visible (not in a good way), and we sat right opposite it. Now, I definitely wasn't expecting an STK vibe here, but I tend to get very sleepy after eating a huge steak and having a few drinks - especially on a Friday night, after a work day. I'm not asking for loud music, but some music, and a lively atmosphere would be nice.

Now to the food - We had the 16 oz centre cut Striploin which was cooked to perfection ( had it medium well, it was yummy!). The portion was so huge that it legit took my friend and I two hours to finish the steak. I'd honestly suggest sharing the steak and then opting for sides, as they have a good selection, and looked really yum! The complimentary bread they gave was nice, as the waiter informed us that the steaks would take about 45 minutes, but I think it was out within 30 minutes. We didn't have space for dessert, but their cheesecake looked good.

The drinks menu is on a tablet, which is fun I guess? Wine list was somewhat extensive and very pricey. Cocktail menus were extensive as well and I opted for a cosmopolitan, which wasn't on the menu, but my waiter was happy to accommodate. I don't think they give tap water here, because our server served us with evian, without asking our preference e.g tap/bottled, or sparkling/flat.

Our waiter was very friendly, and even offered to give us a tour when we were done eating. However, he made a mistake in our order and we got charged for a more expensive steak. My friend alerted him of this error and he was happy to adjust the bill. Not sure if this happened to anyone else, but just make sure the server takes the right steak order. We actually ordered the 12 oz centre cut Striploin but got served the 16 oz version ( I kept wondering why the portion was so huge, LOL) and didn't realise this until the bill came. We felt bad not paying for what we ate, but didn't think it was fair to pay for the server's mistake. P.S I really like the waiter outfits with the suspenders :-). 

It's definitely worth checking out, and maybe I'll be back in the winter because it gets boring frequenting the same steakhouses all the time. It definitely also depends on the vibe you are looking for. If you want a very quiet dinner and have no festivities planned after, this place is for you. The restaurant is pretty new, so maybe there would be some changes/improvements soon."}
{"text":"We were seated in Drakes round booth and started with Caesar salad prepared at the table.  Then we enjoyed the BlueBlood sour, French onion soup, and fois gras.  Enjoyed the French Onion soup but Caesar salad was a lot better at Jacob & Co..

We had the porterhouse and Elgin bone in rib eye steaks, cooked medium, with corn, fries, mac n cheese, and broccolini.

Steaks were overcooked and just warm.

OK meal but pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"This place is amazing great food servers host we went on sat night family of 6 for my daughter birthday she loved her steak everything we had was super delishplus your dining in a beautiful castle great place to celebrate no rushing pushing you out no pressure to hurry super chill"}
{"text":"This is probably the most difficult restaurant to rate ever. Anyways, here goes.

The premise is that you basically get to dine in a castle. How cool is that? Definitely something I always wanted to experience so I made a reservation (3 week wait to find a suitable date for me). I've been to Casa Loma before but it was SO cool to approach it knowing I'm going to have a dinner there.

The staff was absolutely top notch. Doors were opened and we were greeted and someone was checking on us all the time in case we needed something. The decor inside is stunning and you absolutely feel super fancy dining here. If you want to impress someone this is the perfect place.

Was the food good? Yes. Was it good value for the money? Absolutely not. For appetizers we ordered ceviche, french onion soup and polenta squares. Ceviche, while quite tasty, was literally half of a scallop slided into 4 thin slices with 4 mango slices added to it. This half of a scallop cost me $22. Unbelievable!!

French onion soup was not bad, but rather flavorless. Polenta squares were quite good. For main I ordered Centre Cut Striploin cooked medium. It was quite good, but was it $60 good? No. It should be noted that to complete the meal, I had to add peppercorn sauce and mashed potatoes which cost me an extra $19. If you order a steak, you get literally nothing but the steak in the middle of your plate. No veggies, steak sauce etc. Hate to say it but you get the same at The KEG for less than half the price.

On my way out I looked at the bar on the other side of the restaurant and it looked stunning. Will I come back here? Yes - for some lighter meals and the bar for drinks. Dinner with an entree? No."}
{"text":"I'm torn about this place. The service was incredible. The venue is beautiful as you can imagine being inside a castle and all. The steaks... meh. We ordered the tomahawk and the porterhouse dry aged steak. They were mediocre and definitely over cooked. (asked for medium rare). The sides were great. Overall I was somewhat disappointed by the food but the experience of being there was pretty nice.

Forgot to mention we also ordered oysters and steamed king crab legs. Both decent but then again you can't really screw those up. Cocktails were great too. Would I come back? Doubt it. There are better steak houses out there especially considering the price point."}
{"text":"Absolutely stunning , from the art to the food and service .. highly recommend!!! Food is absolutely delicious and priced reasonably"}
{"text":"Eat in a freakin castle? Check

I'm usually not a big spender on food expenditures such as this but my oh my, was this worth the wait. Booking in a month advance once I set foot onto this place, I knew i was going to be in for an immersive experience. Immediately greeted by the hostess, we were seated right by the fireplace as this one of the many seating arrangements that is surrounded by high end well decorative decor in the restaurant. 

Onward to the main part of the review ... the food. The table side Cesar salad distinguishes itself as a good appetizer due to the homemade dressing sauce. The 30 aged Canadian prime steak ordered as a medium rare has got to be one of the juciest steaks I've had (and it better be considering the price that I'm paying).

Overall, would recommend to try this place at least once as Casa Loma remains to be one of Toronto's iconic landmarks. Be prepared to have a lighter wallet by the end of the meal"}
{"text":"While this place deserves 4 stars per Yelp's scale, I don't think it has trumped my go-to steakhouse in the city. Great service, good plating (especially when taking into account the showmanship for the table-side caesar and baked alaska). However, I think it is just a hybrid of Jacobs & Co. and Delmonico's in NY. The combination of ingredients and the dishes themselves, like the foie gras served with brioche and some kind of compote, the baked alaska, as well as the table-side caesar salad are familiar menu items from other steakhouses that unfortunately just feel like borrowed items that are not better than the places from which they came.

While it was an enjoyable meal, I don't think I will be back purely out of my own choosing (only if there's a company dinner or group event or something). Will stick to my usual steakhouse in the city."}
{"text":"I can scratch Dining In a Castle off my list :)
My wonderful boyfriend took me here for our anniversary since I'm a huge history fan and love visiting various castles. 
First off let me clarify the 2 star is for the overall food/price/value.. but if we're talking service, that's a solid 5 stars! Now on to our dinner:

The parking here is $10 ($15 for valet) which is kinda a bummer because you would think you're about to pay about $100 per person, you shouldn't have to pay to park the car. It's not exactly easy access either from public transport. 
You head in and are immediately greeted by small group of host/ess that take your jacket for you to do a coat check. They had a lovely spot for our romantic dinner. It was the sofa seats just by the window. Gorgeous looking room. Still can't believe that after all these years, it's finally been turned into a restaurant. Just wish they had better lighting because you can hardly see the food. I hope they realize that seeing the beautiful food can actually affect how we perceive the taste as well.

Our server for the night was a very kind young man that I thought did absolutely amazing to make sure we had a beautiful night. I just wish the food matched that quality. We started off with the complimentary bread which came with an interesting pecan butter and white truffle oil. 

APPS - we got the Steak Tartare in Bone marrow with pickels, etc. It came with 4 crostini's brushed with bone marrow oil. It did not taste really fresh or vibrant. I wish they got more creative with the ingredients they had. I felt, if anything, this was a bit of a waste for tartare and bone marrow. 

MAINS - keep in mind that in a steakhouse, many will just serve you the meat and you order the sides separately. We ordered the lamb with maple glaze and it was great! We're lamb people so of course we had to order it. I also ordered the Veal on bone and I think I was a bit disappointed. The meat itself tasted great around the edges where it had been slightly seared, but the fat had not been properly rendered down, so rather than a caramelized edge, I got a really just...fat.. raw tasting edge. The middle of the veal did not seem to be cooked all the way through either (ended up sick for the next 12 hours). We had asked for medium rare, but the middle was very transparently pink looking where it looks like it's JUST hit cooked. We couldn't really tell because the lighting in there is so incredibly dim. I felt sick about 1-2 hours after. 

DESSERT - Ordered the Earl Grey Creme Brulee... I can't help it. I love earl grey. I'm such a sucker for earl grey haha! THIS was delicious! Very heavy tea taste and beautiful spun sugar. 

Over all, it was a nice one time experience that I'm very very thankful my boyfriend took us to. I can definitely cross off Dining at Castle Loma off my list. I could see us returning for maybe the day time events or just to have a drink at the bar and some dessert. But I wouldn't see us coming for a full dinner. It's extremely over priced for a menu I don't feel justifies that pricing. I just strongly believe that any restaurant that can afford to source such beautiful ingredients should do the ingredient and the suppliers justice by being creative and bringing out the best flavours. They didn't really do much creative with their food and I've eaten at much establishments offering much better food at half the pricing. Wherever their food costs are going, perhaps it's time to rethink."}
{"text":"First off, dining in a castle gave a great edge to my dining experience. Our waiter, Sergio was very friendly and attentive. We ordered and split a 22oz Canadian Prime steak, accompanied by lobster mac n cheese and crispy kale. The lobster mac n cheese was delectable, and the crispy kale came with a delicious, zesty aioli. The steak was cooked and seasoned perfectly. To finish off our meal, we split a table-side baked alaska that was to die for. Overall, this castle dining experience made us feel like royalty!"}
{"text":"We make a reservation at 9:45 but we came early for 30 mins. They did not have any seat available for us to dine in early. So they brought us to the waiting lounge. Is @ the second floor of the restaurant. Is pretty nice and comfy (the sofa), but is really cold in the lounge. It seems like there's no heat here. 

In the meanwhile of the wait, I ordered a non-alcohol drink. They don't have any menu for non-alcohol drink but they will ask you what kind of drink you would like. I told them is hard for me to pick without a menu. So I told them I like something that is fruity and sweet (well...they asked me). Basically they surprise you, they don't tell you what kind of drink is it. Just drink it; it's pretty good tho. 

So we got a seat around 10:00 and we already know what we wants to order. (We saw the menu while we was waiting for the seat.) The food came very fast. And everything was prefect. But they did not give us bread. I was waiting for it!! The waitress said she will bring it, but end up she didn't. 

The best food of the day will be the Earl Grey Creme Brûlée. This one have a very strong taste of earl grey. Which it's good because a lot of place don't have that strong taste. I'm a big fans of dessert.

We did not order any drinks/coffee along with the dessert, but the table beside us ordered a coffee. And it's smell so good. 

After you pay the bill, they will offer you a salted caramel truffle (complimentary). It was so gooooooodddd!!!! I love it so much."}
{"text":"Great service, amazing ambiance. The castle itself is gorgeous. The servers and managers are on point with attentiveness. The bartender came by to make a specialty drink which was bourbon based infused with autumn. I personally don't eat steak but my dinner companion said it was tender and juicy. Tuna tartar is a must and you could do without the carpaccio which is 6 rectangle slices of wagyu beef. If anything you have to come here to see how beautiful the restaurant is."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I don't have enough pictures of this restaurant and the food we indulged in. What can I say about this place... it's a restaurant in a castle! Food was great and they add a unique twist to it by having a lot of table side foods prepared right in front of you including drinks (great for snapping videos). 
If you've been to Jacobs they have many of the same options on the menu (Jacobs is better) but it's still worth a go."}
{"text":"Dinner in a castle, it's a landmark birthday, family, who can ask for more? Well...............me. 

Atmosphere is 5 Star...... but I didn't just come here for the cool, hipster avant- guard interior design or the giant creepy Prince poster and other random perplexing art. I wanted to be impressed with a great meal. 

The starters were un-inspiring but enjoyable. The giant prawns are exactly that, GIANT! So meaty it was like a plump chicken leg with a Smokey seafood sauce. My main was a perfectly cooked PEI bone in steak. When you eat with your eyes, it's upsetting to see your dark steak on a black cast iron plate. Depressing to look at so thank the beef gods it was a beautiful cut. I guess that's why other steak joints are dark. 

There are some tasty sides like the cream corn and the polenta squares (beware they were a bit spicy). Lots of choices.  

What irks my palette here is the vino. The wine list is curated by the LCBO (local liquor store for out-of-towners). Nothing original and marked up 200-300% with no corkage option. We regrettably dropped over $650 just on wine.  

BlueBloods is a lot of hype in an amazing setting. Overpriced, but thankfully not over-cooked."}
{"text":"Great steaks, everything else is just okay. 
Apps: short rib ravoli - the clump of meat on top was good but the ravoli's were small and lacked taste
Sides: kale chips - very burnt and was a very odd side to eat with steak / lobster mac&cheese - lobster is fine but mac & cheese very dry and flavourless

Overall the vibe is pretty cool but we felt it was not as refined as a true 'fine dining' venue (e.g., dessert menu had food spots on it) and felt slightly 'trying too hard'."}
{"text":"When I heard about a restaurant opening up in Casa Loma, my ears certainly perked up. And a steakhouse at that. So when my husband ended up taking me here for my birthday, it was was nice surprise.  
Upon arriving, the grounds immediately drew me in. It's just so beautiful. The restaurant uses the side entrance of the castle and they have setup a reception area which then leads to two dining rooms, one on the left and one on the right, both just at the opposite end of the conservatory. The left dining room has a gorgeous bar at the back that is truly an eye catcher. We got seated at the right dining room which was just as lovely. We took an early seating so it was not too busy when we arrived but by 6:30 it was full and bustling. The dining room has big windows that lets in lots of light during the day/late afternoon and after the sun went down, they dimmed the lights and created a romantic cozy vibe. The banquette seating was pretty low but the table was pretty high so it was a bit awkward at times while eating. You can't rest your arm on the table like you normally would as the table comes to mid chest and I'm not a short person. 
FOOD: I started with a cocktail that was fruity and had a little ice tray with raspberry and blackberry floating on top of my drink. It was unique and the drink was refreshing and fruity which I liked. We then ordered the table side caesar salad for two which is one of my favorite caesar salads to date. I could have used without the whole anchovy sitting in my salad though. It was slimy and off putting. But the bacon bits, the crouton, the freshly made dressing totally made up for it and I loved the salad. 
Next, we moved onto the mains. We wanted two different steaks to share so we opted for two different textures. The first was the Nebraska filet and the second was the American Wagyu Ribeye, both medium rare. I found the filet to be very lean but very tender. The medium rare was good for this cut. The ribeye was so juicy but I could have done with a medium for that, just cause I like the fat to be totally melted but it was more medium towards the ends of the steak so really, not a big deal. Very flavourful, totally recommend these two cuts depending on what you like though. We also ordered the scallops to share which my husband really liked. I thought the sauce was excellent but I'm not a scallop person to begin with so I wasn't crazy about the dish. The scallop was well seasoned and cooked though. It wasn't rubbery. I really enjoyed the sauce. It had corn in it and was interesting. I could have lived without the popcorn on top of the dish though. Who puts popcorn on a refined scallop dish? It didn't score any points for taste or presentation, and this is someone who absolutely is crazy about popcorn!! But it has to make sense and this dish did not. 
By this time, I was pretty full but my husband wanted dessert so we took a look at the menu. There was about 5 choices and we opted for the caramelized banana crepe for two. It was also made table side but we waited about 15 minutes or more which seemed really long. And this dish I could have lived without the table side assembly. The crepe was pre  made, the caramel sauce was made table side, with some bananas thrown in, crepe, and then topped with fresh squeezed orange. The taste was okay but I had better, and parts of our crepe was burned even though the sauce wasn't caramelized yet. So execution wise, it didn't go so well. I think if it was done in the kitchen by the kitchen staff instead of our server it might have been better. 
SERVICE: The service was attentive at the beginning but not as consistent once it got busy. There were also water and crumbs on our table after the main meal but no one wiped it like they normally do in a traditional steakhouse. It's still a solid positive experience though. 
PRICE: You can expect to pay about 300-500 after tip and tax for two people depending on what you order. The place is not cheap but the value is there for the cocktails, and the steak, both of which I thought were made exceptionally well. 
Overall, the food and drink was really enjoyable and the atmosphere is oh-so-romantic! You can also take some really lovely photos inside and outside the restaurant while you are there to capture the experience."}
{"text":"My wife and I always enjoy fine dine in the city of Toronto and this was no exception. So she decided along with my son and his GF to treat me to a Blue Bloods Casa Loma dining experience for my Birthday. Super ambiance and service and great place for dining with the most attentive staff.  Excellent choice of steaks from the finest meat producing countries, however I must admit somewhat ridiculously overpriced, both on the Turf and on the Wine selections. Bottle of very fine Decoy 2013 California Carbenet Sauvignon for $260, which you buy at the LCBO for $64.26, ambiance and service certainly does not condone slapping on a price tag which is over 4 times the regular retail price. Be prepared to dip deeeeeepppp into your pocket as a fairly nice meal for 4 could set u back approx $1200. Observing Quintin create the Baked Alaska table-side was pretty cool and worth the show. Absolutely delicious desert! I would admit that notwithstanding the bill, I absolutely enjoyed the company the meal and the experience!!"}
{"text":"BlueBlood's expansive selection of steaks, including Wagyu from across the world, is more impressive upon a glance at the menu than in practice. 

The meat is fine - but not nearly as good as some of the best spots in the city, even though they are priced as if they are. 

The service here was, at best, apathetic.

If you're looking for a great steak, check out any one of the numerous spots across the city, including Jacob's."}
{"text":"One of the nicest restaurants (if not the nicest) in all of Toronto. Their bar is very well designed and very interesting drink selection. It is extremely expensive however, most notably the wine list. You can always tell how expensive a restaurant is by their wine list and the mark ups. They mark up bottles 3-4x LCBO costs which is outrageous. To give you reference tedeschi amarone is about $40 at LCBO. Here? It's $160...."}
{"text":"EXPENSIVE BUT NOT SPECIAL

I attended BlueBlood 2 days ago for my birthday dinner, which my wife had arranged weeks in advance with great anticipation.  When you go out for a $500 birthday dinner you're laying on the Ritz, and you expect the restaurant to do the same.  Unfortunately, that didn't happen.

When we arrived, a hostess gave us a quick but nice tour of the adjacent portion of Casa Loma.  However, when it came time to be seated we were handed off to another hostess who started to walk us to our table while we still had our coats on.  We had to ask to check our coats, and their process of taking and checking our coats was disorganised and awkward.

We were seated in the smaller of the 2 rooms, the first room in from the entrance.  The room is visually attractive, with a large baronial fireplace at one end and high vaulted ceiling.  However, the lighting was turned down so low that my wife couldn't read her menu.  And the tables are crammed in so tightly that you can hear the conversation at the next table.  

My wife had twice requested, well in advance, the table for 2 beside the fireplace but the Restaurant wouldn't confirm either request.  When we arrived, we found that the fireside table was occupied and we were seated at the table farthest from the fireplace!

In anticipation of a birthday dessert (which didn't materialise, see below), we skipped the appetizers and went straight to the main course.

My wife had Cornish hen (which our waiter referred to as \"chicken\"), sweet potato fries and asparagus.  She described the Cornish hen as good and the sweet potato fries were excellent, wide cut and wafer thin.  However, the asparagus stems were large and somewhat woody.

I had an 8-oz centre-cut filet done medium rare, with duck fat kennebec fries and a side of sautéed spinach with quail egg.  My steak was properly cooked and tender, but it had little flavour and it was the smallest 8-oz steak I've ever been served.  My fries were excellent (they seem to be good with potatoes), but the spinach was a soggy mass sitting in water.  I ordered Béarnaise sauce on the side for my steak, and it was watery and flavourless.

We shared a Caesar salad for two, which the menu said was to be prepared \"tableside\".  That's always fun, and we were looking forward to it.  However, the tables are packed so tightly together that the salad chef couldn't get his cart beside our table, and we were left as somewhat distant spectators while our salad was prepared in the middle of the floor, 8-10 feet away, closer to other tables than to ours.  The salad was mediocre:  far too much white lettuce with a dressing that was thin and too lemony.

Presentation of fine food is a large part of both the attraction and the enjoyment.  The pictures posted by the restaurant looked appealing, but reality was disappointing.  The dishes are black and the mains are served sitting in the middle of an empty plate because the sides are all served separately. So I had my little round filet sitting naked without even a sprig of parsley on the plate.  And the lack of visual appeal is exacerbated by the low level of light and the black dishes; my charbroiled (black) steak sat alone in the middle of a black plate and the sautéed spinach was a greenish-black mass in the middle of a black bowl.  Not visually attractive!

My wife had alerted the restaurant that it was my birthday, and they had told her they would acknowledge the situation appropriately.  We took that to mean the usual little birthday cake and the wait staff singing Happy Birthday in the usual good-natured way.  So we passed on dessert and waited, but nothing happened.  Finally, after 20-30 minutes killing time and sipping wine, it became clear that my birthday wasn't going to be acknowledged and we departed, without any birthday celebration and without dessert.

Overall, a disappointment, especially at this price point!"}
{"text":"No more visits for me. 

These guys just can't do one thing right, and it's the main thing - getting their steaks cooked right.

Not sure what's going on here, but if I wanted a burnt filet with no sense of apology for the interruption of dinner, the awkward waiting, and the cold sides, I wouldn't pay as much as I was at BlueBlood. 


6 months, three visits, three overcooked steaks. Real shame."}
{"text":"This was quite an experience. If you want to be treated like royalty in similarly suited location, then this is the place for you. 

The restaurant is obviously very beautiful, set inside Casa Loma, the feeling is high end, luxurious and over-indulgent. We were seated at one of those round tables in one of the more historic-looking rooms, it was quite comfortable and it seems like most people are here to celebrate something, as this is certainly not an everyday, casual restaurant.  

The service was excellent. It's kind of an art to achieve the type of service we had, it was subtle and we almost never noticed when the server came by to fill our glasses or clear our table. He was helpful, engaging and so quick and prompt with requests while also somehow staying in the background and not intruding in on our conversation. I think this is truly good service, sometimes I find servers almost too eager and friendly that it comes off as intrusive, this is the opposite but in a good way. 

The food is where one star gets knocked off. Honestly, everything was delicious, but the portion sizes were a bit lacking for the prices. We ordered a few appetizers, including the table-side Cesar salad, the French onion soup, the beef carpaccio and the shrimp cocktail. The Cesar salad was a real spectacle to watch. Someone in our group has a fish and seafood allergy and since they make the dressing right in front of you, they were able to omit the anchovies and Worcestershire sauce which is a nice option. For mains, we had the tomahawk steak and a rib eye to share, along with a few sides, fries, gnocchi, asparagus, and the creamed corn. The tomahawk steak was delicious and cooked nicely. I didn't try the rib eye but I heard it was just ok. I found the sides to be all good but I just don't think there's any value in them at all. They were all around $16 or so and they were meager portion sizes. I would say they're shareable among two people if that, there were about 5-6 big fries per order and maybe 6-8 asparagus spears to give an example. They were tasty but not really worthwhile. Same with some of the appetizers, this is the epitome of those big fancy plate-small portion characteristics you see at high-end restaurants. This is a steakhouse though and I think something like fries should be decently plentiful. I suppose you really do have to anticipate a hefty bill when you come here, it's not a cheap or even moderately priced restaurant by any means. Lastly we ordered some desserts, the lemon meringue pie dessert was my favourite, I also tried the creme brûlée which was really good and the trio of desserts which was beautiful to look at but I found there to be too many sickly sweet elements that didn't really mesh together very nicely. I might opt to skip dessert and just enjoy that diamond shaped truffle they give you at the end of the meal, which was a nice, charming touch. 

Some other notes, parking is $10 for self parking, I think $15 or so for valet. I think they can probably afford to do free parking for the restaurant, most groups are probably spending over $100/person so that would be a nice touch. 

Overall, I think this was a one-time experience. If you have the spare change, I'd say try it once for an over-indulgent experience. It really is a beautiful restaurant with great food!"}
{"text":"Come for the ambiance. The original Warhols and the Dali sculpture . . . Wow. Fireside dining, excellent sommelier who decants your bottle. My steak came out undercooked but they took it back, not an issue. Salts served with the steaks are right up my alley. Table side Cesar was fantastic. All sides were very meh (lobster Mac and cheese, mushrooms, skip for sure). Highlight food wise of the evening was the  ricotta cheesecake. I'm sure I'll be back at some point because it is so lovely, but food wise, stick to Jacob and Co for high end steak. Or even Morton's is better."}
{"text":"3.5.  A decadent experience, but too many missteps and a high cost mean I likely won't return.

Atmosphere:  the dining room is gorgeous - from the ornate ceiling to the overly-luxurious leather chairs.

Service:  from the moment you walk in, the staff make every effort to make you feel special and catered to.  

Nevertheless, there were a few surprising errors.  Twice, I had to ask for my bread plate to be removed, and a Manhattan ordered \"on the rocks\" came straight-up (nothing egregious, but surprising, given the overall cost).

Food:  the French onion soup was rich & full of home-cooked warmth.  The lobster macaroni & cheese was superb.

But, you're here for the meat, obviously.  The cuts were almost perfect.

However, I ordered the centre cut sirloin rare and had to send it back, to be warmed up.  It had been served almost cold.  Not the centre (which can happen, when you order rare), but the whole thing.

Cost:  $500 for 2 people.  That included two cocktails, one bottle of wine, two appetizers, and two mains (warning:  the mine markup is sometimes 450%).

And - disappointingly - the restaurant tolerated an impromptu photo shoot, with two heavily plasticized, very young tourists.  It went on for almost an hour - complete with a tripod (?!?) and multiple, intrusive camera flashes.  Food untouched."}
{"text":"\"...While waiting for our drinks, we perused the menu. Executive corporate chef Michael Ewing and his team did an excellent job highlighting various cuts of the beef from around the world as well as fresh seafood. The Wagyu options from the U.S. Japan and Australia immediately caught my attention. A six-ounce American Wagyu filet mignon was $90. The sticker shock only got worse with a $200 six-ounce A5 filet from Kagoshima, Japan. I was anticipating a meal fit for a queen.

A hot minute after our Prosecco popped, the server asked if we were ready to order. We hadn't even decided--we were too engrossed in conversation. He came back a few minutes later and his incessant urgency to speed things along made me anxious.

As the centerpiece of our meal, we each chose the eight ounce centre-cut filet from Green Bay, Prince Edward Island. We started with the Castle Kale salad and rounded out our filets with two sides: sautéed broccolini and polenta squares.\""}
{"text":"We decided to pay a visit on the back of hyperbole-driven raving review of my friend,so expectations going in were high. Maybe a bit too high.

The setting is beautiful. Vintage leather booths, antlered chandeliers, the whole of eating in a stately setting such as Casa Loma is an experience in itself. I would say a little too dimly lit but very elegant impression nonetheless. Wait staff were efficient, direct, attentive, and stoic. Our first bite consisted of the complementary bread/brittle with a very addictive paprika butter. But that's not what I was there for.

Now---steak is my Achilles' heel. In particular, ever since having my first wagyu experience, opportunities to sate my desire fell far and few between---as such, I was very much looking forward to this place ever since laying eyes on their menu. The most recent experience was the Michelin-starred CUT of Singapore and as it was similar priced would really set the bar for expectations.

Naturally, I went for the Wagyu Filet tasting (Australian MB9+, American Mishima Reserve, Kagoshima A5 from Japan; 4oz of each), medium rare. Let me just say first that plating was a no-fuss, no-frills approach with three steaks bare on a cast iron plate---while I understood that that may be the intention, I felt without garnish it was very naked. Even the sides such as the gnocchi and the foraged woodland mushrooms were garnished and plated in a cute little saute pan. Especially in stark contrast to the beautifully presented short rib ravioli (which was delicious by the way), the bare steaks just felt anticlimactic. All the steaks exemplified the hallmark succulence, buttery melt-in-your-mouthfeel, and overall piece of heaven that Wagyu is known for---the A5 the most so---yet distinct from each other. We were offered three different finishing salts (lava, Himalayan pink, and smoke) which I felt compelled to use extremely sparingly lest I accidentally mar the flavour. While my craving was satisfied, I felt the Wagyu experience does not live to that of CUT. Might be just my addiction escalating but it did not blow my mind nor did I feel that the price point was justified given the quantity and quality.

Overall, a very fancy-pants type of experience with excellent food that fall just short of its exorbitant price tag. Perhaps a date night or social gathering if you don't mind or can afford the aftermath of the cheque."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed. The seats were dirty. The server's don't have much etiquette. The food was alright I guess. Table side Cesar salad was rather small for that price. Other steak houses have the same option with much larger portions and better flavors. I would say ambiance is great because you are after all eating inside casa loma. It's a nice view, but the place is rather noisy."}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?? 

The steaks! Being a steakhouse, you have to try the steaks. They have wagyu beef too. 

I opted the rib eye steak from Erin Ontario. I like fattier steaks but I think I'll try their dry aged steak too because they have aged steaks which I had and dry aged steak which is dry aged so that the flavours of the steak are more concentrated even though the steak may not be as juicy. 

I really liked the decor of the restaurant. Especially since it's located inside the casa loma castle, it makes the experience extra romantic. Soaring ceilings, ceiling to floor windows and comfortable couches and chairs make up the dining experience extra special. 

The appetizers were not bad either. We ordered the steak tartare and the tartare came out in a hallowed out bone. The foie gras was fatty and huge too so it was enough to share with two ppl. 

The baked Alaska was also very special because they make it table side. Comes as a flaming dessert, inside there's some ice cream layers with lemon sorbet and cake. Very delicious!

Last tip?!

I'd also recommend trying the Caesar salad too. Unlike other restaurants, the waiter/waitress makes the Caesar salad dressing from scratch right before your eyes! Another restaurant I know who does this is Jacobs. I liked this restaurant because they also serve heated empty plates to keep your food warm while you enjoy your food on your own plate! You can order one steak and share if you don't have an appetite to eat a 16 oz steak by yourself! That way, the steak will come sliced for your party to enjoy."}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant the food is great, Service is excellent & the atmosphere is unbelievable. The steak is cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"I gotta start off this review by saying this place is gorgeous. The restaurant is divided into two \"halves\" with one side looking more classic with wooden paneling and plush seating, and the other being more modern with a seafood bar and white marble. I was seated in the latter. 

Now for the food. We ordered quite a bit:

- Tableside Caesar: 
I was expecting so much more from their \"most popular appetizer\". We were seated by the windows and it's about 3 steps up from the ground floor. Unfortunately, this ruined our experience as we couldn't even see the person making the tableside caesar salad without doing a crazy Exorcism head twist because the guy was at the foot of the steps. I guess he was too lazy to carry up that wheely tray up the 3 steps? Also, the salad was loaded with a good 2 inches of parmesan cheese on top, and the croutons were stale and hard AF. 
1/5 

- Australian Wagyu Filet Mignon (6 oz.)
This was pretty good, but my only qualm was that the centre was really cold. I had ordered medium rare but that didn't mean the centre of my steak should be an ice pop? 
3.5/5

- American Wagyu Rib Eye (10 oz.)
My partner ordered this and I kept stealing it. It was hella good. Also, how often do you see Rib Eye Wagyu on a menu? Definitely the highlight of our meal. 
5/5

- Sides: garlic mashed potatoes and broccolini
The garlic mashed potatoes were SO good. Broccolini was alright. 
4/5

- Cheesecake
I had originally wanted to order the baked Alaska but they had actually surprised us with free cheesecake as it was my partner's birthday. That was a nice touch but the cheesecake itself was nothing remarkable. 
3/5

So here's the thing, I'm torn about this place. The food was decent, but it's the service that really makes this place outstanding. They not only gave my partner a free dessert, but also wrote him a birthday card on behalf of the whole restaurant. Super sweet. That being said, for the hefty price tag I expected more from the food.

Also, I have been to Jacobs before and between the two, I think I like the service here better but the food at Jacobs more. I may come back here someday, but only if someone else foots the bill."}
{"text":"Holy hell, this place is amazing. Worth absolutely every penny. You are treated like royalty the minute you step into the restaurant (taking the name Casa Loma to a whole new level), BlueBlood is definitely a high end steakhouse that will require you to dress up fancy and important like the big ballers. 

Coat check, check; friendly, comfortable, and knowledgable waiters and waitresses, check; comfortable seating, ...not check, but hey, with how amazing the night went, I can sacrifice seating for a bit of pleasure in other areas - my palate in this case. The lighting was also a little too dark for my liking, but that's okay (at one point I joked about not being able to see the food I'm eating if it gets any darker than it already was). 

I ordered the 12oz filet mignon ($90), medium done, and while I detest anything that's not cooked well done, this one was an experience I wouldn't mind going for again. The steak came with three different salts and my favourite was definitely the maldon smoked salt. The meat was tender and melted on your tongue the second you put it in your mouth. So satisfying, my tastebuds were flying up in cloud 9. I also ordered the tartare on bone marrow ($26) which was honestly what filled me up before I got my steak. For an appetizer it really was a lot to take in, so good!

The scallops ($36) were raved over by the waiters and our neighbours sitting next to us, and my friend said it was pretty good too; I must get that next time! My friend also got the onion soup ($16) which was pretty good by his standards and he doesn't actually like onions much. 

For dessert, we shared the baked Alaska which came with an impressive presentation of burning the syrup to pour flaming liquid over the dessert. For a good second or two, the entire baked Alaska was engulfed in blue flames, it was really awesome! The actual dessert wasn't amazing but it was decent nonetheless. I think for the price it came as ($28 for two people), it was more on the presentation that flavour, which was a bit disappointing. 

You get a complimentary sea salt dark chocolate at the end of your night! For dark chocolate it was a bit too sweet for my liking, but nothing beats free food, so I'm not complaining. 

One thing that confused me was the bathrooms. It's at the end of the grand hall but the ladies and men's share one room that is divided from left (women's) to right (men's). I only say this because for newcomers it can be a little confusing. I thought I walked into the men's washroom because the ladies before me were flustered about not reading signs right. There are also no mirrors in the individual bathroom rooms. There's a giant one outside but it felt kind of weird checking my teeth for ugly things right in the open. 

I'm so in love with this place, I've already made a second reservation to come back! Definitely worth the bill."}
{"text":"After waiting a couple of weeks I finally got a second to visit this iconic location and steakhouse. 

I was trying to make reservations for weeks to no avail, showing nothing available at 8pm on a Friday. I get it, new restaurant, hi demand. As we arrived I was a little upset that I had to pay $10 to park. With the prices they're charging, shame on them. 

As we were graciously greeted upon arrival and since we didn't have reservations, we opted to sit at the bar thinking that the restaurant would be full and busy. There were several or should I say many empty tables. 

Either way we ate and drank at the bar. The food, drinks and service were actually very good."}
