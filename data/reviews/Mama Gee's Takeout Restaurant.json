{"text":"Mama Gee's is the real deal. My husband brings home takeout often. My experience is always good. Authentic Ghanaian food, well-seasoned and spices for the traditional pallet. Waakye, okra soup, plantain, red-red all yummy and plentiful for the price. Did I mention the fried  tilapia?! Yum. If you drive past it is a hole in the wall but Mama Gee's cooking won't disappoint. I believe she does some catering too."}
{"text":"Legit, hearty, spicy homemade Ghanian food.  A great value - the portions are very generous.  I tried both the Jollof rice and the Waatye, and both were delicious.  Call ahead if you aren't the patient sort - they are making each dish when ordered, so it isn't fast food."}
{"text":"The best West African food in Charlotte hands down.

I've tried many many restaurants here in Charlotte and have been very disappointed. I was taught how to cook some of the best West African food at a very young age and I've been searching for those flavors since I've moved to Charlotte 6 years ago... Now that time has arrived and I'm super excited."}
{"text":"I genuinely enjoyed my experience with Mama Gee's. My parents make fantastic Ghanaian good so the standard is high for me. I was not disappointed. I was honestly reminded of food I had from a street vendor by my grandmothers house in Ghana. Great flavor. Called ahead and when I got there, my food was ready. I will definitely be back to try something else."}
