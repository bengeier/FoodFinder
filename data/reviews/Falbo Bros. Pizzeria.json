{"text":"For delivery service that's set up for the late night crowd I would not recommend them. Called at 1am on a Saturday night and got \"Falbos of Middleton, were closed\"
I will still stop by and pickup slices at random hours with my work but won't expect anything past that."}
{"text":"We ordered Falbo Brothers last weekend and had a wonderful experience. I ordered a cheese-less thin crust for myself and a stuffed deep dish for my fianc√©. The person on the phone was very helpful. They even gave us a few bucks off the order! My no cheese pizza came loaded with lots of toppings! Perfect! The stuffed pizza received rave reviews!  We were told about an hour and it arrived in 45 minutes! We will be ordering again!"}
{"text":"I was visiting from out of town, and this joint was across the street from our hotel. We ordered a small deep dish pizza with pepperoni. A bit more expensive than we're used to at home, but not of of line at $14. It was a very good pie. The crust was just ok - - I prefer a flaky, buttery crust with deep dish. Everything else was good - -  plenty of delicious, robust sauce, good pepperoni, a nice amount of cheese. And it was larger than I anticipated for a small. 8 solid slices. We placed an advance online order, and it was fulfilled accurately (unless they have me too big of a pie). Delicious, convenient, and worth the money."}
{"text":"Stay away from the Chicago-style deep-dish/stuffed whatever, it is a rip-off joke preying on the desperation of those who have had Chicago pizza for real from Lou Malnati's or Gino's East.

The thin crust works as a lower end quick pizza fix, once again there is much better to be had, especially outside of Madison. Pizza Brutta is a much better choice for those stuck in Madison.

Go to Chicago for a pizza vacation and see what real pizza is, then you will know what you've been missing, and at least could then judge if pizza is truly good or not."}
{"text":"I tried the deep dish pizza.  I've never really eaten deep dish pizza so I can't say whether it was good or bad.  As far as pizza, it was fine and I didn't have any complaints.  Crust was good, cheese was good.  Not outstanding or anything, but good.  

BUT

Way too expensive.  The thing was tiny, basically enough to feed 2.   And it came to like 14 bucks."}
{"text":"I had an experience very similar to Collins. I ordered a deep dish but got thin crust with a hat. When I called to ask if I got the wrong order she assured me it was deep dish and asked if I knew what that meant. I do but they certainly don't, especially when compared to the quality deep dish that the other Falbos in Madison serves.  

In addition to not getting a deep dish (that costs significantly more BTW) it took forever for them to prepare it. I actually had to call after an hour to see if they had forgotten about it since I was told it would be 35 to 40 minutes. 

I was really looking forward to their opening since I love the Falbos on Park Street but I sadly have to recommend avoiding this one."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the Madison area! Thick and thin crust are both delicious pies and great customer service every time!"}
{"text":"I keep giving this place a try, as I did today because no where else was open Christmas Day, but it's just not that good. I have a very particular pizza order - thin crust, lots of extra sauce, very light cheese, square cut. Nothing difficult, but not standard. The only pizzas I've ever gotten from Falbo Bros are an inedible level of greasy for me. Apparently they don't care much for special orders or requests, because I have never had them honored. Too bad, because the crust is interesting, but it's made so soggy by the cheese grease that it ruins most of it. If you're looking for grease, this is your place. Me, I think I will stick to Glass Nickel where they make my pizza to specification every single time."}
{"text":"The best pizza in Middleton.  The ingredients are top-notch (try the pesto!) and the deep-dish crust is absolutely addictive; doughy, thick, and solid enough to hold all the toppings without breaking a sweat.  The thin crust is also quite good.  The pizza is never too greasy (unless, of course, you've gotten five meats and extra cheese), which is a major plus.

The breadsticks are excellent as well.  Buttery, sprinkled with Parmesan and cooked to perfection.  Falbo Bro's doesn't have the same wide selection of appetizers as, say, Glass Nickel, but all of their appetizers are solid.

You can also get subs, salads, or Falzones (get it!?  Falbo's Calzones!?) but why on earth would you get any of those things when you can have this godlike pizza?

Delivery is efficient and I've never had any problems with the attitude of the drivers.  The person taking the orders is always friendly as well, but it's too bad that they don't have online ordering for this location.  The only other negative is the price; it's a little high for a place that's not striving to be \"gourmet\" pizza or whatever.  However, that's not enough for me to take off a star.  I've never been disappointed with the food I've gotten from Falbo's and they will always be my first choice for delivery in Middleton."}
{"text":"The pizza was delicious. The sausage had such hearty flavors! Disappointed about not receiving sauces and side items when being charged for them though. Hmm!"}
{"text":"Delish! We tried the deep dish pepperoni. I am usually a thin crust fan, but I really enjoyed this deep dish because you could taste more than just the crust and it wasn't dry. It could've used a tad more sauce, and it was a bit on the greasy side for me (hello - it's cheese and meat, of course it'll be greasy). All in all though, very good pizza! I plan to go back often."}
{"text":"I love their thin crust.. Their version of a stuffed pizza is pretty nice.. And while I understand its hard to mess up chicken strips, they seem to come out perfect every time.. Occasionally I will get a pie that's a little over cooked for my liking otherwise they would get the 5 star!

Try a thin crust meatball pizza with black olives.. Thank me later :)"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Madison.  Most flavorful sauce and most unique crust I have tasted.  Most important thing: they use REAL pizza ovens and never skimp on toppings or cheese.  A great value!"}
{"text":"Great pizza. Worst service ever! The employees do NOT want to be working there. When you call (which I do regularly as I live so close), it is like they don't want to be a business and make money. If you have a chance to go elsewhere, I would, and just because of the service."}
{"text":"Everything about this place has went downhill.  Used to love the food, but not anymore.  My husband really wanted food from there, so we ordered carry out.  Not really wanting to eat there, I ended up ordering a sub.  The girl who took my order asked if I wanted the meal with fries and a drink.  I stupidly decided to do that. My husband gets home with no drink. I called them back and apparently customers are just supposed to know to go into their cooler and grab their own drink.  If that is the case, why do they ask you what kind you want when you order?  This may seem like not a big deal, but this is the third time in a row my order has been wrong and it's mediocre food at best.  My advice? Take your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Greasy pizza. Definitely something that I don't normally get. The few times I've been here, it's because there were no other options. After finishing a piece, you're left feeling guilty and greasy. The people who work here too don't seem the happiest, but the food is the main issue."}
{"text":"The pizza here is greasy, not well made, and the whole vibe is just \"off.\" Definitely wouldn't choose to come here under most circumstances. There is so much better pizza elsewhere."}
{"text":"Wow...just ordered from here and the guy on the phone seriously needs to learn how to take an order properly. Never asked my name or confirmed my address. I even had to prompt him to ask what I wanted!  I understand that they can pull it up by phone number from caller id...but you always confirm!  People move, numbers are reassigned, etc., etc., etc.  Get it together man...its not a hard job. I worked in a much busier full service Italian restaurant with delivery when I was in high school. I managed to expedite and take orders and did a million times better then this guy. Get your act together. He also got part of my order wrong...so good thing I made him repeat it back. Hopefully its right when it gets here!"}
{"text":"A very rude young lady just dishonored a coupon by saying that it was pickup only which was never stated on the coupon.  Basically told me she didn't want my business.  After being a loyal customer for years I'm done."}
{"text":"Here is the deal with Falbo's

Don''t expect any, and I mean any, customer service. Expect to call and have the person on the other end of the phone be rude and inattentive. Also, always have exact change if you get it delivered, Falbo's drivers are known to not carry change. 

That being said, their pizza and salads are boss. This is a working mans pizza (food not price) and damn it is good. The salads are also amazing and generously portioned. 

If you can put up with the attitude, falbo's is worth every penny."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to get some classic slices. You don't go to this place for the service or dine it (I mean really is a place for pizza and a bunch of guys making it) It's a simple place to get some delicious pizza or go grab a few slices. Take out is the best way to go or the slices. I've been going to this place since high school. Dash some oregano and enjoy. Also their Arizona ranch is a nice choice."}
{"text":"Friendly service good thon crust pep n sausage"}
{"text":"There are few things that can go wrong when you give a drunk man a pizza and a side of breadsticks.  Whatever shortfalls a pizza may have are typically ignored in the drunken feeding frenzy or drowned out by copious lathering in ranch sauce.
Falbo Brothers has performed an amazing feat by producing a pizza so vile and foul that not only could I not finish a single slice, but I was nearly brought to vomiting by the mere sight of my brother taking bites of this sewage-inspired cheese pie.

TL;DR: Worst.  Pizza.  Ever.  Inedible."}
{"text":"My girlfriend had told me how great this place was, so we gave it a try. We ordered a deep dish cheese  pizza and a greek salad. 

The pizza was phenomenal. Tasty crust, ample cheese, delicious sauce. 

The salad was the disappointment. After my girlfriend talking for months about this being her favorite salad, it was a mess. I give points for it being fresh, but there were barely any toppings. The pepperinchi were banana peppers, there was very little feta, etc.

We ordered late so I'm hoping they were just out of ingredients."}
{"text":"I ordered a medium pizza, a small bread sticks and a salad.  For the quality- $40 (w/tip) was far too expensive.  The pizza (which I paid more for deep dish) was just a regular pizza with a really tall, dry crust.  The bread sticks were just a plain pizza crust, dusted with some dried herbs and a powdery cheese product.  They came with a side of very cold marinara.  
I can't comment on the salad- because I never got it. We got delivery, and the driver literally pushed the boxes into my hands, and ran off before I could tell him I was missing an item (I am not blaming the driver- it was a Saturday, and I am sure he was very busy).  
The pizza was fine- greasy with an unpleasant crust, but not terrible.  The \"bread sticks\" were awful- dry and flavorless. There are enough decent to good pizza places in the area that I see no reason for me to order from them again."}
{"text":"I'd eaten Falbo's since college in the '90s, but I hadn't had it in years. \"Let's give it a shot,\" I told my husband, and we got a hand-tossed pepperoni and picked it up ourselves.

It was just as I remembered. The cheese was stretchy and generous, the sauce was slightly sweet, and the pepperoni was greasy in that amazing pepperoni way. Hands down, this is STILL my favorite pizza in Madison."}
{"text":"Used to be good. Seems to have gone downhill quite a bit. Most recent order was not delivered. Restaurant had been paid online, so they made no effort to call me when they said they tried to deliver it. They seemed not to care when I called. 

This used to be our favorite pizza place in Madison. This isn't our only bad experience."}
{"text":"There is no doubt that Falbo makes great pizza, but their service is terrible. Ordered a pizza during a time of day that shouldn't be all that busy and it took two hours and fifteen minutes for our pizza to arrive. We called them after an hour and a half and they told us that our pizza was out for delivery. Forty five minutes later the pizza just arrived."}
{"text":"Already left a review for this business. Thx. I love this place good food all the time, staff is not short stop'en either, meaning very good staff!!"}
{"text":"I've lived in madison for sometime and this place has by far the best pizza. The choice of sauce and cheese they use is amazing. There cheese sticks are one of my favorite."}
{"text":"Very good ingredients, plentiful and evenly placed. Their mozzarella is delicious. The sauce is good but I wouldn't say spectacular. I don't like a lot of sauce anyway.

I always get thin crust because the deck ovens they use give it that nice toasted crispy tasted on the bottom that you just can't without a well seasoned deck.

Love me some Falbo's!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went late hungry for pizza. They were open. The pizza was out of this world. So tasty , plenty  variety of choices. The service was great. And we found out they will deliver to us in a different town. Now who does that and deliver any time. I'm thinking football season."}
{"text":"No stars... I ordered a pizza from Falbo Bros (N. Sherman Avenue) in Madison last July. The usual-- thick, dense, not good gluten free crust . Very dense. I ordered another one on October 7th. Same deal. I ordered another pizza from them on October 20th and was shocked by the crust-- light, thin, not dense, and it was AMAZING. But, it was too good to be true-- my boyfriend (non celiac) tasted it and said it tasted just like his regular crust.

I emailed the company that night and asked them if they had changed their crust recently. I told them if they had not changed it, that their kitchen had made a very serious mistake and needed to be much more careful in the future. They emailed me back on October 22nd saying they'd changed it and asked if I liked it. Of course I did-- it was amazing.

So... I ordered another one on October 23. (PS: I am recovering from major surgery so I have been ordering in more than usual.) October 23 was again, a wonderful crust-- and my boyfriend said it tasted just like his. My skin was itchy and I spent a lot of time trying to figure out where the gluten poison had come from but figured they had no reason to lie in the email and certainly, they would not have made the same mistake twice.

We had a coupon so last week, I ordered TWO gluten free pizzas. Amazing, wonderful pizzas. And I ate them both. And, my skin was itchy, my skin developed deep infections, and I really started to wonder where on earth I was getting into such horrible gluten ingestion. And as with any celiac, I got tired because I was unable to absorb my nutrition properly.

I really didn't believe the pizza thing... so I set out to order some gluten free home test kits. In the mean time, we ordered pizza Monday night for the Packer game... and what should they deliver but their old, usual, dense crust gluten free crust that tasted horrible.

I wrote them a scathing email-- that they lied about a recent crust change (they had the same crust in July), that they did not ask their kitchen to be more careful, that they charged me extra for gluten free, and that their careless and negligent attitude could seriously sicken someone with severe celiac (though, no celiac would order a gluten free pizza from a gluten kitchen, I am sure.)

No email back after I called them out on it.  Email copies available upon request.  Will do no future business with them after their careless attitude about gluten allergy."}
{"text":"I can't say that this is my favorite pizza place in Madison, that goes to Pizza Bruta, but Falbo's is in my top 5 and has become my go-to place for delivery.  I wasn't bowled over by their crust but their pizza was very flavorful due to their use of fresh topping and the absolutely most delicious mozzarella possible all without being overly greasy.  Plus they have a good number of veggie options on their menu.  I'd recommend pesto, spinach and mushrooms."}
{"text":"Madison's best pizza. I have never had it delivered, which seems to be a complaint reading some reviews here,  but the quality of the PIZZA is top notch and they always take care of me and do a good job with my order. I pick up for my family of six at least a couple times a month."}
{"text":"Ordered the Tree Fungo pizza with broccoli. The pizza showed up 80 minutes after ordering and was missing the sausage and broccoli. Not a great showing. This seems to only be a problem for the north side Falbos."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza, came later than projected by about  15 minutes, pizza was cold and thin crust was mostly burned on bottom.   One and only time ordering from Falbo."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza, great quality and price compared to other places in town. I would highly recommend the Mac and cheese pizza along with the Falbo cheese bread!"}
{"text":"Never eating here again. I bought wings and a sandwich and the next morning was spent missing work because I couldn't leave the bathroom. Vomiting and other things. Save yourself."}
{"text":"For me, Falbo's has always been a trip down memory lane.  During my time at UW Falbo's was always the late-night pizza of choice for my roommates and me.  When I was a freshman I remember walking to their old University Avenue location to grab a slice for lunch.  As I continued my storied and distinguished college career I always seemed to be in proximity to Falbo's.  For two years I lived a block away from the Park Street location.  There were plenty of nights where I'd come home at bar time to find my roommates playing PS2.  They'd call in an order and then give the money.  I'd go pick it up so as to not disturb their video game.  Our arrangement was great, and I don't think I paid for pizza more than a couple times over those years.  Fast forward a few years: I'm out of college and working for a living.  There are no more bar time nights or roommates, well at least no roommates.  I've even moved out to the suburbs.  But imagine my surprise when I realize that there is an outpost of college nostalgia in Middleton - a Falbo's not much  more than five minutes down the road.  

I was first clued into this shocking development a couple months into my first apartment in Middleton.  A friend from college was in town and couch surfing at my place for a week, and after one Thursday night at the Boar we stumbled back to my place and he wanted to order a pizza.  I told him that I didn't know of much in the area, just a Domino's and Buck's, but I improvised and grabbed a phonebook from the pile in the lobby.  I didn't believe it at first, but the Falbo's guy confirmed that they were in fact located in Middleton, at 12 & Century.  Thirty minutes later we had our pizza and it was great.

Falbo's pizza is the gold standard for what I consider \"college pizza\" - thin crust pepperoni & cheese, delivery late into the night.  My tastes have grown since college and I prefer the specialty pizzas at Roman Candle and Picasso's to the old pepperoni & cheese standard, but it's hard to go wrong with the delicious simplicity of a well-made pie.  The best aspects of Falbo's are the thin crust and the cheese.  The pizza is never too greasy or soggy.  Over the last few years I don't believe I've ever ordered anything but that old college standard, pepperoni & cheese, and although I know they've got a big menu I've never really delved into it.  If I ordered delivery more often then I'd probably know more about what they have, but almost every situation has been one where a friend is coming over or is staying and I want to order something quick and simple.  Falbo's is perfect for this, and if I've got the time I can run over there for pick-up and save a couple of minutes.  I don't think Falbo's is the best pizza in Middleton - I like Roman Candle for this.  But Falbo's is the best for quick and fast delivery, and for me recalls some of favorite memories of my college years."}
{"text":"My delivery order was placed over the phone, but I got their menu via Allmenus.com. I called at 3:12pm, and was immediately asked if I could hold. I agreed, and then they set the phone down on the counter, and I could hear everything! Three minutes later (not too long), he came back and I ordered our pizza, along with cheese sticks. I was given my total, and told it would be there in 45 minutes because I got stuffed pizza, and it takes a bit longer to cook.

One hour and 15 minutes later, my fiance' asks me again how long they said it would take, and that is generally my cue to call them back and see what's up. I call back, am immediately again asked to hold, I said \"well, it's just about the order I just placed, I'm wondering where it is\". Their response was \"Let me get a manager\". Five minutes later the manager gets on the phone, and I let him know that they're 30 mins late. He apologizes, doesn't offer to comp anything, and tells me he should be there any minute.

10 minutes later, a knock at the door. The driver asks me if I have a pen (that doesn't happen very often - very disorganized), I sign, and let him go.

I open up the cheese sticks, and it's a hoagie roll, split in half, with cheese and herbs on it. It wasn't cut up at all, and SO not worth the $7 paid for it.

The pizza was a buffalo chicken pizza. I enjoy buffalo wings A LOT, and we generally enjoy buffalo chicken pizzas as well. The buffalo sauce on this was SO spicy that my fiance' couldn't handle it. Honestly, if you go to a place like Buffalo Wild Wings, I'd rank the sauce near their spiciest. If you're going to use a sauce that spicy on a pizza, there should be a warning, or do something to cool it off by adding ranch dressing to the pizza as well (Glass Nickel does this, and it's wonderful).

In fact, we promptly ordered 1 pizza from Glass Nickel, and the pizza was here and hot in under 20 mins."}
{"text":"My star rating is given purely on my ordering experiences over the phone with these guys. I've never seen the store in person. I've ordered delivery twice so far and they seem to be on top of the game. Courteous and casual staff. Perfectly cooked pizza with good thin crust, wisconsin cheese, and quality  topping. For delivery pizza in Madison, I prefer Falbo's over Glass Nickel and Pizza Pit - I think quality is noticeably better. Delivery times have been an hour or less, no mess ups on delivery instructions or food."}
{"text":"Best damn pizza attached to a gas station I've ever had! Go Falbo Bros!"}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza. This place was one of the only businesses open during the blizzard last week. Our order for 3 pizzas, cheesy bread and salad was only missing the salad. No biggie. Any driver that can get through 19\" of snow and bring the group decent food is ok in my book. Thanks for keeping our stomachs full during the crazy weather."}
{"text":"Terrible. Pizza's decent but delivery and service are terrible. Quoted 45mins to an hour for delivery, after an hour and half we called to find out where our pizza was. Got hung up on the first time I called and when they finally answered, the guy that answered told me he just got there, didn't know what was going on but our pizza is on the way... interesting since you apparently have no idea what's going on. Asked to speak to a manger and was told he would have to call the manager on duty to see what 'he could do for us'. Never got a call. Completely unprofessional and disrespectful. We will never order from Falbos again."}
{"text":"Love this place, every time we order it's consistent, fast, anytime we have a minor issue they are happy to take care of it. I really love their sausage it's delicious. The salads are wonderful, always big and have plenty of ingredients."}
{"text":"I love Falbo Bros.  I have ordered from them many times and the thin crust pizza is always great.  They don't skimp with toppings.  I ordered for delivery at 6:30 on a Saturday night and it was a my house by 6:50.  Fast and tasty, exactly what you want from pizza delivery."}
{"text":"We decided stop in to have a slice or two.  The dining / waiting area was completely filthy.  The floor was covered with a variety of dead bugs and garbage and the two small tables were sticky.  I like their food at their other restaurants but will never go back to the Monona location."}
{"text":"I have ordered delivery from the northeast location 2 times now. Both times I waited over an hour and a half for the food and both times they got the order wrong. Once is one thing but twice in a row is just a bad restaurant. Won't be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"I ordered a deep dish pizza expecting deep dish pizza but instead received what amounted to pan style. When I called to ask about the mixup I was informed that this was their version of deep dish. Making the crust an inch taller than the pizza does not make it a deep dish. The pizza was cold and wasn't the style I wanted so needless to say this was a bad start. The flavor was OK but not what I would expect for the price. The cheese sticks were equally disappointing. They were about 90% dough with a thin layer of cheese and no real seasoning to speak of. In the future I will be sticking with Salvatore's, Anna's, and Glass Nickel."}
{"text":"First time here. I think they are little pricey however it's the best pizza I've had since being in Madison. The cashier was friendly and was thankful for the patronage.
I got the deep dish pizza with a ton of meat. The bacon was real and the sausage was like crumbled jimmy dean. It was amazing!  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Goodish pizza. Yep, gotta go with identifying 'potential.'

Crust options are either thin, stuffed, or ??? (something sounding fairly Chicago-style-ish, which, in that that's not actually pizza, but a level of hellish hockey puckish pie-ish-ness meant to be avoided by anyone not just looking for something to soak up  booze), the last of which I am unwilling to qualify as food at this time.  But even those descriptions seem to have a hell of a lot more within-class variation than between-class variation (stuffed crust aside) given my experience.

Thin crust wasn't really anything I'd call thin crust (brick oven or otherwise) - if I had to call it, I'd say it was usual (literal) thickness for NY or New England regular pies, but that the dough wasn't given enough time or attention to become a truly nommy by-the-slice NY pie or one I could have ordered for 8$ in Meffa' or 10$ in Cambridge.

Delivery is notoriously unreliable (or, at least, irregularly very delayed only considering orders made in fair weather), so have stuck with takeaway this spring during my visits to the area.  With takeaway, orders weren't necessarily started until after the pickup person arrived  for pickup a half hour after ordering (2 of 4 orders).  Anyway - the wait was fairly quickish, I guess, once on site for pickup.

All in all, it's a fair bet if you're committed to keeping expectations low and liking what you get."}
{"text":"They need to offer a complementary vomit bag with each pizza purchased.  This can't be their best effort, but if it is, then it's time to close up and move on to other ventures."}
{"text":"Not thrilled with this place. I placed an order at 1030, was told 30-45 mins delivery time. Called at 1130 to check the status of the order and was told the delivery guy left 10 mins before I called. About 10 mins later the delivery driver called to say he was about 18 minutes away still. Finally got our food at 1205pm. The food that should have been hot was cold and just average. Probably will not order from again. If you are going to offer delivery - a wait time that is 2x over what you quoted is not acceptable."}
{"text":"They told us a 45 minute wait for our take-out order which was fine. It was supper time and I'm sure they were busy. After 45 minutes I walk down and am greeted by an extremely unfriendly employee who told me the order hadn't been processed and made up some excuse to the extent of \"well I thought you were super pissed about the 45 minute wait and weren't coming so we never made your food.\" He was extremely rude to me like it was my fault and said we can make it all really fast and it'll be out in 6 minutes. After another 10 minutes we finally got it.  
Rory, another fellow, made it all okay and was a cool guy. 
This one star is for poor and rude service. They're food is still great!"}
{"text":"Over 2 hours for a pizza when the stoned staff \"forgot\" to put our pizza in the delivery system. I bet Pizza Hut could figure out how to deliver a pizza on time."}
{"text":"Had a stuffed pizza and wasn't impressed in the least. Firstly, they forgot my toppings and just gave it to me plain - I let it slide, since they forgot to bill me for it as well. More importantly, every ingredient in the pizza sucked. 

The crust tasted exactly like some half-assed bread I made earlier that day out of nothing but water and some generic yeast and flour. The tomato sauce was clearly tomato paste that came straight out of the can, perhaps mixed with some garlic powder or dried oregano to give it just a bit more flavor. Finally, the cheese just wasn't up to Wisconsin standards. It tasted rubbery and greasy, like prepackaged string cheese.

For what I'm paying, I might as well be getting pizza from a good, reliable place like Glass Nickel. $15 for a medium? I could get something of the exact same quality from Domino's for a third of that price."}
{"text":"I don't like to give single star reviews--and honestly, I'm debating between one or two stars--but this was a one star pizza if I've ever had one.

I ordered a pizza at work through GrubHub for delivery. It arrived about 45 minutes later without any major issues there.

When I opened up the pizza, it looked promising. I remember someone commenting that they definitely didn't skimp on the toppings.

I wish they would have.

This thing was so overloaded, undercooked, and oily that we needed to use a spatula to separate nearly raw pizza dough from the cardboard box it was delivered in. Those who picked middle pieces basically got a handful of cheese and toppings.

That's irritating."}
{"text":"The thin crust slaughter house pizza is amazing! Never had a bad pizza from here and I've always gotten great service too."}
{"text":"Ordered feta fetish.  I don't taste any feta, which is not enough to satisfy any sort of fetish.    The crust is burnt black on the edges and spots on the bottom.  The cheese bread didn't come with sauce.  Not the delicious quality I expect from Falbos. Sad sad face."}
{"text":"Our Department at work ordered Pizza today and it took over 2 hours to get from Park Street to off Pflaum road. When we called to check on it after an hour, they said \"this is normal\" really? what? funny, 5 minutes after we called, came the email that \"your pizza order has been received\" You would be better off saying \"ooops, you know we are really busy and it was misplaced\" then to lie and say it is normal to take over 2 hours to deliver a pizza ! 20 minutes after the email, came the pizza."}
{"text":"Love, love, love Falbo's!  They have the best crust.  Crispy, crunch, yummy.  Their sauce is tasty, too.  

Thin crust, cheese pizza.  Nothing is better."}
{"text":"What happened? The place is filthy. When you walk is the first thing you see is the dust and fly traps on the red duct work. The counter, floor, walk is is all disgusting. Hand prints, crumbs, dirt, where is health services? Wow this place went down fast.."}
{"text":"2 times I've come here and 2 times they've screwed up the order. I walk and not a single condolence was made for making me wait. 30 minutes each time. Screw these guys, they don't care about their job or their customers. While waiting I overheard the manager treating the workers like crap. Your the manager, it's your fault if the place has consistent problems, not everyone else's."}
{"text":"Have had consistently good service and food here.  Love that they have slices in the evening (most places it's only lunch time) and they make cookies like my mom makes...so that's awesome."}
{"text":"Falbos Pizza is a great at what they do.  Making pizza.  If I asked them to make an alternator work on a 2008 pontiac G6, they most likely couldn't do that.  They do pizza as advertised, and not to mention they're just about 6 blocks away from me, which makes delivery quick and painless!   I've also picked up the pizza and found the gentleman behind the counter to be nice and helpful.  It seems working there is his second job, yet he acts like it's just as important as his first job.  

If I was a badger, or even a wolverine there is no way I could be writing this review.  I assure you I am a real live human being.  Just ask my girlfriend!  She likes the pizza too.  I'll let you come down here and snap my suspenders!*



*DON'T TOUCH MY SUSPENDERS!"}
{"text":"I order a 25 dollar pizza and get this? 50% of the toppings aren't even on the pizza.. The box was destroyed by how much grease there was.. Falbos is the epitome of the saying this is why we can't have nice things"}
{"text":"I will start off by saying that ordering a whole pizza is expensive, but in this situation the price and product match up completely. I've not only never had a problem with their food or service, but I would say that their pizza is definitely worth it. Best in Madison? No I wouldn't go that far but it's definitely good. I gave this pizza place three stars because in my personal opinion it's pricey. At least mine was. One pizza could be anywhere from $20 - $25 so that's definitely a lot for one pizza, but the pizza is definitely good. The order times can be spotty at times and the My order has been wrong once, but this doesn't warrant a non recommendation from me. It's just something to keep in mind when you order. I haven't been to the other locations but as far as the Monona location goes, this is probably the strongest out of all of them from what other reviews have indicated."}
{"text":"Slow delivery, poor order accuracy, and subpar customer service.  The food is good, but not worth the hassle.  There are plenty of other pizza places in Madison.  #failbo"}
{"text":"reminds me of that Chicago pizza & even the north beach in San Francisco. Definitely will be coming back fast friendly service and delivery !"}
{"text":"I've been ordering from this Falbo Bros for several years. 95% of the time the food is great. Their thin crust pizza with the traditional sauce are great, even with only veggies. Most of their cold sandwiches aren't much to look at, but are really good. Reliable delivery service. If you love pizza, you should try one of their pies."}
{"text":"I've been ordering two or three times a week for about a year. They have really been going downhill.  The food has been arriving cold and they screw something up on every order. I called them and they are so very rude, even to a regular customer.  I'm done. There are too many places in Madison to put up with it. I guess they haven't grown with their business. I don't know what the problem is; but I'm moving on...

{"text":"Picked up an order from this joint last night. I had the Hepher sandwich (roast beef) toasted.  It was really good! Nice portion size, tomatoes were fresh, the meat was high quality and tasty. My mom had a Falzone with olives, pepperoni and extra cheese. It looked amazing though I didn't taste it. She enjoyed it. Her only complaint was that it was too salty. Of course it was salty! Refer to her choice of ingredients...
Service was fast and friendly. A solid choice for sure."}
{"text":"This was the absolute worst dining experience I have ever encountered in Madison, WI. 

To start, after ordering what should be a \"Deep Dish\" pizza, I received what was the most flaccid of pizzas I could possibly imagine. The only thing that even slightly resembled a deep dish pizza was the height and angular degree that the crust took. A deep dish pizza should not be able to be picked up and eaten as if it were a slice of frozen cardboard pizza from the grocery store. What I received was not worth the $25 that I paid for - it should have been $14 at the most.

Next, after calling the store to express my concerns over the state of my pizza and whether I had or had not actually received the pizza I ordered, I was met by the most inconsiderate and lippy employee in the entire state. This snarky phone operator began his instigations with informing me, the customer, that he didn't have time for this and that maybe they would be able to call me later that night. At one point, this employee actually began to yell into the phone that he had been \"making deep dish pizza for 5 years and this is what it has always looked like.\" I then wondered if he even knew what a deep dish pizza was. 

I have never been met with worse service and a lack luster, overwhelmingly disappointing meal than I was at restaurant. I have not written a review before despite some terrible experiences, but I was prompted and went out of my way to do so after my encounter with Falbo Bros. I DO NOT recommend for anyone to even consider this as a viable eating establishment."}
{"text":"Oh Falbo. How I love thee, let me count the ways.....

1. You are quality pizza, every time. 
2. You are a great value. I do not mean you are cheap but you are quality without being pricey.
3. You make great thin crust. It is not cracker thin. It is what thin crust should be.
4. You do not get my order wrong.
5. You have great staff, EVERY time. 
6. You are easy to get to.
7. You keep your word on when my pizza will be ready. 
8. You remind me of home. Just good Chicago pizza.
9. I can get a single topping pizza and be completely happy. They have AH-MAY-ZING sausage. 
10. You complete me."}
{"text":"I  called and placed an order for delivery. Should have took hint that service was bad after calling twice and being hung up on. I heard good things from hotel staff,, where I was staying. Took over an hour for delivery, when I was literally 5 min away. The pizza was over cooked and dry with little flavor. There version of the calzone was like a hot pocket with no cheese. The boneless wings were okay, but charged dollar for blue cheese, which I assumed was included, since they asked me if I wanted ranch or blue cheese. The Italian beef was like a microwave sandwich. When food finally came, it did not include napkins or utensils, which have always been included with orders from many other establishments. All in all, crappy service, food and price."}
{"text":"They came in to my office about 15 min before my lunch break to drop off some free samples. I had one slice and ordered the BBQ Chicken Thin Crust Pizza for my lunch now."}
{"text":"The guys here are nice and once in a while I'll stop in to pick up a quick slice. I ordered a pan pizza for delivery recently and the crust was undercooked. It was mostly cooked, with little doughy sections. When that happens it's sorta like, comeon guys, how many pizzas do you make a day? Quality control."}
{"text":"Hmm. Not sure how to review this. We never actually got to taste their food, but I'm sticking with the one star.

We called on a Wednesday night, around 7:45pm, and tried to order a pizza with our own toppings: spinach, broccoli, tomato sauce. Unfortunately, they said \"sorry, we're out of broccoli.\" We substituted with mushrooms. Good to go, right?

Nope. Pick-up would be an hour. WHAT? Apparently, they were extremely busy on that day and time. They very well could have been, but this steers us away if we ever wanted to order pizza on a more common busy night, such as Friday and the weekend."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Madison! Friendly service, always willing to accommodate your needs. They also have fantastic appetizers... made fast! Check out the chicken tenders and their famous \"Arizona Ranch\". Every so often you can catch a coupon that makes this establishment even more impressive. If the bright neon signs don't draw you in, the delicious smell will! Late night hours and fast delivery are a plus as well. Thanks Falbo's! Keep your pizza tables spinin'. Shout out to Berlin who hooked us up on our last visit. We will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Nothing fancy, but great pizza!

This was my husband's and my favorite pizza place throughout college and med school.  There are no frills, just honest to goodness down to earth pizza.  We have always loved their thin crust pizza with mushrooms and pepperoni.  The crust is thin and crusty, and the tomato sauce very good (and my husband is VERY particular about tomato sauce).   Their stuffed crust pizza is even better!

We probably haven't had it for about five year since we now live outside of Madison, but I picked up a pie on my way home last week, and it was JUST as good as we remembered it :)"}
{"text":"Great delivery option while staying at The Sheraton! Hot delicious pizza and fantastic salad. Perfect if you are feeling the craving for pizza!"}
{"text":"I'm not one to write a negative review but wanted to share a terrible experience I had eating their pizza. I had a training near the south side and they ordered from this place. I can't share anything about the customer service other than the delivery was prompt, but the pizza experience I can certainly share. Now, the cheese pizza was just ok but good enough to want to eat a couple of slices. Later that evening as I was just about to get ready for bed, I had a terrible gag reflex and rushed to the bathroom where I ended up not only vomiting once, but 5 total times throughout the night. Y'all I had FOOD POISONING, my body was aching, I was feeling nauseous, and I couldn't sleep at all. It was so bad I had to call off work and one full day of recovery is still not enough to get me out of bed. 

I'm absolutely positive it was their pizza because I hadn't eaten anything after my training. So all in all, I'm pretty sure it was either the cheese or something in the pizza that was contaminated. I've had food poisoning ONCE in my life before and thought that would be the end of it, but nope I was definitely wrong. Be careful of what you eat from here as there's a possibility it could happen again."}
{"text":"I ordered two pizza and a salad through All Menus from Falbo Brothers. This was one of my favorite places to order pizza from. The last time we ordered a taco pizza we got bbq sauce with it instead of taco sauce. This time after an hour had past I called to make sure they had recieved my order. The guy who answered the phone set the phone on the counter (no hold button) and left it laying there for five minutes. Upon his return I inquired about my order, he told me it was just coming out of the oven. I live maybe 5 minutes away from the restaurant. My pizza arrived 45 minute later cold and burned all over the top and crust of the pizzas. With All Menus I included the tip in the original purchase price. I paid $45 for two burnt pizzas and tipped 15% for HORRIBLE service  Time from order placed(5:20pm), to pizza arrival (7:10pm) 1 hour and 40 minutes! EXCELLENT!"}
{"text":"Great cheesy beefs with giardiniera.  Outstanding pizza.  Chicago style for sure.  Prices are on point.  Easy on-line ordering presence.  Solid, friendly staff.  I've ordered here at least a half dozen times over the past 2 months.  These guys knock it out of the park every single time."}
{"text":"This place might get my vote for Madison's best pizza.  Their deep dish is definitely the way to go.  The mix of cheese that they use for their pizzas is superior to the cheese used by all other pizza places in the area.  All day special of $4 for two slices and a soda is awesome, although they don't always have fresh slices since most people order whole pies.  Decent cold subs and awesome hot subs.  Being open until 3am or later every night is also a huge plus."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving Falbo's 4 stars and not 5 is because, (like many others mention) the costumer service really lacks. We're new to the area and this is by FAR the best pizza we've had in Madison. But just know, when you call to place your order, it's like talking to a burnt-out who can't comprehend what you're saying. Talk slowly and repeat. I don't even think they asked for a name on the order. Haha, all in good fun, who ever makes the pizzas is freakin' amazing. I've had both the Hawaiian Chicken and The Mason and they both were soooo good. Amazing flavor, good crust. Can't beat it. We ordered the Italian Stallion tonight.. Can't wait to eat it!"}
{"text":"The double-decker Chicago-style pizza is a winner!  The sauce is fabulous and it's cooked beautifully.  Well done!"}
{"text":"Not impressed.   I'm traveling and it's snowing in Madison.   I want delivery to the hotel.  First off...the guy who answered was an ass.  The fryer was off so no wings at 9pm.  Oh well...  I ordered a thin crust pizza and got a regular.  I ordered a bottle water and got a can of Sprite.  WTF?  How hard is this shit?  Listen to my words, write it down, make it and deliver it.  Pretty simple.  Try another place.....don't waste your time ."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of delivery pizza, but buy it nonetheless as a single working mom of two.  With that said, Falbo's is not bad.  Not bad at all.  I personally think their regular default crust is perfect - not too thick and not too thin.  They don't get all cheap on the cheese toppings either like some other places where you feel like you just bought a flat round piece of cooked dough with some sauce and a few shreds of cheese.  My personal favorite, however, is the Toni Falboni Salad (with extra cheese).  So good!  Their housemade Italian dressing is that perfect tangy, herby topping for a gigantic pile of crispy salad with yummy meat and cheese toppings.

Falbo's delivery time can stink - we've waited a lonngggg time, had to call to follow up, etc.  My annoyance goes away quickly when they show up though, because their delivery drivers are always so friendly, funny, apologetic, and genuine."}
{"text":"Loved these guys.  Drove across country last month and ordered delivery from our hotel.  They had great pizza, gluten-free crust, and the delivery boy was a sweetie.  I'm not sure what more one could ask."}
{"text":"2 hours to get a pizza on a weekday evening because they somehow lost my online order.  When it did arrive, it was greasy and flavorless.  The sauce was bland and canned crap.  An extra star because my delivery driver was nice, but there's really too many better options (Salvatore's Tomato Pies, Ian's, Glass Nickel. Pizza di Roma) in Madison to eat this crap."}
{"text":"SLOW delivery times. We got our pizza 1.5 hours after ordering and it was cold. So I can only judge the pizza on the reheat - microwaved Falbos is slightly better than a frozen pizza."}
{"text":"I was really excited to see a stuffed crust deep dish pizza...in Madison. I was so disappointed. The crust through out was definitely not cooked enough. I stuck it in the oven for 30 minutes at 350 and still raw dough! I heard good things on the thin crust, but not sure I will order from here again."}
{"text":"Best Pizza in town! Get the deep dish!"}
{"text":"Full Disclaimer:

I have been eating Falbo's since they first opened when I was in College.  My Senior year, I actually lived right above it when it was located on the ground floor of La Ciel.  Coming in after bartime to see what pizzas were ordered but never picked up was a pasttime. (cheap eats).  Maybe it was the constant wafting of pizza goodness coming through my windows but I have been a fan since Day 1.  Fast forward almost twenty years (yikes!) and the pizza still delivers.  While I am a fan of their thin crust, I feel their stuffed pizza is sublime.  My order is simple:  Stuffed pizza with banana peppers and pepperoni.  Take home and douse with Tapatio or Valencia hot sauce.  Consume enough to feed a small army.  Repeat every few months.
Yes, the service can be gruff.  The location on Park St. is almost non-descript.  But these are small prices to pay for great pizza."}
{"text":"This place has some okay pizza but the pricing is mediocre at best and it does not keep well overnight. It's not amazing though."}
{"text":"My first experience with another Falbo Bros. store years ago was not good. The pizza tasted good, but I was sick the whole next day. Because of this, I've had an aversion to eating there, but since it's my boyfriend's favorite pizza in Madison I decided to give it another try. I'm glad I did!

This time around I went for their Falzone (which is, as you can probably guess, a calzone) filled with chicken and garlic. Some pizza places make you feel ridiculous for having chosen garlic as a topping (\"No, I'm super pumped I just paid $2 for a teaspoon of minced garlic I can't even taste with the other toppings! Worth it!), but Falbo Bros. used slices and it was definitely present. The chicken was tasty and found in nearly every bite as well. 

I also sampled their cheese sticks, and while it was a bit of overkill with the calzone, it was still tasty and I'd keep them in mind if I was ordering a salad or sandwich. 

The Monona location seems to be primarily a delivery and takeout operation - we didn't see anyone dining at dinnertime and the counter is all you can see from the storefront. Our order was ready quickly and traveled home well! I ate the leftovers a couple days later and those also held up after being refrigerated and microwaved."}
{"text":"Really good, greasy pizza.  However, in a town full of truly great pizza (Glass Nickel, Ian's, and Roman Candle), Falbo Bros is just a late night stop.  It is what it is."}
{"text":"I have been there 2 times for Lunch and got a slice of Peperoni and a slice of Sausage it was good but could have used a little more pizza sauce but I will go back as it as fast in & out and good pizza."}
{"text":"I ordered a salad and cheese sticks. Both were absolutely delicious. Will definitely be eating here again. The prices were reasonable. The food was delivered from Grubhub and it came with the hot food hot and the cold food cold."}
{"text":"after a few beers at the mason lounge, we stopped into falbo bros. and ordered a pizza for carry out. there were only three of us in the store but for some reason it took forever to get our order. their pizza is decent, but they need to speed it up."}
{"text":"I had only eaten pizza from Falbo Bros (which is pretty good BTW) until I recently discovered their excellent hot sandwiches. My new \"go to\" is the Raging Bull. Their Chicago Style Italian Beef sandwich with au ju is delicious. Their boneless wings were crispy and flavorfull as well."}
{"text":"Unimpressive, to say the least. Not distinctive in any way. A lot like Di Giorno's frozen pizza only more expensive.
The owner is a CPA who should have stuck to book keeping, because he's clueless when it comes to food.
In a town with too many pizza joints, this one needs to go away."}
{"text":"Not impressed. I have ordered from Falbo twice before and each time has been mediocre at best. Tonight I order the Hawaiian bbq chicken pizza and am disappointed yet again. The pizza had little to no cheese. It was prepared with a thick layer of lunch meat chicken beneath the thin layer of cheese. The quality of the meat wasn't good but more importantly the menu description did not accurately describe this type of pizza. Had I known it would have a layer of gross lunch meat and barely any bbq sauce or cheese, I would not have ordered this. Will not be ordering from this chain anymore."}
{"text":"They have forgot a few ingredients from time to time when I have ordered from them. Their calzones are fabulous. They are huge and only $6 and their chicken parm sub is delicious too. I really like their onion rings but once I ordered half a pound and they gave me 1/4 and then when I called them they said, \"Oh you wanted wings!....Oh onion rings?....Yeah we weigh them before we send them.\" They sent out new ones. The store itself is disgusting. I don't recommend dining there, but having them deliver to you is great."}
{"text":"The best....period! 

Thin crust, mushroom and cheese, extra well done so its almost bunt cut into squares."}
{"text":"We've been looking for a go-to pizza place since moving here nearly a year ago from California.  We've tried the usual suspects, and although we haven't been completely unhappy with those joints, we also haven't been blown away by them either.  Then we tried Falbo Bros.--YUM.

Now before anyone starts going off: no, this isn't gourmet pizza.  No, you wouldn't find this pizza in Italy.  No, this isn't classical Chicago deep dish.  But you know what?  Their pizza tastes good.  The dough isn't greasy or oily.  It's really just a vessel for the tasty and fresh ingredients that they load onto their pizzas.

We ordered one thin crust and one deep dish (and on a side note, what's up with Madison hating on pan pizzas?  It's either thin crust or deep dish out here).  Both were topped with delicious mozzarella, delicious meats, and fresh vegetables.  You could really taste the freshness of the ingredients.  Very good stuff.  And I don't think that it was too expensive either--you gotta pay for good quality pizza.This is probably the best pizza joint in Madison... better than the places here crowned king by the public.

Yeah, that's right.  I'm calling you out Glass Nickel and Ian's.  Whatchu gonna do?  Kick me out of the city?"}
{"text":"My pizza was burnt. I mean charred so badly that it was inedible. Called the store and was told they \"thought it was a bit dark but probably fine.\" Didnt offer to deliver a new pizza or refund my money. Never even apologized. No manager working, but I could call \"Andy\" and he \"might answer.\" Are you kidding me?! I used to order from Falbos consistently, but absolutely never again. Will be sure to discourage my friends as well."}
{"text":"So if you're drinking at the bar next door and you think to yourself, \"Hey, I should go next door and grab a slice of pizza,\" know that this is subpar pizza at best. The pizza does have potential.  It may, despite other poor reviews, be a great pizza place in the daytime, but since I grabbed a slice at 11 at night, I just got the \"Hey, it's late and people will be too drunk to realize it's not fully cooked pizza\" but, one scotch on the rocks doesn't have that effect on me. I'm not drunk yet.  I don't know if the picture shows it, but the dough/crust is severely undercooked.  The flavors are there.  The sauce was good and there was even a fair amount of cheese that melted as the partially cooked pizza waited for me to purchase it, turning and beckoning me from beneath the heated lamp. I only wish the heated lamp had coked the dough as well as it melted the cheese."}
{"text":"The establishment is a little dingy and outdated, but don't let that stop you. Super tasty pizza, especially the sauce. Also, the alfredo bacon cheese bread is a MUST!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Madison, and for a good price. One of the latest open joints in town. Skip the stuffed and go with their own style 'deep dish'"}
{"text":"The last two orders were unacceptable. The food was burnt ,
The pizza was dry, edges were also burnt. I have no choice but to find a more consistent and better Pizza establishment..."}
{"text":"First time customer here and really enjoyed our pizza. The deep dish crust isn't what you would think if you're used to the Chicago style pie. It's thick, but still airy and crispy on the outside. Very tasty. The toppings are plentiful - we had sausage and roasted peppers and loved it. The guys working there were friendly and care about their craft."}
{"text":"I was a little concerned about ordering pizza from a place that is attached to a gas station, but I have to give credit where credit is due, the pizza is GREAT! They also make pretty good salads and wings. We struggled to find a go-to pizza delivery place in Madison for 3 years, but now we always turn to Falbo Bros."}
{"text":"After a long day on the road, I needed to feed my pack of ravenous children and fast.  I'll admit - I did not have the highest expectations as I journeyed to Sun Prairie to pick up a pair of pizzas with my restaurant.com certificate clenched tightly in my fist.  But you know what; those Falbo Bros. pizzas I picked up were actually pretty decent.  While they were not at the exalted Salvatore's or Grampa's level of greatness, but they provided an enormously satisfying pizza feed for the kiddos and myself.

The ordering process went smoothly - I placed my order over the phone and the person call repeated my order to confirm they had the right order.  She also applied some discounts to my order, even though I did not have any coupon codes.

The tiny strip mall storefront is not well marked - I drove right by it initially.  This is definitely more of a carryout / delivery operation with only four small tables inside the restaurant and not much in the way of dining ambiance.  However, the interior appeared clean and well maintained.  As I paid for my order, the cashier asked if I this was my first visit (it was) and gave me a $5 coupon for my next online order.

I was ready to tear into the pizzas after enjoying the fragrance of freshly baked dough and fresh tomato sauce during the short drive back to Waunakee.  When I popped open the boxes, the 12\" cheese pizza certainly passed the eye test.  The cheese topping extended almost the edge of the pizza and the crust had that wonderful brown leopard spotting.  The crust had a satisfying chew - I believe Falbo Bros Pizza uses a fair amount of olive oil in their dough recipe to give it a degree of richness.  What it did not have was any sweetness, so they did not use sugar to speed up the fermentation process.   

The well-seasoned sauce tasted homemade - it had brightness that most canned sauces do no have.  They spread the sauce evenly over the top of pizza, creating a robust punch of tomato flavor to balance out the crust and toppings.

The cheese passed the stringiness and flavor tests and was browned to tasty perfection.

The crust on the other pizza (a 14\" pie with half pepperoni and half feta cheese and roasted red peppers) was a touch undercooked.  I cannot believe how much feta they applied.  All that wet cheese probably contributed to the underdone crust.

After applying my $10 restaurant.com certificate, I ended up paying $18, not too bad costing the quality of the meal.  However, at full price, the pizzas were on the pricey side.

So down to the important question, would I return?  In a vacuum, yes I would.  However, this location faces some tough competition, near long time local stalwart Anna's Pizza and one of my personal faves, Salvatore's Tomato Pies.  To be honest, I would probably end up going to nearby Salavatore's if wanted a pizza in Sun Prairie.  However, if Falbo Bros. Pizza opened up shop in my native Waunakee, no doubt I would be a loyal customer."}
{"text":"I found the best pizza in Madison, friends. It took 8 years of Madison-dwelling but after careful consideration this is it. It doesn't get any better in this city. They boast an amazing cheese and sauce combination that other Madison pizza places cannot manage to do. ALSO the calzones are amazing. I get mine with spinach and feta."}
{"text":"The food wasn't bad.  We ordered a meatball sandwich and the heater sandwich, cheese bread and \"wings\".  The wings are frozen chicken strips with dipping sauce. The meatballs you could tell were frozen too.  The cheese was the saving grace on all the food!  The heater sandwich was loaded with cheese and hot sauce with a hint of garlic.  We had it delivered and the food was on time but as I handed the driver his tip in cash he looked at it in disgust because it was in $1s.  It was still a 20% but apparently not good enough.  The price was decent for everything except the \"wings\".  The serving size was big for everything."}
{"text":"Falbo Brothers is my go-to for my greasy pizza cravings in Madison. 

Their crust is great, thick or thin, and they are always generous with the toppings (so much so that sometimes we have to ask for moderation with the fresh garlic). 

As they are a pizza place -- stick with their pizza or their falzones. Both are good. I've ordered sides on a whim before and they taste like they were just fried from frozen. Not bad, but certainly not worth taking up room that keeps you from eating more of their delicious pizza.

Oh, and one more thing -- as a lover of Chicago-style pizza they are not my go-to. They use a relatively unseasoned chunky tomato on the top and the ratio of pizza to tomato is not one that should be used in deep dish. It winds up feeling a bit more like pizza with a bland tomato soup on top. 

However if you stick with their regular pizzas you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Their pizza is good, but I was craving a deep dish pizza. Their crust was to thin for deep dish.  It is my first time in the area. Here might be different than in CA"}
{"text":"Great pizza anytime!!!   Different crusts!!  Ask them to make a steak & fries!!! Delivery fast and hot."}
{"text":"Delivery driver was unfriendly, and they didn't give me either of my sauces that I paid for. The calzone was overpriced for the small size. Cheese bread was mediocre."}
{"text":"Pizza dough was raw.  I called the restaurant, manager gave me the 3rd degree first telling me it should be gummy.  Then telling me she would talk to the driver and baker, followed by her telling my to describe the dough and just giving me the third degree.  The dough was raw, the top, the bottom, all the way through in the entire middle 5 inches of the pizza.  It wasn't just gummy on the top layer, it was raw.  I will not be ordering from here again as the manager offered no solution, was condescending and dismissive."}
{"text":"I had been craving Chicago style pizza here in Madison for such a long time, and thanks to a flyer, I knew I would eventually order from Falbo's. Well, it wasn't the best, but it wasn't the worst. Definitely true that it's nice and greasy, I felt a little queezy afterwards. Nonetheless, not a bad price for a medium stuffed pizza with 2 toppings, it's a much better value than paying $8 for 2 slices of pizza at Ians. Plus, I had a good delivery experience, they said about 60 minutes but it was more like 35-40 mins. 

So, should you try this place? Sure. Would I order again? Maybe, but I would try their deep dish next time instead."}
{"text":"Never had a bad experience with Falbo Brothers. I've ordered a million times both on Park St and now that I am on the north side. Placed an order with a somewhat cryptic note on it. They actually called to clarify. Thanks guys! Lots of places wouldn't have done that."}
{"text":"We've ordered from here a couple of times.  The pizza isn't anything special but in an increasingly shortening supply of decent pizza makers it is passable.  However, their service is terrible even for a mediocre place.  Yesterday we made a simple order - pizza, breadsticks, 2 liter of soda.  This was before any dinner rush yesterday.   Since their website works like crap we ordered through Grubhub.  When the delivery guy showed up there was no soda.  We called and you would think someone there would be interested in customer service.  But you would be wrong.   First we were told it would be at least 35-40 minutes to get our soda.  Then when asking for a refund for the undelivered soda they argued that it would be an order credit, not a refund.  Actually had to argue with them.  Needless to say it was,our last order with this place.  Too many past issues.  If you want mediocre pizza try just about anywhere else in Madison.  This place is not worth the hassle or the cost.  Frozen pizzas are better."}
{"text":"First time I ordered a thin crust I thought this was the closest I have gotten to greasy Chicago south side pizza, that I love, in a long time. Second time I ordered a Slaughterhouse 5 with extra pizza was supposed to have extra cheese but it was barely regular cheese. The last time I ordered a thin crust pizza it was like hand tossed thick and chewy. and again not much cheese. TOO MUCH DOUGH. On the edges it was rolled over and pinched like a pie it had so much dough. Then to top it off the edges were burned. I'll try it again because this seems to be the M/O of downtown pizza. And it never seems worth it or to matter to call these pizza places to resolve the issues."}
{"text":"Occasionally awesome, usually adequate."}
{"text":"had a restaurant.com coupon to use that I bought when they opened this summer. We had a large group here for Thanksgiving eve, and pizza was everyone's vote, so we decided to try this for the first time. Hadn't really heard any good bad or other prior to order. We ordered 2 deep dish and 1 thin crust. All were awesome tasting! We had 7 people and ordered 3 large pizzas and have a full pizza left over. . . and these are 20 something kids mostly eating!   Sauce is great, crusts were awesome, toppings were plentiful too. Don't second guess, and give this place a try! You'll be glad you did. We were!"}
{"text":"One of the best pizzas I've ever had. The crust is perfect, everything is made from scratch. Very friendly staff and quick service! I waited just 15 minutes for a large pizza. I recommend the chicken bacon garlic ranch pizza. Lots of unique and fun choices too!
It's a small place, mostly made for carry-outs and individual/date-like dine-ins. But man is this a good pizza!
I would say this is the best pizza place in Sun Prairie."}
{"text":"For me delivery pizza is its own thing, and Falbo is a favorite. I have to admit up front that I will order a thin crust cheese, and when It shows up I'll throw some faux pepperoni on it and stick it under the broiler for a bit. Be that as it may, there is much to love about their pizza:
The crust it crispy and chewy and is not sweet. As someone enamored with their own pizza crust achievements at home, I love theirs. Make no mistake, this is not your pizza fired at 1000 degrees for 6 minutes using a Neapolitan dough, but it's damned good crust. 
I love their sauce. It's thick and loaded with dried oregano and basil. I assume they use canned Marzano tomatoes and cook everything down for a long time, but maybe that's fantasy. I like their sauce for what I get from the taste. And I taste good tomato and oregano and basil, and I am happy.
And if you're a freak like me who can't wait to slide 4 slices out of the box, load them up with fake pepperoni and stick them into a broiler, you'll be happy. I'm sure other delivery pizza folks will love them too."}
{"text":"I have also been eating Falbo Bros pizza since college. I considered it the best pizza in Madison then and it is still the best pizza in Madison now. Great sausage. Lots of cheese. Good sauce. Great crust. This is some of the best pizza I've ever had and I've had it well over one hundred times. Go eat this pizza now."}
{"text":"Food is decent but service is TERRIBLE!  Do not trust any of the hours on their menus or website.  Both say they are open until 1:00 am on Friday and Saturday.  It is currently just after 11:00 pm on a Saturday and they are CLOSED.  Or, at the very least, are not answering their phone.  I am pretty sure they just work when they feel like it.  Unfortunately, Glass Nickel has not yet reopened after their fire, so Itzza Pizza here I come!"}
{"text":"The pizza is amazing.  I love the deep dish stuff.  Don't ever tell me how many calories - but the stuff is amazing.

Tried their salads and those were good too.  Typically, I say that most restaurants do one thing really well - however, they do many."}
{"text":"Just had delivery. Deep dish, medium 1/2 Tre Fungo, 1/2 red sauce, sausage, hot Italian sausage, mushrooms & black olives. I have to say, that was the best damn Za we've had in ages! Stringy cheese upon delivery! That never happens. Color me impressed.
Will definitely be ordering again..."}
{"text":"My new digs are very close to my work so, on occasion, I get to have lunch with my S.U. It's also close to this pizza place and I'd noticed good traffic going in and out. Since West Coast Pizza, for the most part, sucks,  we've been looking forward to getting a pie here in this eastward looking town. We called in a large thin crust with toppings to eat there and arrived minutes before it came out of the oven. Perfect timing.

The pizza I grew to love back east had in-house tomato sauce and fresh ground cheese blends. Here, the sauce was right. The Mozzarella, Romano and Parmigiana cheese blend was nice. The crust was a bit thin for my tastes. I like the tip to hang just a little. You know, where you have to support the tip with a finger? Good though. The right level of chewy-ness.

They don't put a lot of effort into the in-store dining. Two booths, no silverware, hot peppers or cheese on the table, that's it. Serving beer would be awesome but ...Don't care. The pizza was good.

They've got a fan."}
