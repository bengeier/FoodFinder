{"text":"We got carry out for the office and really enjoyed it. I had the chicken pad Thai with hot sauce on the side with egg rolls as well. I split it with a coworker and it was enough to share between the two of us. The only issue we had was the barely gave us a tablespoon of hot sauce or sweet and sour for the egg rolls. The containers were not even half full."}
{"text":"The Crazy Noodles with tofu were exceptional!  I'll skip the tomago next time though."}
{"text":"Great addition to the Lakewood dinning scene. Had lunch with my son and the food was delicious. I had my usual first time order in a restaurant of this type, the Pad Thai and the Tom Yon soup. The Pad Thai was among the best I had ever had and my soup was more than acceptable. The service was exceptional in that it was attentive without being overbearing It is my sincere hope that this excellent dinning experience is enjoyed by many for years to come."}
{"text":"Yummy food and wonderful service! Our waitress was very sweet. I got Pad Thai with Thai iced coffee (my favorite!) and my boyfriend got Pad See You, Tom Yum soup, and mango bubble tea. We really enjoyed it. We liked the fact that it was a big restaurant, and even though we went on a Friday night, there was no wait. Next time we are Lakewood, we will return! (4.5 stars)"}
{"text":"I have been to this location before but this time I was absolutely blown away. We went there earlier for lunch and I was pleased with the pricing. The flavors are mild but delightful and I adored the Tom Kar soup- it was very flavorful and fresh. The service was prompt and very polite. They were accommodating with our gluten-free needs and double checked sauces that were typical for the appetizers we ordered and provided us with appropriate replacements. I adored the flower radish and carved turnip and I will say that their presentation is beautiful. The one improvement I could suggest would be if they could provide fresh hot mint or ginger tea. It is one of my favorite staples at a Thai restaurant, but the bagged Jasmine tea was delightful as well."}
{"text":"The best Thai food I've had in Cleveland and I have looked long and hard. Chicken pad see ew is amazing. Crab Rangoon clearly homemade - not frozen from a box. Fried rice was good - could've used a few more shrimp. Service is outstanding. Have been very responsive to and careful with my family's food allergies. We have eaten here twice a week since they opened."}
{"text":"I ate here last year and forgot about it. The service was pretty good and like the decor. The food itself was kind of mediocre however. The portions are very generous, but the food was bland and nothing really stood out about it."}
{"text":"I think since we found out about this place about a month ago we've been here 10+ times. They've only been open a couple of months and we're obsessed. I haven't been able to find a decent Thai place to replace my beloved star of siam in Chicago. This place will fix our pad Thai cravings for a long time (and their peanut sauce is amazing).   I have 2 cons that, if fixed, would make this my favorite spot in Cleveland:   the radio- they play a radio station and for a Thai place, I'd prefer some calm thai instrumentals.   Crab Rangoon -  for $5.50, I expect at least 6 pieces. This has been inconsistent, though. Sometimes 5 pieces, sometimes 6.  Finally, I have to talk about the staff. They are the most courteous, gracious people. They have an adorable teenager and 2 nice ladies at the front of the house and we also met a nice man the first time we went in. All of our experiences both eating in and ordering take out have been exceptional.   As far as favorites, I'd have to go with the chicken pad thai, the mango or taro bubble tea, Thai iced tea and the crab Rangoon (though inconsistent)."}
{"text":"The place is spotless, great service and food was delicious! I loved their pad Thai! I will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"This place is great if you want watered down versions of authentic Thai food. Don't get me wrong, I will come here again and again because the service is great! I will agree with a previous yelper's review and say that the country pad Thai was not spicy at all and maybe even a little too sweet, but I love me some sweet, so I couldn't stop eating it (sugar addict).  I took my 72 year old mom here who rarely eats any kind of ethnic food and she enjoyed the cilantro flavored wonton soup and the beautiful flower garnishes."}
{"text":"I've been working in Cleveland for well over a year now and I am always trying new places. I am a little sad I found out about this place so late. Of the things I've tried, not everything knocked it out of the park. The thom yum soup seriously lacked any substantial ingredients. It was basically flavored broth with some mushrooms thrown in. No other vegetables, and also too strong in like a ketchupy flavor. The crab ragoons had too much cream cheese and too little crab for my taste. Although, it wasn't overly fried...so I think this would be a plus for someone who enjoys that ratio of cream cheese to crab.  So why do I think this place deserves 4 stars? This small, local business serves different duck curries for about $16...that is VERY reasonable in my opinion. Many Thai places don't offer the duck option because it's more expensive to them and requires more preparation. And when they do offer it, it's easily $20+. I ordered the panag curry with duck and it was very good. The curry had great flavor and a generous amount of vegetables. I will say that I wish the duck was more moist, but that's just me being picky. It was tasty, and I would honestly order again and again. For $16, I would easily become a regular...however, I would probably venture to try other appetizers."}
{"text":"Crab rangoon was the worst I've  ever had.  Way too much gooey filling.  One was still cool in the middle.  What a shame considering their awesome spot in lakewood.  Sprite was watered down and never brought lemons we asked for.  Pad thai was subpar.   Better than thai kitchen on madison but not nearly as good as bangkok thai in mayfield heights score 40%"}
{"text":"Food was great but overpriced for dinner.  When you try this place, hit up lunch!  Same offerings much cheaper!  I got mango curry - yum!  Orange chicken and crab rangoon were also on point!"}
{"text":"I decided to try Brown Sugar Thai for the first time today and was pleasantly surprised! The simple decor, friendly service, and calming music all lent to the experience.  And of course the food.  They have a very impressive selection for a new restaurant, and I was not disappointed by the quality. Crab Rangoons were delicate and sweet, several notches above what you get from you standard Asian take out. Their bubble tea was definitely a treat in of itsself, I highly recommend the mango!  I ordered the seafood madness and the curry sauce with the dish was awesome. Can't wait to take my girlfriend here again."}
{"text":"Seriously, how can this place have 4 stars?! It's the worst Thai food I've ever had.   Meat was over cooked and tough, noodles were dry, and veggies seemed gross and limp, like they used frozen.   And $30 for 2 terrible entrees- rip off! Never again."}
{"text":"Worst Thai food in my life!! Bland! No flavor at al!! If you want authentic Thai food, stay away from this one!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Masaman curry with tofu. Carrots and onions weren't really cooked at all. Almost had a raw feel to them they were so crunchy. Sauce was bland as was the tofu. I don't think they cooked the sauce with the veggies at all.   For $13 I expect my curry dish to have flavor  and taste like the chef gave a damn. Waste of a meal and money so I don't think I will bother giving it a second chance. Far to many better places that cost much less such as Thai Kitchen on Madison.   Interior looked nice and the staff was friendly that's why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1."}
{"text":"We tried takeout from Brown Sugar Thai last weekend. Like other posters, I was excited for a new Asian option in Lakewood, especially in that spot where other restaurants have come and gone.  We ordered Beef Satay, Pork in Garlic Sauce, and Country Style Pad Thai with shrimp. The beef satay was very overcooked and tough. The pork dish was decent but bland, and the pad thai was not very flavorful and the shrimp was overcooked. There were no chopped peanuts or cilantro on the pad thai, which was disappointing.  I also thought the prices were pretty steep, especially since the food was subpar. I've had much better food at other Thai restaurants like Map of Thailand, Lemon Grass and Banana Blossom.   I'll give it another shot since it's close to home, and I'm hopeful Brown Sugar Thai can pull it together!"}
{"text":"Wow! We went here for the first time last night, and we can't wait to go back.  The chicken satay was succulent and grilled perfectly.  We had a basil and chicken dish and a masaman curry (with sweet potatoes and pineapple) with tofu.  Incredible! The service was great."}
{"text":"The Country Style Pad Thai here is SO good. Lots of food for the price- I always have one or two servings of leftovers. Have always done carry out, but restaurant looks clean and inviting. Workers are very friendly."}
{"text":"We have been here twice this week and both times were delicious. The service is friendly and polite. We will be back the next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Fantastic. Great service, food was amazing, get the rainbow sushi - Sooooo good!  Highly recommend as the portions were big and delicious."}
{"text":"The food was good, but the waitress was the rude and in the middle of taking our order she walked away to greet people who just walked in the door. They could have waited another minute or two until she was done taking our order to seat them. Honestly, she looked overwhelmed in the tiny dining area. But another girl came from the back to refill our waters and was very quite and sweet. Didn't like the waitress, but the food was pretty good. Maybe I'd get takeout next time."}
{"text":"Friendly, professional staff.  The food was good and came out in a timely manner. The dining room and bathrooms were clean and pleasant."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Thai cuisine and was delighted with my first excursion to Brown Sugar Thai. Split the beef salad with the rest of my party...the beef was tender and the dressing was delicious. It would be a great light dinner or a perfect lunch. The Tom-Yum noodle soup was outstanding-plenty of seafood and a flavorful broth. Our server was completely adorable and very accommodating. A great addition to the Rocky River dining scene."}
{"text":"Every time I've ordered here the food had exquisite flavor. The hosts are extremely gracious for our support of this establishment. Vegan and gluten free options are available!!"}
{"text":"Visited again for Saturday lunch today.  This time I dined in for the first time.  I was very sad to see the restaurant empty at Noon on a Saturday.  Nevertheless, I had an outstanding experience.  I ordered the Red Thai Curry with vegetables at spice level 4.  (Brown Sugar bases their spice on a 1-5 level).  The dish was extremely tasty and perfectly spiced - hot enough to make me eat slow and make my nose run, but not too hot!  Water was served in small elegant water glasses and my servers were exceptionally attentive, refilling my glass eight times.  I probably should have just had them leave the water pitcher at my table...  The Red Thai Curry was exceptional and I can't wait to return next week!  -----------------------  My first visit to Brown Sugar.  Parked in the nearby free parking.  Clean and attractive restaurant interior.  Ordered the Red Thai Curry with Tofu as carry out for lunch today.  Order was ready to go in about 5 minutes.  I arrived home to find the appetizing meal nicely packaged in a plastic tray.  Curry was great, portions were just right and I had a great lunch.  Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I really wanted this place to be good Bc I love Thai food! The popular Thai restaurants I've eaten at before were always light, healthy and delicious. But this is the UNHEALTHY and extremely greasy form of it. Taste more like American Chinese food. And the peanut sauce with the summer rolls is WAYYY too sweet. I mean it's suppose to be sweet but this peanut sauce, I had to spit out Bc it was like they dumped a pound of sugar or HFCS into one little container of sauce. And they use so much oil! now I FEEL SICK. Horrible experience"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with the Pad See Me with chicken. Steamed dumplings are great too. If you like really hot food, get the curry!"}
{"text":"When I go to a Thai restaurant, I don't go out of the box... at all- as a vegetarian, tofu Pad Thai is about all I order. As far as Brown Sugar, I would say this is a pretty generic Pad Thai. The flavor is sort of sweet, but there is nothing special about this Pad Thai. The color is also off, my Pad Thai was completely white in color, which I've never seen before from a restaurant. The Pad Thai also didn't have any steamed vegetables, every noodle dish needs a little something extra, which this sourly lacked. On the plus side, the portion sizes were quite large and the price was right for the meal."}
{"text":"Good, basic Asian food. Heavy on the oil, but they will use less if they ask them to. Curries and pad Thai are nice. The folks who work the counter for carry out are very kind."}
{"text":"My friend Janeen and I tried this restaurant out yesterday.  We started out with crab  rangoon (delicious!).  Then I had the salmon and avocado roll, tuna and avocado roll, and shrimp tempura roll.  Everything was fabulous.  Janeen had Pad Thai with shrimp.  Delicious as well.  The restaurant is so nice and the service is exceptional."}
{"text":"Over cooked meat in every dish, including rubbery beef in the green curry, burned crispy duck, dried out chicken in the Pad Thai, and chewy orange chicken. Spicy dishes were not spicy, and all dishes were bland. Even the fried pot stickers were chewy and tasteless.  And the Siam rolls were not crisp.  The first and last time we will order food at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Ordered mango fried rice.  Had a LOT of rice, not so much mango, maybe 3 pieces, or other veggies. It was a \"Meh\" for sure.  Well...at least I tried a new place. Next!"}
{"text":"Have had this a few times for take out. Food was always great and you can tell it is fresh quality product.  The price is higher than normal for Thai but hopefully that won't run everyone off. The place is always empty but they seem to do a good amount of togo orders so hope that will suffice.  Crispy pad Thai is delicious. Sushi was good as well."}
{"text":"As a disclaimer I don't eat a lot of Thai food, so I am not qualified to say what is authentic.  But I did find the beef skewers to be almost inedible and the chicken pad Thai to be rather bland.  The servers were great, and the atmosphere was pleasant but not noteworthy."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service! I would definitely come back here. Everything was so delicious and we received soup on house! Definitely give this place a try! Big big thumbs up!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm extremely pleased with the food at this restaurant. My family has been twice. We've thoroughly enjoyed all dishes including their Sushi. Lots of flavor and the ingredients are fresh. I highly recommend giving this place a try. Fabulous quality"}
{"text":"Very good entrees, curry and basil fried rice, however the summer rolls were a bit rubbery... I'm not sure how fresh they were based on how quickly they came out after ordering.  The service was very good though along with the presentation of the dishes.  Besides the entrees tasting great, the portions were generous as well so overall a good experience despite the lackluster start."}
{"text":"Amazing food!!!!!!!!!! I love this place. Theyre so fast but the quality is top notch. Nice staff and menu selection. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Sushi is excellent but like others have said, other dishes are hit or miss. Orange chicken isn't fried instead the breading is mush. The fried rice was extra and it tastes like raw egg and smells like a hamster ball."}
{"text":"Unfortunately the best way to describe the food here was bland.   Was in town in June and stopped in based on the positive reviews. Unfortunately they did not live up to the actual food.   The wonton noodle soup was bland, the broth was most likely water, and had a couple of noodles and a piece of cabbage. I had higher hopes for the Pad Thai and was met with equal disappointment. The best part about Thai cuisine is the flavor and heat that goes along with it, the Pad Thai missed on both. The chicken was so over cooked it was rubbery and there was no flavor to be had there."}
{"text":"I got Tom Yum Noodle Soup, my husband got drunken noodle. Also Tekka maki, Unagi, Ebi, and Saba sushi. Server was nice, food was good (sushi rice was too big tho...) , I will come back!"}
{"text":"Great to have more options in River. Friendly and courteous service. As stated before, wide variety of dishes to choose from. Everything fresh with excellent presentation. I will be back. Only 4 stars because 5 stars are rare anywhere. Tell them how spicy you want it, they are very willing to adjust to your palate. Give it a try. You will be pleased, and you'll come back.  Bon apetite"}
{"text":"Low and Behold another in place in Lakewood now has sushi! I did not try it in my last visit but I'm excited I can order it for lunch.  This place is always consistent with their food. It's fast and it's delicious. I have only ever been to the Lakewood location and this location is always clean and the people working are very friendly. I love having a Thai place so close to where I live,"}
{"text":"I had the chicken pad Thai worst thing I have ever try. The smell suffocate me. Taste sooo oily."}
{"text":"Amazing meal. The Basil Fried Rice was worth the trip! The staff was attentive and flexible with my friend's requests. All good!"}
{"text":"One of the best Asian restaurants on the west side. Reasonable prices, really excellent food, including sushi, and never busy. Very overlooked compared to some of the other popular spots in the center of Lakewood."}
{"text":"What a sugar-sweet destination for delicious Thai food!   In a neighborhood quite saturated with Thai restaurants, Brown Sugar Thai Cuisine stands out as a name of its own with an authentic flavor, fresh ingredients, and a spicy kick worthy of praise. In addition, they have simply scrumptious noodles at a high-value price. My to-go boxes of country-style Pad Thai are consistently filled to the brim and packed with that yummy tamarind/peanut flavor. You can easily ration this into 3-4 meals (or scarf it down in 1 meal...hey, I don't judge).  A special shoutout to the vegetable dishes of  BSTC! Mothers all around the globe would be beaming with approval if they saw these large-cut perfectly-cooked well-seasoned vegetables. Try any tofu & vegetable dish and you'll surely be fighting over that last broccoli. Even better, your kid may battle you for that last broccoli!  There is large representation from all the major food groups and popular Thai dishes. Taste diversity is certainly not an issue at BSTC. Sweet or savory, they have you covered. Looking forward to returning to this lovely restaurant for more Thai food!"}
{"text":"Appetizers were great. We ordered Siam roll and fried pot stickers which were delicious. Everything was good up until we ordered our meals. I got the chicken teriyaki and my husband ordered the pad Thai with chicken and shrimp. Mine was good but the meat on the pad Thai was not cooked at all. He threw it up! They served us raw chicken on the noodles"}
{"text":"Always excellent service. My food is always great. Pad Thai is my favorite country style with chicken. I love the coconut soup. We frequent brown sugar a lot, it's the best Thai/ Asian food or found in the area!"}
{"text":"OK, so this place was OK. I don't really know much about Thai food and i usually get the same thing everywhere I go. That said, I had the Country Style Pad Thai which was good, but sweet. I'm used to have Pad Thai that isn't so sweet and I'm not so sure I like the sweetness. It was also labeled as mildly spicy but I didn't find it the least bit spicy. I also had some hot and sour soup w/ chicken. It was ok - not great. and Danielle and i shared Shrimps in Blankets which were incredibly hot but probably my favorite things we had."}
{"text":"Great place, people and food! I have to commend them on putting up with my very \"customized\" requests.  Ex: I always ask which veggies come on a dish and have them put more or sub out the ones that aren't my fave for the good ones ;) They are ALWAYS accommodating:)  The staff is so polite and kind and the food very tasty. Portions are very generous and pricing very reasonable. I am happy to have this good option for Thai food in my neighborhood! In general I would say Cleveland is blessed with the very good option for a Thai food ( I am so thankful!)   Another exciting point- they offer sushi!!! So I have only tried the avocado/ cucumber - but yumm-it was good."}
{"text":"Amazing Thai! Ordered takeout on a Monday night, and it was ready in 10 minutes. My boyfriend and I had the summer rolls, crab Rangoon (awesome!!!), crazy noodles and pad Thai. Will defiantly be going back soon."}
{"text":"Had the crab Rangoon, was well cooked with lots of filling but a little sweet. Pad Thai was dry and also was a bit too sweet. Chicken satay was good. Very tender and juicy. Thai iced tea was great. Probably won't come here again as there are other Thai places I like better. But it wasn't terrible."}
{"text":"Such a cute little place, the presentations are neat and beautiful. I had the veggie curry and it was delicious. The Thai tea is legit and they do a good job with all the sauce they make. Service is great as well. 5 star!"}
{"text":"Nice Thai restaurant in the neighborhood. Food was just as I expected. Very well prepared with the right amount of spice. Staff was very friendly and made the visit pleasant."}
{"text":"Visited here for lunch last week. I opted for sushi. I found it odd they did not offer any sushi lunch combos, but I proceeded to order a negihama and tuna-avo maki. It was not good. The rolls were on the smallish side (esp. for $5.50 each) and not tightly rolled. The yellowtail was obviously old. It had a slight fishy smell and taste. The avocado on the other roll was a bit under ripe. Paid $13 including tip for low end grocery store quality sushi. Also, I have had Thai food at the Rocky River location in the past and it was very bland and overpriced. Would not go back to either location."}
{"text":"Soup had fresh veggies and was hot. Service was prompt and friendly. Options are many and common for Thai cuisine. I found their Pad Thai too sweet for my taste, but that didn't keep me from eating most of it. My son had the Broken/Crazy noodles with shrimp and enjoyed it; fresh veggies in that dish looked good. Love the carrot roses on the fresh orange like a blessing/offering on each plate."}
{"text":"This place is actually quite good! They have two locations in river and in Lakewood but visit the Lakewood one more often. I really love the chicken pad thai!"}
{"text":"Good thai food and super nice staff. I always order out for no particular reason. They seem to remember me and my order and even remember to make my order correctly when I forget to specify.  Great thai fried rice. Very tasty thai sweet and sour chicken. Not heavy like a lot of Chinese verso nam good cuts of meat, not grizzled or fat. Fresh veggies in the dish as well. Had a few apps and goos. Haven't explored much of the rest of the menu as I am completely happy getting the same dishes each time. Def a good place to have in river."}
{"text":"Thai restaurant names provide an eternal source of loving humor for me; they are almost always expressed through the formula \"Thai __X__\" or \"__X__ Thai,\" with X = a random kitchen ingredient or cultural symbol.  Brown Sugar Thai might crack my top 10 list, joining the elite company of classics such as Thai Rice, Thai Basil, Jasmine Thai, Thai Elephant and Thai Noodle.  Name aside, I left very impressed with easy-to-overlook, nondescript Brown Sugar Thai.  Very fresh and nuanced preparations: summer rolls tightly wrapped with mint and basil (fresh, even in the dead of winter), tangy larb salad that spills over crisp greens, and scrumptious, chewy homemade-looking pad see ew noodles accented perfectly with sweet soy, egg, and melt-in-your-mouth soft tofu.    Each dish is garnished with an intricately-peeled carrot or radish  in the shape of a flower.  This is the little kind of touch that confirms what the food quality already suggests: that there is someone back there in the kitchen with a patient, skilled hand who understands the importance of details and appreciates the convergence between food and art."}
{"text":"Portion size: 5 stars, as I got two meals out of it.   Taste in comparison to other Thai places: 2 stars, as my yellow curry vegetables sat in a watered down, tasteless soup.   My boyfriend really enjoys the place, and the pad thai is pretty good, thus allowing for a balanced 3 star review.   This place would be much better if the portions were a little bit smaller, as well as a price reduction. $12 for chicken and vegetables with rice is too much for mediocre thai takeout."}
{"text":"I've only ever had the Pad Thai, but it's good enough that I don't see a need to order anything else.  Really friendly staff, and a clean shop.  They have a really small patio area to eat outside, too!"}
{"text":"Pros: lots of vegetarian options. Nice staff who are willing to answer questions and be accommodating of special diets. The vegetable fried rice was nicely flavored.   Cons: bland food. Maybe My request for mildly spicy was taken to an extreme."}
{"text":"Food is good. Service is friendly but the kitchen takes FOREVER. Do NOT recommend for anything beyond a 3 hour meal. No such thing as a quick lunch."}
{"text":"We have ordered numerous times from the one in Lakewood! The sushi is actually better than some sushi places in the area, and they will really up that spice level when requested!  Highly recommend: Tom yum soup with chicken, green curry with chicken spicy with avocado"}
{"text":"I came in for my first time yesterday for lunch! I did take out and just walking in how friendly and wonderful the employees were I could tell I made a good choice! The crab Rangoon was delicious. I came in again today for dinner, did take out again did and I just love this place!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff! Good food, and hot and cold bubble tea options. This place is definitely a favorite of mine for Thai food. I got the vegetable crispy pad Thai this time around and the haystack, thin noodles were just right to not be fried hard."}
{"text":"StentNow my favorite Thai restaurant. The service is excellent and the food is consistantly excellent. Love the coconut soup, country pad Thai, sushi and drunken noodle were so yummy. Sticky rice and mango for dessert! This beats Cravings now!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I decided to visit Brown Sugar for the first time on a Friday night at 8:30. The place was empty except for one other couple and we were seated immediately by the waitress.  We ordered spring rolls as an appetizer and they are as good as any we've had before. Dinner was quickly served- Pad Thai for me, pineapple droid rice for the misses. Both dishes were well seasoned, but the fruit rind carved into a lotus flower was a bit weird. Overall, the food was better than we expected, service was good and the price is on average for any Thai we've experienced. This place should be busier than it is- hopefully this helps!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this restaurant for years and it never gets old! Very clean interior and such welcoming servers. I always enjoy my experiences here"}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time since it opened last night for take out and I'm still contemplating how I feel about it.   I ordered the Country Style Pad Thai, and an order of Crab Rangoon.  I really like hot food so I asked for my Pad Thai at an 8.  Yes, bold for it being my first time there, but it wasn't that hot at all.  I enjoyed it definitely, but if you like it hot I would suggest asking for the 10.  Also my portion was HUGE.  It filled the small black container you can see in the photos to the brim.  I ate it for dinner, lunch today, and still have enough for another meal!  While the pad thai was good, the crab rangoon was horrendous! They give you 5 in an order which is nice, but I barely ate two of them they were that bad.  Whatever they use as the filling is WAYY too much, and not tastey.  I wish I could be more descriptive of what it was but all I can say is do not order it.  The dough is in thin and it wasn't very crispy and the filling was overwhelming.    I picked up a menu on the way out and there are definitely other meals I would like to try so I will be back, but I have definitely had better thai but I've also had worse.  As far as the simplicity of quick ordering and still hot when I got back home it was good."}
{"text":"Only ever had takeout from here. LOVE their soups. The Tom-Yum and Tom- Khar are phenomenal (I like mixing the two). The summer rolls are always delicious. I usually get their Mango Curry, very sweet. Not spicy at all, but you can adjust the heat.Tried their chicken Pad Thai and found it disappointing. Huge portion but lackluster flavour."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout and was eating my green curry dish when I ended up with a long black hair in my mouth after taking a couple of bites. That was very disappointing. I don't have black hair!"}
{"text":"I threw out the cashew chicken because it was that bad. I was very disappointed in this place. Will stick to Thai elephant at kamms"}
{"text":"Went there last night with a friend to celebrate a birthday.  Service was outstanding. Ordered Mexican Maki suchi, Crab Rangoon appetizer,  Crispy Pad Thai with shrimp, and Tamarind duck. Each was excellent and presentation was superb. It's rare when I find everything about a restaurant enjoyable and inviting. I will be back."}
{"text":"I love Brown Sugar Thai! I have been here several times and never had a bad experience. I am always greeted upon arrival, seated promptly, and food comes out fast!! Not to mention that there is always great food presentation. From the carefully crafted straw flowers to the oranges made out of flowers. The food always looks great and tastes even better!!! There Thai yellow curry chicken is to die for and their Thai Iced Tea is delish!"}
{"text":"I grabbed a carry out from here on a cold winter night. The service was quick. The employees were friendly. And I got a ton of good food for the price!"}
{"text":"We get takeout from here and the Lakewood location quite frequently.  This place is tasty and the people who work here are incredibly friendly and kind.  They always greet you with a warm smile.  The country-style pad thai and pad see-ew have been consistently good.  The orange chicken is very sweet-- I like this but others who prefer more savory may not care for it.  The sushi offerings are limited but hit the spot for quick takeout.  Presentation is also nice if you decide to eat in."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant!!! Both the food and service are exceptional. Get the Tom Yum pho! Most delicious pho I've ever had. The sushi is also very fresh. A gem in this city."}
{"text":"Eaten there a dozen times. Servers are always friendly. Food always fresh and interesting. The \"lunch box\" is a full meal. We have tried just about everything. Chicken Basil is my current favorite along with the String Beans and Tofu. Try the shumai appetizer. Place is clean, bright and cheerful. Parking is basically free if you are there less than an hour. Walk there or enter the parking lot off Warren."}
{"text":"Dined here for the second time over the weekend. My 1st time visiting the restaurant was a really good experience, this time however- not so much. I ordered the mango curry specialty dish, asked it they could tone down the spiciness to a one level, the server said yes no problem. When the dish came out it looked very good, but as soon as I took my 1st bite I knew they didn't adjust the spice in the dish. I told the server that it was too spicy for me and she said they would re-make the dish for me. She promptly took it away and said it would be about 10 mins. No sooner than she took the dish away she was bringing it back...okay red flag, they did not remake this dish. Yep, at 1st glance the bowl looked like soup and there it was, my rice was swimming in the dish. That would be my rice that I added to the dish when I took my 1st bite. When I questioned if they remade the dish or just added more liquid the server sheepishly said they added more coconut milk, oh did you want the whole thing made again??? At this point I was just hugely disappointed, I said that's fine I'll keep the dish but I'm not happy. Its not worth sending it back again to possibly get food poisoning because I pissed the chef off in the back. So. I ate a little bit of my still too spicy dish and left. Now, the 1st time I dined here I got the massaman curry lightly spiced and it was wonderful, so I know they can adjust the spice accordingly. Perhaps it was an off night, ill try it again for a 3rd time but will stay away from the 1 and 2 chili pepper dishes....i guess that means the Pad Thai is what I'm stuck with. :-("}
{"text":"Great food and service. The staff was very attentive and the food was delicious. The portions were bigger than I expected, which is not a bad thing. I would highly recommend the tofu string bean curry, it's delicious. It's listed on the menu as spicy, but it can use a little more heat in my opinion. I always add pineapple to this dish. It's fantastic."}
{"text":"First time here as a Yelper, and the first time ever for Thai, for  the wife. I had gotten the Crispy  Pad Thai Vegetables, the octopus two piece sushi, mmm good all of it was very tasty and worth the . The wife had the Pad Thai Vegetables for her first experience and she raved. We had also gotten summer rolls, very good as well. To drink I had Mango Smoothie and she had one of the bubble teas, I think it was the Chai. I can say we will be back for some more goodness. As for the price it's a high end Thai restaurant but with healthy options. Looking to eat good and healthy this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Love to do takeouts from Brown Sugar for Thai food, order ready very quick.  Just hope that they have more choices on their menu"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. I ordered crazy drunken noodle dish extra spicy 8/10. Little to no veggies except some pea pods, the spice level was a flat out 0. I think they forgot it. The worst thing was the over cooked soggy noodles. Totally not worth the $10 I paid for it. I would not buy this dish again or recommend it."}
{"text":"Very good food. Highly recommend the box lunches. Great service.  Easy parking . Good curry!"}
{"text":"Small Thai place in Lakewood, Ohio off Detroit....Ordered the Chicken Satay for the table...The Satay was extremely tasty but for almost 7 dollars was a very small portion....It was served in 4 pieces on the 4 different skewers.....The pieces were only about 2.5 inches long per skewer....super thin..For this reason I was somewhat disappointed...I have ordered Chicken Satay in many different places and this was by far the smallest portion I have ever received for the table. I also ordered the Hot & Sour soup by the cup...It was tasty but not as spicy as hot and sour soup usually is...It had more of a sweet taste than a spicy hot taste.....For my main entree I ordered the Orange Chicken and this was served just right! The orange sauce was not overbearing and the consistency was not overly thick. It was a very tasty and hearty portion. I would definitely give them another change. The restaurant was clean, the staff and wait service was friendly and prompt and for the most part the portion matched the price except for the chicken satay."}
{"text":"Absolutely phenomenal Thai food with very reasonable prices. We have been twice and are going to make it a staple in our usual spots. The service is also excellent with attentive wait staff and speedy ticket times. Watch out for the heat! A 1-2 is bearable for most people, 3+ will kick a bit! Recommended to friends and family."}
{"text":"The curry here is good. Much to our surprise, other things are not. We paid a lot for Uber eats delivery. The chicken with pine nuts' sauce may as well have been water with absolutely no spice or seasoning. The pad Thai was simply okay but, again, no real flavor. Had we been at the restaurant, we would have sent it back to the kitchen. Stick to the curry and you should be fine."}
{"text":"I came for lunch and had the Seafood Country Style Pad Thai off the lunch menu. It was the spicy offering.  It has a slow burn rather than setting your mouth on fire. This dish was delicious. The seafood and noodles were cooked perfectly. It was sweet and spicy.   Beware the \"jasmine\" rice is plain steamed white rice.  They also gave us a soup as an appetizer that was good too.   Overall a good value. I came with a group of 9 and our food was timely and our soft drinks and water kept flowing. The service is top notch. I can't wait to come again."}
{"text":"Excellent place! I went here for lunch with my friend and he highly recommended it. With that being said, I got the seafood with the pad Thai and it was delicious! The service was great and they were very tentative to us. And as odd as it sounds, get the strawberry smoothie because it is an explosion of deliciousness all up in your mouth. Go there."}
{"text":"Tom yum shrimp very nice. The crab rangoon was very lite and tasty. Pad thai was worth getting again. Mango rolls were just ok. Dumplings (pot stickers) were good. Worth going back."}
{"text":"Love this place. Was recommended by a friend who used to live in the area.  Great food both dine in and carry out.  And when you dine in they make little flowers out of radishes and zucchini.  My parents request to go here whenever they are in town. Pad Thai country style is my go to."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I have to lower my rating for Brown Sugar. In the past I thought the food was pretty tasty, but a recent order from there was a bit lackluster and definitely did not have the Thai flavors I was expecting. I did go to Thailand this year so maybe it's not fair to compare, but other restaurants like Thai Thai in Lakewood hold up to authentic cuisine so I don't know...  The Pad Thai was bland in looks and taste. It was missing that lime and slightly sweet flavor from the sugar. It also seemed more like the noodles were tossed in just some light oil. The Massaman Curry, while it had some light heat, was missing that cinnamon spice flavor and slightly sweet taste even though it had chunks of pineapple in it. Definitely not a rich sauce.   Also the friendly lady who worked the front is no longer there it seems.   Meh. Food wasn't bad, but I have definitely had better and will probably go elsewhere for my Thai cravings in the future. Sorry Brown Sugar :("}
{"text":"First time here.  Ordered take out. Pot stickers were good but the Chicken Pad Thai was super sweet with not a hint of any Thai spices. There was only about 6 thin, small slices of chicken with no flavor.  Requested fried rice but was given noodles.  $16!  Won't go back."}
{"text":"Really good. My son and I stopped in during a \"Dad's night\" dinner. It was delicious. I'm actually disappointed that he hasn't suggested that we go back yet, but I'm sure that he will soon. We both enjoyed it very much. Very good Thai."}
{"text":"When we first went in, it was fine. The place was clean and looked nice. The menu had enough on it. Unfortunately, I won't be calling this my favorite place. The food was a bit pricey for the type of food and the amount you get. As mentioned before, the summer rolls are the same price as other places, if not more $5.50 for less than other places would offer. There were six pieces, which looks like the equivalent of two rolls, but the rolls were a sparse and a little stiff. There was only just enough hoisin sauce to put a decent amount, but not enough if you love hoisin on your rolls. I got the pad see yoo, which tasted fine. I got it with tofu, but unfortunately the tofu was a bit bland, which may just be my expectations.  The Thai tea was too sweet for my taste. Either there was too much condensed milk or the tea wasn't strong enough.  Overall, decent place, but not my top preference."}
{"text":"I loved this place! My husband and I are still new to the area, so we're always trying to find the \"best\" this and that. I was in the mood for sushi last night and Brown Sugar was great! I ordered 2 spicy tuna rolls, Crab Rangoon and my husband had their spicy Pad Thai. Everything was delicious and the Pad Thai portion was big enough for two meals! This will be our go-to when we're craving some Asian cuisine!"}
{"text":"The food was decent. If I was to rate the food alone, I'd still give it two stars.   I met up here with some friends. The restaurant was pretty empty, only a couple people trickled in, but even then they seemed to be trying to rush us out.   Afterwards, I ordered food to go - Pad Thai with seafood. It was a pretty large portioned tray of food: a ton of noodles, 3 shrimp and a scallop that was sliced into 4 smaller pieces. It probably sounds like I'm being petty, but for the amount of noodles that was in there, and it seemed like a really small \"seafood\" to noodle ratio. I feel like I paid $16 for mediocre noodles :/"}
{"text":"Exceptional service, amazing food. Whether it's picked up or eating in restaurant its always piping hot and ready to enjoy. Can't say enough good things about this place. The teriyaki chicken and pot stickers are my favs. The portions are hefty so be prepared for left overs!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to see a Thai place in Lakewood and I finally talked my son into trying it out last night. The place was comfortable and clean. The staff was very nice and very attentive. We ordered the Pot Stickers as an appetizer - yum. My son ordered Orange Chicken and I ordered the Country Pad Thai. We both enjoyed our meals, left full and satisfied. We will be returning, as there are so many dishes I wanted to try! The price is fair and is comparable to other \"good\" asian restaurants (e.g. King Wah) This is a \"sit down\" restaurant, don't expect generic menus with generic prices."}
{"text":"Way below average.  Scallop eggplant dish was edible, but pad thai was too lemony, pad see ew's beef was way over cooked.  My kids who usually gobble that stuff up wouldn't touch it.  Plus, the menu has so many things misspelled!  Don't they care enough to proofread??  Much better options elsewhere - we wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"This was my first time here, and was I ever impressed! The shumai was superb, and the drunken noodle? Ever so delicious! I can't wait to return!!"}
{"text":"Unbelievably rude staff. Flies fell into our bubble tea. But the food was ok. Wouldn't go back, not because of the flies but because of the staff!"}
{"text":"Summer rolls were perfect! Ready in 15 minutes for pick up. I will be ordering again!"}
{"text":"I got takeout, crazy (drunken) noodle with chicken. Super fast (ready in under 15 min) and staff was very pleasant. I will definitely order from here again and try more dishes on the menu. I do, however, agree that the menu is overpriced for the amount of food you get. I paid over 10 dollars for a container of food that left me a little hungry afterwards. If they adjusted the prices or gave more for the price, I would be a regular for sure."}
{"text":"Mango curry was DE-lish! Shrimp pad Thai, also a winner! This was our first time so I'm only giving it 4 stars, but as my new favorite I plan to be back for more yummy Thai. I'll likely bump it to 5 stars then. Service was super fast and friendly. Very clean."}
{"text":"For NE Ohio, this place is pretty great. I'm originally from the West Coast (PDX/LA) so my Asian food standards are pretty darn high, but I crossed my chop stix and went for it with my mother recently. Order was FAST. Called around dinner time and it was ready in 15 minutes. The peanut sauce was thinner than I like but the chicken was juicy and noodles were done well (not well-done like a steak but you know). I recommend it, especially if you don't want to go Downtown. Ambiance inside was average and casual - so don't expect to propose here, but then again, they don't advertise to be fancy.   Bottom line: owned local by a mom and pop who I see walk home every night when they close shop. Support and buy local and go here!"}
{"text":"I don't know why I keep trying to give them a try. The Pad Thai is soggy. The Thom Ka is too sweet. Is it supposed to be sweet? And the panang is so watery. To add to it the cashier was so rude when placing the order like I was inconveniencing her to place an order. I'm done with this place."}
{"text":"I'd really give this place a star and 1/2 but since there are so many 4 and 5 stars here I'll go with the one star.  This rating is directly based on the food and not the service.  We had the Siam rolls and it's basically 5 mini egg rolls that are very bland and you could get from any Asian grocery store and you could get a pack of 20 and it would be cheaper then  $5.50.(what they charge)  As with many reviewers have stated they are very skimpy with the shrimpy.  We both ordered entree's and got combination seafood which is a few cents more but only got two or three pieces of shrimp.  This is inexcusable for $10 each entree I'd expect more.    The pad thai had to much seasoning and the seafood delight with rice was very bland and had no taste at all.  The Bubble tea was pretty bad and I guess they don't do iced bubble tea and only do smoothie bubble tea.  Not only does it not come in the glasses that are pictured in the menu(one's on the menu were much bigger) it came with a skinny glass but tasted terrible anyways.  The place was empty for lunch and now we know why.  Never going back again.  Much better places around, Even Thai Spice is better and I give that place 2 or 3 stars."}
{"text":"i heart thai food. like, i could eat it 4 or 5 nights a week. brown sugar has a huge menu with lots of choices.  we had lunch here and literally were the only customers. very quiet.  however, the food was super yummy.  our table of four shared a bunch of different things and none of us were disappointed. looking for a variety? check BS out. there are not enough good thai restaurants around, so will definitely be stopping in again!"}
{"text":"Was very excited to see this place open. The last restaurant in this space was a disaster (see Something's Smokin' Cafe).  Decided to order takeout so I stopped in on the way home from work. Nice ambiance inside in both decor and music. The staff was friendly but a little awkward. The host at the counter had just started the day before and didn't speak much English.   What we ordered. Steamed Potstickers (4) Teriyaki Beef and Shrimp Himaparn. The food was prepared in a timely fashion and the host offered me water while I waited for my order to be ready.   The potstickers were standard but you only get four. Most places offer six to eight for the same price. They were very conservative with the ginger soy dipping sauce. Almost wasn't enough even for just the four.  The portions on the Beef and the Shrimp dishes were pretty small and I have to say I was still hungry after finishing. The flavors were good but not amazing. The biggest drawback was the PRICE. $34.00 for a takeout meal that leaves you still hungry afterwards is way too much. Not sure if I will repeat.. Might try a few other dishes but at that price and portion size, I don't see me becoming a regular.  I wish them well though."}
{"text":"Food on 4/11/17 made us extremely sick. Not only us adults but sadly my 2 year old also got sick from the pad Thai. Not sure if it was the chicken or noodles but we were so sick from the food. There was also no flavor. It tasted like rice noodles and lemon. No seasons seemed to be used at all. Bummed because I love Thai food and would have been a regular customer."}
{"text":"I moved here from LA, so I've been looking for a good Thai restaurant. The Country Style Pad Thai is the best pad Thai I've had in Ohio. It's spicy and sweet- like I think a pad Thai should be. So good!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. I love the amount of food you get for what you pay. It also tastes excellent. They have a large menu that doesn't only include thai food. There is sushi and other stir fry type of entrees. I recommend the mango curry. Also the service is excellent. We always were waited on when we needed to be and they ensured we had a good dining experience."}
{"text":"Wow! 5 stars was a big decision but the place is very good! Never crazy crowded so the service is great. The food is very obviously homemade not frozen. The crab Rangoon are some of the best I've had (I've had a lot). They're light and crispy with lots of filling. The sweet chili/sweet and sour sauce is NOT the neon red stuff you get from takeout joints. It's clear/orange and thick - made with honey im sure. Very good and flavorful. The Siam rolls are delicious and fresh as well, sauce also great. The pad Thai was very good and huge portion! I took it home and gladly ate it for lunch the next day. I am weird about leftovers so that's great!   I will be back and might have to order two orders of crab Rangoon bc I don't want to share them!"}
{"text":"The Thai Beef Salad - Was Soooooo Bland  No Flavor - No Kick - No Spice - No Thai Beef was horrible quality, a definite disappointment 0-Stars Mango Fried Rice w/Shrimp - 2 of the 6 Shrimp were NOT cleaned! Carrots were not cooked, but the flavor of the rice - 2 Stars Chicken Pot Stickers - Was what I was forced to eat, b/c the salad was not edible. 1-Star"}
{"text":"Really good! Got the Fisherman delight...love the spicy brown sauce.  Almost like a fisherman Louisiana gumbo....very very good!"}
{"text":"Really artful food. The food was very fresh and original.  We had mango rolls, veggie tempura, pad Thai and sushi.   Outstanding service.  Pretty atmosphere, though they could lose some of the silk flowers. We will be telling our friends and coming back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner on a Sunday night and was quite impressed.  The atmosphere is nice and the service was great!  The husband started with a spicy tuna roll which he said was quite good and had a nice sesame flavor.  I started with the fresh mango rolls.  They were tasty but I didn't care for the texture of the mango.  The mango was too crunchy.  For dinner I ordered the prik pow fried rice with tofu and the husband got a chicken dish.  We both loved our food.  Mine was delicious.  I ordered it extra spicy and it did not come out very spicy, however they have an excellent hot sauce on the table that had a decent heat to it, which did the trick. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've been here 4 times now and have ordered the same thing every time; drunken noodles. I just can't seem to get myself to order anything else because they are SO GOOD. There are lots of different flavors in each bite and everything balances out deliciously. And the texture of the noodles themselves is perfect. The service is also terrific. Every time I've gone in the staff was super friendly. No complaints whatsoever! I hope this place sticks around!"}
{"text":"Ordered Pineapple Fried Rice with Pork, to go, even container says Pork. Also ordered it 4/5 spicy. No question it is chicken, bland, dry chicken. Drove 20 mins for this Saturday night take out and while my summer roll was tasty, dipping sauce is the best ever, my main meal was so disappointing."}
{"text":"Words can't describe how tasty this place is. I got the Pad Thai Country Style. It was perfectly cooked and had just enough peanut to add a little crunch to the noodles and chicken. I also got a strawberry smoothie, and it was honestly the best smoothie I've ever tasted. I wasn't expecting that! My brother got the Seafood Madness and it was also equally delicious! Seafood goodies covered in spicy peanut sauce. Wow! You yourself a favor and eat here!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I went for dinner after an outing together.  Many, many patrons order and pick up to take home but their dining area is really quite nice with convenient parking for the building in an adjacent lot. Service is attentive and knowledgeable about the menu, which is large for such a small place. Sushi, salads, curry, noodle bowls, pad Thai and pan fried dishes.  I have been here many times and was never disappointed. I recommend the soft shell crab appetizer or the spring rolls.  Soups are delicious and can be expanded to make a meal on their own. Tonight I had the Scallop and eggplant. A huge plate of food arrived with a mountain of rice on the side. I confess, it was so good that there was none to box up and take home.  I'm not a huge sushi fan but I can tell by the picturesque garnishes that someone back in the kitchen knows what they are doing here. No question that it would not disappoint you. They do have bar service and our water glasses were never more than a third empty.  Very reasonable price for the quality and presentation."}
{"text":"After years of having no Thai options really close to my place, it's nice to have two really good ones. Cravings is excellent, but Brown Sugar gives it a run for its money. We've had a duck dish that was perfectly crispy with a great spice level and crunchy veggies, really good dumplings, and my personal benchmark for Thai places -- tom kha gai, which was delightful. The place has beer and wine, but it's pretty spartan. What it's lacking in ambiance it more than makes up for in food."}
{"text":"I ordered for the first time today and I was definitely very satisfied! I ordered the coconut soup with shrimp, the crispy pad Thai with tofu, and the pad Thai with tofu. The soup coconut soup was very flavorful but the only negative was that it had only 2 small shrimps. The crispy pad Thai was delicious! It had a hint of sweetness and the flavor was perfect. The original pad Thai with tofu was good as well but I am used to having it more saucy and this was pretty dry. It still had flavor but just wish it had just a little bit more sauce. Great clean location! Excellent service! Will definitely be ordering from again!"}
{"text":"Very good for the price! Only had the Pad Thai dishes but it was some of the best I've had in a while. I would rate it above the other 4 or 5 Thia places on the west side."}
{"text":"I like the basil fried rice from here. It is amazing. It's a lot of food for what you get.. Friendly service and really beautiful decor inside. A little expensive which is why I took off a star.  Parking is a bit annoying but normal for lakewood. Just deal with it!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  I wish more people came here, I don't ever want it to leave/go out of business!   The food is delicious (I've tried masaman curry,  thai basil, and the drunken noodle). The ingredients are fresh and flavorful.  They're siam rolls are crispy and tasty too.  The employees are nice,  they remember us and our \"usual\" orders. The restaurant is clean and modern.  Go,  today!"}
{"text":"The Pad Thai is to die for. I am so addicted!  My daughter Caroline get it all the time now we have my husband hooked. I get chicken half spice and they get tofu quarter spice. So yummy! I could eat it everyday and never get sick of it. Give it a try you won't be sorry. And such nice staff. Also very clean. 5 stars for sure!"}
{"text":"I have tried Brown Sugar Thai twice since it opened - my first meal was fantastic and my second was horrendous, but I will go with four stars for now because I am optimistic.  I am vegan so for my first meal I tried the Green Garden with tofu. There was an awesome assortment of perectly cooked veggies and the tofu wasn't greasy . MMhusband was ogling my colorful food. I had brown rice on the side and the peanut sauce was tasty. Next time I would skip the combo...the soup and salad were not worth it.   Meal two was pad thai, hold the egg and fish sauce. It was awful, awful, awful. I have had vegan pad thai before, but something went wrong here. Everything tasted pickled - the noodles, the veggies. So. Bad. I saved it for my husband to taste and he agreed that it was disgusting. It also had practically zero veggies in it, and when you're ordering veg pad thai, it should!  I hope this place does well and takes note of reviewera comments so they can stick around for a long time!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was incredibly rude to me; I was merely sitting outside at one of their tables on a chilly day (mind you, NO ONE is eating here) and a woman stormed out and said if I did not plan on dining here I must move over ONE TABLE. I have heard awful things about the food here and now I have sworn off this place forever due to the ridiculous rudeness of a worker."}
{"text":"Don't understand the negative reviews of this place.  This and Sweet Mango in Strongsville are the two best thai places you will find around the Cleveland area.  Staff is extremely friendly.  I've had the crazy noodle, pad Thai, and basil fried rice.  All have been excellent.  Some people on yelp try to act like they are judges on iron chef.  Morons."}
{"text":"Ordered Siam rolls, awesome as usual. California Maki toll, good but it unraveled quickly. Needs to be done better. Orange chicken, I would give 7 out of 10. Needs to taste more chicken, not just fried crispy breading. Embarrassing that they use Lipton hot tea. All other Thai places may use the same but the don't tell you or show you that it is Lipton. Pricing we realized is a bit on the high side. Nice decor, but a bit nervous that this location could fail. There was two people there on a Friday night. Best part is the presentation."}
{"text":"I truly enjoyed the few times I have been to Brown Sugar Thai Cuisine.  This newer Thai restaurant is within walking distance of my parents place.  However, there IS parking but is shared with the businesses around it such as the juice bar next door to it so parking can be an issue depending on time.  Also, there is only about a dozen tables so it can get crowded as well.  With all of that aside, this is a wonderful place to sit and eat.  The bubble tea is absolutely decadent with the huge straws and tapioca seeds to make you feel like a kid again!  There menu is decent with several choices for lunch and dinner with the prices in the $10-$15 range (sometimes under $10 if you go during lunch).  This place will ALWAYS hold a special memory in my heart.  I took my mom here for Mother's Day dinner to introduce her to Thai food (What took you so long mom??).  I had her try my bubble tea and while she waited for her Beef Pad Thai to come out.  While waiting, my mom and I had an honest, heart warming and emotional conversation that I will ALWAYS remember as it was the FIRST time she actually saw me as her daughter Danielle.  Thank you Brown Sugar Thai Cuisine for an enjoyable meal that day with a memorable conversation and moment between us.  We look forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"Amazing. I had the garlic salmon. It was amazing!! Service was very friendly and price was pretty reasonable. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Awful, bland Thai food that was the worst I've ever had. Soup was absolutely disgusting. Spring rolls were bland and flavorless. My meal along with my girlfriend's meal were totally bland and flavorless. Absolutely disgusting and repulsive. We were starving, ate almost none of our food, and threw it all out. Completely lost our appetites. Never again. Way better options all around Lakewood like Banana Blossom. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"First time here! And it will not be the last! We are big Thai food fans. Don't let the little place fool you, it is jam packed with flavor!   The service was excellent! The servers were very attentive and even played with our 13 month old daughter ... Who happened to take her first step there!! Make sure you try the satay and the country style pad Thai."}
{"text":"Recently had takeout. Food was pretty good. I ordered the shumai and potstickers to start with and both were good. I just wish you would have got a bit more for the cost. The dipping sauce was very good and made both.  The chicken teriyaki was good, but very different than its Chinese cousin. The sauce was very thin. Portion size was good."}
{"text":"Love Love this Little Place...the cuisine is just wonderful so delicious the food presentation is beautiful as well! The staff is very friendly, restaurant is very nice and CLEAN and very accommodating, we have been here 3 times to dine in and have ordered takeout, they are consistent with their dishes. Delicious!! A MUST GO TO!"}
{"text":"Such a cute quiet place. Food is amazing. Staff is super friendly. Try the mango curry chicken and the coconut bubble tea. Amazing!"}
{"text":"Ordered food togo, the people were real friendly, but it took forever to get our order, which I didn't mind, but it wasn't that good.  Sushi was not great, and pad thai was actually pretty bad, 3 stars for the staff, if just based on food, would be 1 star."}
{"text":"This Thai place is a nice addition to bring some diversity to Lakewood. It's really a nice location and a nice spot.  However, in terms of food..... there's better places in Cleveland.  We stopped really late one night (close to closing time), and got seated right away. He ordered his typical pad thai- it was good, however, I feel like pad thai is one of those dishes it's hard to mess up on (kind of like fried rice). However, I still thought the pad thai was good.  I ordered the Tom Yum Noodle soup- the broth was good, and the soup itself was good. However, I found a hair in my soup. AAAH. Not a fan of that. And it disturbed me the rest of the night.  So, I thought the food was decent. Nothing like a thai place in Pepper Pike, but it was alright. Perhaps it was just  a fluke I found a hair in my soup. But I was pretty disturbed.   Next time, I'm not trying a soup! However, if you need some pad thai, this place has a decent good one!"}
{"text":"My partner and I went last night for dinner. It was our first time trying it out and lets just say that this morning, my first words when waking up were, \"Can we have Brown Sugar for dinner again tonight?!\". The food was delicious, good quality, and reasonably priced. The Pad Thai was delicious and I can't wait to try more of their food. What really stood out to me though was the stellar service! Everyone was smiling and attentive. They truly made you feel like you were in their home as dinner guest.  I am excited to add this restaurant into my list of favorites and to bring in some friends and family who have yet to try it! Great job Brown Sugar!! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Not bad, average Thai food. The chicken in my Pad See Yew was so dry and over cooked it was hard to eat. I can handle spice and asked for a 2/5 level and i could hardly eat it. Spice is relative, but this was definitely not a 2. Noodles were great, didn't notice the oiliness everyone has been talking about, so hopefully they fixed it. The staff was extremely nice!"}
{"text":"Popped in late last week for an early dinner as I was killing some time in the area.  It's tucked away down below the sidewalk but still easy to see if you're say walking on Detroit.    Nice space and really good service.  Food was terrific!  If I'm going to a Thai spot for the first time I usually choose between four dishes so I can determine legitimacy and no not pad thai...that's amateur hour.  Any sort of basil dish (kra-pow), drunken/crazy noodles, a curry, or Tom yum/Tom kha soup.  I chose the Tom Yum (sans coconut milk and just sour) with shrimp and the chicken basil (kra-pow) with the basic white jasmine rice.  Soup was nice and pungent and reasonably priced at $3.95.  Not too salty.  Chicken dish was awesome!  Huge portion and lots of chicken and onions/bell peppers.  The thai basil flavor was great and the dish tasted really clean and again not salty.  $12.95 and enough for two big meals.  I'm guessing it is way more food if you dine in as opposed to taking out.    *Heat warning*  Fellow masochistic heat enthusiasts...come here!  Novices...don't get what I got which was 4/5 heat scale.  Really freaking hot.  Both the soup and dish and I do habanero/ghost chile type stuff regularly.  Couldn't quite get through the whole soup.  Had to take most of the entree home.  Blew my face off and stomach was a little sore, ha.  But I asked for it!  Definitely didn't get Caucasian treatment or did I them sending a message?   Since I really didn't see any Thai chiles chopped up and floating around/lurking  I wasn't quite expecting the punch.  My guess is that with the 4 and 5s they are either adding some kind of potent pure extract or blending up some kind of gangster chiles into a smooth pulp/purée or similar and adding it to whatever so it is sort of disguised.  I'm definitely coming back but I'll probably get a 3!  My only issue and thus keeping this from a perfect review was that the place had a strong sort of basement/musty odor.  It's a modern-ish nice space but for whatever reason that day it smelled funky in there."}
{"text":"Henceforth this will be my go to Thai place in Cleveland.  I had lunch here with a friend on a Saturday and we ordered Panang curry and Basil fried rice with chicken. We went for a spice level of 3 on 5 and it was perfect. I went back the very next day and had Pad Thai which was also delicious. My issue with most Thai places is that meat is generally undercooked, but Brown Sugar does it right.   I like how this restaurant is very quiet and clean. More importantly, the service is very good. I'd definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Negative stars. Terrible customer service. Rude servers. Never again. The server was terribly rude it might be because she has a strong accent. But her tone was extremely rude. Worst service ever.   The food itself is mediocre.   I definitely recommend going Thai kitchen off of Madison. They are a thousand times better in food and service."}
{"text":"So-so for Thai food.  I've had better at other places and restaurants.  Some of which are no longer around.  So I have something to compare this place to. It has a comfortable atmosphere. It is lacking a bar - fyi. Or service started out slow. But later was fine when the food came out. Tofu and string bean dish was good.  But needed more of a bite or hot taste to it.  Had a nice sauce flavor.  But nothing spectacular.  I tried  the country pad thai and again, nothing to text home about.  The hot sour soup had some  nice heat to it. Lots of mushrooms in it.  I would suggest this place for lunch. Pretty much the same menu but cheaper prices and maybe   less proportions.   For this type of Asian food, I find Cuisine Du Cambodge on Lorain in Cleveland better."}
{"text":"How could all of you people have misled me so terribly? I only went to this place because all of you raved about it like Christ Himself was going to hold the second coming there. Why would anyone eat here? Ever? I had the Coconut Chicken Soup, the Tofu Triangles, and the Shrimp Pad Thai. I have had these foods before, many times. I know how they're supposed to taste. These were not good. They. Were. Bad. The soup was oddly sweet, the pad thai was dry. Dry! And the tofu was okay, but I think that was only by default. Didn't the Taiwanese invent Pad Thai? How did they screw this up? I so wanted to like this place. I wanted it to be my go-to place. It is not to be. I will not venture there again, no matter what any of you fellow Yelpers say. It was gross. ."}
{"text":"Yummy.   Sunday afternoon, decided to come here because Thai Kitchen wasn't open yet. And I do not regret it!   Friendly service. Pretty decor. Quiet. Clean.   Country Pad Thai - tangy, sweet, savory, chewy noodles, perfect amount of sauce/veggies/chicken. Will ask for spicier next time.   Drunken Noodles - BF ordered this & enjoyed it.   Coconut soup - very good. Definitely order this!   Kao Neow Sangayak - dessert. So. Freaking. Good. It was a sort of light but firm custard served with sweet sticky rice. Had to stop myself from licking the plate clean. Serving is large enough for 2 people to split.   The waiter even gave me a free sample of some wonton soup, perfect for the cold outside. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Very good thai food. I eat a lot, so I have to get multiple extras and it's a little expensive, but very good and very healthy. Cashew nut chicken and pad Thai aren't favorites.  The atmosphere is pretty nice at the lakewood location as well. The Rocky River location is a little lackluster but the food is still delicious at both."}
{"text":"I wanted to update my review because I had takeout from here tonight, and the food was SO MUCH better than it was the first time I tried it.  We ordered the Siam rolls, edamame for starters. I had the Green Garden and the hubs had one of the curries. Everything was cooked perfectly and had a nice flavor.    When I went in there to pick up our food, which was literally done within less than 10 minutes of calling, there was no one in the restaurant. But it was a Sunday night, so, that probably explains it.   I would order takeout from here again. And now that I've had better food, I would actually go there and eat in the restaurant again. It's a bit pricey, but it's so quick and just a bit of change-up from the \"I don't want to cook Panera run.\""}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the wanton soup here, the vegetables are tasty fresh and the broth is delish. I've had the pad Thai country style with large noodles that was great. I've had sushi (Lakewood roll) that I really enjoyed unexpected. The spring rolls are perfect. And I've had their Taro bubble tea which is good. Only thing I don't like that I've tried is the Pad Thai- I don't care for their flavor style. I've been here multiple times and would go back- the dining room provides a pleasant atmosphere, well furnished with music."}
