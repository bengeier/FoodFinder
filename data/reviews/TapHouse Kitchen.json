{"text":"Fantastic fresh beer, exquisitely prepared food - great deal for the price! Better key-lime tart than in Florida topped with real freshly whipped cream. Definitely going back before leaving town! Which we never do - usually like to try new places."}
{"text":"Great selection of beer but food is only so-so.  Pasta tasted like spaghetti-os. Good fish and chips. Sliders good but small.  Good service."}
{"text":"The signature burger is pretty great, but add the sweet potato waffle fries (to die for), a local brew (or three), and add the covered patio seating in early November and you have a place you want to come back to again and again (as I did three times over 9 days).  Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Had a fantastic Birthday Brunch at TapHouse Kitchen. Bill is a wonderful host. Great food, Great service, Great prices."}
{"text":"One person in our party ordered the short ribs. As he was eating it he noticed something in the meat. As we watched he pulled out a six inch piece of plastic from the meat. Yuck!  We never got an apology and they did not take anything off our bill. How sad!"}
{"text":"I was back in town visiting my Mom and a friend told me about this new place to check out in the neighborhood.  Went on a Saturday afternoon to watch the final game of the NBA playoffs.  Was greeted by Bill, who offered me a table.  I opted instead to \"belly up to the bar, drink a beer and watch the game\"!   I was immediately impressed with the decor, selection of beers on tap and friendless of the staff!  Great energy!  Unfortunately, I had just eaten, but the menu looked delicious!   Can't wait to eat some food during my next visit!  Aloha"}
{"text":"Brought the kids out.  The 11-yr old thought the wings were too spicy so the adults had to finish... He shoulda stayed with kids menu.  Apparently awesome fries though.  Salads were great.  Soup awesome.  Priced right.  Nice place."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch.  Sat at the bar, Alex waited on me.  She was super friendly and the service was prompt.    I ordered a glass of the Pinot Gris out of Oregon.  Was really good, and hit the spot!  Also got the soup of the day which was a potato, roasted chicken and herbs, broth type soup.  Was delicious!!  I also got the Cashew Chicken Salad sandwich.  Was outstanding.  I really enjoyed it all.  They're not cheap, and expect to drop $30-40 at least, but it's well worth it!!"}
{"text":"This place has it all-great food, cool atmosphere, tasty drinks, and GREAT FOOD! I would recommend Taphouse to anybody-good for a date night, chillin with friends, family dinner, whatever the occasion. The brunch is spectacular, happy hour is full of great deals, and, oh yeah, the food rocks!"}
{"text":"Really wanted to love this place:  it's a great concept, locally originated, wants to do well,  looks great, terrific vibe and hopefully they're still getting up to speed.  The missing piece is \"value\", not that it's expensive but it's what you get for the price.  There were no surprises as everything is described but 4 wings or 5 shrimp for an appetizer that tasted great and you want to share, so you'll need to order more and they're not inexpensive.  The flatbreads are  lavosch with toppings.  Meh.  As for the entrees, they looked and tasted great, but if you're a seafood/fish lover and want salmon, you should order the salad with salmon for $17, instead of the salmon entree for $25, as the serving on the salad is more appropriately sized for the entree and obviously if you're reading this you can figure out that we think that the entree portion was  too small.  Lots of great beers (tap house, right?).  Very nice and attentive staff  So we'll try it again and hope that they get the wrinkles out.    As I mentioned we wanted to love this place."}
{"text":"I've been here before when traveling for business and enjoyed the food and cocktails, but I had an even better experience today. Michelle, the bartender, gave me a great recommendation for dinner--chicken and dumplings. They're not the traditional southern way but with gnocchi. It was so good, and amazingly light. Plus, Michelle has a lovely bubbly personality---I can see why several regulars came in just to see her."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed the Tap House Kitchen a few times so far. I will certainly return.  I have brought in a few friends or co workers and I have hosted 2 events there with 10-15 people. Weather a small group or larger group we have all been very happy with the experience, service, food and drinks. I am so glad I work in the area, and found out about this new place. Thanks to the manager Bill and the staff, and server Jake(?),  they have always greeted me politely and made me feel welcome. Jen G"}
{"text":"Another great meal at Taphouse kitchen! Service was friendly and top notch as always."}
{"text":"I have to give this place 5 stars due to their fresh ingredients in their food. It's truly top notch. Not to mention the 20 beers on tap. It's better than I expected."}
{"text":"Ordered the creme brûlée French toast as it was one of the top rated dishes in the valley by Phoenix magazine. Coincidentally this was the first time I had ever been to TapHouse and it was pretty impressive. Seems like they have plenty of beers on tap, but being that it was brunch, I ordered the blood orange mimosa. The French toasted was not a let down at all and definitely satisfied my craving for dessert and breakfast. The potatoes are standard with their breakfast items but regardless, they're pretty tasty. The croque monsieur my partner ordered had plenty of ham and the cheese it was paired with was delicious. I'll definitely be back for dinner and to sample their beers."}
{"text":"We went there during happy hour. The food was very good. The place was so loud that it was an effort to talk to the rest of the party. I know that they think that loudness creates an ambience but it was painful to sit there we had to leave so we could have a conversation"}
{"text":"Love love looove this place. Great family atmosphere and awesome location, unique items on menu great staff working"}
{"text":"New favorite spot!! Been here a few times on the weekend for a beer and a light bite, but after attending a beer dinner with New Mexico Brewing Company, we are sold! What the chef whipped up that night was absolutely INSANE. Unless you have a major dietary restriction, trust the way the item is listed on the menu. Can't wait for football season to start so we have a place to hang with great beer and fun bartender!"}
{"text":"We had an outstanding meal with exceptional service.  This is a great place for a casual meal at reasonable prices. Will definitely be retiring soon."}
{"text":"Wide and varied menu, unique offerings, opportunity to go big, or stay on a budget. My walleye fish and chips were the best since Green Bay."}
{"text":"First day back in Arizona and it feels so good to be back.  Open air restaurant during the day, amazing food and drink specials during happy hour.  Restaurant decor is very cool industrial modern.  Had the angus sliders, wings and shrimp mac and cheese and a couple of local draft beers.  Everything was outstanding.  Key lime pie for dessert (DO IT!).  A great spot and can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Great happy hour! Hummus was delicious ! Garlic bread and fondue also was amazing! Pasta primavera was creamy and filling. The food looked beautiful when brought to our table..and tasted even better!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful brunch. The eggs Benedict were done perfectly and we really loved the way the coffee was presented. We are definitely planning on returning."}
{"text":"This 5 stars is based on what it is.  It is not a \"fine dining\" restaurant, but a casual dining place with excellent food and great service.  The crab cake is one of the best ever with a beautiful presentation.  Staff was efficient and friendly.  The main dining area is noisy, but the patio is much more quiet.  A neighborhood place we love to visit."}
{"text":"Just went for a quick app and drink for happy hour.. 4 soggy on the outside and dried out on the inside chicken wings for 6$(I know that cheap) but not good either way!! Our side of fries were forgotten as well good thing they weren't on the check. I won't be visiting again."}
{"text":"After a long day of travel this was just what we needed- amazing service, amazing beer, amazing food. The lamb pops were melt in your mouth good. The traditional burger was completely off the charts. We cannot recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"The food was okay -- just okay. They claim to be gluten friendly, but there are really only a VERY few gluten free options and my first server (they had a shift change) didn't have much info on what other menu items could be modified, nor did she seem interested in finding anything out for me. Our second server was more friendly, but he did little more than settle up our bill.  The main reason for the poor review, however, is that the restaurant hours showed a closing time of 10:00 pm, yet at 9:00, the place was very empty, and the staff started doing close-up procedures all around us. It was awkward. There were no offers to refill our drinks or see if we needed anything else. At 9:30, we were told \"Sorry ladies, we're closing up now so you'll have to leave\" -- a full 30 minutes prior to closing time. I wasn't going to argue, but it was extremely rude. I had a friend in Scottsdale from out of state, and I was embarrassed that I had taken her there. HIGHLY doubt I'll ever go back."}
{"text":"The menu was right on and unlike the Herb Box the Tap House Kitchen even has a kids menu. The server helped me to understand the difference between Croque Monsieur and Croque Madame naturally I chose the Madame due to this assignment specifically, since that will include a sunny side up egg right on top for just a $1.00 extra. Everything came out hot and amazing. Dominic our waiter was right on task and very accommodating to our requests and needs. Even the iced coffee they don't have but made sure to serve with a smile. Croque Madame consists of black forest ham, gruyere, and béchamel sauce and topped with a perfectly good egg on the top. A wonderful use of sauces to accentuate the eggs and sandwich it tasted like heaven on sourdough bread.  A great use of herbs and spices bring out the flavors in the meat and cheeses. This dish was all the way to gourmet a rich sauce that enveloped the Croque Madame was light and savory. The flavors of the Croque Madame were fresh and innovated with a sunny side up egg as its crowning jewel.  This restaurant does fantastic by using the best and freshest local ingredients on all their dishes it allows the eater to truly enjoy their dish. The flavors are harmonies light with a hint of sweetness from the little gem vine ripened tomatoes and caramelized shallots. The delicate béchamel sauce is like silk on the tongue.  The gruyere is a firm pace yellow cheese with a slight nutty flavor from France. This dish reminded me of almost sitting in a cafe in France. Compliments to Chef Patrick, all the employees, and Bill, way to go, Tap House Kitchen!!!"}
{"text":"My go to place for taking out of town guests with unknown food tastes. The variety in both food and drink is the best. Additionally, one of the few places with weekend Happy Hour pricing.  Can't say enough about the food; lamb pops, chicken and dumplings and turkey meatballs on risotto were all great!"}
{"text":"Love the Taphouse. Great food great selection huge draught beer selection and a great covered patio. Staff is excellent try their martinis!"}
{"text":"I've only been here for brunch. The build your own bloody bar keeps me coming back! Also, the food is really good. I love a menu with good, limited options and fresh ingredients. I mean, this is no IHOP and I appreciate this gem, which is located in a typical Scottsdale shopping center."}
{"text":"This place has a pretty neat atmosphere and a closed in patio that I really love.  I really like when the patio is open because then it isn't as loud in the restaurant.  The food is pretty good, but nothing to write home about.  I usually try something new each time, and I've been slightly disappointed most times, but I really like their salads.  The service is good, I've never had to wait too long to be helped, and I feel like their servers are really on their toes and aware of the needs of their tables.  The tap selection is really awesome, I like how many different beers they have on tap, and they seem to change on a regular basis.  The wine on tap is a great feature as well when you're feeling a little more fancy!  Another nice thing about TapHouse is that you can make reservations, so if you're going out with a group and you don't want to wait, they can accommodate you.  I would recommend this place to anyone in the direct area looking for an easy place to eat without much of a wait of any.  If you're looking for great food however, I would recommend somewhere closer to Old Town."}
{"text":"We ate dinner at the place several times and it was always consistent and absolutely delicious! Yesterday we came in for brunch and I must say I was blown away, the French toast was THE BEST I'VE EVER HAD!! Mimosas are available with a variety of juices, coffee is very good too!! The service was always great, seems like the staff really enjoys working there :-))  You HAVE to try that place, as for me, I cant wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Hands down, the best brunch spot in the entire valley, IMO.  While they have great burgers, wings and an awesome selection of beer and whisky, their brunch is what makes this place so great.  If you are in the area, are looking for something new to try or are just curious to try the best egg Benedict on the planet, do yourself a favor and stop by.  Please be aware, this is not your typical Scottsdale, drunken, d-bag brunch spot so go there if you want to have a great meal with good company.  Very cute interior.  Staff is always nice and attentive.  They do a bloody mary bar and have a great selection of mimosas if that's your poison.  Oh, and the shrimp mac-and-cheese is a must!"}
{"text":"The service was horrible. Mark was our waiter, long story in bullet points.  -One was not ready to order from our party and he said \"well you need to order now\" -He slammed our drinks down when he served us. -He came back to us after running our card and some tipped saying \"hey guys so was my service good? So then why was i not tipped so good? I should have just added 20% to all of your bills but i didn't because I wanted to be nice.\" -He told us to NOT COME THE F**** BACK. We were not done tipping, we had partially tipped on our cards and we were doing the rest in cash. -We had all kept calm and as we were leaving one of us turned around to ask who the owner was and he came at her saying to GET THE F OUT I AM THE F******* OWNER as he proceeded to yell in her face.  - He locked the doors behind us with customers still in the restaurant while they were open."}
{"text":"Best Burger ever !!! Very juicy , buns were soft . My type of burger .   I'm a big critic when it comes to food . This burger won me over . I've been all over . This is by far the best burger I've had"}
{"text":"Wow. I had the barbeque pork sliders with avacado and slaw on a rye bun.  Great presentation. And it tasted awesome too.  I was not expecting the taste of the toasted rye bun complementing the barbecue. What a nice surprise!"}
{"text":"The food here is excellent! Kid friendly great kids menu also. Had a meat and cheese plate that was awesome went well with my Taphouse Mule! We r coming back again everything on menu looks and is soooo good!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are huge fans of this new place! We just went here for happy hour on a Sunday afternoon.  (They have happy hour 7 days a week from 3-6 with a variety of $6 food options). Jake, our server, was great and made excellent recommendations. We just tried their Shrimp Mac-N-Cheese, Prosciutto & Fig Flatbread, and Apple Brie Flatbread. I think I may have dreams about that amazing Mac-N-Cheese! Yum! The flatbread was different--it was more of a cracker than what you usually get with flatbread but also delish!  Both types of flatbread were very tasty! Also, I had the Moscow Mule, which was excellent and served in authentic copper mug. The hubby drank the Orange Blossom beer, which we both love. I miss the restaurant that previously occupied this space, but this dinner was so good tonight that I may not miss it as much now."}
{"text":"Nice addition to the area.  Casual and comfortable setting with an inviting patio.  Good selection of micro brews on tap including several Arizona selections.  Beer flights available. Menu offers beer and wine pairings with each item which was helpful. I had the fish fry which came with a light and crispy batter, piping hot with good fries. Wife had the grilled salmon which was expertly prepared. Homemade desserts including ice cream and a key lime tart with wonderful graham cracker crust were excellent. Tim was a knowledgeable and attentive server.  Concrete floor and hard surfaces can challenge conversation and negate the background music, but typical of a bustling place. We'll be back to try the happy hour."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is awesome. It has a modern feel to it. Very clean restaurant and the service is great! I had the Taphouse Signature Burger and it was very juicy...cooked perfectly. Also, their mac-n-cheese is delicious! Probably one of the best mac-n-cheese that I have had. You can really tell that everything is fresh. It's a great place to hang out with friends. And for all you whiskey lovers....they have whiskey on tap!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The place looks great, service was good, disappointed though poor value, I ordered the wedge and steak, my wife's scallop was larger than my steak no joke, $20 bucks , if it was some prime fillet ok but really,"}
{"text":"I complained to a manager because one of the servers was talking with him and flipping her hair around and it made me feel that things weren't clean and I didn't want to watch. He said in a very nasty way that if I didn't like it I didn't have to watch. My friend and I were shocked by the way he handled the situation and we will never go there again.It appears that he was the operating manager."}
{"text":"Unfortunately for me I asked the server for something spicy and didn't even look at the menu. He suggested the seafood pasta and even said it was his favorite.   Bad call. The seafood was ok, the pasta was fresh, and I think it would have been worth the $33 but the problem was the sauce was from a can with a cartoon chef on it. It was sugary, pasty, bland, and as far from spicy as fruit loops are. It kinda felt like the server got a bonus for pushing that shitty dish out the door that late on a Saturday. Ick  If you don't have a spicy dish, that's ok. Just say so and I'll have the walleye (which my wife loved).   Won't go back. Also tired of new strip mall designs THAT ARE SO HARD AND LOUD THAT I HAVE TO SHOUT WITH MY TABLE. Move the kitchen out of the dining room for gods sake."}
{"text":"Disappointed :( I have no problem spending my hard earned money on a great meal...however this was just OK. Our service was just OK. The food was just OK. I felt like the value in general was poor. 16 bucks for a burger a LA carte. And $4 per side. The fish was nothing more than what I have experienced else where. I will say the bar provides a wonderful variety of taps and choices. THE MULES ARE GREAT! Highlight of my entire $100 meal...honestly"}
{"text":"Update to my previous review- I had my birthday brunch at Taphouse this past Sunday. While the food was great as usual when it was served they gave EVERYONE their food BUT ME. I asked where it was and the waitress said it would be just a minute. 10 minutes later they brought my food and it was not what I ordered. The waitress apologized and said she would get my food quickly. 20 min later after watching table after table being served their food. I again asked where my food was. I also asked to speak to the manager. The manager never came to speak to me, however 10 min later he brought my food set it down and said nothing. The waitress was kind and apologetic and I was not charged for my meal, however the way the whole situation was handled was ridiculous.   Restaurant 101 when you forget someone's order (especially twice)  that should be the next thing to go out before anything else. I really hope this place can get its service together. I was really disappointed as I every other time I've been there has been a good experience."}
{"text":"Great food! Rustic/industrial interior with tons of beers on tap and 3 whiskeys on tap. Good happy hour prices. Ordered the sliders, shrimp Mac and cheese, prosciutto flatbread. I recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"Had Bree as my server. She was the sweetest! I was in a rush and she did an amazing job making sure I got in and out. The food and beer were great! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I have entered a new phase in life. I now judge a restaurant by how easy it is to bring in a stroller, a diaper bag, blankets, toys, and any other miscellaneous items.   How big is the bathroom? Does it have a diaper changing station? Can the waiters \"handle\" a table that has infants and parents that are NOT ordering off the alcohol menu?   Well the Taphouse passed today!   My good friend and I stopped by for lunch and it was a nice experience. We were seated quickly, accommodations were made for high chairs, and our server was quick to attend us.   I had the Clam Chowder, as it was the SOTD and it was delicious! I also had a hot coffee that was served in a nice glass mug.   My friend ordered a burger that looked great and some sides for her little boy.   The atmosphere was nice and I am sure we will be back.   Oh, and they do have one changing table in the large stall!"}
{"text":"Good Happy Hour menu selection and pricing but the normal menu prices are too high considering other options near by.   Good service and nice patio area in winter time."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Great customer service and some of the best food in town. Be sure to visit when Michele is bar tending, you will never have better service. Amazing"}
{"text":"Great happy hour selection. Highly recommend the sliders with duck eggs. Great atmosphere with friendly staff"}
{"text":"We've been here 3 times before and enjoyed the food but last night was so disappointing that future visits are in doubt. Sliders were bone dry, Sherry Berry salad came with bleu cheese although I specifically asked that it not, and a bottle of beer came totally flat and they said the others were flat as well. When the salad came back, the taste was off-putting and I just left it untouched. Too many misses to go unnoticed.  Lastly the server seemed to want credit for deducting the flat beer from the check."}
{"text":"I think my wife and I found our new favorite restaurant. We were in the area to see a local magic show and decided to try a new restaurant. We were so happy we did because it was such a wonderful experience. The service was top notch and the food was incredible. The desserts are delicious also. We had the red velvet cake. We can't wait to go try other things next time."}
{"text":"The decor alone put this place on my top restaurants list. The Edison light bulbs really class up this joint. We had great service, our server was attentive and gave great recommendations.   We did the tastings for two menu and were pleased. The house sliders were delicious and featured a quail egg on top. We each got a drink to accompany our meals, Papago Orange blossom is a light fruity beer with a smooth finish and an Odell IPA with subtle hop flavor.  The chicken dumplings and the fish and chips are tasty. I recommend both dishes.   We finished off our meal with a chocolate layer cake and mint chocolate chip ice cream that was a sharing portion. Already  I plan on returning!"}
{"text":"CHECK YOUR BILL CAREFULLY! I have been to THK twice and love their beers and some of their food. My wife and I were there with another couple on July 18th.  We were  seated by an experienced waiter who took our order. He then told us that a new waitress would be taking over. We repeated our order and asked them, up front, to give the two couples separate checks. They said that was not a problem. The other couple suggested that perhaps it would help to keep the orders separate from the start. The waitress said that was not necessary. Now we are not used to going over our bills in detail, but the bill presented to the other couple was so high we were puzzled. Guess what? They billed $100 for less than $50 worth of food/drink. And it took two attempts to get it fixed.  Worse, I went and mentioned the problem to the manager.  I did not ask for any concession or \"freebies\", but did suggest that he go and speak to the couple who had been overcharged.  I  then observed the manager during the rest of our time at THK. He was either talking/joking with staff or expediting food orders. THK was about 30% full so it was not that he was in a rush.  He  did whiz by our table once to drop off a food item, but said not a word to anyone.  I might give THK one more try...but I will sit at the bar."}
{"text":"A colorful environment friendly staff. I enjoined the atmosphere. Drinks are delicious \"mule\". Food I will have to come back for more!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in the immediate area! Everything is great from their fish fry (everyday!) to the shrimp Mac, but maybe the lamb pops are the best thing on the menu. Staff is friendly and the owners are great. One of the top restaurants in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"I have been a semi regular to the tap house. It's a new establishment. It is clean. I like the bar. The owners seem to be there often and I like that, because it makes it seem like they care. Costumer service could be better, the best costumer service I've gotten was from one of the busboys. I like the fact that they have a Saturday brunch. Also they have a daily special which so far have been great. Today I got jambalaya special, it was tasty and filling. I also got the key lime pie and it was phenomenal."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar on Wednesday night - decent beer selection, nice atmosphere.  Ordered the halibut special.  It was an incredibly small piece - roughly 2 inches square - with no sides (served over a sort of tomato coulis).  Worse than the portion size was the fact that whatever seasoning they put on top was sooo salty, it completely overpowered the delicate halibut and all I tasted was salt.  I let the bartender/server know about it, but got little response.  Then came the bill:   $35 for the halibut.  Are you kidding me  --  this is not the Ocean Club or Eddie V's!   I again complained to the bartender/server about the portion size, the poor preparation due to the over-seasoning and the exorbitant price.  She said she would check with her manager.  When she returned to the bar area she just resumed what she was doing without saying anything to me.  I called her over and asked her if she had talked to the manager.  Yes, she had.  Well, what did he say?  He said that if you want to ask for him to come over, he would come over to talk to me.  Really?!?  At no time did the manager come over, offer any apologies or explanation or even acknowledge that he had an unhappy customer.    Poor service.   Poor food preparation.  Exorbitant price.  Horrible management."}
{"text":"Went for the Bloody Mary bar and it was just ok.  Their website said they had bacon...no bacon.  I asked the waitress about the bacon and she just shrugged her shoulders and gave me a blank stare.  They had a crumb of beef jerky left....I asked for more...nothing ever came.  For a great Bloody Mary bar....go to Hash Kitchen.  Their food was good though."}
{"text":"We've never been here - but friends had mentioned dinner here. So glad we made the drive. Food, service and atmosphere were exceptional. I had the clam chowder and steak & wedge, delicious! We will be back again - want to try the chicken and dumplings!"}
{"text":"Best Burger Ever! I've been a fan of Houston's & Hillstone's burgers but the first bite of Taphouse's  brought the yummmm! Smokey grill flavor with all the toppings. If you do it, you pick the fries on the side, perfectly golden & crisp.  Great monthly calorie treat! We'll be back ;-)"}
{"text":"On business travel and was so happy with this restaurant!  Ate a simple salmon salad and it was so delicious!  Salmon, fresh greens, cucumbers, nectarines, grapefruit, candied walnuts, with orange blossom vinaigrette.  I ordered the Odell IPA (draft) which I love.  So nice to have a Colorado brew while in Phx.  Yum!  Inside was laid back, good music playing but not too loudly.  Waitress (Savannah) was extremely friendly, nice and attentive but not too attentive.  Great service."}
{"text":"First time going there, I usually eat by myself so I went in there and the hostess looked at me funny when I said just one, she asked me if I wanted to sit at the bar to get a full service, I don't understand why she said that, I declined the offer saying I don't like the bar, so then again she gave me a weird look like I said something crazy or something.  She sat me in a booth, inside the dining area, that's actually where I wanted to sit.  The patio was somewhat busy but not the inside area.  When the hostess sat me, I said It was my first time there what would she recommend, she actually was nice at this part and suggested a few things.  I saw waiters walking by and waitresses on the other side of the salon looking at me, so I know everyone saw me but none of them cared to even acknowledge me or even smile, I was getting anxious cause I was really hungry, looking at the menu for about 5 min that actually felt like 30 with no one coming to my table to even offer water..  point being. I got up and left. Still hungry and thirsty.  It's beyond me how any restaurant would treat people like this.. if it's busy I can understand, a little smile and a hello really goes a long way, you can just say I'll be right with you, or somebody will be right with you, but when they act like you are not there when it's not even busy really gets on my nerves. Hey if you want to go there and be treated like you are invisible go ahead you probably will love that place!"}
{"text":"Location and atmosphere are good. Service was stoic...not warm and inviting. I am a warm, friendly and appreciative diner....I know wait staff work hard....but I also don't want to feel like I am an imposition by ordering a meal.   Food is good....but I don't get the artificial air of trying to be upscale for a beer pub. $8 for 4 chicken wings?  Three Sliders the size of a 50 cent piece and open face?  For the price, it feels ridiculously underwhelming and like we are being served tiny rations on a free tasting menu....not full orders of things.   Again, the food was tasty....not killer...but not bad. The kale is great, by the way. It just felt like you receive about 1/3 of what you would get anywhere else of similar quality for the price.   Bummer.   Again"}
{"text":"The food, drinks and service here are just great. Emily rushed our order to the bar just as happy hour was ending in order to take advantage of the reduced prices.  My wife had the burger with a side of roasted asparagus and I had the short ribs and risotto. Both dishes were perfectly prepared. The burger, done medium, was juicy and wonderful. The boneless short ribs atop the risotto were falling apart tender.  The beer selection was extensive. It appealed to both my sour and IPA pallet. My wife was impressed by the seasonal Oktoberfest from Odell.  Emily was a fantastic waitress!  As new customers, we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came here the other day with a friend for lunch. I got the burger and fries and he got a sweet potato stuffed shrimp sliders on special that day. We both enjoyed our meals and the beautiful presentation on the plates. It was also very nice to have such a wonderful prompt server, a male with a shaved head. He was very informative about the menu and suggestions he gave us. Thank you for your great service. Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"My new favorite place to eat!!! The food was seriously incredible. The service was top notch and the menu was amazing. I will definitely come back and I will tell all my friends and family. Our server Ben was prompt, always kept our drinks filled and offered amazing suggestions for us to try since it was our first time. I found out the owners and managers wife makes all the deserts herself by scratch and they were so delicious. Everything was fresh, almost too beautiful to eat and generous  portion sizes. We can wait to go back and try more menu items!!"}
{"text":"The menu is getting to be very old. Nearly the same from my review 2 1/2 years ago.  Not much new and seems to have lost some of what was good about Tap House.    Food quality and preparation isn't what it used to be.  Initially thought of lowering rating to a 3, but giving the benefit of the doubt will rate a 4."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar and had drinks before a dinner reservation down the street. Great spot to sit, menu looked really good. Locally owned and the restauranteur and chef was checking every order coming off the line before it was served.  Next time we're in town, we'll eat here."}
{"text":"Called in advance to find out what time they closed, I am a local with peeps in town, and was told 9:30.  Got there at 9:20 with a reception of a female with a very bad attitude who told me they were no longer serving food.  After informing her I called in advance received a snarky look and telling me they were closed for food I felt compelled to let others know the experience.  Have had fantabulous meals there but beyond disappointed as a regular with this experience.  Now at Houston's enjoying an amazing meal.... Too bad there is not a zero rating as a result of this pathetic experience...."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE service.  Both the seemingly teen aged hostess and the cocky, smart mouthed waiter.   I can't believe they hire such idiots.  Food was so-so, typical for Scottsdale.  No reason to go back."}
{"text":"I went to the taphouse tonight with a couple friends. I had the salmon which was delicious and fresh. my friends had a hamburger and steak and really enjoyed it. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anybody"}
{"text":"Wow. This was our first time visiting the restaurant. We sat at the end of the bar for happy hour. The staff was immediately welcoming and the bartender offered to chill our wine instead of just giving us ice which is what normally happens at other places.  We ordered the Stella Artois Beer Cheese Fondue for our app. It comes with the most delicious  crusty garlic bread for dipping. The cheese is a bit thinner than most, but i really enjoyed that. It did not get all thick and clunky as we ate. The flavor was spot on! We had the pleasure of meeting two of the owners, one being the chef.  After discussing the menu he recommended the lamb pops. My mom does not like lamb, but he brought us a taste anyway. She was won over for sure! They were absolutely perfect. His favorite dish is the Chicken and Dumplings so of course we had to try that as well. We split the order. The dumplings are actually light and fluffy homemade gnocchi! The dish was so unique and flavorful.  I cannot wait to return to this very friendly and absolutely delicious establishment!"}
{"text":"Very good food and service! They were very accommodating for a group of 9. Service was excellent and he was very attentive to our group as well as his other tables. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Service was great.  Food very tasty fish and chips.  When the bill came $2.50 for bread????really.  Men's room no soap how do the workers Wash their hands? I told the manager and he appeared in no rush to fix the situation"}
{"text":"There is nothing worse than being greeted by a rude bartender #totalturnoff. We were here on a little get away and were trying a few different restaurants while here. Everywhere was so friendly, but this place. We arrived at 5:58. Waited a few minutes with zero acknowledgement yet, she walked by a few times. Once she made it our way, I kindly asked if it was still happy hour, which my watch indicated it was. She said \"no, it was over\". What a way to treat patrons there to spend money #not. We chose to leave and try a place that treats their customers well!! Back to Paul Martin's a second time in 3 days because their staff treated us well and their food was delicious."}
{"text":"This place is simply great. We were staying in the neighborhood and wanted a place with a decent menu within walking distance. We hit the jackpot here. Extensive beverage options whether you are into wine or cocktails or of course beer. The Stella cheese fondue was perfect. Our steaks were done exactly as we ordered. The  chocolate peanut butter pie was as great as you can imagine (add toffee crumble while you are imagining so you get it right).  The icing on the cake, so to speak, was our waitress Haley(sp?). She was spot on with being attentive but not intrusive. Could not have done better.   Definitely check this place out when in the area."}
{"text":"The French toast was over fill with sweetness. It was a snapchat/Insta worth. It was delicious, but I wasn't able to finish it. My coworkers got the fish and chips, grilled cheese, Mac and cheese, and hamburger and those were all good. It took awhile to get water refill though :("}
{"text":"I keep coming back for that Jerked Chicken salad... has become by far my favorite salad around town."}
{"text":"The only reason this review isn't 5 stars is because of food prices. Everything else was phenomenal!  We went to TapHouse kitchen this past weekend for a friends birthday. Our server Jessie was perfect! she genuinely seemed interested in our table, helping us decide on food, and bringing out a birthday dessert. As a former server I know sometimes all your customers can look the same and you are focused on turning tables and being efficient, but her cheerful and sweet attitude was awesome! It definitely added to the experience!  The food was excellent- I got the burger with truffle potatoes as my side and both were fabulous. My husband got the halibut dinner special which he said was some of the best fish he's ever had. My only issue was it seemed a tad overpriced (fish was $32 and platter of 4 medium turkey meatballs is $20) but the food was honestly so good it won't keep me from going back, lol! I'll just be mentally prepared to spend a little more next time"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. Went with 3 coworkers (we are from Philadelphia) on a break from a conference we were attending. Waitstaff was fast, efficient, and pleasant. We were seated right away and even though it was busy the food came out fast. Everyone at the table really enjoyed what they ordered: tap house salad, mac n cheese, sweet potato fries, Reuben sandwich, mushroom soup, burger and the sliders. I would recommend this to a friend and I plan to go back this week for dinner before I go back to the east coast."}
{"text":"My husband ordered short ribs and they came out with a huge piece of plastic under the meat.  Sent back, brought a new one.  No apologies, no price reduction.   Not likely coming back"}
{"text":"Took new comers to Taphouse last night.  I bragged about the clam chowder and short ribs all the way to the restaurant.  When we got there we found the short ribs had been removed from the menu.  What!  This was the best entre.  Also, the clam chowder which used to be filled with clams, potatoes and bacon was a bland concoction.  Very little clams and lack of seasoning.  Tasted like a thick white cream sauce.  The diced vegetables were crisp meaning they were probably added as an afterthought before servicing.  The kitchen really botched this batch of chowder.  What a disappointment."}
{"text":"Best first visit ever; Corey was our waiter, which made the first visit even better. Great server! The honey chiplote Wings I ordered for Lunch were excellent! Cant wait to come back for dinner and have one of them beers!"}
{"text":"We went here for a work happy hour. The beer selection was great and the happy hour specials were pretty decent. The servers were friendly, but not as attentive as I would have liked. When ours brought a beer that was wrong, we had to wait 15 minutes for her to come fix it. Other than that, the place was great. I will be going back to try the food next time."}
{"text":"Our server Natalie was less than desirable poor beer selection. Food over priced 22 dollars for 4 meatballs. 20 dollars for fish and chips. Which was mostly batter.    And the best was the flying bugs landing and beer   Save your money!! So many better places to eat and grab a beer"}
{"text":"We were in Scottsdale on a family vacation and came across this place on Yelp.  We loved it!  They have a great kids menu.  We had the chicken wing appetizer, a salad and the fish and chips and all were incredible. Their tartar sauce is hands down the best tartar sauce we had ever tasted in our life!  About half way through our meal, one of the owners came to our table to make sure all was well. He stopped by several times and was very attentive and such a great guy!  I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Best fish and chips I've had in forever with perfect beer pairing. My new favorite place!"}
{"text":"Arrived just before happy hour was over and server was great about getting our order in on time. The decor is fantastic and I like the design of the patio space which makes it usable in the summer. I wish the happy hour was a little longer though as it's not realistic to be able to make it during the week. I saw though that they also have brunch on weekends which I'll be back for!"}
{"text":"We were staying at the Hilton next door and passed by this place during lunch. Gave it a shot because of the raving Yelp reviews and the lovely outdoor seating they had. It was on a weekday so it wasn't busy at all. We were seated and served promptly and our food and drinks came out fairly quickly. In fact, everything was so good, we came back that evening for dinner.  Many great menu options.. I opted for salads both times and they were both really good and super fresh and huge portions. We also had a couple of their beer flights as they have really great beer selections. Got to chat with the owner Bill and turns out he's originally from OC! Super friendly, down to earth guy. Overall, great place to have a quick lunch and will return again next time we're in town."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places. Friendly staff that actually remember us and our preferences. They stock Drambuie so my husband can have his rusty nails. The predator wine is my favorite.  Charcuterie is our go to appetizer but the dinner good is wonderful also.   Nice patio seating also. So much nicer than the Hustons in the same complex.  More like a neighborhood place."}
{"text":"Tried this place out and it didn't disappoint!  There was a nice selection of food, beer and wine!  I had the hamburger salad, which was delicious! If you're paleo or gluten-free, you will find something to eat here!   There is a nice and casual atmosphere with great service, and a great place to have a meal!"}
{"text":"Once we found out about TapHouse, we never considered eating in our hotel bar again.   I'm serious.   Upscale but relaxed, trendy but mellow, this place is a great example of what excellent food and service should be, all bundled up in an atmosphere where you can wear your flip flops or a fancy dress - or both.   To say we loved this place is an understatement.   First of all, the food - we were at happy hour or here mid-day I think 4 days in a row? In a city where there are so many awesome restaurants, that's an attestation of excellence.  GET THE CHICKEN WINGS.  Yes, there are only 4. But they will fill you up because they are gigantic wings, that are perfectly cooked without breading (yes!) with a beautiful buffalo sauce with a hint of honey that pairs so well with the maytag blue cheese drizzle they come with.  They were so good I forgot to take pictures.  And we ordered them again.  And I again forgot to take pictures. Trust me, they speak for themselves. The fondue (Fon-don't-you-dare!) is also stellar. Be forewarned, if you are sensitive to spicy foods, the fondue bread comes with a little heat. But my goodness, the sauce, and the crispiness of the bread... aw yes.  We also were delighted by their crabcake, and their burger.  Do it. Just go here.   Beer selection: well-rounded and delicious. I had a double IPA whose name was FYITM (I'll let you figure out what that acronym stands for), and suggestions following that beer were excellent and spot on.   Service: Bartenders were fantastic. Super fun, super polite, and very knowledgeable of their product.   Absolutely, go here if you want the trifecta of 5 star food, 5 star beer/drinks and 5 star people - all with a clean, relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today with my mom. She ordered the hamburger (just calling it a burger is just not right) with coleslaw and I had the Cuban with sweet potatoes fries. Both were superb and I'd order both again... Yes... Mom and shared. But the hamburger was off the charts. Probably, sincerely the best burger ever. Delicious soft bun, meat cooked perfectly and seasoned just right. Gooey cheese and and other ingredients and well... I think that's what I call heaven. The coleslaw was delicious ! The Cuban? Yummy!!!!! I couldn't put it down. I personally despise pickles but the ones on the sand which added a crunch and awesome flavor I just had to eat them. Mom and I both said we will most certainly be back. I had a white sangria that was so fruity and delicious it was hard to not hAve two....but we had shopping to do. The service was really great and the chef / owner came out to say hello. Amazing place and cannot wait to go back !"}
{"text":"BEST DINING EXPERIENCE I'VE EVER HAD! I cannot believe how amazing the food was. We ordered the Arizona Raised Prime New York Steak and the Taphouse Signature Burger with Mac n' Cheese as the side. The steak comes with the Yukon gold parmesan truffle potatoes (incredible) and a Maker's Mark maple bacon glaze (perfectly crafted). Never have I had a steak cooked so perfectly and paired so well with the potatoes and the glaze. The burger was so balanced in all the flavors and was so perfect. The Mac n cheese was fantastic too. Then we ordered dessert. We got a scoop of their housemate Pistachio ice cream and the brownie. The ice cream was heavenly. The chocolate brownie came with chocolate ice cream. We ordered sliced strawberries and paired it with the chocolate. My dad hates the texture of strawberries, but the flavor combo was so divine, he even ate two bites! Lastly, our server Alan was INCREDIBLE. So relaxed, attentive, helpful, intuitive, personable, and in touch with everything. BEST DINING EXPERIENCE I'VE EVER HAD. PERIOD."}
{"text":"This review is SO over due! We moved to Scottsdale from Chandler a lil' over a year ago and have been regs at TapHouse since last summer...love TapHouse! It's the 'Cheers' place you go to for chilling-out with regs w/o pretentiousness! The entire staff is so friendly and accommodating. Food/drink is 100% consistent w/out a ginormous bill! The Manager, Matt is hands-on and always helping to make it a smooth ride for all...such a sweetheart. I worked in the industry a long time ago but never met a mgr, so kind as Matt. Btw, he enjoys to golf so, ask him about his game! Chef Patrick is an amazing chef and great guy who rocks the kitchen...he puts the 'Rock' into the Rock Shrimp 'n Mac!! He checks all food going out b4 it's served to make sure it's 100% TapPerfect! Michel, Damian and Juan bring the bar alive while Natalie, Haley and Jessica are wonderful servers (I'm leaving a few out)but tip them all well! Yes, you'll be also LOVE TapHouse but only you can decide to do it and enjoy it!! ENJOY!!"}
{"text":"The only reason I am not giving this place 5 stars is because their service is hit or miss. I have had some really good service and also pretty bad service, but other than that I love this place. It has a nice patio area (even though you're view is of a parking lot) and the decor is really cool, overall great atmosphere. I wasn't expecting much of their food the first time I came to this place, I thought it would be typical bar food, but everything I've had has far exceeded my expectations. I've been back several times and haven't had a bad meal. Their sliders are awesome, so is their Mac and cheese. I would also recommend going for their brunch. The food is amazing and they have great drink specials."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in Scottsdale. It's unpretentious and yet inventive and delicious.  It appears to be a sports bar but it's actually a chef driven hidden gem.  Love it!"}
{"text":"Fabulous burgers and delish salads.  Lots of fun beers and wines, also. Very nice personnel. Great atmosphere. What's not to love?"}
{"text":"Went for the Everyday Fish Fry. Boring, bland fish. Thought it was going to be WAY better. Fish was mushy and thickly breaded. Probably won't recommend or go back unfortunately."}
{"text":"Aside from the lamb pops, an unspectacular meal for the four of us. We will still to keeping their  weekend brunch on our upcoming outings."}
{"text":"Great beer selection and one hell of a good burger. Great service, but then again, I knew my bartender/server...he's the reason I went to check it out in the first place."}
{"text":"Very odd .... We have tried to go 3 times on the weekend and on 2 occasions they were having a Private Event, at Lunch.. REALLY?? Owner(s) seem a bit flippant... \"Sorry, we are closed for a Private Kentucky Derby Event for our Contractors\"...Again.. REALLY??? This is a neighborhood place that isn't available to the neighborhood. I will say that the 1 time we did get in the food was ok, a little pricey, but OK."}
{"text":"First time at TapHouse. Good selection of craft beers, which my fiance and I enjoy. Our bartender, Michelle, was very knowledgeable and provided food recommendations. We had the shrimp mac-n-cheese and sliders. The mac-n-cheese was amazing! Chunks of shrimp w/3 cheeses. The sliders aren't your normal sliders. They are on a 1/2 brioche bun topped w/a quail egg and bearnaise sauce. We plan on coming back again."}
{"text":"I would describe the Tap House and a a neighborhood bar with a touch of class. Very good food. In house prepared, organic spices and ingredients with lots of flavor and variety.If you're not into keeping things real or your nose is too far up in the air to appreciate good food and drink then this is not the place for you. The lamb chops are phenomenal. The dining area seating could be a little more comfortable and the space could use some acoustic panels to tone down the noise when the the place is packed with happy patrons. Great beer and wine selection. Try the margarita. Love the pairing suggestions and daily menu specials. Daily Happy Hour 3-6."}
{"text":"OK, They got me! I have been in the place three days in a row and each time it has gotten better. The thing I love and won't forget is the owners brought in Dogfish IPA just because I asked, customer service doesn't get better than that. Now my favorite hang out. I had the turkey ruben for lunch and it was really good and the service was top notch. Great patio and now my favorite beer!!"}
{"text":"Taphouse Kitchen was amazing. From the minute we walked in we were greeted by the hostess who was smiling and very attentive. The hostess explained the concept and the restaurant's menu. Immediately after we were greeted by our server who was very knowledgeable about the food, beer, and wine. Even though the beer and wine selection was HUGE! The server had the answer and even had great suggestions to pair our food with a great beer or wine. The entire staff was friendly and attentive. I would go back everyday if I could. The scallops, wings, and sliders were all amazing. I can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu. The dessert was absolutely amazing. Everything is made in house and all produce and meet is from local farms. This place is an absolute gem. I would recommend this place to anyone looking to try a new restaurant with a great staff, great drink selection, and amazing food. DEFINITELY TRY THIS PLACE. You will want to go back, I promise."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great. Jen behind the bar is always a big plus. Managers are the best, just the perfect place to go after work, relax and have a nice ice cold beer at the bar..... and don't forget to try their breakfast,  everything I have tried has blown my mind but I crave the French Toast creme brule almost daily."}
{"text":"Food is really good and priced just right.  Service was pretty fast and they stayed on top of everything. Worth checking out for sure."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour with a friend.. our first visit and we were not disappointed! Sat at the bar and our bartender Michele made us the BEST sangrias ever!!! I had the red and my friend had the white... nom nom nom!!!  Who needs beer??!!"}
{"text":"The food is original and we'll prepared. The crab cakes are excellent and not full of filler. Ambiance is relaxed casual. Good place to hang with friends and family."}
{"text":"This place has decent food and good beer. Service is lacking big time, and the Philly cheesesteak special today was blah for $15 I would expect way more. Our server never smiled or asked how the food was. Never checked on us once. For the priciness of this place ideally expect more. Not sure how many more chances I will give this place."}
{"text":"I'm skewing the perfect record but I'm sorry. I haven't been this disappointed in a dining experience in a very long time. My family and I sat for almost 10 minutes while we waited for our meal. The waiter finally stopped by, asked if we had ordered any drinks, but realized we didn't have menus, and left without taking any drink orders. 10 minutes later he's back with menus. Still no drink orders. 15 or so minutes later he finally takes our drink order. So needless to say, the service was poor. When we  finally did order, we were famished.   My husband had their signature burger which he described as forgettable.  My father had a grilled cheese with mushrooms, and Chicken Chili. He loved the chili describing it as \"filling and hearty\"   My mother had the fish fry and she loved it.  I had the chicken and dumplings and I was quite disappointed. It lacked depth, and flavor. My husband took a bite and said the Military MREs has more flavor.   The service was poor, the table of drunk girls got unwavering attention. So perhaps, they cater to a drinking crowd.   Best part of the evening? Watching a Scottsdale mom pull an Olive out of her martini and feed it to her infant. DRUNK BABY ALERT lol   My take away, come for the booze. Ignore the \"gourmet\" menu."}
{"text":"Nice open seating environment with an outdoor seating option,  but not much table space outdoors for groups of 6 or more.   The fish fry was tasty, but the Parmesan Yukon potatoes were greasier and more well done than I expected."}
{"text":"Had the burger which was good but not great.  It was pretty salty and the meat patty was kind of on the skinny side.  They weren't too busy and my server was nice but it 100 degrees outside and I had to ask for a refill on water."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is fun and interesting, the food (turkey reuben) was excellent, and the service was really good and polite.  The gluten free chocolate cake was delicious.  I think the non-sandwich items on the menu are a little pricey, but other than that, great new place.  I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Loved the open patio. It was really amazing food! Loved the lamb \"pops\"!!! And wine and makers mark on tap...can I  just say \"heck yes!\" And then top it off with the gluten free brownie dessert that my friend had was unbelievable:) Can't wait to try it again!"}
{"text":"We have been here a number of times and really like it. We have never had a bad meal. They have rotating taps, amazing Bloody Mary bar, and High West Rye on tap! Favorite food is the charcuterie, eggs benedict, and New York strip. They actually cook it rare. We will be back."}
{"text":"This place is great.  Don't miss out on this restaurant.  We were a party of 5 aaannnd everyone enjoyed their meal.  I got the pike fish fry... awesome.  I'll def be back"}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to eat Saturday afternoon, and after driving around decided we would go to Houstons.  It was packed so we decided not to wait.  We say a sign for tap house kitchen and decided to try it. What a pleasant surprise!  It was bright & open inside with lots of TVs.  Of course my husband was happy.  We asked our waitress what was good and she said their hamburgers were her favorite. They are our favorite now!  What a great hamburger!   Cooked just the way I ordered it.  It was very large, and very juicy.  The bun was really good also.  The fries were delicious.  Our     waitress was delightful. We are so happy we found this little place."}
{"text":"We came for dinner which conveniently was during happy hour. Beers were $2 off which reduced the price to $5. My wife enjoyed a burger though I helped with the waffle shaped sweet potato fries. I had a small steak and  small wedge which was good. By local standards the $49 for dinner and drinks before tip was fair.  We had an attentive server.   This is a good place to eat"}
{"text":"Great tasting beer. Great burgers. Friendly staff. Clean restrooms. Plenty of parking. User friendly."}
{"text":"Start to finish, this meal was fantastic. We enjoyed sitting in the patio and we were especially happy with the prices. We went during happy hour.   The gluten free options rival any full gluten foods! The taste and texture were very good. The sauce had a strong tomato flavor with just a light sweet taste.  Our service was great and the portions were perfect."}
{"text":"We were here visiting from Cali. & looked to Yelp for a yummy lunch. Glad we spotted this gem. We arrived and were seated with no problem. The service and food was good. I had the fancy grilled cheese with waffle cut sweet potato fries. Our waitress recommended a side of their home made honey mustard. Yum. Purfect lunch spot with good drinks, food, and service. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Newly updated menu (phenomenal turkey burger), LOWER prices, stellar service, and still the best kids menu in town (non-fried sides..., thank you!).  Why would you not become a regular here?  Seriously..., why?"}
{"text":"Happy hour goes until 6 and also includes 2 appetizer options (each $10). I ordered the fish fry and wasn't too happy with it. There was more fried than fish and it cost $20 for something that should've cost around $12. Didn't have much taste, but the spices on the fries were good. All of their entrees are pricey for the type of food it is, but maybe it's to balance the high rent costs? We also tried the lump crab appetizer (enough food for an entree) and it was well received. Dad thought the lasagna was too acidic, but I liked it and the arugula topping. Service was good."}
{"text":"Cool place to grab brunch and a drink. Atmosphere is great and the bartender is so friendly. I plan on making it a place I visit frequently when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This is a cool place - nice patio seating (and it's the perfect time of year in Scottsdale to eat outside).  Attractive layout.  Good and varied menu (and several Gluten-free items - suddenly important because our foreign exchange daughter has Celiac's).  I ordered the TapHouse Signature Burger - big burger, manchego cheese, bacon, all the fixings - really great burger.  Mac-n-Cheese side was also very nice.  Definitely need to come back!"}
{"text":"Where to start? Me and my BF eat out every night (terrible, i know) so we get bored easily. Tap House was just down the street from home so we figured we would try it!  Not only is the service AMAZING, from the person who took our order over the phone, to the server, SO friendly and more than willing to make recommendations and answer any questions! the food is AMAZING!!! My bf continues to order the Turkey Rueben wight he fingerling potatoes (SO BOMB) and i am obsessed with the Cashew Chicken Salad Sandwich. Would def recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!  Guess we should've expected this for Scottsdale, so part of it is our fault for not researching this place more for how much of a rip off this place is. Still, $8 for 4 normal sized soggy wings, plus it says honey chipotle sauce.. It's not, it's just regular wing sauce. Then ok yea $4 for a side salad, but it was just about half a hand full of lettuce and two tomatoes, pretty weak. Then $13 for a burger?! Nothing special at all, the server said they're really big. Nope. Normal size burgers, just over priced. Oh yea all sides are a la carte. So the $13 is just for the burger. LAME!!! But hey other than that things were good. Just wish we saved our money and went to chilis for the same price/quality and WAY more food. Oh well, smell ya later THK!!! LOL"}
{"text":"I'd give this place negative stars if I could...   I called two weeks ago to make a reservation for Friday the 3rd for a surprise party of 15. I was told \"no problem\" gave all my information and was told to call back a week after to confirm. I called to confirm and was told, \"yes we have you down\". A week before my reservation, the \"manager\" calls and tells me they're sorry, but they're cancelling my reservation for Sunday the 5th because they're closed. I correct him and say, my reservation is for the 3rd, not the 5th. He tells me, either way there's nothing they can do - they don't have any space because of the Phoenix Open and the person who took my reservation wasn't authorized to do so. I am floored - why was this person not aware that they couldn't make these reservations. Also, I called almost a month ago to make this reservation especially because of the open.  I was told - TWICE - that my reservation was confirmed and now have to find a new location a week beforehand for a large party. It's absurd to me that this manager/owner barely apologized and offered no assistance in fitting us in because of their mistake. They have no concept of customer service, which is extremely disappointing."}
{"text":"Pre-made charcuterie boards. Unable (i.e., unwilling) to make a vegetarian board. Mind you, they made me a vegetarian charcuterie board during a previous visit. This time it was, \"Idk if we can do that...I don't think we can...I'll ask...\" even after I said I'd had it that way before. After checking with whoever, the bartender came back and said yeah, it's not possible for them to make a vegetarian charcuterie board and they have NEVER done that. We were like, last time we did have it made vegetarian and he said \"No, we've definitely never done that.\" So basically we were accused of lying.   Aside from the charcuterie board nonsense the bartender was not personable at all. When we had questions, he kept giving one-word answers and then hurrying away before we could order. Taphouse as a great beer selection, good happy hour prices, and excellent hummus, but with the rude service and the refusal to accommodate, I won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"I tried this place with a couple of friends after getting a direct mail flyer. It is in the neighborhood and it sounded great.  I was NOT disappointed. The beer selection on tap is expansive, and the food is divine. We did all appetizers because everything looked amazing.  The ambiance was so inviting. You want to sit down, chat, and stay awhile.  If you are in the area, I recommend it.  We did, however, come at an off time. I have no idea what it is like during the busy times."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. We weren't happy with the salad, but the steak was good. After having just a couple bites of the salad, we didn't like the dressing at all, so we waited for our server to check on us and politely let her know. She said she'd take the salad off the bill and just charge for the chicken that came with it. (We just had a couple bites and mixed it in with the salad). We told her this and she gave a very unprofessional eye-roll of doubt. Usually this is when they offer to give you something else, or a manager comes to check on you to see if they can do anything, but no, not here.  For the rest of the time we were ignored. The manager would occasionally pass by, glance at our table and shake his head and mutter something. The servers were all grouped up chatting while ignoring us.  Overall, a very frustrating experience and a terribly unprofessional staff. We were very polite to all of them and didn't deserve that terrible service."}
{"text":"The food is really good, but for a Monday night I waited 45 min for the jerk chicken salad. The salad was $15 and was suppose to have avocados, but my salad had none, and was on the skimpy side."}
{"text":"I was with a group of about 12 people on Saturday and we had some time to kill before going to a wedding. Since this place had just recently opened I thought it would be good to try out. We walked in and tried to get the hostess to seat us. She looked extremely overwhelmed by us coming in, by the way it was not crowded, and said she would have to get her manager to seat us. While this was happening some of us decided to go to the restroom and they were disgusting! It looked like no one had cleaned them in several days, they smelled terrible and the trash was overflowing! After coming out of the restroom we found out that manager was refusing to seat our group and that they would not be able to serve us. I have never been treated to such poor service ever! The restaurant had more than enough room for us and they would not give us any reason why they could not accommodate our group. With all the other fantastic restaurants in the area I can't imagine this place will be open very long based on the way they treat their patrons."}
{"text":"I've only been here once but had a great experience. Trendy but casual atmosphere with cute decor. Appears very clean as well. Our waiter Alan was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu and the manager came by to make sure we were enjoying our food. I had the TapHouse burger and sweet potato waffle fries, both great. I'll definitely be back to try more!"}
{"text":"Very pleasantly surprised!   The Food Exceeded my expectations.  I had the Pasta Primavera with chicken and my husband had the burger. We shared both and they were very well made.  And the food came out in a timely manner. Our waiter was very attentive. We had the brownie and house made ice cream. We were very happy we changed our plans of where we were going to go and came here."}
{"text":"I've been to Tap House with my family twice - both for brunch and dinner. Both times, the experience and the food have been wonderful! Their craft beer and wine selections are excellent. Their brunch menu is amazing - I would especially recommend the Hash, it was wonderful. I would also recommend their burger and fries - it's on point."}
{"text":"Hamburger was good. Decent selection of beers. Probably need more if it has tap house in the name. Prices are a little high for food."}
{"text":"It was our first time visiting this restaurant. We went on a Sunday afternoon right after a rain storm. Sat outside on a covered patio. I had some wine and my fiancé had a beer flight. We also split some wings and sliders. Delicious food, great service and awesome atmosphere. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I wish I was writing about my fabulous lunch but sadly I didn't get to try this place out. It's a shame the staff here is so inhospitable. I really wanted to try this place and it smelled so good but I walked in and there was no greeting and I waited at the host stand for 5 plus minutes while 2 staff members saw me made eye contact and walked away. One gal walked right by me dropped a check at a table and kept walking to the back so I left. It wasn't busy but even if it was a simple hello we'll be right with you is expected It's not a privilege for me to patronize your restaurant."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a drink after brunch at Bink's to check the place out.  It had a great, lively vibe to it and they have an extensive drink list.  The food menu looked good, but pretty run of the mill bar food.  Definitely seems like a popular place, so make a reservation, if you can."}
{"text":"We came here randomly after spotting it from the road. Just looking for a beer and appetizer. Perfect find! Our sliders were cooked perfect medium rare, and the meat & cheese plate was good too! They have a large tap selection which was fun. Overall, a very clean, modern interior. Would definitely recommend and come back!"}
{"text":"Really nice place to eat and drink.  Had a mule to drink with tequila and it was very well done.  Burgers were awesome, seasoned well, nice bun and fresh ingredients.   Salads  were really good and a good selection  of beer.  A good place for dinner."}
{"text":"Waaaaay overpriced. Since when do you go to a gastropub and just about everything comes a la carte? It's not a fancy steakhouse where that's expected. It's a glorified bar. The service was fine, but I wasn't the least bit impressed with the food. I wasn't really feeling anything on the menu so I ordered the sliders, thinking they'd be safe. Wrong. First impression when they came out was, where is the top bun? Next thought was, where's the beef? The meat was smaller than your average grocery store frozen meatball. Three of them could've fit on one bun. And there was a really weird taste. They actually took them off the bill, which I appreciated but it still put a dent in my wallet. Fries were ok. Wife had short ribs and garlic mashed potatoes--she liked them--all I could taste was salt. They had a decent beer list but unfortunately we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Great food and service, wonderful menu! Options for kids, vegetarians and meat eaters"}
{"text":"Good food and excellent service.  Nice patio seating.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Great little culinary gem tucked back behind Houston's off of Scottsdale and McDonald. They've got mouth-watering cuisine and butter cake that is absolutely to die for!  Super friendly staff and speedy service. Only ding...it's a little pricy for what it is. But then again, you get what you pay for, right? Good thing they've got that butter cake ;-)"}
{"text":"2 stars for service. Waited almost 15-20 minutes after our 1st flight was done. Waters were empty. Not very attentive.  4 stars for beer selection. Enjoyed the Harvest and Arizona Highway flights.   Would've had a meal here but put off by service. Haven't decided if I'll come back."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times so far and I love it! They have a great beer selection, I'm in love with the burger (the fish fry is great as well), and the ambiance/decor is very relaxing."}
{"text":"Super disappointed.  Struggled between 1-2 stars -  then realized I would give a 2 only based on we didn't have to wait, which later I decided after eating I understood why.  So breakdown:  1 - couldn't sit where we wanted to even though the entire place was open.  2 - our server was extremely rude and not familiar with any of the dishes, recommendations, or menu.   3 - manager delivered food and his interactions was more than rude, \"watch it this is hot,\" after he reached over my 77 year old mother.   4 - we cleared our own dirty dishes by moving them to the next table because everyone passed them up.  Now, on to the food:  1 - eggs Benedict rated a 4/5  2 - fish and chips a 3/5  3 - Mac and cheese with shrimp 1/5  4 - lamb chops .5 out of 5! Over cooked!!!  5 - chicken dumplings - PRE-MADE and definitely microwaved!!!  Gordon Ramsey would have a fit.   First time there.  Will not come back.    If I had to describe in 3 words:  1 - FOCUS IS WRONG is on location and capture of organic growth not quality  2 - STAFF IS RUDE   3 - CUSTOMER SERVICE IS BELOW 1 star   Oh; and you pay for something that is less than its worth.    There's lots of restaurants that are more than one star.  Seek it out, this place is a PASS!!!!"}
{"text":"I have had brunch here twice this year and both times the food was excellent.  I have had the turkey burger, chicken tacos, short rib tacos.  All Good.  Kid's menu is great as well and expansive than just 3 of the same items like most places."}
{"text":"The TapHouse Kitchen is a casual restaurant located in Hilton Village in Scottsdale. They serve Pub Style Foods and Global American Casual. Craft beers, Wine and Whiskies are on Tap. the dining is bright during the day from natural sunlight that comes from windows in the ceiling.  We got seated and it took fifteen - twenty minutes for someone to wait on us...we were about to leave. We eventually ordered and waited about thirty minutes for our platters.  I ordered the Beer Battered Walleye Plate. The fish was very hot so I try the other things first. The Cole Slaw seemed fresh made but was very plain and sort of bland....I guess that's ok...They gave me an extra generous portion of fries...maybe enough for three people. The fries seemed like hand cut and had fluffy interiors and were seasoned nice and did have a great taste but were thin cut and were almost cold when I received them. Now to the fish......The first bite was tasty but the batter wasn't crisp......Second bite the batter seemed soggy......Third bite the batter was very soggy......all the batter was soggy now. I don't know if the fries steamed the batter on the fish or if the oil just kept coming out of the fish and made the batter soggy.....  My husband tried the TapHouse Signature Burger. It came out almost medium rare like he asked for. I thought it looked good.....I asked him how it was and said very dry....I didn't believe him at first because it looked pretty good.....Then I asked if I could feel the patty.....IT WAS VERY DENCE and DRY. Either they had a cook on that SQUISHED all the juice out while it was cooking or the beef was too lean and was packed too tight. I thought the side of macaroni and cheese was good but under seasoned.  The food all sounds good that they offer but we experienced poor execution that brought things down."}
{"text":"Must have been a very off night for this place... Walked in and told them it was our first time in- we live in the neighborhood and were looking forward to giving this place a try- super sarcastic hostess says, \"yeah we are pretty awesome\". Umm ok. So we asked for table of 5 plus a high chair, took them about 10 minutes to figure out they couldn't seat us for at least an hour, hostess was so rude- said they don't normally seat parties of more than 4 (what!?). Walked out front to find three empty 4-top tables, walked back in to hostess and asked if they could push two together and she told me that's not their policy and she would have to ask a manager- even more attitude from her now- I let her know I would like to speak to the manager at this point. He turns out to be even less help than her. We explained we lived up the street etc, he seems like he could care less. Just a side note here- we are a clean cut married couple- dressed casual but nice- late twenties with a beautiful little blondie baby and we literally live two seconds from here. So bummed at how lame this place turned out to be. Won't be back. Last thing- we decided to eat at ha humble pie instead, turned out to be happy hour still and we were seated right away either amazing service as usual and great food."}
{"text":"Was feeling adventurous and just moved into the area do my boyfriend and I decided to give it a try. The have my favorite beer on tap (kona longboard) among tons of others. Amazing happy hour deals. Our waitress was Brianne and she was fantastic. Quick and courteous service with some friendly conversation but she wasnt overbearing. Every dish we got was phenominal from the grilled lamp pops to the french fries to the ny strip with the bacon maple glaze (tears were brought to my eyes as i ate it) and my boyfriends burger was so juicy which is hard to do when you order it medium well. Will definately be coming back soon."}
{"text":"Busy but surprisingly good all around, food, drinks and service. Happy Hour specials were outstanding to include a delicious crab cake for $9. Full of crab, moist yet crispy outer crust and nicely accented with light scallion and aioli. As the name suggests, even wines were available on tap, choices were excellent $8 per glass even for happy hour though.  We tried the clam chowder, highly recommended! Not too thick with rich flavor and lightly herbed. Even contained two fresh clams steamed open but still contained lots of chopped clams and bacon. The walleye fish fry was good, wish the fish pieces were bigger though. Contained four pieces but were a bit thin with a heavier doughy crust than preferred...the fish itself was fresh and cooked perfectly. My wife had the sliders which initially arrived a little overcooked and dry but was immediately recognized by the server and replaced with fresh sliders which were much more appetizing.   Overall, we truly enjoyed our first visit to this establishment and look forward to returning. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"OMG...where to start?  We chose the sliders and crab cake off the happy hour menu. The sliders are magical topped with quail eggs and hollandaise sauce and the crab cake was almost too beautiful to eat. For the main course we shared the THK salad with shrimp and lamb pops. The lamb pops were insane!  We ate them so quickly we had to order another one. The chef is an absolute genius...do not come here expecting bar food...this was an incredible surprise to have food in a casual atmosphere that was equal to a five star restaurant. The staff was friendly and provided excellent service. If I lived in Scottsdale, I would be here frequently!  This is a must for anyone wanting something fresh & new!  Our waitress Ti was the very best...which added to our experience!"}
{"text":"Love this place! We had the Bloody Mary bar, creme brûlée French toast plus the turkey Eggs Benedict. Do NOT miss Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"I was pretty happy with my first visit to Taphouse Kitchen, which came highly recommended by my mom and I liked that it's a local Scottsdale pub.  We went during an NFL game, so I was impressed that we were able to snag one of the few remaining tables.    They have a great beer and wine selection, and we all enjoyed our meals.  I had the turkey burger, and my boyfriend had the fish n' chips.  We both left with happy tummies.  The service was decent - not over the top friendly, but they were attentive and the food came out quickly."}
{"text":"Great place!  We order the chicken and dumplings Absolutely delicious! Fresh ingredients, vegetables are cooked perfectly and the chicken broth/sauce is the best ever! So flavorful!  Probably our 10th dinner here.  Quality is better than ever.  Fun place, good choice of music playing and 5 flatscreen tv's for sport fans  Alix was our server and she did a wonderful job! She was very attentive."}
{"text":"Hungry a bit later in the evening, the choices I had around me were a salad place, a pizza place or the Taphouse Kitchen - and I was in the mood for a good burger.  The staff was very nice, friendly and made sure I felt welcomed and comfortable.  I had the house burger and a Moscow Mule (their house specialty) - it did not disappoint!  Burger was done correctly (juicy and buttery) with toppings and fries at the right crispness. I can see why their Moscow Mule is a house specialty, too. Made correctly with a sweetness that did not overtake the drink. A good experience overall."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and we went to this restaurant with a friend who recommended it.  Food was good, not memorable, but solid pub grub that left you satisfied.  Service was good.  What doesn't leave me satisfied is that my credit card was charged for $3 more than I signed for I find out later.  They did not respond to an email questioning it.  $3 isn't exactly break the bank territory but an explanation would have been nice.  Don't provide an email on your web site if you are not going to use it."}
{"text":"My father and I wanted to go to somewhere new that we hadn't been before. Some kind of sports bar with good food and good beer. We came upon the Taphouse kitchen, and first thing we encountered was a Bloody Mary bar with a plethora if ingredients for the actual drink and your olives. They had beef jerky (interesting), traditional olives, barbecue meat, and my favorite song was spam (or at least it looked like it).   After browsing the drinks, we saw they had about 20 different beers on draft from throughout the country. I was missing San Diego, so I got a Ballast Point Sculpin. What was really cool was the variety of wines and they also had Makers Mark and Jameson on tap!   On the menu I was ready to crush, so I was pleased to see a simple but excellent menu, the chicken dumplings looked good but I had to go for the burger. Another sweet thing was that they had beer and wine pairings for each menu item which really helped. Anyways, the burger came out and oh man, amazing! Bacon came in the form of bits, it didn't have onion it had shallot (good change up), and the patty was perfectly done and delicious. My dad got the turkey burger and he doesn't always have the biggest appetite but he demolished it all, I was proud!!   Next time I will get the Bloody Mary bar for sure, enjoy your time there!"}
{"text":"Terrible. Slow Service. Food overcooked. Had to fight to get bill. Server offered to give discount for future but won't go back."}
{"text":"My husband wanted to try this place, so we did.  We got there just as they opened, so there was no trouble getting a seat.  Our drink order was taken, and my soda and his beer were delivered quickly.  Lunch order taken, and the wait began.  I had the Chicken and dumplings, my husband the TapHouse burger.  The chicken and dumplings were so-so, the burger dry.  Not worth the $14 & $13 respectively.  Not once did our waitress ask if my husband wanted another beer, another server did.  By this time several other diners had come in, and received their entrees much faster than we did.  Still waiting to see our server,but she was too busy hanging out at the kitchen window.  It took a long time to get our tab, and yet another server took our tab to cash out.   To sum up, poor service, mediocre food at best, and $7 for a 12 oz beer.  Save yourself the trouble, don't go here. Even the manager was ambivalent when we told him our issues."}
{"text":"Had the lamb pops, chicken wings,  fried fish, burger and bread pudding dessert. All were awesome. Really like this place, great food and cold beer. Had a dark and stormy, it was OK, blue water grill makes the best."}
{"text":"We visited the TapHouse twice in a weeks period - in the area on vacation. The first visit prompted the second ... While I was a bit disappointed we couldn't have some of the happy hour apps as part of a regular appetizer (fig/proscutto flatbread please!), we got over it and had the drunken shrimp ... very good, would definitely recommend. They do a nice job with kids meals - good selection and price. While we were here, we got word that the burgers are among the best (this, after filling up on shrimp)...so we decided to return at a later date. Came back second time and sat outside on their patio - definitely best seats in the house. Great ambiance. Ordered burger, definitely good - also homemade chips were quite tasty. Waiter was gracious enough to bring me samples of wine when it was clear I had analysis paralysis to help me make a selection. We had several visits to our table from the owner, very nice and friendly, making sure our visit was satisfactory. Its a bit on the pricey side, but definitely enjoyed the experience and would return again to try even more of the menu items."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service. Relaxing atmosphere and a great place to unwind!"}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour even on Saturday! Cold beers on tap, and appetizers,  try the sliders & shrimp Mac."}
{"text":"Came through here in between my conference sessions and I was really impressive with the amount of beer they have on tap.  The food is pretty good and maybe a little pricey, but it is worth it.  I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a good bite to eat."}
{"text":"OMG!!! Amazing food! Matt was awesome, really explained the history of restaurant. Even though they are till young, man are they making a big footprint! The cheese fondue was definitely the best in the valley, oh yeah and they have 20 beers on tap, oh and 5 wines on tap. I would recommend detached house kitchen to anybody whether you're going out for a fancy date night we're just kicking it with the boys."}
{"text":"Was up in the area for a work conference and decided to do a mini Scottsdale brew pub tour. It was the promise of beer cheese fondue that lured me to this spot for lunch. I figured lunch wouldn't kill me.  Was greeted by the floor manager and he confirmed my Open Table reservation. It wasn't busy at all for early lunch on a weekday but filled up very quick. You can be casual or business and feel at ease here.   Many local brew options, along with some specialties and surprises. Make sure to check out the tap and the brew pairings they offer. Chalkboard menus let you know they are on top of it.   Went with the cuban sandwich with fries that yes i dipped in my beer cheese fondue appetizer. Delish! High class bar food at your service. The manager checked in and chatted it up, along with our wonderful waiter.   Check this place out to see a little Scottsdale casual brew pub action.  Faves: beer cheese fondue, atmosphere."}
{"text":"Awesome house burger. Just the right seasonings and toppings. Their selection of beer is worthy of multiple tastings! Our server, Meghan, was spot on!"}
{"text":"Stopped here tonight on the way to do some shopping, and I kind of expected to not like it much due to the small vegetarian selection. However, I actually liked it! I liked the decor, the wine bottle lighting was pretty awesome, and a neat bar area. Not a whole lot of options, and the entrees are pretty pricey. But I ended up getting some sides/an appetizer and sharing! I tried a little bit of the veggie pasta and it was pretty good. The mac n cheese was yummy but not my favorite. Hummus was tasty, and a big portion! Also waffle fries are awesome..the fact that they have sweet potato waffle fries definitely made me happy!  Good service too, nice and quick, helped me figure out what vegetarian stuff I could get. I'd like to come back again to try out lunch next time."}
{"text":"You wouldn't think brunch at this place, but you'd be so wrong. Great breakfast with inventive dishes including a unique spin on eggs Benedict and a great pastrami hash. Don't miss the Bloody Mary bar."}
{"text":"Top notch!  So many new places skip training and are grossly understaffed, offering up a miserable experience when first opening.  That is not the case here at all.  TapHouse is clearly run by pros.  Not only is the staff friendly and knowledgeable, but they're everywhere and they work together offering up phenomenal service.  The menu is great, they have a really solid beer selection and a great patio.  This comes after just having lunch there.   I'm really looking forward to dinner and following that up with 5 stars."}
{"text":"Very good service, atmosphere very appropriate for the \"tap house\" style, and I can't wait until the weather cools off to enjoy the patio area. I did think everything was a little overpriced - $14 for a Turkey Reuben (actually, it's a Rachel) that doesn't come with any sides at all. I ordered a side of the sauteed kale, which is more arugula than kale...I'm not even sure there was ANY kale in it. Nice beer and wine selection, but also overpriced. Agree that it would be nice if Happy Hour went til 7."}
{"text":"Appetizers: hummus-too watery & salty and vinegary. The pita is yummy.  2 stars  Beer cheese: bread is soaked in butter. Cheese tastes not very fondue-y. 2.5 stars  Short rib: crazy salty, 1 star  Chicken & dumplings: tasty and fresh BUT chicken is suuuuper dry, like i ate around it. 2.5 stars.   Service: good   This was 110$ dinner than felt like a 40$ Dinner at best. Although we were vocal about our food problems, and my husband didnt eat his 30$ shortrib, no effort was made to assuage our disappointment, no offer of desert, nada.   Won't be back"}
{"text":"This is a great new place that I started going to because it opened up near my office. They have a great beer selection and I love the atmosphere here.   After my last visit, I left my sunglasses and called the next day to ask if they were there. They said they weren't sure, but took my name down and said they'd call me if they saw them. A day later their manager Kevin called me and said he had found them. I asked him to hold onto them until came by next time and he said he'd mail them to me! I live in California and was pleased to see my sunglasses arrive 2 days later.   I'll be back for the beer and the service!"}
{"text":"This place is very nice from the moment you walk in.  Comfortable rustic decor and friendly staff.  Outdoor patio and rollup windows are great for nice days.  I had the shrimp mac and cheese appetizer which was good.  They have a great craft beer selection.  My favorite is Odell's IPA which I was glad to see that they carried.  I appreciate their happy hours prices but wish they ran until 7 PM."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Recommended from a guy in the pool..the Chipotle mayo was phenomenal! The wings were steep for 4 wings bit hey they were fresh and delicious! The burger was awesome!"}
{"text":"Had a beer flight with 4 amazing beers!! Love the ambiance of this place and can't wait to come back for the Jameson on tap!!"}
{"text":"The food and service continue to be excellent, with creative and delicious specials daily."}
{"text":"We come here every Sunday. The staff is so friendly and accommodating... We love the \"grilled cheese\" breakfast sandwich and the French toast.... The cheese fondue is phenomenal and the burgers hit the spot. The main word that comes to mind for this establishment is \"consistent.\" It's always amazing. The manager/ owner recognizes us and constantly greets us. The patio is air conditioned and so comfortable to sit there. We can't say enough good things about this place. Brunch, lunch, dinner we have never had a bad experience and we've been going weekly for a year!"}
{"text":"Came here last night for my birthday dinner.  Had reservations for two at 7:30, though they really weren't needed.  I am typically weary of places that are not too busy.  So when I saw they weren't too busy I had already low expectations.  The hostess definitely didn't help change my perception.  After sitting down for a few minutes we were greeted by a wide smiled waitress named Marina.  We got tasted the beers before ordering them.  Great thing is the list is actually quite large, about 20 on tap and a dozen more bottled.  They also have wine and whiskey on tap too.  They have 2-4 rotating taps.  So definitely good spot to try out some new beers.  We ordered the chicken and dumplings, short rib and a side of mac and cheese.  The short rib and chicken and dumplings were tasty and the serving was a really good size.  The chicken dumplings were interesting, they had some nice vegetables in there adding some texture and color.  The mac and cheese was under seasoned and the rue of the mac and cheese was super runny.  Also tried the key lime pie and the homemade vanilla ice cream.  The key lime pie was tasty, not overly sweet and had nice lime flavor.  The vanilla ice cream was really creamy, pretty good.  Our waitress was nice enough to give me a candle on the key lime pie, and even comped one of the desserts.  One of the better places I have had in Scottsdale.  Good food, good service."}
{"text":"Met a friend for a Saturday lunch at Taphouse. I really liked the interior - very open with a covered patio and the inside is huge with a bright but not glaring industrial feel. Service was very attentive - we were seated immediately and our server came right over to ask if we wanted water while we looked at the drink menu. We ordered drinks then decided to split the beer cheese fondue - very tasty and when we ran out of bread, more was brought to us. My friend ordered the cuban sandwich, and I ordered the Taphouse burger. Hands-down, the best burger I've had in over a year. My friend said her cuban was amazing. Both sandwiches were huge and we ended up taking half of each home (I'm sure it wasn't because we stuffed ourselves on the fondue). I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place was great. A little on the pricey side but I like that all the meat is from local farms. The burger had an amazing char flavor and was a perfect medium rare. The kids Alfredo had the flavor of an extra cheese in the sauce and it was perfect. And the chicken and dumplings couldn't have been more perfect. The chicken was a tad on the dry side but it was more than made up for by the perfect l perfectly done aldente veggies and what seemed to be home made gnocchi.  The sauce description scared me off initially with the description of a mustard sauce but it did not taste strongly of mustard and was a just right pairing for the dish. Wish I lived here I would make this a regular pit stop!"}
{"text":"I was excited to check out TapHouse Kitchen over the weekend for brunch with a group... We were celebrating a birthday, and the birthday girl chose THK because of their happening and kid-friendly atmosphere, brunch cocktail specials including a \"make-your-own-Bloody-Mary bar,\" and the great food she'd experienced there before.  Note: Brunch is served at THK on Saturdays and Sundays from 9am - 3pm.  Birthday girl made an 11am reservation for the group.  We walked in and were pleasantly surprised at first by the energy in the place.  There were a couple of people at the hostess stand that gave us a nonchalant \"hello\" (not a warm welcome), before we looked up to see that some of our group was already seated.  We headed over there and seated ourselves...  The waitress was sweet and confirmed with me that she did not need to write down our orders, despite our group size of 11 people.  \"You're sure you don't need to write it down?\" I asked.  She nodded.  I trusted her and ordered a bagel and lox for myself and a side of bacon, a side of berries, and a side of french fries for my two young toddlers to share.  I also requested an ice water for myself, which I had to ask for several times before receiving...   When the food came for our group, I started to think how impressed I was that everything came out alright.  And then I looked to my right and realized that birthday girl's grilled cheese didn't come at all.  We all sat there while our food got cold for a good 20 minutes.  (I'm not exaggerating).  The waitress said it was coming right out, but it didn't.  About 25 minutes later, she brought out an order of French Toast.  (Not what birthday girl had ordered).  My husband said to keep the French Toast at the table for everyone to share -- and we ended up paying for that too.  It was another 10 minutes before the grilled cheese arrived, and without even an \"I'm sorry for the delay\" from the manager that delivered it.   I had to leave to take one of my kids home, but I left feeling like we wasted our money at this brunch... and that was before I learned that we were double charged for the sides of fries and berries.  The bill showed two sides of each when we only ordered one.  (We did order a second side of bacon that luckily came out quickly).  There are so many dining options in the Valley that after this experience, I would consider before returning.  All of that said, if you find yourself at THK for brunch, the winning entrees were the French Toast and the Grilled Cheese.  I hope you have a better experience than we did."}
{"text":"I discovered this restaurant several weeks ago, and was looking forward to giving it a try.  I was sorely disappointed after we were seated. Their beer selection is impressive, featuring four local breweries and several other microbrews from across the USA. Their prices for a pint of Odell's IPA, I found to be exorbitant. $7 for a small pint. I was surprised.  After slow service and a burger that needed some improvement, the manager asked my wife how things were. She gave an honest answer, and didn't get any kind of response other than \"that's harsh\". Between lackluster service that was bordering on being ignored, high beer prices and food that was so-so the experience wasn't worth it. I won't be returning and I suggest you don't either. Reluctantly, I have rated this place 2 stars.."}
{"text":"Great spot to watch sports and hang out with friends.  Besides a nice beer selection they also have different spirits and wine on tap.  That's right...on tap....."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this amazing place! When they say a scratch kitchen this is it! Some of the best hummus around and the shrimp Mac-n-cheese was the bomb well next the the turkey burger that I now crave for everyday! Michele behind the bar is very sweet and attentive. This is a must try spot!!!"}
{"text":"Don't let the name fool you. This is not your typical taproom that only serves greasy mediocre food. Excellent menu, beer selection and service."}
{"text":"Beautiful and clean restaurant/ bar and the staff and ownership are also exceptionally friendly.  Stopped in after a couple of softball games with a buddy and felt a little underdressed but was welcomed warmly and treated great by the staff.  That alone would be enough for me to go back, but decided to try the sliders and OMG, it was the best thing I have ever eaten!  If you enjoy a great atmosphere, great service and delicious food, then don't go anywhere else but TapHouse Kitchen."}
{"text":"A friend of mine had raved about it on his FB page so I thought I would stop in for lunch.    The menu looked great and I had a hard time making a decision but opted for the Ham & Brie Sandwich with a side of fruit.  The sandwich was tasty good but I thought they skimped on the brie portion which was the whole reason I ordered it.  I should have said something but wasn't in the mood to hassle with it.  Really like the warm atmosphere and the indoor/outdoor bar design is super cool.  Service was prompt and friendly.  I am looking forward to going back and exploring the menu."}
{"text":"On the road and went to TapHouse for Happy Hour, very good place that I'd recommend."}
{"text":"Tap house was introduced to me by a close friend and I've been addicted ever since. Delicious menu items - from Mac and cheese to a just a salad it's all amazing( I've had every item). Today Megan is my bartender and she is quite lovely- but all the other girls are just as good! Bar has everything you could ask for and a ton of beers on tap! Absolutely my go to!"}
{"text":"I don't know if I had \"yelper\" on my forehead or what...but I've never had such great service as a casual establishment?!!  Kudos to our server Jake, he made sure we'll be back.   Stopped by with a girl friend for some happy hour and appetizers.  The flat breads are creative and delicious.  The malbec on tap is very good and awesome for that price point.  Don't miss the mac and cheese amazingness!  Cute patio, good ambiance.    It's about time a fun place like this came to \"central\" Scottsdale!  We'll be back.    The only negative I can say is it's irritating when happy hour ends at 6pm.... I have faith that you'll change that...please?  :)"}
{"text":"Definitely love this place. The beers and wines on tap are awesome! I've had the burger several times and think it's among the best around. Insanely cool titos Bloody Mary bar on the weekends. Sit at the bar with Michelle, she's the best!"}
{"text":"We thought we had the right combination with the steak and blue cheese lettuce wedge after a great game of golf, but the breakfast French toast and the eggs Benedict were not especially cheap but sooo good."}
{"text":"Unfortunately with a couple exceptions, the food choices are a bit on the mediocre and over stated.  The waiters are super nice tho. But the bartender/ owner was edgy and maybe suffering from too little business.  Too bad.   I won't bring my friends there again.  There are many better places nearby!! Adios Tap House.  Muy MALo att"}
{"text":"I reviewed this place before but we couldn't stay away. We go about once a week and the food is always delicious and the selection of drinks are great! Check it out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Tap house Kitchen had an awesome Salmon salad and I ate most of it. We ate at the patio which had plenty of shade so it didn't feel too hot. Service wasn't bad either. For two salmon salads and an ice tea, our bill was around $35 which is slightly above average to me. I would still come back."}
{"text":"Enjoyed some beer and a quick bite to eat. Food was good and beer selection was ok. Really nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Service was outstanding. The food was very nice as well. The tomato soup was very tasty.We ate the Taphouse Signature Burger and the Fish dinner. They were both really well prepared and tasted fantastic. The amber ale was delicious as well. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"As far as gastropubs, value, service and quality go this place got it right on all levels.   Wings: phenomenal. Equal to Todd English wings in Vegas.  Large, made to order, juicy, on a bed of bleu, garnished with cucumber shavings which take the place of boring celery sticks. On HH menu these are only  $6!  Cheese fondue: Great! Not amazing because it is on the liquid side of cheese and is more reminiscent of cheese soup...but the crusty parmesan topped bread is perfect for dunking. Did have to add copious amounts of salt despite the kick from the harissa oil.  Kids: They are welcome here! There is a comprehensive kids menu and for $8 you can select a course, side and drink.  Drinks: Comprehensive wine and beer menu with some inventive cocktails as well, but my fave was the frozen margarita, priced at $7 during HH and packing such a delicious punch that I had to beg my hubby to drive us home. Have you ever had a frozen marg at ztejas? Hands down the best and just as amazing here.  Bill came to $41 for two alcoholic beverages, three appetizers, and one kid's combo meal. Fantastic value!  Wish we had room for dessert as I spied cheesecake and creme brulee french toast!"}
{"text":"Good cocktails...bartender accommodated my request for item off menu and did a good job. Ordered butchers platter, very good...spicy mustard is spicy! Friend ordered fondu, not our thing...kinda funny and bland. Folks seemed to love though as neighbors at the bar ordered too. Neighbors also said great things about crab cakes."}
{"text":"We were excited to try this place out.. cute inside and decor, however, wayyyy overpriced.  Probably would not go back due to menu prices."}
{"text":"Their steaks are phenomenal  I also enjoyed the asparagus to compliment   Service at the bar is great Firestone double jack IPA on draft is always a plus  A little pricey but you're in Scottsdale"}
{"text":"Everything we had was amazing! Best clam chowder I have had in my life. I asked them to take there tap house burger and make there version of a bbq burger... And they nailed it!! So good."}
{"text":"We went for an early dinner. We enjoyed the lamb poppers and crab cake with a simple salad of excellent greens. Cost was very affordable for the area. Great craft beer selection. This will be a reliable good meal for us on future trips to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Service is excellent! Beer & Wine on Tap, very good! I ordered wings and those were mighty tasty. I also tried a bite of the burger and I plan to order it upon my return. I am a fan for this place. They got my vote!"}
{"text":"My party was all from out of town and we travel a lot for business so while none of us are foodies we are a bit spoiled when it comes to restaurants. So I took to the Yelp community to find a place in Scottsdale for my crew of 6 to eat...the Tap House Kitchen was highly rated. Last night we were looking for a low key option with hardy food, beer and a patio since the weather was superb!  While the service was great all evening and the atmosphere was relaxing, we were all underwhelmed by the food- steak, burgers, and the short rib special. Everything lacked flavor but we were hungry so we ate most of it anyway.  I gave it 3 stars to challenge the \"chef\" to kick up the flavor....that would make the THK top notch and worthy of 5 stars!"}
{"text":"My friend and I , sat at the bar and had two tap beers each . 30 dollars without tip ! The people who eat here must be very very rich ."}
{"text":"We were debating between 1 & 2 stars. The beer was very good but the server was snarky and the service went down hill from there.  The steak salad I ordered with the steak cooked medium came 'rare', my husbands chicken and dumplings was more like soup so he asked for some bread. The actually charged us $2.50 for 3 pieces of stale bread. We had planned to go to a different restaurant that had great food and excellent service but as you can probably guess it was packed along with a couple others. So we decided to try this place as it had some open tables, actually it was near empty. Now we know why.  We will not return."}
{"text":"Great casual atmosphere with great service and food. We had the burger salad and salmon. The burger was perfectly cooked and it was a great alternative to a burger with no bun. The salmon had great flavor and the perfect portion."}
{"text":"A nice casual atmosphere! Great service and excellent food. The cheese fondue with garlic bread starter was very good. The signature burger was perfectly done. My friend had the steak and wedge salad and cleaned the plate!"}
{"text":"I first went to the Taphouse Kitchen to.check out what I heard to be an amazing nosh and mingle place.  It was everything I expected, warm and inviting. Really kind staff and everything is made from scratch. I had the delicious wings! A great blend of spices and a touch of sweet.  It took me two weeks to return....nearly going to go to a nearby restaurant,  we luckily went in for the amazing brunch. The Brioche french toast is the most amazing thing in the world.. my mouth waters...thinking about it.. the eggs benedict was also spectacular, roasted turkey on sourdough with a crazy delicious guacamole  with bits of bacon mixed in... omggg wow..  Its deadly good.   You get the idea! Its worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Very interesting menus. Drink and foodwise. Nice atmosphere and friendly attentive staff. Nice spot to enjoy a nice lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"WOW HAPPY 4th of JULY what a great new find in Scottsdale, Bill the manager has been a chef in Zurich and brings that great skill to us at the TapHouse in his unique one of a kind Europe meets the West creations. Everything is fresh and made to order from the cocktails to the deserts, all local grown and home made, DELICIOUS! can't say enough, I'll be back soon! A must go to for anyone visiting or for a local hang out spot any time! Friendly atmosphere great drinks, appetizers and menu...."}
{"text":"Went there as a party of three for a quick lunch.  Sat at the bar area--half outside.  We had great service from a lovely female bartender/server.  All three of us had the special grilled chicken, fresh mozzarella sandwich.  It was wonderful.   The server was very attentive.  We will be back as there were many other great looking things on the menu we would be interested in trying."}
{"text":"I had to send my drink back twice as the bartender could not make a martini.  I ordered a salad and the lettuce was wilted and old.  It was not a good experience and the service was just ok -- I would not recommend unless you want a beer and a burger those looked good.  The atmosphere is amazing"}
{"text":"Shared a turkey Reuben,slaw & shrimp Mac-n-cheese.all delicious.  Savannah, our server, was pleasant and attentive as were the other staff.  Our seats at a high top on the patio enhanced our dining experience. A coz interior and ample bar is also appealing."}
{"text":"Nice neighborhood casual spot with wide variety and good drink selection, as well as a great happy hour. Prices are between about 12-20 for entrees, less for salads and starters. Wide ranging beer, wine and spirits selection.  Weekend brunch that goes until 2 or 3 with a make your own bloody mary bar with premium ingredients! Really like this place...only reason I can't give five stars yet is the service has been a little slow and disinterested during my visits. Once they get that taken care of I'd happily give it five stars."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is fantastic, and the staff are great. I really like the selection and that they make a point of highlighting their local drinks. The food was also unique and delicious. However, based on this site, I was expecting the average price of an entree to be less than $25. Granted, I don't know what their happy hour prices are (I've heard they're good)."}
{"text":"Wow....of all the restaurants in the area, this one is a must!  Lamb kabob app, crab cake, hummus plate, shrimp mac-n-cheese were ALL epic!  Burgers are great and IF (it's a big if) you have any space left in your stomach, and even if you dont, order the Butter Cake!  The most delicious cake all five in our party has ever had!"}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying I do believe this place has the best burger in town. The rest of the menu is so so. Nothing to write home about if you know what I mean."}
{"text":"Great design and great service, wife and I split the chicken salad sandwich and it was excellent, fries are great too"}
{"text":"Went there for happy hour and their prices were very reasonable. The food was excellent and the ambience was very nice."}
{"text":"We came by on a Sunday afternoon. The service was slow and not especially friendly. Patio is fantastic. The turkey Reuben was not very good. Fries came out incorrectly, which they fixed, but they weren't notable otherwise. Food pricing doesn't match flavor or quality. To their credit, they have some great beers on tap, too bad it takes a while to receive them, even when the place is sparsely occupied.   Next time, I'll direct my friends to Humble Pie."}
{"text":"We went for happy hour. We had crab cakes which were good. Wings only 4 which seemed a little short and sliders that were horrible. First had hair in them. Sent them back. Then got bloody sliders that made the bun mushy. Hollandaise didn't work with beef. We asked to hold the quail egg? Don't know where they were going with that. Beer selection was good and wait staff were nice."}
{"text":"I've been twice and had totally opposite experiences. The first time was fantastic! Great drinks, service, and the apps and entrees were wonderful. The cheeseburger was one of the best I've ever had.... And I've tried a lot of burgers around town. Even the desserts we ordered were huge and delicious. The second time I went, last week, was bizarre. The mussels app was bland, and the brie and apple flatbread was the most pathetic thing to have ever left a professional kitchen. It looked like something a 4 year old would create for themselves on \"pizza night.\" I took one bite and left the rest on the plate. The waiter said that was the most popular flatbread... WHAT?! We also got the sliders that came with a bearnaise sauce. All I could taste in it was lemon! Ick. I'll try again, because the atmosphere is great and it's a really beautiful place, but I'm hoping for more."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a very relaxing dinner First time at the TapHouse Immediately greeted and sat in a fun environment Many choices and suggested pairings  Our server was Alex... she brought us some drinks and then being first time goers had some questions which she was very knowledgeable about the product . Her suggestions didn't disappoint . I had the turkey Reuben that wasn't on the menu but spotted up on the wall and my wife had the jerk chicken salad We shared some awesome sweet potato waffle fries . Alex made several trips to ask us how the food is and brought us fresh drinks We thanked Alex for her outstanding service We certainly will go back ! Great job Alex  ! The nice part of the TapHouse is the music is not loud and you can talk without shouting ."}
{"text":"We just had a wonderful dinner at the Tap House. I live 5 minutes from here and have been wanting to check this place out. Got there at 5:30 in time for happy hours (7days a week) ordered the cheese fondue with the most delicious garlic bread ever and wings. That fondue is beyond delicious and my husband raved about the wings. Burger and fish and chips for the main course. Once again fabulous. Service was A++++ I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I've sampled a few things from their menu a few times. The cheeseboard is kind of skimpy. The crab cake is pretty good. The lamb pops are way way way too salty. They have a pretty nice wine and beer menu so that's at least one plus. Another plus is their shrimp Mac-n-cheese. YummmmmEeeee!   Love the decor. It doesn't feel like you're in a strip mall type place. The service is fast, the staff is friendly. The chef has some pretty awesome creations that I still want to try so even though some things weren't to my liking, I'll still plan on sampling more from the menu.   Side Note: Okay okay. I know I don't normally comment on the look of the staff at eateries but this place? Whoooo Weeeeee!! The bartenders (both male and female) are so cute! And the waitstaff (only male on the nights I've been ... Yay for me) is really handsome."}
{"text":"Having the best beer flight and charcuterie (which means sliced meats in French) ever! Awesome service! Very knowledgeable staff friendly locals. Highly recommend! My first time in AZ and I am loving this place."}
{"text":"Great staff. Great food. Great beers. What more do you need for a restaurant? Go. Now. Your tummy will thank you. Please note, they can not mail postcards for you. However this is common in AZ so it shouldn't detour you. I got the turkey burger and it was perfect. My son got the hot dog and that bun was yummy too."}
{"text":"Fantastic food!!! Great location and our server Natalia was super friendly, knowledgable and quick. This will be one of our regular spots."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.  We've been going there since they opened a few years back and have consistently been satisfied with the service, the food and the atmosphere.  While I love going here for a drink after work a bite for lunch or relaxed dinner, brunch is where it's at.  100% the best brunch in Scottsdale.  Their eggs Benedict are my go to while my gf likes the croc monsier.    Neither of us like blood mary's but their blood mary bar is always well stocked (i steal the hot sauce for my eggs).  Their mimosas are perfect and they have a huge selection of whiskey and wine.  Basically, a great way to spend a Sunday brunch... or really any time.  Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"As others have noted, service is very poor at brunch time. This includes management, who disappears just like the servers do.  Hostesses are useless and have no idea how to interact with guests. This place won't last."}
{"text":"My wife and I happened by this location by chance, and decided we would give it a shot.  So, if you like places with huge menu selection, and a wide diversity of items, you will be disappointed with Taphouse Kitchen.  The selection of draft beers will make up for it a little ;)  What they DO have on the menu, is all top notch. We started with the Jalepeno and Cheese tater Tots. These were NOT what I was expecting. You get 5 HUGE tots (about the size of giant marshmallow from the grocery store) They are very tasty, and come with three different dipping sauces.  For the main course, my wife got the Rock Shrimp Pasta, and I got the Chicken and Dumplings. Her shrimp pasta was pretty good, and the cream sauce was very flavorful. presentation was very nice. I was confused when I got my dinner.  When I think of chicken and dumplings, only one thing comes to mind. Chicken, dumplings, and veggies, in a creamy yummy sauce. Yeah, no. Not here! The chicken was tender, the dumplings were house made, and the carrots, roasted corn, and pea pods were obviously fresh and cooked up to order. What threw me was the broth. It was not your usual cream based sauce. It was, in fact, a stock-style broth, that included a \"wined-down\" version of their special house made mustard sauce( which is super yummy, and comes with the giant tots).  My son ( 20 months old) had the penne pasta w/ marinara sauce. That came with a bowl of fresh fruit( strawberries, raspberries, and blackberries)  He ate everything! ( I helped with the berries! )  For desert, we had the butter cake, which is served with a scoop of their house made pistachio ice cream. Again..delish!  Only 2 reasons I gave 4 stars. The menu is limited, which also turns out to make everything else better, and I think some of the shrimp still had a little sand in them.  Regardless, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Well what can I say the food was amazing we got the Greenlet muscles and andouille sausage I personally don't really like seafood but my boyfriend loved it I did try it I didn't joy of sausage though. We also got the thk wings I really liked those they have a little kick to it so if you like spicy food you would definitely like this.  We also the Arizona raised prime New York strip OMG it was sooooo good its a must to order I loved it and will order that again!  As far as the drinks I got the taphouse mule if you like ginger this is the drink for you I did it with vodka. And I also ordered the southern sour that was good also :)   I definitely will be going back soon"}
{"text":"New place & great food & atmosphere!  Happy hour daily. We had really tasty soup, flatbread & more.  Everything is fresh & made in-house. Nice patio area as well. Be sure to check it out!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at this restaurant twice. Both the food and the service are exceptional. The salmon salad with watercress is fantastic. The chocolate brownie was so thick it could sink a battleship. The waiter was so attentive I thought he was the owner but he is just very professional. Very nice comfortable ambiance."}
{"text":"1015 pm  lights go on I guess they want us to leave wtf Friday night. I'm glad everybody finished dinner on our party"}
{"text":"Pricey fancy food, but delicious. Took my mom here when she was in town to try it out. Wifey was included.  I'm writing this months after we went here and I honestly can't remember what we ate. I do remember everything being \"high quality\" ingredients and lots of those \"fancy flavors\" you get at nice restuarants.   I'm a pizza and burger kinda guy, but I like to feel sophisticated every once in a while. This spot hit it for sure. Everyone loved their meal and we'll be back."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times in the past several month as it's in my neighborhood. My favorite parts are the bar and the patio. Fav appetizer are the lamb pops and waffle fries. I have had the wings a few times but wouldn't recommend. The other day I tried the hummus for the first time and it was delicious. Hubby always gets a burger and he enjoys that. Oh yeah, the salmon is delicious as well. I can't really comment on drinks I usually have wine. They have plenty to choose from. I think they even have whiskey on tap. I will continue to go it's easy to access in terms of parking and never too crowded but always a good crowd. It's a little pricey for the menu but not too bad. I will continue to go. It's solid."}
{"text":"This is a great new place in the Valley. I have had the Jerk Chicken Salad and the Chicken and Dumplings so far and both are fantastic! I will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Great new casual restaurant - I live in the neighborhood and have been here a handful of times. Nice to find a restaurant that supports local farms/breweries.   I would be here a lot more if their happy hour ran past 6:00 pm but it's nice that they offer it on weekends. My favorite menu item so far is the Sherry Berry Salad - tip: order this with salmon! You get a good sized salmon filet (wild, organic salmon), that is almost as big as the one you can order and an entrée. And it goes perfectly with the salad.   On the happy hour menu, my favorite starter (so far) is the shrimp mac-n-cheese. My least favorite is the flatbread - it's a crispy lavosch with toppings. Not bad but not what I was expecting.   Service is usually pretty good, I was there once when it was very slow but most of the servers seem to be pretty attentive. When the weather is nice, definitely recommend a table on the patio.   I can definitely see myself becoming a regular!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Monday night and the place was poppin!  I sat at the bar viewing their craft brew menu on the way.  Seems like they have 2 special beers on a weekly basis, but you have to ask the server what kind.  Unfortunately, they're generally IPAs and I'm not a fan.  I shot for an Amber Ale while my friend ordered a mix drink.    For our food I went for the Chicken & Dumplings and my friend the Jerk Chicken Salad.  The Chicken & Dumplings was okay in my books.  It came with chicken, balls of dumpling, carrots, and sugar snap peas.  The peas gave it some crunch, but I wanted more texture; some shaved fried tortilla shells might have done the job plus it needed some spiced up kick.  I thought the dish overall would have made a perfect chicken pot pie stuffing.  My friends jerk chicken was spicy in my books; but she didn't care for the extra char on the chicken; plus it was dry.  Though the citrus dressing and avocado salad was an excellent combination.    In the end, the place had a cool vibe and probably a place to chill for some craft brews and appetizer bites.  The service was really on top of things, but overall the food was okay at best. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Excellent brunch.  Great selection and the best Bloody Mary bar.  Our server Braydon was exceptional.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Love this place! First visit here today. Unique decor, Great patio area. Service was great and best of all was the awesome food! Today's special was a mango salmon salad w/carrots, cashews & cucumbers with a fritter & fried eggplant with a soy peanut drizzle. My husband had a cashew chicken & grape salad sandwich. SO good! We're here a few more days. Going to go back for sure! May even try happy hour!"}
{"text":"I'm really sad that my group had the experience (or non-experience, actually), that we did with this restaurant. I had been a loyal customer for a long time, since Taphouse was the hidden gem that you loved to take new people to. My fiancé and I would go all the time, and always bring friends. We are having a very large wedding nearby later this month and were going to direct our out of town guests to eat there throughout the weekend, but we will no longer be recommending this restaurant to anyone, nor will we be supporting it in any way.   My friend planned a surprise dinner for me and a party of about 15. She made reservations at Taphouse a month in advance, knowing that it was the weekend of the Phoenix Open. She called a week later to confirm (as they requested she do). Fast forward to ONE WEEK before the event, and she gets a call from the owner. He says the woman who took down her reservation was not authorized to do so, and it would be cancelled because of the Open. No apology, no offer to rebook another night, NOTHING. One week before and she has to find another restaurant to accommodate a big party on a Friday night. Luckily Hula's in old town was the perfect setting and offered great service. So much to being loyal to a restaurant and then being thrown to the curb when something better comes along. Sorry buddy, but you just lost the business of 15+ regulars, plus anyone we would have recommended there. We will not be back."}
{"text":"VERY NOISY... Went on a Friday evening during Barrett Jackson week. Place was crowded but got seated relatively fast. We sat inside as that was first available table.  Food was good, service attentive, good portion size. Hamburger & turkey burger was excellent. Pricing a bit high for this type of restaurant. Lots of TV's if that's your thing.  Place was overly noisy so much so that there was no way to have any semblance of a conversation in our party of 4. (-1*).  I guess I am a slow eater or had the largest portion. Our friends plates were cleared very quickly and then I looked down to find my plate was gone as well... well before I was done eating!!! (-1*) Overall I would recommend this place if you don't mind the poor acoustics. May be better if you are sitting outside."}
{"text":"To be quiet honest, we came here out of desperation. My son really wanted to go to Houston's but they only take walk in reservations for table of 5 or more. Found out we would have a 3 hour wait. Not acceptable. So I look on Yelp to find another option out there. Found three highly rated restaurants right by each other. Iny meany might mo and we chose TapHouse. Got a table right away.   So you walk in and it's an indoor/outdoor bar with TVs at the bar but more of a modern looking bar restaurant. Very casual environment. The waitress was very friendly and very accommodating as we waited for the rest of our party.   We started out with the jumbo lump crab cake. It's stacked high with shoestring potatoes. It was jumbo. Lots of crab and very good. Love the shoestring potatoes with it. The softness of the crab cake with the crunchiness of the shoestring was just right with a small dab of tartar sauce. Hit the spot.   I ordered the special of the night Cioppino. It was really good. It came with about 4 nice huge jumbo shrimp and about 4-5 muscles. Very very good. Would recommend it if they have it on the menu that night. I would say it's pretty filling too.   My son ordered the short ribs and he thought they were pretty good too. Daughter had the local garden pasta with chicken. Didn't hear any complaints from here either.   We ended our night with a key lime pie which was very good. My son really liked the gram cracker crust. So good.   I was a little Leary about this place cause it was just before 6 and it was almost empty but by the time we finished, this place was packed and loud. Really good crowd. It's a restaurant bar so pretty loud and relaxing. The waitress was very good. Friendly and knew the menu and even knew the special too. They filled our water cups and even topped off my coffee too.   So we actually had a really good time and enjoyed ourselves. Great service. Very good food and loved the ambiance. Very low keyed and relaxing. No one trying to push you out the door.   I would have no problem coming back here. Enjoy we sure did."}
{"text":"This was a tough review, with the name Taphouse you would expect beers to play a huge part of this business and they do but way too many mediocre offerings such as Stella, Kona and Widmer but a number of good local favorites such as SanTan, Papago and Four Peaks help make up for it.  Biggest gripe was with the prices, yes it is Scottsdale but the beer costs them the same as other places and $7 a pint is too much to charge for where others charge $5 or $6 for the same beer.  Food prices also high by about 25% over what I would consider a fair price but we were celebrating so what the heck The Coconut Joe braised short ribs were pretty damn good and the service was good. Wish this place had better prices so we could go back more often."}
{"text":"We went there in February and the service was really slow ( took four requests to get water), but the food was good. We went again before an event in late March. We ordered beers and food allowing plenty of time to eat. We were halfway through our second round and getting worried about the food.  When we flagged down our server and she checked on it, she said our order had never gone in.  By then, it was too late to put in another order and we had to leave for our event with no dinner.  All we got from the server was \"I'm sorry\".  No effort to comp all or part of our drinks.  Nothing.  This was not a matter of the place being busy.  There were about a half dozen tables occupied and three servers working.  Just a matter of not paying attention to the customer.  After the event, I called the restaurant and talked to a woman who claimed to be the manager.  She apologized, said she would look into it and took my name an number saying she would get back to me.  She never did.  I realize that mistakes happen, but this could have been handled better and made right.  It wasn't, and we won't be back."}
{"text":"We went here last Sunday to watch the World Cup and we really enjoyed the atmosphere. I ordered the meat and cheese plate which is one of my fav things to order when I'm out. It was pretty delicious and filling. Also on the happy hour menu, I think it was Only about $6, but I'm not positive. They had a Bloody Mary bar but unfortunately it closes at three pm so I missed that. One of my friends ordered  the fish and chips and said it was really good but way expensive for how much they give you. It was like $28 for only like two pieces of fish. We also got the pepperoni flatbread that was on special that day. It was ok but nothing to write home about.   Service was a little slow but everyone was mostly just hanging out watching the game which might be why. Overall good atmosphere And I would definitely like to come back and sit out on the patio once it cools down."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and loved the atmosphere and food so much we decided to come back for brunch! Food was beautiful and tasted even better!"}
{"text":"Service was poor.  There was hardly anyone in the restaurant and after my meal was served no one checked on me.  I would pass this place up if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Food and service both were outstanding! A fantastic evening with friends. We shared the Charcuterie Starter plate and each of us had a Margarita (It was celebrate Tequila Day!). Smooth, go down easy Margaritas. Then we each ordered the Short Rib Special. Guests at the table next to us were looking like they might trade their delicious looking burgers in for the Short Ribs - they looked that good when they arrived! The meat was literally fall apart tender and mouth-watering tasty - oh my. And then, as if we hadn't had enough to put us into a food coma, we ordered desserts - Bread Pudding and a Key Lime Tart!  Short of licking the plates clean, we consumed every single sweet bite. It was a meal that none of us will soon forget.   One final note: Our server, Timothy, was on top of his game. He had several large tables and he never seemed to miss a beat with any of them. Service was outstanding and very professional. And he had the cutest smile . . . he made us feel right at home at the Tap House."}
{"text":"Split the shrimp mac-n-cheese and tap house sliders with my buddy. Great value during happy hour and even more delicious than I expected. Lots of flavor, not very heavy, and the sauce and quail egg on the sliders leave your mouth watering for more. Same with the mac-n-cheese. The shrimp did not over power the flavor."}
{"text":"Love the fact that they have beer, wine, & whiskey on tap.  Unique happy hour food choices add to the mix. Also a small but nice patio. I like the way they have shutters to block the sun but allow a breeze through."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great menu options, they prepare the food well, quick service and the food tastes pleasantly as expected!  Who can ask for more! :)"}
{"text":"While visiting Scottsdale for our nephew's wedding we tried TapHouse for dinner.  We were so impressed & knew they had sports on the TVs, we went back for lunch the next day.  We're NASCAR fans, so they turned 1 TV on the race, just for us.  Food, service, drinks, the best.  We'll be riding the Harleys out for lunch!"}
{"text":"Amazing brunch, great atmosphere and fantastic service. Will be returning for more amazing food."}
{"text":"Some food amazing/some food ok, bad customer service. Liked the sliders a lot. The fondue was so runny it was more like a broth, definitely would not recommend it.   We went here for a happy hour and filled two giant tables (more than 15 of us). Still the service was spotty and rude. When the time came to get the bill, the waiter told our table (8 of us) that he couldn't split the bill. Fine. But we still had credit cards. When we started asking him to put different amounts on a total of 4 cards, he got all huffy and said \"Fine! I'll just split the checks.\" Then he brought the checks and they were all messed up and when we asked to have them corrected he again got huffy. Finally after we paid we were walking out and my husband heard our server and his manager bad mouthing us. When he confronted them, they said \"usually in a large group like that somebody just pays for everyone.\" Really?!? We are not business travelers expensing things to our company. We are regular people with budgets. It's not like we didn't want to pay or tip, that's what we were trying to do! It was a negative experience and I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday and started out with a dirty glass. The server recommended the burgers and 4 people in our party decided to try them. 3 of them came out red through out when they ordered them medium and one person said slightly pink in the middle but it was red. She was going to try and eat the burger and ate part of half of the burger but had to complain. The server brought her half of burger back and it looked disgusting they just threw her half burger backwards on the bun and brought her plate back with her scraps back to her. When you pay $14 for a burger you should have some higher expectations. The burger when cut obviously when put back on the grill looked like a dry lump of coal. The server said he would have the manager come and talk to us but obviously our party of 10 was not important enough for the manager. Will never go back there again!! Too many great places in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This place has a great draft beer selection. They even have Jack on tap. The food is good. Our to go dish is the chicken and dumplings. It's comfort food but it's nice and light. They also have a nice spread for bloody mary."}
{"text":"Last night was our second visit to the TapHouse Kitchen.  The fish and chips (walleye pike) were great both visits.  The quail egg sliders are also super.  Last night we had one of the several flat breads offered.  It was terrible.  It was served cold and tasted like cardboard. I guess we should have said something at the time. On both occasions the noise level was horrendous.  During the first visit the place was fairly full, last night we were early and there were only several tables occupied in the bar area with a dozen or so people where we were seated.  You could not have a normal conversation. It is definitely not a place to have a relaxing drink and meal."}
{"text":"Went in at 830 and they close at 9pm. They host and the waiter made it clear severs times that the kitchen closed in 30 minutes. The staff was rude and unprofessional."}
{"text":"Our first visit here was on a Saturday during happy hour, we loved the brushed metallic accents complimenting the remodeled Repair shop interior! First off the prosciutto and lamb pops, succulent and simple appetizers. Then the Beer flight paired with the signature sliders, refreshing and filling combination! Fun to experiment with these flavors in a casual setting.  We recommend you become a regular here! - 4.75 Stars!"}
{"text":"I went in last weekend for family and friends and was completely surprised! We were blown away with the atmosphere and decor we even sat down. We grabbed chairs at the bar, ordered a custom flight (choose your own 4 beer tasters), and sliders. Papago's Coconut Joe stout was my favorite. The sliders came with a quail egg and Bearnaise sauce. These are now something we get every time. The salmon was also awesome-- not your average salmon dish. And of course dessert was perfect. We have a gluten allergy and to our surprise, we were able to order a gluten free brownie with ice cream. Holy COW!! The most rich and chewy brownie. And to make it even better, the sweet baker sprinkles in her own toffee for a little crunch! We will be back again, and again."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is nice, but I didn't care for the food.  Even though it was extremely slow on a Saturday afternoon with barely anyone there, I sat at the bar and had to get the bartender's attention after sitting there for 15 minutes waiting for my check.  After the food was delivered, she didn't bother to come back and check on me - then she left and another guy took over, and he never spoke a word to me the whole time I was there until I asked for my check.   Taphouse sliders - flavorless and greasy.  Shrimp mac & cheese - rich, but more like cheese soup with shrimp and noodles"}
{"text":"Great local restaurant with amazing french fries!! A must if you are looking for a new place to eat in Central Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Excellent food, service and ambiance. I was so impressed with how well my little kids were treated, I wasn't expecting it to be so family friendly but it was. The burger was fab. The Mac and cheese was delish, the fish and chips were awesome, the total on the ticket was totally doable since we luckily hit happy hour on a Sunday and our server helped us order accordingly. Servers who actually try and help the guests save money wins my heart and loyalty every time. Also, thanks for being so kind and accommodating to my young children! I will come back often and refer this place to everyone I can."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with my wife and a friend last Sunday and ordered Minestrone; still no crackers or roll or bread served with it.  My server offered to bring me some crackers, promptly forgot, or a $2.50 slice of bread to accompany the soup. I am glad to report that the Minestrone was milder and very Italian rather than a Southwest, peppery rendition of Minestrone. I count that as a win! Returning for lunch tomorrow and hope to get crackers this time. Baby steps, LOL!"}
{"text":"Great, Friendly service. Excellent drink selections and quality food. The wings and fish fry are the call."}
{"text":"Modern Gastropub with Great Food  TapHouse serves standard, modern American food with excellent execution. We ordered the Lamb lollipops, Burger Salad, and Burger with Chips. The Burger Salad was a good healthier alternative to the  Burger, which had a great smoky flavor. The chips were made in house and very well done. The lamb lollipops are amazing! Seriously, they were one of my favorite dishes I've had in Scottsdale. Our waiter was friendly and attentive. I'll be back for the lamb!"}
{"text":"I specifically went here to partake in the bloody Mary bar with its outstanding 200 items to add to the bloody Mary. I should have taken a pic because there was no more then 20 items on the table and several of the bowls were empty with nothing in them.   Don't waste your time like I did on this bloody Mary bar. VERY DISAPPOINTED"}
{"text":"8:30 p.m. on a weeknight. We tried another restaurant across the street first. But, they were closed for a private party.  Yelp lead us here.  The place was all but empty. We were greeted politely and seated immediately. The server was prompt and beverages were brought immediately.  Chicken and dumplings and their Tap House burger were our choices. The burger was cooked perfectly to order. The bun dwarfed the rest of the ingredients. For the price, it seemed a bit on the small side. Tap House chips were just OK. The chicken was overcooked, dry and stringy. And the dumplings tasted more like globs of dough.  Service was first rate, though.  I think this might be best for people who want to enjoy some brews, maybe watch sports on their TVs and yuk it up with a group of friends all while being much less concerned about the food itself."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I try a new spot each month since our husbands are not into trying new places. Since a new Taphouse is currently being built in my neighborhood we decided to try it out in Scottsdale. When we arrived we were seated and they had the front open so it was chilly inside as if you were on the patio. My friend was freezing so she got a hot tea. The server brought it out with 3 bags, the little pot of hot water and a tall clear glass with a handle. Not a mug. She chose one of the teabags and put it in the pot to steep. The next time the server walked by she scooped up the other 2 teabags. She tasted it and scrunched up her nose. She would have tried another flavor but she had no other choice. The other teabags had been removed. As we do at other places we try we get 2 items and split it. We chose the Taphouse salad and the cashew chicken salad sandwich with a side of Taphouse chips. We asked for the salad first. When it came it out the presentation was very unappealing to look at. Greens that looked more like weeds. Not a spring mix. And any item that was supposed to be in the salad was non existent except for a thin 6 inch slice of cucumber draped across the top. The citrus that was supposed to be in it was a few grapefruit bits the size of my pinky nail. Maybe 3 bits in each. We crunched our noses again. I tasted mine and decided not to eat it. It was disappointing. The cashew chicken salad sandwich was ok except I did not see or taste the crunch from the cashews. The only thing I tasted was the chicken and grapes. The khallah bread was a good idea to use as a bun but it fell apart pretty quickly. The Taphouse chips were good. Nice and crunchy- not soggy. I think the one thing that really turned us off was that they charged us $2 for each meal we split. It's not like we bought one meal and split that. I would expect to be charged. But we bought 2 full entrees. The split charge was posted on the menu but we figured it was if we had only ordered ONE meal between the two of us. We could have very easily split it ourselves and asked for another plate. Plus the place was empty. Just us and one other table on a Saturday. I hope that it was a server mistake. Last nose crunch- there were many flies in the restaurant. Very annoying to be eating and swatting at the same time.  All in all I think they are hoping people will drink and not notice how meh the food is. I'm not going to return or recommend this place even once it arrives in our neighborhood. I try to be factual and non emotional in my reviews. I will not go into the fact that the server was snarky. We wanted lunch but were given the brunch menu. Even after asking for the lunch menu she never brought it. $50 for lunch with no alcohol. I think not. Three stars is generous."}
{"text":"The Sweet and Sour salad was delicious, as were the sliders and hummus.  Great atmosphere and a diverse and creative menu. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Really liked the Mac and cheese with shrimp appetizer and chicken and dumplings.  Great service as well."}
{"text":"Overall the food was great. I had the chicken and dumplings. It was an interesting twist on a class but it was very tasty and delicious.  I really liked the sauce and the dumplings. I had the makers mark Manhattan and it was very good. It was nice and strong, as a drink should be.  My only issue was I waiting for a long time before a server came to my table. Once he did the other server came up as well so it was awkward.  But overall I would try the place again"}
{"text":"Great place and excellent food. Staff were nice and very attentive...would recommend anyone to try it out. You will not be disappointed..."}
{"text":"Had happy hour snacks for dinner tonight. The cheese fondue was like cheese soup. Odd that the chef prefers it this way. Will ask for extra cheese next time. Hailey our waitress was great!"}
{"text":"I met a friend here for dinner since she was staying at the Hilton next door. We started off with the cheddar and jalapeno tater tots. These are not just tater tots, my friends - these are mammoth sized cylinders of goodness that come with 3 sauces. Probably, some of the best tots in the land! Intrigued by the concept of a \"Burger\" salad I went for that. Delicious perfectly cooked salty, juicy burger topped with yummy grilled onions along side a romaine salad liberally coated with thousand island dressing  and avocado slices.  Service was fabulous. I can't wait to take my husband - the restaurant offers many beers on tap (hence the name taphouse) and they also do flights."}
{"text":"Walked in off the street from shopping just needing quick bite of anything for nourishment. Two adults, 2 kids (yet this is a pub/bar) but sampled happy hour menu of Fondue Share (had a soupy consistency - not sure what was Fondue about it but the bread that came with it was excellent. Same thing with Mac and Cheese Bowl with Shrimp; sauce was good but 'soupy', not really sure it even had cheese in it :). Wings, who can go wrong with - they were good but we got sauce on side. Hailey was server and had great friendly personality. In and out in 30 min and on to another happy hour spot; total bill came ot $25.91 which was reasonable for 4 people - so while not great food, it served its need."}
{"text":"Bland, bland and more bland. The chicken and dumplings, turkey meatballs and kids Mac & cheese needed a whole lot more flavor! I think the chef was afraid to season anything. Way overpriced for food that was subpar at best. The food also took forever to get to us (more than 30 minutes).  There was only a couple of tables which had customers. On top of that,  they need to improve on the service.....when we left all three waitresses were sitting at a booth texting on their phones. This place needs to step up their game or have Gordon Ramsey come in and straighten  them out!!  Wow!"}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. Had a party of 11 and all the food was great from the salads, to the burgers and wings. Additionally, they have a fantastic drink selection. We will definitely come back again. Plus, I am coconut/coffee stout happy."}
{"text":"My family and I went into this fine establishment last night. We were greeted right away and seated within minutes. We had a fantastic dinner. My husband got the chicken cajon pasta. Absolutely delish. I had  the tap house burger. It was perfect. My sons grilled cheese was wonderful. Great beers on tap as well. The customer service was superb. Our waiter was so nice and very helpful with recommendations. We'll be going back."}
{"text":"Fun decor and atmosphere!! Casual ambiance with familiar foods done in a sophisticated way. I just have two words for you, butter cake. To this day, the best dessert I have ever tasted. It was such a great place to celebrate my birthday and I can't wait to go back! Especially for that butter cake..."}
{"text":"Seriously GREAT SERVICE. I'm amazed! Such a friendly staff. I ordered food to go and they had it ready for me at the bar when I got there. The bartender was busy, but took a minute to talk to me and get me settled up. Both managers approached me and asked if there was anything else they could get me before I left. Really clean environment, friendly staff, great food - what else could you ask for?! I have worked in the restaurant industry for a long time, so I tend to be really picky anywhere I go. I actually thought I had misplaced my credit card so when I went back in... Both managers were helping me look for it (turned out it's in my other pocket and I'm an airhead). Anyways,  the hostess was smiley, attentive and opened the door for me when I was leaving. I definitely recommend getting friends together and eating here."}
{"text":"Great ambiance here. I love the fireplace! This place even had gluten free beer. The service was good and the food was delicious. I really enjoyed their flourless chocolate cake. I highly recommend this spot."}
{"text":"Our new favorite neighborhood place!  Great ambience, yummy food and great drink options. A little pricey for \"bar food,\" but fish 'n chips are awesome. Key lime pie is to die for....save some room!"}
{"text":"Any establishment that has Devils Ale on tap is a fan of mine. This place is pretty new, very clean and cool decor for a gastropub. I ordered a burger with a side of sautéed kale. It was very tasty, I would order it again. One of my pet peeves is when you order a burger medium and it comes out well done. This place cooked it perfectly. One star down because the bartender seemed like he was too cool for school and had better things to do than make suggestions to me. I like this place though!   I take it back... I just got my bill and it's $7.00 for a pint... Wtf! 2 beer were more than my burger."}
{"text":"Nice little spot in the neighborhood for good craft beer and food. They do a great happy hour on food and drinks. Friendly helpful staff. Kind of new so they are still working out a few bugs"}
{"text":"I would have liked to add this gastropub to our regular rotation given the proximity to our home, but it's not going to make the cut. We didn't experience anything supremely negative or offensive to provoke scathing feedback on food, service or atmosphere. Yet the asking price is just astounding given the quality of all three features.  First, service was very friendly. After some confusion with the hostesses about sitting at the community table, we opted to sit at the bar. The large table commonly referred to as a \"community table\" isn't actually a table they will seat multiple parties at - an odd policy. The bar inside was full, but the hostess reassured us that the patio was air-conditioned in the summer and very pleasant. So we obligingly headed outside very open minded about their ability to cool the space on a late afternoon in July. We quickly realized it's next to impossible to cool an outdoor patio in the Arizona summer, and, accepting own naiveté, we sat outside anyway. The bartender was very sweet.  While I perused the beer list, I kept squinting at the price thinking, \"Is this for a pint? $7?\" Compared to other venues who claim to have a diverse craft beer selection, these brews didn't resonate strongly with me. Settling for an API, I then chose the shrimp mac n cheese and a side of asparagus. Both were okay, but $11 for a tiny pot of mostly sauce and seriously overcooked noodles that fell apart at the touch of my fork? My husband really did not enjoy his burger which was sort of a mess, but the cheapest option amidst the entrees priced anywhere from $25-30. I started to get the feeling that we patrons are actually mini-tenants disguised as diners.   I understand that this remodel must have been expensive and the rent can't be cheap, but after paying $70 for 2 people, we did not walk away feeling even remotely satisfied. For the same price, you could have an exquisite meal at a gastropub in Old Town from a creative menu with stellar service (i.e. Citizen Public House style). For a much lower price, you could sit on an amazing patio and have decent food with a fun crowd (i.e. OHSO style). We won't risk another subprime experience at such an expense in the future."}
{"text":"Went to Taphouse Kitchen for the first time tonight and I am beyond impressed!!   Not only was the food amazing! But our server, Nicole, did an excellent job explaining the menu and taking care of us! The Old Fashion made by Damian was the best I've yet to have!   They also have a great selection for whiskey and wine! Perfect place to grab a drink or have a family dinner! Can't wait to come back and try their Sunday brunch!!"}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour! I recommend the Fish and Chips and wings! Service was great!"}
{"text":"Great place! Food is awesome and the service is even better! Best bartender I have found in Scottsdale! Very personable and pays attention to the customers! I will definitely be back soon and often!"}
{"text":"Pros:  1.  Great Service 2.  Very Family friendly 3.  Great feel and atmosphere w/ nice outdoor space 4.  Good beer selection 5.  Plenty of TV's at bar and on patio to keep up with sports 6.  Food items were very good:  spicy wings, shrimp Mac n cheese, airline chicken ( excellent very moist chicken, but mashed potatoes were a bit cold).    Cons:   1. None that I can think of!"}
{"text":"was in this area on a Tuesday night - even though some of the reviews were rough on service we decide to take a chance and I am glad we did.   We were greeted and sat immediately, given menus, asked for our drink orders - off to a good start.   Large beer and wine menu.   (a bit pricy, but you are in Scottsdale).      My husband and son both ordered the burger and said it was delicious along with the regular fries and sweet potato waffle fries.    I ordered the chicken and biscuits (not something I would normally order, but I knew the \"biscuits\" were gnocchi).  I think it is a genius and delicious idea - just wanted more of them!!   the broth was good and seasoned well - maybe just a tad too much broth, but see if you add more gnocchi it would be perfect!  :)       We were all too full for dessert, but I see us coming back and checking out the patio when the weather is better."}
{"text":"Wow. I wanted to not like this place thinking it was going to be hipster central. The menu is very interesting and I had trouble deciding on what I wanted. I decided to go with two appetizers to create a meal. The Lamb pops and hummus w/heirloom tomatoes, feta and grilled pita. Presentation was beautiful the lamb pops were beautiful cuts, beautifully grilled and seasoned and cooked to perfection. It was paired with a sweet mint salsa verde and some type of orange sauce. Both sauces complimented the lamb perfectly. The hummus was absolutely delicious and I loved the feta That's was sprinkled on. The pita bread was grilled and absolutely delicious. The presentation with cucumber rolls was both beautiful and delicious.  I highly recommend these 2 apps for a meal or as two apps to share with friends. I wish I was traveling alone and had someone to enjoy with! I will be back on my next trip to Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"Love coming here for a happy hour drink. I like the relaxed ambiance.  Wine on tap is fun- Jameson on tap is even better. They do have a happy hour menu - most things are $6. We ordered the wings and yes you only get four wings, but they are delicious and meaty.  Service is friendly and prompt. Have not had dinner here yet but will be back soon to try it."}
{"text":"We ate here yesterday for the first time.  We were really impressed with the service and the menu.  Everything we had was delicious, especially my Chicken and Dumplings.  Loved the Bloody Mary Bar.  In speaking with the server she told us about how good all of the food is here, and we certainly believe it!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Jessica our server was great! Kind and attentive. Food was wonderful and outdoor dining was comfortable and open. The rap playing over the radio was readon for one star take away as I was here dining with my kids and wife. Lil jon music belongs elsewhere."}
{"text":"The fish and chips (walleye) were amazing.  The sliders with the sauce and quail eggs was delicious and unique.   Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"Maybe it was just me, but I couldn't make anything work here. Wine was warm, second wine was served in the same glass (gross), the server was much more interested in taking inventory than waiting on customers, she didn't inform me that there was a happy hour menu, the first iced tea was good but when I had to ask a different server for the second one, which he brought from the back of the restaurant, it was old and undrinkable. The grilled cheese sandwich was pretty good but I was not a fan of the lamb pops. The flavor profile didn't work at all and I like spicy food.  To be honest, I was there late lunch and so they didn't have their grove on yet, but I was not impressed."}
