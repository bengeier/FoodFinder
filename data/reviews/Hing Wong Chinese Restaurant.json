{"text":"This restaurant's popularity is more than likely hampered by its obscure location and outdated facade. At first glance, this small take-out-only restaurant could easily be mistaken for a condemned building. Once inside,circa 1960's ill faded asian murals and backlit signs illuminate food options.
  A husband and wife, who speak little english, but fully understand the language, greet you promptly. They use authentic 'fire breathing dragon' stoves for their woks. Every ingredient is chopped fresh and made to order. i.e ginger, vegetables, raw meats.
  Their prices are very reasonable considering the large quantity given. Around $7 per meal with rice included. Most dishes are authentic non-Americanized asian food. MSG free with every ingredient uniquely represented. Many of their fried foods are drained of oil before being incorporated into the saucy wok.
  A must try restaurant indeed."}
{"text":"Such great food not ready for our appetites! I saw Judith B.'s post about this wonderful restaurant re-opening in Springdale. I wish some member of the family would let us all know where and when. I'm tired of buffets and restaurants that prepare frozen Chinese dishes. Give us the authentic and tasty Hing Wong menu items!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"General Tso's was fantastic and actually spicy! Sadly they tore down the building it was in. Does anybody know if they relocated?"}
{"text":"Delicious local Chinese take-out.  Excellent hot and sour soup.  Lo mein is very good.  Reasonable prices.  Friendly staff."}
{"text":"The Dragon and Phoenix is like no other.  Restaurant has indicated they are possibly reopening in another location in Springdale soon.  Personally, I can hardly wait!!"}
{"text":"I love the beef lo mein so much I can't bring myself to order anything else on the menu! But I have tried my husband's General Tso Chicken which was good albeit not super sweet how I prefer it. The hot and sour soup is yummy with fresh mushrooms and celery among other things. My small children enjoyed the sweet & sour chicken and the crunchy battered lemon chicken. My cousin raves about their crab rangoon. The fried egg rolls appear to be rolled fresh with fresh veggies. Definitely not the usual frozen then fried stuff I've had at every single Chinese restaurant I've ever been to. It's a pretty ugly on the outside but the family who runs it is friendly and efficient. We've finally found a decent Chinese place here! Yay!"}
{"text":"A modest take-out location tucked into a strip mall, but definitely the most delicious Chinese food we've found in the area. The pork lo mein was incredible, as were the crab rangoons! The food was made quickly and portions were generous."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese restaurant in the area. Good food, great prices, decent portions. So glad they're back!"}
{"text":"Very tasty food.  Was not too excited when son of staff walked up to get my credit card and sneezed all over the card and counter without covering face and handed it back to me."}
{"text":"We partake in HingWong 2 or 3 times per month! No MSG, affordable and delicious! Half the price of a premiere Chinese restaurant a few miles south! Authentic and recommended... Don't let the awful facade and outdated interior steer you away. Enjoy."}
