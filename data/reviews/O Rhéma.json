{"text":"We bought a coupon on ILoveMtl for a 3-courses-meal worth 84$ for 2 persons (cost us 46$). Our reservation was supposed to be at 8pm, but we took a chance and got there around 5:30pm. The place isn't big and most of the tables were seated. Hopefully, the waitress was so nice and managed to find us a table for 2.

Since I wasn't really familiar with haitian food, our waitress took the time to expain to us the menu and we finally choose these dishes: accras and coconut milk shrimps as appetizers and beef tasso and marinated tilapia as main dishes. The accras a typical haitian dish and it's a fried cod fish, it was really tasty! We also loved the coconut sauce in which came the shrimps; it had a subtle coconut aroma with a buttery taste. Beef tasso & tilapia fish both came with sticky rice, fried plantain banana and pikliz (super spicy marinated salad). We didn't regretted our choices, each bite was a pure delight. The portion were reasonnable for good apetite people. In the end, we got the dessert of the day, which was a lemon cake, instead of the potato bread on the menu. The cake was good with a moisty texture (i hate dry spongy cakes), but it wasn't my favorite part of the dinner.

I loved the place:
-it had a trendy interior without requiring a high class dress code
-staff was very welcoming & helpful
-food was delicious
-it's a bring your own wine

I would definitely recommend it to anyone who would like to try West Indies food.

P.S Reservation is strongly recommended during weekend & please note the restaurant isn't opened on mondays."}
{"text":"As a Chinese decent person, I always tell non Asian friends not to go to an Asian restaurant if they see no Asian person inside as it is an indication that the food is not authentic.

Well most of the tables in that restaurant were of black origin so I was reassured of the quality and authenticity of the food!

Shared the curry coconut shrimps and they were delicious! Also took an entree of accras which I found were a bit weird as the texture was different than what I'm normally used to. It was kinda bouncy...weird but ok tasting.

My friend then took the grio plate and I took to beef plate (cant remember the name). Although both plates were decent, my friend who is Haitian told me that you can pay under $10 at cantine in Montreal north and have double the portion and similar taste.

Overall nice byow Haitian restaurant with good service."}
{"text":"L'ambiance est intime. C'est préférable de réserver puisque le resto est petit. Apportez votre vino ou non, vous pouvez boire un jus glacé et onctueux comme un pina colada, ça ajoute à l'ambiance caribéenne. Impossible de commander un plat qui ne sera pas mangeable, TOUT est bon. S'en est presque triste quand il faut choisir! On vient ici avec des amis, des amours, des gens plaisants et qui ont de la jasette. Le service est attentionné, les plats sortent de la cuisine quand le cuisinier les juge parfaits, ça peut prendre du temps, d'où l'importance d'être bien entouré! La nourriture est abondante et cuite avec beaucoup d'amour et une bonne dose d'huile, préparez-vous à en ramener à la maison. Je reviendrais sans hésiter, mais je ne commanderais pas d'entrée, car je n'avais plus faim pour mon plat principal."}
