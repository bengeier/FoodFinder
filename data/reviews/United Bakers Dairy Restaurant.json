{"text":"Be sure to check your takeout order before you leave and maybe even taste it in the case of fish, i have been served foul tasting fish at this place before or perhaps don't get takeout at all at this place. If there is any error in your order, you will be branded a liar and a cheat."}
{"text":"Honestly, I am not sure what is so great about this place. 

Overall the food is very bland, which is on par for restaurants in this part of Toronto. 

We ordered the shakshouka. The shakshouka tasted like chili with eggs that I could have made at home. The pita was ok. 

The eggs and lax was marginally better but still bland overall. The bagels were ok but they only gave you butter and jam to put on it, would have been better with some cream cheese. 

Its nice that you get quick service on the coffee, but the coffee is also flavorless. 

The place seems packed, so people must like it, but we left underwhelmed. 

One positive sit that the seating inside is nice and they have free parking in the mall complex that they are located in."}
{"text":"Been going here since I was two years old. My favourite spot in the bathurst and lawrence area. Pea soup and the fish and chips are my favourite! Reasonably priced. If getting a bagel, ask for a gryfes!"}
{"text":"\"See, you know how to take the reservation, you just don't know how to *hold* the reservation and that's really the most important part of the reservation, the holding. Anybody can just take them.\"--Jerry, \"Seinfeld,\" episode: The Alternate Side

That's exactly what happened to our group of 11. United Bakers *took* Shari M.'s reservation for 11 people at 12 noon but didn't really know how to *hold* the reservation. That's how we wound up waiting nearly an hour for brunch. 

While waiting, I carefully strategized what I was going to order: a bowl of soup and smoked whitefish on a bagel. I even scrutinized the bread bins in the takeout area to see which bagels looked optimal for my brunch. The sesame bagels looked too doughy and under-baked while the plain ones lacked the requisite healthy shine. Their signature twisty bagel looked more like a braided Kaiser roll. Pfft. I decided that I would order a marble bagel because it looked the chewiest and shiniest of them all. So, I'm a bagel snob. Sue me.

When we finally got seated, I was the last one to order only to find out THEY WERE OUT OF SMOKED WHITEFISH! I was crestfallen. Like here was my crest, and there it went, boom, on the floor. I settled for the lox appetizer.

Luckily, United Bakers were able to redeem themselves a bit with their bowl of beet borscht ($4), served with boiled potatoes and sour cream which satisfied the now ravenous mob of proletarians on the brink of revolting in my stomach. The lox appetizer ($8.50) appeased me with 5 strips of melt-in-your-mouth lox to go on my pre-ordained marble bagel which remained pretty good untoasted. I also got about 4 tablespoons of luxurious cream cheese for an extra $2.50.

Our waitress was a cheeky older lady full of back-sass and vinegar. I loved her. The vibe there is noisy and hectic. I estimate that the roving busboys and busgirls offered to refill our coffee cups six times. 

Would I make the schlep from downtown again? Yes, but not with 10 other people and only after I'd confirmed they have smoked whitefish in stock.

P.S. The restaurant is Kosher-style, i.e., they have dairy and fish but no meat. Do not come here expecting bacon and eggs."}
{"text":"I'm really surprised with all the rave about this place. I've been here a few times and always walked out with a bad experience.

First off, I feel like I'm eating at a cafeteria with service- sorry. The service is good and efficient and the food portions were small, inexpensive, and bad tasting. Now, I always came here with a bunch of friends, and they did not like the place either. I've had several of dishes here and my food had either been overdone, underdone, dull tasting or cold. 

I really tried liking this place, it's too bad. I won't be back here again."}
{"text":"One of the other reviewers for this restaurant was right...this place feels like a cafeteria with service.  And the food tastes like cafeteria food too!  I don't understand why people love this place."}
{"text":"United Bakers Dairy Restaurant always makes me happy. I always order the exact same thing and I am never disappointed: The Greek salad is perfection. Ditto the split pea with noodles (you have to request them). I always joke that I want to get a spy in the kitchen to see how they make it. It's that good. I also love the bagels, and I sometimes get a scoop of white fish or tuna to go with it. All of the food is very share-able because the portions are large. I read a review on this site that complained they weren't, which is ridiculous. These are normal-sized portions. The only thing that could be improved is the coffee, but who cares? I can go to a cafe for that. Oh, and I always stop at the bakery in front for a doughnut. Perfect to go with that takeaway coffee. Keep it up, United!"}
{"text":"Nathan- I've had your 'copious' breakfasts. (Weekdays before 11am). The yogurt parfait with berries and granola came with 3 raspberries and 3 blueberries (and bananas which I was unaware are berries). But the eggs are a good deal."}
{"text":"One of the best Greek Salads north of the city. Ingredients include iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, pitted olives, celery, egg, cucumber, green pepper, feta cheese, and onions (I ask for without). Ask for your salad chopped and mixed so that you don't have to go through the tedious and often injury provoking behaviour (choking) of cutting your celery or just eating it as is. In addition, ask for the creamy spinach dressing on the side. It's good for a dip here and there.

If you're really feeling adventurous, order a scoop of tuna on the side for some additional protein.

My move: Small Greek Salad tossed and mixed with both dressings on the side. A pumpernickel bagel toasted with cup of cream cheese. When you get the bagel, scoop out the middle, add cream cheese and Greek salad in the grooves and, with your fork, add some spinach dressing for some added flavour. Of course, never leave the middle of your bagel uneaten - it's embarassing. Take the middle section and dip it in the dressing. Amazingness all around.

Go early (before 11am) or late lunch (2pm) to avoid the lines."}
{"text":"I must be missing something. This place is brutally bad and expensive. Will not return even if it is free"}
{"text":"A family run, Jewish institution! Best pea soup in the city. I've been enjoying the delicious food here for 20+ years and its a staple in the community. Fast, polite staff, and priced affordably."}
{"text":"Truly one of Toronto's finest institutions! One visit to UB and you'll see why it has been around for over a century! Even if it is your first visit, you'll quickly feel at home at this family establishment. 

Recipes that have been passed down for generations have been perfected -- especially what is easily the best Split Pea Soup in the city (maybe the world?!). I would also highly recommend the Greek Salad/Spring Mix Salad, and if you are so inclined for a taste of Jewish comfort food, get a scoop of the Whitefish and some potato latkes.

The extensive menu boasts enough choices for every member of the family. 

A family restaurant for family, by family. Can't get better than this!"}
{"text":"Classic establishment in Toronto with Jewish dairy foods.  Whitefish salad was mild, good. Blintz was large decent tasting - a little dry inside but helped with sour cream.  Bagels were fine - nothing special unless very fresh - our sesame bagel was great, but poppy a little old. Spinach salad decent size and great tasting."}
{"text":"UB is a go-to. Lots of choices on the menu, friendly staff, and a casual atmosphere. Always an enjoyable meal! Pea soup, cabbage soup, cheese blintzes, lox platter, Greek salad, and the tuna are just some of my favorites. Wish they had a second location downtown closer to where I live to be able to eat there more often!"}
{"text":"How many Dairy Delis have you been to?  Odds are it's zero.  Well, United Bakers is, as far as I'm concerned, the dominant dairy deli in the world.  I dream about their whitefish salad, that's how good it is.  No trip to Toronto is complete without this place..."}
{"text":"This is a bit of a delayed review (5 days), but I guess I was a tad underwhelmed by my breakfast.

The eggs and onions were ok, the home fries sub-standard, the coffee pretty average, the bagel excellent.  That's my meal.

2 of my breakfast-mates had the blintzes, and loved them.

I still like coming here though...the vibe is like comfort food for my soul."}
{"text":"Service is always friendly and competent. When you feel dinerish but not in the mood for meat without wanting a hardcore vegan place, UBD is for you. In over 12 years, I have had almost every menu item except gefilte and was always happy. Today I dig in the smoked salmon platter.  A good portion of lox, tonatoes, cucumbers, cream cheese and a toasted twister bagel for 14.99. Delicious! I warmly recommend it."}
{"text":"Even though I have not been in Toronto for more than seven years, I still lust for their delicious soups, decadent whitefish salad, and scrumptious challah. 
Don't be daunted by the long lines - the tables turn quickly!"}
{"text":"Sunday brunch with my (Israeli) mum. The plan was to go for an Indian buffet, but then a light bulb went off in her head and she said 'let's go to United Bakers' instead. Well, I haven't lived in Toronto for nearly 20 years and before that, only ventured to that neck of the woods once. But I was happy for the change of plans..
Having grown up with 2 Jewish parents; one Ashkenazi and the other Sephardic/Yemenite, my taste for these things is strong...and I was not disappointed. I loved the famous Pea soup that I tasted from mum's bowl, but even more was the smoked salmon plate with a twisted bagel. I was stuffed by the end and it was hard for me to think of even looking at the counter for take out bagels and pastries. However, I succumbed and got half a dozen bagels for the work week and a salmon patty that I'm going to eat as soon as I finish this review. 
My only only issue was that there wasn't any poppy seed hamintashen (spelling) left when we were done. Heart-broken!! Maybe next Purim we'll go back. 
Lovely staff. Lovely food. I will return."}
{"text":"I took a minute to read the reviews already here and it was interesting.  There are those that get United Dairy and those that don't.  Yeah it is like a time warp, yeah the food for the most part is so so and yeah the waitress look like they walked off the set of \"Alice\" .  But that is not what UD is about.  Like Tom's Restaurant in Seinfeld, the lunch counter at Woolworth's or Fran's down on college st. UD is about the over all experience.  It is about the chat, the people, the taking a moment to go back in time. Not every dining experience is about acting like some overly pretentious faux foodie and for that reason UD is a four star winner and a frequent feeding stop.  I'll have the tuna melt on a twister please, with mayo on the side for my fries."}
{"text":"In one word lousy! i felt sorry for the waitress, she was a little old lady who couldn't hear. Therefore she kept bringing wrong things each time. The Gefilte fish was beyond awful. The Spanish Omelet wasn't too good either nor was the overly cinnamon Rice Pudding with the consistency of old Oatmeal. Even the fresh honeydew Melon chunks were cut too close to the rind. The one bright spot was the pea soup and cabbage borscht."}
{"text":"OMG - can I say \"g-d\" while reviewing this restaurant? - SO GOOD.

My sister, a pescatarian (those vegetarians who eat fish), dragged me here today because she knew she can eat anything on the menu, as it's a dairy (no meat) restaurant.  When we got there, I was craving a chicken noodle soup -- as I had been omitted this important detail.

Instead, I settled on the lox and cream cheese platter.  First of all, let me say that service was excellent.  Fast, friendly, the lady was incredibly nice.  The hostess, without prompt, pushed two tables together even though there was just two of us, for no reason other than niceness.  The lox platter was gigantic, the twister was delicious, and I longed for a raw onion -- and then the waitress pointed out it was hiding under the lettuce leaf on my plate.

Too bad it's so far from my obvious 'hood, downtown.  Otherwise I'd be there at least once a week."}
{"text":"Tried to go in for lunch on a Saturday with hubbie and the in-laws and the lineup was out the door.  Went back on Monday and we all shared a serving of 6 latkes, hubbie ordered the tuna melt on a twisted bagel, Mother-in-law had cream cheese and bagel and Father-in-law and I both ordered the cheese blintzes.  The food was okay, hubbie and I thought the food was a little bland and I like my latkes more lacy rather than pancake like, but ma & pa in-law really like this place.  The portions are huge - we all took home portions of our orders and the lady who served us was really sweet and nice.  A solid place for blandish home Jewish cooking.  It's a busy place and the parking lot is a bit of a nightmare."}
{"text":"I likes me this place. What I like the best about it is the craziness. 

Some fellow Yelpers and I headed to Bathurst & Lawrence after much Kosher talk to get our bagel on. A reservation was made...but reservations don't count for much at United. If there is a large group, go before noon and these hard working ladies will ensure you get seated. You may wait a bit, but the experience makes it worth your while. 

The latkes are quite good - prob some of the best I have ever had!  Nice and thick and not too greasy.  They are served with sour cream and apple sauce on the side.

The twister bagel (I feel it is mandatory to do a twisty dance when you describe it, and while you eat it - particularly if it causes rolled eyes from Dale \"as an economist\" M), was gouda. A little more \"bun\" than \"bagel\" but this puppy was huge. I was only able to eat half. 

I had an omelet and salad as well. Both were fine, but as other reviewers said, the flavouring is a bit bland here. 

Note that this is a dairy restaurant, so no meat in sight. If like Danielle \"my backup singer\" P, you are hankering for some gravy (and duh...who isn't 24/7?!), you won't get any here. Its okay, its okay, put the protest signs down, cause what United has done is made this luxurious dip. It looks like ass but tastes like heaven. Susan \"purveyor of fine bagels\" C believes it is a combo of mayo, sour cream, lemon and some other tasty treats. I would have to agree with her. But regardless, it is fabulous. 

If you are in the area (please check out Winners in this plaza!!!) and want to have huge portions, go here. If you want some mystifying fast service and almost snarly waitresses that you will fall in love with, go here."}
{"text":"Amazing lox and cream cheese sandwiches. Delicious desserts - especially the rumballs!!! You have to try them!

Casual setting. Staff weren't the best at customer service but that's okay. I would come back here anyways."}
{"text":"The incredible line up out the door really made me think this place would be amazing, but alas, it was not. The service was snarky and unpleasant, and my sandwich was gross. I got tuna on a multi-grain bagel to go - the tuna was bland, the lettuce was wilted and the tomatoes were half green and half soggy. It came to 10 bucks with a bottle of water (10 bucks!?!). Next time I'll take my money to the grocery store across the street, buy all the ingredients, make it myself (and enjoy it),  and invest the change in a high interest savings account."}
{"text":"Being pescetarian, hungry and pseudo-Jewish, I might be expected to exalt this place. Sadly, I do not.

Despite the wonderful dairy restaurant menu, the bagels are underwhelming and the portions are teeny-weeny. The pea soup ($4.89) is delicious but the bowl is what most establishments would call a \"cup\". I can only assume their \"half-bowl\" is a spoonful. What actually IS a spoonful are the sides you receive with the \"platters\" ($9.99-$10.49 for tuna/salmon/whitefish salad). Don't most restaurants practically give away coleslaw and fries just to fill up the plate?

Their cheese blintzes are also good, but if there is a blintz out there that is worth $7 apiece, I haven't met it. And I meet a lot of blintzes.

In summation: United Bakers is an institution, but obviously not for its value. Bring your Bubby, enjoy the lively atmosphere, then go to Gryfe's afterward to fill the rest of your stomach."}
{"text":"I just happened upon this wonderful place today for lunch and wow! 

The tuna sandwich on dark rye was incredibly delicious for what I thought was \"just tuna\" but then, oh, the pea soup!!   I can't believe the flavor, such delicate richness...it was like being at your grandmother's...I felt deeply satisfied after this lunch. 

Lol, I will be going back!!"}
{"text":"If you want to pay top dollar for hospital food this is the place for you! The service and attitude you get from the wait staff is pretty bad too. They got my order wrong and I had to approach the group standing around chit chatting to get any service.

Did I mention the food was low quality? 

Visit your dad/grandma/etc in the long term care facility and help them finish off their dinner tray for the same food and attitude."}
{"text":"Seen this place a million times but never went in. Just glanced at the bakery area in the front. Didn't realize there was a hidden gem of a restaurant behind the bakery. 
Love the seating arrangement like an old school diner ( not exactly, but I hope you get what I mean when you see it), mirrored ceiling adds the only fancy element to it. The menu is also old school and basic perfectly matching the look of the restaurant. 
Servers were nice. You have to wait outside to be seated.  
We ordered a mozzarella tuna melt on rye and golden waffles...also some coffee. The food was good looking and delicious. Would definitely go again to try the lox and other such items that they offer. They made a simple tuna melt delicious and it was perfectly gratinated.  That shows they have good standards and care a lot about the quality of food they put out."}
{"text":"I was in Toronto visiting family for the Thanksgiving holiday and my dad's friend took us to this place for dinner. I had the salmon, which was outstanding. It was moist, but flakey. The veggies on the side were really good, too. I also had a bagel, which was quite good and normally I don't like Toronto bagels. I thought it was a little pricey, but I can't complain. Everyone at our party liked their meals a lot. 

My father liked it so much that him and I went back a few days later for coffee and a black bagel, which was excellent. 

I go to Toronto every three months to visit and I will definitely be going back to this place."}
{"text":"United bakers is one of the places in Toronto where you know exactly what you are getting, a 100+ year old establishment that is simply delicious, old world soul food. 
It is a great place for brunch with the family or just quick lunch. Always good and always fresh."}
{"text":"Its a great place to meet for a quick 'nosh'. This place is only dairy, so no meat. Their baked goods are great, the breads fresh and tasty and the portions substantial. The only negative was that they make their so-called greek salad with shredded feta, but I should not expect a good greek salad there. The service is good, but a bit hurried.

Their dark rye is awesome, as is the cabbage borscht. This place is always busy, and noisy, but it is a landmark.

I will continue to go there."}
{"text":"?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ?????poppy seed bagel????????????3????????bagel???poppy seed??????????????????????"}
{"text":"YUM! I agree with all the positive reviews of this place. Though the line-ups can be daunting, the comfort food is worth the wait. Pea soup is delish! Greek salad, also one of my faves -- with that creamy dressing. And bagels... lots of bagels. Makes me long for Sunday morning brunch now, just thinking about it. 
Don't kvetch about the lineups... or the schlep up north (from downtown)... just sit back, sip your coffee and indulge!!"}
{"text":"My favourite Jewish bakery and delicatessen. Great service, great baked goods, great salads, soups, sandwiches and entrées. They even have a great Vegetarian chopped liver sandwich. 

The place is also very clean and the price is reasonable. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"If you are afraid of hordes of Bubbie's and Zaidie's don't go here.  If you are afraid of loud noise, don't go here.  If you don't like some of those loud Bubbie's and Zaidie's staring at you while you eat, then don't go here.

But if you can withstand all that, enough, to taste their rich, thick pea soup, or potato soup, then go here.  You can even get those soups in takeout.  Along with a host of other baked goods up front.  

There are loads of seats, though you might have to wait for a little bit, because it is always packed.

I've had your classic tuna, chopped egg, cream cheese and lox, all with bagels and they are healthy portions and fresh and tasty. Ive had a croissant tuna melt which wasn't bad - a little soggy from what I remember.

But if you want great Jewish food - and I believe it is kosher-style, not Kosher - you should come here and expect very attentive and brusque service - these ladies tell it like it is and at the same time know how to deal with complainers.  The parking lot is the worst though, always packed.  But worth getting over to sit down for a little herring."}
{"text":"My parents love this place and have taken me here twice so far and both times were enjoyable. Waitresses on both nights were very nice and efficient. Judging by the amount of people dining (young and old) as well as the line up for the bakery, it's safe to say this joint is popular for a reason.

The food is delicious. I recommend getting the soup-of-the-day as the potato (on Sundays) is very tasty and my parents tell me all the soups are just as good. Tonight I had the club sandwich with lox and cream cheese on rye bread and it was the bomb -- it melted in my mouth. Lots of coffee refills, too. I dig this place"}
{"text":"A Jewish institution in business for over 100 years, now located in the very mediocre Lawrence Plaza.  It wasn't until my third visit that I didn't realize they don't have meat or poultry on the menu- just traditional fish and dairy.

Breakfast is fast, friendly and excellent.  Try any one of the scoops or platters, or go with an omelette.  There are many better bagel options in the neighbourhood, but their twister bagels are decent.

The standout tip for this place: the split pea soup.  Homemade daily and served with noodles, we always get a 1 liter take-out container after our meal.  They have other alternating soups made daily, but the split pea is on every day and ready by 8am.

If your kid tolerance is low, avoid weekend mornings, as it is packed with families with young children.  After half a dozen visits, we haven't had a bad experience yet."}
{"text":"Although I try not to echo my fellow Yelpers' previous reviews, I'd like to echo my fellow Yelpers' previous reviews. This place is most definitely an uptown \"institution\". I think pretty much every Jew in Toronto has eaten here at least once, or continues to eat here regularly, with or without their bubby and zaida (usually with).

Highlights for me at United Bakers--aka United Dairy, aka \"United\"--include the tuna (def one of my favourite tunas in the city) and the famous split pea soup (heartwarming)...other great bets are the Greek salad, the noodles and cheese (served hot), and the eggplant parmesan. They have nice baked goods as well.

Oy vey that's a good Jewish diner!"}
{"text":"It's hard to hate this place. What they do well is always amazing. The pea soup is legendary, and the salads are great.

A beginner should always try the pea soup; it would be stupid not to. The breakfast options are generally good too -- omelets, bagels, etc. (no bacon/sausages, of course). Scrambled egg sandwiches on bagels are a great take-out breakfast option. The kreplach are delicious for those seeking comfort food, but should not be ordered by those on a health kick. In terms of salads, the spinach salad and Greek salad are big and delicious. And the scoop platters (egg salad, tuna salad, etc., with vegetables) are a good choice to order with the soup.

The service isn't always stellar. Several of the waitresses, it seems, have worked here longer than I have been living; and some of them can be surly if you catch them on the wrong day. But it wouldn't be United Bakers without this.

Be well aware that it can get packed around lunchtime on weekends. Even with a big plaza parking lot outside, parking may be tough to find at those times, requiring a few loops around and some muffled cursing at inconsiderate people who (seem to) think their rush is more important than yours... but it's kind of all part of the charm.

If the frenetic lunch rush, the waitresses, or the terrible parking etiquette intimidate you, get a Jewish friend to take you through it. :)"}
{"text":"There are a variety of homestyle food options available at this Jewish dairy diner located in the less than remarkable strip mall that is the Lawrence Plaza. As a dairy diner they uphold the practice to - \"never, never, never, mix milk and mat together!\" and so meat is a no go. They serve your typical fair from sandwiches to, omelets, to lox platters and barley soup. 

The pricing ~$9-14, is surprisingly higher than I would expect given the rather lackluster atmosphere, service and general food selection. The dishes are generallly what you'd expect your Bubby (grandmother) to serve up on a Sunday afternoon: simple, a bit bland, but it gets the job done. The baked items were the best things here by far and I enjoyed my buttered sesame bagel. Overall, I don't think I'd make a habit out of coming back as the few times that I've eaten here haven't been anything to write home about...(thankfully that's why there's Yelp). You can't really go wrong here, but for tastiness and value points, it misses the mark."}
{"text":"Although I live very close to this place, I don't usually jump at the opportunity to visit United Bakers, something about an all dairy diner (that does not meet Kosher requirements) doesn't appeal to me.

However, they have not been in business for 100+ years for nothing. What they do, they do well, and locals know that. They have a warm and inviting atmosphere with low lighting. A varied menu which makes you not (usually) miss the meat and generally when I end up here I enjoy what I've ordered.

Their soups, baked goods, and eggs are probably my favourite items on the menu. 

However, I should mention that despite an aging clientele, they are not accessible. They will do what needs to be done to get someone in a wheelchair inside but it's not always easy. 

It's worth a visit if you have never been and all I can say is that I hope they remain in business for another 100+ years!"}
{"text":"It is the first restaurant I visited in Toronto and the experience was amazing.
We ordered Tuna melt and golden waffle both the dishes were amazing. 
The servers were also really nice. 
I am really impressed by the quality of food here and also the ambience of the restaurant and will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"I did a take away and was happy to experience a Toronto institution.  The gefilte fish (pepper) was my friends favorite. I also tried the cabbage bundle- served veggie without the meat as this is a dairy restaurant.  
I also tried the oatmeal and chocolate chip cookies.  Both thin and good.  Next time I want to eat in and get the full on United Bakers experience.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Best dairy resto in the area. Must try the pea soup. I also love the pizza bagel. Portions are big and food is hearty."}
{"text":"It's not the food.   There's no way.    It couldn't be.

MInd numbingly predictable and served with an exclusive sulk of indifference.     Your order arrives mere moments after it's placed.   It's underwhelming and expected.   People eat the same thing, almost as if by rote. 

Sure, there are those who swear by the pea soup here.   But their competitive set probably doesn't include many restaurants without the word 'bagel' in the title. 

But this is the spot that you come to for the community.      

It's the defacto town square for a specific set of folk.   It serves this role better than anywhere else in the city.   Booths are low. There are mirrors on the ceiling.   You can scan every face in the room from any seat in the place.      And that's what it's all about. 

This is an environment where you can kibbutz and hear all the gossip on one side while listening to kvetches complain about their problems on the other.   You risk your life in the perilous parking lot just to wait in line as you're scanned by a thousand eyeballs, each with a loudly expressed opinion.

Someone once told me that more business deals get made at UB than any other place in town.   I believe this to be true. 

Definitely an experience."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant! Delicious Jewish food, extremely fast service and kid-friendly. I have had the tuna Reuben and the smoke salmon sandwich, both excellent choices. They have cheese blintzes, hamentashen, and other delectable treats."}
{"text":"Toronto's oldest family restaurant :O  Interior is pretty old school but def got a nice family feel :)  Was pretty busy when we went on a Saturday morning, the front of the restaurant had a pastry section which we visited after finishing breakfast to grab some biscotti and chocolate croissant to go. 

I ordered the Eggs and Lox (smoked salmon), which came with some raw veggies and coleslaw (I decided to forgo the French fries due to sudden health urge haha) Also comes with a choice of bread and bagel.  I enjoyed the dish - simple and definitely filling.  Also tried the Shakshouka - which was eggs dipped in tomato sauce - best eaten with the bagel/bread! 

Overall,  the chocolate croissant was the highlight of my trip there.  Nice place to try if you're ever around the area for breakfast or brunch :)"}
{"text":"Picture this:  it's any month, 2008, you are waiting in line in a packed, garishly lit, immense room, ethnic ramblings are bouncing off tables, booths, and walls, elderly ladies in uniform are pushing you out of the way to get past you with trays of strange food, someone calls \"Erin, party of two,\" you look up at the mirrored ceiling and you see your own reflection, you scream, it's your turn, you have a seat at United Baker's.

The U.B, a Kosher dairy restaurant in the Jewish area of Toronto, has been a tried and true for decades.  The place offers hearty soups, traditional Jewish staples like smoked whitefish, lox, potato pancakes, and cabbage rolls.  They also have regular Joe foods, like eggs, grilled cheeses etc.  But my go-to is the Greek Salad.  Even if you have an appetite like refrigerator Perry, don't stray from the small, it is massive.  If you are really hungry get a twister bagel on the side.    

Let's put it this way, if United Baker's was on Mount SInai when Moses lost his temper, he would have gone into the restaurant calmed down with some rye toast and a bowl of pea soup, come out refreshed, and those cursed broken tablets would have been spared."}
{"text":"This place needs to be updated it looks old and run down. It's a very busy restaurant as well. We went in for a coffee and a tea and it came out to $4.20 so if you have money this is the place to come. The waitresses are arrogant at least the one we had and if you like the mentality of the people in there then this is the place for you"}
{"text":"If you go to this place at ANY time of day - You would think that people in Toronto don't work.

Boss took me out for lunch here and we had to wait 20 min for table. 
This place is a gold mine. 
Although it's packed the service it quick and they don't forget about you.
I had the potato pancakes plus the pea soup (which is their specialty apparently  - very tasty).  

Not much to look at in this place because it's a greasy diner, but you're in and out quite fast so they can clear people out and get the next ones in. 

I will have to come back here for other Jewish cravings and to try their other homecooked meals!

Mazel Tov !!!!"}
{"text":"Get the Shakshouka! So delicious. The latkes are also great. Perfect place to grab a quick lunch. The servers and ladies at the counter are very efficient, and there are so many options to choose from!"}
{"text":"So I'm schlepping around Toronto and it's in the 90's in May!?! and I'm mostly hating life. And what to my wondering eyes should appear? A dairy-bakery restaurant place!!
Kind of an adventure finding the restrooms to clean up before eating... down about 80 stairs and left through three doors; waste baskets at each door for the return trip is a nice touch.
Generously filled tuna with lots of melt on a twisted bagel, slaw, tomato, and breakfast potatoes plus coffee refills with the only smile I've seen in days."}
{"text":"There's not much else to say but:
GREEK SALAD AND PEA SOUP!!!!! AND MAC AND CHEESE !!! 

This dairy Resturant is a staple in Toronto. If you're Jewish, you grew up coming here. 

I've never had a bad meal here, everything is made fresh and oh so good!!!

It's always busy but it's a large Resturant so don't worry 

Great kids menu and there's honestly something for everyone!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've started a tradition recently with 2 of my friends. 

Essentially we go to a place like this early every Wednesday morning and get breakfast. I was hesitant to go here because it's a bit out of my way when I have to head to work in the other direction. I'm converted to United Bakers. It's not packed in the mornings and the service is great. I don't feel rushed and am able to get a great meal at a great price. 

I usually get 2 eggs sunny side up with potatoes and a Poppyseed Twister Bagel and a cup of Coffee. I love the place and I love this tradition.

Can't wait for next Wednesday!"}
{"text":"I can tell a good bagel from an meh bagel as its in my DNA.

I got a bag of twisters, looking forward to having one.  It tasted like challah and did not have a bagel like consistency ... 

I then wanted to order some cake products and the woman behind the counter just seemed to want me out of there and on to the next customer.  Let's just say I won't be rushing back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Haven't been here for a while.  The food was pretty good.  I had the large Greek salad \"tossed\" which actually doesn't mean tossed it means chopped. Haha the waitress neglected to tell me that. The ambience was a little more \"meshuga\" than usual. There was a woman sitting at the table behind us saying that if a man sends you a text message it is a virus. 

All in all it was good. Not sure what happened to their bagels they are not boiled anymore and weren't as tasty as they used to be."}
{"text":"I can't believe this was my first time here! 

Situated in an up and coming (very busy) plaza, this is a no-nonsense dairy restaurant that has something for everyone.  

When I walked in, it was packed! A huge crowd was waiting to be seated, the lineup went very quickly and soon we were seated. This part is a bit disorganized, I think they'd benefit from some stanchions or something to organize the line a bit, people were all crowded around, and a clear line couldn't really be distinguished leaving some people getting ahead of others who had been waiting first. 

The restaurant is quite large, we were seated in the main dining area but I hear there's also a back portion of the restaurant. Servers and hosts were working like well oiled machines, it was quite the spectacle, people constantly in and out, it really never stopped or slowed down once so if you're looking for a relaxing, quiet atmosphere, this is not your place. It's an older looking place, I can imagine it invokes memories and feelings of nostalgia to those who've been coming for some of the 100+ Years they've been open. There's a great deli at the front of the restaurant as well where you can take home some soup, sandwiches and baked goods.

Service was really prompt and efficient. The server seemed to know the regular patrons and was able to chat with them without skipping a beat. Our meals came out really quickly and nothing was missed or out of place. Coffee and water was also refilled regularly. 

The food is your typical Jewish dairy, no meat on the menu, but you wouldn't notice or even care for that matter. I tried the famous pea soup with noodles and it was delicious. It had some vegetables in it and wasn't overly thick like most split pea soups. I especially enjoyed the addition of noodles, unexpected but so good! Next I had the smoked salmon platter which included a scoop of cream cheese, a very generous serving of salmon, some onion, cucumber and tomato and a twister bagel. I enjoyed the bagel a lot, unlike some twister bagels, this one was lighter and I was actually able to finish it. The smoked salmon was delicious, thick cut and fresh tasting, I really enjoyed it.

Overall I can't wait to come back, one visit and I'm ready to be a regular. The Mac and cheese seemed to be a popular choice so I'd probably go with that and a side of the pea soup!"}
{"text":"Had a sumptuous and incidentally kosher brekkie at United Bakers Dairy Restaurant, just 3 days before Christmas & 2 days before Hanukkah. We pigged out and then did last minute shopping at nearby Camp Connection and Addition-Elle in the same plaza. What we had: 2 of the Lox + Cream Cheese Platter, recommended for the very fresh cucumber, leaf lettuce, tomato slices and purple onion slices that accompany the excellent smoked salmon, thick blob of rich cream cheese and optional big twister bagel (recommended upgrade) and coffee with refills. My daughter had blintzes (YUM!). Hubby had a cheese omelette, nicely done not too brown.  Then I spied that Carole's Cheesecake was offered on the menu! Score! Daughter and I added two mini cup cheesecakes to the breakfast feast! Everything was SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"If you're a member of Toronto's Jewish community, walking into United Bakers for weekend brunch is like walking into an episode of \"this is your life\". The restaurant is dotted with community mainstays, friends from high school or camp, and relatives you'd just rather avoid. Sandwiched tightly in green plastic booths, this is not a place where you can expect to have a private, quiet conversation. In fact, between the bustling bakery up front, and the servers trained by Oscar the Grouch, you can't really expect a quiet anything. 

But that's part of United's charm. United Bakers is a Dairy restaurant-the lactose-friendly answer to the old school Delicatessen. Out of respect for Jewish dietary laws, United's menu is limited to dairy, egg and fish-based meals. A polite notice on the website and menu requests that customers refrain from bringing meat on the premises. So if you're expecting bacon and eggs, you're out of luck. Don't worry-you won't miss the bacon. 

Ordering brunch presents a series of challenges. Egg platters are fine, but omelettes are more interesting. A mushroom version arrives with plenty of thinly-sliced fungi, while good cheddar leaks through the side of a cheese version. Lox, eggs and onions sees properly caramelized onions and chunks of fresh smoked salmon. It doesn't smell fishy, and the lox retains some of it's silky texture since it's not overcooked.  Sides include salad, tomato and cukes (the former still winter-mealy, the latter firm and crisp), and what may be the best undiscovered french fries in Toronto. I suspect they're frozen, but they are consistently crispy and golden outside, and fluffy inside. You also get a choice of bread or bagel. As I always say, GO BAGEL OR GO HOME. 

Lunch and dinner work best when you stick to the basics. Pastas and fish are OK, but most tables opt for a soup and a scoop. United's pea soup deserves it's reputation. Melty peas, chunky veg and the occasional noodle warm the soul. It's a richly flavored soup and a closely guarded secret recipe. I suspect the secret involves a veggie boullion cube, but it works. Bagel platters and sandwiches find their way to most tables along with plates of those fries.  The tuna melt stands out. Piping hot atop a massive twister bagel, it could be shared between two people, along with a cup of that soup. Greek salad deviates from the Platonic ideal, with iceberg lettuce and hardboiled egg but then, it's all buried under so much deliciously creamy feta cheese you probably won't notice. 

Coffee is fine when it's fresh,  barely drinkable when it's not. I try to time refill requests for when they brew a fresh pot. I'd ask politely if they'd put a new one on, but value the security of my person.  

It's a bakery, so the best desserts are whatever's fresh. I have a soft spot for the Dobush cake (dry sponge with light-chocolate frosting, enrobed in crackling dark chocolate) and the Apple Bowl (a hot, whole apple wrapped in puff pastry). 

United closes at 9 on weekends, but it's best not to tempt fate. A late night coffee and pastry stop sees our waitress ask repeatedly if she can pack our stale cinnamon buns to go. In another joint, I'd walk out and not return. Here, abuse is part of the fun."}
{"text":"There is no doubt United Bakers is a neighborhood institution and somewhat of a unique establishment in Toronto. 
I first checked out UB on Christmas day for brunch when no other place in town seemed to be open! Other than the large portions, the egg dishes were not extraordinary in any way, although I was quite impressed with the French fries (they were McD's style!) and the availability of honey dew! 
What I personally liked about UB besides the old school feel was the bakery counter. UB bakes THE best Challah bread I have had in Toronto by quite some distance. The density, texture and taste of the Challah has clearly been perfected over many years, I suggest you try it here.
Aside from the Challah, the rye bread was also fresh and tasty and the poppy seed danish (pictured) was out of this world! I will stay away from the donuts next time as they were a bit too greasy and not that special!
Other notes are that there is a quick turnaround and the wait time from brunch is not too bad, and I experienced decent service during my visit."}
{"text":"DATE OF MEAL CONSUMPTION:
Saturday, March 20

DATE OF MEAL DIGESTION:
Monday, March 22 (ongoing)

OK, I lied. It's Tuesday and I'm still digesting my Tuna Reuben (pictured). Apparently my stomach halved itself and I became some sort of python over the weekend, unable to swiftly break down food particles using mere stomach acid? I've never seen a larger sandwich. You know how most tuna melts have an ice cream scoop of tuna/mayo on them? This scoop must have been the size of a football helmet. It was immense and smothered in melted cheddar cheese. I barely made it through 50% of my poppy seed twister before tapping out. It was allegedly served with a salad though I couldn't bear to look past my own plate.

The menu is massive and you won't miss the lack of meat. There is (white)fish, cheese, eggs and Polish/Jewish/Eastern Euro fare galore. 
The latkes (called placki kartoflane where I come from) were outstanding, and thankfully my Babcia isn't around to hear me say that. They were served with sour cream (yes!), applesauce AND ketchup. Take your pick. On my next visit I'll stick to a plate of these.

The owner was milling around the restaurant chatting with families and making sure everybody was happy. It's been a while since I've seen this sort of hospitality in a restaurant. Either the owner is absent, counting money in the back room or lording over his/her employees. This owner was happy to be running the ship and proud to see so many smiling, sated faces. 

There are thousands of lively, shouting children here on weekends. Expect a bit of a wait, and come armed with earplugs and livestock tranquilizers."}
{"text":"You know what? It's tragic that I have to give this fine diner a 3 star rather than 5. This place is really wholesome and has a safe and comforting environment. However it looks shit, and while I see past that, I can't give credit when others try so hard to pinpoint their aesthetics. Classic western-American dishes, and I had a salad! It was lit."}
{"text":"I have a huge place in my heart for Jewish diners, especially dairy and fish ones. 

Until a dramatic and lengthy search for *diners serving all day breakfast open Sunday late afternoon* occurred, I had no idea this place existed. My husband also hearts Jewish diners, and since he lived a long time in LA he doesn't mind driving 20 minutes for lox. 

I had the pea soup, the eggs over easy and a bagel. It is all exactly as you'd expect, and is served to you as you sit on a plastic booth, the laminated menu is pages and pages exactly as your heart hopes it is, and you pay at the front where you can buy bagels to take home exactly as you imagine. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I came here yesterday with my friend for lunch. He just moved to the area and used to go to this place all the time with his grandparents when he was younger so he was excited to return! 

We got there and were greeted and seated quickly by the friendly hostess.

Our waitress came by a few times to see if we wanted drinks or food but we hadn't made any final decisions yet. I am always torn between at least two meals at restaurants and always ask my server which one they would recommend.

Well when I asked our waitress who's name was Felicia what she recommended- either the shakshuka or the egg salad platter, she looked at me like I committed a crime and said, well they're 2 completely different meals so...

And that was it. I kid you not. I felt so uncomfortable I just decided to get the shakshuka so she'd leave. Are you kidding me? Usually servers enjoy telling you what they like, and they may be different but does that mean you don't have a preference? Or for gods sake just name the more expensive one and call it a day!

A very nice waitress names Joey noticed my friend and I were kind of caught off guard and came over. She told me I made a good choice in ordering the shakshuka and even went and got us a sample of the pea soup after we told her we'd never tried it. She was so sweet and came back to our table a few times to see how we were doing. 

Our food came pretty quick and my friend and I both bet that Felicia wouldn't even come back to ask how it was. She didn't for a while but when she did she literally said \"how's everything\" and before we could even say \"good\" she had walked away and was already asking the lady at the table next to us. 

The food was amazing by the way! The shakshuka was so delicious and I had a bite of my friends fries and they were heavenly.

We both ran out of water towards the end of the meal and left the glasses very visible for Felicia to see but nonetheless had to ask her to fill them. She came over with one bill and when we told her it was actually separate she angrily walked away to fix it.

Finally my friend put her to the test and gave her the opportunity to apologize! He asked her if she was having a bad day because she wasn't very nice to us. She simply said, no I'm just working. That was the final straw, let's just say we called Joey over and gave her a well deserved tip.

Bye Felicia!"}
{"text":"Great selection of bagles. Good service. Bagle comes with sides, big portion, I sometimes take the other half of the bagle to- go. Ive only had lunch there, but would love to try breakfast."}
