{"text":"Can't say much bad about my \"goto\" place for Chinese food. This food reminded me of my childhood days, and will probably keep me coming back. Fast service, hot, and tasty.  My only tip is, don't order the lemon shrimp! It's 90% batter, with a measly piece of shrimp inside. Also, their 1 wedge of lemon for that entire selection was a joke."}
{"text":"Best take out chinese food in Newmarket. I have lived here my entire life and its been amazing since I was a kid. Wouldn't go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in Newmarket.  Always great staff! The way they interact with young children giving $ on behalf of the parents is really cute. \"You're treating them huh? So nice of you\". Have to agree tho, too much batter one the chicken balls."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from this restaurant and overall the experience was positive.  Food arrived in about 45 mins which is what I was promised.  When it arrived food was hot and taste was very good!  Think I found my go to spot for Chinese in Newmarket!"}
{"text":"So this has always been my go-to spot for chinese take out, im not a fan of chinese take out but since my wife is very much so, I need to grab it every so often.   Because of my lack of desire for this type of food though I figured i would use Yelp to hunt down alternate places to try, thusly switching my lack of desire because i found a hidden gem or somthing widely praised as being \"the best\"  Check it out though, as I tried a number of places in my searches my discovery was this.... I had already started at what I enjoyed the most. No matter where else i went or what other dishes i tried, nothing was close to being better then Four Seasons. Then i started ordering a different dish for myself to try each time i re ordered from there to discover that the humble spring roll they had at Four Seasons was absolutely fantastic, even other basic things like pork fried rice, sweet and sour chicken balls were better then the other places ive tried for take out. So i give it the full 5 stars because the service is nice, everything you order is usually ready for pick up in a short amount of time, and this is the best place ive ever gotten chinese take out from. So do it !"}
{"text":"I've lived in Newmarket almost my entire life. This is THE SPOT. You can go ahead and try other places but it's not going to be the same. Located on Main St., Newmarket it is a small takeout place no room to sit and eat. They have a bunch of great people that work there they always looks super happy.  My favourite foods to order from there are:  Special Fried Rice Shrimp and Lobster Sauce CHICKEN WINGS - will always be one of my faves  Did you have lunch specials as well if I find the picture I'm definitely going to post to that. They do delivery which is a great feature. The only downfall is they open up later so around 2 o'clock but there's so much busier at night so I get it. Definitely an establishment order from if you're in the area."}
