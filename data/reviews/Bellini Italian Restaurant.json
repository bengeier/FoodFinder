{"text":"My girlfriend and I recently tried this restaurant. I really enjoyed the converted church thing, especially when we realized the booth we were sitting in has been pews in a former life. The stained glass windows created a fun atmosphere since it's summer and the sun was up while we were eating. The food was also very good, usually I'm not such a big fan of going out for Italian food, I find that it's not \"exotic\" enough for me to bother with when I'm going out to eat. However as I said I was impressed with my meal and the service was also very pleasant, we were seated right away and the server managed to balance checking up on us without being a nuisance."}
{"text":"Very understaffed. Saturday night dinner rush, but took 7 minutes to even be greeted. Seated next to the door with a very cold breeze. Poor service and servers look over committed. 40 minutes to get appetizer, then bill and dessert dropped off during main course, and we felt somewhat rushed. Food was decent though mediocre. Cute architecture but doesn't seem worth the trouble."}
{"text":"We recently had our marriage (ceremony + reception) at Bellini and very enthusiastically recommend it as a fantastic venue for an event of any size or even just a dinner out.  The food is delicious and the staff goes above and beyond to provide excellent service.  Bellini is family owned and every member of the family is involved in organizing events and ensuring everything is to your liking. Our guests are still raving about the food and the attentiveness of the servers and bartenders.  Moreover, the restaurant is already so beautifully decorated that we provided hardly any extra decorations (really just flowers and some photos).  Thank you so much to everyone at Bellini (especially Angelina, wedding planner extraordinaire) for making our day so special and for making our food SO tasty and memorable."}
{"text":"The food was not out of this world, or incredibly original, but it was solid. The old-timey atmosphere was great, and the service was outstanding. We had a wonderful date night."}
{"text":"This is my all time favorite restaurant!! We had our wedding here and it was absolutely amazing.  Not only was the atmosphere perfect, the staff was professional, friendly, and helpful.  Our guests raved about the food stating that is was \"the best wedding food ever!\"      Since our wedding my husband and I go to  Bellini for all our special occasions and just for a night out.  I love the calamari!! It is simply amazing.  I also love the pasta dishes.  My favorite is the Gamberi Diavola.  It is pasta with shrimp in a spicy vodka cream sauce.  I love it!!!  I also love their desserts, they are home made and delicious.       I really can't believe anyone would ever say a negative thing about Bellini.  I have been there at least a dozen times and have never had a bad experience.  If you have never tried Bellini you are missing out.  Trust me, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I would recommend eating here if you want authentic Italian food. The old church is beautiful inside and the staff is nice and attentive. The bruschetta was very good and crispy but I probably did not need it because we also got warm bread with our meal. I had the alfredo primavera and it was delicious. The food tasted as good as it looked. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Bellini is a renovated church, setting the stage for a unique dining experience.  I took my wife here for a romantic dinner last Saturday night, and we both loved the atmosphere.  The meal began with the usual bread and seasoned olive oil, which was nothing special.  For our main courses, I ordered the lasagna and my wife ordered the ravioli.  Both dishes were proceeded with our choice of salad.  We both ordered the house Caesar salad, which did not disappoint.   We both thoroughly enjoyed our entrees.  My only complaint is that the tomato sauce on my lasagna was a bit too thin.  Overall the service was excellent.  Our water glasses were always full throughout the meal and the waiter was very attentive.  I would recommend Bellini for a romantic date night dinner."}
{"text":"* Ability to accommodate a large group (10 people): Excellent- The server got the order for drinks, appetizers, main course, and dessert without any mistakes. He was courteous, knowledgeable, and attentive.  * Food: SALTY, even after I requested no additional salt be added. I couldn't finish my meal because it was that salty.  * Price: Too high. Could get better food at lower prices around the Capitol area."}
{"text":"I love this place. Delicious food in a beautiful setting. Phenomenal staff and I love the owners. The restaurant has been in the same Sicilian family since 1980 in one form or another."}
{"text":"This place sucks.  We sat down and waited over 20 minutes for drinks, and even after complaining, nothing was comped. The food, while tasty, made me sick late in the night.  I'll never visit this dump again."}
{"text":"While I had high hopes for this place with the online imagery and upscale pricing, I am disappointed to say the food and service on this particular occasion was sub-par.  I have lived in Madison for 20 years, eaten at nearly every Italian restaurant over the years (except this one), and thought I'd give it a try with my wife.  The coffee we ordered was cold, and it took 20 minutes to get our waitress' attention to get it refilled (Note:  There were literally three other tables occupied on this particular Thursday evening at Bellini, so it wasn't slow service due to a dinner rush).  I want to note, however, that our second cup was much better.  Anyway, onto the food.  The garlic bread florentine was quite good...but that is where our satisfaction stopped.  My wife got the fettuccini giovanni, and the white wine cream sauce was like eating processed cheese sauce over noodles-heavy, salty and overbearing.  The sausage was cold in the centers and had an off-taste to it as well.  Furthermore, the presentation with the prosciutto was as if the cook simply threw a couple of slices randomly into the dish along with a handful of hot-dog cut sausage circles-nothing even close to the well-presented pictures posted on their website.  My dish, the pollo parmigiana, was unimpressive, with the fettuccini noodles being tough and in a terribly watery marinara sauce base that simply flowed off the noodle through your fork, leaving plain noodles per bite.  The chicken breasts were flavorful and well-prepared, though.  Now, this was our first visit, and I hope we simply caught them on a bad day, so I am giving them 2 stars rather than 1 in case this is the reason for such a disappointing meal not worth the $18/plate it cost."}
{"text":"I'm writing this because I find the negative comments in other reviews incredulous. My wife and I have had the pleasure of dinning at Bellini's several times over the past five years. (We go there to celebrate all significant events --e.g., birthdays, anniversaries, etc.). The converted chapel atmosphere is both comfortable and serene. There is always someone who greets you in a warm, friendly manner that projects an I'm-glad-you're-hear attitude. Nice! The waitstaff are always attentive and accommodating and project a genuineness that we seldom encounter elsewhere. The food is moderately priced for an upscale establishment such as this and the quality is unexcelled. (I'm salivating thinking of the remarkable dishes we always enjoy.) Portions are more than generous. (We have yet to leave without first requesting a container for our uneaten food.)  Additionally, Bellini is the first restaurant we mention and the only one we unconditionally recommend  whenever we're asked. If you enjoy Italian food, a pleasant environment, fair prices, great service and an exceptional dining experience, this is your place. As my wife recently remarked to a friend, \"the best of the best\"."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a wonderful meal at Bellini.   The service was great and made our time there memorable!  Wonderful people we will try and get back there on our next visit to Madison."}
{"text":"This place is a rip-off.  They charge high prices for low quality small portions.  I like the restaurant for the church ambience."}
{"text":"The staff was welcoming and nice enough but the food was sub-par for Madison.  Madison has such wonderful Italian restaurants and this one was more expensive and far inferior in taste.  I got the garlic shrimp which was way too overpowering and tasted like the garlic was all raw.  The mashed potatoes were grey and lumpy.  The shrimp was cooked alright but no imagination was used to prepare them.  My husband got the manicotti which was bland and unappetizing.  The sauce tasted like something out of a can.  If you want good Italian food, try Greenbush or Lombardino's: both have larger portions, more authentic flavors, and  more pride put iinto the food preparation.  We will not be going back."}
{"text":"The dishes were dirty. You could see the food and the old food floating around in your cup of water. And all over your plates. When we asked for new plates they were still dirty, and same with the cups. Their dishwasher apparently isn't working. Our waitress was never around and we got a table cold in the corner. The food was good but an awful presentation."}
{"text":"Very unique setting in an old converted church. While our waiter was self-admittedly inexperienced, he did try hard and was very polite. The few hiccups were easily overlooked (3 glasses of wine may have helped).   Two of us had lasagna and the other had the chicken parm. All were very pleased and we had plenty of leftovers due to the generous portion sizes.   Looks like the bar has some OK happy hour specials and could also be a nice change of pace for a first stop of the night sometime.   I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"The most striking thing about this establishment is the decor, established in an old church, Bellini's has a small main dining area and bar in an old chapel, stained glass, gargoyles (painted) and high-backed chairs (with wheels!).  has a pretty decent selection of classic Italian food, classic dishes that, if I try to pronounce them, would probably get me a yelling from Giada or Batali. We got the Fritto appetizers, Mozzarella and Calamari. The mozzarella was good though it had a very quick half-life (eat it while it's still hot) but the calamari was passable. There were pretty large clumps of it and the breading was just a bit soggy.  Entrees were better, we shared an order of the veal and a pizza. The veal was tender, the sauce was good, the prosciutto was salty and balanced out the rich, creamy mashed potatoes. The deep dish pizza was rich, thick and doughy.  The tiramisu was for dessert and boy was it good! Light and fluffy, sweet and flavorful, finishing off the meal on a high note. Overall, pretty good, I'd give it another shot."}
{"text":"We were excited about the interesting atmosphere, and while the service was fine, the food was horrible. For Valentine's weekend, one meal we ordered was dry and overcooked and other meal (the daily special) came out lukewarm, sticky, and overdone. Spend your romantic evening elsewhere!"}
{"text":"The ambience of the place is spot on. There ends the hype regarding the place. The servers were very friendly. The food is very good. But it is nothing special. I have had better Italian food at other places. The pizza and the pasta was nothing special. The chicken parmigiana was sort of ok. But considering the hype the food is nothing special."}
{"text":"Had dinner at Bellini last week with my buddy and his girlfriend.  I probably go to Bellini about four times a year, and have been coming here for 30+ years, ever since it was called The Monestary.   I've always found the food to be reliably good and sometimes excellent.  On this night, I had the Tortellini Bolognese, which is a particular favorite of mine. It was very good. (I read that Enzio Ferarri used to have tortellini bolognese and a glass of lambrusco almost every day for lunch).  My buddy had Pollo Alfredo, pasta and grilled chicken breast in alfredo sauce. They used to have a version of this that had pesto in the sauce that was very good.  The girlfriend had Cavatappi Salciccia, which is cavatappi pasta and sausage in a spicy marinara sauce. It was too spicy for her taste, although I tried some and I thought it was OUTSTANDING, and I plan to order it the next time I'm there for dinner.  I enjoy their bar for a quiet drink. I've always liked the atmosphere there."}
{"text":"Where to start? This place is dismal. In a land of amazing restaurants in downtown Madison, I am amazed Bellini can stay in business. I've been there twice in the last two months for work dinners and had terrible service and disgusting food. Our large group was one of three tables in the restaurant on a Tuesday night.  We ordered a few appetizers. The calamari was rubbery and cold. The bruschetta was slimy and odd. The garlic bread with cheese wasn't bad! It took nearly two hours for our entrees to arrive.  When they arrived, most were cold and a few were served the wrong dishes.  I'd rank the entrees as slightly below Olive Garden quality.  Our food was served by the bartender, which was really strange.  Our waitresses were never to be seen. We were never checked on and weren't offered refills on our drinks.  They frankly lost out on a lot of money on drinks by neglecting our table.  I had to go to the bar to ask for another glass of water.   Icing on the cake: A few of us at the table got sick from the food the next day.   Do yourself a favor and go to any restaurant but this one! There are SO many amazing restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Unique dining experience! Warm homemade bread! Food mediocre....$30 steak was mushy and came with fries...fresh pasta was very good but still overpriced....appetizer looked like McDonald's tried to simply fancy up their chicken fingers."}
{"text":"We went here for the first time over the weekend for my boyfriends birthday.  It was a really neat venue!  Everything was great, food was great, waitress was great, atmosphere was great.  We were happy we picked Bellini.  The only reason I'm not giving it 5-stars is because I felt it was a little pricey.  We both said we'd love to go back and try some of the other menu items but the prices may keep us from returning soon.  I do recommend to  give this place a try for something different."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, the first time for steak and the second time for their Friday fish fry. The steak I'd give a 4 -- perfectly done, and with an excellent sauce. As for the fish fry...let's just say you'd be better off going somewhere else. It's essentially 3 over-salted fish sticks, with a collection of ho-hum garlicky fried potatoes on the side. I'd have to give it a two."}
{"text":"I hate to be a downer, but as a person in the market for an Italian rehearsal dinner locale, I had high hopes on Bellini. The idea of it being set in an old church sounded cool, and it does have some ambiance in the main dining area, with the stained glass and whatnot. Too bad the private room is in the basement by the restrooms in a very non-Church-like setting. More importantly, the food was definitely sub-par for this bride-to-be. First, the portions were rather small. My fiance's pasta dish only had about 5 forkfuls of noodles. I ordered the salmon, which came with \"mashed potatoes\"...now if these were \"mashed potatoes,\" they would make your mother's lumpy attempts or boxed instants look like rockstars. These were gray, heavy, and lumpy to boot. Also, the whole dish came swimming in a bowl of sauce. Needless to say, never again for me!"}
{"text":"Went here last night for Fancy Date night with my man. Good food + cool Decor= great date night destination.  From the outside it's almost hard to see that there is a restaurant in this building, I must have passed it 100's of times going up East Washington without noticing it. The restaurant is very classy and unique and although (like most places in madison) fancy clothes aren't required it's a great place to go if you do want to dress up.   It was our server's first night so she was being shadowed by someone who had worked there longer. They were both very nice and we got water as soon as we sat down, warm bread with olive oil soon followed. My date ordered a pizza and I had the Fettucini Angelina with the shrimp on the side. My dinner came with a salad, which had the best crutons I have ever had. The rest of the salad was run of the mill. The fettucini was fantastic (although a little heavier than I had expected) it was tossed with cream sauce spinach and portabella mushrooms. I got the shrimp on the side since I don't eat shellfish but my date does, he dipped it in my pasta sauce and said it was amazing. My only wish would be that the pasta was made on site (fresh pasta as opposed to dried and then cooked pasta).  However, it was cooked to perfection and didn't detract from the dish.   My date's pizza was sausage and mushroom. It tasted really good. The crust was more like a thin deep dish pizza than a true italian pizza. He really enjoyed it but said he'd go for the pasta next time.  The whole thing was pricey but it was a top notch experience. If it had been a little cheaper I'd easily give this place 5 stars..."}
{"text":"This review is just for the bar and staff experience along with the decor. According to the bar tender this church was converted to a bar / restaurant in the 40s or 50s and has been operating ever since. There is lounge / live music venue space in the basement with pews as seating that opens at various times according to the bar tender. The place uses little real lights and let's the light from the stain glass windows set the lighting before its gets dark with the help of candles every where. The interior is very cool and I totally love the theme of this awesome place. The interior is beautiful with its open space foot print and high ceilings but don't look too close at the ceilings because the look very dumpy compared to the rest of the decor. The bar was nice with some silly over hang piece in the center which I didn't understand, it must be a church thing. The bar tender was a nice and talked to us about the property and its history. The place is very cool and not very full around 7pm on a Saturday with tons of staff on hand like a swarm was about to happen or just over staffed. This is defiantly a must stop in Maddison wi and I will post pictures of this cool place. The bar hop must include a mix of divy and nice and this place is nice. Three straight and one mixed was not as much as I though for the coolness of this place. The food is Italian on the menu and there is a good drink menu to match. I would recommend this stop while in Maddison Wi."}
{"text":"First time coming here snd was not disappointed. The interior is beautiful from an old church. The side salads were very flavorful. The bread was very fresh and was perfect-soft on the inside and a little crispy on the outside. We got the ravioli entree dish to split as an appetizer-a little over priced for the portion but homemade and really good. I got the tortellini Maria split and it was homemade and the sauce was perfect with it-split was a good sized portion. The pesto was also really good and huge portion-good for people that want to split a meal.  Our service was on top of everything and friendly."}
{"text":"My wife has wanted to eat at the Bellini for a long time and finally with friends in town and us going downtown anyway we decided to try it.    Walking in to the old church converted to a restaurant was cool.  The place was decorated well and had some great old tables and chairs.  heck, even the booths looked like they were made from the old church pews. Upon arrival our friends were waiting at the bar for us as we were about 5 minutes late (my brother in-law decided to show up late for his surprise birthday party)  and were seated immediately.  This next song is called \"Waiting\". (look up Stephen Lynch \"Waiting\" if you never heard it).  We waited forever for our drink orders to be taken and we really needed this dinner not to be a long dragged out affair.  We had tickets for the comedy club and did not want to be late.  So we waited and waited and finally we flagged down our waitress for drink orders.  After the drinks arrived we waited again.  Finally we ordered our appetizers and the waiting game began again to order our entrees.  After about 15 minutes and myself looking at my watch a whole bunch we got our appetizers and ordered our entrees.   The appetizers were good.  We ordered the caprese salad and it was good except it lacked the Balsamic Vinegar.  We finally asked for this and they brought it to us to add outselves.  Now the salads that came with everybody's meals was a different story.  3 our of the 7 of us had some sort of sand or grit in their salads as if the lettuce had not been washed.   I even sampled their salads and yes...it felt like somebody kicked sand in my mouth from the beach.  Finally the entrees came out and I am not a huge pasta lover so I ordered the pizza and it was VERY good.  I was a bit surprise on this and enjoyed my pizza very much.  Was it is best ever...nah but it could be in the top 15 on my list.   But overall everyone in our ground enjoyed their meals and it was good.  LET THE WAITING GAME BEGIN AGAIN!  We finished out meals and just sat and waited for our checks.  Wait, wait, wait, and finally a friend of mine grabs the waitress and asked for the check as we were already late for our show.  Ultimately the dinner took about 30 minutes longer than what we had thought and could have easily been resolved with better service and a more attentive wait staff.  So the food was good and the service sucked.  I would go back to the Belinni as it was good but should remember that it will take all night and we should not have other plans.    On a side note:  They should have some sort of sign exiting the building to \"watch you step\" as I missed a little step immediately out their door and almost fell down the additional steps."}
{"text":"So my family and I went here to celebrate my brother's graduation, and my mom had a kinnepshit: at the restaurant, my family and I were placed in the dreary basement with a half-assed, artsy paint job and fake vines. Meanwhile, the prom kids got to sit up in the nicer, top floor, high ceilinged dining room. Well, she didn't find the humor in this but I did. Maybe they just made the reservations like a half a year in advance...?  Okay, so this place was an old church converted into a restaurant. So the decor needed a major rehaul so it didn't feel like it was converted from said house of prayer the night before. It had mediocre tortellini in a cream sauce and breaded cheese artichokes that didn't have enough carbs on them in my opinion. At least the server tried hard and tried his best to be accomodating to a table of like, 12! :)"}
{"text":"Catholic church pews are prized by the diocese specifically to ensure the discomfort of sinful, repentant peasants .... these do not make for good restaurant seating. The food was tasty but when they ask... don't say you want a booth."}
{"text":"Food is absolutely incredible. While somewhat expensive, I feel it was completely worth what I paid. Taking it in inside the romantic and opulent atmosphere of a 100-year-old church might have even been the best part of the experience.  The bruschetta was topped with incredibly fresh tomatoes that were a little sweet like a real tomato should be, despite the fact that they were out of season. This may have been attributable to the vinaigrette, which was also incredibly well-done. It's my opinion that a good bruschetta speaks to the quality of an Italian restaurant, because the dish is only as good as the sum of its individual parts.  I'd definitely recommend the ravioli, which was some of the best I've ever had. Perfect consistency inside and out, a flavorful blend of seasonings - making something like that takes talent.  Highly recommended for a special occasion or if you're filthy rich."}
{"text":"We tried Bellini last weekend and had a wonderful experience.  The setting is very unique. The restaurant is located in what was originally a church. Stained glass windows, vaulted archways, soaring ceilings, heavy wooden chairs and tables all trace back to it origins.   We were greeted at the hostess stand and ushered to a booth. It was a little tight sliding into the booth around the legs of the table but once seated it was very comfortable. There are a few lights on the walls and they lit a candle at the table. It's a romantic setting but it makes it hard to read the menu. (You may have to use your phone as a flashlight.)   Our waitress was friendly and knowledgeable. She brought us bread and dipping oil and took our drink orders. The bread had a great crust and hearty texture. I thought the oil was particularly tasty, perhaps it was infused.  For dinner we had the fettuccine which was tossed with Italian sausage and proscuitto in white wine cream sauce and the rigatoni piccoli which was tossed with Italian sausage, meatballs and marinara sauce. One thing that really stood out for me was that the amount of sauce on each dish was perfect. Usually pasta is either swimming in sauce or I'm wishing there was more to coat each piece of pasta. This was exactly the right amount and all of the flavors were perfect. The texture of the pasta was spot-on and the spices in the sausage and meatballs were amazing. At the end of our meal we were full but not bloated.  After our meal, about the time we were just starting to wonder if our waitress might have forgotten us, she appeared, apologized profusely for not having been there earlier and told us she was comping our drinks. We hadn't even said anything but were amazed by this level of consideration.  For the atmosphere, the amazing food, and the thoughtfulness of our waitress, I have to give Bellini's the best rating and highly recommend it. We will definitely return when we want Italian food."}
{"text":"so after a little internet searching i decided to take the wife here for dinner for her bday wknd getaway to madison. i really liked the idea of a former church being turned into a restaurant and i was dead on with my choice. as usual we were running late and the restaurant was extra nice in pushing back our reservation for us. when we arrived the hostess took a little while tom come and greet us but it didn't bother us since we had the chance to snap a few pics and she even offered to take one for us.  the place was decorated nicely, stained glass windows and even had the pews staying behind as booths. we started out with a glass of wine and i had the chicken special in a white sauce that came withe mashed potatoes while the wife as a true carnivore had the steak dinner. both of us really enjoyed our meals and while i can't say that they were amazing, they were pretty good and we didn't have any complaints.  the lighting was really nice and romantic and i would say it was a perfect choice if you're looking for a good place for a date. as you walk out you have a good few of the capitol at night which is awesome if you make it out around sunset. overall, it was a really solid meal with good service. i'd def go back if i'm ever in madison again."}
{"text":"I hope to come back--the food was great, and the pasta sauce delicious. The ambiance is also very unique set in an old church."}
{"text":"Great place, First, the atmosphere and decor was very unique, being an old church. Service was outstanding. We had an ex-theater person as a waitress and she was not only excellent at her job but very demonstrative and entertaining, a pleasure to  be around. Wine was reasonably priced. Food was excellent and in very large portions so you sure went away satisfied. Other reviewers spoke of long waits but we experienced nothing of the sort. Overall excellent, would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"If cream sauces were wall paint, Bellini would be selling a lot of beige.  After one of their cream sauce inundated meals, the poor quality of the sauce was surpassed only by the thin, pallid Brakebush chicken breast we found buried within.  Seriously, their food is Italian Americanized on steroids.  Try to find spaghetti and meatballs at an Italian restaurant in Italy.  To better these meatballs, go to Fazoli's.  To summarize our experience, come for the promise, leave for the food.  Grazie!"}
{"text":"My best friend held her rehearsal dinner in the downstairs area and it was fabulous!  The space was very warm and inviting and accommodated a group of 35-40 guests well.  The bartenders kept the drinks flowing (New Glarus beer on tap--wooo!) and were super friendly.    The food was delicious--spinach/artichoke dip was fan-freaking-tastic!  I limited myself to a small amount though, because next up was pizza.  Mmm...the plain cheese was probably my favorite, even though it sounds boring, it wasn't.  It had a pleasant amount of garlic to kick it up a notch.  I didn't do any dessert, but the tiramisu looked pretty tasty.  I'm definitely coming here on my next visit to Madison!"}
{"text":"Arrived for a 5:30 PM dinner on a Tuesday nite.  Hostess and waitress were friendly, but not forward.  I had a yummy tomato bisque and a salad.  Others had mannicotti, pasta with chicken and basil, and pasta alla giovanni.  Everyone loved their entrees, served with salad and bread.  We skipped dessert and opted for cappacinos which were great.  Love the church building and the decorations.  Will go back."}
{"text":"I've driven past this place countless times and always wondered how it was. Heck anything stuck in an old church sounds cool. So when I was flipping through the pages of my entertainment book the other evening I seen Bellini and thought now would be the perfect time to try it out. So I talked with my fiancee and we agreed it's worth a try.  I call a day in advance to make reservations which weren't needed judging how quiet it was this evening. We looked over the menu and I ordered the Tortellini alla Maria, it was delicious and recommend by our server. She said it's the most popular dish. My fiancee ordered the Pollo e GamberiI alla Pietro. She loved it and I loved mine. Each came with a salad. I was expecting small portions that other yelpers mentioned but these plates were by no means small.   I gave it 3 stars because our server was pretty darn nice, she could have been a bit more personable though. The food while good is definitely not worth $23 a plate. (I had a coupon).   So if your looking for some great food head here. The interior is pretty and they had really dim lights, with candles. I have to say it's very romantic. Make sure you dress nice, and guys that means your Dockers too!  PS leave the kids at home, this is a nice quiet place."}
{"text":"Visited on Wednesday night that turned out to be a Concert on the Square night.  Parking was a bit of a hassle.  We (Mrs. & Mr.) used a Bucky Book coupon that advised us to call and make a reservation.  We made one for 7:30.  We arrived on time and the place was nearly empty.  The hostess just seated us without asking if we had a reservation ( there was really no need for one as there was plenty of empty tables).  We chose a booth over a table and discovered the booth was very tight to get into and out of.  The benches are too close to the table and the table support leg is very wide making it difficult to slide in/get out of your seat.  Not a big deal, but if you're older like us, you would be best advised to pick a table.  Our server was kind in greeting us, but did not ask if we wanted any drinks until her second visit.  No big deal, but we both commented that we usually get asked that question when we are first seated.  We just had water with our meals.  We ordered two pasta dishes per Bucky Book coupon plus an appetizer.  Appetizer was the mozzarella  garlic bread which was very good, BUT it took forever to get it.  Our server apologized 3 times (we did not inquire, rather she offered the apologies on her own) and the final time she said it'll be out in 2 minutes - it took 5.  We heard anther waitress apologize to another table about their long wait too.  Service was friendly but SLOW.  Our meals were very late in arriving.  Mrs. had the the ravioli with the creamy tomato sauce with spinach and mushrooms.  Mr. had the manicotti.  I will say that we both had made our mind that we would not be returning to this restaurant because of the very slow service; however our meals were really good plus we got a very nice discount (BOGO) on our pasta meals.  We might go back with a coupon."}
{"text":"It's a shame, I was really looking forward try this restaurant ... We walked in and place seemed crowded... They were clearly understaffed...  here is how it went ... waiter #1 came gave us 1 special for the night and then asked what we wanted, besides water, by the time we look up he was already gone .. WTF  ... minus one star right there, we asked another guy walking around if we could order, he said he said he doesn't take the orders but he can try to help us with drinks( minus another star), luckily another waitress overheard and decided to come help us .. which was nice, she was helpful and gave us 4 specials for that night (I think her name was Jennifer - plus one star) .. She was kinda on top of everything and super peppy which was good, she forgot our balsamic vinegar and one of my pizza's but I didn't mind much because she was so damn nice ... the food kinda sucked .. the bruschetta had too much mozzarella .. the last time I checked, it was just a Parmesan or a hard cheese ..  the pasta was kinda bland, and didn't have enough salt... the pizza was extremely cheesy...  (minus one star) Everything was a bit pricey ... with the prices I would have expected the food to be superb .. save your time and go to Lombordino's ... I really wanted to  like this place I really did, but I think they need to change things up"}
{"text":"My partner chose Bellini's for a carb-filled dinner the night before our first 10k run together. He made the reservations and we were seated immediately.  Based on the recommendation from the waitress my partner ordered the ravioli and I ordered the Salmon special.  The salmon special was served with an amaretto sauce atop artichoke hearts and a side of mashed potatoes. The amaretto sauce, I felt, didn't work with the salmon as it was a bit too sweet. It wasn't a menu item and I won't order it again (the mashed potato side was peppery and delicious).  The ravioli was the better meal. It was so good I wanted to sop up his sauce with the bread.  I'll definitely go back.  The lighting in the renovated church lent great ambience and character to a good, solid meal that was worth the 100$"}
{"text":"Just back from dinner, very good food and our server, Samantha was excellent. Nice and quiet for conversation"}
{"text":"Without a doubt the most disappointing restaurant I've ever eaten at in Madison (and I've lived here for 20 years and have eaten at ALOT of places in/around town).  Went with a small group for dinner and while the atmosphere is cool (who doesn't love a pretty old church?) - the service and the food was not.  We obviously had someone very new to both waitstaffing and Bellini as she barely knew the menu and her table service was weird - reaching in between people, fingers stuck in our food as she put plates down, etc.  The food was so so so so bad that we all left most of our orders untouched - just super mediocre, oddly flavored, cheapy Italian food.  I can honestly say that Bellini has nothing on Olive Garden (sad but true)!  My husband ordered the veal parmesan - less than 2 hours later he was throwing up in the basement bathroom.  We're talking about a 6'2, 200lb man who can eat unbelievably impressive amounts/types of food without issue, puking his guts out in a restaurant men's room because of \"god only knows what was in the veal.\"  Never happened before that night, hasn't happened since. :(  Needless to say, our evening at Bellini sucked.  It's such a cool venue but the food is so bad, I honestly don't understand how it stays open.  Hate to think that tourists/out-of-towners are eating here and using it as a gauge of Madison's restaurant scene :("}
{"text":"Three of us had a fantastic dinner last night at Bellini.  My wife and I brought our former exchange student who's back for a visit, and she really likes Italian food.  She had a chicken pesto pasta dish, and my wife and I each had seafood pastas with a white wine & light cream sauce - mine with shrimp & clams, hers with shrimp, clams, and mussels.  We all loved our meals, and the seafood is some of the best I've had including on the coasts.  The calamari appetizer was also excellent.  Service was top-notch, making it really one of the nicest meals we've had in quite a while."}
{"text":"Excellent service, food and atmosphere.  We each had the Lasagna, and loved every bite.  Preceded by bread and fresh garden salad, the portions were perfectly sized.  We'll go back for the Tuesday night \"buy one get one\" pizza special."}
{"text":"Ugh, I wanted so badly to like this place. The food looked outstanding but it was so, so salty. I could not finish my plate even though I was still very hungry. I ordered the sausage and meatballs while my mom ordered the lasagna. Not only was my dish extremely salty, but my mom dish was as well. There was one good dish at the table, however. The salmon had no complaints of saltiness. Unfortunately, that wasn't my dish so I was left to try and fish for anything on my plate that didn't taste like it was soaked in salt. As for the service, it was good. Id give it 4 stars. We had a nice waitress. Although she did forget sugar on the iced tea and it did take a while to get her attention.. she was very kind/friendly.  All in all, sad to say I wont be coming again."}
{"text":"I wanted to so badly like this place, the idea of a church being converted into a restaurant is really cool, but it just missed the mark. My partner and I went for the dinner for 2 deal. The deal itself was good and the menu for it had appealing options. We ordered fried mozzarella, it was mediocre the cheese used was just kind of ordinary. And since this is an Italian place I was expecting some great moz. I ordered the Caesar salad with salmon and my date had pasta and meatballs. My ceasar was decent but no hard-boiled eggs and the salmon on it was terrible. No seasoning and just didn't seem like a quality piece of fish. My dates was extremely salty and also a little bland. It was such a disappointing dinner, we will not be back."}
{"text":"I walked in to what still felt a lot like a church; pretty unique atmosphere. We were sat at a booth which im pretty sure was made from old pews.  We were served hot bread with olive oil and herbs. I love bread and olive oil, so this was great. We got bacon-wrapped shrimp as an appetizer. If you get upset when you are served small portions, steer clear of this. While it was good and perfectly cooked, you only get 4 shrimp for $15.  I got the chicken parmesan. The chicken was maybe a tad dry and not very crispy, but i think this was a good textural pairing with the tomato sauce. The fettuccine noodles were slightly al dente, and the parmesan balanced out the delicately sweet tomato sauce. I really enjoyed it!  I also got to try the seafood manicotti. This was awesome! If you like shrimp, ricotta, cream sauces, and tomatoes, look no further!  I would love to come back! This was a fun dinner."}
{"text":"Met up with a few other out-of-towners here for a work dinner; the hubs and I arrived a bit early and sat down at the bar for a drink.   Now, I'm all for cheap drinks and happy hour, so the $3 glass of house wine was really up my alley. I got a bad vibe when the bartender pulled the red wine out of the fridge--and it was rightly felt. Hubs called it the worst glass of wine he's ever had. The white was slightly better, but I'd still rather pay full price for a decent glass of wine than $3 for...not a good glass.   Our dinner friends arrived, so we moved from the bar to a table. Our server was excellent (too bad he said it was his last night there). He did a fantastic job of educating one of our table-mates on the gluten-free options available (answer: several--even the meatballs are gluten free!). He made sure we were well fed and beveraged. One ding for forgetting our cheese bread appetizer. Permanently. I didn't take care of the bill, but I hope we weren't charged for it.   I ordered the chicken fettuccini alfredo, and the sauce and pasta were pretty tasty--nicely cooked, flavorful sauce, not too watery. It was the chicken that was the problem, which tasted as though it had been poached, refrigerated, and then microwaved before serving. If they had take that same chicken breast and grilled it, the dish would have moved from okay to excellent. The rest of the table were fairly happy with theirs, though it was commented that things were a bit salty.   The other issue, besides the terrible wine, was the ambiance. Yes, the place is gorgeous. Beautiful stained glass windows, and they've really done a nice job of adding restaurant features without taking too much away from the church atmosphere. But it was empty. Dinner on a night where the city is swarmed with visitors and we were the only table. It just makes you feel awkward. The chairs are on casters. There's just something about having a nice dinner with the gentle hum of a full restaurant that really sets a mood.   The opposite goes for an empty one."}
{"text":"We just had our wedding here. The ambience is just perfect for a wedding.  It went super smooth and they helped us plan everything so it went super smooth.  After the wedding we had multiple people tell us it was an amazing wedding and a person who used to work weddings said it was the best wedding he's ever attended.  Perfect place for a wedding."}
{"text":"I never was a fan and thus have not been here in years but we gave it another try because we had a great coupon. As in the past we found it consistently mediocre. Everything was fine, nothing gross but nothing memorable either. Roasted Vegetable soup, bruchetta, some pasta dish I already forgot. The cheesecake was probably the worst in memory.  ...but the tap beer selection is good."}
{"text":"Fetuccini was pretty good. it is an old church comverted to a restaurant. Lighting could be improved."}
{"text":"Decided to write because I haven't been back in a while but planned on heading over for dinner.   The reason I'm returning: the food is flavorful.  I don't care for the small booths and chairs on caster rollers but even the most basic spaghetti and meatballs (then partner had) was good. I had chicken alfredo and loved it all - including our left overs. Plan on getting the steak this time.   Sorority sister recommends their dessert but I'm allergic to most things made with eggs & milk (e.g. cake/cookies). Appreciate the deals offered - hate they're not open for lunch as I'd visit more often."}
{"text":"My wife and I were completely blown away by this place.  We split a bowl of fetuccini and small spinich pesto pizza and couldn't have been happier with our choices and the staff.  It's tough to find Italian food that dazzles me, but I can say 100% that Bellini's did!"}
{"text":"I came here with a deal and I was excited about dining in the gorgeous old church.  The chicken parm was really off. The noodles were slippery and Newman's jarred sauces are better. The salad was soaked with dressing. I wasn't impressed by the tiramisu.  So yes come here if you want a pretty ambiance and a nice server. Don't come here if you want food that you'll enjoy eating."}
{"text":"I love this place...and I suppose I still do. I had several dates here during college so it holds a special place in my heart.  Tonight the service sucked...for us and people around us. People were ignored and the staff disappeared for dozens of minutes at a time. WTF were they doing? I couldn't resist. I looked into the server station and found out. Talking. They were simply BSing while tables were ignored. I would have left if I was the couple next to us that was ignored for probably 30 minutes or more.  As far as the food:  The bread is outstanding!  The creamy garlic salad is fantastic, but they initially forgot to add the dressing, which I had to wait for until just before the entree arrived.   Calamari was not crispy, either undercooked or it sat too long. The marinara was outstanding too (dip the bread in it).  Bruschetta was also top notch.   The pasta was not al dente...I think because it was fresh pasta not dried. I am unsure if I liked it or not. The Italian sausage was funky but I think it was because it was a real Italian sausage or maybe an aged Italian sausage. The dish overall was so salty! I tend to go overboard on salt and even I thought it was borderline. My wife and I split the pasta and she shoved her portion back onto my plate... and that NEVER happens!   I also thought it was annoying that the hostess greeted us by saying \"you have a reservation I hope\" when the place was not busy at all. Pretentious.   So give it a try, just carve out lots of time and be prepared to be ignored."}
{"text":"Ambience and setting are great but the food needs work. Chicken Marsala was dry and the potatoes were dried out too. Bistecca was \"leather\" according to my guest. Ravioli were doughy and Calamari appetizer was super bland. Having said this, our waitress Alex(a she) was terrific.  Work on the food gang, your setting deserves better."}
{"text":"I was working in an office for the day when they introduced me to a restaurant buff who eats out 6 nights a week.  He said that Madison, WI, has the most restaurants per capita than any major city in the nation.  He was so excited about talking about restaurants.  He sent us right downtown where there is a cluster of restaurants and a family friendly environment.  This was the place we stumbled into.  The food here was fantastic.  In fact, it turned me on to Italian food, and Precious and I have been toying with recipes and eating at different Italian places lately.  It's a quiet comfortable place with ample seating and good service."}
{"text":"A great place to eat when stopping in Madison. My family is half vegetarian and half normal. Very attractive ambiance, attentive staff. Everything but the lasagna can be made vegetarian. My daughter did that with the Brussels sprouts. I had the beet salad and it was excellent. My wife and daughter split the seafood pasta special. It looked very attractive. And they said it was excellent. The wine selection is extensive and they offer great local beer selections."}
{"text":"This place was a 4-5 star place for me when I first moved here a year ago.  Loved the ravioli and the Malbec.  However, tonight was a terrible dining experience.  Family was in town and brought them there.  It wasn't that busy and there but apparently was a party down in the Dragonfly Lounge.  We told the waitress we needed to be out of there by 7:15 and she said it'd be no problem.  We ordered at 6:20 or so and the food hadn't come out by 7.  Kept asking and people around us were getting their food.  We finally decided we had to leave and the food STILL wasn't out at 7:20.  NEVER got a visit to the table by the manager."}
{"text":"Pretty good food (one dish served cold). God-awful service, one woman worked her tail off while 2 others (guess sex) twiddled on their dumb phones. They also messed up the seating arrangements for a large party."}
{"text":"Bellini's is some of the most authetic Italian in the greater Madison area, if not all of Wisconsin. If I could, I would take a bath in their creamy garlic salad dressing, but because that's not socially acceptable I instead just dunk anything I can find on the table into it....   I have been to Bellini's for a number of occasions and have yet to be disappointed... Sorority formals, wedding receptions, and of course just a drunken ladies dinner. Every time I go it's an internal debate between the ravioli, the pesto chicken pasta, and the lasagna. I always get a side of the mashed potatoes though... LAY OFF ME I'M STARVING."}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss, and seems to be a miss recently.  I came here last summer and had an ok meal. A bit overpriced for just OK Italian food, but still had a nice dinner.  The atmosphere is rather inviting and the ambiance is nice. If you're into stuff like that, try hitting it up for lunch or a few drinks. I would say the dinner is definitely not worth the price.  We tried to go back last weekend and were told that there was a 15 minute wait, while we could easily see that the dining room had at least half of the tables open. I understand reservations, but I find it hard to believe that 8+ tables were all coming within the next 15 minutes. It also took awhile to even find a host (I think he was a waiter too?).  Madison seems to be in need of a niche upscale Italian restaurant. Hopefully Food Fight pulls through for us with their new opening on State Street."}
{"text":"Amazing chick dish with fresh great bread , win and calamari. Perfect for a cold day."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Good waitress and good service, but need to work on the food a little bit more.  It was five of us. Greeted by the wait staff, we were seated in the middle of the restaurant. I was amazed with the atmosphere. We arrived around 6, and had already made a reservation earlier. The restaurant however was not full at all. There were only 3 couples. Many empty chairs. Our table was ready. So we could learn the menu right after we were seated. Five of us ordered different meals. I ordered Manicotti Marinara- excellent. Fresh tomatoes! one friend loves her SPINACHI e PESTO con FUNGHI PIZZA. But, two other friends who ordered POLLO MARSALA complained that their food was way too salty! I tried and it was too salty. The chicken, the mushroom and the mashed potatoes are too salty.  The waitress was responsive though! She brought her another portion and it was finally to my friend's satisfaction.  The bread with olive oil was also good. The bread was still hot when served. Good sign!  Overall,  we love it! It was like eating in the church! :) The waitress was awesome too!"}
