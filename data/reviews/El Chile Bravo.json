{"text":"The food was really good and I love the atmosphere in the restaurant. There were only 3 issues. It may have just been an off night. It seemed to be server by committee, which is cool but it can make you feel like no one really cares, if you're not used to it. 2nd, I got rice instead of beans. But ultimately I got both!! Each was ok in their own right. 3rd, their Margarita need some work. Not a fan of the well tequila. I ordered the Cancun Cheesesteak and it was the tastiest dish I've had in a Mexican restaurant to date. I'm going to assume it was an off night and go back again soon. Food was awesome."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times but probably will wait a long time before trying them again. Chips and salsa are delicious, and food is fresh, tasty and piping hot. Draft beers come in large frosty mugs. My wife ordered sangria which tasted somewhat ok but came without any fruit in it.   Service was disappointing. Although our order was taken quickly, we never saw our original waiter again. Despite numerous apparently idle staff standing around, it was very difficult to get someone to bring us an extra plate and more chips and salsa. Nobody ever  checked in  on us and after about 25 minutes sitting and waiting for our check we had to find someone to bring it to us.   This restaurant has a decent atmosphere and food but the staff's lackluster attitudes probably will keep us away for a while."}
{"text":"Food was fresh, hot and flavorful. Service was quick and friendly.  And the margaritas were ok. Kinda light. I'll definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"Service was swift and staff was courteous. Atmosphere was casual but pleasant.   Nachos were fresh, salsa was ok, but I couldn't see it taste cilantro. The spicy salsa was tasty though.  But the rice (which is a side option even for the vegetarian combos) is not vegetarian. It's made with chicken broth. They assured us the beans are vegetarian.  It's in a strip mall along with a Drug Mart, a small grill/pub and - that's all. The rest of the bldg. Is actually being demolished. Hope this place lasts."}
{"text":"I've been here so many times times and the staff never disappoints. The food is always cooked perfectly and delicious. It's a family friendly environment and a great place to go with your friends. The food is never too expensive.  Tip: try the cheese dip it's simple yet different than any other restaurants"}
{"text":"When we walked in it was a great atmosphere nice People everywhere you go  and a very nice restaurant the chips were amazing and the salsa was very good if u don't like spicy things which I don't the service was great food was amazing and i don't know what that review above me is talking about they need to calm down this is a awesome restaurant and they need to unwad their panties because the food is very good and very authentic and the staff is very nice"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant. Large quantities of food for a very low price. The food is excellent, I've been here many times and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Always love the fajitas, perfect every time. Other items are always nice too. great margaritas (splurge for the \"fresh\"!) and good service! Super fast and friendly."}
{"text":"A gem of a place.  Great food, good portions, very friendly staff and excellent service.  Try the fajitas and ask them to add fresh jalapeños for a nice addition of heat."}
{"text":"Kris S. Has obviously never had Mexican food nor been in the atmosphere where authentic Mexican cuisine is served..  This restaurant is the first place in Ohio that serves the best Mexican Food and truly satisfies my appetite. Not only is the food as authentic but it really reminds me of home. I've been a little all around the world but I'm Mexican American and the food they serve here reminds me of my moms cooking. It's just as if you were to drive down south of the border and order this in Mexico. The atmosphere is just right for this type of restaurant and they really deliver the best quality of fresh and authentic Mexican.  My girlfriend actually came here right after being really disappointed at pacos tacos in Solon... They tried to give us bell peppers and fried peppers instead of actual jalapeños.  I really hope the people around the area give this place a chance. Try it out and just know that the food here is just as good as back in California and Mexicali Baja California, MX where I'm From.."}
{"text":"Ate here after a matinee, arrived around 7pm, ordered, received drinks, appetizers & entrée & walked out an hr. later. Was taken care of very well by the hostess & waiter, & he asked if we were from the neighborhood & thanked us for coming. We had ,margaritas & daiquiris, these were freshly made with fresh strawberries , not a premade cocktail. The apps were cheese with chorizo( Queso fundido) with tortillas & we ordered different entrées, all good. Not a complaint. total for bill, 34 bucks. Try it!"}
{"text":"How do you say 'meh' in Spanish?  Went on a Wednesday night around 5:30. We successfully beat the crowd that arrived during our meal. Service was fast, food arrived in remarkable time.  Was hot, was fresh, and plenty for leftovers. The Pollo Loco was too much to finish in one sitting. A great value overall. This may not be the most \"authentic\" Mexican restaurant, but portions, price, and freshness of ingredients make up for any short comings. Worth a try."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try somewhere we had never been and agreed to come here for dinner. What a HUGE mistake. We walked in and were seated in a timely manner. We received our chips and salsa and our menus. Then we waited...and waited...and waited. There were only 2 other customers in the restaurant. Finally the gentleman that seated us saw us looking around for a waitress and came over and kindly took our order. The food was ok...pretty average chimichanga...rice..beans..etc. Nothing special. We were finished eating and yet again sat and waited for a waitress. I finally got up and grabbed a box for our leftovers. A few minutes later a girl came over and my husband handed her his bank card. She came back and said sir...was your card broken? We were appalled to see his bank card cracked into 2 pieces. Are you kidding me? No we didn't hand you a broken card. What a horrible experience. We will NEVER go back. Stay away. ."}
{"text":"This place was ok. They offer tamales, which I'm told is tasty and authentic. However, the quality of their ingredients was fairly low and the steak pieces I had in my dish were fatty and overcooked.  (Generous portions, but I didn't even bother with the leftovers this time.) The restaurant is noisy, which I don't mind, although I do have to say that the waiter seemed to have forgotten our table a few times.  The salsa and chips were nice.  The hot salsa wasn't tomato based - just straight hot peppers - so we mixed with the regular salsa to make the perfect combo.  Typical rice and beans on the side, leaving me with an overall \"meh\" opinion. Better than El Camps but expected better."}
{"text":"Good food and service. Enjoyed the ambience. I was traveling and went based on Yelp reviews. I'll go again. I had the carnitas that was well prepared and not over cooked."}
{"text":"This place is 2 minutes from my house so I might be biased due to convenience but we love this place any night of the week. Everything is always clean and comes out WICKED FAST-and hot too! They have a good selection of food items and big drinks.   I always get the shredded chicken soft tacos and rice. My fav. Their shredded chicken is to die for-so flavorful. Any of the burritos are great too! We love their chips and salsa, could eat it all night-it isn't chunky and has the right amount of heat.   Service is always fast-however they cannot always understand you and you cannot always understand them. Our waiter got a little stressed with asking about beer selection and passed us off to another server. Didn't bother me- but others may be annoyed - be patient people - its called authentic! I will say they always walk away and Im like \"I have no idea what they heard-hopefully my order comes out right\" but I have NEVER gotten the wrong order. So thats awesome! I'll continue coming here!"}
{"text":"This institute was an exact replica of El Campesino. I instantly recognized the menu as the same thing but ordered differently.  Other than that, the food was great and the wait staff was on the ball. Odd payment system, as no one was posted up at the register. Great bar area and drink selection. Overall, it is a more adult version of El Campesino and an alright experience."}
{"text":"Great place- to eat in, or carry out. To-go dinners seem to have larger portion size than dine-in (fajitas). Great atmosphere and staff. Pay attention to your bill, have had some issues with calculations and coupons... but still, great small town, local place!"}
{"text":"Had their Tacos, it contained ground beef, lettuce and cheese that's it.  Ground beef was tasteless, it needed seasoning."}
{"text":"Dinner on Saturday around 5:30 pm. We were seated right away, I have to say this is one of the cleanest Mexican restaurants that I have been to. Brought chips and salsa promptly, server took our order . We ordered the fajitas for two, they were good. Came out pretty quickly... would have liked to enjoy the queso \"cheese sauce\" we ordered a few minutes longer since the fajitas came out pretty much right after we received the queso. After this our waitress was pretty hard to find. I think she had too many tables to wait on or something. I had ordered a margarita and it never came. I would have tried to ask for it if I could find her and for the fact we were more than half way through our meal when we did get a hold of her I figured I would pass. She did realize when she brought the check and took the queso off our bill so I do have to give her credit for that. I would have had liked a refill on my soda that I did order but that did not happen. All and all it was a good meal, could have been a better experience with the service. Will probably give them one more shot."}
{"text":"The food is yummy--fresh ingredients, generous portions, really good prices.  The service I've experienced is definitely on the lacklustre side.  I don't speak Spanish (that any native speaker can bear to hear!), and my server, on all three of my visits, seemed very tentative about English.  Although the restaurant has always been nearly empty on each of my visits--I tend to eat at \"off times\"--the manager has never stopped by--seemed glued to the TV and could hardly be distracted long enough for me to pay the bill.    I like the food well enough, though, to plan on returning.  Definitely my favorite Mexican restaurant in the Cleveland area--and I love Mexican cuisine."}
{"text":"After visiting a second time due to a pre-arranged family dinner, I can see the quality has improved. The service was better, the salsa was good and the portion sizes were huge (seriously, a single order of fajitas could be shared between two people with left-overs).  We ordered pitchers of what I would call their cadillac margaritas (containing Grand Marnier). Those I wasn't a fan of as they were extremely syrupy sweet, tasted like a premix, let alone tasting not very fresh. As for my order, my plate of carnitas was just okay. It was a large portion as well and I couldn't finish it. But at the same time I wasn't sad about it and didn't take the leftovers home. Bare in mind, I really love carnitas.  Now understand that my frame-of-reference is against other restaurants from my home town of Seattle, WA who has excellent Mexican cuisine. It's also measured against restaurants from my current place of residence, Los Angeles, CA where I've lived for 11 years. I've also eaten at many various Mexican restaurants in New York, Colorado, Oregon, Florida, Alabama, Tennessee, and especially around various parts of Mexico.  And with \"Eric O's\" attack on my credibility (which was very presumptive and fun to read), I do currently reside in a Latin American dominant part of the country, was engaged to a Mexican-American enjoying family cookouts religiously, and LOVE Mexican food having it as pretty much staple in my diet as proven by my belly. While this is just a personal preference of mine, I can speak for me and me alone that I've had much much better food out there and this place just isn't one of them. It might be fun for those who reside in the neighborhood, but I'm more inclined to explore other options next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place .. the margaritas and chips  and salsa are great! The food and the smell are not consistent ! We have gone here 3 times and the first time reeked of pinesol so much I couldn't eat it, the second time was amazing about a month ago and tonight the Bar side stunk with old rags and cleaning products so we moved our seat . Then ordered fajitas like the last time and they reeked of old fishy shrimp ( had the chicken, beef, shrimp fajitas ) that I couldn't eat. My husband had a cold so he couldn't taste or smell them. It's so close to our house and they treat you so nice that I wish it would be consistent!"}
{"text":"Was here a few weeks back for lunch and I must say the food and the service were good. Happy that I was able to find A good Mexican restaurant within a 5 minute drive of my home. Will be coming back here whenever the craving for Mexican arrises."}
{"text":"Located in the plaza in Reminderville. Great spot for consistently yummy Mexican food. Fajitas, chimichanga, taco salad, carnitas, quesadilla- all good choices. The chorizo cheese dip is awesome. Staff is friendly and the margaritas are huge!"}
{"text":"\"Third time's a charm!\" Or so they say, but not in my case.  Third time here and I left disappointed.  Thought I would give Chile Bravo my business and fill the homesickness void I have felt (food wise) since I left my native California.  I ordered Shrimp Tacos because they are always succulent and a great source of flavor if done right.  The waitress gets back to me telling me they don't offer them anymore because they are changing some items on the menu. Fair enough, so I ordered the chalupa with enchilada, rice and beans dish.  My husband ordered the Gallo Special which sounded a lot more delicious than what it looked or was.  His Gallo Special was a thin steak doused in white cheese and overcooked shrimp on top which were also smothered in white cheese. You can tell when shrimp is overcooked when it has curled inward all the way.  My dish consisted of a plate of you guessed it, the same white melted cheese with shredded lettuce and tomato on top with rice and beans with more melted white cheese.  I don't ever recall Mexican food ever having this much cheese.  And honestly, I love cheese but never this much? I can't even believe I'm saying this.  It was pretty bland too.  I guess I'm just disappointed and hope the chefs can come up with better dishes that resemble the more authentic taste of what Mexican cuisine is.  There is much room for improvement so I'm going to stay hopeful.  Will check back in a few months."}
{"text":"Love this place for good food and good margs! I always get seated right away and the staff is super nice! My favorite server is Andres, he goes above and beyond to provide a great dining experience! My favorite thing to order here are the \"Tacos Mexicanos\"! The steak in them is so flavorful and delicious, however they don't come with any lettuce or cheese, so I order that on the side as well.  I highly recommend the margaritas as well, you can definitely tell they have alcohol in them, which is a good thing to me!  Come during the week for different drink specials, like ladies night on Thursday!"}
{"text":"Great place for delicious margaritas after a long day of work. servers are pleasant and attentive and never dissapoint. it's not too busy, which is nice to sneak in for a drink or a late dinner. the food is good (fajitas are delicious) and meals always come out super quick. I can barely get my order out of my mouth before it's arriving at our table, sizzling hot. Nice atmosphere and just a nice stop for delicious mexican."}
{"text":"Loved it!  Food was great. Great service too.  Cheap beer.  We've been there twice - once when they first opened and then a month or so later.  We were very pleased both times. We'll be back."}
{"text":"A group of us came here a few months after it opened last summer.  It was a nice environment and the hostess gave us a booth that was away from everyone else. All of us were excited to eat here as it was close to us since we came from Reminderville, Ohio. After ordering some simple drinks we looked over the menu. The menu was vast with several options.  We were impressed just from the variety and possibilities which made this place look even more promising.  Well, we ordered our food.  No one ordered the same thing so it was something different for everyone.  We then began discussing personal plans and before we even started to make plans our food was done.  ALL of our food was done in less than 5 minutes!  We were not the only customers there at the time so it was a big surprise that our food arrived so quickly.  All of us commented, \"Wow, that was really fast.\"  We soon found out why.  It was somewhere between warming tray and microwave quality. How could this food be made so quickly when I ordered a quesadilla and taco combo?  One of my friends had ordered a dish with several ingredients to make his own taco/burrito and the refried beans portion was extra salty and had a burnt taste to it and kind of crunchy.  The beans were so salty it was appetite ruining.  I just tried one bite of the beans and it ruined my taste buds for my food.  When the waiter returned, we just told him to take our plates but our friend told him that his dish was \"bad and ruined his appetite\". My friend was able to get a refund for his meal but since we finished or mostly finished our meals we paid for ours.  Overall, I have to score this place low because the food was not what we expected.  I feel bad about our experience and earlier reviews like from Eric O. make me believe this was NOT the same place that night.  I want to give El Chile Bravo a second chance because it was in a GREAT area and had a wonderful environment for me to enjoy.  The atmosphere is a mood lifting experience but if the food is the same experience the next time we dine here then that's it for us."}
{"text":"We don't go out for Mexican, but on the rare occasion, we have eaten here. The food is decent but the service is Very lacking. First thing we noticed, on a day that temperatures have hit 90 degrees, was the air conditioning Was Not On or functioning properly. After we were seated, the server dropped off chips & salsa & was no more than 2 steps from the table when his cell phone came out & he was lookingat it while walking. Another almost 6 minutes went by before I got up from the table to get our server to get drinks. The 2 servers on staff felt the need to make excuses for their delay when there were maybe 5 other patrons in the place. The food was alright: I say this because my husband & I both orderedthe Tropical Burrito, all the meat was dry & the shrimp had been grilled to sheer chewiness. My son ordered chicken fingers & ff, which were overcooked & we weren't quite sure it was actually chicken... Previous visits have not left me this disappointed but this one has caused me to now avoid coming back. Of you want Mexican in the Twinsburg area, try El Camino. You're welcome."}
{"text":"I can walk here and it's good, solid Mexican food.  That's a solid 4 stars in my book.  I had a soft spot in my heart for Hook's which was in this location previously, mainly because it was a good, solid bar I could walk to.  El Chile Bravo packs in more people in a day than Hook's did in a week, which probably shows how much people love Mexican and margaritas more than anything else.  The menu is huge, like you expect.  The margaritas are huge, like you expect, even though they are a little overly flavored and the regulars look like Mountain Dew.  The food is delicious and well prepared.  How well prepared? I mean like I ordered one minute and 5 minutes later my complete meal came out.  Much like Chinese food, the key is preparation and these guys have it ready to fly out the door.  I have a personal going on between this, Barrio (tacos and tequila) and Tex Mex.  Are they all Mexican? Does it matter? Are they all good. Yes!  This place is in no way a destination, but is a solid addition to the location Mexican food choices."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out as my SO and I are on a quest to find Mexican restaurant as good as our favorite El Palenque in Eastlake.  We recently moved to Twinsburg and this place is 5 minutes from home.  We won't be going back.  It was nearly empty on a Saturday night and we were seated immediately.  We were put in a booth right next to the door.  In the middle of winter and with an infant.  We weren't offered a sling for the carseat, nor an extra chair. So be aware of that.  The hostess attempted several times after we were seated to take our drink and/or food order (within the first 5 minutes) and that felt a little pushy.  We placed our orders. I had a Cantarito cocktail, Al Pastor burrito, and a single cheese enchilada. My SO had some sort of half ground beef/half chicken burrito and a steak quesadilla.  The only thing that was pretty decent was my enchilada.  The marinated pork in my burrito looked like chunky bits of beef and the burrito itself fell apart.  I'm not sure if it was the way it was wrapped or if the burrito is just flimsy.  It also came with this strange sauce that I can only describe as made of beer and hot sauce.  It was effervescent and soooo strange. SO pretty much hated everything about his bland burrito.  The quesadilla also fell apart.  We had a hard time finding the hostess once we were done, for our bill.  Another worker happened to be passing and checked on us.  I will say that my drink was really good and a generous size. Plus they had chipotle Cholula on the tables.  Other than that, I'm not impressed in the slightest.  The search continues..."}
