{"text":"Went here for a quick weekend late breakfast/early lunch and were quite pleased. We ordered one of each taco: beef tongue, beef steak, al pastor pork, and chicken, as well as drinks. I got the horchata (rice based milky beverage), and my wife got the Mexican coffee which is quite mild roasted and has cinnamon and other spices added to it. Both were very tasty and non-gringo. They brought out some homemade tortilla chips as well as smooth red and green salsas to start with while we waited for the tacos. The red was particularly flavourful, not just hot. 

When the tacos came they were your typical taqueria double wrapped 4 inch tortillas, and we preferred the steak and pork amongst the four. They were a bit filling despite their size, but I managed to still get the dessert, a flan (Spanish style creme caramel). A nice touch here was the depression in the middle of the flan which held extra caramel sauce, and the texture and taste of the flan was very satisfying. 

In short, the drinks, salsa and dessert were above par, but the tacos just so-so. Good for a quick bite. The decor is minimal (a TV playing soccer in Spanish and a few maracas) and they are so new that they don't have menus yet... though the menudo (tripe soup) is widely advertised so maybe this and other off-the-beaten-path options we don't know about would raise the overall experience for the gastronomically adventurous or expats."}
