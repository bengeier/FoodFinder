{"text":"Great Service. Fantastic Food!

Best poutine in the city by far, well worth the trek. I've tried many in the city and the culmination of the cheese curd, gravy, and type of fry just makes it.

Service is always with a smile, willing to hear your added customizations unlike some pretentious french places I've been to. 

Just experienced their newly renovated patio, great place to bring friends for a drink and a french onion soup.

Can't say too many good things about this place!"}
{"text":"2.5 at best.

100+ seat resto with 2 servers. Needless to say things progressed slowly. Cellar was empty (reasonable value pairing  choices not available) and the food was average.

It was a dinner party for 7, and approached $700, I don't feel I got my money's worth."}
{"text":"Love going to this place for a lovely dinner. Been there twice now and both times the food was fantastic. Looking through the other reviews, perhaps we were the lucky ones :) 

Special note: If you love maple syrup, this is the pace for you. It is infused in a lot of their dishes as a Quebecois element. The butter is so good!"}
{"text":"Very nice place. The food was excellent. To start, we had the salmon tartar. I had the seafood crepe for the main. I would order both again without a thought. My girlfriend had the chicken supreme, and also said it was amazing.

Only issue was the slow service. I'm pretty sure our server forgot about us. It took 40 minutes for the app, then another 15 minutes to see the wine list. In total, dinner took 2 hours (no dessert, and only 2 of us). I'm glad we weren't in a rush, and I have a lot more patience when then food is that good. I would go back again, it was probably just one of those nights (or I'd sit in a different section)"}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to dine at Le Papillon on the Park on different occasions: both work and leisure related. The stylish layout of the restaurant was light and airy. The menu items were tasteful...it was difficult to decide on one dish! I had the p'tit poulet crepe on one visit and the tourtiere on another. Both dishes did not disappoint. Shared the pudding chomeur with my hubbie. Very yummy. The service was excellent and very attentive. Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"My wife and had our anniversary dinner at Le Papillon, and we were not disappointed. 

The restaurant has a nice casual decor about it, and a patio upstairs with a separate menu. 

We sat downstairs because the poutine was on the downstairs menu. One of the better poutines I've had outside of Montreal. 

Everything we had on the menu was exceptional. The bartender made the best Caesars (very hard to find a good caesar in a restaurant). 

The staff were very friendly and knowledgable.

Overall a great experience. Will be again."}
{"text":"Woke up late on Easter Sunday. Walked out of the house wanting a late lunch somewhere. I headed to Bistro Camino only to find it closed so what the heck, it's a nice day, I wanted to go down to the beaches anyway, and maybe read a book. I figured I'd have a go at trying Le Papillon on my way there. 

Walked in right after brunch had ended so I was really the only person dining there at the time. So \"lunch\" had just turned into an early, early dinner. Ordered the steak frites medium rare and sat back to read while they prepared it.

Disappointed to find that it was cooked closer to medium than medium rare. I've done more tender steaks from chinese supermarket flank cuts in comparison to this relatively chewier AAA striploin. The maitre d'hotel butter hindered more than helped the taste of the meat by overpowering it. The frites were nothing to write home about either. 

I might be tempted to go back for a try of their brunch at least once (that second floor patio of their's just looks too good to pass up)."}
{"text":"Great cozy atmosphere.  This is one of our go-to date night venues.  In the winter they sometimes have cheese fondue (my fave).  My go to main is the steak au poivre which is to die for. It is all I can do to not lick the plate.  And a must have is the pouding chomeur.  My mother-in-law always makes me order one to go for her as compensation for babysitting."}
{"text":"These 5 stars go to Papillon because their food is great but also to balance out these incredible inadequate ratings from people who seem to have lost their touch with reality.
The crepes are superb and the service is very attentive. As soon as I had a sip of water my glass was refilled. So much for the fairy tales of certain people who should rather stay in Leslieville if they think that's the crown of creation."}
{"text":"So disappointed after a recent birthday dinner at Le Papillon Park.  We were given only one menu for two of us when we sat down, no booster seat was offered for our son (had to search it out), the food took a really long time, and it was not good. The appetizer was cold and the steaks were terribly tough and one was overcooked. Couldn't finish mine and finally had to tell the server it was actually really bad...a manager came over to apologize and they took the steaks off the bill. Didn't make up for a crappy birthday dinner though...desserts were the best part of the meal. On top of that, there was a dirty fork at my place setting and the water glasses weren't re-filled until we were done our meal...even if the kitchen was running behind, you could make up for that with more attention to detail with drinks, service, etc. So disappointed, as we've had good meals at this place in the past....but it's nothing like it used to be:("}
{"text":"Arrived on Sat. night with a 7 PM reservation. The restaurant was only 2/3 full. We had finally had a complete dinner by the time we left, totally exasperated three and one half (3.5) hours later.

The waiter was totally uninterested and totally forgot us, never checking in on anything. The little bread we had for entertainment (?) while we W A I T E D was soon gone, our water glasses were empty most of the time, We asked for ice with our water and got a small tumbler with ice cubes. We did get one drink soon after sitting down, but no offer of any more, nor were we asked if we wanted to order some wine. We had to go find the waiter to get wine.

It took an hour to get the appetizer. The main dish came 1.5 h later. The food was quite tasty, but mine had been under the heater for a very long time and was well dried out before we all received our main dish together.

I looked into the kitchen, it was full of hands moving swiftly so the slow service cannot have been for lack of staff there. Was it for a total lack of management skills instead?

In all, a very unremarkable meal, intended as a birthday celebration at a \"better\" restaurant.

This was our two visits in one - The first and the last.

The access to the ample parking lot was over some newly moved grass on  a myddy path, it had rained and our shoes got soaked on exiting the restaurant. How about at least some gravel on the path?"}
{"text":"Quite surprised how this place has such high reviews. The decor and ambiance is great, service was pretty good. Must have been a busy week because of the 4 wines we asked for they didn't have 3 of them. I judge a place by its pate, especially a French restaurant, and this place did pretty badly: whilst the foie gras pate had great texture it was almost tasteless except for cream and was missing salt, the chicken pate was OK but overly sweet as it came bruleed, and the the texture of the pork pate was thick, dry and average at best. Had the duck special for main which was cooked to perfection, however the celeriac puree was under seasoned and lacking flavour with the fig jus too sweet and one dimensional. Again the whole dish lacked seasoning. Girlfriends meat pie tasted good but was fairly dry and the meat was grey. Overall it is decently priced especially the wine (the options they did have in stock) and and the service wasn't bad but the food was average and I would never order the pate again. I might go back, but no time soon."}
{"text":"Love this spot. My husband and I find it romantic and quite a treat. The food has always been good and the service quite doting. The dining room is pretty, love the new lounge, and the rooftop terrace during the summer is quite a fab spot"}
{"text":"Good place. It's huge so you can usually get a table last minute. Location downtown is a bit better on food quality but, this one is still worth the trip."}
{"text":"Finally a great time at  Le Papillon!  We have gone a couple of times before - usually every 4 or 5 months we try this place and I will say that every time we go it gets a little bit better.  But this last visit was by far the best.

We went for lunch on a Friday.  The service started out BRUTALLY slow, but once they took our drink orders it quickly improved.  I enjoyed the French onion soup  followed by the Tourtiere.   The portion was a great size and I left feeling sated.  My guest had the steak and frites.  Guessing by the clean plate, I'd say she enjoyed her meal as well.

I'll be going back more often"}
{"text":"As you drive along Eastern Ave and see countless auto-body shops, TTC streetcar storage lot, industrial buildings, you then come to a nice little pocket where Papillon is, overlooking a park.  The building is interesting with lots of exposed brick, the large space is broken up into smaller more intimate areas, the walls are covered in contemporary art, and there are lots of windows overlooking the park.

I've been twice (and also twice to their restaurant on Front St).  The food is always excellent, and the menu changes seasonally.   For brunch the poutine au matin is a winner, and the steak frites and croque monsieur are also very nice.  The staff if gracious and efficient, the server checked in on us often enough to take care of any needs, but not so often as to be intrusive.

There are certainly some fine-dining flourishes, but the overall atmosphere is friendly, warm, and cozy."}
{"text":"My best friend and I visited the restaurant tonight (Friday) for early dinner at 5pm, and were thoroughly impressed! 

Food: we both ordered a crepe (p'tit poulet and champion ) and found that it was reasonably priced (~$15 each). Before our crepes arrived, we were served with fresh baked bread with maple infused butter. The slight sweetest of the butter was a nice touch, and the bread had a crisp crust and was soft and moist within. The crepes were presented nicely, and looked very appetizing. The crepe itself was  light and fluffy, and both crepes had just the right amount of filling. The p'tit poulet had a creamy sauce that was rich but not heavy, and was filled with spinach and mushrooms.The champion had spinach, mushrooms, sautéed shallots, and béchamel and was a savory treat! I would highly recommend either one of those crepes and would definitely order it again.

Drinks: the special tonight were mojitos. I ordered one with gin and freshly picked basil leaves and blueberries from their upstairs garden. My friend got the original, and both were refreshing, and not too sweet. 

Environment: the environment was quiet as we were the first customers in for dinner. The wooden tables were lined with a blue checkered runner, and the utensils and bread plate was nicely put together, a perfect combination of peaceful country and city chic. 

Service: when we entered the restaurant, we were immediately greeted with a welcoming hello. Our server was pleasant, friendly, and informative, and ensured that our food and drinks was to our likings. She knew menu through and through.

Overall, we have fallen in love with this restaurant, and would definitely go back again soon. It is a great place for a small family gathering, girls night out, or romantic date. I can't wait to try their weekend brunch!"}
{"text":"We waited over one and a half hours for our main entree to come! Ridiculous! 
Service was cold. Our server wasn't even overly apologetic for the huge delay. He told us when the table behind us was done our food would be out in another 10 min. How many people are working in the kitchen anyways? 
Food was meh! 
Restaurant was huge and had great ambience but couldn't make up for the lack of service and sub par food.
I wouldn't waste my time here."}
{"text":"Food and service were excellent. I highly recommend!!  We were a large group for a friend's birthday last night and they handled it very well.  We were a bit of a pain and wanted split bills and we had people coming and going but they were very patient with us. I ate the steak tartare and the pastèque salad and both were delicious. The ambience inside the restaurant and on their patio was perfect!  Great place for a romantic dinner as well. Thank you for a great night!"}
{"text":"A nice addition to the neighbourhood. (read: McDonald's is no longer the only choice on Eastern)

This place will be a great summer spot--2nd floor rooftop deck overlooking a park will be a hit. And they've done a great job on the renovations--minimalist decor without the feel of eating in a gallery space. 

Had dinner here last week and really wanted to rave about it... Although there was nothing wrong with the meal, nothing about the food has made me take the 2 minute walk over for lunch in the past several days.  Don't get me wrong, everything was very good (Lamb Shank, Escargot, Raclette, and Crepe) but nothing made me a convert.

A solid B+, I'd definitely suggest giving it a try, but for the price point there is some stiff competition on Queen east!"}
{"text":"I read a couple bad reviews and I can't understand them. My friends and I had such an amazing time here. I went to this place for a friend's birthday party  and everything was so great. The building is so cool and they even had real fire places! My friends had Moules Maudites and escargot which were fantastic and I had the most amazing French onion soup I've ever tasted. For my main course I  had the Steak Au Poive which is a filet with a brandy sauce and my boyfriend had the lamb shank. We though our meals were so tasty. At the end we had the sugar pie and it was great.  My server even taught me how to say some things in French! We went on a Thursday and the  place was really busy but despite that the staff were very attentive. It's a really warm place and I'm glad we have a place in the Leslieville area that my friends and I can frequent more often."}
{"text":"I went to Le Papillon On The Park last night on a double date, my friend and her husband suggested the restaurant.  My SO and I were driving on Eastern Ave and nearly missed the restaurant, it is hidden in the industrial section of Eastern Ave.  To our surprise, the restaurant was packed when we got there.

Atmosphere

It was very open yet intimate, we got a corner table for the 4 of us.  It felt like we were in a parisan cafe.

Food

During the week they have fixed price menu for $30 for 3 courses!  I decided to go with the fixed price menu while my SO ordered an entree.

Appetizers

Soup du Jour - Spiced Pumpkin - so comforting and delicious, the right amount of spice.  A perfect autumn soup. (part of my fixed price menu)

French Onion - we looked over at our friend's french onion soup and had to order the french onion soup for ourselves.  Broth was rich and flavourful, the cheese was perfectly baked on.  The only downside is that we wanted more cheese and a bigger portion!  ($8)

Entrees

Moules et Frites (mussels and fries) - oh so good, the mussels were perfectly steamed.  The broth was wonderful, excellent for dipping my bread in.  I wish they gave more bread to soak up the broth (part of my fixed price menu)

Seafood Papillon (it is not called this but I forget the name) - it was a seafood dish with a lovely tomato broth and garlic bread.  The seafood was well seasoned and cooked perfectly (not rubbery).  My SO gobbled it up. ($28)

Dessert

Pouding Chômeur - this is like a french english sticky toffee pudding, sweet yet warm and comforting.  The ice cream it was accompained made the best cold and warm combination.  I was glad I was sharing the dessert, it was a bit of a sugar rush/coma. (part of my fixed price menu)

Service 

Excellent service, very attentive, no complaints.  The pace of our food was brought out perfectly timed, we were not waiting too long between courses.

Overall, Le Papillion on the Park makes a great date night out.  I would recommend it if you are in the Riverside area."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best restaurants in the city. Food is consistenly good,  great staff, and ambiance. Their steak au pouvre (steak, mashed potatoes,  cooked veggies) is awesome.  

Desserts not great though (way too rich and too sweet)"}
{"text":"**We arrived on Boxing day around 3pm..with a group of 15 adults and 7 kids (yes we made a reservation they knew we were coming).  There was 3 other tables in the place (one a party of about 10).

**I must say the place is nice to look at in an industrial kind of way. Long hallway with tables off to the sides and big locked frenched doors all along the east wall, overlooking the P PARK.  Will give them a break on this since summer hasn't arrived and they just opened in the fall....

**Our ONE and ONLY server (yep that's right, for 22 people one person)  bless her heart. She couldn't really give the service we needed, the owner was there but didn't offer a hand, a busboy was on hand after all was done.  Enough on that , you get the picture.

**On to the food, many dishes were ordered I can only comment on the ones I tasted (by the way I had to order what I really didn't feel like because they had no Smoked Pork Loin).  I had  the smoke salmon appetizer is was very good, and so did many in our party and they were all happy with it....the kids had esgargot they loved them but they also loved the smallish portion cold poutine with lumpy gravy, restaurants should be kinder to the little people.  I had the atlantic salmon for main was cooked perfect, veggie sides were boring but palatable.  Didn't have dessert.  Some dishes our party raved about:  French Onion Soup, The Crepes and Steak Poivre.  Overall the food went off well and satisfied.

**Now to the HOT part, it was so friggin hot in this place. They have double sided fireplaces that were roaring and the heat must have been on.  Being December we were all dressed for winter, however it was mild outside.  We did ask if they could open one of the doors near us but nooooo, this could not be done.  Even the kids were complaining and they were good up to this point.

**It was a great place to have a group at this time of the day. We felt very much on our own (we liked this)...We would go back but not running there.

all said.....with a tonne of wine and auto tip ....$1400.00"}
{"text":"I have never noticed this restaurant and only by fluke in taking the wrong street did my parents and I discover there was a restaurant here! We immediately noticed the great large patio on the roof of the restaurant and vowed to return. Fall is now here and we did not get to come back for the patio, but my boyfriend wanted to try this eatery on a side street and I knew it was Le Papillion on the Park!

Intro. When entering, I noticed just how LONG the restaurant was. Seating was ample and there were quite a few people eating here on a Saturday afternoon. Lot's of great cocktails and booze options and I immediately ordered a La Rosette which is champagne with Elder Flower in it...very sweet and not really my thing. My boyfriend was introduced to a great Caesar made with Bacon infused Vodka and it was so delish!

Food. The menu is geared towards Quebecois cuisine with a section devoted to crepes entirely. Our waiter initially told us about some great scallops that were brought in from \"last night\" and not being scallop lovers, we passed. After some time, our waiter again tried to sell us on the scallops... we weren't feeling like eating leftovers!

I had the Eggs Benedict on a croissant which hit my hungry spot and my boyfriend ordered the Lamb Crepes with Apples and Raisins. The lamb was so delish and the apples made it just right. The raisins were a bit much (according to him it made the dish too sweet), but over all, really good. We had just enough room for dessert and we shared the Bread Pudding (forgot the name, but it was called Le Chaumer?) with ice cream. I really enjoyed that. 

Service. From reading previous Yelps, it seems that service can be really hit or miss. Our waiter for that afternoon was not that bad - efficient where it needed to be. He also made some great cocktail recommendations and even made unique combinations just for us. Towards the end, he was nowhere in sight but nothing too major. 

In conclusion, I think this is a great find to the immediate area. As another Yelper mentioned, we now have something more than the Harvey's and Swiss Chalet! I was also thinking that this place would be GREAT for Sunday brunch. It seems like it could handle lots of people. I will definitely be back to try it out!"}
{"text":"I came with a group of four on a thursday night; it was very quiet inside but the patio was packed. I personally had the p'tit poulet crepe (chicken, spinach, mushroom, shallots, white cheddar), and within our group we also ordered the rafael crepe (shrimp, scallop, mushroom), the saute fruits de mer, and the daily soup.
Their drinks were very good! One of the bartenders' specialties is a blueberry mojito which was delicious.
Food was only moderate, nothing too special. The p'tit poulet was good upon the first few bites but very quickly became too heavy for my liking and definitely too much in one serving - I was unable to finish my crepe.
The service was good. We had a very kind and attentive waitress who was quick to modify my drink order when it had been made incorrectly."}
{"text":"On Saturday, my husband planned a date night. The intention was to go somewhere on the west end of the city but with all the weekend events, we decided to take our business east. The area La Papillion is located in is just lovely and quiet. 
We made our reservations on OpenTable. But was running late, so I called ahead to let them know. It was no problem. There is free parking lot off to the side of the building and there's lots of space. The entrance is cozy. Once you walk in, the restaurant is huge. They divided it in sections with a waiting lounge area and different dining sections. The walls are decorated with painting by local artists. The hostess immediately sat us. We weren't sitting more than 5 mins. Just looking around and observing our surroundings when a waiter approached us and was apologetic that no one has took our drink orders... But we didn't even have a chance to look at the menu. It was very nice of him to check on us tho. He made a few suggestions and our order was in.

The food...
We ordered the escargots to start. We got 6 pieces in a garlic butter. It was very good. For entrees  I had the peppercorn steak - medium rare. It was very tasty. The peppercorn was not overpowering and gave it a nutty crunch. This was delicious! 
Dave got the Pork. His was cooked to perfection. I believe there was a fruit condiment go eat it with. 
The portions are moderate. For us it was fine and we didn't feel stuffed after. But for someone with a big appetite, the portion might not be enough. 

We really enjoyed our dinner. The timing for when items come out of the kitchen is perfect. We didn't feel rushed, and got to enjoy our time out. 
For all these reasons, I would go again.

There is a beautiful patio upstairs. It was a chilly night so we were in the formal dining but I would go for their brunch menu one weekend soon."}
{"text":"Fantastic, friendly, non-pretentious service. The food is always great.

Love, love, love, love the duck two ways.  It is one of my favorite things to eat in the city. The rabbit stew was also amazing. The house salad is so huge it's almost a whole meal in and of itself.

Very good poutine, as well. We just had the traditional version, as I was introducing my mom from the States to the dish for her very first time, which naturally she loved. We will def. try one of the more uniquely Papillon-style poutine creations next time.

Highly recommend this place for date night, special occasion dinners, or just because. If arriving right at opening, no need for a reservation, but I would definitely recommend it during peak hours.

Only downside to this place is the truly awful art on the walls. There are a few decent paintings hanging here, but by and large they're train wrecks on canvas. The art is the only thing I would change about Papillon on the Park.

Now that summer's here, can't wait to sit on the upstairs outdoor patio!"}
{"text":"Wow, this was a really disappointing experience!

My husband and I had been meaning to try this restaurant for quite some time since it's in our neighborhood and we love french dining.

We were celebrating our 2nd wedding anniversary and thought it would be a great opportunity to try it. We had just returned from a trip to the south of France and thought what better way to reminisce about our trip than with a lovely french dinner on our special day.

We were not impressed. To start we ordered a couple of pre-dinner glasses of prosecco and mentioned that we would be ordering a separate bottle for our main course. She took the wine menu and said she would return with it before our meals arrived but she never did.

The appetizers were very mediocre.  I had the duck and brandy liver pate from the 
Thanksgiving menu. It seemed quite dry and although this entree was to come with crispy garlic bread there was no hint of garlic at all on any of the breads.

The mains then arrived and we had not been given a chance to select a wine! She ran off to find a menu. By the time we were given the menu, picked the wine and had it delivered and opened our meals were cold.

At that point I had tasted my lamb chops and they were very over cooked. I ordered medium rare and they were very well done, not a hint of pink. The server offered to replace them but then I would be sitting there on our anniversary eating nothing while my husband ate his meal alone and vice-versa when mine arrived so ultimately I decided to just suck it up and eat them. Very blah, couscous was dry and flavour was very bland. Chops were dry and greasy.

In recompense for the disappointment our server said she would tie the napkin on our bottle of wine in a special way in order to celebrate the special occasion. Whaaat? Oh that's awesome. Thanks a bunch.

We ordered a desert to split. It wasn't memorable. I was surprised that she even charged us for the dessert since we were so disappointed on this special occasion.

Don't go here if you are expecting a real French experience. What was potentially a regular go-to restaurant for us turned into a place that we will mostly likely never visit again."}
{"text":"I'm trying not to be very mean here.
me and 4 other of my friends went to this place on a Sunday for brunch on 11:40 a.m. the place was not so busy.maybe three or four other tables.They took our orders very late,about 12:10(imagine how hungry we could be for a Brunch). We waited forever to get our food ,so finally my friend complains and after taking them another 10 minutes to figure out what has happened the manager came and apologized,she said somehow the order was lost in the kitchen!!! 
I'm not saying that this is a supernatural thing,it can happen.I totally get that.but it was our waiter's responsibility to ask for our food.She sees that other people who have come later are getting their food and we are sitting there for an egg and cheese to get ready!! she could have asked the kitchen way earlier/
anyway,the manager took everything except the drink off our bills,which is why I'm giving them the two stars.
The food finally came around 1:00 p.m .I can't really complain about the food.it was well-dressed and tasteful but not something to remember."}
{"text":"I had my hopes up when we entered this restaurant based on reading their menu online . Unfortunately, while the menu sounds appealing, the dishes we had were lacking in any unique qualities that would make them stand out. I had the crepe with scallop and shrimp. While the quality of the shellfish was very good, there was absolutely no flavour in the sauce. I would definitely go back as I am still interested in other items on the menu, but my first experience here has left much to be desired."}
{"text":"Your mother will really like this place. This is a safe restaurant where decent, familiar foods are served in a really nice environment by lovely staff. If your idea of a good restaurant includes words like \"pretty\" and \"nice\" and \"comfortable\", welcome home."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem.  How wonderful to stay on the patio on a breezy day and just enjoy delicious brunch specials with wicked cocktails.  My bestie and I had brunch cocktails: Mimosa and Bacon Caesar.  They were both textbook delicious and refreshing.  The Caesar was a meal on its own with a double smoked bacon and cheese in it.  

I enjoyed my prime rib Benedict on a croissant.  So decadent and meaty, an easy cure for my hangover!  My dearest had the Poutine Matin, which had the same flourishes as in Quebec, sausages and bacon!  It is a true and tasty classic.

But the piece de resistance was the warm pudding dessert with maple cream and homemade vanilla ice cream.  This is the bomb diggity and our awesome server, Kara, did not even give me a choice.  She told me that this was the only dessert to have.  Thank you Kara!

Great service, food and ambiance.  It is worth the trip to East end!"}
{"text":"The personification of unremarkable. In other words: I expected much better. 

We were a party of six adults, professionals, parents, and looking forward to nice evening out sans children. What we received was the antithesis of a nice evening. 

The one star I give is for the bar staff upstairs. The highlight of the night by far.... Four of us arrived early to enjoy cocktails on the rooftop patio while we awaited the final couple. The staff upstairs were friendly, attentive, and easy to be in the company of. 

That all ended when we went downstairs for dinner.

Our server in the dining room was, for lack of a better term, unprofessional. That's not to say he didn't look the part, he simply lacked the refinement one expects from a restaurant of this nature. We had to flag the waiter down to get our order in--not good. We ordered wine for the table, but he brought only four glasses--there were six of us, remember. We asked two more wine glasses, he brought the wine list...? It was puzzling. He was also argumentative when one of us said their Mojito was bitter and asked it to be remade. 

Now the food: For the prices, not good. I had the lamb--it was cooked right, but the balance of the plate was pedestrian at best. Four boring fingerling potatoes and some micro greens. The berry compote was a one-note bore. I actually longed for a bottle of A-1 sauce just to give the plate some life. 

Others at the table said their meals were, well, blah. The waiter had to ask two members of the party to cut into their steaks to makes sure they received the right one. Are you kidding me? This place masquerades itself as a high-end restaurant, and yet the chef and waiter can't communicate which steak is which? 

The pouding chomeur for dessert was good, but the accompanying ice cream was flavorless. 

Of note: if you order green tea, it takes them a good half-hour to prepare it. We'd all received our cafe au laits and desserts before our friend's tea arrived. Bizarre. 

The night was capped by one final idiocy. No bill. We sat there, wallets out, credit cards in hand, but our waiter simply never came back. In fact, I finally got up walked around the corner in front of the kitchen's pass and braced a server's assistant, gave him my credit card and said, \"We'd like to leave.\" We never did see our waiter again. Perhaps he vaporized--more likely he retreated upstairs for a break with the cool staff on the patio. Or something. 

My wife and I had been there before on a fund-raiser, and although the food was just okay then, we chalked it up to a small budget for the fund-raiser and vowed to give the place a second chance for the ambiance and location. We know enough now not to go back. 

It's a shame, there are very few nice restaurants on the east side of Toronto. I've had better food and better service at The Roy, Frankly Eatery, Lady Marmalade, and The Green Eggplant.

As a restaurant owner, when you recognize a party of six as being \"new faces,\" ordering cocktails, bottles of wine, apps, entrees, desserts,  coffees, would you not make certain these people are having a pleasant experience? Ensuring they return again and again as couples, with others, etc., etc., should be a core focus, oui? 

Le Papillon on the Park did the precise opposite--they did everything possible to ensure we didn't return. And we won't."}
{"text":"Abysmal.

I was really looking forward to a romantic dinner with my long-distance boyfriend, who visited all the way from Arizona. After hearing nothing but wonderful things about Le Papillon, their patio, as well as the newly-instated corkage program, we were excited to check it out.

Such a disappointment.

We arrived sans reservations and waited nearly 15 minutes to be seated while there were plenty of empty tables. Our server was friendly however we waited at least another 20 minutes before someone came by and offered to open/pour our wine that we had brought in. We quickly placed our entree orders, as we were getting hungry: my boyfriend ordered steak frites and I ordered the mussels. 

Now I am not exaggerating when I say that we waited over an hour for our entrees to arrive. Our server explained to us that the dumbwaiter (food elevator) was broken, and that's why our meals were taking so long. 

I'm sorry but seriously? Nobody could carry two plates of food upstairs???

Our food finally arrived to the table. My mussels were cold to the touch, they'd obviously been sitting around for a while. My boyfriend's steak was overdone. 

Frustrated and famished, we asked our server to take the food back and bring us the bill, which she did and kindly profusely apologized. Although they did not charge us for the entrees, we shockingly still had to pay the $15 corkage fee.

We essentially paid to sit hungry on a patio for an hour and drink our own bottle of wine. We could have easily done that at home - for free. 

The real kicker of this whole saga was that the owner, Danielle Bigué, mingled and said hello to every single table on the patio that evening - except she conveniently avoided ours. She didn't even have the decency to approach us after the food was sent back or apologize.

We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Hello, I've been to the Papillion on the Park twice for dinner and once for brunch and have enjoyed my experience each time!  I'm surprised that it isn't rated more highly

For dinner, I've had the french onion soup, the Crepe Raphael (shrimps, scallops in a cream sauce) and the Aubergine Fouree  The soup is delicious.  Although it's a broth, it has a nice heft to the broth.  It is well seasoned and full of flavour.  I loved my seafood crepe.  The crepe had the right balance of crispy and chewy.  It had thee large scallops and good-sized shrimps all covered in a light cream sauce.  The Aubergine was also very well done.  It's one of the more creative and delicious veggie entrees I've had.  The eggplant is stuff with quinoa, corn and pumpkin  The flavours come together really well.  In my experiences to date, I've been very impressed with the entrees.  Service was smooth and efficient, but nothing remarkable.  I will say the evening ambiance in the space is beautiful.  It is nice high ceilings with windows running along one side of the room.  There are multiple fireplaces which provide a wonderful warmth to the space, specially in the wintertime!   

For brunch, we had a group of 15 celebrate my wife's birthday.  First off, they were wonderful in hosting us.  We were definitely a big group, but also had several newborns with us.  They welcome us, the babies and the baby stuff (strollers, bags, etc.) with open arms.  The food was solid.  I had the french toast, my wife had the smoke salmon benedict.  We also shared the poutine and the poudding chameur (dessert).  I wasn't a big fan of my french toast, it was a tad too soft for my liking, but my wife really liked it.  She was also a fan of her benedict.  They do a good job with the poutine: crispy shoestring fries with a good amount of gravy and cheese curds.  The poutine felt expensive for the size.  Lastly, the poudding is a fairly hefty cake covered in a delicious sweet syrup.  It's similar to a sticky toffee pudding cake made with white sugar instead of brown sugar.  It was really tasty if you ask me!  

Entrees were mid-teens to low twenties, with brunch entries priced in the mid-teens.  Personally, I think it's a much better deal for dinner!  And the character of the space shines more at night.

All-in-all, a great space for some reasonably priced French/Quebecois food.   Great ambiance, especially in the wintertime and good for big groups!"}
{"text":"Excellent Service, Delicious Meal, Great Atmosphere.  Very seldom recommend but this is a very good one."}
{"text":"Came here for my anniversary about a year ago. This place was very nice, however it just didn't give me that oomph. Maybe I'm just hard to impress, but I didn't feel the magic. 
Regardless, I loved the food and service. The place could be more cozy, however it wasn't too bad. 
Escargots were our appetizers, however I didn't find that they popped. Myra they were exotic and french, but I've cooked better myself as I don't exactly cook. 
For our main, both me and my boyfriend got the crepes (I got the goat cheese one!) and it was delish. The crepes are just a mash of everything that tastes good wrapped up elegantly together. If I had to recommend anything about this place, it would be the crepes. 
The service was alright, expected a bit more for such a nice plus + the price Im paying for food. 
The decor is absolutely stunning. It's quite dim, but the olden brick walls and paintings look brilliant. 
Overall, it's a cute place. But cute places could be found all over Toronto while leaving my wallet a bit more full."}
{"text":"This was our second time at Le Papillon, having first had a bad experience shortly after their opening.

We sat down for about 10 minutes before anyone asked us for a drink - it's the kind of place where staff avert their eyes so as to avoid eye contact.  My water glass was empty for most of the meal

We had the poutine, tourtiere, and steak frites.  While the poutine was good, the steak frites was not cooked to order (not even close), and the salad accompanying the tourtiere was dressed with a solution so saline you couldn't eat it.  Also - the wine selection is cheap and tastes like it.   

The crowd is very unlike most L-vill restaurants - definitely skewing silver, and perhaps more forgiving of mediocre food and awful service.   At last a restaurant that makes eddie levesques look polished and welcoming."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere in a very stylish restaurant, much larger than you'd expect. The appetizers were great, the ceviche could've used more fish, but that's about the only slightly negative thing I could say.

We had tourtière and veal as our mains, the veal was cooked perfectly to a medium rare and the tourtière was full of flavour.

The deserts were a perfect contrast, a tart cranberry and cherry crêpe and a very sweet pudding chômeur. 

The service was outstanding, couldn't say enough good things about our server"}
{"text":"Was quite disappointed despite how promising the restaurant looked and felt. Went there for brunch for the first time with my family. Food took a long time and came out at different times for the entire table. Food was mediocre and luke warm. 

Server was not warm nor attentive and caught him swearing under his breath walking pass dealing with another table. Had to ask for coffee and water refills multiple times. Sadly, wont be returning to this establishment. So much potential..."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful brunch here on Sunday. 
This place has wonderful French food and some great French Canadian specialities including Sugar Pie. 

We had a beef stew with salad and baguette with maple butter. A fantastic Pinot Noir. And best of all shared the (must have) Banana Crepe Royale. Do not miss this!  

Our server was knowledgeable about the food and wine and had great recommendations. 

Parking in the lot next well works well. 
Ambiance is wonderful. Very much in line with the food."}
{"text":"When I was a kid, we used to do brunch at the Papillion at least a couple times a year.  So when I came home for a visit and my Mom told me there was now a new location in Leslieville, I was feeling quite nostalgic and looking forward to celebrating a belated birthday at the new location.

Given that the downstairs is essentially long and thin, the space feels surprisingly roomy.  I loved the fireplaces - but then, I'm a sucker for fireplaces.  

I started with the scallops, which were quite tasty if not a little bland.  They could have used just a little \"something\" to really make the taste pop.  The puree they were served with did give a nice (if bland) accent, and the scallops themselves were cooked perfectly.  

From there I had the mignon de porc.  The pork was again cooked perfectly, but four little slices for $26 is, while not unexpected, a bit disappointing.  I was also a little comfused, as the vegetable side was supposed to be sauteed mushrooms and braised leek; the mushrooms were there, but there were no leeks.  Kale, but no leeks.  The potatoes were a little sad too; a little garlic would have made them quite a bit more tasty.  

My Mom had the escargot to start, and the one I tried was delicious.  Loved the garlic butter and the escargot itself had great texture.  She then had the Tourtiere, which again, had great flavour.  It actually made me feel a little sad I hadn't tried something a little more likely to have a bit of a flavour punch.

For dessert I chose the pouding chomeur, which was probably my favorite dish of the night.  I'm a huge fan of maple flavouring and this dessert delivered in spades.  The combination of the warm soft cake with a nice vanilla ice cream was a perfect way to end the night.

Is Le Papillon somewhere that I would go all the time?  No.  Was it a nice place to go for a special meal?  Yes.  It was a fairly memorable meal with good service."}
{"text":"Hidden away in Toronto east, I was hoping that Le Papillon would be a gem that I could use to try to lure my friends into dining in my area.  The restaurant is beautiful, the atmosphere and setup were just gorgeous.  It is unfortunate that the food and service was not up to par.

I booked the reservation through Open Table and came here with a group of 6.  The bread and whipped butter was tasty and went well with the French onion soup that I had.  The French onion soup was delicious and tasted a bit like a gravy, but not too salty like my other French onion soup experiences.  The entrees were not fantasic.  I had a dish that was layered baked vegetable and it was flavourless and tasted under-cooked.  

Seeing the unimpressed expression on my friend's face as well, I asked if she wanted to trade.  She had a brothy meat dish that was interesting in the number of ingredients but was also not impressive.  As we continued to pass around our bland dishes, the only one that was good was the salmon with quinoa but even that wasn't anything fancy.  It was a disappointing experience overall with the servers that took forever to bring out the bill.

Really disappointing, and even more so since it is pricey.  I wish we had gone to The Keg instead."}
{"text":"A perfectly seasoned and cooked steak is hard to come by, especially when you want to keep it under $40. Tonight, we were in pursuit of this holy grail of meaty deliciousness. 

A bit out of the way, our reservations were at 6:30. We were anxious and hungry on our quest after all. Right off the bat as we entered, I noticed the demographic was a little different from the usual downtown crowd. The majority of the patrons seemed to have driven (there is a convenient parking lot), and it felt very suburban. There were a lot of blue hair and flowered blazers. I completely attribute this to our early reservation. 

Friendly staff directed us to our friend who was waiting for us at our table. The décor of the room was very French Canadian, dark wooden beams, white stucco walls, interesting abstract art on the walls. It was almost a cozy cottage atmosphere. Lovely.

We were seated right in the middle of the room, which I usually hate, but the tables were spaced so that the wait staff could move unobtrusively, and we weren't bumping elbows or the backs of our chairs with other patrons. 

Our server attended to us immediately, providing us with our menus and the specials. We ordered a bottle of wine, and our appetizers and entrees. The wine arrived promptly, and our waitress made sure to drape her napkin accordingly over her arm. Bonus points for sure. 

The appetizers followed quickly after. I ordered the Caesar salad-the lettuce was fresh, there was a lemon to squeeze on it, the dressing didn't have too much garlic and was surprisingly light. The parmesan cheese was also fresh, something that is very important for me. There was delightful crispy bread that was brushed with olive oil. My only complaint about my salad would be the bacon bits-it was actually bacon bits-had they used actual bacon the salad would have been a home run.

For my entrée I had the steak au poivre.  This was a massive angus filet mignon with Dijon mustard and a peppercorn sauce. I ordered it rare, and lo and behold.. I got it rare! Yay for me! It was beautifully plated-with garlic whipped potatoes, broiled brussel sprouts, carrots, broccoli, cauliflower, parsnips. There was a little flowery garnish on top of the whole ensemble. However-I hate that classically trained chefs feel the need to pile everything on top of each other. I don't necessarily like all my food touching. It looks nice, but when I'm picking mashed potato out of my broccoli, and trying to decide if a parsnip is a parsnip or an unmashed potato, I'm going to feel a little grumpy. Everything was delicious though. The brussel sprouts were still a little crunchy, and somehow didn't have any bitterness that is associated with underdone sprouts. There was a lot of butter involved, but it just made it that much more decadent. The steak was perfectly seasoned, had a beautiful sear on the outside, and I swear I heard it moo a little as I cut into it. It must have been more than 8 ounces, and I savoured every bite. 

After such a massive meal, we decided to share two desserts between the three of us, and we all ordered sambuca and espresso. As it was getting busier, and the clientele was shifting, the bar was getting slow with the service. Our waitress came over and apologized for the longer wait, which wasn't that bad to begin with, but showed that she obviously cared about the experience she was providing. 

My espresso was just lukewarm. The cup it was in was not one that would retain heat readily, but the flavour was there. The sambuca that came with the espresso had three coffee beans in it, a touch that I don't see that often, is nothing to me but eye candy, but so appreciated. Coffee beans in my sambuca makes me feel special okay?! 

For dessert, we got the \"pouding chomeur\" which is an upside-down cake with a caramel-like sauce (although the menu said it was maple) with vanilla ice cream, and a chocolate fondant with this amazing strawberry sauce. Both were so decadent and rich and light and satisfying all at once. Chocolate and strawberry are like Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively for me.   

Our waitress was attentive, charming, and a little clumsy in an entertaining kind of way. She filled our glasses when they were empty, took away our plates when we were done with them, and left us alone to enjoy our meal. The best service I have had in years. It was very reasonably priced. Due to the location, if you are taking a cab, I would suggest calling for one as you are getting your bill. 

I am definitely coming back to this restaurant, and wish that I had visited in the summer. (Apparently they have an amazing rooftop patio) What a great evening! I'm going to polish this meaty grail and store it on my shelf of noteworthy eateries right after I click post."}
{"text":"A great place for some fine dining without going into the core. A small, elegant space where you get great service, amazing food and fabulous wines. Bring your own conversation."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, brunch is great, and I'm not going to specifically talk about the food because I'm all too happy to eat a slab of melted velveeta on a triscuit... geographically speaking, i think this restaurant is in a fantastic spot because there are very few cool places to go in the beach...yes, they call it leslieville (pushing it) but it's close to woodbine park, the west part of the beach
if you are a married couple, it's the perfect spot to go for an anniversary dinner, and yet it's discreet enough to go with your lover if you are tired of steaming up the car in the parking lot at ashbridges bay.
also if you are going to the beach theatre, it's a great place to go for a post-cocktail to talk about how you really didn't understand the plot of inception... some movies are confusing. the bartender at the papillon makes great martinis."}
{"text":"Not too many French restaurants in the area, especially somewhere decently priced. My Paris born friend who grew up in Montreal made a special request to check out Le Papillon Park. Of course I trusted he knows his French food so we decided to check the place out. 

The place is secluded and isolated in the middle of the boonies. Their business depends greatly from people who knew they're driving to this part of town to the restaurant.  No way you would stumble across Le Papillon Park without knowing where you're headed. Great place for a date night. Dim candle lighting, fireplace, not too noisy. 

We ordered the Onion soup and escargot to start. We were not blown away by the escargot as there was no cheese bakes ontop. The soup on the other hand was pretty damn amazing. It tasted like watery poutine sauce with cheese baked on top.

For entree I had the seafood crepe. It was amazing  but for 23$, I wish there was more than 3 peices of shrimp and 2 scallops."}
{"text":"Being montréalaise myself, I'm sorry to say I was not impressed =(  Was really hoping to get my dose of montreal bagels, cafe au lait or croissant aux amandes. But alas...."}
