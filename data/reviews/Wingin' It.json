{"text":"I am down with trying any new place that seems to serve great food at reasonable prices, even if it IS a fast food location inside a casino. . .and that describes Wingin' It to a tee.  OMG. . .the cajun wings and boatload of tangy fries are out of this world!  The combos are just enough to fill ya up and the selections don't cost and arm and a leg.  The employee/s are cordial and try to get your order out quickly, but don't expect speedy service on the weekends because there is always a line of folks placing orders.  About the only negative thing is their limited seating, but if I'm not gambling in the casino I can take my order home to enjoy.  This is my new \"go-to\" wing place (next to my other favorite. . .Popeye's)."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has only two reviews... it could be because people don't want to be known for visiting the hotel and casino or even admitting to dining here... sort of like saying you visited a strip club in Vegas lol but I have no shame in my game...   First off let me say this place was open late. Service was quick and the two people working were very courteous and friendly. They suggested the bbq/hot wings and I went with it.  Their combo meals come with a large pile of fries seasoned and fried to perfection and a drink.  Not sure who decided that six wings was just the right portion to hit the spot but they were spot on.  The wings were hot, tasty and reasonably priced.   They offer all sorts of condiments and have both tear off paper towels and napkins.   Seating is limited but if you're a hotel guest why not just take your meal back to he room!?   My friend and I were happy with our meals and will definitely return again when in the area.  This place might be called Winging It but they sure don't wing it... With quality you can taste... they're doing it right.   Be back hopefully sooner than later!"}
{"text":"Convenient spot to grab a quick bite after ice skating at SoBe ice arena which is just down the hall from here. Other than that I probably wouldn't recommend coming here as it's just a wing, chicken fingers, and fries joint.   The combos are the best deal here as they come with fries and a drink. Disappointed they only had sodas and not tea or any other drink without added sugar. Food is made to order which takes about 10 min to receive after ordering"}
{"text":"Inside Fiesta casino, get a rewards card and print out a coupon from the kiosk. It's a buy one combo and get one free. We like cajun chicken wings and our favorite place to order this from used to be Mr. Eatz, now the kids prefer Wingin' It. It's spicy, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. It's delicious, great punch of flavor. I bought 2 combos which has 6 wings and fries and ordered an additional 24 chicken wings. My husband and  I took it home and it was gone like that! Unbelievable.   Latoya helped us with our order. Nice, friendly and patient with all the customers."}
{"text":"This is probably some of the best wings I've had, we had a 2 for 1 coupon here and omg I've never tried this place and I was kind of skeptical but at the end the food was absolutely great, the combo is great for only 7 dollars, you get 6 wings or a hamburger, drink and amazing fries, definitely recommend this place for anyone looking to try something new, and one last thing, the buffalo hot sauce was one of the best sauces I've ever had, I wish the had more locations around Las Vegas though."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this place. I ordered 2-6 wing cajun combos and a hot dog combo. I asked for cheese for my fries (me thinking that the cheese would be melted cheddar in small cup containers). Instead, I get the Kraft-like cheese slices. And as for the cajun chicken wings, those didn't taste like anything. Tasted as if they weren't seasoned at all. And to think I waited 20 minutes for that. Never again. You'd do better going to Wing Time, Wing Stop or Voodoo Chicken."}
