{"text":"New name. Same mediocre menu. Same bad service. Open until 2A?? Good luck! The bartender(s) routinely begin to clean up and get ready for closing around 9P on Friday and Saturday nights. Not exactly a welcoming sign to stick around for the evening. Where (or who) is the owner of this place? Do they not pay attention at all? If you have to go...get some wings - expensive, but not bad. Shame..."}
{"text":"This place leaves a lot to be desired!!  One waitress running around yet not keeping any customer happy.  Nothing more than frozen prepared food.  We could not eat the burger, but we're told it came in fresh yesterday.  It had a sour taste.  \"Sorry about your burger bud\" really? Server must be one of the owners....."}
{"text":"They have great wings and awesome sandwiches.  They have a fantastic beer selection of bottles and drafts. Always great food when I go there."}
{"text":"I have attempted to change the name of this location from Johnny's Wife's Place II to Black Sheep with Yelp, to avail at this this point in time. No matter. It is basically the same thing as JWPII. Same owner, same menu, same look, same exact crappy service. 

Stopped in here the other night with fellow yelp friend, Renee. Basically, we just wanted to check it out and see if it was new or just JWPII reloaded. We inquired, and discovered that it is in fact still owned by the same people. (Although, it may be one of those deals where a family / marriage splits and one gets one restaurant, one gets the other. This is what is assume, but still speculation at this point). 

I've reviewed both JWP in Jeannette and this location in Irwin. Both locations have the same food, which is decent and really not the issue. The issue is that the service is poor and has consistently gotten worse. During this last visit, the place was rather busy. Although, my friend offered our waitress an out by sympathizing that they always seem understaffed. Our waitress got a little defensive and said, \"No, there's three of us on, like usual.\" Okay, then why the piss-poor attitude? Then why dropped off our food, practically throwing it on the table, and not asking if we need anything else? A drink refill, maybe? She never came by to check on us or ask how our meals were. 

I ordered a steak salad and asked for more dressing...there's a $.75 charge for that. My dinner pal orders a taco pizza, which doesn't come with salsa or sour cream. We flag her down to ask for salsa. Shocker....there's a $.75 charge for that. When we seem kind of surprised, she states, \"Well, it's not my policy, it's the restaurant's. We don't normally include salsa because there's sauce on the pizza.\" Umm, okay. It's a taco pizza. I think salsa and /or sour cream are kind of a given. 

She brings us the check and I noticed right away it's way too much. Why? Because it's not our check. I mean, it's not even close. There's wings and long island iced teas on the bill. Again, have to flag her down to get the correct check. She mumbles an apology and walks away, bringing the correct check minutes later. 

Overall, just a bad experience. Luckily, the food was fine (the only reason for 2 stars) and we were able to enjoy ourselves just talking and also complaining about our mutual dislike for the service! But will stick to the original location from now on."}
{"text":"I liked it totally.... I think that anyone that has so much time to give a seven paragraph trashing should probably find something productive to do with their life.   YEAH...I LIKE IT THERE A LOT.  and NO!  I do not own or work there."}
