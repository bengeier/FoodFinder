{"text":"I am only giving 4 stars because I have only tried their rice balls and deserts. I have had a great experience every time I have gone. Great staff, great balls, and delicious toppings."}
{"text":"Amazing! Truly delicious, true Italian family recipe. The taste was so delicious, I ordered a tomato sauce container to-go to!!! Staff and service was prompt, excellent and very friendly..feels like you are amongst friends! The arancini balls were beyond this world, sausage sandwich was cooked to perfection. The deep fried nutella dessert...melts in my mouth!  This is my new go to spot for sure! Amazing quality!"}
{"text":"Rice balls and marinara sauce very tasty, although would have preferred a higher filling to rice ratio.  However, contrary to the experiences of some other reviewers, I felt about as far from family as you could get. When I asked about which arancini they had, the counter staff member went through the whole list on the board.  However, when I tried to order, her fellow staff member snapped at me that they only had a couple of the options... which was the point of my original question. They seemed very defensive about the fact that, because they are freshly made, only a subset of the fillings will be available at any given time. That's fine with me.  I just don't appreciate being snapped at."}
{"text":"I ate at this place expecting a great experience... Totally not the case.. The food was decent but the veal sandwich was super thin. I've had many veal sandwiches and this one was like eating a bread sandwich .. Thin slices of meat breaded and placed in an over sized bun.. The rice ball  was good but a Similar experience to another reviewer left me with having to choose what the server told me they had. When I asked for one of the choices on the menu I was Rudely told they did not have that choice available and then asked \"do you want it or not?\" Bottom line.. I don't think the food was worth coming back to deal with the poor service and knowing that I have had better elsewhere I can say I won't miss this place or remember it."}
{"text":"I gave this place a one star because I had to give them a rating. It's Dec 24 I understand, but don't open if you are not going to serve quality food. Veal sandwich was very weak! Thin little piece of veal, and very skimpy on the toppings which I played a lot for. This place should just close!!. Why bother? They didn't even have the variety of rice balls that was recommended by a friend.  That dude owes me a lunch. I recommend you give this place a pass!!"}
{"text":"Veal sandwich was good although the veal was pretty thin.  Good bun though, not too hard and was fresh.  Good assortment of toppings. Beef arancini was also good but huge and very filling,  it could be a meal on it's own."}
{"text":"Love the food!! Delicious sauce arancini and don't get me started on the fried Nutella sandwiches. Very warm atmosphere   Fantastic service and great prices."}
{"text":"Had the veal sandwich. The taste of the sauce & bun was good, although as already mentioned the veal is SO thin! They take \"flattening the cutlet\" to the next level, which essentially leave you with breading between bread...  I would definitely try this place again for the arancini, because it's cute and clean inside!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, great service, we come back over and over again! Such a great spot for a fresh bite of delicious arancini!"}
