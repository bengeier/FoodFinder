{"text":"One of the few Good Latin Food restaurant from the Greater Toronto Area  Great food, quick easy access for people in the East end of the city, to avoid the traffic madness.  *** Update *** Too bad the place closed down, it's no longer there."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great service.   Latin-American food made from the scratch.  I highly recommend it"}
{"text":"El Pulgarcito should be common knowledge to the world.  From the very moment you walk through the door you see a clean spacious environment with two large flat screen tv's for entertainment and quaint handmade napkin holders to adorne the tables.  This place has a really elevated look to it, yet still has the feeling of home.   The staff is really nice and are quite welcoming and sometimes tell stories about people who have tried the food here and really ties the \"home\" feel of this place.  I ordered the Camarones al ajillo which means Shrimps and Garlic.  The large beautifully cooked tiger shrimps were delicious and stunning. Topped with garlic sauce they taste amazing with a hint of sweetness. And the fries were excellent! Warm and crunch to compliment the sweetness. And the fresh salad was delicious and helped make the shrimps not to be overwhelmingly rich.  My dish wasn't that expensive either! It was about $17.00, which is quite average for tiger shrimps in restaurants. But really, they should charge more! These were to good to be true.  I had an amazing experience and will come back for another bite! As you should too!"}
{"text":"I've literally eaten everything on the menu. I love this place since they were on Kennedy. Papusa's are always ordered along with the chicken taquitos."}
{"text":"Pretty awesome food here.  This was my first time diving into the realm of Salvadoran cuisine.  The papusas are really tasty, I pretty much stick to the cheese only one which comes with a sort of tomato water.  I've gottwn the Yucca Frita con chicharrone a few times and the Yucca and Pork are amazing.  You could never eat that every day...you'd simply die! The tacos aren't bad either, a little on the salty side but nice and crispy.  The beef enchilada is also worth mentioning and makes for a nice little meal.  I tried the tamales and realized I'm not a fan of tamales at all, but it might suit your tastes!"}
{"text":"I love this place! They make delicious pupusas for such a cheap price! You can go to this restaurant with less than 10 bucks, and be stuffed by the time you leave. The owner is also very gracious."}
{"text":"I'm salvadorean and I truly enjoyed their food, I was hesitant thinking it wouldn't be legit. But the pupusas are actually pretty good! Thick, filled, and kind of crunchy. I have always liked my pupusas alittle oily. The yuca Frita is good, thick cuts, chicharon is good portion and mix of meat/fat. The tamales are nothing special, if anything lacking. The platano Frito with cream is good, can't really screw up frying plantain. Although you may wait awhile to be served,. Overall I think it's a great salvadorean restaurant serving authentic dishes."}
{"text":"My rating is 3.5/5.  Yelpers should note that this restaurant has moved from its Kennedy/Lawrence location to Birchmount and Sheppard.  Simple and homey El Salvadorian food is the name of the game. I ordered the Jumbo Shrimp in Garlic Sauce. It was quite the revelation. The shrimp were of excellent quality and cooked to perfection. The accompanying sauce was unlike anything I have tried before. Super savory, and delicious. A total home run, especially when mixed into the rice. I am so glad I ordered this.  My friend ordered the Chicken Burrito, and though I was initially skeptical, I was proven wrong. I can honestly say that this is one of the most heart warming and delicious burritos I have ever eaten.  We also ordered a couple of Pork and Cheese Pupusas to round out our order. They were a little on the greasy side. Rincon Latino at Kennedy/Ellesmere has better.  If you are jonesing for authentic Latin food, this is the place to be. Their fridge is stocked with enough Jarritos and Jumex Juices to overcome the fact that there is no air conditioning here.  Service is a tad on the slow side, but the owners are really nice. This is more if a help yourself kind of joint."}
{"text":"Finally a South American joint in Scarborough!  This is not fast food. Good things take time.  And everything here is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Omg!!!!! I got takeout and was soooo happy. Ordered at 6pm to pick it up by 7pm so that I had enough time to get there from north york and also because the other reviewers said the food takes longer than usual at times.  The man who I paid and was cooking in the kitchen is So nice! I think he was working alone at the time so pls don't be rude and impatient. Just drink beer or order ahead if you don't want to wait.  The best club sandwich I ever bad. Tons of creamy mayo cut into the meat. soooo good I wish we got more.  Pupusas were great, much better than the ones I had many times at downsview market.  So good. Especially if you love carbs.  Yuca fried ones w pork so good! I have always loved yuca much more than ordinary potatoes. Chicken tacos, like another reviewer said these are fried tacos. So good.  The food reminded me of my many trips to central america when I would escape the lame family all inclusive resorts and venture out to eat real local food .  I love places like this. Definitely my new favorite.  - thanks! From Japanese girl"}
{"text":"The pupusas were amazing! Just wish they could have chicken or beef in them. This place cooks really good food. We had a meal for 2 on $20 and we were quite stuffed."}
{"text":"My wife and I ordered a pupasa, quesadilla and burrito here. The pupasa was a nice snack. The cheese in the quesadilla was great but it definitely could have included more chicken. The burrito was enormous and the steak inside was very good. It was a pleasant experience overall and was fun to experience new cuisine."}
{"text":"Muy bien. El mejor en cocina de El Salvadorian en Toronto.  Wow what a place.  Decor is not much to look at and could use a little sprucing up but hey you don't come here for fine dining... you come for the food.  Rich aromas invade your nostrils and tastebuds as soon as you enter.  The food is made with love from this wife/husband duo and you can taste the freshness in each ingredient as you bite into the dishes.  We had (but of course! ) the papusa's which were as good if not better then the real thing in El Salvador. The shrimp was fresh, large, well portioned and seasoned to prefection.  We had a chicken tostados dish, the jumbo shrimp and 2 papusas with 6 corona and 2 shots or tequila for $60!! WOW what a deal.  I highly recommend this place to everyone to try and I love the fact that they are right down the street. We will be back over and over again!  We got married on a beach in El Salvador ( to be different then the mainstream jamaica, dr etc etc ) and everytime I come in here I am reminded of that magical moment.  Please come to El Pulgarcito and create your own magical memory of a culinary delight sure to please all your flavourful needs!   MUY BIEN!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is one of Toronto's hidden gems.  The food is incredible and if you haven't tried El Salvadorian food, I highly recommend you try this place."}
{"text":"The fish and the shrimps were alright, everything else such as enchiladas, quesadillas, breakfast, etc. were not good. Service was terrible because it was a bit busy, extremely slow"}
{"text":"I see many amazing reviews on el pulgarcito so I think the day I went was just... bad?  I walked in and didn't know if I wait to be seated or if I seat myself. The food took an hour and thirty minutes to get to my table. I think it's because that day only one person was working front and one lady in the kitchen. The food was alright and he apologized for the long wait...  The only thing was honestly that hour and thirty wait... really? Oh the habanero sauce was, great."}
{"text":"I came here on a Tuesday evening with my sister and her boyfriend. We had been at Panagio's the week before which is located across the street, and happened to notice this place. When we looked it up, the reviews were good so we thought we would check it out.   When we arrived, the place was empty so we were the only diners. We sat down at a table and were given menus and asked for waters for each of us. We looked it over and decided on minced and cheese pupusas, chicken tacos and a chicken tamale. We all really enjoyed the pupusas, the chicken tacos were good, but messy to eat because all the toppings are on top, and my sister said the tamale was just okay. I also loved the chile habanero sauce with the pupusas.  Overall if I were to go back, I would probably stick to an order of tasty pupusas."}
{"text":"We tried their food at their new location at Birchmount and Sheppard. Great experience, loved the horchata, pupusas and especially their chicken burrito. Hadn't had El Salvadoran cuisine in many years and this was just great! They work on only cash or debit, however. Who doesn't have a credit card machine these days? There is a device now that turns your iPhone into a credit card machine for god's sake...well, take some cash and go for the food :)"}
{"text":"Recommended by a coworker well-versed in pupusas, this place definitely lived up to its pupusa fame.   - PUPUSA CON TODO - contains beans, cheese, minced pork. flavour of the masa came through well and a good balance between the three-ingredient filling. definitely will come back for this one - PUPUSA DE QUESO CON LOROCO - contains cheese and herb. akin to a fried mozzarella stick, there was a good \"chew\".   *all pupusas served with a tangy cabbage slaw -- excellent for cutting through the richness and balancing out both flavour and texture.  - YUCCA FRITA - fried yucca wedges with crispy fried pork belly and a light cabbage/tomato/cucumber/radish salad. yucca was well-seasoned and had a baked-potato-like centre. pork belly was fried crisp however as a fried-on-fried pairing, the tangy slaw from above was definitely necessary to bring in some pizzazz.  as i'm writing this now i can feel the effects of the saltiness of everything but nevertheless delicious and will warrant another trip in the future to try out the fried tilapia entree and other pupusa variants. bring your turkey pants (and patience) if you'll be ordering more than the above for 2 diners.   note: it appears that they serve breakfast all day, at an additional charge of $1 after 3PM."}
{"text":"I've never had any other El Salvadoran food so I can't compare it to the other places, but if they're all as delicious as El Pulgarcito, then ¡muy bien!  This restaurant's specialties are the handmade pupusas, a traditional Salvadoran item made of thick, handmade tortillas that are stuffed with various fillings. The pupusas are then cooked on smooth, flat griddles called comals. The ones served at El Pulgarcito offer stuffings of cheese, refried beans, and minced pork, in various permutations, as well as a cheese and herb for vegetarians.  I've been to El Pulgarcito several times in its previous location, with friends as well as family. This time around, we got three con todo (with all) pupusas. All I have to say about these are that they are a todo assault (heh) on the taste buds, combining the strong savoury flavours of the pork and beans with the subtle and gooey cheese, and the clean taste of soft maize enveloping it all.  Also on the menu are the more typical Latin American options such as tacos and quesadillas. To round out our meal, we ordered the nachos with beef. My friend says it's the best nachos she's ever had. While I don't entirely agree, it's certainly got a lot of character and is quite different to the standard nachos you'd find at a Tex-Mex restaurant or sports bar. I was expecting ground beef but it turned out to be medium rare steak, which was cool.  A mom and pop business, the decor is nothing special and clearly not the focus of the restaurant. And that's fine, it's not as though they brand themselves as some kind of high end place. Overall, it gives me a very hole-in-the-wall, dim and dingy feel. Instead, the prices are extremely affordable, and for two people we only rung up $25 after tax and tip with leftover food (we couldn't finish the nachos).   Service: 4/5 Decor: 3/5 Pricing: 5/5 Food: 5/5 Overall: 5/5"}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait for everything. Vegetarians have a small choice while eating here, either breakfast meals or appetizers. That being said, there are quite a few appetizers that are worth trying: yucca fries, nachos, and tamales if you ask for no chicken or pork. We tried all of these and I liked the yucca fries the most.  For entrees I initially ordered a soup. They have 3 choices that are only available on the weekend but at the time only 1 was available and it was meat based so I ordered the tiger shrimp instead - not worth it, there were literally 3 shrimps. 3 people ordered the T Bone (came medium to well done) which was a hefty portion. 2 ordered the fish which came whole and was tasty.  It's an OK place but if you're craving this kind of food and you've got time to kill in the area for a moderate price it'd be a fair choice."}
{"text":"Really good papusas and yuca fries. I also got the enchiladas here and they were also really tasty.   The owner is really friendly and it's a nice atmosphere, definitely recommend if you're in the neighbourhood.  I hear they have moved so keep that in mind."}
{"text":"best pupusas in the GTA! just like back home. yes the owner is a lil slow with the service but the food more than makes up for it. i came all the way from downtown to Scarborough for them!!  try the pupusas, the tamales, yucca frita with chicharron!"}
{"text":"After walking for @5.3 hours at the zoo, I found this place on yelp as I wanted a nice place to try some authentic foods. Firstly they do not take credit cards...secondly, we walked in and it was simply a hole in the wall.  We were greeted with a friendly smile and a menu.  I was intrigued by the pupusas as I have never had them before.  They were absolutely delicious!!  Everything was fresh and delicious.  What a very pleasant surprise.  For some unknown reason, they didn't accept our (US) debit card, but we had enough cash.  While we were locating more cash, even a customer offered to chip in and the owner kept shaking his head that we had paid enough.  It was quite sweet, but we found what we needed as we intended on paying for the amazing meal we had!  And, now that I'm back home in Cincinnati, I had to find pupusas here.  Great find!"}
{"text":"Yummy very good. Come here and eat."}
{"text":"The food here has always been amazing but I think it's gotten even better at the new location.  The papusas  are killer,  burritos are to die for with that queso fresco on top and tomato salsa.  One of our favourite places, period."}
{"text":"We're sorry to see all the average reviews this place has received.  First off, the food is amazing, fresh and made from scratch(which accounts for why it takes so long).  The papusas are to die for with homemade tomato salsa and coleslaw mmmmmmm.  The jumbo shrimp is out of this world, they're covered in a garlic cream sauce and herbs.  Burritos, tacos, quesadillas and steak are all solid and priced very well.  The other treat here is their Yucca Frita, deep fried pork and casava.  We recommend sharing this because it is extremely filling.  I'm not sure what one poster was referring to when commenting on the prices being above average.  The prices here are way below average, you could eat a full meal here for cheaper than a combo at mcdonalds($8.50 for a burrito, beans, rice and salad).   Although the service isn't the fastest and the decor could use some work, the amazing food and friendly owner totally make up for it.   Don't forget to grab a fruit ice bar on your way out (we love the pina colada one). They are made from real fruit with huge fruit chunks and are the perfect dessert to end off a great meal."}
{"text":"Great Papussas!!!   The food is very good and cheap!  only thing they could work on is the customer service, usually have to wait for 5-10 mins just to put in an order.  But it is soo good it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"This is the place to go to for a pupusa fix. Delicious and affordable! Two pupusas can definitely fill you up, and they won't cost you much. I ordered three con todo pupusas - fillies with cheese, beans and minced pork ($3 each). They ran out of tamales, but I came late lunch on a Sunday. While the restaurant is near a busy intersection, it is easy to overlook as you drive by because it is in a dead plaza that no one goes to. The restaurant is not big inside, enough to fit at least 30 people. The owners are very nice people who work hard. They could benefit from hiring more staff as the restaurant was busy. Phone ringing, ordering coming up, customers walking in, dirty tables and dirty dishes lying around, customers having to grab their own drinks, and only one person working the front. Not the best first impression of a new restaurant. At least they make up for it with the food. I do hope they improve service and spruce up the look of the place to brighten and clean it up. But it'll have to do as one of the few Latin food restaurants in the Scarborough area."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food! And if you live in Toronto, you'd know that mexican food is scarce! I live in the suburbs so you can imagine how 'booming' mexican food really is here let alone Toronto!  So you'd imagine how ecstatic I was to find out that there was an actual authentic mexican place in Scarborough!  This place is located a little south, but it was good.. The place is a little dumpy -- but that just means that's it's legit.. (amirite?!)  We ordered 2 Pupusas to start (at $2 each) but they came at the end of our meal unfortunately.  We ordered a Steak Burrito and Chicken Quesadillas (at $8.50 each) and are served with a cucumber tomato and iceberg lettuce \"salad\". The burrito came with rice (that was really salty so we didn't eat it) and a bean past (for dipping?).  All items were a bit too salty for my liking, but it's not too too bad! Its authentic and you know it because if real latin american people come to eat here, then you know its good! and trust me, you can tell they're real latin american people :)  This place is not bad at all! will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"We visited for dinner last week. This is not really my thing. The horchata was a little too sweet. The pupusas was decent but really oily and the beans, cheese and ground meat was all in seperate sections of the pupusas. The yucca fries had potential but in this instance was rather bland but layered with veggies. Sorry El Pulgarcito, I really tried!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely a hidden gem in Scarborough area. It is surrounded by an industrial park and easy to miss if you weren't looking for this place.  We arrived around 3pm to avoid the long waits like many people have mentioned. Upon arriving, no one greeted us, we grabbed a table and menus. The guy working there recommended the pupusas ($3 a piece) and he was right! The pupusas had a crispy exterior and the interior was filled with flavourful ground pork and cheese. The crunch factor and mouthfeel of these pupusas are to die for! We also got tamales and they weren't as great as the pupusas.  I'll definitely return to this place when I'm in the area, be aware that wait times can be long as others have pointed out. When we were there around 3pm it wasn't too bad...approx 20mins for our food to come out."}
{"text":"I was reading the weekly publication The Grid this week and there was an article on El Pulgarcito, the review was positive and I passed by this place quite a few times and thought nothing of it. So after reading the article, I decided to drop by on a Sunday afternoon to see if it warranted the positive review.  Let me tell you, it was a pleasant surprise. Keep in mind it's also difficult to find good Hispanic and in this case Salvadoran cuisine in the east end, since the majority of the Hispanic community live downtown and in the west end and open their businesses in those areas.  Looking from the outside it doesn't look like much and once I entered, soccer was playing on the flat screen televisions, there were a few Hispanic couples and a Hispanic family dining which was a good sign for authenticity.  My partner and I ordered a minced pork pupusa to start ($2.25), the pupusa was nice and light and not oily. It was nicely seasoned and it comes along with a side of coleslaw. I can now see why they are famous for their pupusas.  For the mains, I ordered steak with fries and a salad ($14.00) and my partner ordered chicken tostadas ($6.25). The salad was fresh, and the fries and steak were average, not great but not bad either. The portions were a decent size.  The chicken tostadas were really good, you get 2 tostadas, the tortilla was nicely toasted and fresh, nothing worse was than a stale tortilla. The chicken was shredded and topped with cheese, sour cream, chopped lettuce and diced tomatoes.  I had a pineapple jarrito drink ($1.75) and a fried plaintain ($2.50 for two pieces) to top everything off. The plaintain was nicely done,   It's a family run business with decent service and reasonable prices and great food that's made fresh to order. The food took a bit of time to come out but that's because it's made fresh to order. I would be worried if the food came out too fast because usually that's a sign that it's not being freshly made and the food is just being reheated in the microwave."}
{"text":"El WaYnE fue al El Pulgarcito para el Pupusa.  Escribí en Español pero no sé Español.  Including this visit, I've had less than a handful of experiences with Pupusa but within those rare occasions I've gotten to appreciate them much more than what I initially saw them as.    I've been fortunate enough to have good quality Pupusas at every chance simply because within my observation, they are pretty close to identical except for the Slaw condiment that is.  I've had ones plain, another one with spices to El Pulgarcito's which comes with a couple spoonful of Vinegar that the Slaw was prepared in.  I've found that the Pupusa alone doesn't intrigue but it is when it's combined with the liquidy Tomato Salsa and the Sour Slaw that gives it another layer of depth.  If you want to understand this better, simply add some Sour Slaw or Sauerkraut to a nicely fried Quesadilla.  Tamales de Pollo  -  I've had worst where the Masa was dried that I though it was overcooked Cous Cous packed together.  I haven't had enough authentic Tamales to compare but this one is definitely more consumable with a whole mid-Wing(Flat) stuffed inside the Masa.  This version is wrapped in a green Banana Leaf.  Yuca Frita con Chicharrón -  Yuca Frita were crunchy and as with any properly fried starch, it can be quite fulfilling satisfying.  The Chicharrón is a different variation than the healthier Lean Pork version I've had previously but this one is personally better because it doesn't feel like I swallowed a ROCK.  The Chicharrón composition had a 50/50 combination of Pork Rind to Meat but it still tasted quite oily.  There was no initial crunch(sad) but there is that crumbling texture that leads to that oily mouthful.  I'm definitely a Pork Fat type of person so I think a few Friends can lead me to some of their more preferable Chicharrón hot spots."}
{"text":"Best pupusas ever food always hot and fresh the new location looks great love their yucca fries"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews El Pulgarcito was definitely on my radar of places to try.  Relatively new this place is located in a sketchy plaza, however I find the best food are located in places you least expect. The inside El Pulgarcito is nothing fancy, but one thing is for sure the food smell delicious in here.  Mauricio, the sweet gordito amistoso jefe who takes care of the front keeps with the help of family cooking in the back brings back memories of traditional casita, sodas where passerby's would stop by for a quick and delicious home meal.  They've got a good selection of dishes here including all day breakfast which is great, however we were here for the following: Yucca frita: Sliced Fried yucca served with pieces of fried/crispy chincharon (pork) and salad.  Pupusas con todo: $3 a piece, handmade tortillas fried and stuffed with beans, minced pork, cheese  Pupusas con chincharon y queso: Pork and cheese.   I'm so glad to have this place close to home, we need more Latin restaurants in the East end as the majority of them are out in the west-end."}
{"text":"First, this is NOT ON KENNEDY. It's on Birchmount just south of Sheppard. I think someone else mentioned this before me.  So you walk into this place and you look around and your first reaction is, this place could use a bit of a makeover. The man behind the bar tells you, take a seat, anywhere. So you do.  Thank goodness you sit down because there are a few gems here to try. Many people mention the Papusa and they are right. you gotta try it. The guy behind the bar runs the show here and he highly recommends the pork and cheese. You say you want the pork and he'll probably suggest pork and cheese. It is good.  I had the tilapia, large size. And this is not something to be taken lightly as it's a big fish so if you're eating it alone you ought to have a big appetite. It's easily shareable as that's what I did.  They also have this pork rind with yucca fries. These yucca fries are awesome. But the pork rinds, don't be fooled, there is hardly any pork on this thing. This thing is pure fat. Definitely an acquired taste.  So back to the man behind the bar. He does the bills, takes the orders, brings the food. This man does it all! And all with a big smile on his face. Come to say hi to this man, he's an El Salvadorean delight!"}
{"text":"Just went yesterday Our very first time the area isn't the nicest place and the restaurant itself is kind of outdated. But we read about this place on a few articles and me being the Latin American foodie I had to go.  My boyfriend had the jumbo shrimp entree ($16) we both had pupusas pork and cheese (2.75) and I had the enchilada chicken ($9) and with the recommendation of someone eating at the restaurant we had plantain.  My enchiladas were amazing and very unique with a hard shell the chicken was slightly on the saltier side but not bad. The pupusas were amazing. The jumbo shrimp were just heavenly. The sauce on it was a garlic sauce flavour that I've never had before. And to end everything off the plantain were a fabulous dessert. All in all we paid $40 with tip we had take out and I can't wait to go back again! It's close to where I live and we are just lacking in amazing Latin American foods in Scarborough!"}
{"text":"It's a shame this place is located in a derelict industrial plaza. Otherwise, I would expect this place to be booming on a nightly basis.  I gave this place a try a few weeks ago on a Saturday evening. It was completely empty, but I ordered the chicken tacos, the pork and cheese pupusa, and the bean and cheese pupusa. This was my first time trying El Salvadorian food, and it was amazing. The coleslaw that came on the side was an added bonus. Had a great chat with the owner too. I would highly recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I tried the Horchata (rice based drink), the cheese, cheese & loroco, bean & cheese pupusa. I also tried the Veggie enchiladas. Everything I tried was horrible, if you really want pupusa- try the bean & cheese ( this was the best out of everything I had). Bad service, they didn't even bring us our water until the end of the meal. If you really want authentic El Salvadorian food, go to the southern part of the States."}
{"text":"First off, don't be scared off by the look of the plaza. It looks super sketchy, really run down and slightly abandoned, but the short walk from the empty parking lot to the restaurant is well worth it! The restaurant itself is clean, tidy and run by one man who is the waiter/cashier/explainer of menu.  The moment I saw pupusasas on the menu, I knew what I was having. Each one is just $3 and it comes with a side of briny coleslaw cut through all the cheese. I picked a pupusasa con todo (minced pork, cheese and beans) and a pupusasa de queso con loroco (cheese with a type of herb). Each are the size of a teacup saucer, fried until they are perfectly golden crispy without being greasy. The thin tortilla casing holds plenty of filling and each one has a unique taste and texture. The Con todo is a definite must try. The filling is a thick meat paste due to the mashed beans, but it has an amazing depth of flavor. If you like fried cheese sticks or mozzarella, I would recommend the Queso con loroco which strings up as you cut through it. The cheese isn't too overpowering in flavor, so the texture is the main draw of the dish. Looking forward to trying the other menu items!"}
{"text":"These guys rely on the quality of their food and not so much their customer service. They don't say hello or anything. Lol.   The pupusas are fantastic and pretty big. Very filling and juicy.  I'll come again. I don't really care about being pampered. However if you wish to be treated like royalty this place is not for you."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times before- having tried a bunch of the menu items. The pupusas are good- different varieties of cheese, beans and meat options - served with a tart and vinegar based slaw and a tomato sauce - what a combination of flavours! It's a good item to order a couple of different ones and share.    I've also tried the burrito, the tostadas and the tamales - all delicious, and the salad on top is always so crisp and refreshing!   I went for take out this time, and decided to try the jumbo shrimp, which I had always seen people order, but never myself. What took me so long?! It was FANTASTIC! You get 3 Jumbo shrimps which are cooked just right with this rich garlic sauce. It was so delicious! The meal was served with a side of rice, and a crisp salad of lettuce, cucumbers and tomatoes. Everything complimented each other so well.  I don't think I can order anything but the shrimp when I'm there now. The price of the shrimp dish was $16  The only thing is - the service can be slow. It's probably a maximum 3 person operation there - but the man in front is so polite and nice! And with shrimp this good - I can wait!"}
{"text":"The Papussas are amazing!!! Great service! Can't wait to come back and try more of what they offer!! :)"}
{"text":"Ordered the quesadillas filled with chicken, two cheeses and vegetables. Served hot and accompanied with dipping sauce and sour cream. The portions were of good size. The food was tasty, fresh and VERY AUTHENTIC. it was like being in Sam Salvador! Try this place. You'll love it!"}
{"text":"Other than waiting 45 minutes for 4 Con Todo pupusas and a Quesadilla, the food was delicious. I'm not mad about it because there was only one person working the kitchen. They noticed I was waiting so long, so they gave me fried plantain with sour cream on the house. That too was very yummy. Will still go again!"}
{"text":"Awesome pupusas! I think at El Pulgarcito they have more filling in them, on average, compared to other places I've been. The menu here is pretty extensive - definitely more than a pupuseria.  I had two pupusas for lunch, and my bill came to $5.09! What a deal!!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite snack spots. The papusa con loroco must be tried. I used to go when this place was on Kennedy.... Only found it again by chance ... Good honest family cooked food."}
{"text":"This casual Salvadoran is one of the better options for Latin American food in the GTA.  We decided to check it out since we wanted something other than Asian food for a change. The strip mall where the restaurant is located was a bit shifty, and there weren't any other customers inside, and they were playing a show about a murder case on the TV, so we were a bit apprehensive at first... But neither of us died, and we got delicious food to boot!  The star of the show were the pupusas. A pupusa is just a corn flour tortilla filled with various different innards and cooked on a griddle - it's kind of like a quesadilla, but much much better. Mine was filled with cheese, beans, and pork, and it was delicious. We also got a tamale (also delicious) and fried plantains (great for dessert).  Overall, we both enjoyed the great food for a very reasonable price. El Pulgarcito is the perfect solution for any of your Latin American cravings!"}
{"text":"I don't ever recall having authentic Latin American cuisine to compare the dishes we tried, but I would come back for their pupusas, horchata and maybe the tamales. It's a very hole-in-the-wall kind of place w/ minimal/slow service, yet it feels acceptable and adds to the authenticity."}
{"text":"This is the best Salvadorean food restaurant in Toronto. I am Salvadorean and from my previous experiences around Toronto, this is a wonderful and maybe the only place with good quality pupusas. The Horchata is good and I highly recommend the pupusas \"Con Todo.\" However, there are also other options in the menu like tamales or platanos con frijoles y crema.   The service is very kind, super kind. You might have to wait for a while thou, but its worth the wait. Finally, the total check sums up to $24 between two people and I still bought to go.   Other relevant information:  The parking is free. Closed on mondays.  They open until 9pm everyday but monday.  The ACTUAL address is: 2260 Birchmount Rd not 1210 Kennedy Rd. The place is easy to find.  Its quiet and mellow.  Price is cheap in comparison to restaurants in Toronto."}
{"text":"El Pulgarcito serves some of the finest Latin American food you can find in Toronto. Owned an operated by a laid back, quiet man who is quite friendly and welcoming, this is the place you want to go to try things you've never had before. You'll feel like you're a guest in someone's living room while you wait for the food to be prepared.   Salvadorian and Mexican cuisine are the focus of the menu, so don't come here expecting what you might find at a typical taqueria. Probably the best thing about El Pulgarcito is the prices on most items. For under $4-5, you can try everything from platanos, to tamales. My personal favourite here is the bean & cheese pupusas. Just two of them seem to fill up so much space in the tummy.   Overall, this spot is a nice getaway from the usual grub that's out there. So, if for no other reason, you should check 'em out.  Note: If upbeat latin music and slower than average service isn't your thang, you may wanna avoid this gem."}
{"text":"I will always remember El Pulgarcito!   This is where I have my first experience with:  - Salvadorean food  - Pupusas ($2) - Tamarind soft drink ($2) - Yuca Fritta Chicharron ($8.50)  I have to say I have an enjoyable experience... and find them all quite tasty.. since I have nothing to reference to and the food on it own were A-OK.   I could not comment on Tamales de Pollo ($4) since being a nice Yelper, I divided it up in equal portions and ended up mine have no Chicken at all but just dough.. which I cannot really comment on...   The Chicharron is deep fried fatty pork.. quite crunchy and I can believe that it will go well with a beer... but not really my usual diet.. and I don't think I will be eating that too often! The Yuca Fritta though oh that is tasty.. really lightly battered and have a great light taste!   The owner server though a big guy, he is so nice and soft spoken... and have nice handwriting... the receipt was printed in perfect small handwriting! Much better than mine.. which I tease him then he turned red! :)   The hot sauce on the table tasted great! Especially that green one... but I wondering why none of the items on the menu are spicy hot but then there are 2 different kind of hot sauces for you to add on?? Just wondering....."}
{"text":"Pupusas Pupusas Pupusas and More Pupusas!  I think that's the only item I wanted to eat when I visit El Pulgarcito! Here you would find the most authentic pupusas which is a a traditional Salvadoran dish. I just love the simple and rustic taste. Highly recommend the one with cheese inside... oh so gooey gooey cheese. Make sure you eat them with curtido (lightly fermented cabbage slaw with red chilies and vinegar) and some tomato sauce.  Since they are made when order, it would take 15 minute or so to have them ready. But they are just so fresh!!  El Pulgarcito is really casual and family owned. Seat yourself, Go grab your own drink, pay at the cashier when you ready to go...  Worth checking out!!  Btw, I like the new location a lot better than the previous location. A lot more parking and more spacious!"}
{"text":"Recently reallocated from its former Birchmount Road location, El Pulgarcito took over the space that used to be an Indian restaurant.  We dined here last Saturday, just 1 day after its reopening for business  The place was not totally ready, as the old light-box menu of previous business were still on display.  The furnishing was pretty bare, with tables and chairs only.  Never mind that, as we came for food.  We ordered a quezadilla ($11) and an enchiladas ($8).  Both were wonderfully made from scratch, and tasted decent and home made.  The ingredients were very fresh.  This shouldn't be a surprise when the restaurant was reopened just yesterday.  What was a bit of a let down was that both items were served at room temperature.  I didn't know if this was an El Salvador way; but I thought both dishes were supposed to be served warm.   I understand that they are new, so they haven't hired any help.  But we were not offered or given water.  Not even asked if we wanted to order any beverages.  Kind of lacking in services if you ask me.    Then again, when we chatted the owner up, he appeared genuinely friendly.  I am confident that the services will improve once the place is in smooth operating mode.  Because for a business just reopened for 2 days, with no advertising, and Google announced online that the business was permanently closed (an error of course), we were not the only customers finding our way here.  There was another family of 6 dining in, and a gentleman ordering take out.  In short, El Pulgarcito has a loyal following."}
{"text":"This is a great Latin America food restaurant. Gone here often. Just found out today the birchmount location has closed. There is mention of a relocation, but no address is given.  It is quite sad to see them leave, my family really enjoyed their food over the years."}
{"text":"The IT spot for El Salvadorian food!! The owner is a very sweet man, with a great cooking staff. My friends and I have been loyal customers for years!  Don't let the restaurant's appearance trick you, they have great food! Best pupusas in town, and I've gone to quite a few places. I mainly go for the pupusas, but their tacos and other dishes are great too! And inexpensive.  The new location's bathroom is a little creepy though. Downstairs in the some what empty-dark basement."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good. Everything is made fresh and are full of flavor. The only reason why this is only a 3 star rating is due to the lacking of service. If you have 2 hours to spare than this place is excellent.   We got the tacos, the quesadilla, papusa and tamale.  The tacos were not your traditional tacos that are tortilla shells folded in half, they were actually closed off resembling the shape of a rolled crepe and the additional toppings such as lettuce and cheese were put on top over the tacos. They were good, but if you're looking for your traditional tacos these are not it.   The quesadilla was alright. The house made sour cream was absolutely delicious, it was more like a thick salty cheese sauce. And the salsa that came with it was definitely store bought resembling tostitos salsa.   The papusa were delicious. We got the pork, cheese and bean papusa and it came out hot and fresh. The hot sauce that came with it was also wonderful. The cheese inside the papusa was chewy and full of stringiness.   The tamales were also alright. They came out hot and fresh except there was a lot more corn than filling which made it only okay.   Overall, I would come back here to try something else on the menu if I wasn't super hungry to start off with. From the moment of stepping inside the restaurant and getting a menu it's about a 15 minute wait, and then getting your order through is another 15 minute wait. The server also doesn't tell you that drinks are self-serve, we just looked around us and assumed that you're supposed to go up yourself and pick a drink. They don't offer water at the table. Waiting for the food to come to the table well that's about another 40-45 minutes of waiting time. The entire dining experience took almost 2 hours. Hopefully, the service will be better the next time around, but if the food wasn't good, we wouldn't come back again."}
{"text":"Came back 2 days ago and had to update my review because while i previously gave it a 4 it has definitely moved up to a 5  now since service has gotten much faster since I reviewed this place last. Food is excellent! Fresh! Authentic!... my most fave spot to eat Latin food in Toronto and never fails to satisfy every single time. Must try spot!!!"}
