{"text":"What a great evening- thanks to Corey & great food! We really enjoyed everything- from appetizers to dessert! Perfect night!"}
{"text":"Hmmm.  Well.  Have dined at Choplins quite recently... excellent service and food.   Also very good portions .. 

The Steak Valet I found via a Yelp search.    And ordered French Onion Soup ... Filet, Ribeye, and a steak salad...   all were excellent... truly restaurant experience at home...  yes it costs a few bucks but worth it..   

Delivery was delightful... when being lazy again and having an appetite to take us to a top restaurant will order again...

Well done ...

Try it......

Regards

{"text":"Food made with Love the Chef comes out to see how you like the food. They suggested an amazing wine to pair with my meal. Thumbs UP!"}
{"text":"We will definitely order delivery from here again!  Delicious, juicy, tender, perfectly cooked ribeye steak,  the shrimp cocktail had 8 tastey, jumbo shrimp, chilled to perfection, with cocktail sauce with just the right amount of horseradish mixed in.  The BBQ chicken breast had a subtle chargrill flavor with the BBQ sauce.  The salad was fresh and plenty with heirloom tomatoes and the baked potato was perfectly cooked and warm.  The people were friendly and customer service oriented.  Great job!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious. However quite expensive to be served on paper tablecloths. I was not pleased w/ the way I was handed a straw when requested. It was handed to me unwrapped by hand. We were very displeased with the way the bill was figured. We had a groupon and KNOW to tip on the full amount of food ordered. However, they automatically added a 20% tip to bill. Plus to top it all the tip was figured on food and taxes. The taxes are NOT to be figured into the tip. Resented having to pay 20% for the service we got. Most groupons ask for 18%. Service was ok but not 20% ok. Sorry we did not refuse to pay that much. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Always enjoy.  You can't  go wrong here!  I love everything I try here.  Steak is always tender and cooked just right."}
