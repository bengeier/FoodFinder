{"text":"In a word...\"whimsy\"...no I am not flaking out.  If you order that, the chef will surprise you with something of their own creation.  I am always game for a culinary adventure!

I was not disappointed.  I got a bed of carrot puree, topped with a tomato pie, basil shrimp, a couple of pieces of fried pimento cheese (gooey yumminess), and bacon.  That was a flavor extravaganza.  I am not sure I would ever have ordered it, but now that I had it, I enjoyed it.

The staff was friendly and attentive.  I think I had four different team members check on me.  

The atmosphere is low-key, and ideal for a nice lunch!  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Surprise find in downtown Monroe.  Small but clean and classy style.  Great looking food and impressive beer selection.  I had the Pork Belly sandwich, reminded me of a Bahn Mi.  My only critique is a few more of the veggies on the sandwich and maybe a little bigger.  I wanted more!  The chips that came with it were very tasty and light.  I wish they had a smaller version of their salads to add to the meal.  They looked amazing."}
{"text":"Delicious! Warm and friendly with super fun atmosphere. Great for business meetings or hanging out with family and friends. Our late lunch made our day!"}
{"text":"Stone Table quite possibly has the best shrimp and grits I've ever tasted.  And the cupcakes are moist and delicious.  I'm not sure if they're sourced from a bakery somewhere, but they're great. 

The atmosphere is casual, the service warm and inviting.  Stone Table has a new fan."}
{"text":"I was surprised and excited to see such a trendy place in downtown Monroe NC. I had the marinated BLT and it was delicious."}
{"text":"I had the warm cabbage salad - it was everything I never knew I wanted. The server was super nice (and I got some free chips!), the food was varied and the desserts were great. Try the bacon donuts!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Everything I have tried is outstanding. They truly care about the quality of their food, and are very creative with the menu.

Try the Marinated Tomato BLT, and be sure to save room for the Maple Bourbon Bacon Doughnut for dessert."}
{"text":"In town for training and decided to try this local place. Very small, decent price and great food.  Had the pork sandwich and hand cut fries. Excellent choice."}
{"text":"Do u have to give it a star? 
Pricey $, Plain food, Low budget ambiance
Got the special since I'm new and you can't go wrong right? Wrong! Should have known better when the menu says \"beef\", no particular cut...I was embarrassed to have to use a napkin for the stuff I couldn't chew!"}
{"text":"Visiting town for a wedding. Stopped in here and was pleasantly surprised to see a great spot with good food offerings. I had the chicken salad sandwich and French press coffee. The coffee was proper temperature and full bodied. I was impressed. The chicken salad sandwich had an ample amount of food with fresh pita chips on the side! Overall, impressed. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Matthew Sganga has been wowing Monroe with his cooking for a long time now. If you are in the region, you owe it to yourself to check out the Stone Table."}
{"text":"I had a great bowl of chicken soup (I was nursing a cold) and the best grilled cheese sandwich in my life! The bread was exquisite. My husband loved his burger. The only downer was the very loud live music. An amp was definitely not needed in that size room. We sat outside to enjoy the evening. But I definitely recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Love love love.  The staff is always so pleasant and the food is always wonderful. Stone table is such a wonderful addition to downtown Monroe."}
{"text":"Glad to see them open again in a new location. My friend had the hot roast beef sandwich and I had the chicken salad sandwich. We both had fries. Everything was delicious. We'd love to go back and try more dishes off the menu."}
{"text":"As good as the Yelp reviews are this place was even better! The hamburger with pimento cheese was delicious as were the fries. Cute place and wonderful, helpful people working there. Five stars for sure"}
{"text":"Delicious lunch with mom. Her shrimp and grits and my \"Whimsy\" where you don't know what you will get. The chef decides by looking at you what to make. He kinda nailed it!"}
{"text":"I would eat here every day if I could -- And I go pretty far out of my way for the food at Stone Table. Monroe needs more places like this. They do traditional/simple dishes but tend to add one or two ingredients that make it surprising  and refreshing -- definitely one of the best in the Charlotte area.  Wish they were open on weekends though..."}
{"text":"Incredible food and service! The steak salad was out of this world! I highly recommend this restaurant for a casual lunch with friends and family."}
{"text":"I just recently relocated here from San Antonio, Tx and I originally found Stone Table here on yelp. I did not make a reservation but the hostess was able yo squeeze me in, with was very much appreciated. The decor was very modern and fitting of the restaurant, and the pictures on the wall definitely caught my attention. They write the menu in the wall (they have paper menus too), which I really like local places that are willing and able to do that. Now, as far as the food! I ordered the SHRIMP and GRITS and it was suggested that I have a salad with my meal, excellent recommendation. The salad had a delicious bite to it and the home made cheese they serve with the salad is outstanding, but the main course (the SHRIMP and GRITS, oh my goodness, all I can say is AMAZING! This place is a diamond in the rough and I usually don't give high reviews like this, but if you get a chance, check out STONE TABLE in Monroe, you will not be disappointed. I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Nice little place, was in town for work and this place came up and the reviews are right. Glad I had time to stop in.  Fresh, fresh, fresh is a good way to describe the food, not just my food but everyone's around me.  I had the pimento cheese burger with fries. Cooked to order, next time I will try something different because a few dishes around me looked amazing.  Hope to be back soon."}
{"text":"Dinner was awesome! Highly recommend. They catered to special dietary needs. Can't comment on breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"I can't praise this restaurant enough!  It is perhaps my favorite.  Everything is good!  The hamburger with truffle fries was the first thing I tried.  They grind their own beef.  The burger was a generous 8-ounce patty with a topping of pimento cheese, onion strings, etc., and it is cooked to order  -  just great.   The shrimp and grits are delicious with a sauce that has a real kick.  The meat loaf sandwich had lots of flavors going on.  The Stone Table really took a meat loaf sandwich to another level.  

I think one of their most popular items is the pork belly sandwich.  While it is good and has a lot of flavors, it is the least favorite of all the things I have tried.  The desserts are homemade and delicious.  

The staff is exceptionally friend and helpful.  I try to arrive after 1PM, because the place can become very busy and seating is limited."}
{"text":"Let me begin with....this restaurant isn't going to be for everyone. If you aren't the adventurous type it might be a little much for you. However, if you are adventurous then swing by and check them out. Menu changes daily and is served family style. What you see on the menu is what you get. By the end of the four courses I was full to the brim and can't wait to come back for round two. Amazing customer service....we didn't have reservations and they weren't going to send us away without feeding us first. Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in the Charlotte/Monroe area. A definite must try!! You won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"Once again, we ate at Stone Table and they NEVER disappoint! I love the decor, the food, the service, and the people. Today, Mr. T and I both had their fish tacos - made with trout.  Good Lord, were they ever good - and quite filling."}
{"text":"My family and I were starving after doing some blueberry picking at a nearby farm. I found Stone Table on Yelp and decided to give it a try. 

When we arrived I was skeptical, despite the reviews. They had an empty dessert refrigerator and there were only 2 groups of people seated at tables. 

Nevertheless, we ordered the shrimp po boy,  the roast beef po boy, and the grilled cheese. I don't remember the exact total, but it was reasonably priced. 

After a short period of time our food came out. The po boys were present open face. They tasted fantastic and hit the spot. I also had a taste of my daughter's grilled cheese. I don't think I've had a better grilled cheese. 

While we were eating an additional 3 groups arrived and the place started to fill up. 

Also, the staff was very nice and accommodating. 

I would totally eat here again."}
{"text":"This place is really popular.  We got here after 1 on a Tuesday and people never stopped coming through the door.  They were running quite low on selections but the menus was fun and the food seemed fresh.  Suggestion - stock up on a broader selection of cool sodas to match everything else in the place.  Totally enjoyed my meatloaf sandwich with pita type chips (though only comes with 3).  Had ordered the onion rings which were amazing.   Deserts were tasty and we enjoyed the experience.  Place has cool vibe, staff wants to please and you just have to like this place.  I could have given it a lower score for running out of multiple menu items - but think about it - they ran out because they are good and fresh.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"A 5 star review means a LOT from me and boy does this place deserve all 5 and then some for their hospitality, farm to table freshness. 

My family and I stumbled across this place leaving my daughter eye sugary appointment. I searched breakfast/ brunch on Yelp and this jewel came up so we headed over. Lucky for us the place had just opened & only had one customer inside. Upon entry we immediately noticed the blackboard of specials and other goodies which attracted our eye. Also at the same time in my peripheral I noticed the cakes and treats on the counter.

My husband and I both opted for the shrimp and grits and my teenager had a burger with fresh cut fries. Unknowning to us the fries are more of a lunch item however the nice lady taking our ordered didn't make mention she just informed us that they would take about 35 mins because they recently opened and all the potatoes needed to be cut.

The shrimp and grits was extremely flavorful and presented in an amazing way. It had heat (spice) as well as flavor. We also had the watermelon fresco for our drink and boy can I tell you it was extremely refreshing and tasty. Fresh watermelon, mint, sparkling soda of some sort in a tall glass of greatness. On the way out I had to do it I had to try one of the fresh desserts and I opted for the strawberry cake which was moist and amazing. Our teenage loved her burger she said it taste so fresh. We look forward to going again soon."}
{"text":"Update: GLUTEN FREE PEEPS: They make their own house baked GF bread here now and you can sub it in any sandwich. Tried it on a grilled cheese. Best damn grilled cheese I ever tasted, gf or not. They sell the gf bread by the loaf too. 

I attached a pic of my $5 large French press coffee. Such a lovely presentation with the sugar shot glass ! Best coffee deal in town too. It's amazingly good quality coffee too

If you are in Monroe & want to eat gourmet cuisine, the only place you will truly get that inspired-chef experience is Stone Table. Shrimp & grits always on point here. Everything is, really. Highly suggest the \"whimsy\" plate, which is whatever the chef decides to feed you. I just wish they were open for dinner !!!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! First off they locally source their food which is a great bonus. The staff is super friendly and gave great suggestions. The lady at the counter suggested he turkey wrap, which may sound boring but it was fantastic! It had bacon, peppers, goat cheese and some orange marmalade. Holy crap, it was awesome!! I will definitely be stopping in again when we pass through. 

I almost forgot to mention they have a huge dessert selection and the bacon glazed donuts are delicious!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Great environment. Reasonably priced. Friendly staff and owners. We had the beef pimento cheese sandwich.  Outstanding sandwich. Hidden onion ring inside the sandwich was a very nice touch. Fries were excellent as well.  The attention to detail it's very rare to find at this price point.  Really nice to have infused healthy water at no extra charge (ask the waitress about there water). The food rivals many five star restaurants.  The chef is just naturally gifted with culinary skills.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We had a very enjoyable lunch last week. We brought our dog and eMate outside. WhT great food and atmosphere. Will be back."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic and the staff very friendly. I had the cheese and potato skins sandwich. It sounded great and tasted even better. Thanks for the great lunch guys."}
{"text":"Amazing everything. Shrimp and grits was delicious. Turkey wrap was amazing. The carrot cake was so amazing. That cup cake was memorable. I had to take one to go.  super satisfied."}
{"text":"I went to Monroe for the first time today and went to this wonderful restaurant! This restaurant is soooo amazing,I got the warm cabbage salad and it was so flavorful and mouth watering. The owners of the restaurant are so incredibly sweet and have great customer service. Even the way they served there water was even pretty. I will be coming back all the time!"}
{"text":"My trusty yelp app mixed with a well written specials board drew me in.  Nice atmosphere, great central location and damn good food.

I had some time to kill while in town and this seemed like a great place to do it.  Lots of great options as far as food goes.  Breakfast, juices, open faced toast, sandwiches etc....  I wanted something a little more filling so I went with the shrimp and grits.  Plenty of shrimp, super creamy grits with a hot sauce flavor to it.  It even had some fried tortilla chips to add a little crunch to it.  $10 was quite fair for that dish.

I don't think I would drive to Monroe to eat here, but I'll be back next time I'm around."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast and service. Quaint spot with quiet atmosphere. You can even talk to each other. Highly recommend for breakfast haven't tried lunch. Great attention to detail"}
{"text":"This was overall a great breakfast experience. The food was delicious and nicely seasoned. We ordered taco of the day, shrimp and grits, as well as steak and pimento sandwich. The best thing was definitely the almond butter and maple coffee, sounds weird, but the taste is amazing. The staff was friendly, food came out fast. 
The only things I didn't really like was ordering at the counter, and the interior design - the space felt too big and not cozy. Also, we ordered their bread pudding, and were told they were out right before it was supposed to come out. So instead we got a cheesecake apple crumble, which was very decent. 
With that being said, I would definitely like to come back and try more things."}
{"text":"This place was phenomenal. The cashier was super helpful - helped us pick out both of our meals. The shrimp and grits was just a bit spicy and delicious, and the turkey wrap with goat cheese was over the top delicious. Especially like the homemade tortilla chips served with both meals."}
{"text":"Great environment. Friendly staff. Charming and unique setting. Food was thoughtfully made and the recipes for all the items are different but amazing. I had the new turkey wrap with walnut mayo, caramelized onions and a side of the pumpkin spice sweet potatoes fries (omg) so so good. Give those fries a try!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Definitely a diamond in the rough. I ordered the warm cabbage salad and the special beef and potato soup and both were absolutely delicious. The service was wonderful and Sharon was so sweet. No doubt that I will be back!"}
{"text":"Awsome!! food, on the pricey side but the shrimp and grits are well worth it."}
{"text":"The pork belly sandwich was one of the best sandwiches we've ever had. The chai tea is also delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is great! We had the griddled pimento cheese and the grilled cheese of the day which was doughnut, bacon and cheese! It was fabulous! The French press coffee was perfect for two to share the the staff are so kind! Would definitely recommend! We will be back!!(from Salisbury NC)"}
{"text":"Love Stone Table and the owner Matthew and family and friends who work there.  Seeing the postings of the food combinations makes me salivate in anticipation for the next time we visit.  Lovely people and love the locally sourced incredients."}
{"text":"Food was served hot and quick.   Something different but funky in the small town.  Would love to see a larger venue but that will come with time.  The chalk wall is interesting but makes ordering fun.   Clientele acted like they never seen a person of differ ethnicity when I went.  Only thing that made me uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Best Shrimp & Grits ever!  The service is excellent, friendly, warm, helpful. The burger and fries are super delicious!  Funky cool atmosphere. Excellent wine and beer selection. Great date place or business lunch or take the kids. Local produce and meats. 
Eat here!!"}
{"text":"There's absolutely no question that this is the best place to get food in all of Charlotte. It was voted best restraunt in Charlotte and it's actually in Monroe!!

I would recommend one of three things:

The special
The carnivore whimsy
The vegetarian whimsy

The first is different every day and the second two are different every time you order them.

Be sure to come here early if you want to heat the lunch rush."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place! From the food to drinks to the service. The staff took such great care of us. Darnell made sure we had enough coffee and drinks and food to feed the whole table. He even went out of the way to let us try new items since it was our first time! My favorite was the fried pickles and warm cabbage salad and of course the butter coffee! I would highly recommend this place to all my friends and family!"}
{"text":"Wonderfully nondescript place. Cheeseburger was good, pimiento cheese sandwich is not what your grandmother made - Generous portions, fresh, made in-house and delicious. Good staff and service fantastic day date with my bride!

And the bread - wow. Made in-house and amazing!!"}
{"text":"Had the stone table burger and fries, very tasty. Grilled bun with pimento cheese spread and onion ring on top of a perfectly grilled patty. Fries dusted with shredded cheese go a long way with some malt vinegar. Can't wait to try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"Great food and interesting menu items as well... healthy or hearty.... Friendly Service,  lots of beer choices .  Seemed unlikely for downtown Monroe, NC  Glad it's there will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic!  I had a wonderful lunch. The staff were all helpful and so nice.  We hung around just chatting for awhile, and after a conversation with the chef, he let me try an unusual combination...a grilled Peanut Butter Jelly & Goat Cheese sandwich.  So creative, and amazing.  Get it with a shot of milk and dunk it in there.  Sounds gross, but it was out of this world!"}
{"text":"Cute restaurant in the middle of downtown.  Loved their kale salad and fruit/veggie infused water.  Vegan options available."}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try Stone Table for months and finally went today for brunch. I chose the Shrimp and Grits.... aah-mazing, very happy tastebuds and belly. I love that in addition to it being delicious, I am also supporting a local restaurant and locally grown food. Also was very pleased with the coffee and infused water (strawberries, oranges, mint and rosemary). Definitely will be going back and don't have to drive to Charlotte to have awesome food which is a huge plus!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, my first sample was when they participated in the International Food Festival at PRMS. heard more about them and decided to try it out while running errands. Wow, great food, decent prices, all home made. They also use a service to deliver!! I had deviled egg and shrimp salad on buttered and toasted bread, with home made pita chips and a side of pork belly. Took the shrimp and grits to go, very good, creamy with a heated kick to it courtesy of what tasted like buffalo sauce. Shrimp was very fresh and grits cooked well. Took home a vegan lemon bar and pumpkin tarte with caramel sauce, candied walnuts and whipped cream. Amazing!!! Will definitely recommend them. Going to add a picture of their little print out for Dinner to Go. Worth a visit, small seating inside and a few tables outside, with a water fountain and shaded benches on the corner and a small public parking lot on the left too. With the little wine bar across the street, it's even a nice place to have wine and dessert fron Stine Table by the fountain as it cools down. They have beer, but not sure if they have wine."}
{"text":"This was my second visit.  First time for lunch. I arrived shortly after 11a and there were 2 people ordering ahead of me already. I had a feeling it might get crowded at lunchtime and after I sat down at a table awaiting my order, the stream of people coming in was steady. 

I had the lunch special pizza/flatbread w/ chicken. It was delicious, gourmet and just the right size for lunch."}
{"text":"Shrimp and grits were good, but the shrimp were obviously overcooked.  Would've given a half star less but not an option on here.  The environment was great, they had a limited but detailed menu, and everything sounded great.  I had a watermelon cooler that was delicious and the attention to detail and freshness of the food was on point.  I was able to grab a table outside on the sidewalk and enjoy the outside air during my meal."}
{"text":"Stone Table is one of those fantastic restaurants that you read on magazines or watch on TV but are unlikely to ever run into. It's located in the remote and sleepy town of Monroe, NC. In the middle of the classic American main street of times past. I honestly never expected to find anything more than average food while driving thru the area, but, oh, was I wrong. I came in for a late lunch and was short on time but ate the best shrimp and grits that I've ever had. The grits had the perfect consistency. They were covered in a mildly spicy sauce that came together with the cheese on the grits. The shrimps were perfectly cooked, buttery and juicy and all different layers of flavors made this an unforgettable dish. The service was great. Everyone was courteous and had a genuine smile on their face. Now I have a reason to come and visit Monroe. I will definitely be back to try other dishes on the menu. It's great to find a place that builds on such a common staple, as is Southern food around here, and make it exciting and delicious."}
{"text":"Kind of place I would find in my home of Los Angeles. Concerned with local fare and proud of what they offer. Loved it."}
{"text":"For two days I had food from this caterer, and it was excellent! I had the BLT, which was made with big ole slices of mater, thick slices bacon, and some L in there, too. The bread was also thick, buttered slices of Texas Toast. It was a true, delicious grease bomb. Filled me up but didn't slow me down. Apparently came with a bag of fried tortilla bread, which must be da stuff they had leftover from the previous day. I recommend this for lunch, and it would probably be the only thing I ever got even though I'm sure the other food is also amazing. Colleagues ate the gigantic salads with no complaints."}
{"text":"Absolutely divine!! I had to come to Monroe for traffic court and saw the Stone Table on Yelp. I am so glad that I stopped in. I had the turkey wrap with caramelized onions and walnut mayonnaise. I also had the fresh-cut truffle fries. Everything was delicious. The turkey was fresh roasted, the onions were amazing and the fries melted in my mouth. I would come back to Monroe, which is a 3 hour drive just to visit the Stone Table again and try everything else on the menu. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"The food is usually good but the portions are small for the price they charge. There are not a lot of options in Monroe, but most of the time I'd choose to go somewhere else since the prices are so high for what you get."}
{"text":"I had the EVOO Breakfast Sandwich and a Lemon Bar.  Both were very tasty!  My order was ready quickly and the gentleman behind the counter was very welcoming.
I'll be back again next time I'm in North Carolina!"}
{"text":"stone table is a nice lil chill eatery. I enjoyed the food as well. Downtown Monroe need more Lil places  like this. The customer service was excellent. They made me feel at home and at ease. The pineapple water  was litty"}
{"text":"A wonderful little place. Good food with a great atmosphere! Menu has pretty much everything delicious from Power Balls for breakfast to shrimp and grits hot entree! Good assortment of beer wine and non alcoholic drinks. 
The hamburger was delicious with slaw and pimento cheese on top of a wonderful patty fresh bun and sweet potato fries as a side. Great people behind the counter and in the kitchen which is seen from the counter."}
{"text":"I can't believe downtown Monroe has something so good! The service is fast and the people here are friendly! It's definitely my go to place whenever I'm in the area. I've been here a couple of times now and it's never disappointed me. 

Whimsy Plate- This is a dish for people who likes to try new things. Basically the chef chooses what to make/cook. It let's them be as creative as they want and I get this every time! Even if you and a friend were to order whimsy plate you'll both get totally different dishes. 

Butter coffee- At first, I was a bit hesitant since who puts butter in coffee? But like everything here, it was actually really good! It gave a more creamy texture to the coffee. If you like coffee I would give this a try! 

Lemon bars- Just the right amount of tartness and sweetness. I would say the crust was just a tad bit hard."}
{"text":"My friends and I were in the area so we thought we'd try this unique hot spot in the heart of Monroe.  Monroe is really transforming into a cute little town.  We parked in a public parking lot, that was free I might add and walked around the block a couple times before getting to the Stone Table.
Well, it was lunch time on a Saturday and it was full (not packed mine you, but full).  The whole experience wasn't like no other.  You walk in and then order, then find a seat and they bring the food to you.  It's not like your fast food place where you order your food and take a number, but it was just different in a good way.
I had the basic grilled cheese sandwich and ordered the AHHHMAZING fried pickles (per another person's review here on Yelp).  I also ordered a Large (which is really large) french press coffee.  All delicious, I just wish they weren't so stingy with their cream (only a shot glass full).  My teen got the double burger and he said it was the best burger he had in a long time.  Note, the only veggies on the burger were pickles.  My friends got a Kale salad (need I say more??) and a chicken wrap.  They enjoyed the food.
They are were bustling around doing their best to accommodate everyone and they did a pretty good job.  I will probably be back again to try something else.
For a lunch of 4 with tip it came to about $64.00."}
{"text":"I've now frequented Stone Table for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Matt, the head chef, as well as his entire staff are incredibly accommodating and extremely chill. They all go out of their way to ensure your dining experience is one for the books.

Their Shrimp-and-Grits is OUTSTANDING, and even what would seem so mundane as a bacon burger or pork sandwich... exceptionally prepared with notable presentation. Taste and quality are consistent homeruns at Stone Table.

Drink selection is more than enough; choose your poison(s)! Lots of fantastic beers and wines, both nat'l and local brands. Or if water's your thing, simply help yourself to refreshing infused water. Furthermore, their coffee's also a hit! Knock yourself out -- they certainly don't mind.

As for dessert, Stone Table offers very fresh concoctions. Select from super fresh pastries and other baked goods, or see what the crew can whip up for you. Never a disappointment!

Ultimately, Matt's achieved something amazing here. Especially for Monroe, this place simply breaks the mold of blatantly typical Southern fare that's almost too prevalent in the area. His ongoing pursuit to utilize only THE freshest ingredients is readily apparent in each and every dish, with each and every bite. Great job, Stone Table! Great job."}
{"text":"Stumbled on this place and, wow! The butternut squash and sweet potato purée soup was out of this world. Perfect spice combinations and texture, it would be worth the trip to Monroe all on its own. We also ordered the kale salad with peanuts, carrots, field peas, apple, red onions and Parmesan cheese. Dressing made it light and tasty, so this was a perfect combo. For those of you who have given up on good tasting, healthy, affordable lunch-- make the trip to Monroe! The cafe is so cute and sits on an old-Timey feeling street in \"downtown\" Monroe. My mother in law and I sat outside at a cafe table. We were there for lunch but I noticed a fantastic selection of craft beers. The bread pudding,brownies, cookies and lemon bars also looked amazing. They are made my a gramma named Mimi. 

They also do cooking classes and take out dinners, evidently. We will be back !!!"}
{"text":"Delicious. Where else can you get a \"Peanut Butter, Banana and Bacon sandwich with a fresh cup of fruit (kiwi, pomegranate, figs and what not in it) and watermelon infused water? Not too many places. This has some eclectic choice of sandwiches and salads not to mention the homemade desserts which are provided by the mother of the owners. The seating is a bit of a hassle and due to the made to order style it takes a little longer then a \"30min. Luncher\" may have but just call ahead to make that problem go away."}
{"text":"This is a locally owned and operated restaurant of small tables and great dishes . They do wonderful catering in Monroe as well. I'm recommending them well."}
{"text":"Awesome small restaurant in Downtown Monroe. Food is fantastic, service is excellent and they have a great selection of beer. If you go the Shrimp and Grits are a must!!!"}
{"text":"This is a very special restaurant and especially special if you like high quality, delicious, and unique food preparation.  We came on a Thursday night when they featured half priced wine bottles and acoustic guitar.  We were treated by personal conversations with both chefs and gained a better understanding of the restaurant, as a result. 

Be adventurous and try the \"whimsy\" - after selecting carnivore or herbivore, the chefs prepare a one-off dish from a group of ingredients handed to them by the other.  Give a professional license to do what he/she loves and the results are delightful!!

For a great experience, get personal with someone who works here and end your meal with a butter coffee - a wonderful blend of freshly brewed coffee, butter, and a hint of coconut. 

This restaurant also has baked goods, a coffee bar, wine/beer, and can feed you for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. 

We look forward to joining them on a Friday or Saturday night when they feature a multiple course chefs-choice meal."}
{"text":"This is a nice place went for lunch on a week day. You can place your order at the front register and it will be brought out to you. The staff are friendly and welcoming. I got the grilled chicken wrap which was delicious. For dessert I got the pumpkin roll which was yummy. They gave chips as a side with the wrap which were made fresh and were tasty. The chips would of been great if paired with a sauce because they needed something. The food came out in a timely manner. The water had fresh fruit and the tea had different sweeteners out for you to flavor it how you wanted. The place was clean and you got a great view of the downtown area. It's also close to the court house. I recommend and will be back. The prices are affordable too! Hope this helps."}
{"text":"Great food
Just had the shaved beef and pimento sandwich with a salad and the cucumber dressing.  Delicious.  Only reason to give 4 instead of 5 stars is the atmosphere needed to be a little more eclectic with some wall art.  Nothing overdone.  Food is 5 stars.  Great for lunch!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were having a date night around the Monroe area last Friday. We noticed that there was a classic car show around downtown so we decided to walk around. When it was time to eat dinner we looked up on yelp to see what was good around the neighborhood. I trust a lot of the reviews on yelp so we decided to go with Stone Table. I never had terrible service paired up with great food. It was a confusing experience. Let me clarify, we walked in and patiently stood in line. It took about 7 mins for someone to tell us to take a sit. When the waiter came he looked confused and nervous. He told me there were only 3 appetizers and 3 entrees you can order for dinner. We looked at each other and thought really? At that point we decided we just rather stay and order. 

About 15 mins later the table behind us got their food, there were items on that table that were not on the 3 appetizer and 3 entree option only list. So at this point we were already pissed we had to order more expensive entrees when clearly everyone else didn't have to... The table behind us also got their food before us somehow and we came a little earlier then them. Our food arrive 30 mins after ordering and it was a bit cold but surprisingly the food tasted amazing. AMAZING. Applause for the kitchen! Booooo on our waiter. My boyfriend got the Shrimp Scampi with side items of hash brown casserole and collard greens. I got the appetizer of chicken wings. 

Our waiter never once checked on us. My water was never re-filled. We kept looking around at every one else's table and their server was very attentive to other customers. When it was time to leave we had to go up to the counter and ask for our checks. Pretty sure they're suppose to bring the checks to you. Even then our server did not remember what we ordered and did not apologize for any inconvenience. As much as I like to leave 4-5 stars ratings. I couldn't do it this time since we didn't felt like we had the best dinner date experience there..."}
{"text":"A slice of heaven (along with a slice of tomato pie) right in downtown Monroe NC. This is my 2nd visit here this week and can't wait for the next time. They have the most unique menu I've ever seen, and so far, I've been wow'd with everything we're had. Check it out:  Peanut butter, banana & bacon ... Grilled, Pork belly sandwich, marinated BLT, peach sandwich, and the list goes on. They are only open 8 am - 6pm, Monday - Thursday ... open until 9 pm on Friday. Oh my yummy!"}
{"text":"Wow what a gem! Went for lunch, service was fast and fresh. The menu was pretty varied, but not overwhelming with f. I had the veggie sandwich with o-rings. The hot chocolate was like eating a warm bowl of ice cream, really decadent. The place was packed for lunch. Small dining area, but find a place to sit and they bring your meal out, really fun crowd! Would recommend as a stop anytime or if you are a foodie passing thru the area, definitely worth taking a detour to stop."}
{"text":"Absolute surprise and delight. I truly enjoyed my food and experience at stone table. This is a hidden gem."}
{"text":"This place has so much going for it! Love the fresh juice they offer! Tons of goodies and fresh baked goods. I had the brioche bun with egg and bacon. I was turned off by the kraft cheese they put on it and I ended up picking it off. I guess I was expecting some delicious, fresh, real cheese. The chips that were on the side were confusing to me. I think it would be better served with fresh fruit or something a little more in line with breakfast or brunch food. My friend had the cheese grits and said they were awesome. Staff was super friendly and helpful! Love that this is in the heart of Monroe and offering such an awesome menu!"}
{"text":"Fantastic local spot in Downtown Monroe.  Food is prepared fresh daily!  Southern cooking with a twist.  Rotating menu board with a few staples. 

Decent craft beer selection for this type of restaurant!

Think it's cool how you can see the staff openly preparing the meat and dishes in the open layout.  Always a friendly face to greet you at the register."}
{"text":"Went to this place on a whim. I live in Charlotte but work in Monroe. It was fantastic! Their pricing makes it that much more attractive. I had the turkey wrap with cranberry, sweet potato croutons, goat cheese...YUM! Highly recommend this place. Support local eats!"}
{"text":"One of the best southern style restaurants I've ever been too. The staff is very very friendly and the food is absolutely amazing! I had the burger and their cheesecake, which was definitely the best cheesecake I've ever had!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice, both times I got the chicken salad bc I really liked it. The fries with the Parmesan are really good. The homemade chips that come with the sandwiches are really good. My friend got the peach sandwich and she loved it! Another friend got the shrimp and grits and said it was one of the best dishes she'd had."}
{"text":"Wow! I stopped in trying to find authentic Monroe food instead of going to a chain and this place was phenomenal! The food was hot and fresh. Everything was made with fresh ingredients. I had the autumn turkey wrap and cinnamon sweet potatoes fries! Too die for!"}
{"text":"Ugh, this place was overpriced and the food was not good.  The service was pretty good considering that I felt like they were trying to help us but the fact place is small and the lunch crowd was loud which made the environment for eating/talking almost impossible.   We will Not be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I had an all around bad experience here...

I subbed out goat cheese for Parmesan cheese as I'm pregnant and they upcharged me without advising me at the time. The sad part is there was barely any on my salad. Conversely They didn't offer any discount when they had to make substitutions because they were out of main ingredients (they advised me after I ordered). They also charged me for extra sauces that I did not receive. Be sure to check your bill closely as they also left food off of our order. At the end of the meal when we were asked if we enjoyed our lunch we gave an honest response. We were told  \"well lots of people like it, I've never heard that..etc.\", basically the server went on to make us feel super uncomfortable...why ask then? The steak on the salad was served cold and with fat in tact (cold congealed fat is gross on steak for the record). 

I wrote an email to the owner in order to allow him to make it right and while he offered a pseudo apology where he said that they were honest mistakes (perhaps true, but there were several) and he remarked \"sorry you didn't approve of our tastes\" ..he also said \"Not every mistake in a person's day should be gratified by gifting someone else.\" I was really surprised by the lack of accountability. For the record I didn't ask for a free meal, but felt like he was actually upset that I chose to inform him of my experience. With customer service like that I wish them luck but I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Somewhat surprisingly, I do not often write one-star reviews, but in this case, it seems important. We drove out to check the Stone Table, and were first confronted with hours that were an issue.

When taking a look at a new - for us - restaurant, we will look to make sure we know what's up. Several sites (Google, Yelp and even their own site) mention that they are open from \"9am to 9pm\". No problem. Monroe isn't on our normal circuit, but thought it would make a nice stop. So we headed over. It is worth noting two things.

Monday through Wednesday, they are open until 6pm. This was not Monday through Wednesday. Thursday through Saturday, they are open until 9pm, and they invite you to a \"chef-driven menu utilizing local ingredients\", from 6pm to 9pm. Okay, whatever that means. Nowhere does it mention anything about closing early, not being available at a certain time or what happens to their \"normal\" menu.

So, we arrive at about 5pm. This is important, because it's before their standard closing time. When we do, they tell us that they offer their aforementioned chef-driven menu, but it's not for another hour or so, and we're welcome to wait. Uh, no thanks. We're kinda hungry now. 

Oh, sorry, that's not an option. Wait, what? You're supposed to be open from 9am until 9pm. I get that online information isn't always right, but it's even on your own site. Hmm, definitely odd. So I guess it's just not meant to be. We'll pass.

Since there is no information online (and also nothing on or even in the building) mentioning that they close early to offer this chef-driven menu, I have no clue when their operating hours actually are. You might want to check first if planning a trip to see them."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant a few months ago and everything they serve is delicious, especially the organic coffee they make with coconut oil and Irish butter... it was amazing!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in my book. Stopped here one morning in search of coffee and maybe something to eat. Got a French press and a cinnamon roll. The coffee was great, but the cinnamon roll was fantastic! It was hands down the best I have ever had. The roll was extremely warm and fresh. Cinnamon ratio was perfect and icing was divine. No one else in there since it was a little later in the morning, but the girl working the counter was extremely nice. I'll definitely swing through here anytime I'm back in monroe."}
{"text":"I am so impressed by this place. I make special , purposeful trips out here to Monroe to be able to eat here. Great local ingredients made in to amazing dishes,,,,,some simple some are exquisite. Nothing short of AWESOME."}
{"text":"I first heard about this place when attending Taste of Union. My husband and I were looking for somewhere different to go for lunch in Monroe. As soon as I saw Shrimp and Grits on their menu I was sold. The location is easy to get to and has plenty of parking. From the outside it just looks like a ordinary store front restaurant. However, once you walk in, there's nothing ordinary about it. The menu is a upscale mix of eclectic choices and, of course, Shrimp and Grits. We arrived just before noon and once noon hit, there was a line out the door. They did not disappoint with their food, it was fine dining quality!!!! Even the lavender lemonade was to die for. Friendly staff, clean and quick service. Love, love , love!!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely crushed it! What a gem of a place with fantastic service and very warm, friendly staff. I can't wait to come back to Monroe just to eat here! 

This continues to be our favorite spot when we come home to visit family. Love the staff and the food at this place!"}
{"text":"Easily the best product in Monroe! Stone Table also catered my wedding,  now 3 years later we are welcomed by name still every time we go. The shrimp and grits are amazing, the bread for any sandwich is baked in house. I have an uncle in California who refuses to visit me without a visit to Stone Table. I am not doing this place justice with my description  but I promise you....AMAZING!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for lunch. I had the roasted chicken salad sandwich he had the chicken biscuit. Great selections of entrees and prices are resonable. Prepared to order and quickly. We will be going back!"}
{"text":"Chef Matthew is a true talent and has created a menu to reflect the South and it's fantastic culinary history. He takes simple dishes and puts his very own and unique spin on them to make even the most commonplace dishes pop with new life and explosive flavor. If you're in Monroe, treat yourself to this local delight."}
{"text":"The food here is simply awesome! Good, southern food that tastes amazing and the service is genuine and comforting. Came here on a whim and certainly not disappointed! I think we found a great new lunch spot! Get the Shrimp and Grits!"}
{"text":"The food, atmosphere and customer service was awesome. We were tired when we got here and only picked the spot because we stumbled upon it. Too tired to really even look at the menu! So we just ordered cheeseburgers and fries!

Little did we know we'd be getting these awesome burgers. The slaw was a little strong, but still nice. I saw someone else's onion rings as a side (we had them on the burgers), and they looked amazing. 

I'd love to go back when I had more time to really explore the menu.

What a gem!"}
{"text":"I was passing through this town and decided to go because of all the good comments on Yelp. I had The meatloaf sandwich with sweet potato fries. Best meatloaf and best sweet potato fries I have ever had. I'm in a different city every day traveling with my job and this is By far the best I have ever had. Will alway comeback here when I am near."}
{"text":"Excellent!  We moved to the area 6 months ago & I have been looking for a restaurant with fresh unique food in the area (without driving to charlotte). Finally found it! This place is fantastic. The last time I tried to go here for lunch (a Thursday) the place was super busy with no seating, but today (Monday) was much slower.  I got the kale salad with field peas, apples & peanuts. This salad was perfect and dressing was wonderful.  I also got the pimento cheese with chips which was also great.  
I hear the shrimp & grits is amazing so I will definitely be bringing my husband back so he can try that!  So glad I found this place and that it is in Monroe.  I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was beyond amazing!!! This restaurant could makebit in any big, fancy city. So, to find it in humble Monroe was such a treat. I had the special of the day ... a southern twist on a Shepherd's pie."}
{"text":"Last night my wife and I and four of our friends enjoyed a late afternoon cooking class with Matthew and Chris. The whole experience was a little over two hours long and we all enjoyed it quite a bit. Matthew and Chris were great at demonstrating technique, culinary knowledge and their love for food. It is very obvious they both love what they do and have a lot of fun in the kitchen. I could write pages on the food we ate, but i will just say that everything prepared was amazingly delicious and very fresh. We are looking forward to Stone Table's growth and can't wait to come back for some awesome food!

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Don't let the tiny little space deter you. That's how they keep overhead low so they can serve such fresh seasonal food at inexpensive prices. Definitely worth the visit to downtown Monroe. The pimento cheese grilled cheese, asparagus soup and sweet potato fries are some of my favorites."}
{"text":"In town for 2 nights and was searching for a good place to have dinner. 
This place caught our attention and gave them a call to check. Today Friday was a 4 course meal, and what a meal. To die for, delish, different tastes popping your palate. 
We left the place very satisfied with the ambiance, staff and food.
Thanks to Stone Table!"}
{"text":"I go to this place every time I come to court. It is one of favorite things about going to court in Union County. Lovely people, delicious and organic food, and fun environment. Nothing you would necessarily expect in that area. Their specials are always a wonderful surprise (even though I love getting the kale salad with chicken every time). Gotta check this place out."}
{"text":"Food is amazing! Every time I come I try something new and I am always impressed. Great local beer selection. Fresh made teas this is the local spot with local ingredients."}
{"text":"So happy to have a place like this in downtown Monroe! The atmosphere and service were great and the food is creative and terrific! The fried pickles were some of the best we've had. I can't wait to go back and try everything else on the menu!"}
{"text":"Was in the area for a wine tasting and came across this quaint little gem . The  staff was welcoming and seemed eager to answer any questions we may have had . It always makes my day when you can feel the love a restaurant has for its customers . We ordered the Stone Table Burger  & Shrimp and Grits.  The presentation of the food was beautiful and visually appetizing . The hubster commented how delicious the fries were on several occasions . My Shrimp and Grits were quite delicious . The creamy and spicy sauce was a great compliment to the thick ,  Carolina  sourced grits . You get plenty of shrimp and the dish is quite filing . My only issue , personal issue that is , with the shrimp is that they were not deveined . I prefer a deveined shrimp . Nonetheless the dish was fantastic and I'd order again"}
{"text":"The food was good.  I had the chicken wrap and my friend had the grits breakfast.  We also had the fried pickles and the strawberry toast.  

My friend paid for 2 jellies and then was told they only had grape.  Was not offered any refund or alternative. 

The wrap was good. I would order that again. 

The pickles. OH MY GEEE.... they were the most amazing fried pickles I've had ever had.  Thickly cut, sweet and perfectly fried with a side of ranch. 

The strawberry toast was ehh a little bland but it sounded delicious with almond butter, honey and fresh cut strawberries. 

Let's talk about the customer experience here.   I watched as one lady went around every table and skipped ours.  We got our own water but no one at all came to check on us and how we were doing.  We weren't even told \"goodbye or thanks for coming by \" I feel like it wasn't a Caucasian table, so they were  not interested in catering to our needs like they were to the other guests which is sad because they have good food. 

In conclusion, if you are of color- expect good food but poor service."}
{"text":"The food is always amazing!  Seating is very limited and difficult at peak times. The food is always worth it. Great friendly customer service."}
