{"text":"A wonderful little corner bar!  Come for the well priced drinks and fantastic staff, but stay for the sandwiches!!!   No really!  Get a corned beef sandwich or a french dip or any other deli sandwich on the menu and tell me with a straight face that its not the best sandwich you've ever eaten!!  Ever watch Man vs Food, or No Reservations or any travel show where the host finds a tiny little place with food that just makes you drool?  ...This is one of those places...     You've driven by it a thousand times, and you've driven by the best sandwiches you'll ever eat!"}
{"text":"For a bar they have fabulous deli sandwiches that are stacked high! The bartenders are always friendly! Its a great local neighborhood bar. They also have a great meat and cheese plate that will surprise you."}
{"text":"I had no idea this was a deli. I knew it was a dive bar and there's nothing wrong with that. We play darts here. Kind of older crowd, beer and a shot place. Dark, dingy, and lots of smokers on the patio. I've been here on Xmas before, gotta love a bar that's open on Xmas. $10 minimum on credit cards according to hand-written sign."}
{"text":"Ale Haus reminds me of a bar called CJ's in Pleasant Hill, CA in the East Bay. This is a great place to come and drink for cheap. Come to Ale Haus and live a Bukowski-esque dream. Beer is $1.50 at Happy Hour. Ninja Sushi is next door. Take a date to Ninja and venture to Ale Haus. She will be impressed or depressed. I saw a girl on Instagram this morning post a picture of her and her friend sitting on beach chairs in Thailand with the caption \"Life is rough.\" It is and will flip on you. People probably laughed at life on that same beach until a cyclone came. Come to Ale Haus and position yourself in the middle of the storm. I leave you with words from Ice-T:  This is not supposed to be positive This music is negative, because the streets are negative You know; so.. in the records You're gonna hear violence, you're gonna hear aggressive behavior by individuals that lived that lifestyle out You know; that's why I tell them, it's not like Steven King Who makes a horror movie with a happy ending They don't have happy endings, it's a horror movie It's supposed to end horrible, you see! And this is what I do, so.. people that are gonna.. that did like me Are gonna be.. really shocked when they hear my new record Cause it's going to scare the **** out of people"}
