{"text":"Oh gag. Took two bites of the pizza slices and our party walked out. We walked in at 2:30 for the first time. There were many different KOSHER (no meat) pizza already made and cold for many hours. Our party were surprised but we all ordered. They re-heated the slices we ordered. Absolutely no taste very bland. Silverware  was dirty---bad bad sign. We laughed cuz we all hated them. Never again. Dont recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"In Phoenix for a few days from LA.  I had no expectations from LaBella other than not to be hungry. Wow!  What a pleasant surprise.  The food was great.  We were a large group and had two types of pizza, two pastas and salads.  The staff was helpful and friendly.  I enjoyed the food so much that I came back the next day.  So nice to have great kosher food in an \"out-of-town\" city.   If LaBdella was located in LA I would be a regular."}
{"text":"My family was visiting from New York and we ate here 2 times. The food and service were excellent. We felt like we were eating pizza in New York. The regular pizza and the stuffed pizza were superb and the ravioli dish was also excellent. The owner was very friendly and generous with the portions. The prices were also better than what we pay in New York. A must place to eat in Phoenix.

{"text":"Perhaps this place has a lot of family, friends, and employees that are willing to lie on Yelp for them, or maybe there is actually a small group of New Yorkers that only know super crappy pizza, but I absolutely cannot understand the good reviews for this place. Perhaps the local Jewish community is keeping them alive, but we were thoroughly disappointed after giving this place a try for local pizza delivery. The crust is not New York at all! It might be thin but the flavor is worse than most frozen or franchise. The cheese was low quality and the sauce was bland. Yuck! I would have been happier eating a $5 frozen pizza. It was hard to believe too after reading the reviews on here and seeing the pictures. Don't order! The negative reviews on here speak truth. Don't be a victim of false Yelp advertisement; SAVE YOUR MONEY! This place is double than what other places are in the area and you'll be pissed at first bite! I have never been inside but this pizza was so sub-par I wouldn't given anything there another chance. It kinda freaks me out to read they sell sushi there too. Just weird."}
{"text":"WOW - this place is the REAL DEAL. it's kosher/no meat, so you won't be ordering a sausage or pepperoni pizza...so that kinda dampened it for me before ordering. HOWEVER, what these guys do with non-meat pizza is AMAZING. the pizza here is better than:
-Bianco
-Oregano's
-Federal
-etc etc etc.
first time i've had new york-tasting pizza in phoenix. period.
we sampled pretty much all of their slices over the course of a few lunches. the baked ziti pizza is like a Carb Missile but my god it's delicious.
if you're from NY - you'll feel like you're in NY. from the outside this place doesn't look like much. but inside it's a super-cool art deco design and the space/restrooms are well-tended and very clean. if you're from L.A. you'll feel like you're in Hancock Park.
a very unusual, below-the-radar but SO DELICIOUS kind of place. i'll take this over any of the \"Arizona Republic/New Times\" b.s. Top Ten pizzas ANY DAY.
the best pizza in Phoenix has been found, and it's here.
also: i haven't tried the pasta dishes yet, but the owner told me all of the pasta is flown in from NY. (LaBella has an NY location.)"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza by the slice, great atmosphere, great vegetarian options. I love it!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and great service! Ordered the Moroccan pizza and loved every bite. Best pizza I've found in Phoenix"}
{"text":"The service was great!  I was so happy to find a Kosher Restaurant.  Plenty of place to sit and it was very clean.  The food I ordered was perfect and the coffee was great!"}
{"text":"Walking into this place looks nice and well kept. I liked the setup they have. I'm giving this place five star rating not for how nice and casual it is but for the food. I haven't tried everything on the menu yet, but I will that's my plan in the near future. I have had at least five items from the menu so far and I got hooked.  It all tasted to what I expected it to and I'm glad for that because there isn't a lot of kosher restaurants out here, so it's nice to know I can get kosher food in a restaurant and enjoy it. The menu selections are awesome a lot to choose from, so there's something for everybody that loves to eat from pastas to pizzas and so on. By the way this place is dairy only. Give them a try you will enjoy it."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful restaurant with good food and quick, courteous service.  I have had good experience with them, whether I'm eating in, taking the order to go, or ordering a delivery.  Definitely recommend for anyone looking for a vegetarian, kosher pizza.  The fish and soups are quite amazing as well. In fact, I'd start by asking what the soup of the day is and go from there!"}
{"text":"This place is PHENOMENAL. We eat Halal, which is similar to Kosher, so were excited to find out about this place. We called to place an order, and got very pleasant service over the phone. Upon going in, though, the service was somehow even better. They were very personable, very friendly, and upon finding out it was our first time there, decided to give us a bunch of free slices of various flavors to try out. Perhaps this was because it was near closing time, but still, so kind of them! And the slices they gave us tasted sooooooo good! In fact, they were all better than the pie we ordered! Not to say that the one we ordered was bad - in fact, it was quite good! But the variety of flavors they gave us - amazing. We can't wait to go back there. Great food, AND kosher, AND awesome service - where do you get that?? That's hard to find even in NYC, forget Phoenix!!"}
{"text":"Too expensive of a pizza and the workers were not nice. They answer in a rough manner and when I requested that the order was wrong they might it a big deal despite I was right and showed them the receipt."}
{"text":"Food is good and the service is FANTASTIC. Nathan does a great job running the place giving every customer personal attention."}
{"text":"The restaurant is still new with the new feel.  Simple fast food pizza environment  with a kosher twist.  The food tasted excellent,  the portions generous and the prices were for the most part friendly. The menu board is hard to read you'll have to catch it at the right angle to read. The decor is simple industrial with the ubiquitous concrete floor you run into almost every where now. 
Don't hesitate to visit and eat here the experience is positive for a kosher pizza joint."}
{"text":"In a world where Excellence, Quality, and Service are often hollow echoes of promises, it's nice to find a business whose staff and product back up all three.  LaBella is one of those rare companies that offers an excellent product for a fair price and goes above and beyond to ensure customer satisfaction.

I happened to notice LaBella Pizzeria when they were added as an option to my favorite delivery website.  Since then, I've ordered delivery from them a couple of times, and I want to spread the word about this great restaurant! 

Here are just a few ways that LaBella stands out:

- Delivery Presentation - I tend to be a homebody, so I've only ordered delivery from LaBella so far.  Over the years, I've grown to expect poor and/or basic presentation for delivered food.  In stark contrast with my expectations, LaBella goes above and beyond, taking care to ensure that cold items are delivered crisp and cold, hot items are delivered fresh-from-oven hot, and nothing ever looks 'dishevelled' until after I get ahold of it :).  Seriously - their delivered food looks like a neat in-person restaurant presentation, just in a takeout container.
 
 - Delivery time and Order Staging - My average delivery time has been about 40 minutes to an hour, but each of my orders included baked pasta items, so that's a fair timeframe, especially considering drive time.  As far as order staging, it was easy to tell that the salads/cold items were assembled right before sending the order for delivery instead of when the pasta went in the oven - another nice touch of excellence.

 - Fresh, delicious food - Every time I've had their food, it has been immaculately fresh, featuring balanced flavors and high-quality ingredients.  It's wonderful to find a place that doesn't rely on the old standbys of 'make it salty' or 'make it sweet' - the flavors and seasonings are clean, balanced, and complementary.    Some of my personal favorites are their Caprese Salad and their Insalata Bella.  As an added plus, the marinara is also phenomenal *.
 
 - Fantastic customer service - The second time I ordered via the delivery website, one of the items I ordered was sold out.  LaBella contacted me promptly and offered a substitution which I accepted.  Not only was the alternate item delicious, but they unexpectedly threw in a slice of tasty pizza too!  I thought it was a really nice way to go above and beyond for a negligible inconvenience, plus now I know what their pizza tastes like (hint:  it was awesome - good marketing, guys!)
 
I haven't had the opportunity to sample anything from their extensive seafood menu yet, but I think that's where I'm going to head next time.
 
In short, everything I've experienced with them speaks to their attention to detail, commitment to excellence, and dedication to customer satisfaction - thus the 5 stars.  I'm really psyched to have LaBella Pizzeria in the neighborhood (and better yet, offering delivery), and I look forward to seeing them thrive!

*PS:  I speak of the marinara as a former Italian restaurant owner/chef - I think it's awesome."}
{"text":"Food and service was excellent.   I had the Manicotti and it melted in your mouth, just like it should!   Also had a slice of the Sicilian style pizza, the crust was delicious and the Bruschetta which was very fresh and light.   I am neither kosher or a vegetarian, but it doesn't matter, if you want good Italian food go to LaBella!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is great!!!! It is thin and not doughy and moving here from NY I must say it is truly NY style pizza. The atmosphere is warm and inviting and most of all very clean. The staff are great, always smiling and making sure customers are happy. The grilled tuna is cooked to perfection, never dry and tastes superb.  I have been a regular customer since they opened. Keep up the good job!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem. Went to the grand opening today and I must say the pizza is out of this world! Best pizza I have ever had..."}
{"text":"Hate to be mean, really, but what are all these good reviews about?

I've only ordered delivery, so maybe the experience of being actually at the restaurant would be better?

Ordered the pizza with the pesto on it and it was soooo gross. And I love pizza!! And I couldn't eat it. I offered it to my sister who also seriously disliked it and couldn't eat it either. Maybe other items on the menu are good to try though"}
{"text":"Clean establishment, great pizza by the slice, affordable. Will definitely be back to try other options at Labella Pizzeria and Restaurant."}
{"text":"Wow!!!!! This place is amazing! I had the Vegetable soup which made me feel like I was at the kitchen table at my Grandmothers. My husband had the Eggplant Parmesan which he said was great; perfectly cooked and the sauce was excellent- my son got the fish and chips which is made with Tilapia and cooked to perfection. When my husbands salad and my soup came out the owner had also sent out an order of Bruschetta on the house. Oh and we also had a slice of pizza too."}
{"text":"Boating from LA. Great food!

Spinach Salad was great as was Pizza. Mexican dishes were fantastic but the \"hot sauce\" was weak. 

Friendly atmosphere. Nice music and ambience."}
{"text":"I only review places that I would give 5 stars... I wish I could give La Bella Pizzeria 6 stars!!!  The number of options on the menu is amazing. From salads, pasta, pizza and fish to desserts!  Come check out the east coast family style pizzeria... We found it by accident and referrals from other Yelp customers.  We ar very glad we did!"}
{"text":"Lovely little place.  The new owner has taken a really active role and is trying to improve the food.  The garlic knots are amazing and I love the addition of the pastries and gelato.  They have a new food plan for Breakfast, Lunch & Dinner for $99/week.  It's an interesting way to add kosher, healthy meals to your diet with little effort.  I like the changes and it's a favorite!"}
{"text":"La bella is great! My cousins all went to his pizzaria back in queens and in phoenix all my cousins go to him out here.  la Bella catered my sons birthday and was a great hit .   thank you la bella!"}
{"text":"this is a party cool place it kosher and vegetarian now it just need to been gluten free then it would be perfect witch I am non of but for other people it would be grate anyway there menu is very unique for a pizza place they have pizza Italian dishes sushi Mexican food and fried fish grilled fish and whole lot of other thing crazy bug I had two slice of cheese pizza they were just OK they were crispy I like the sauce I think they mix provolone and mozzarella witch I don't care for and the slice wasn't reheated all the way it was warm but the cheese wasn't melted all the way I want to come back and get a fresh pie slices is never what the pizza tasted like fresh try some other dish I saw other people getting  now the people working there none of them seem happy not one smile on anyone faces I guy at the counter unfriendly guy bringing food to the table unfriendly nobody talks to you  give this place extra stars because of its concept and the menu choices it's rely a 3 star place because of the people that work there"}
{"text":"My Bride and I finally made the trip from Tempe to try this kosher pizza shop and we were impressed with the selection of dishes.  My Bride had a fish dish which she really enjoyed.  I came to sample the pizza and I thought for a vegetarian pizza they were pretty fair but bland... lacking distinctive flavor.   My only suggestion is to be creative and use more herbs and seasonings in their sauces - as they are indeed rather bland.  Maybe offer a choice - ie. a selection of mild and savory sauces to appease every palette.  :o)  A meatless pizza, especially needs to be well seasoned.  The bland taste is the only reason we did not give LaBella five stars.  However, the sauces can be improved if they are willing!  The pizza dough was good and they do not skimp on the cheeses.  They were nice folks and did not seem to mind that we were not part of the Orthadox community.  So, we will be back to sample their menu again.  Nice place!  We recommend giving them a try."}
{"text":"My friend and I were seeking a new neighborhood Italan spot on a Friday evening. I had no idea this place is certified Kosher as it wasnt advertised.The food was ok..nothing special compared to other eateries, except Kosher which isnt something I need. 
Lots of fish dishes is a plus but what i had was too spicy for my taste. Also ...what ruined our meal  was two huge family parties that took over the place...talking and walking around in groups like it was a private room. And complete with unwatched screaming children...that sealed the deal...not likely to return. If it was a more pleasant dining area, less like a free for all...and less pricey I'd try another day...small but annoying detail was the huge list of menu items, poorly lit and tiny type, in a high spot over our heads. Ugh."}
{"text":"Came in with a group of friends and they did a great job accommodating all of us. All of their pizzas are really good and I love that they have snapple! Overall really nice place and I'll be back for sure"}
{"text":"I have ordered delivery from La Bella for years with no issues (ok, well one time they were using a new delivery driver and he went to the avenues instead of the streets and gave me some real attitude on the phone, but the restaurant comped my meal so I chalked it up to a frustrated driver who probably knew he was in trouble).

I don't think I've ever had a bad meal from this restaurant. But I went there in person for the first time last night and now my loyalty is shaken. I was SO excited, it had been over a year since I had their awesome pasta. I walked up to the counter and waited for the cashier to stop scrolling through social media for a few seconds before saying hello to get his attention. He was very nice once he took my order and I sat down. I waited a while, that's fine, and then someone who I actually thought was a customer tossed (yes, he tossed it) a plastic bag on the table next to me without a word. He didn't even turn around, I never saw the employee's face! I checked the receipt after about 20 seconds of just sitting there wondering what just happened (was it his food and he was going to sit there?) and it was mine. No acknowledgment from the staff. I have never been more taken aback in a restaurant. Once I got home I opened the container and all my pasta was shifted to one side and leaking, I imagine from being thrown onto the table.

I can't say a bad thing about the food. But since they started using new, more expensive delivery services and the customer service inside is non-existent... I don't know how often I'll be a customer. I don't expect to be treated like royalty when ordering food to go, but come on! It was really unpleasant.

The way I was treated last night was 1 star service. In no way do I feel \"A-OK\" about it as the 3 stars suggest. But I'm not going to give a place with great food 1 star because I had 1 bad experience. Try the pasta, it's great. Don't expect a pleasant dining experience. Probably get it to go...."}
{"text":"There are lots of good reviews here.  I hate to be contrary but ... Our experience was anything but stellar.  My son and I went in to get some slices of pizza.  He had the cheese and I had the vegetable.  My pizza was delivered to the table barely over room temperature.  I could tell it wasn't warm before I looked at it by looking at the cheese. I'm not sure why they couldn't ...

Once we go the pizza warmed up it was on to tasting it.  Good crisp crust.  Sauce, cheese and ingredients - Tasteless.   No zing, no spice.  

We won't be back."}
{"text":"Found this gem by accident, I was driving up 7th and saw pizza by the slice. I tried the white ricotta pizza, the Margarita and they have real homemade Garlic Knots! The marinara was amazing, the owner was so friendly and the place was immaculate, I will definitely be returning to try some other delish, goodies."}
{"text":"Very family friendly kosher restaurant, the pizza is amazing, very fast service, taste delicious, prices are very good!!! Nathan the owner is very nice & family oriented guy that will make this place happenin!!!!"}
{"text":"I meant to update this a month ago but didn't find the time.  Unfortunately now my mother has had a poor experience. She went in in a Sunday for coffee and breakfast bc as clearly stated by the coowner Facebook post on May 23rd  breakfast served Daily from 8am-11am (I attached a picture screen shot) well my mother and her friend stood looking at the breakfast menu when the new chef/owner and another employee behind the counter were having a personal non work related conversation...they stood there about 7min before either of them acknowledged them. When my mother went to order she was told by the chef/new owner that they did not serve breakfast on Sundays. She was shocked as she had just seen this posted online. The owner was rude and my mother brought up the issue of also the website being incorrect with the menu and pricing. The owner got snippy with her saying that is not his website and not for the restuarant...uh, well if you Google or Yelp this place that is in fact the website that comes up. The chef/owner was so rude that my mother clearly stated to him they were leaving and going to Imperial. The new owners disrespect and attitude toward customers is disgraceful. I strongly urge the kosher community to stop coming here. Support the other kinder and more honest businesses and restaurants out there. This place is no longer what it was previously and they clearly do not care."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better kosher restaurants I've eaten in.  The food and service was great!  We ordered a bunch of different appetizers and all were fantastic."}
{"text":"I was brought here by a friend last night. I am not sure I would have picked this restaurant on my own, but I am so glad to have eaten here. Had the Sole Francese, and it was Excellent! Not many restaurants serve fillet of sole, so when I see it I always want to try it. The fish was done perfectly and was in a light lemon sauce. Nathan, the owner, gets his fish from New York where he had a former restaurant. Wherever it comes from, he is doing everything right. It is a very casual place, and definitely family friendly. Everyone else at our table enjoyed their selections, too,-- pizza, ahi tuna, and pasta. The sign outside said, \"Grand Opening.\" Try it before it gets too busy."}
{"text":"GreAt food awesome service . The best fish in town . Must go and check it out . The menu will blow your mind . Way too much to choose . They have something for everyone ."}
{"text":"I had the privilege to come to La Bella's for lunch yesterday... I had a cheese calzone -- fresh and tasty. You can definitely tell everything here is fresh. I love the display window with the pizza, calzone and Stromboli. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"About to undergo a name modification and menu, I've had the distinct privilage to taste some of their new menu offerings... and WoW! Just so Delicious, creative and a beautiful presentation. Please stay open!!!!!:)"}
{"text":"I've seen some reviews from New Yorkers who say this is what they are used to.  The concept is difficult for me to get so I'll defer to their experience.

This place might be a good indicator about what the 7th Street corridor is becoming.  Lots of good places to eat with most of them being unique.  It's hard to think of this little strip center being a destination for food, but with Chen Wok and The Italian Spoon you can make a case that it's at least a great option for lunch.  LaBella is a pretty big step up so it will be interesting to see how it does.

Nice, open design which feels more upscale.  At the register you are hit with fresh slice pizzas, fresh sushi, and fresh baked items.  I went in for a couple of slices but had to backtrack for a bit and take a look at what they had to offer.  It definitely puts you in the mood for eating.

As for the food....  I got a slice of stuffed (cheese) crust cheese and a slice of the pesto.  Both are good, adding a kind of uniqueness to the typical pizza experience.  The bread on the stuffed crust is fresh and they add spices that mix well with the cheese inside.  I enclosed a picture; the pizza is a bit darker because I asked the guy to heat it for a couple of extra minutes.

The thin pesto was good but I'm just not much of a thin crust guy and this was one of the thinnest pizzas I've ever had.  The flavor was unique so I could appreciate that.  I just need a little something more to bite my teeth into.

Two slices and a coke was just under $10.

I get the feeling that this place will have quite a few more hits than misses so check it out if you get the chance.  Review the menu before you go because they have a very large selection catering to a lot of moods.  You can have a simple slice of cheese all the way up to $20 grilled fish."}
{"text":"I was surprised that the restaurant  was kosher when I tried to order  a sausage pizza. The restaurant was busy for early Sunday.  The pizza we ordered  was nice and fresh a little too much cheese. We liked the gnocchi but the sauce was a little too salty. The garlic  bread was crusty with a lot garlic. Service was fast. The interior was simple"}
{"text":"The best end to a busy week is when my coworkers surprise me with PIZZA FRIDAY!!! I love this place. Their pesto pizza is primo and just in case you work with a huge pig like me they give you a complimentary box of pizza rolls! Not sure if that's what they are really called but they are also awesome. Filled with cheesy broccoli or pepperoni, they are best dipped with marinara sauce or ranch. Last but not least- FREE DELIVERY!!! Let's make Pizza Friday a thing from now on, okay?"}
{"text":"The thought that this restaurant serves pizza, Mexican food, and sushi made me hesitant to try it at first. But knowing that it is also kosher and vegetarian intrigued me enough to give it a try. I ordered stromboli, a treat I miss from my NY days. My friend John got the stuffed veggie pizza, and the guys behind the counter gave us some complimentary garlic knots upon knowing that it was our first visit. We sampled each others' orders and they were both good. Definitely New York in style and flavor, and serving sizes were generous. The staff is friendly, the place is clean and has lots of seating, and WiFi is available. I'm definitely coming back to try the other NY treats that I miss and that I found out they serve, such as baked ziti pizza - an item I had a hard time finding in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Every time I've ordered anything here, they've given me something for free. This past Friday it was a slice, Saturday night it was two slices. 

The pizza is decent, it does the job of reminding you that it's kosher pizza, not wood burning cracker thin crust artisanal pizza with house made mozzarella. 

The service is quick, they have football on the big screen and there are plenty of people to watch."}
{"text":"Got this pizza while we were in town recently and we were thrilled!  It is definitely a more New York style of pizza, and the toppings and cheese were delicious.  My wife is gluten free and so she of course tried their gluten free offering; at first, she was a little put off by the fact they they were 2 smaller pizzas and she was concerned that they may be some frozen crusts.  Once she tried them though, she was very happy and she said that you could tell that they were freshly made.  They were not able to deliver to our hotel room but they met us out front and were there well within the time they said they would be there.  The service on the phone was extremely nice and helpful as well.  We would definitely order from them again!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza, friendly and helpful staff, extensive menu.  And kosher to boot.  But I was not particularly enamored of the \"mexican\" food served Tuesday's and Sundays.  Stick with the pizza."}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing customer service. Group of us from LA came in not knowing what to expect and the food was amazing! Mom and Pop establishment so go support them. The owner took amazing care of us and Spanish lady was a blast. Top quality food great prices with exceptional service and food."}
{"text":"Tried the gnocchi with vodka sauce for the second time this week.  It is a little pricey at $15.95 for just a bowl of pasta but it is a large bowl that can easily be shared.  I enjoyed it more the first time but it was still good.

Counter service where they bring the food to you.  Didn't realize we were supposed to grab our own silverware.

The thick pizza filed with pasta also looked really good."}
{"text":"Overpriced mediocre food.  New owner in the last three months, so I don't know how it was before, but my first time there I am not at all impressed.     I ordered a slice of pizza, eggplant parmesan, and a  spinach salad, and I would rate them all mediocre at best.   The eggplant parmesan for $14.00, was just a slab of eggplant parmesan with a too tiny amount of spaghetti and sauce, and nothing with it, no salad, no bread, nothing.   Prices were quite a bit higher than their menu prices listed online. Online menu lists the spinach salad at 7.99, which I think would probably be a bit overpriced at that, so the mediocre spinach salad at $10.00 was very disappointing. $30.00 for a slab of eggplant parmesan, a  spinach side salad and a slice of pizza I think is ridiculous.   I could have a fabulous gourmet meal elsewhere for that price.   I agree with the reviewer who called it price gouging, and gourmet pricing of low end food. They do not provide great food or good value, and there is so much competition on 7th St. that they really should provide at least one of the two if they want to stay in business. Even next door is much more reasonable prices for similar quality.     I will definitely  not be back.  Leave this one alone is my advice."}
{"text":"I am visiting from NY.  Loved the food and service.  We need a place like this on Long Island!"}
{"text":"Went back for the Pizzeria display case items.  I tried the Eggplant and the Phony Pepperoni and the Zeppoli (6).   I was not impressed with any of them.    The Phony alone needs to be avoided.  The Zeppoli which are prepared in advance have an off taste.   Perhaps if they were prepared to order they would have a more enjoyable product as the dough seemed to have been fluffy at one time.   I hope this local business survives with their favorable Reviewers."}
{"text":"As the kosher places go in town, this should be the model. Bright, clean modern and most of all pretty good with a wide selection. 

The menu includes pizza, Italian food, fish dishes, sushi and even fries. You may wonder what do fish, sushi and pizza all have in common. And the biblical answer is they all lack \"meat\"

I tried a pizza roll, a slice covered in pasta and a slice with a giant crust and some fries. 

Part of the fun is the new york style ludicrous pizza with odd toppings. The overall taste is decent and prices are great, especially for the kosher thing.

If you are looking for good kosher dairy fair or some unique pizzas check this place out, just don't expect to find any meat."}
{"text":"I have eaten here probably once each week for the past few months. And I live about 25 miles away. How many Italian places do I pass on my way to and from La Bella? I don't know. A lot.
My favorite dish here is the flounder florentine with grilled veggies and broccoli on the side (what can I say, I like color!)- it's delicious every time. The rolls are wonderful and freeze well. I love the fried eggplant pizza- it kind of balances my super-veggie fish dish. Hubsky loves the sushi. I just can't walk in there and smell that amazing smell and then order sushi! I did venture out and have the veggie enchiladas twice. So delicious.
Nathan and his staff are always friendly, no matter how busy it is. He has arranged delivery of larger orders out to Chandler on multiple occasions.
I'll be back. Probably today.
PS I also think it's funny that people would complain about phony pepperoni. This is a kosher/pesco-vegetarian place!"}
{"text":"I love food.  I love good food, that is.  I have been cooking Italian food for years, and since I started keeping kosher, I have not had a source for good Italian food outside my kitchen.   Then I tried LaBella.  While waiting for the to-go order to be prepared, I enjoyed a cup of their french onion soup.  Such a beautiful, incredible dark flavor.  I could not believe that there was no beef in it.  It was amazing.  I was sad that the crouton with cheese was so small, but at the same time, I was happy that it did not overwhelm the rest of the soup flavor.  There were a lot of onions in the stock like it was made fresh there. 

We had the Penne Alla Vodka and the Eggplant Parm to go.  The penne was delicious, with a smooth and velvety sauce that hit all of the right notes.  The eggplant parm was, according to my wife, second only to mine.

The service there was superb, the folk were friendly and happy to help.  Next time I head through Phoenix, I will stop there."}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican Kosher Food. Good prices! I can recommend also the Pizze as well as the gsrlic bread (delicious!)"}
{"text":"The ingredient quality is fantastic and the customer service was great! So great that we ordered delivery 2 days in a row."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic for Kosher pizza, it's your best bet, on par with any pizza place. They really take care of you here, great service and many options for pizza; including stuff crust."}
{"text":"When my friend suggested we meet for lunch at LaBella, I immediately looked it up on Yelp and read some of their stellar reviews.  I also checked out their menu online and was blown away by all of the options.  Sure, this place is Kosher / Vegetarian, but there is definitely something for everyone here.

I love that it's a fast-casual concept.  Order your food at the counter and they will bring it to you when it's ready... friendly service as well.

I went for the spinach salad and added salmon.  I couldn't resist picking out a slice of the eggplant pizza as well.  (I love that you can choose from tons of different pizza slices and calzones from the case right by where you place your order!)  Everything I had was fresh and delicious.  Needless to say, it filled me up for the rest of the afternoon.

If you are kosher or vegetarian or meeting someone for lunch or dinner that is either one, LaBella is a fabulous option.  They also offer take-out, delivery, and catering."}
{"text":"Crap! I got duped by Yelp! Lol

Didn't realize this place was Kosher AND Vegetarian!
Subsequently, the lasagna was basically a huge gooey wad of cheese stuffed between some decent pasta and sauce. Garden salad was big and fresh. Moz sticks were good if you can get past the rather funky gray exterior breading.

I just can't subscribe to a vegetarian and kosher experience when eating Italian. The two simply are not compatible. They do a nice job here but I will continue to search Phoenix for a \"true\" Italian establishment! Bring on the seasoned pork and meat please!! Lol"}
{"text":"Always looking for a place with pizza by the slice, got two slices and they were awesome! I was surprised how much I liked the slice with zucchini and squash. Good prices, nice staff, will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The pizza is amazing and since I am from Brooklyn, I feel like I speak from a place of knowledge. I especially love the penne pizza, because what's better than pasta on pizza? The Greek salad is also quite good and the owner is so nice and helpful. And the fact that's it's Kosher, is a huge plus."}
{"text":"Can't and won't go anywhere else for pizza! Cheese stuffed crust is simply Devine! Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"I've never heard of a pizza place that doesn't have real pepperoni.  The crust taste good but the sauce was very salty.  The French onion soup taste like it came from a can.  The Fettuccine Alfredo was so bland it was like they just added cream and no other flavors.  The chocolate shake was about the only thing that was good.  I'm really confused as to how this place gets so many good reviews."}
{"text":"We ordered 5 pizzas to my friends house and we just loved it! The cheese tastes great and it was great pizzas !
The friend's said that they definitely will order pizza and go to this place."}
{"text":"So I walk in to LaBella today, door open people still walking in but then get all the way up to the fucking register for them to tell me oh were closed so u couldn't tell me that shit at the door. Open sign still on. Next put a fucking closed sign up dumb asses."}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant.  They have 22 different fish dishes ranging from $16-23, at least a dozen different kinds of pizza slices ready for you to pick out of the case, soups, salads, and 15 kinds of pasta that they will serve with any of 4-6 different sauces.  The food is so yummy!  I rate it 5 stars because the menu is huge, it fits a niche market that is in need of more restaurants, the people are warm and friendly, food is all freshly prepared but the wait is not long, and it is reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I'm from New York, and I travel out west quite often. Must admit for some reason everyone claims that they know how to make New York pizza in the west coast, where in fact they don't! 

The guy who owns this place apparently does. I felt like I'm in New York, while Being in Arizona. 

They also make sushi. 
Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I ate here for lunch yesterday.  They food was a bit pricey, but good."}
{"text":"La Bella never disappoints!  It's my go to comfort food. I have peace of mind when eating here, and always assured of great service and great food!"}
{"text":"Ate here for a new place to go.  Probably the best pizza I have ever had. Great service from the help and very friendly. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I had no idea this gem was only two blocks from my church. The pizza is amazing. The cheese, the sauce and the bread are all delicious. It has a New York feel to it as well - all the pizzas are on display; you pick a slice and they heat it up for you. The service is great as well - super friendly staff. I'm sold on this place and honored to be a regular."}
{"text":"Went in randomly for a slice late at night and it was AMAZING. We even got a complimentary slice! Don't expect any meat lovers here though, all the selections are vegetarian. Still, I will be coming back for sure for the great pizza and awesome service."}
{"text":"Love this place amazing food and amazing service, if your Jews or isreals that's the place for you"}
{"text":"Love this new spot!!! They definitely have the NY feel, food is amazing, great variety of food, family owned business, I'll take this over any franchise pizzeria!!! Prices are very competitive and service is amazing , so glad we have a new pizza spot , they is so much more than a pizzeria!"}
{"text":"This place is great and super friendly. Many different slices to choose from and a huge menu to from also. We WILL be coming back. The kids love be the pasta pizza!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza! We had the vegetable and plain pizza and it was great. Ambience was very comfortable too. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Simply great reasonably priced food. Love the little neighborhood feel and their delivery is on point"}
{"text":"Prices are too high for what you get and then they try to charge you more than what their online menu prices say. New owner is trying to price gouge the kosher community just like previous reviewer said. You can just go down the road to Manhattan Pizza or up the street to Imperial Cafe for your moneys worth."}
{"text":"There is no doubt in my mind that there are fake reviews on here. No one in their right mind would drive 25 miles for this food. It was terrible. We live one street light away and the food came cold, not even warm.. We ordered the Manicotti, the Rigatoni Boscaiola, and a Caesar salad. 
The Caesar came in a large round tin with enough dressing to cover about 6 pieces of lettuce. It was so dry it was inedible - about 2 tspns of dressing. It had tons of shredded carrot, no cheese, no pepper, and  had tons of cucumbers in it. gross
The manicotti was small, bland, and cold.
The Rigatoni was dry, not even enough sauce to cover the pasta.
We got one butt end of a week old dried out piece of french bread, that en total, fit inside my husbands fist. I'm not sure which of us was the lucky one to get this lovely bread with our entree, but the other entree came with nothing. There was also nothing on the bread, and no butter. Since there was no sauce to soak it in, I guess it was to be eaten dry. Our dog didn't even want it. These 3 items were over $33. Not worth it."}
{"text":"I agree with the other reviewers.  Haven't seen a menu like this since I lived in New York.  Had the eggplant parmesan, their cream of cauliflower soup, and incredible grilled vegetables.  I would go back there in a heartbeat!  And, yes, the fish part of the menu is incredibly extensive ...next time we'll try the fish!  Go eat in good health!"}
{"text":"Great friendly service,they even gave my son some complimentary doughnut bites.good place for kosher meals and flavorful pizza"}
{"text":"What a great place. Amazing pizza with so many cool options! We recently moved to Phoenix and we have been so excited to find and try new restaurants! I definitely recommend LaBella if you're looking for a neat place with a warm feel and great friendly service. The sauce is also soooo delicious! I can't wait to go back for pasta! Five Stars for sure!"}
{"text":"Mother in law had it ordered after we spent he day moving her into her new place downtown. Pizza was great. She had no idea that she was ordering kosher pizza but we were all happy. They included a free couple of slices to sample as well. 

Only issue was the condition of pizza when it arrived. Looked like they pizza went through hell before arriving to us. All 3 pizzas looked like the photo I attached."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant! I love the pizza, sushi, fries, and garlic knots. If you're going for healthy, they have lots of fish options with various veggie sides which are great too - I've tried the grilled salmon with lemon sauce and the broiled tilapia. They are always giving extras on the house, especially if you make a large order, which I love. The guys who work there are all so nice. We come here all the time!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ate here the other day and we both loved what we had. We each had different pizza slices and they were great! He is from New York and he can't find good pizza in Arizona. We were given an order of garlic knots on the house and they were Amazing!!! I can't wait to try their pasta. They even have sushi already made in a case to carry out. It is a very nice and clean restaurant. They open on Saturdays after sunset till midnight."}
{"text":"Superb!
The closest thing to NYC Italian cooking for 2,500 miles.  I picked up pizza and a salad for an airport run.  What a find, and in my own neighborhood.  Thanks so much gym-buddy Daryl for the referral."}
{"text":"If you're looking for kosher or vegetarian, this place might be a good option.  Otherwise the food is really
bland. Sauce for pizza and pasta needed spices.  The decor is minimal which fits the run down strip mall location.  The fact that they also serve sushi and Mexican food is just plain weird. Staff was friendly but overall this place was a big disappointment."}
{"text":"This is some of the best pizza I've had in a very long time.  Good pizza in Arizona is hard to come by.  I got the lunch special and then I decided to get a slice of grandmas thick crust pizza.  So good!"}
{"text":"I just ordered this got pizza Garlic bread and mozerella sticks and cheese fries well I'm from NYC and this ant no New York pizza everything was ice cold the mozerella sticks the cheese was ice cold inside didn't even stretch the cheese garlic bread was full of parsley nothing Elsa bread felt stale cheese fries was cold cheese horrible ! Never will
Order again never ever can eat better at dominos !"}
{"text":"Very good pizza with excellent variety, but questionable service. I ordered 5 pies to travel with while we ate in. After 45 minutes, we asked if pizzas were ready, and they said my order had not yet been processed. Fine - mistakes happen. But then the guy tells me, \"it's a big order and we'll get to it when we can.\"

Sheez."}
{"text":"Labella Pizzeria is a very good business..... They have good service and their food is always freshly made. The owner and workers keep that balance of professional and friendly. During the normal school week during lunch hours you will likely see student from a nearby girls school. This is the best kosher pizza restaurant in phoenix."}
{"text":"Fresh,  Fridley,  and fast delivery!  Thank you for providing this town with delicious  food.  My favorite is the salmon bow tie pasta with marinara sauce and veggies! The salmon is so tender and perfect. The soups are delicious and you can't go wrong with them. Try the pastries they have, always fresh! Everything is reasonably priced too. Thank you La Bella!"}
{"text":"I used La Bella to cater an event at work. Nathan, the owner, was super easy to work with and very responsive. The food arrived on time and stayed warm well after the foil was removed. I ordered the half sizes and had plenty of food. The guests enjoyed the food, too. No one would have guessed it came from a kosher restaurant. I would definitely use La Bella again."}
