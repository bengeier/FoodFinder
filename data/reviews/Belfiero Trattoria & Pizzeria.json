{"text":"Went here for takeout and ordered a pizza and a calzone, somehow they screwed up the toppings for both.  Aside from being annoyed there wasn't much flavour, no shock the place is already closed."}
{"text":"If you're looking for hand-tossed, rustic style pizza baked in a 500 degree oven, look no further than this place in eastern Scarborough.  Pizzas (all 12\") range from $9 - $12, and will satisfy if you want a change from the Pizza Pizza/Pizza Hut/Pizzaville style.   On the other hand, pastas were disappointing.  Overpriced for what you get -- quantity wasn't much, so for what they charge (up to $18) the quality had better impress, and it did not.   Tiramisu dessert was a ripoff, was made to order, but for $7, the amount should not fit in an Irish Coffee mug, it should be enough to share."}
{"text":"Where was my lunch Special menu?! Why I was not offered that at 1:30 pm on a Friday?  Belfiero Trattoria & Pizzeria is a good option if you are in Scarborough and looking for some decent Italian food.  I love the Fettuccine Asparagi ($16) which is house made pasta tossed with chopped Asparagus, Prosciutto, Onion, Parmigiano, Cream and Truffle Aroma.   Portion size is a little small... I can eat 2 of those with no problem... The sauce was really good which I wiped the plate clean with some nice warm bread.  Why was I not offered any bread until I ask at the end of my meal? Most Italian restaurants I been to give me some bread even when I order or while I wait for my entrees...  I am willing to come back again to Belfiero to try out their Linguine Frutti di Mare ($19)... (My DC will order that for sure!) but hopefully the services will improve...."}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday Night around 8:30pm for dinner. I was surprised to see how vacant the restaurant was. Perhaps only 4 other couples dining as well.  The restaurant itself is quite modern looking and has a loungey sort of feel. There is a bar at the front of the restaurant with views into the open kitchen beside it. We were promptly greeted upon entering and seated at a cozy booth with grey leather banquets and dark marble top tables. Dim lighting with Italian music in the background plus candle light made for good ambiance. There is a patio at the back of the restaurant for those wishing to dine al fresco.   Our waiter kindly went over all the specials for day and took our drink orders. Shortly after two glasses of perfectly chilled fruity Prosecco arrives After taking our orders the waiter returns with some delicious charred ciabatta bread and a mixture of olive oil and balsamic. The bread was really fresh tasting and we devoured it no time.  Appetizer Baby Spinach Salad - Pine nuts, seasonal fresh berries, topped with Gorgonzola in a light vinaigrette  The salad was huge, loved the balsamic dressing and the pop of sweetness from the fresh blueberries and the creamy Gorgonzola cheese.  Pasta Spaghetti and Meatballs - Homemade spaghetti and meatballs in tomato sauce The pasta was cooked perfectly however I found the dish a little lackluster and maybe a little bland. The meatballs were a good size but they seemed to be a bit on the dry side.   Pizza Margarita Pizza - Hand tossed freshly baked 12 inch pizza with tomato & mozzarella cheese Loved this Pizza! The crust is superrr thin and crispy with nice charring just the way I like it! Perfect balance of tomato sauce and gooey cheese. Definitely a standout!  Overall really great and attentive service. Our waiter kindly checked in on us from time to time to confirm everything was to our liking. Portions were a good size but there pizza is definitely a must try, it will not disappoint!"}
