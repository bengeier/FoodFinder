{"text":"I don't normally bother writing food reviews, but just a few days ago I decided to introduce this place to my parents since they were willing to try something new for once. I've only been here a few times, and not only has their enchiladas and chimichangas left a permanent imprint in my mind and belly, but every time has been a great experience. 

I had the chance of meeting the owner (or manager?) who was super friendly, funny, and a delight to talk with. Overall - friendly staff, great service, catchy background music (I have thrown dance parties in my head), and of course AMAZING, AMAZING food!! Highly recommend going if you haven't yet."}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican restaurants I have been to.

The food is fantastic, terrific flavours and great portions.  Large variety to choose from.
Took my daughter there for a belated 16th bday.  We had beef and steak Chimichangas for our main and the portions were huge. Came with perfectly cooked rice, diced tomato salsa and  a fresh bean dip with fresh home made tortilla chips.  For desert my daughter had Churros with chocolate sauce and a coconut whipped cream, best she said she has ever had ( I was too full but kids have a bottomless pit when it comes to eating)

Will come back with the rest of my family when time permits.  Highly recommended. Great Service"}
{"text":"Bad service, rude employees and worst of all mega sick after eating bland tacos. Not.coming.here.again."}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about. I think this place survives more on tourist versus repeat customers. It's a place we would definitely not go back to. With so many great restaurants there's no reason to go back. The food was dry. When we notified the waitress that the food was dry she basically said yeah sometimes that happens with nothing further to say or apologies for the poor quality of the meals. Not much further to say about this place but there are many other places to try."}
{"text":"We came here on Wed night, catch up with a friend, so gotta look up YELP - I am addicted lol.

Food:  2/5

We ordered platter for 2 - tried all their selection - shrimp, fish, chicken, steak
- fish was good
Burrito  - not too good, small, blend
Nachos - too much chip, too little ingredients (cheese, green onion and tomato)

Service:  2/5

Felt rushed to order - didn't offer recommendation 

Atmosphere:  2/5 

Felt like fast food, table weren't that clean, the music was pretty loud, but it was nice.

Overall score:  40%"}
{"text":"Been here twice.  Once for lunch and the 2nd for dinner.

The food is tasty and seems fresh, but as one of the other reviewers mentioned, I, too, will probably order take- out from now on.

My reasons for the unpleasant dine in experience:
1) The music is blaring loud. My friends and I were yelling at each other to overcome the loud music.  We did inform the waitress to turn the music down, which went down like 1/2 a notch and only to go back up again.

2) it was so hot inside!  Not sure if they have no air con or what??  We were sweating!!

Overall, food is good ..just not going to eat in next time if above continues."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time for a friends bday. Staff is VERY friendly. 

Food was very good. I did find the tortilla chips a bit on the greasy side. Entr√©es are very filling portions and neatly served. 

I'd definitely eat here again"}
{"text":"Presentation of food is nice, however the food was close to cold.
I also found the food to be very bland and lacking spices.
The location is also a bit small.. nice if you are going with 1 or 2 people, but not a larger party.
Also, when I went it was on a weekend. 
They had one server working and approx 7 tables occupied."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in the area. Fresh ingredients, tasty, and well prepared. And at a great price. I've been here for date night with the wife, and a family outing. 

They usually have a great deal of 9 tacos for $20. The fish tacos are great. Good homemade freoles.  And if you have room the churros are awesome!  Probably the best churros I've ever had. 

I highly recommend this place. But get there early on a Saturday, it can fill up fast."}
{"text":"Went to this place on a Friday night. It was busy but we managed to score a table for 2 quickly. Kind of felt like someone's house with a lot of tables. Close quarters, but very casual and cozy. So cozy that you sometimes found the waitresses having to squish by.

We had the platter for 2 which consisted of 4 tacos and a burrito. We also opted for some tortilla chips and guacamole.

The chips and guac were a nice starter. Quite a few chips for 2 though. The guac was spot on and the tortillas were made in house. Nice and crunchy.

The tacos were 2 chicken, 2 pastor. The chicken was quite juicy, however not my fave flavouring. Perhaps it was all the onion? The pastor was really the star of the show. Nice juicy, flaky pieces if pork with full flavour. Some hot sauce as well didn't hurt.

Lastly there was the steak burrito. Decent, however I would've liked a bit more steak.

All in all a pleasant surprise. I'd come back to try more of the menu. I feel like there's still a hidden gem in there! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"In the entire GTA, I have yet to find a better authentic Mexican resto. It is simply unmatched in terms of quality, service, and just overall feel.

I have had several dishes off their menu, and as I cannot speak to their guacamole, as I strongly dislike avocado, I can say that all the ingredients are fresh and used in proper proportions. My favorite dish being the chimichanga is my go-to. It has all the amazingness of a burrito but swaddled in a deep fried tortilla. This masterpiece is then served with a side of rice, and beans with a few tortilla chips.

Servings are very generous, and the staff are polite, courteous, and they even have a mariachi singer!!! 

Overall 11/10"}
{"text":"Planeta Mexico's food was amazing. It was extremely flavourful and delicious. The atmosphere was lovely and cozy. The people are very friendly."}
{"text":"Came to the restaurant with my husband for lunch. The interior is very simple and in my opinion needs renovation. We ordered tacos which come with rice, bean spread and tomato salad. None of the side dished were tasty. Tacos were actually pretty good. For desert we got churos. I looked forward to have some cause I tried them in Spain and Cuba. I was really disappointed. They make them very very thick. So they're too fried on the outside and not cooked enough inside. 
But I have to say they have great service. I think that's what left a good overall impression. They brought one plate of tacos with sour cream and I said that I don't eat dairy and it didn't say anything on the many and without any problem the waitress apologized and remade the dish."}
{"text":"Absolutely awful service... Read the reviews of how bad it was but decided to anyways. It was a very long dinner. Food was definitely not worth the wait either - quite bland, was hoping for better Mexican food in Markham!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times, and always enjoy my meal, but I have to echo the comments of the other reviewers; the service needs improvement. Just recently we went on a Sunday evening at around 5:30. 

We were fortunate in that our order went in just before a large takeout order was placed, as we watched other tables that came in after us wait for about 45 minutes to receive their food (and some even longer). 

We actually managed to place our order, eat, and finish before a table (which came in just shortly after us) had even received their meal. The trouble is I can't seem to figure out where the fault lies. The servers seem to have trouble even retrieving drinks for tables, while the kitchen staff seems to have trouble with large orders. 

I realize this is a fairly new restaurant, and maybe they are still trying to find their groove, but I hope for their sake that they find some synergy soon.

Also, if you're reading any of these reviews before going, I should let you know this is a fairly small restaurant, and bringing small children is probably not the best idea. We sat behind a table with small children who seemed to want to explore and roam around the restaurant. When servers are buzzing around as busy as they were last night, this is a recipe for disaster."}
{"text":"We strolled by on a week day, and decided to give it a try, despite mixed reviews. 

The restaurant is quite quaint, with odd decorations here and there, with TVs, and a 10 person patio. The service was pretty slow, and they did get some of our order wrong. (We asked for a coke, we got a corona. We asked for steak, and they gave us beef). Go to this restaurant if you're not in a rush, and have some time to sit and chat. What makes up for ALL of that is the chef. He is the sole person that puts everything together before and after it hits the kitchen. You can tell he REALLY cares, and his dedication to everything being assembled correctly is quite respectable. 

FOOD:
Quesadilla (chicken) |$10.50| - The first few bites were delicious, but then it started getting to be too much, as there WAY too much cheese in it. As the cheese cools, the more rubbery the cooled cheese is. I stopped after one piece. 
Chimichanga (beef) |$13.5|- Fried quite lightly, which was nice. It was good, but again, the same cheese problem. The beef is better than the chicken.
Tortilla chips: we got some with our meal, and it was really good. It is freshly fried, as we watched the chef cut pita wraps, and deliver them to the kitchen for frying. 

Spicy level warning: mild was not spicy at all. With each bite, I dipped my food in the delicious hot sauce that is available on the table. 

To try next time: 
Sangria: Although I did not try it, it looks really good, with lots of fruit inside. 
Nachos: HUGE. Definitely shareable with 4 people if you are also getting a meal. 
Guacamole: a lot of people ordered it, and like I said, the chips are delicious. 

They also have taco burrito platters for 2 person (4 tacos + one burrito | $23) or 4 person (8 tacos + 2 burritos | $40). I may or may not have just ordered wrong, so I would definitely go back for another try. If you haven't been, it is definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"Worst meal ever. Fruit flies flying around our table throughout the entire meal. Ordered the enchilada which tasted like it was reheated in the microwave (was stake and crispy on the edges) and was drizzled with cheese whiz...the chicken inside it was also super dry. Also ordered the crunchy tacos with beef which was over cooked and dry. Asked the waitress if the meat is suppose to be this dry and she said it's probably from being under the heat lamps. They didn't offer to do anything when we complained about our meal although the waitress was friendly."}
{"text":"Small little place hidden in Main Street, food took long to arrive and my original ordered food was out and wasn't notified until 10 minutes after. Settle for less and was disappointed.
The place had its heater on full blast and was sweating during my whole meal. To say the least, the entertainment was good, as they had a feature artist."}
{"text":"The food was good. I loved the burrotios there. Tacos were average. The ambience of the place was decent but the neighborhood is amazing. 
Worth the money spent. Good food! Should try."}
{"text":"Great food. Mediocre service. The waitress forgot our drink order and we waited about 15 minutes before having to remind her about it. The food was fantastic and generous in terms of serving size. Don't understand the complaints from others about the portions. Everyone we saw either couldn't finish their meals or were taking the rest home. We went on a Saturday night. It was very very busy. Will definitly return"}
{"text":"Bland. 

Went here last week and ordered the platter for 2 which included 4 tacos, a burrito, side of rice and refried beans. We also ordered chips and guacamole to start. When the chips came, they looked like they were dipped in grease. Way too oily for my liking. The guac was bland, there were huge chunks that were still pretty hard - the avocados were not ripe. I ended up having to dice up the guac myself with a knife. We also added salt and hot sauce because there was no taste.

Onto the platter - the burrito, rice and beans.... bland. Had to pile on the hot sauce to make it somewhat tasty. The fish tacos were decent and probably the only thing I'd recommend from this place. 

I would have much rather gone to Chipotle."}
{"text":"There was a special on tues $20 for 9 tacos (3 beef, 3 chicken and 3 of your choice). we chose fish and that was decent but nothing special. The other 6 were super dry and bland (Taco Bell would have been better). It was literally the driest ground beef/ shredded chicken, iceberg lettuce and bean paste. Service was also super slow. Place was also really dirty. There was food all over the floors and we sat next to a window ledge with a dead fly on it."}
{"text":"It's my second time here and again desepcione me. The food is not authentic to Mexico and even no tastes good. The prices are too high for the quality of the ingredients they use. Really a bad experience and would not recommend it. I think the owner should not be Mexican because this restaurant not have an mexican touch."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place out since I first saw it over a year ago.  I'm a huge fan and a loyal patron to another authentic Mexican restaurant (see my review on Cielito Lindo) but of course I'll be as neutral as possible.  

The staff here are very warm and friendly.  As soon as you walk in, you already feel at home. We went here on mid-afternoon on a Tuesday so it wasn't busy.  

Presentation of the food were very lovely so you can tell that because of the neighbourhood, they tried to really boujie up the look of Mexican food.  Nothing wrong with that since you're paying for the actual taste of the food.  Just saying, is all.  You can of course see that with my photos.

[Starters] 
Frijoles Refritos con Queso - I met a friend here who had actually come in earlier and ordered this starter while she waited for me.  So needless to say, it was already at room temperature so don't take this particular part of the review too seriously.  From what I could tell, the tortilla chips were homemade.  How? Well they were very greasy and broke apart so easily as I tried to dip into what was left over.  As mentioned, this app had already gotten cold so I'm sure that scooping it up would have been better.  With the amount of grease though, it made me wonder how greasy it was from the beginning.  My fingers were literally dripping with oil when I held each chip.  3/5

[Mains]
Taco a la Parrilla - You can get the three soft tacos stuff with beef, chicken, pork, vegetables, fish or shrimp.  I opted for the fish which was Basa.  The shell itself was a little on the dry side and lacked flavour.  The fish was cooked perfectly but also lacked a big of flavour.  Even when adding some of the sides (rice, refried beans and pico de gallo), it still lacked some flavour.  What was odd was that one of the tacos had some type of dressing or what seemed like a chipotle mayo.  Not sure exactly what it was but it definitely gave it a nice flavour.  I wish they all had that.  The fish taco I would actually go back for.  Serving was I guess pretty reasonable considering the price ($12) but I do hope they would improve the flavour with the sides.  Also tried the beef but the strips of beef were cooked too much for my liking.  I don't think they asked how my friend wanted her beef cooked but if she chose well done then she's nuts.  The strips ended up dry and again flavourless.  I had to drench it with hot sauce to give it a kick. Beef 3/5, fish 5/5. 

[Dessert]
Churros with Vanilla Ice Cream - I was incredibly excited that they had churros as my favourite Mexican joint doesn't have churros but I left a bit disappointed.  The price was actually great as you get 4 pcs with ice cream (it was $5).  But again with the lack of flavour.  The churros themselves were overcooked or overfried so they were way too crunchy and dry.  I personally prefer mine to have enough crunch on the outside yet nice and chewy on the inside with enough moisture.  As well, I prefer mine to be nicely dusted with cinnamon and brown sugar.  This one had very little, if at all, seasoning.  Even the chocolate syrup wasn't enough.  Perhaps if they had some chocolate syrup on the side or more specifically chocolate syrup made with Mexican chocolate, it would have tasted a little better.  If it weren't for the low price, I would've been even more disappointed. 3/5"}
{"text":"While I didn't go into the restaurant for the food. I dropped by the exterior stall for ice cream and churros. They had a large variety of interesting flavours to choose from. I ended up with Dutch Chocolate and it blended well with the mega hot churros that are freshly fried. The lady who worked there was a bit overwhelmed but she played it off with charm and a great attitude."}
{"text":"Holy Collosus the portions here are huge!! The place may seem grungy and even slightly dirty (i.e. Crumbs on tablecloths) but the food is close enough to the authentic Mexican food I had in the states! 

Most burritos I've had in Toronto are from fast food joints like Fat Bastard or Burrito Boys, but this place has a decent dine in menu! We were seated immediately for lunch around 1PM by the one waitress that was working. The kitchen is open-concept and it seems to be run by one person as well.

Despite my worries that food will take forever, my beef chimichanga arrived fast and piping hot! (See picture for the size of that thing) It came with a side of salsa rice, retried beans and nachos. You have a choice of mild, medium or hot. This whole plate was only around $13, and I packed half to take home for dinner. My friends chicken burrito was equally as big - we could have shared just one..

This place is slightly hidden as the signage isn't too obvious when walking by, but definitely give it a shot if you want to try some authentic Mexican cuisine for a great price!"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican Food! Honestly, the best authentic food in the GTA! food is tasty, service is great, and atmosphere is welcoming. I am of Mexican heritage, and ive been to MANY \"Mexican\" restaurants in the city...only to be disappointed. This place serves up meals that are full of spice and taste. I would recommend asking your server to up the \"spice\" level if you are someone that likes a little bit of spice!"}
{"text":"I came here with a girlfriend. We ordered the platter for two - four tacos and one burrito. Plenty of food. And it's delicious!!! Prices were reasonable. Service was friendly and prompt. Not a very big place. It's a great addition to the strip."}
{"text":"The waitress didn't have a system, we waited and she gave someone else OUR TABLE we waited 20mins for. That should have been the first sign to leave.

One of the grossest things I have ever ate. Everything was bland and tasted the same..... I couldn't even eat after the first bite. The beans were old and especially the tomatoes in the salad (so bad). DO NOT GET THE CHICKEN! 

One of the worst places ever."}
{"text":"To start the place itself is very cute. It's a small restaurant and it's decorated very nicely to fit in with the unionville theme. One thing I found about this place is that service is incredibly slow. I ordered the nachos which were really nice and had a lot of meat but by the time it came out it spoilt it for me. I had to ask our waitress several times if the food was ready and it wasn't even that busy. I would come again but il make sure I'm not too hungry next time."}
{"text":"A breath of fresh air on Unionville Main Street. Friendly staff, generous and delicious portions and cozy, warm ambience. Great to hear festive music on a cold and blustery day. Love the quesadillas, guacamole and burritos in particular. Have been a dozen times or more as I work at the end of the street.  The owners are very generous and care about the community and customers they serve too. I love supporting independent restaurants as I'm not a big fan of large chain, generic restaurants. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"We tried this place for lunch, and while it's a decent place for Mexican food, it's not anything to go out of your way for. The guacamole was surprisingly bland. I'm not even sure how you mess up guacamole, since I'll eat an avocado by itself and be happy, but there you go. The chips weren't very fresh and considering they just opened when we got there, that was perplexing.

The chicken Sopes Mexicanos were also disappointing. They just weren't very flavourful. I don't even remember tasting much of the pico de gallo. I had to add hot sauce to make it taste like something.

The beef enchiladas were good, however. By far the most flavourful dish I tried. Perhaps if we'd stuck to the entr√©es we would have had better luck."}
{"text":"Seriously my \"go to\" Mexican restaurant. Their fish taco is amazing. I've had their other dishes on the menu but I have an addiction to fish taco. I also love their homemade habanero sauce is so good... I would finish half a bottle each visit. I always get the guacamole even though it's not the greatest but I'm usually starving when I get there and the food and service is slow so I get that to munch on while I wait and it keeps my hangriness at bay so I'm more bearable to those around me."}
{"text":"We both really loved it! I am surprised that this place isn't maintaining a four star review.  It's definitely not because of the food, because it was delicious.

The food isn't your average Mexican, they put in effort to season their meats and put effort into the presentation.  

Would recommend to all!"}
{"text":"The best Mexican restaurant here in Markham. The chimichangas and chicken tacos stand out from what we had there. I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I'm going to start by saying that this review is NOT a 4 star review, it's in fact a 4.5 star review, and if I hadn't been eating on the go and had a chance to take in the full experience it would likely be even higher, so ill let you all know that ill be back... Soon. 

Now for the part you've all been waiting for, what is Planeta Mexico? Well folks (and I hope residents of Markham and Unionville are listening) PM is the newest Mexican restaurant on Main Street in Unionville! And it's good... Like amazingly good. Ill go a step further and say that this spot is serving up the best Mexican in Markham. Final. 

They've only been open 48 hours so I was excited when I heard festive music coming from the opens doors and food coming out of the kitchen that made my mouth water instantly. I HAD to have it. 

I was in a hurry so my meal was \"to go\" so as I mentioned before I didn't get a full experience, but from what I experienced, I was amazed. 

I ordered the combo platter for 2 ($20) which came with 4 freshly made soft tacos (the tortillas are made fresh in house daily) and a burrito. I had the tacos done with chicken and the burrito in beef. 

As things were being made fresh, it was a 20 minute wait, so I made use of that time by meeting the staff, looking at all the food as it passed me and.... As heck, I had a sangria while I killed some time. 

Note to reader, if you're so lucky as to have a PM sangria anytime you're waiting for anything, you're lucky. They are outstanding!

As for the food, there really aren't words, it's best that you take a trip to Unionville yourself and experience it. Perfectly cooked, large portions, fresh, hot, DELICIOUS. 

Make it to Main Street before this place gets too busy. 

Adios!! 

(Written on the go from the yelp mobile app)"}
{"text":"Was greeted by really friendly lady upon entering and seated promptly during lunch time (they weren't busy at all). I ordered the steak enchiladas (12.50 I believe, not bad at all compared to other restaurants on main st!), with the green (mild sauce). My order was also served with rice and 3 tortilla chips dipped in beans. Portion is fantastic, just enough to make you full but not so much that you can't stand up. The enchiladas were very good, the mild sauce was not hot at all which is great for me since I am a baby when it comes to spiciness but for the more adventurous you can ask for their really hot sauce which I'm told will burn your mouth until the end of the meal. Overall I am really pleased with my experience here, and will likely return if I get a mexican craving, especially since there aren't really good mexican places in the markham/unionville area beyond taco bell and burritos. 

BONUS: clean and homely washrooom!!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food, but nice atmosphere with live singing and if you're lucky.

I went with friends and was delighted to see a mariachi singer who was quite friendly and interactive coming around to each table singing, definitely the highlight of the night!

The food was good. I'm not complaining, but it didn't blow me away. I had the shrimp chimichanga- tiny little shrimp but maybe had like 20 of them in there. The sauce wasn't too hot and I got the hot. It was average at best. But portion sizes were amazing!! I ate half of mine and was full! 

If there sauce was spicier and flavourful that would make it 4* at least! Polite service.

They did give me a bottle of habenero sauce to try which was spicy- they should make something like that- or mix fresher habenero sauce in with the hot sauce to kick it up a notch. 

I would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"This restaurant opened roughly a week ago and has some good things going for it: 1) Friendly family atmosphere (not a quiet date place), 2) Low prices and 3) good tacos.

Service was excellent, the small restaurant had roughly 4-5 servers who worked as a team ensuring you had what you needed.

Given the Unionville location, I expected higher prices. To my surprise, all entrees were about $12 - $13. A huge platter of Nachos with fresh toppings was just $8.50.      

Located in a converted small country home with Mexican decorations and artifacts provided some authenticity to the decor. It was very busy on a Sunday night but they organized the tables so you can get some privacy. Note - lot's of young family's with children, it got very loud!

My review of the food is mixed...

- Nachos were good with incredibly fresh tomatoes and Jalape√±os. A good proportion of well melted cheese was provided.

- The tacos were good and the tortillas freshly made - a nice touch. You can get shrimp, beef, chicken or fish (tilapia). Although you get three tacos per serving, you cant mix them up - all three have to be exactly the same. That makes no sense and contrary to all other Mexican restaurants I visited.

- The chicken Mole was a real disappointment. They used large chunks of chicken breast that was incredibly dry. I honestly had difficulty cutting the large chunks of meat. The mole sauce had the usual hint of cocoa but definitely needed some kick.

As I looked around, everyone was adding bottled hot sauce to their dishes (provided on the tables). I get the sense they are keeping the heat levels low for the \"general public\".  I suggest providing different spice options at the time of ordering.

I don't want to be too harsh as every new restaurant needs some time to work out the kinks. The place definitely shows potential (why I'm going with 3 stars) but they need to bring the spice levels up and get rid of the \"Henry Ford Model T\" policy of ordering tacos. 

PS - please adjust cooking time for the chicken (Chicken Mole).

BK"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday ~service was really nice and polite, 

 It was a bit chilly inside the restaurant the good thing is that the waitress noticed I was cold and offered to turn up the heat for me which was really nice of her. 
 
I ordered platter for two for $25 and the burrito in the platter was soooooo  good !!  The tacos were so-so wasn't that good.  But I'm seriously gonna come back just for the burrito.. 

Also ordered churros not sure how much it was but... It was so goddamn good..... I love it.  It was hot and so mouth watering even after eating one.. Not to mention I was so stuffed already from the platter...

Anyway  definetly will be back for the burrito and churros !!"}
{"text":"I don't normally update reviews, but this place seems to have really gone down hill. After we were seated, we needed to go find a waitress since they had forgotten about us. Later, I saw another couple do the same.

We had some terrible mojitos. They were served in giant glasses, so they tasted terribly watered down. I've never seems a restaurant do this before and for good reason.

I also didn't enjoy my chicken enchiladas. I know some folks prefer dark meat chicken, but I'm not really a fan and I think they should have had the option for white meat or at least stated the use of dark meat on the menu. On my previous visits, I believe they used white meat.

Not sure I will return again."}
{"text":"Came in for a weekday dinner with a couple of friends, it's a cute place, small and tucked away on main st unionville. 

I ordered the enchiladas with the spicy aztec sauce. I can usually take spice when it comes to food but this was pretty spicy! I kept taking sips of sangria in between to curb the spice levels. The enchiladas were ok, pretty flavorful but didn't have much depth. It came with beans (and 2 homemade chips), rice (nothing special) and pico de gallo. Next time I would order apps and drinks instead of the main, the homemade chips were delicious and I want to try their guacamole. Portions were big."}
{"text":"Another disappointment not authentic, servings are not good size. Great location.... Ok Enough of this review."}
{"text":"Fantastic food .. Super huge portions well done keep it up great service and my kids love the place"}
{"text":"SERVICE: Horrible. I went for lunch on a Sunday. I was a party of 2. The waitress took our order and when the food was ready she delivered it. After that, she had not come back to check up on us. We had to go inside and ask for the bill (we were sitting outside). We also had to go inside to ask for more water. 

FOOD: The portions were large. Come hungry. If you are not hungry, don't order an appetizer. We had a chicken burrito and beef enchiladas. We loved the large portions and food was decent. Warning: lot's of sauce is put on top of the burrito, enchiladas, etc. it's really saucy. 

VERDICT: I would not come back because there was no service after we received our food. You have to hunt someone down. The food is not good enough for me to want to go back."}
{"text":"I came here with a bunch of friends and we had an amazing time. The food was amazing and the service was good. I ordered the Chimichanga with steak and it was fabulous. It tasted like authentic Mexican food you would purchase in Mexico or other Central American countries. 

I also got to try the nachos, which were amazing and the churros. The churros were fabulous. I just had a small bite because they do have gluten. 

All of the tortillas are made with corn so they are gluten free. This put my mind to ease because I knew I could buy any of the entrees at the restaurant.

I also sampled the ice cream (just a bite) and the cherry flavored one was to die for. 

I would highly recommend checking out Planeta Mexico. I would also recommend making an afternoon out of it before the weather gets too cold. Unionville is such a cute place and I was dying to walk around and check out the shops."}
{"text":"I honestly didn't know this restaurant was here! Somehow just always walked by without realizing there was some pretty awesome Mexican food right by my house!

Came on my brother's suggestion and was pleasantly surprised by the cute little restaurant. And by little, I mean like 7-8 tables, tops! It was a really nice environment as there was a live music playing mariachi music! 

Got seated after waiting a couple minutes, and ordered pretty quickly. Got the 4 Tacos and a Burrito to share for 2 people, and was actually very filling! We chose fish for the tacos and beef for the burrito. The Fish Tacos were amazing, with a huge piece of fish. I could even completely wrap the taco! The burrito ended up being a nice contrast with the first, but was crazy packed and tasted amazing!

Unfortunately the service was a bit slow. They had 2 servers for the tiny space, but it still seemed to take forever to get things. Didn't get much check up on our table, and she ended up giving us back the wrong amount of change... She was very sweet and friendly, but it just felt that the service was a bit lacklustre. 

A good price for some great Mexican food, so definitely worth looking into. Hopefully the service is better on other days."}
{"text":"Went here with some friends for dinner. We got the taco/burrito for 2 which includes 4 tacos and 1 burrito to share. As usual, can select between beef, shrimp, chicken etc for stuffing. We got fish tacos as they are apparently the most popular. Definitely did not disappoint. The fish was so yummy and crispy! The beef burrito was alright, what you would expect in any burrito. 

We also got the Nacho Grande to share with chicken on top. Very big portion, lots of cheese and toppings so was super yummy. Nacho chips were nice and crispy. 

Overall, very big portions (good for sharing and good prices)"}
{"text":"Went here on a Tuesday. Took a while to sit down. There were plenty of tables, so we just sat down at a dirty table and waited a good 10 minutes for someone to clean it. Ordering a bucket of beer, took another 20 minutes. The service is horrendously slow. The food took another 30 minutes to come even though it was a fairly simple order. But like everyone here reviewed, the service is not the reason to go here. 

Now onto the food... We got the platter for two. It comes with 4 tacos and 1 burrito, side of rice, beans and the Pico de gallo. The beans are delicious, and the pico de gallo is really fresh. The rice was nothing special. Absolutely the best side dishes I ate in a very long time. The tacos were also very fresh. Had the pastor and the fish. The beef burrito was covered in feta with some sour cream based sauce. The food tastes great, with a mix of flavours. Brings me back to my Mexico travels. They have the \"spicy\" sauce, which is fairly mild. It does have a bit of kick to it, and a really good smoky flavour, but it is not spicier than Tabasco or Sriracha. There are side spicy sauces made from jalape√±os, but those also were not spicy. For a Mexican place, I would have expected some sweat. On the other hand, the sauces do taste great and lots of flavour.

The prices are also great! You'll be looking to spend about 14$ per person for food, which is very decent for such a nice location.

I would definitely visit this place again, the food is great. I would usually expect a siesta after the meal, but it seems that maybe you should do it while waiting for your orders."}
{"text":"I came here with my brother for a birthday dinner. The atmosphere is casual and friendly. 

My brother is a huge wuss when it comes to spice so we went with mild on everything, as we were sharing. I sadly grabbed one of the tabletop hot sauces and the server came by and said \"is that for you?\" Then she brought over three little jars of their own hot sauce and explained them to me.

They were all absolutely delicious.

We had the steak enchiladas and the pastor flautas. Steak enchiladas were okay, I am very rarely happy with steak when I order it at restaurants, but we wanted to give it a shot. The pastor was incredible... crispy, flavourful, perfect.

We also ordered tortillas and guacamole. The tortillas all seemed to be fresh made.

I can't stop raving about this place. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"What a quaint and lively little restaurant along Main St. Unionville! With a live Mariachi player serenading us with his acoustic guitar and folklore songs, what can go wrong?! .. Except of course, you have to scream to hear your friends because he's too loud. (It's definitely a great atmosphere, but I think he needs to take it down a notch so I can actually have conversations at my table!)

I came here with a handful of friends for a birthday celebration so we each ordered a dish along with shared appetizers. The portions for everything were super filling and really tasty! I'm a big fan of Mexican food and I really loved the authenticity of the food here. I would highly recommend the nachos, which were overflowing with toppings, but I would also warn you of the spicy jalapeno peppers in it! I shared the Taco Burrito Platter for 2 with a friend and the burrito was stuffed to the brim with the filling of our choice (which was chicken). For the tacos, I got baja fish and it was deep-fried to a light crisp. I really liked that there were sliced radishes to add a nice crunch and the sauce that was drizzled on top was very creamy and tangy. 

This restaurant seems to get very busy in the evenings, especially on warm summer nights. They have an open patio, which I love, and I'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I was here several years ago and thought this place was going to go out of business with the quality/taste of food that they served.  However, some how not only were they still in business this summer, they seem to have a lot of people enjoying the patio and the food.  I thought I would give it another try.   It was a bad idea.  They were out of guacamole.  Hello??  How's that possible for a Mexican restaurant?  Their food again was bland.  Other than the location, I honestly don't understand why people would go to this restaurant."}
{"text":"We were seated inside the restaurant at a table that had a perfect view of the performer's area.  I was pleasantly surprised that such a small restaurant would have a stage for someone to play live music.  Alas, this wasn't a night of scheduled performances so the stage was left empty.

The Guacamole Ranchero was a traditional mashed avocado dip served with tortilla chips and salsa.  This arrived with some of the tortilla chips placed separately in another basket.  Meanwhile, the mashed avocado dip was a really big portion surrounded by a select few tortilla chips which made it look like a beaming sun.  It was a neat way to serve the Guacamole Ranchero. 

I felt that this Guacamole Ranchero was a little too sour for my taste.  There was a lot of tomatoes, lemon juice, and onions in it for sure and they sure didn't skimp out on the avocado either.  The tortilla chips were extremely crunchy and crispy.

All of their entr√©es were served with Mexican rice, refried beans, and pico de gallo with a choice of green (mild), red (medium), or aztec (spicy) sauce.  I chose the Enchiladas.  I chose medium heat for my sauce.  The Enchiladas included three rolled tortillas stuffed with a choice of chicken, beef, pastor, veggies, steak, fish, or shrimp.  It was served with mozzarella, sour cream, and feta.  For my order, I chose fish.  The red sauce turned out to be a little spicy, with the heat lingering for a little while after the first bite.

The refried beans were pretty good.  I especially liked how there were a few tortilla chips stuck into the refried beans which not only made its presentation a nice one but also the chips were thus warmed up and less crunchy as a result (the chips were actually too crunchy for my taste).  The tomatoes in the pico de gallo were fresh.  I found that the Enchiladas were a little soggy especially with the already soggy-tasting fish inside the rolled tortilla.  Otherwise, I did like the mozzarella and sour cream on top of it.

The Taco a la Parrilla also was served with Mexican rice, refried beans, and pico de gallo with a choice of sauce.  This entr√©e included three soft tacos stuffed with a choice of chicken, beef, pastor, veggies, steak, fish, or shrimp.  K chose shrimp for this one.

This plate was again very colourful and I loved the look of it.  I enjoyed the shrimp in the tacos in this one more.  The shrimps were grilled nicely and had some flavour to them.  The soft taco shells weren't to my liking; I found them too soft and grainy."}
{"text":"I honestly don't know how this restaurant received higher ratings than my experience. The food was horrible to say the least, we ordered the soft tacos and it was so bland there was no flavour in the chicken, beans were dried and rice had absolutely no flavour. Second dish was sizzling steak topped with cheese, the steak was overcooked and so dry gosh what a disappointment. 

Food court Mexican food hands down tastes way better than this restaurant, disappointing to say. 

We went here on a Saturday prime afternoon and there were only 6 tables in the entire restaurant yet the service was bad. Our waitress came to take our order, brought our food and that was it. Never came back to check up on us. We would never go back as we only went since my family lives nearby and we always wanted to give this place a try.

If you're looking for authentic Mexican food then go somewhere else or food court tastes way better than this place."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing and the service is super fast. I usually get the chicken mole and a margarita and it always tastes like it should. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty bland. And the service was absolutely horrible. The waitress complained several times that she couldn't handle the workload. Took us asking for water four times before we got it. Also our orders were somehow less important then other people who.came after us. Over all the worst."}
{"text":"Love it!!!! Been here twice wish we can come all the time.  There was no one in the restaurant and then it finally filled up."}
{"text":"I was eager to try this Mexican restaurant. I look at the menu and there wasn't a lot of choices and I picked a hot plate dish for $20 but I can't remember the name. The chicken was so dry I had a hard time to swallow it. Then I had to get some guacamole 
to eat with it. The place was very interesting. It had a feel of mexico with the spanish music on. The service was good so I tip her 15%. Although I didn't like it this time but I will try it again in few weeks."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if this was a fluke or what but our experience here wasn't really good at all.

Actually the food itself would get a solid 3 stars but service where it all fell apart!

First off I admit, I never like to eat in a residential house converted to a restaurant unless it's been totally redone, which is unfortunately not the case in Planeta Mexico's locale. The conversion isn't the best as the raised level dining area and a very residential bathroom don't really lend themselves to a commercial eatery but I guess some will give it a \"cute\" factor of sorts.

Main problem is no one here apparently been trained to wait tables! Don't get me wrong, they are all nice, pleasant people but:

- Orders came at different times.
- Items were missing.
- No one ever checked on us to see what we need or refiled drinks.
- No uniforms, each person is wearing whatever they please.

The biggest issue was when they moved us mid meal to make room for a group booking! Tip: If you know you have a group booking, get your dining room in order and block tables ahead of time. 

They first moved us to a corner and blocked us with all the tables for the group with literally no way to get out easily without disturbing a bunch of people! Seeing this, I asked them to move us somewhere where we could at least get out which they obliged. The gentleman who I believe is the owner (based on the Yelp photos) was present and helping his staff rearranging the tables but never bothered to come over and apologize to us.

I thought this was annoying but when that poor group showed up, they crammed two extra chairs at both ends of the long chain of 4 or 5 tables to manage to accommodate them! That's sharing a 2 person table (Which is on the  smallish side already) between 3 people! It looked so horrible I actually felt pity on whoever made the booking and couldn't help but chuckle at what awaited them service wise.

Note to the owner: If you're reading this, and if you care about your business, please hire professional staff and not your family and friends! Your food is good, even if your location is a bit awkward but you must have proper service to go along with your food! Watch some Restaurant Impossible and you can indeed improve this business and bring in even more revenue. Last but not lease, if you inconvenience guests to accommodate additional business, at the very least you should come over and explain why you're doing so and apologize for the interruption."}
{"text":"This was truly a disappointing experience. For such a small restaurant, the live musician was too loud that you could not hold a conversation. Kudos on being enthusiastic though.

I had the Sopes Mexicanos with half Chorizo and half Chicken. They looked nothing like the pictures on the menu, and the bottom was so tough I could not even cut it with a fork and knife. The chicken was so bland, and the chorizo wasn't even real chorizo. My boyfriend had the Gorditos with Pastor, and that too had no flavour, just a lot of pineapples. 

Between the noise, the food, & the wobbly table, it made for a very disappointing date night."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is crowded and really loud on a busy day. Food took quite a while to be made but did not mind that however I asked for a beef burrito and I got chicken for some reason. Didn't ask for a replacement because the wait would have been even longer and I just wanted to eat. Quality of the food is just average but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Average mexican food. I get the sense that they are trying really hard but after just getting back from Scottsdale this is really food court quality food. No chips and salsa when you sit down. I ordered some and they were store bought chips not homemade. They came with a tiny amount of pico de gallo and the chips were stale. We ordered chimichangas which were ok. One thing I really didn't  like was that when you order steak its actually shredded beef. I would have preferred skirt or flank steak. Tacos were ok, enchilads ok but just average. Of note, 3 of our dishes were made incorrectly- this seems to be a common problem with the kitchen. Prices were reasonable, however $6.50 for a bottled beer seemed pricey. The decor is pretty lame, plastic school chairs on some tables and \"garage sale\" style wooden chairs on other tables. I was hoping for better and let's hope the owners make changes and improve things. Made In Mexico in Newmarket is far far superior."}
{"text":"We called few days ago to book a reservation for 17 people.  We were told no  reservation and confirmed they were able to seat table of 17 people for dinner.  All we have to do is come in at that date.  

We came 30 mins early and guess what.  The waitress at the door gave a shock face when we ask for a table for 17 then she check the list and guess what I see on table.... Reserved signs. 

So my cousins goes into explain how she called and confirms the restaurant ability to handle 17 people and if reservation was available. 

Not only did they not apologize for giving false information.. They gave a lame excuse \"they're just so many waitresses, they all can say something different so I don't know who you spoke to\". 

If the basic service is at this level the food services can't be far"}
{"text":"The location is great - located on Unionville Main Street, it's a good Mexican food option for those that frequent the area or are visiting for the first time. The restaurant is small but cozy and they have a small patio perfect for warmer days. When my friend and I went on a Friday for lunch, the place was empty - we were the only customers until a party of four entered towards the end of our meal. All tortilla entrees come with Mexican fried rice, refried beans, and pico de gallo. We ordered steak quesadillas ($11.50 excl. tax): a flour tortilla with feta cheese and chipotle sauce or sour cream and steak enchiladas ($13.50 excl. tax) with mild sauce: three rolled tortillas with feta and sour cream. My friend loved the steak quesadillas and would give them a 4/5. I thought the enchiladas were just okay - a 2.5 or 3/5 at best. The enchiladas' mild sauce was too sour in my opinion and because the enchiladas are covered with a generous amount of it (the amount is a good thing, the flavour of the salsa not so much), I didn't find myself enjoying the dish too much. Overall, Planeta Mexico is a good Mexican food place. The service is super friendly and accommodating. I'd go again if I was craving Mexican and happened to be on Main Street but it's not a place I'd seek out."}
{"text":"The photos say it all. Excellent Mexican food in Unionville. All their entrees can be made vegetarian!
Don't have to drive to Toronto."}
{"text":"I won't write off this place entirely but based on the tacos I had for lunch,  Planeta Mexico was entirely forgettable. 

We started with some nacho chips and guacamole which was sub-standard to start. The guacamole was fresh but it lacked substance and pop; it tasted rather bland and lacked chunkiness, namely speaking the tomatoes, onions, and corriander. Our entire table got three taco platters which included 9 tacos. 3 each which were beef and chicken and then the remaining 3 either shrimp or fish. This was a shame because the beef and chicken tacos weren't all that great and everyone agreed that we should have gotten all shrimp or fish if that was possible. The fish and shrimp tacos were by far the best ones. There was sweet creamy sauce which complimented the shrimp taco well, whereas the fish tacos had a large piece of crispy fish. The beef and chicken tacos were bland and lacked seasoning. The salsa Verde which was on some of the chicken tacos did nothing to the tacos. The nachos and Pico de Gallo were a nice addition to the platter. Service was fine and we had no problems. 

Overall, I'm not entirely sure what to make of Planeta Mexico. I can definitely see the potential here and maybe we just ordered the wrong things here?"}
{"text":"Sitting snugly in the middle of Main Street Unionville, I assumed this would be a mediocre tourist trap but wow what a surprise! Love my Mexican joints and was not expecting to find such a gem here.

From hearing the live Spanish music walking through the front doors to the festive decor of the place, I was immediately put in a cheery mood and ready for some Mexicano goodness. 

We came with a large group and to start we ordered all the apps on the menu - guac ($9.50), bean dip with chorizo ($8.50), Nacho grande ($9.5) and soles mexicano ($9.5) which are round corn doughs topped with fried beans, sour cream, feta & pico de gallo. Everything was fresh and tasty so can't go wrong with any of these but my fav must try is the bean dip - so flavourful and delicious with the chorizo! 

For the mains we also the whole variety from tacos, burritos, enchiladas and quesadillas. After sampling everything I definitely enjoyed my enchiladas with fish ($12.5) the most. Perfectly battered fish in warm tortilla and green mild sauce, it was bomb, highly recommend. All the mains came with seasoned fried rice and beans - so much food. The Pozole traditional corn soup was the only miss for me that night as it was bland and very passable.

Overall extremely reasonable price points for the quality and portion size. We were all SO stuffed by the end of it that we practically rolled out of the place. Will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"I have passed by this restaurant on numerous occasions. My husband & I love Mexican food and between the 2 of us, we have been to Mexico almost a dozen times. We were in Unionville last week and finally decided to give it a try. 

This is what we ordered:

Flautos rancheros (chicken) - dry, no flavour, not even a sauce or salsa to dip the items into. The salad had 6 drops of white dressing or sour cream. I couldn't tell you because they were so small it was almost as if they were accidentally dropped on the salad. The tortilla's the flautos were wrapped with were tough to eat & very oily. Also came with rice & refried beans that were so thick & pasty i could barely take the tortilla chip inserted into it out of it. 

Enchiladas (chicken) - same taste as the flautos - and I mean EXACTLY the same - same chicken with no flavour or seasoning. Same sides, rice, beans etc. These were also very dry, it's supposed to come with sauce poured over them, but they put so little it's barely visible - which is sad because the little amount that was added tasted good. 

Taco a la parillo (steak)- the steak looked like it was boiled. It was so rubbery & tough I couldn't even chew it & swallow what I was eating. They added radish & pickled cabbage & lettuce as the toppings - which i've never seen in Mexican food. Again there was no sauce or anything to give the dish any flavour or make you want to eat the 2nd or 3rd one on the plate. Same beans, salad & rice - thick pasty, wilted blackened lettuce & old rice that tasted like it had been reheated over & over.

One thing that bugged me the most was feta cheese is sprinkled on everything! No sauce for flavour, no seasoning in the meat, chicken etc., but feta everywhere. I had better food at Taco Bell the next day. Very disappointing meal - each meal had 3 pieces, we ate less than 1/3 of each dish and then tossed everything out. There's is nothing that will take me back to this restaurant ever again. One star is way too generous, but I had to rate it with something."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend last night because we were supposed to check it out a few months ago.  I feel bad but it was not a good experience, they were really understaffed so please keep that in mind.

The food was good but nothing different than any other Mexican place.

What really did me over was the service though.  We got our guacamole without napkins or cutlery, no biggie.  Then when our mains came I asked for napkins and cutlery and the waitress acknowledged.  5 mins went by and nothing, 7 mins nothing.  My friend went to an empty table and took the cutlery from it for us.  The waitress then poked her head out and saw us but didn't even acknowledge we had cutlery already.  How can you forget that???? The other table ordered water and got it in under a minute.

I like my service and really want to support the small mom and pop stores but......"}
{"text":"This is a quaint, small authentic Mexican restaurant. They have a small patio and a limited menu. If you are expecting  old El paso or Mexicana  type Mexican food you will be sorely disappointed. They serve authentic food here. soft flur tacos and deep fried tacos and flautillas. It's usually pretty busy here as the place is small  and cosy. There is a tiny little music corner, where I can only assume they have live music, however I have never heard it. They usually play Mexican bongo tunes on the stereo. Waitresses are usually speedy and pleasant. It's nice to go to a decent Mexican place where you get decent food, instead of taco bell. Plus they all speak English"}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is very nice and quaint albeit small but it adds to its charm. 

We ordered apps to start and got guacamole and chips. The guacamole was great however half of the chips were stale. I was hungry so I didn't care too much but it was definitely off putting. 

On to the main dish, I ordered a typical Burrito Mojado with steak filling. These burritos are massive and are definitely filling and flavourful. One suggestion would be offer whole wheat instead of the white tortilla. 

We also ordered sangria, which was a tad pricey for the amount we got and it didn't have any punch (and by punch I mean alcohol). Either that's a testament to well they mix it or they just weren't adding enough. 

Overall, the atmosphere was good and my main meal was filling and tasty. Another party member had the Chicken Mole as it was something different and was surprisingly tasty. Will probably try that next time."}
{"text":"Planeta Mexico opened up a few years ago in the heart of Main Street Unionville.  The cute quaint casita/casona (small house) is serving up some homemade Mexican food to locals in this neck of the woods. 
Interior is very home-like with all the bells and whistles that display Mexican heritage; colorful walls, old Mexican paintings, music, etc.
Coming here after a movie both JC and I decided to have a drink, she with the margarita and I with the Modelo Negra.  What we thought was a great experience, we were quite disappointed.

From the get-go, after standing for more than 5 mins without a line up were were only seated.
secondly after being seated it took another 5-10mins for the person to take our drink order. 
Thirdly our appetizer (Nachos) came well before our drinks which was a Modelo Negra cerveza and a lime margarita....not sure how that was.

On a positive note, the nachos were well portioned, delish, but I still couldn't figure out why the service was terrible.  I've been other other great Mexican restaurants in the GTA, this was an 'alright experience'"}
{"text":"Best Mexican in the GTA so far!

Try the mole - it's AWESOME!"}
{"text":"i've never been really impressed with any of the restaurants right at Unionville, but they do offer some great patios and people watching.

I've been to Planeta Mexico a few times and have decided that you come to enjoy the patio and ok mexican food. The service here is just terrible and non existent. Each time i visited i choose to sit outside on the patio, and i'm not sure if the servers forget about the patrons out there, but it always seems so disorganized and they never know who's covering what tables. 

On our last visit there i had to ask for water 3 times from a different server each time. Our nachos came out quickly. About 10 minutes later we had to remind the server we ordered a beer and a mojito. 30 minutes later tables around us that came after us started getting their foods too. We inquired about our Gorditas that have yet to come and the server said \"wait. The kitchen is busy. it's coming\" 10 minutes later our gorditas came out. 

we were kind of tired of chasing the servers around everytime we needed something so we decided to leave shortly after. We asked yet ANOTHER server if we could get our bill, and her exact reply as she was heading back into the restaurant \"I'll try. What table are you? 22?\" 

they just seem so disorganized and uncaring and no sense of urgency with their service. The food is not bad though...."}
{"text":"I came to this place when it first opened in Markham and it was amazing. The flavours were bright and fresh, especially during a hot summer day. The owners are Mexican, I believe, and they were testing a new dish which we had to try (ceviche). It was fresh raw fish that is slightly cooked by the acid from lemon and lime juice and mixed like a salad with peppers and mango. It had a refreshing salad feel with a bit of spice. Perfect dish but never made it to their menu. 

Their staff are all super nice and are patient enough to give you suggestions based on your taste. 

Their drinks on a hot summer day are a freshing mix of margaritas, sangrias, mojitos and beer. Combine that with their atmosphere and decor, this place teleports me to Miami because I haven't actually been to Mexico lol. 

\"One year later..\"
Chimichangas are one of my favourite Mexican foods and they do it pretty well here. It comes with a brick of chimichanga with rice, beans, and corn all of which are kind of bland. Their tortillas are okay and far from the best I've had. What really makes their food good here in general is their hot sauces which bring out the flavour of the food. Their food is a vessel for their hot sauces basically.

\"Two years later..\"
Their tacos are inconsistent. One day I'll get big piece of fish in my taco and another day there'd be literally a ball of deep fried dough with a spec of fish I'd have to dig for to find. Once my friend ordered 4 tacos, all fish and the portion of fish between each taco varied drastically. 

Though the restaurant seems to be heading the wrong direction, if you're in Markham craving Mexican I think this is your best bet but don't expect to be blown away. The service is still great after a few years."}
{"text":"I was meaning to try this place for quite a long time. Finally made it last might. The place was very busy and we did not have a reservation but we were willing to wait the 20 to 30 minutes we were told it would be before a table was available. 

After only a few minutes, we were seated. The gentleman who seated us, I'm assuming he is the owner, was extremely nice and friendly. 

The dining area is close and a bit noisy but it works in this place. You get a sense of energy and celebration. The decor is chintzy and charming at the same time. A mixture of cacti, adobe, and Mexican memorabilia that make you forget you're on Unionville Main Street. 

For a while there was a singer with a guitar strolling from table to table singing Mexican songs. I thought that was a fun touch. 

From our table I could see the flurry of activity in the kitchen. The plates are generous and very appealing to the eye. 

Unfortunately, the Mole Poblano that I ordered was very dry. The chicken was tough and the sauce lacked flavor. I tried a little of my husband's chimichanga. It was very spicy as he requested, but again, it was bland under all that heat. The portions were huge, though and I thought the service was very good."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible service! 

Had to place our order for drinks twice.  But when they did come out they were prepared well. Margaritas were tasty and served in trendy mason jars with a salted rim.

A waitress came by to take our food order shortly after. We ordered the fish tacos and the flautas. About 15 minutes later we were asked if we were ready to order by a different waitress! After explaining to her that we already ordered she assured us the food would be out shortly. Another 35 minutes later the second waitress came by to ask for our order again!! She explained the order was never even placed to the kitchen but that our food would be out in 5 minutes after we told her what we wanted. 

I don't mind waiting for 50 minutes for food when it legitimately takes that long to prepare. But when it takes 5 minutes to prepare and the other  45 minutes was wasted I was understandably upset. Nonetheless we reiterated our order. But after waiting another 20 minutes without even a status update on our dishes we got up and left.

I don't care how good the food might be if they don't value people's time I can't be bothered to eat there.

I will not be recommending this restaurant to friends and family."}
{"text":"I ate here yesterday with my family, it was good I liked the enchiladas and the quesidea , I've been waiting for some decent Mexican food in Markham. service was also really good, but it was very not busy at the time so that may have been why."}
{"text":"I had the taco parilla and it was small. Tasted good but there wasn't much of it. Why so skimpy with the rice?  3 tortilla chips? Really?  Having waited for 30 minutes for the food I expected much more and better. 

The worst part is the loud Latino beats music where every song sounds exactly the same. Of course they have to blast it. My two year old says, \"it's too loud!\".  \"Yes dear it is too loud!\"  

Overall a very distasteful dining experience.  I couldn't wait to get out and I'm still hungry. Sigh."}
{"text":"Planeta Mexico serves authentic Mexican food.  We ordered the taco and burrito platter for two ($20) which came with 4 tacos and 1 burrito.  We got to choose 2 flavours for taco and 1 flavour for burrito.  The chicken tacos were better than the fish tacos, which were a bit dry.  The beef burrito was standard but it could be bigger for sure.  The beans, salsa and rice that came with the platter were really good.  

Price wise Planeta Mexico is pricier than all the other Mexican restaurants I have been to.  For example, it costs $12.50 for 3 tacos at Planeta, while it usually costs $10 for 3 tacos at other places.  This is a 25% price premium, though it is understandable due to the location.

The homemade green chili sauce is to die for, and it tastes exactly like the one I had in Southern California.  In fact, the food at Planeta Mexico tastes like the standard Mexican food you can get in Southern California, not much better or worse.  This is where it hurts, that the typical standard in Southern California is regarded as so good and authentic in Toronto.  It speaks volume about the lower standard of Mexican food in Toronto.  

I give it 4 stars because it is authentic and convenient.  The service is friendly."}
{"text":"3.5/5

This review is for the little ice cream booth they have attached to their restaurant. 

We were walking down mainstreet when we noticed that they were selling churros and obviously, we had to try some. We ordered their combo of 4 churros + ice cream for $5. They had a lot of ice cream flavours to choose from, we decided on blueberry cheesecake. It was a tough choice between that and black cherry. 

It was my first time trying churros so I have nothing to compare it to, but they were pretty good. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. They had chocolate and caramel sauce (which we opted out of) to drizzle overtop of the churros. The ice cream was good, nothing special. 

In terms of service, the person working the register and making the churros wasn't the best. He seemed to have trouble managing taking orders whilst making churros. He also didn't ask us to pay in the end. He stood there after handing us our order. The sign said it was $5 for churros + ice cream but I wasn't sure if that was with tax or without. I handed him $5 and he took it without saying anything. It was a bit of a strange transaction. Other than that, it was a pleasant visit. The churros were freshly made on the spot and the ice cream was tasty."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars
Soft shell taco's with steak was subpar. Came with rice and beans. The rice had a unique taste to it as it was seasoned with something but I can't put my finger on how to describe it. Tortilla with sour cream and cheese was decent. Foodwise nothing really stood out, however the service was great. The place is small and it was a warm day outside so they kept the door open for better ventilation. A bee flew in and was hovering all over our food. The waitress noticed and came to our rescue. She swatted the bee away with a menu and it landed on the floor. She then put in the final blow with the bottom of her shoe. (My Hero :) (+0.5 stars for the bee disposal)"}
{"text":"My fiance and I had a nice dining experience here once before so thought to visit again the first weekend in June, on a saturday.

Doing some shopping on Main St, we stopped in to inquire if we could make reservations for later that evening (three hours later).  

The owner, in front of patrons and staff starts mocking us for asking what apparently was an insane question in his small mind.  Listen, we know it was a Saturday, we know you have a small space, however we were just inquiring.  Is that how an owner treats customers for asking to visit his restaurant??  Needless to say we left and will never return.  You're not the only gig in town pops."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. 
First time trying this place and wasn't impressed. The server took awhile to take our orders after giving us menus then when we received our drinks she almost dropped the Corona. After receiving our food, she never came back to check on us and it took forever to get the bill as well. 

Food was average. We ordered: Chicken Quesadilla and Shrimp Enchiladas. Portion was pretty big for lunch and is shareable if you don't eat a lot. It comes with rice and refried beans - both didn't taste that good to be honest. 

Patio - is decent but small. There are tons of flies and bees around there so not the best to be eating out there. 

Overall - Would not come back here. Service was disappointing or should I say \"what service\" .. and food was just meh not worth coming back for."}
{"text":"I was going to give this 1 star, but their guacamole rancheros was decent, however still not enough to salvage the rest of the meal. 

The service was extremely slow - there were only 3 tables with guests, but it took about 35 minutes for food to come out. I had the tacos with chicken, and it was one of the most disgusting things I've ever eaten. The chicken itself had absolutely zero flavour - it tasted as if they boiled the chicken in water, and threw it in a taco. The waitress also did not bring our salsa, which made the tasteless taco even more tasteless. It was about a 10 minute wait until we saw the waitress again, so we just asked for the bill. I would not go back to this place, even if they paid me."}
{"text":"Came here last night and I don't know if it's because it was the first nice weather Friday might, but it was packed. The waitress was able to find a table for two when we arrived. The tables are placed close to one another and you sometimes feel like you are sharing a meal with the table next to you. We ordered the dinner for two with beef burrito, two chicken tacos and two shrimp tacos. It took a while for the food to arrive and when it did the waitress gave the side sauces to the table next to us ( they were surprised since they had finished eating). The beef burrito was good and the filling for the tacos were okay, but the tacos kept falling when we held them. The rice that came with it was also dry. At the end, we had to flag a waitress 3 times to let her know we were ready for the bill. Right after asking for the bill, another waitress came to our table to see if we wanted a drink refill ( a bit too late). There was even a mistake on our bill and she had to go change it. So we tried the restaurant, but I don't think we will return.  Many more choices in unionville"}
{"text":"It was a 4. In general, the food and service were great. 

We really liked it here and it was so nice to sit in the patio area enjoying the sunshine and food. We asked for a seat by the patio and was seated immediately. 

Flautas Rancheras
Three deep fried tacos stuffed with your choice of chicken, beef, pastor, veggies, steak, fish or shrimp. I picked chicken but it would probably be better with the ground beef or veggies I think? I felt the chicken was too dry and there was not enough sour cream on mine. Just a few squiggly drips. This was more of a 3 for me. 

Himichanga
Deep fried Flour tortilla stuffed with your choice of chicken, beef, pastor, veggies, steak, fish or shrimp. Served with sour cream, feta and your choice of sauce:
Green (Mild), Red (Medium) or Aztec (Spicy). Hubby picked the beef. This was really good ! 4 stars! 

The waitress was nice and always made sure everything was ok. 

We will definitely be back as the atmosphere was great and we love being outside !"}
{"text":"Not authentic. Everything tastes the same and what the hell is with all the mozzarella cheese? Also... They should make their own sour mix, rather than store bought because I can taste it."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for the day to come in to this restaurant! Service is extremely slow, and the restaurant was not that busy. We waited about 1/2 hour for our food. We had to ask 3 different servers for water and they also gave us the wrong order ... Which we ate.

With that said. We ordered the 4 tacos and 1 burrito for $25. The fish tacos were by far our favourite as the beef tacos and the chicken burrito just had no taste and was not enjoyable whatsoever. 

Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I must disagree with most of the reviews I read before coming to this establishment this evening. My experience was not great, and I came out of my way to try it out, and was excited to try this new joint out. 

First off we were meeting another person, whom was there prior to our arrival, he said they haven't even asked for his drink order. We sat chatted pursued the menu chatted, and watched the service staff walk in and out of the dining area without giving us a glance. We chatted a bit more, finally I had to call a waitress over to take our order, she has obviously not worked in the service industry before, and I don't believe she was trained adequately to do so at this establishment. We had questions, she had the same questions to ask another server.

We ordered a quesadilla for our girls to share $11.50, we ordered the taco and burrito for two $25, which is an increase since previous reviews and their online menu. My father had a chicken Caesar $?. 

Two younger gentlemen came in while we placed our order, they ordered shortly after us. I can only imagine you know where this is going, and yes, they got their food before us. Not just a little bit before, like almost 20 min. From the time we had sat down, it was an hour later and we were still waiting on our food. By the time we got our food those guys had finished and almost out the door. 

Finally the moment of truth had come, was it worth the drive, was it worth an hour of sitting and waiting, the girls were starting to get restless. I took a bite of the beef taco first, first thought it's it's missing something, the beef itself had a bit of kick, but was dry and overall the taco was bland. Next up chicken burrito, a moderate upgrade I the flavor department from the taco. The strange thing they did with the burrito was cutting it into four pieces. The end pieces were easy to eat, but how do you eat a burrito with two open ends? I didn't figure it out, I made a mess. 

With a service staff in la la land and average food at best, I'd find it hard to recommend let alone come back. I was really hoping to love this place."}
{"text":"Probably not the best Mexican restaurant (see my review of mariachis) in toronto but pretty good and hey in Markham we have lots of things but Mexican restaurants aren't one of them!

We went for lunch and got the nachos to share. They were pretty yummy though I did find some cheese was not melted all the way through.. still delicious and huge kudos on the chips...these chips are amazing!!! So crunchy and flavorful!

For mains we had the taco platter to share and I had the shrimp chimichanga. Delicious and enormous portions. The  himichabga wasn't overly greasy or heavy but certainly filling. Loved the sides and the hot sauce at the table was blazing hot..have the tissues ready.

The restaurant itself is fun and festive if not a bit cramped. I've heard on weekends they have live bands and singers...definitely make your way down! For the portion sizes, quality of food and cost I'd say it's worth trying!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but the service was bad. They were disorganized and the table beside me kept having to ask for their drinks and eventually their meal. The food was okay, while i will say the presentation was very nice."}
{"text":"Flavour was sub par. The chips were oily and hurting the roof of my mouth. Burrito had too much beans. Steak in the burrito has no flavour. Guac was good though. Chicken tacos were not great. Lacking flavour overall"}
{"text":"Very mexican. Ordered the soft tacos pastor and it was really bland -- didn't have any sauce and such. But it was only later that I was told youre supposed to put your own hot sauce on it (I don't particularly like hot sauce) in order for it to be more flavourful. Guess this was the Mexican way! However I did get sour cream and man was that a game changer! All of a sudden the last bit of my dinner was amazing. So make sure you ask for sour cream! $12-13

There was a guy singing songs -- poor dude, it was freezing! Great service. Food came out quick and overall a very good portion."}
{"text":"The restaurant is actually really small and cozy. More like a little house with a big kitchen. 

Went here with a friend and tried their deep fried tacos with beef. Absolutely delicious. Their food was made fresh and it wasn't tortilla chips that they gave me as a side dish. They make their own chips and their own mole dips as well as rice. It kind of looked like Chinese fried rice. 

I'd definitely come back to try another dish. Its too bad I don't quite know how to pronounce the dishes in Spanish.. Ordering was really hard for me. It's OK! I can always point and say this one with beef! Haha


Def recommended."}
{"text":"We were in the neighbourhood with our 1 year old son and opted to check this place out. Definitely not stroller friendly, but we were able to fold it and put it off to the side. 

I opted for the enchiladas.. I forgot what my boyfriend ordered but he pointed to one of the photos on menu and got something totally different. 

The food was delicious, would return especially in the summer for a drink or two on the patio. Perhaps for date night :)

They recently added a small churro stand next door to what I believe used to be an ice cream stand. Fresh churros for $2 were great!"}
{"text":"It's not that i dont like mexican food, it's just that my bf likes it a little too much. Like a true californian, there's nothing more familiar to him than good mexican or tex-mex. Thus, when I come back to toronto without him, the last thing i am thinking about eating is mexican food. And yet, here we are, on a gorgeously sunny day, with some gorgeously looking girls, we sit out on a patio with glasses of mojitos on Unionville Main Street shoving dripping tortillas into our mouth. 

I had ordered the Sopes Mexicanos with Chorizo, which are mexican corn cakes topped with delicious refried beans, sour cream, pico de gallo, and who knows what crack. I also had some tacos from my friends and a chicken sope. I dont know how i have never had sopes before, but now i am hooked. Unfortunately, i'm not sure where in Europe i'm going to get to find these things but let me tell you, you really should stop by Planeta Mexico for them."}
{"text":"I would have given this review 4 stars but I had to struggle to give it a 3 and here's why: our dine-in experience was extremely uncomfortable. 

On regular jogs I'd run past this restaurant and always wish to go in sometime because of the enticing salsa music I can hear from the outside and the quaint-looking heritage building it occupies. But now that I've gone in and sat down, and experienced what \"heritage\" floorboards feel like and sound like without carpet, and how modern dining furniture accommodates the needs of a \"heritage\" sitting room's weird wall partitions and leveling, I think I'll stick to takeout the next time I visit Planeta Mexico.

The guacamole and tortilla chips were outstanding and flavourful. The smooth guacamole had a perfect amount of lemon juice, onion, and salt which I forever fail at getting right when making it at home. The chimichanga was delicious and I preferred it over the fried tacos (tip: if you order the guacamole, order a main that isn't fried so you won't feel so guilty about eating so many fried items in one meal). Sides of beans ad rice were delicious and fresh, and really gives you a sense of homecooked flavours.

Things they can improve in terms of atmosphere: throw a few rugs down so the floors stop vibrating and creaking whenever people walk on it.  Diners sitting in certain locations of this small and open space can feel EVERY SINGLE STEP.  

Customer service: You are a mom-and-pop restaurant and we sense it. But YouTube some basic service manners so patrons don't feel your hostility when they ask to switch tables due to too many floorboard vibes. And if you've decided to hire an employee solely for the purpose of refilling ice water, teach your employee to pour the water jug using the arm FURTHEST from the customer's face! It's a small thing, but sooo sooo important to get right to create a positive dining experience."}
{"text":"First time I came, I had the enchiladas and the guac - both amazing but the guac was fresh to death. I was so impressed with the quality for value of this place and had to bring my other girlfriends here.  

The second time I came, we ordered the taco burrito platter for two as well as the guac. The guac was made with bad avocados and you could tell because the taste was really off. I was extremely disappointed in the fish taco, which was really dry and bland. The buritto was the only saving grace because of the sour cream but it wasn't spectacular. The churro for dessert was the best part of the meal and we left very unsatisfied. Not sure what happened between my first and second visit because I raved about this place to my friends so I felt bad that it wasn't up to par that second visit."}
{"text":"Had a taco craving and decided to try this place out. we ordered a comb: $25 combo for 2, which came with one burrito and four tacos (and a lot of mexican sides). 
The fish tacos weren't bad, but the onions they served with it were super raw. I mean, FINE maybe they're SUPPOSED to be raw, but they were sliced so thickly that the onion taste just stayed in my mouth forever :( 
We also made the unfortunate decision of ordering fish with our burrito as well. The cheese and the fish kind of just melded together with the thick pita into one big sloppy mess. It's like everything else just got lost into it. 
The sides (beans, rice, pico, and salsa) were bland, again, onions that were too raw, and just didn't make things better.
Before all of this, the waiters gave an order to us that wasn't ours, and gave our order to somebody else... really not sure what happened there. It was pretty annoying - but maybe it's because we were just starving. 

The only thing that was kinda cool was the performer, because he kept serenading groups with his music and his humor - but otherwise, there's nothing that compels me to go back."}
{"text":"The restaurant is fine. It nice knowing there's a decent Mexican restaurant close to me. It's certainly not WOW factor, but it does somewhat satisfy the cravings for Mexican food.

The order consisted of a Nacho dish, Chicken Chimichanga, and Beef Enchiladas.

The best thing about the nachos were the chips. They were crispy, yet not extremely brittle. You can take a nice bite out of the chips without the whole chip breaking into pieces resulting in all of the toppings falling all over the place.

The Chicken Chimichanga and the Enchiladas had what seemed to be a traditional taste ( I can't exactly validate what \"traditional\" really means considering the last time I had Mexican food in Mexico. It was tasteless.)

Overall, I'd visit this restaurant again, but not on a regular. Perhaps I'm not a huge fan of Mexican cuisine?"}
{"text":"When this place first opened,  I fell in love very quickly.  I went a few times, than they started using chicken breast strips instead of pulled chicken for thier chicken dishes, totally ruined my local Mexican love. And they close very early."}
{"text":"Delicious Mexican place with good service.
We ordered 2 different quesadillas and a nacho to share. Obviously this was too much food for two people. Nachos were delish with home made tortilla chips. 
We also tried the churros which was just okay.
Will come back to try the burrito next time."}
{"text":"I visited Planeta Mexico this past Sunday when I had a craving for tacos or anything Mexican, and wanted to try something new. I ordered the Guacamole and chips to start, and had the Chimichanga with steak. The Guac was great, nice and creamy and more than enough freshly made tortilla chips to go around. The chimichanga was also fantastic and was a large portion! It was just crispy enough. Even the side of rice, pico de gallo and beans was great too.

My only complaints are that the service was a bit slow when we wanted to pay, and when I asked for a container to take home my leftovers they kept us waiting for a good 10 minutes then just kind of tossed it to us. My other gripe was that the seat/table we were placed at was literally in the corner of a wall, and I consider myself quite skinny and even I had trouble slipping into my seat and not bumping the table."}
{"text":"OK. Came for a meet up. I would have never come here otherwise. It would have been my loss entirely. 

It's located on main Street unionville. There's a lot of parking behind the building. Some on street but kinda hard to get.

The building is super cute on the outside and looks great on the inside. I love the decoration. Service was wonderful, everyone was so nice. This is a pretty popular place, it was a crappy traffic and parking week night (accident on Kennedy) night on the street and people came out. We were there a long time and the other tables were full almost all night.

The food. So good

We started with guacamole. It was delivered on avacado half shells. Served with homemade nachos. So delicious. I love guacamole and this was one of the best.

Tomato soup. Intense tomato taste, rice, spices, avacado. Loved it. Tasted like something my mom used to make.

Then we had Mimi chimichangus. So cute. They made them into little golden pouches of delicious. The looked as good as they tasted!

Flautas came next. Trays of rolled meat and cheese. Honestly by this point I would have left satisfied, having eaten some of the best Mexican food ever. But nope...

Fish tacos next. Home made tortillas, golden fried fish, crispy slaw. Yum. Stomach filled to 200%. Oh no....not....done...yet....

Finally we had dessert. Churros. Oh ... My... God.... No matter how much I say this was good, i can never describe how good they were. Warm from the fryer with a thick chocolate sauce. Words cannot describe.

So yeah. I loved this place. There's no way I'm not coming back. See you there!"}
