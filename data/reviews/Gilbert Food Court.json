{"text":"if you're looking for something different for a dining experience, this is it! Such a fun environment with live music. I brought my 3 year old son and he loved it too. The food was really good! Way better than I expected. Can't wait to come back :)"}
{"text":"Every time we go to have dinner in downtown area and we are told to WAIT we end up here!!! no wait here!! The trucks are good. Some nights there are more trucks than the other. You might have to stand and eat but that's no problem with me. It gets busy but not too bad. Some of the trucks have expensive seafood even. Take the kids and have a good time."}
{"text":"If the popular favorites of downtown Gilbert have a long wait time and you're hungry or just wanting to eat something new, the Gilbert food trucks is one to experience. The ever so popular Grilled Cheese food truck made its usual appearance offering one of their menu items : cheesy mac and rib. I was torn between this one and the  Sweet Siracha Chicken Melt. Ended up going for the American cuisine. Was cheesy good. I also tried Carh's Kitchen jalape√±o burger which I thought was mediocre but still decent. Temperature was h-o-t and icky. I would not recommend this for summer time unless the weather was 80 degrees or less. Otherwise it's fun to visit and eat. Maybe more tables would have been helpful and fans for the heat."}
{"text":"We tried the Heraldo's Mexican American food truck. It was terrible. The rice was salty the beans were overcooked and flavorless. The taquitos looked like they were purchased from Costco and reheated. They were burned on the bottom. The nachos were the worst I have every had. They were soggy, no cheese found anywhere and the chicken was salty. I do not recommend."}
{"text":"Food truck were decent.  There were 5 food trucks there tonight.  There was seating on plastic picnic tables."}
{"text":"This is so great! Catering food trucks meet here Friday nights and compete for business with awesome cooking. I am definitely a fan of a couple of the food trucks that make their way out here so I was so glad to see them as I was driving by. Grabbed a Mac n cheese grilled cheese sammich-YUM!!! From the grilled cheese truck......Catfish filet fish n chips from buzznbeez & a super rich cup cake for desert. SuperTruck Super Food was out there as well which I definitely enjoy eating so next time I'll refresh my taste buds with their savory menu!"}
{"text":"This has become a staple on Friday nights with my coworkers. I would say there are usually 5-8 different places to choose from on any given night. I've personally had Satay Hut, Liberty's Biscuits, Paletas Betty, Gigi's cupcakes, and the Gourmet Command Center but SuperFarm SuperTruck, The Chef Genie, The Grilled Cheese Truck, Sandra Dee's Catering and BuzznBee are usually there too. The trucks rotate so I suggest liking the Gilbert Food Truck Food Court on Facebook because they usually post the day before who is planning on being there this week. There are tables and benches but they tend to be full. I've seen people bring their own chairs and blankets to picnic on the grassy area near by during the cooler weather days. Now that it is summer and pretty hot, most trucks offer grab and go which is pretty nice of them and I really respect that there is an effort to continue the food court through the summer. Also, most trucks do take credit cards and there is usually live music too!"}
{"text":"I have only been once so I will definitely give it a try again, however when we went there was only five food trucks, one of which was ice cream. I had heard there were usually several more trucks than this, so we must have just come on a bad night. Anyway.... because there were only four food trucks to pick from I didn't feel the variety was good. Two of the food truck out of the four were quesadillas and stuff like that. There wasn't a grilled cheese truck (like I have heard a lot about) or BBQ or burgers. Nor was there anything kid friendly. The tables to sit at were gross.. they needed a good cleaning to be honest. There was a guy playing guitar as well.. he was awesome but the music was rather loud for such a small area.. it was very hard to socialize with our friends. The food we did get however was so awesome!!! We will go back again to see if there are more options, if it slim pickins the next time we won't be back."}
{"text":"Let me please confirm that Buzz'n Bee Soul food is soo Yummy! With soo much flavor and pride that goes into it, you can definitely tell she puts her all in her food. & I recommend you dive in and try it all!! :)"}
{"text":"Great variety of high quality food trucks! We brought 3 toddlers on a Friday night which ended up being a little difficult. Seating is limited and the area the trucks are in is very congested with all the food truck fans.  It's a unique thing to have such a great turn out of food trucks in one spot. Defiantly try this out if you want something new for your weekend night."}
{"text":"Super fun. Lots of good truck choices. Not too fond of the location or the seating options. Pretty small area for the amount of people that come out. Love the queso truck a aioli burger was packed (their burgers are so good). It's fun for a last min dinner decision."}
{"text":"WOW!  This place is happening!  We have been there several times and we have never been disappointed.  There have always been great choices of trucks...from lobster rolls to BBQ to hotdogs to farm burgers to waffles.  The food court is a great family event..just wish it was a little larger area."}
{"text":"Really fun event. Lots of different places since the trucks rotate weekly.  Had the worst poutine of my life tonight (fries with cheese curds and gravy for the uninitiated) from Coq-A-Doodle Do. 2 bites and threw it out. Fail."}
{"text":"This is a fun tradition if you are in the Gilbert area.  Several high end food trucks gather in downtown Gilbert every Friday night.  Normally there is a guy playing guitar (and he's really good) and 5-10 trucks offering a variety of choices.  The food is always excellent and the atmosphere is fun and lively."}
