{"text":"Delicious food and coffee. But the overwhelming apathy of the staff is off putting especially at their (high) price point. 25 mins for a breakfast sandwich and coffee with one other table in the store and five workers talking, snacking, joking amongst themselves. Fruit cup is only melon. Please, if you want to do that, just say melon on the menu, not fruit cup."}
{"text":"Food is consistently good, friendly service, but a bit on the pricey side."}
{"text":"I ate at Dean & Deluca this weekend for the first time and it was fabulous. I am obsessed!"}
{"text":"Oh Dean & Deluca!  What happened to you?  You USED to have the BEST cupcakes in the world -- the chocolate raspberry cupcakes were simply out of this world.  Today, I can't believe I paid $3.50 for a cupcake which is, quite possibly, worse than anything I've ever gotten in a grocery store or out of a box.  The cupcake was half the size, dry, and the frosting tasted as if it came straight from the can.  Only the price was the same.  Shame on you, D&D!  I expected better!"}
{"text":"Yeay! Who would not love Dean & Deluca?   This is a heavenly cafe. Coffee is delicious. Food is fresh and great! I think everything in this place is just amazing! I am going to give it 4/5 stars because its expensive. But hey! it may be well worth it! Just try the coffee once and you would love it!   Every time I am in Charlotte I stop by for coffee and occasional l will have lunch. Try their house salad with salmon! It is to die for! go all out and get an expensive drink like a perrier to go with it!"}
{"text":"I think I found another staple in Charlotte.  My first visit was an afternoon coffee to get a break from the office and stay awake the rest of the day.  My latte reminded me of the days I would take the same afternoon walk from the office to Eatzie's in Atlanta.  Very well done.  I also grabbed a rice krispie bar and a bag of chocolate covered caramels.  Impulse buy but I couldn't resist.  The fresh dessert selections were just too overwhelming to decide!  I was disappointed to find that my bag of caramels contained corn syrup but this one small offset wasn't enough to deter me from a second visit.  My husband walked over and met me after work a couple days later.  Just note, they close at 7:00 M-Th and 5:00 on Friday.  The selections are winding down for the day so if you want to get the full experience lunch time is the best time to go.  We ordered take away chicken quesadilla and chicken kabobs.  I honestly have not tasted a quesadilla done quite that way but it was a delightful new twist.  The chicken kabobs had a flavoring that reminded us of one of our favorite finds of at a restaurant in Waikkiki Beach, HI.  Yum!  We also made out with a $10 bottle of Malbec.  It is a small space but I'll definitely be back because there is still a great selection to choose from!"}
{"text":"Although I work in the same building as this restaurant, I rarely go because I hadn't found anything that knocked my socks off for the price I was paying.... Until today.  I had the Rotisserie Chicken salad on multigrain bread with tomato, spinach, and sprouts.  Delicious!!  The sandwich was $9 and worth every penny!  In addition, the portion was so large that I saved half for later --  that's even better.  I will be back for this sandwich.. over and over and over...."}
{"text":"I've worked downtown for over 13 years and have been to D&D over the years.  During my last visit a week ago, my food was calculated incorrectly.  No wonder because it was written on the box wrong.  So I questioned the total amount a bit too late and the transaction was already run.  Ok no problem.  Honest mistake.  The cashier looked annoyed and goes to get someone else to help.  Another associate approaches and says, \"Our prices have gone up.\"  I'm thinking, what?   Told her what I ordered and said that I'm just looking at the price written on the board.  And I said it very nicely because I didn't want to start any conflict.  *conflict avoider* Without a word, she then steps in to correct the transaction and walks away.  Ok no problem.  Everybody's busy.  Of course, no word from either the cashier or the helping associate, no accountability, no sorry, nothing.  Here I am apologizing for creating the problem by not catching the issue before the transaction was completed!  Just trying not to create a fuss.  And no one was rude, not at all, just ambivalent with the attitude that they couldn't care less.  Ok no problem.  I assumed, like a donkey that the error had been fixed and I went on my merry way.  So after all that, I find out last night after checking my credit card statement that instead of accurately crediting my account, the cashier ran the new transaction and the other associate credited the same amount, leaving me with what I started with...an overpriced lunch that wasn't worth it.  I won't be back!  Walk the extra block to Newk's!"}
{"text":"D&D you seem so nice, so friendly and clean... but also a little stuck up and pretentious. It's like if a banker and a lawyer got together and they designed a lunch place they would have designed you. Pricey is an understatement. I have enjoyed some great soups and salads from your kitchen but I just can't bare to spend more then $10 on a lunch where someone isn't coming to a table to serve me, or the food isn't giving me magical powers that will make me fly. Also, why is your coffee so weak? Maybe it's just me but it seems bland and flavorless like it's been watered down. I almost think that you are like the Gucci of cafe's in Charlotte. All the cool kids want to be seen in your cafe so that other people will know how important they are to Charlotte business. You do have good food and great service so you get 3 stars from me."}
{"text":"Paying more for the name than for what basically amounted to cafeteria line food.   Went there on lunch break, and ordered a cup of soup and grabbed a pre-packaged bag of sweet potato chips.   I went up to the counter expecting to pay around $5 or so, with tax, and was very surprised when the girl behind the counter said the total was for $8.50   I can only assume that the additionaly $3 was the surcharge for the privlidge to be allowed into the shop in the first place.   Not sure, but based on what I got, I was not too impressed."}
{"text":"Solid lunch spot. Always enjoy my sandwich. Friendly people. They keep it too cold inside though."}
{"text":"Their turkey and avocado sandwich is to die for.  Haven't had any of their other stuff, since I'm all about loyalty :)  They serve great quality meats and veggies.  Not to mention the espresso and coffee here is excellent.  It's a great place for people that work nearby Uptown to stop by for lunch.  The line is never too ridiculously long and there is usually somewhere to sit.  The only downside - it's a very expensive sandwich."}
{"text":"Dean & Deluca is a fantastic option for a quick after work treat   Looking for a light meal for dinner - but ended up being not such a light meal   Pimento Cheese Sandwich on Cracked Black Pepper Bread .... delish pimento cheese mix & the bread was thickly sliced, soft w/ huge crackles of black pepper.....gave it a nice little kick   Also tried a side salad of Chickpeas, Feta, Olives, sundried tomato - it was good but a bit too oily for me   ANNNNND - couldn't pass up the Homemade Spicy Potato Chips - crunchy & huge & not really hot spicy but flavorful spicy & would get them again   Way too full to splurge on dessert - but next time, my pretty!"}
{"text":"I'm a D&D fan, it's always a sure thing.  But after opening the bottle of wine I'd purchased to accompany my dinner, I was heartbroken to discover what appeared to be a leaky cork and a bottle that had gone bad.  I know this isn't the best place for wine, but I think I could have gotten better cared for wine at a gas station.  And my fellow winos out there can relate to the feeling of anticipation of that first sip after a long day, only to be met with bitter disappointment.  Also, a bit disappointed in the selection of grocery items.  I realize it's just a cafe, but the acres of shelf space dedicated to repetitive merchandising of candy could be used for more variety.  Caprese salad could have used much more basil as well.  I'll stick with my usual D&D from now on."}
{"text":"Had the pesto chicken salad sandwich... mediocre. Didn't really taste the basil, pine nuts, Parmesan... Really any of the components of pesto. My mother in law had some minestrone soup which she enjoyed though, not too salty (which a lot of places have a hard time doing!) so that bumps them up from a meh to an ok. I'd return, to try something completely different."}
{"text":"OK MOCHA. Got a mocha latte. It's was ok, a little too mocha-ie. The service was great, the place was nice but the coffee was ok. It was sting espresso, and made manually;grind, tap, pump, serve. Good coffee but the mocha part of it wasn't."}
{"text":"I an rating this 4 stars because the turkey and brie sandwich was one of the best I've ever had. The cannoli, however, was borderline terrible."}
{"text":"I walked in and ordered the breakfast sandwich. They rang me up and I sat down to wait. 10+ minutes later I went up to the counter to ask about the sandwich and they said it was impossible that I ordered it because breakfast was closed.  So, another 5+ minutes of trying to convince them that I did in fact pay for a sandwich they relented and said they would refund my money.  Of course it took another 5+ minutes and a handful of employees to figure out how to make a refund."}
{"text":"Dean & Deluca is a solid lunch staple in Uptown - great for lunch or for a quick treat! Although it's on the pricier side, they have many options, from pre-made deli type items (meat balls, prepared salads, etc) as well as sandwiches, soups, and salads. Good drink and side selections, and an excellent bakery that I may or may not indulge in more often than I should ;)   To give you an idea of what \"pricey\" means to me, my usual lunch comes to around $17-$20 (eek, I know!): Small house salad with chicken, fruit cup, and coconut water.   Note that it does get pretty packed during lunch and the lines tend to slow down, however I don't usually mind because grabbing lunch is one of the few breaks in my day."}
{"text":"Since I'm here for two weeks, I have to say I'll be venturing in more than once.  Everything I ate here (turkey sandwich, cookie and coffee) was incredibly fresh.  The ingredients were very good and the meat was not processed.  I definitely enjoyed every aspect of my lunch.  If you're downtown, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I miss working across the street from this D&D.  It was so convenient to just walk across the street in the morning / afternoon / evening & grab one of their sirloin sandwiches, tasty make your own salad or their delicious soup offerings.    While this location is small, they are quick & get you in & out.  They do offer treats (like Nicole stated), coffee & quick bites if you're really in a hurry.  Everything is really fresh & I love the \"deli type\" feel of the sandwiches wrapped in white paper & salads in the white boxes."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent and I really enjoy the upscale selection of basically everything--from salads to sandwiches to drinks to desserts--the only thing that's holding back my review is that it took me forever to get my lunch. The staff were friendly, just everything moved a little slow for me. It was worth it in the end based on quality, so I still recommend going."}
{"text":"Cappuccino was perfect!!! Great variety of pastry to compliment. I wish I found this place sooner. I went back and ordered breakfast sandwich and cheese danish. The Cappo was made by someone different and it wasnt perfect but still beats Starbucks. The cheese danish was creamy...mmmmm. The sandwich was toasted and the cheese was melted. I wish we had these in Cali."}
{"text":"Shocked to find a Dean & Deluca in of all places Charlotte, NC.  Has the usual assortment of sandwiches, salads and gourmet coffees.  A little light on the assortment of interesting snacks, but in a city where most things are battered and slathered, a welcome change.  It gets busy at lunch time so try to be there before noon."}
{"text":"I ordered the D&D club sandwich. It was extremely filling. I only ate half and that was almost too much. The bread was soft, the meat was plentiful and the additional toppings were fresh !"}
{"text":"A very good but somewhat pricey cafe offering outstanding coffee, tea, hot cocoa and sandwiches. This Uptown location is somewhat small, but it is right across the street where I work. So its quite convenient for me.  I typically go for their breakfasts, where they have outstanding omelets, breakfast burritos and sandwiches on a croissant bun. Yum! I just love their coffee. This is a good alternative for those who just don't want to wait in those hour long Starbucks lines.   If you go here just after they open at 7am, there is rarely a line because the Bankers are all still sleeping while us hard working non-banker types are off and running!"}
{"text":"I don't understand everyone's infatuation with Dean and Delucas. I've been to the ones in New York and they were great. Lots of selection, but they are HUGE! Obviously, this location is  alot smaller (just a deli and small bakery area). There is nothing here that I find 'awesome', just mediocre. They do have some pretty good soups though, however I think they are overpriced.  I got a chicken cobb salad the other day at it was $12.50! It was good, but nothing that Newks or Panera couldn't make. I would never have the urge to go back and order it. Long story short, I really only try to go to Deans because of the location (across from my office), but there are plenty of other options for me to pick from in Uptown.  Not a fan."}
{"text":"Excellent latte and breakfast burrito.  My wife enjoyed her make your own omelet.  We would definitely be back here for breakfast."}
{"text":"Just a little deli/cafe. You can get your delish D&D food and eat it inside or to go. I just wish it were an entire grocery store and not just a little cafe."}
{"text":"This may not be as expansive as the flagship D&D in SoHo, but the ambiance is just as spectacular.   While listening to the ever elegant classical soundtrack D&D plays, I enjoyed a small custom salad coupled with a decadent prosciutto sandwich. The mixed greens used in the salad were crisp and vivacious, the prosciutto thinly sliced- just as it should be-and thoughtfully draped over disks of fresh mozzarella, a true sensory overload. After your lunch at D&D, you'll feel fully rejuvenated, as if you had spent a day at the spa.   As for the service, every chef I spoke with was nothing short of amicable and disposed to offer a menu selection. They were well versed on the myriad of products offered and even followed up after my lunch on how I enjoyed the new San Pellegrino flavor That I tried for the first time.   Anyone who is in search of a new daily lunch spot, this is without a doubt the place to be."}
{"text":"Excellent quality and food but the cashiers are always unfriendly and distracted. I still recommend the place."}
{"text":"Happy to find Dean and DeLuca for some tea and cookies.  Great to see babka in Charlotte!  The cookies here were soft, just how I like them.  The baked goods were fresh."}
{"text":"The turkey delight is great! Prices are affordable and I would definitely recommend this place for breakfast or a snack. The staff was awesome and so friendly (I'm not a morning person and I went for breakfast so I really needed that kind of service to get my day going). It is pretty cramped and the food/beverage ordering is a little more complicated than necessary, but not so bad that it would keep me from going again. I will be back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Excellent soy lattes, omlettes and salads. The salads are super fresh and the salmon is excellent. You can customize your salad any way you like and the portions are huge. There is no need to get anything bigger than a small salad because that in itself is humongous. I usually walk out with a $11 salad and it is enough to keep me full the entire day until 8pm at night. I always get the salmon and avocado additions since they are super fresh. Omlettes are pretty good and they make it very quickly for you. Hands down some of the best latte I have had in Charlotte, lattes from the chain coffeeshops cannot compare to this. Also grab one of the dry cranberry snacks on your way to the cash register, they are super delicious and excellent for a midday snack. This is my go to spot for breakfast and lunch during my stay in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Great coffee and lunch spot central to the offices in Uptown.  Coffee and drink options galore. Prepared breakfast yogurts and fruit cups for on-the-go. Fresh heaping salads made to order. Delicious gourmet sandwiches made to order. Hot soup options for lunch combos. Obscenely decadent desserts made fresh morning.  Variety of pre-packed snacks for the afternoon munchies.  They've got it all in this little market cafe. Fast and friendly service with only 1 or 2 people in line most times. Seating options inside and out. Prices are on the moderate to expensive side."}
{"text":"PROS- turkey avocado (I had it put on sourdough instead of wheat) 5 stars             - cobb salad (was ok. I'd give a different one a try since the ingredients did   seem fresh. 3stars)             - pasta salad - with feta, sundried tomatoes, DELICIOUS. 5stars  So I signed up for Yelp today, b/c I'm in Charlotte shooting for a television show and have been traveling around Uptown, trying all of the restaurants, etc, for the last 3 weeks.  I use yelp, A LOT to decide on where I'm going to spend my $$ and what establishments I trust with my stomach. :)   today was my day to try Dean & Deluca uptown market cafe.  I woke up, not wanting anything heavy, fried etc.  And with it being my day off from shooting, decided to throw my work out clothes on over my baby bump (I'm shooting & pregnant..yay! fun lol) and head up the street from my hotel to the market cafe.   Being the type of eater I am, I was thoroughly excited to walk in and see the food options.  Salads.  Fresh toppings.  Sandwiches and yummy homemade pasta salads, etc.    while I let the woman in line behind me order first, since I hadn't decided, I walked over to the desert bar and took a peak.  And while perusing the casing, I notice a pair of eyes, shooting me a dirty look through the glass.  It was the female cashier.  A short, young female.  I smiled.  She scowled.  Okaaayyyyyy.  No desert for me.  Moving on.    I ordered my food.  The young guy working was nice enough.  Not much personality.  And I'm a pretty nice, friendly, conversational person, that used to work in 'customer service' jobs, so when ppl aren't really receptive to a customer's kindness, it puts me a bit 'off.'  But he was sweet, just a bit reserved which was fine.  I didn't come in to buy a friend, I came for the food.    When I went to the register to pay, I noticed the 6-8 ppl at the tables inside didn't have much 'energy' about them either.  It actually seemed kind of 'stuffy' and 'stuck up' and I live in LA.  So for me to say that, is saying A LOTTTTTT.  It was sort of funny, but odd at the same time.    A gentlemen, black, who may or may not have been homeless, but definitely had fallen on hard times, was at the register with one of their 'free refill' cups and asked for some ice.  The cashier girl would have killed him with dirty looks if she could.  As if ice were gold and he a mere peasant.  The guy wasn't out of control, he just wanted some ice.   Her demeanor to me, was gross and really uncalled for seeing as though she's a CASHIER WORKER at a cafe.  Like, if Princess Di could be nice to less fortunate ppl around the world....and you can't???? Ummm...ok.  The cashier girl rang me up.  ZERO personality.  ZERO smile.  ZERO kindness.   Again, it was funny to me b/c I always speak, and smile and generally enjoy ppl interaction even if brief.  I plan on going back tomorrow.  Not b/c of the service, bc I would give that a 1 and the food a 4. So I settled at a 3."}
{"text":"I love coming to D&D for lunch!  What I love about this place is the consistency.  YES it is pricey but I am a big fan of price/value balance.  I usually get the Small Asian Salad with chicken (and extra crunchies) and it is $9.99 without tax.  Expensive yes, but this IS worth it!  I walk out and I know I have a ten dollar salad but it is worth every penny.  It is huge and is always fresh.  The greens are never nasty which can sometimes happen at Just Fresh.  The chicken is marinated and never gross.  It comes with mandarin oranges too.  I eat every last bite and it is so delicious.    The soups are fantastic if you dont think you are going to work late and therefore do not need much of a lunch.  Fiesta Chicken is a huge favorite!!  It has a little kick to it so if you are tired of sitting in the office being refrigerated all day, get this soup and you will thaw right out!  Love you D&D!"}
{"text":"On my second day working in Charlotte, I was much better prepared.   I'd scoped out the local shops and restaurants and decided to get myself a sandwich for lunch at Dean & Deluca.  While I've never actually been to the original Dean & Deluca in New York City, I've been to their Napa Valley location several times and it is quite and impressive store:  a colorful aisle with fresh vegetables and fruits, an aromatic display of various cheeses, and a beautiful display of breads and pastries it makes my mouth water just thinking about it.  This Charlotte location is tiny in comparison, but they made me a beautiful Italian sandwich to go and, while it was somewhat pricey at $9, the sandwich was ample enough to allow me to eat only half and save the rest for the next day.    The bread was nice and fresh and the tomato, mozzarella and charcuterie on the sandwich made for a beautiful lunch.    I would highly recommend you try their sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  They have large salads for a good price.  Love the coffee, always have fresh fruits and berries.  The bagel and cream cheese is also delicious.  If you want something healthier the omelets are also delicious. Probably my favorite casual place to eat in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Interesting that I've actually never really seen a Dean & Deluca out on the streets except when watching Felicity in the day. But I digress. Pretty good coffee and my colleagues seemed pretty stoked about their sandwiches."}
{"text":"Got dropped off in DT Charlotte for an entire day and happened upon Dean & Deluca.  I'm rating this PURELY on the coffee that I got here and the venue. It was just okay, but not nearly as comfortable as the Starbucks down the street.  I like to find a nice cafe to do the morning crossword and this cafe is part of a mall-like structure. This place seems to be POPPIN' for lunch and sandwiches, but I found it to be on the expensive side since I like to \"eat on the cheap\" when I'm in NC. Seems like a pretty good place for corporate lunch orders to go though!!  The cafe itself is not small, it has a good amount of space, but only a fraction of the space is reserved for customer seating. The seats aren't the most comfortable so it's not a place I'd would linger for more than an hour or two. Plenty of seating in the outside corridor of the mall and a public restroom in the building (up the escalators and to the left).   If you're looking for free wifi and more seating, I'd go for the starbucks a 3 minute walk away!! :)"}
{"text":"How clever, putting a NEW YORK DELI in the heart of Charlotte's Uptown! Now we can finally emulate the lifestyle of Wallstreet bankers at the lunchtime hour! I certainly feel an air  of confidence and BALLERness when I purchase a $10 sandwich and I'm not even being saracastic!   These ingredients are the freshest of the fresh. The avocado? Real. Cajun Chicken? Fsho. Caramelized Onions? So Sweet. It's one of those delis that exudes sophistication in tantalizing the tastebuds and alludes to the core values of homemade Italian cuisine (clear distinction from Italian restaurant food).   Gourmet pastas, tomato sauces, and snacks line the metal racks, tempting consumers to impulsively dish out an extra twenty. Freshly made potato salad, couscous, and tomato pesto penne await you behind the curved glass showcase. There's no doubt something for everyone here.  My preference? The Roast Beef sandwich... toasted of course! And we're not talking just ANY dry, miserable, cow sandwich. This could quite possibly be the greatest roast beef sandwich that I've ever tasted! The flavor possesses many levels of which I will now describe for your reading pleasure:  Your first bite begins with the toasted crunch of the two thin layers of bread, which then gives way to the horseradish radish spread that blends well with the melted havarti cheese. Quickly following, is a second level of \"crunch\" yielded  by the fresh piece of lettuce and tomato, which then make way for an explosion of sweet caramlized onion. All this then somehow infuses the tender pieces of roast beef lying in the middle, allowing you to finish the bite off with conviction. Yea, that just happened.  It's hard to imagine this place is a chain, but for what its worth, it certainly stands out from its competition. A bit pricey? possibly. We're in Charlotte after all.  4/5"}
{"text":"Very fresh salads here! I'm a big fan of lunch spots that offer a healthy yet filling selection of choice lunches for those trying to be health conscious.  D&D sets the bar in that regard.  Love the deli sandwich selections but especially like the salads.  My last visit I got the baby spinach salad and it was light, fresh, and ordained with bacon and still came in at a whopping 500 calories :).    This particular location gets crowded during lunch but they do a good job of getting you in and out if you're in a hurry.  But if you aren't in a rush, grab a window seat or a seat outside (weather permitting) and enjoy the people watching."}
{"text":"This place is OVERPRICED with average desserts.  A mini cheesecake and a can of san pellegrino for 10 dollars? really? The cheesecake was nothing special, but done properly.  I also saw regular sized macarons sold for $4/each.That's MORE EXPENSIVE THAN LA DUREE in manhattan. Go figure.  I definitely would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I hit this spot up whenever I was uptown for work and wanted a fancy eatery to enjoy a slow breakfast with a prime location to watch passerby on a busy work morning.  I've fallen in love with their amazingly seasoned home fries (yes, a must-try!!!!) and their bacon and eggs are always perfectly cooked.  It's a bit on the pricey side, but for this spot, it's people watching perfection!!!!  I feel like if you have a few extra minutes and you can enjoy a little bit longer breakfast, treat yourself!!!!"}
{"text":"2 words.........consistent pricey *grin*.  But good service...even when it is slammed during lunch (hint: if you are visiting town during the week...go early or later when it comes to lunch...or expect to deal with lines here."}
{"text":"I have purchased food form this store and the Rea Road store. They have decent breakfast which is why I have  given  them two stars. But the sandwiches which average $10 a piece, are totally sub par and overpriced. I honestly think you can get better quality for less money at some of the chain sandwich shops. Their pastries are so so; Amelie's does a much better job than they do for about the same price. Overall I feel this chain markets itself as  a high end  gourmet food store and charges a lot but it doesn't deliver on food quality."}
{"text":"I got the Portobello Panini (Portobello mushrooms, red peppers, mozzarella, basil mayonnaise) as a late lunch one weekday afternoon. The sandwich was ok but nothing special. For $10, it wasn't a satisfying meal. I was also disappointed by the peanut butter M&A bar that I got as a dessert. It looked delicious, but had very little taste. Probably won't be returning here. It wasn't awful, but there must be better places for lunch in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I see a lot of reviews on here with low ratings. The majority of those people are not the clientele nor the individuals who even get the concept of fresh, grab&go gourmet food in my opinion. This location has always had super friendly and willing staff. My family and I have frequented this location for over 8 years and it's stayed consistent in its offerings and I am truly sorry to hear that it is closing it's doors. It is not closed yet- so go and enjoy at least once before it does!   PRO's  * perfect for gourmet gifts for coworkers and family * perfect lunch time spot conveniently located on Tryon Street * awesome selection of coffees and espresso beverages * awesome ready made meal options to pick-up after work & a wine selection to choose from as well * amazing fresh salads made to order with tons of options- all served up in a paper takeaway box  CON's  * no Sunday brunch (missed opportunity) * no significant advertising with the numerous Fortune 500 companies that surround it * more brand awareness for the thousands of new residents living in the new towers around corner * space was challenging- an update in the last decade would have been wonderful * not enough inviting space to sit and really take advantage of all the offerings    *The take-away for anyone reading this: AWESOME COMPANY! The power of the simple white paper bag and black lettering supersedes the multitude of Starbucks and other food & coffee retailers. Sure, some opportunity was lost over the years but the power of the little white bag (as silly as it may sound) could easily rally a come back in the right space.   ^Loyalty Apps/cards which sought data for sign-up would have truly tracked your customer base and their desires for more.   FACTS:   Comparing pricing for items at comparable establishments like; Bar CoCo by The Ritz Carlton, CoCo & The Director, Stoke, Corked,  and Amelie's French Bakery the pricing was maybe 5-10% more or equal."}
{"text":"Dean and Deluca... I was expecting more of a grocery and kitchen supplies shop? Y'know, based on their reputation and website?   Regardless, this prim & proper cafe serves up some very nice lunch fare. As others have mentioned, you simply *must* try the turkey and brie sandwich. The salads are also very good - you don't expect it because there's nothing unique or gourmet-sounding about any of them - but the quality of the ingredients is what matters here. On your way to the register, you can buy the *most expensive French macaron in town*. $2.49 is hella pricey, weighing in at $0.50 more per cookie than Bottega Louie's famous macarons in L.A. Is it worth it? Actually, yeah, kinda! Huge variety that rotates daily and they are HUGE compared to a place like Amelie's. Also, unlike Amelie's, THEY DON'T LEAVE THEIR MACARONS IN THE FUCKING REFRIGERATOR ALL DAY, MAKING THEM HARD AND CRUNCHY. I mean, sweet Jebus, where did Amelie's learn how to store a proper macaron?! Okay, rant over.  The prices did not bother me so much. Maybe that's cuz I'm used to paying $10 - $14 for a good sandwich. So, whatevs."}
{"text":"The sandwiches and salads here are great. I usually come to pick up some sushi if I need a quick lunch and am craving raw fish. The location is kind if small and has limited seating which is fine if you are planning on just bringing something back to your desk"}
{"text":"Update !!  Went here for lunch, wow it was great.  The chef had her favorite sandwich on special, a classic Cuban.  Cuban and a Pepsi made a perfect lunch.  I was able to get through the checkline faster by using the outer register - I am not sure they expect people to queue up at the first one."}
{"text":"Absolutely feeling discriminated against...while ordering breakfast, I was told they can't bring my breakfast to me at my table yet I watched 2 other patrons (not of the same ethnicity) have their breakfast brought to their table.  Not cool D&D.  I'm an avid customer who went out of his way to find this place only to have a shitty start to his day. Don't plan on ever coming back to a D&D.  Peace!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches that appeal to the type of people who live/work in uptown Charlotte. The largest drawback of this place (obviously) is the PRICE. Come here once, steal some ideas, then make it back at your house for a fraction of the price. It'd be different if the atmosphere was inviting, warm, and homey but ... it's not. Stifled cafe to boot.  Turkey & brie sandwich is to die for."}
{"text":"I adore this place. It is a wonderful one stop shop for all you may need during a work day. Coffee is all really good, food is wonderful, and they even have some great selections of wine! Their salads are massive and so good! They also have cold salads and a small cooler with sushi!   A great one stop shop that's convenient to a lot of businesses in uptown!"}
{"text":"I like this D&D...I don't *love* it. I think I feel this way because it's a limited menu, small space and less inviting than the other D&D's in SouthPark and so on.   The treats, snacks and drinks are still decent - especially the lemon bars that I can manhandle in minutes. Do yourself a favor and get one. Additionally, I've had pretty decent luck parking in the metered space out front...granted that's been at odd times during the day!   For a quick chai latte, a salad to go or snagging a treat for your boss this Dean & Deluca suits just fine Uptown."}
{"text":"Dean's and DeLuca's lunch options are pretty solid but their breakfast game is one of the best in Charlotte. Really, really good breakfast burrito."}
{"text":"Came to Dean & De Luca in the am to grab a quick cup of tea and a bagel. The uptown location on Tryon is nice inside, well kept with some tables for you to sit down at and great looking treats on display for you to salivate over.   The service here was pretty good, I missed the morning rush so I got through the line quickly. I was looking forward to trying a bagel, since I am on my quest for a good bagel down here, but I was so disappointed to find out that they stop serving bagels at 10 am!!! I thought that was a bit extreme, but I guess they just cater to the early morning communters. Overall, a pretty good experience here."}
{"text":"It doesn't wow me.  When I go somewhere fancy shmancy like D&D, I want to be wowed.  Sure, they have pretty good food (made to order salads are very tasty, and the sweet treats are definitely yummy), but it's a cramped space, the people behind the counter are not that friendly (I get the sense that they just want you to come in, order something and leave so that they can get back to what they were doing before you walked in), and a bit pricey... so maybe that's what it's like to live in New York?  (JK, NY peeps, I'm sure you're awesome).  I've never tried their sandwiches before, but I've heard they're pretty great.  As for the salad, if you're tired of every other place to get a salad in uptown, D&D is good to hit up for some toppings you won't find elsewhere (think goat cheese, roasted red peppers, nuts), but the experience was just not wow-tastic for me.  Not that I wouldn't come back for a cannoli, because they have them there.  Not the best I've had, but certainly not the worst!"}
{"text":"Think of Starbucks with minimalist modern decor and wide variety of prepared foods at the counter. Chai latte could have been stronger and hotter. Fruit salad was generic."}
{"text":"Little pricey for a coffee, but it was good! Staff here was really friendly. And I enjoyed the ambiance of the store. It seemed like a good place to grab lunch from the deli or a treat form the bakery , but I just stuck to an iced white chocolate latte.   But again, overpriced."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast or lunch spot during the work week. The staff is so friendly and recognize their patrons. The food is never disappointing and the salads are always fresh. I also have never been somewhere that had consistently perfect avocados. I will definitely been getting soup and salad from here today at lunch and just finished my breakfast. This place is phenomenal."}
{"text":"I've always liked Dean and Deluca with their selection of more upscale sandwiches and salads.  Though it's a bit pricey it is good. (Is it worth the price? Well, I guess it depends.)  I became familiar with Dean and Deluca after living in New York, so I was pleased to see one in Charlotte.  I came here one day for lunch and loved the selection! I've heard amazing things about the turkey avocado sandwich, but I opted for the portobello, asparagus, sun dried tomato and mozzarella sandwich. The sandwich was simple and good, but I didn't like the bread it was on - maybe it would've been better toasted or on sourdough.  I also had the chickpea salad which was I did enjoy.  This is a good place for lunch and you can expect more than your average deli."}
{"text":"Stopped in on our way out of Charlotte and got coffee and a few sandwiches for our train ride home.  The caramel latte is exactly what I needed, so YUM!!!  We got a roast beef sandwich and a turkey/brie sandwich.  While the sandwiches were good, I do think they are over priced.  Then again it is midtown so I didn't expect cheap...  We also got some of the candy lego blocks for our son, which he had a ball with (I know I can get these other places but because there was something there for him, made me happy).  We will be returning!"}
{"text":"This is an awesome uptown lunch location. Dean and Deluca, while small in size, has a vast selection of options if you're looking for salads, sandwiches, or pasta. The staff is friendly and one fella, Dior, is the best chef this side of the Mississippi. The staff actually seems like they enjoy their job, which manifest itself in the form of good customer service. There isn't a high turnover rate, an indication of good management. The food here is always fresh and priced decently if you know what to order. A whole sandwich is enough for two people and a half sandwich is more like 3/4 and around $6. The desserts, while tasty, are grossly overpriced. Skip out on them, despite the enticing presentation by the counter. If you're here in the morning, I recommend the custom made omelette. Side note: The lines here are often long, but move quickly. Do everyone a favor and know what you want by the time it's your turn to place your order."}
{"text":"Overrated and too expensive.. will take the other over them. I ordered white hot chocolate mocha and received 2 drinks, white mocha and hot chocolate and they were not hot.....All Interesting not sure I will return."}
{"text":"They either don't have or refuse to cut up lemons for the iced tea. Other than that, its a good place to hang out and people watch if you need to kill time uptown."}
{"text":"Can watch your food being made, line moves very quickly for the rushed lunch crowd. Great spot for lunch uptown!"}
{"text":"Since my review in April of last year I have become a fan of the Dean & Deluca's lunch options and definitely get here once a week.  Although this location is small, the servers have a rythem and things seem to move quickly.  Although I typically choose a sandwhich, of which I have tried a few, the turkey and avacado, caprese and the french dip special, I have also enjoyed some of their soups. Among my favorite, the lobster bisque, a warm and think lobster creme base that is just perfect on a chilly day.  Overall, Dean & Deluca offers a variety of options for all, as well as some amazing speciality items that you don't find available in other lunch venues in uptown.  I definitely look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Asian salad was shitty at best.  The cucumbers looked like they were frozen along the way and the mandarin orange sections were total mush. Couldn't even eat this and I eat nearly everything.  Tomato basil soup was fine."}
{"text":"My #1 go-to lunch spot uptown.  It's actually kind of embarrassing how many D&D bags I have stashed at my desk.  I get the Cobb Salad and substitute Parmesan & Ranch for Blue Cheese.  The small is more than enough to fill me up, and comes in at less than $10, which, quite frankly, is a bargain, made doubly delicious by the quality of the ingredients (they literally peel & slice the avocado in front of you).  This store is the smaller 'outlet' cafe version, if you're looking for the larger market try Phillips Place (which also has a pretty suave wine bar)."}
{"text":"It was ok.  Not bad, but not great, especially for the price.  The food was good, and the place is very clean and tidy, but a bit in a sterile sort of way.  I suppose it'd be a good place to eat lunch during work, as a tourist I'd check out other more local places, however (which we did)."}
{"text":"The service behind the salad counter could be a bit more friendly.. we came in around 1:30 on a weekday, after the lunch rush, so perhaps she was just tired after dealing with a crowd?  The Greek salad with feta vinaigrette (added chicken) was very tasty! And their sweets and treats counter is always tempting."}
{"text":"Stepping in here is reminiscent of like a Crate and Barrel (Crate not Cracker) or something. It seems like everyone carries the essence of an executive chef. The staff is incredibly friendly and quality products accompany that friendliness. I feel fancy coming here.  If D&D focused strictly on coffee, they'd put Starbucks to shame. Alas, they do not and for that I thank them. The food is really good and so is the coffee.   Stop by and do not pass up the chicken and dumplin' soup."}
{"text":"Loved the clean feel and open space. I came for coffee and some friends got more custom coffees and breakfast food. I found the service to be ok, but they were either understaffed or not communicating well. My iced coffee wasn't made and I had to ask after the sandwiches were made for it to be made. Breakfast sandwich options aren't easily visible/seen on the menu. The sandwiches were all very greasy, too. The center area with gifts and coffee was really cute... a little on the higher end of price for the items, though. The high point is the pastry window. The macaroons are gluten free and got high marks. Might be better with a little work on the service and delivery. Oh, and they're closed Sundays."}
{"text":"Being stuck in Charlotte a week at a time, this is the only place I go to for breakfast and lunch EVERY Day. It is just that good. Not too be missed. A winner and keeps a smile on my face and belly every day. Straight 5-star!!!"}
