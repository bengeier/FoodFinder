{"text":"I ordered a chicken parmesan hoagie. I think they forgot my order because the guy asked me twice what my order number was (it was 18). As I waited, other people with order numbers higher than mine got their food. After about a 35 minute wait, I was about to walk out when the hoagie came. It was basically a few chicken chunks surrounded in sauce with some melted cheese. on a toasted bun Not great, not bad, but I've had far better. The menu is kind of expensive. The saving grace is that this is an addition to the places you can eat uptown during lunch--there's not that many. To be fair, they just opened so I am interested if they can work out the kinks. Their menu is probably too large for them to do any one thing well. I am not sure the owners have any food service experience--the employees were very slow and showed no \"hustle.\""}
{"text":"Stopped in here before an event at PPG Paints. Every other surrounding place was super crowded so we decided to stop here. The white pizza was phenomenal. Jalape単o poppers were excellent as well. The raviolis were a little over cooked and that would be my only complaint. However, that would not deter me from coming here again and I certainly be back. Friendly staff and service. I also liked the atmosphere. Service was good considering how busy it was and the staff was very friendly. I recommend checking out this place if you haven't already."}
{"text":"Unfriendly staff and the hoagie had hardly any meat on it. Save ur $$$ and go elsewhere. They will be out of business in 6 months"}
{"text":"Stopped here the day after they opened. Got a large take-out pizza, half cheese half pepperoni (gotta start with the basics) and waited about 25 min. I'm sure wait time is going to be a big longer since they just opened and are getting a system down. Everyone works out kinks when they just get started.  It's location is definitely convenient being just a block from PPG Paints Arena on Fifth Ave. I can see it doing well before and after Pens games and events. It's also nice to have a pizza place for lunch up this way toward Uptown and not having to walk to Market Square all the time. Can't wait to try more from the menu!"}
{"text":"Pizza was amazing. Not busy at all. Great service  Chicago deep dish was one of the best things"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite before a concert. Glad we did. Quiet place amidst all the noisy and packed bars nearby. Had a delicious slice which was just enough to tide us over. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Great! I know they just opened, I thought my hoagie was very good. I am very picky and this is deff a place I will go back to. The staff was friendly to us and helpful when questions where asked."}
{"text":"Food was good, service not so much. The main problem is that orders were brought out piecemeal. My sandwich and fries came, while my friend waited another 15 minutes for his sandwich, and his fries never arrived. We even asked about the fries when his sandwich came out, and were assured they were on the way. I ended up asking for a refund on the missing fries, since we needed to head to a Pens game. I noticed the same sort of thing happening with other tables, food coming out one entree at a time with lots of space in between.  Could have just been the day we were there, but the restaurant was also unbearably hot. It was 70 degrees outside, so maybe they didn't have the air on. At any rate, too hot to enjoy food in."}
{"text":"I ordered my third grilled buffalo chicken salad from here today. The first two visits I had no issues other than the food not being prepared in the time frame they gave me. Everything was tasty and well prepared. Being a new lunch spot downtown I can deal with that.   Today however they gave me the fried chicken instead I'd the grilled chicken I had ordered.  Their fried chicken was not good at all. It tasted like it sat out to long after cooked. Their was also a hair in my salad that I subsequently had to fish out of my mouth.   I asked for them to add jalape単os to my salad at my request. I was a little surprised that they charged $1 for them. I have no problem paying for my jalape単os but I can buy an entire jar of them for $1.27 at Aldi. Just noticed that was a little much for the 7 jalape単os they put in my salad."}
{"text":"The food is always made fresh and comes out piping hot. I got one of the wedgies and it was huge. Parking sucks in the area sometimes, but you can tell that the owners put a ton of work into decorating the interior. There's plenty of seating and there's two floors."}
{"text":"This place has no idea how to serve food. They got my wings out 10 minutes before my fiances calzone, said that's normal when we asked about it, and then almost gave his food away to someone else. Don't expect good serive and pay attention to when they call out your order or you'll never get it. My garlic wings were pretty disappointing too. The \"sauce\" was basically watery butter with a tint bit of minced garlic. Oh, and they were all drums! I didn't get a single flat which is super disappointing."}
{"text":"Great pizza and salads. Salads are always fresh and very full. The ranch dressing is fabulous and I suggest getting a cup with your pizza! If you get it by the slice be ready for a huge piece!! The service is great and they are always willing to fix something if it came out wrong. Great place to have a quick lunch!"}
{"text":"A great pizza shop for eat in or carry-out! Great place to visit prior to the penguins games! The girl at the counter was really nice and made us feel at home! She thanked us for coming in. The pizza had the perfect sauce to cheese ratio! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Was downtown for a concert at Consol (PPG Arena) and wanted to grab a bite to eat while we waited for the gates to open. Usually we eat somewhere inside the arena or before we come down but this time decided to see what we could find outside. Stumbled upon this place and it was great! Very nice lady at the counter welcomed us and gave us some menus to look at. Place was very clean and modern looking which gave it a very good feel. The quality of the food was pretty good as well especially for the price! I'm glad we decided to eat outside the arena this time, I discovered a new favorite place to grab a quick bite before events at the event center!"}
{"text":"Order takeout this past weekend while in town for the Steelers divisional playoff game. The weather was very poor and cold so not a lot of places were even delivering. We were very hungry and this was the quickest pizza delivery we could find. Unfortunately the pizza was not very good at all and I would not order from here again."}
{"text":"The food was delish!  It was a small quaint restaurant and it felt homey!  I would recommend this spot if you're looking for some yummy pizza or salad.  Their chicken sandwich was also very good!"}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza here during the Pens game - the service was to be expected for how busy they were. I was pleasantly surprised with how good the pizza was. Good crust, sauce was adequate and there was plenty of cheese.   My friend had the seafood pizza and said it was one of the best pizzas ever.   One bite, everybody knows the rules: 7.3"}
{"text":"Wanted to try this as it was a new place near work downtown and we like to go out for lunch a few times a week. I had high hopes but after a few visits now, I'm just not impressed by what you get for the price you pay. I've tried a Calzone, the Supreme Italian Hoagie (twice) and the Buffalo Chicken House Rolls.  The first time I was here I ordered the Hoagie while the people I was with got pizzas. Some other coworkers came in after us and got pizzas also. To my surprise, everyone who got pizza were called before me. I waited over 20 minutes for a sandwich!  I ended up walking downstairs and asking about my food and was told they misplaced my order. No apology or anything. They hurriedly threw together the sandwich and sent me on my way. I was not impressed to say the least however, the sandwich itself was pretty good.  I do feel like it was a bit pricey for what you got though.  On another occasion, I got the Calzone which also took a long time to be made. But at least it wasn't forgotten. This time I wasn't impressed with the food. There wasn't much filling in the Calzone and it was fairly bland. Certainly not worth what I paid. Next, I got the Hoagie again along with Buffalo Chicken House Rolls to share. Finally, food was prepared quickly and I was happy with my meal. 1 out of 3 times doesn't cut it for me. I have not been back because there are better options for Pizza and Hoagies in the area with better prices and deals.  If they had owned up to the early mistakes and perhaps showed a sign of good faith towards me, maybe I'd feel a bit differently but that first impression of losing/forgetting my order and then just blowing it off left an impact.  If I was asked to go back, I probably would but I would not be the one suggesting we go.  ***Update*** Well I was asked to go back. This is my second time back since my original review and things have just gotten worse. Ordered a Tuna Wrap today while others had pizza or salad. Quite literally the worst thing I've ever ordered.  Look at the pictures of this thing. Hard crusty wrap with a sprinkling of lettuce and half a tomato with the tiniest amount of 3 day old tasteless tuna!  Oh, and it took 20 minutes for it to come out. Pizzas and Salads were out before this again. They had to ask me what I ordered! Seriously? I've given it a second, third and fourth chance. I'm done!"}
{"text":"I ordered a slice of cheese to go and when I opened the box to eat it, the cheese was clearly burnt -- tasted like it had been made hours earlier and then reheated to the point where the cheese burned. One piece of advice - the garlic bread dipped in ranch was the star."}
{"text":"Its looks like Bosa will be one of our top 3 pizza places.. the wife really likes how pizza comes with the garlic butter sauce..!! The pizza was really good. Delivery was at decent times so far. Haven't tried much more than pizza yet.. till next review."}
{"text":"Great pizza.  I usually order a mini.  Thought I'd try something else, ordered a fish hoagie.  It was a whole lot of bread and not much fish.  I asked for hot sauce and they charged $1 extra for a small container. My friend requested ranch dressing for her salad and had to pay $1 for a small amount. The service is good and the place is clean.  Being that they are uptown (in the space formerly Brown Bag Deli), they might consider larger portions of actual food and not charging so much for extras. I'll stick with the pizza."}
