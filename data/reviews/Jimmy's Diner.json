{"text":"Awesome home style food, great service, and a nice cozy place.  We go here almost every weekend for breakfast"}
{"text":"Omg just went to this NON-POSITIVE dinner, got the rudest service EVER by the owner before the food was even ordered! As we are leaving, he says that he's going to have to call the cops for the coffee and orange juice we didn't even get a chance to touch. We said go ahead & left. NEVER come here.   We were ordering breakfast, and I asked for tomatoes instead of toast & he stops- Goes to the front  Brings back this huge sign at the entrance puts it in my face and points to  \"NO SUBSTITUTIONS\"  Like you couldn't say that? He continued to be rude while \"pretending\" to be apologetic.  I'm a small business owner myself & this is COMPLETELY unacceptable."}
{"text":"Went to Jimmy's Diner today for a late breakfast. The food was pretty darned good, though my hash browns were a bit greasier than necessary. The country fried steak was really good and my lady liked her breakfast as well   The only complaint I have with the place is the decor. The paint job on the outside is awful. The inside looks better than you'd expect but the decorations are a mishmash of styles that seem a little weird.  That said, the food was good and the service (from Mitch) was the best I've had in ages. Good coffee and my cup was never remotely close to empty."}

{"text":"Jimmys diner is great! The food is amazing and cheap. Basically you get a full plate for under 10 bucks. Not only that you get awesome service. The wait is minimal and the staff makes you feel like a friend not a customer. The whole experience makes you feel that warm diner atmosphere. I could eat there any day, and would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Jimmys was great, good food, good pricing, huge portions, super service. Now that they have changed owners and its called C J's Diner,  every rating is in the toilet,  would never go back.......................ever.  You can tell by the parking lot,  all employees must park out front to make it look like they are crowded."}
