{"text":"Many people won't admit the 'dirty secret', but Tandoori House is ALL about the buffet. It's a good buffet! The awesomeness here is that -- for the most part -- people whose tastes mostly revolve around buffet don't frequent the place. No ill manners, filthy tables, or sociopaths here!
     Please check out the Buffet here. The owner does a good job of offering quality Indian fare for those who like to budget."}
{"text":"Considering that I can dine at the Mirchi on 12th Ave. SW or at the Prime Tandoor on Edmonton trail and get totally authentic Pakistani food with generous portions and excellently prepared for half of what I would spend at Tandoori Hut, I see little incentive to eat here. The lunch buffet is boringly underspiced and many times dried out. The ala carte specialties are too small for the price you pay. For two bucks you get twice as much saffron rice (pilau) at the Mirchi as you do at Tandoori Hut who charges over double that. Do not get me wrong, their food has reasonable quality, rather than great, but they are quite overpriced which is a plague affecting all of Kensington lately.

At Prime Tandoor I can get 3 Naan, a meat curry, a vegetable curry, rice and soft drinks for less than $25. Their thali, a complete meal with rice, vegetables and meat cost only $10. Here it will cost you $40 for the first meal I described and your portions will be much much smaller.

For the intrepid, take a trek up to the Bombay Sweet House in Castleridge where you will get quality Indian Punjabi fare, the same as this establishment, for half the price as well as bigger portions and better preparation.

The Mirchi, Prime Tandoor, and Bombay Sweet House is where the Pakistanis and Indians go to eat. They are not licensed, but traditional Indo-Pakistani cuisine is not served with alcohol anyway. Serving alcohol is to cater to western tastes not South Asian. Lassi, water, and maybe soft drinks are the traditional fare."}
{"text":"I loved the chicken korma. One of the best I've had in Calgary. The lamb shai (similar tomato cream sauce as butter chicken) was very good. I wasn't crazy about the prawn curry and definitely wouldn't order it again. The vegetable pakoras were ok... nothing to rave about. 

I'd definitely go back... to have the korma, butter chicken or lamb shai."}
{"text":"Blandest Indian food I've had.
This was the worst meal I had in the longest time. The \"dal\" was what would be served to a sick person in a hospital - so.freaking.bland. 
This comes from a person who has had Indian food in all corners of the world. Just not worth your time, money and appetite."}
{"text":"This place has excellent food. It's so quiet and a nice place to hang out. The curry chicken is delicious, and you can get gluten free options if you need to. I definitely can't wait to go back here! It was not very pricey, the food came pretty quickly, and the atmosphere is pretty laid back. Very enjoyable!"}
{"text":"I came to the Tandoori Hut on Saturday for my friend's birthday. My friend arrived first at 7 pm, and they had no record of our reservation (my friend had booked it only a couple days before), but were still willing to seat us. Also, they had a sign up saying they were closing at 8 pm. If we knew they were closing early, we would've just made a reservation for an earlier time. The whole closing early thing made the experience uncomfortable because we felt pressured to order, eat, pay and leave as quickly as possible. We were hoping to stay and have my friend open her presents, but that had to happen elsewhere.

Also, the waitress proceeded to give us our bill when the birthday girl was still eating. I get you're closing early, but that is still rude and unprofessional. The food was okay. I had the Lamb Roganjosh, and found the cashews on top did not add anything to the dish. The naan was great. But, I'm really not sure if I'll return for a while. If I do, I'll double check whether they are closing early or not."}
{"text":"Wanting indian on a rainy Calgary evening, we decided to try Tandoori Hut for takeaway. After deciding on a few curries and vegetable pakoras, we placed our order and we're given a short 25 minute wait for pickup. 

The vegetable pakoras were nice, and it seems all places do these fritters a little differently. Our favorite part of the pakoras was the awesome fresh chutney that came along with it, I'm not sure exactly what it was but it seemed to be tomato based with a lot of heat, like flaming mouth hot. Lovely. 

The butter chicken was something I haven't had in a long time and their offering was quite good. Nice pieces of tender chicken in that tomato gravy we all love so much. One thing I will say is that the spices seemed a bit 'raw', and perhaps the curry would have done better to stew for longer.

The second curry we had was mutter paneer, which is lovely vegetarian curry of paneer cheese and green peas, one of my favorites. I found the flavor of this dish to be a bit underwhelming as well, more tomato coming through than anything in the gravy. 

The price is average and the pickup times for takeaway are short."}
{"text":"We came here with at party of 8. The food is delicious but the service was terrible!  Our waitress got our orders wrong - someone wanted beef and she put down chicken. And another one of our friends had to wait over 30 minutes for his food as they forgot about it."}
{"text":"I really like Tandoori Hut.

I have been here a few times and have enjoyed myself every time. I LOVE their tandoori dishes. Their tandoori platter, tandoori lamb chops, all of them absolutely delectable.

Last time I went, my friend and I shared the tandoori lamb chops and the chicken tikka masala. The food arrived and they have a little burner thing they put on your table, that they put all the food on, so it stays warm while you're eating. I loved that! I don't like when my food goes cold halfway through my meal. Anyway, we got 5 good-sized pieces of lamb chops for their tandoori lamb plate! So so so good, I wanted to eat it all... Their chicken tikka masala, was also excellent. The chicken was so soft it melted in your mouth, and it was also a really good portion! We both ended up taking a bit of food home. Made of delicious lunch the next day, mmmm..

It is nice to have a good Indian restaurant in Kensington. The place looks and feels fancy, but pricewise, is actually pretty average."}
{"text":"This is the kinda place I would keep going back to.
For our main course we had Chicken Biryani (meat baked with basmati rice and nuts) plus Lamb Bhuna (boneless lamb cubes prepared in a thick spicy sauce and garnished with coriander leaves). The latter was definitely my favorite and it was perfect with a glass of red wine."}
{"text":"Last time I was here was when they were still in the Osteria Medici block, so that's been many years. Family dinner out, had butter chicken, saag lamb, coconut curry shrimp, mushroom bhasmati rice, and mango lassi = East Indian \"comfort food\" plus Ras Malai and mango sorbet for dessert. Not spectacular, but competent. Reservations recommended."}
{"text":"real good food, service a bit on the slow side, but still it's good indian for sure! loved the chicken tikka, and the naan bread off course.. coconut curry is also a must/try!
good place to go for a weekend dinner, and u dont need reservations most of the time"}
{"text":"About ten years ago Tandoori Hut was the first restaurant I had ever tasted butter chicken and safe to say I was hooked!  The charred chicken, the creamy buttery tomatoey sauce paired with garlic naan was something I would jones for.  

Over the years I've probably tried a dozen or so other East Indian restaurants in Calgary and another dozen around Canada and the US but Tandoori Hut was always the benchmark for me.  Maybe because it was my first or maybe because they were just that good.  Unfortunately my last visit there left me very disappointed.  

Regardless of their food the staff at TH has never been their strong suit.  They're perpetually slow, never terribly friendly and always gave that feeling they want to be anywhere other than at work.  Until now that was fine since the quality and taste of the food made up for it.  

On the last trip there were four of us so we had enough people to get a good selection.  Saffron and coconut rice, garlic naan, butter chicken, coconut chicken, lamb korma, beef roganjosh, veg korma, dal and palek paneer.  The rice was dry and almost crispy.  The butter chicken tasted OK but didn't have the deep flavors I've come to expect.  The coconut chicken was rubbery (if I had to guess I'd say it was from a previous service and had been microwaved).  The lamb was very bland and had that \"lamby\" texture to it (yuck...shouldn't get that from new/fresh lamb).  The beef was unbelievably tough.  Both the veg korma and dal were very greasy and the palek paneer was ok other than the lack of the paneer (cheese).  In fairness the naan and samosa (I forgot to include it above, a couple of us started off with their beef samosas) were quite good.  

Really was disappointing experience for a few reasons.  First the obvious that it wasn't an enjoyable or tasty meal.  Second is that what was once a regular and favorite spot has slipped so badly.  Finally is that their prices have taken quite the jump.  I appreciate that things go up but they're now priced at a premium to other EI restaurants but aren't providing a premium product.  

Now on the hunt for my new favorite butter chicken joint!"}
