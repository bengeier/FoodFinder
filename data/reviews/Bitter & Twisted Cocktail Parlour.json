{"text":"Truly the worst service ever experienced. Wouldn't make room for a large party. Took a chair from a guest eating her food. Good food, just don't expect any service from management. Our server, Nicki, was awesome, management just needs to get it together."}
{"text":"Loved the drink special-a Moscow mule made w bourbon, and the good was quite good! I had the smashed chips, they were spicy and amazing-more like sliced potatoes covered in delicious toppings. my friends got the Seoul chicken and thought it was pretty good (although in pretty sure they expected a larger portion haha) I've been looking forward to checking this place out and I'm happy with the atmosphere and bartenders, had a lot of fun here."}
{"text":"Fun place, amazing drinks and excellent customer service. Kuddos to the guys at the bar. They know how to make top notch drinks!!"}
{"text":"Upscale atmosphere, fancy clothes, professional bartenders and true mixology, classy place... am I really in CenPho?  Maybe the district is growing up.   We went in and found a long and detailed menu, complete with graphs depicting where each drink lands on a scale so you can decide how adventurous you want to be.  But we didn't even use it, the bartender just asked us what flavors and liquors we liked, and he made something custom for us.  We also got the dessert in a cup, and it was amazing.  The bill did come to like $80 for 2 drinks each for 2 people, and 1 dessert.  So prepare yourself.  Also you likely need \"reservations\" to get in, since this place is busy.  I guess we looked the part since they just let us in anyhow, so maybe that is \"flexible\".  Yelp Review of the Day on the menu board is a nice and hilarious touch."}
{"text":"Bitter and Twisted.......Take 2   I headed back out to Bitter and Twisted last night for late night drinks with some friends.  I makes me happy to share that the service was very good!  The staff were very welcoming, and equally attentive and the drinks we ordered were wonderful.  I ordered the Russian Spring Punch, which I highly recommend to all.  Such a refreshing cocktail for a hot desert night.  I look forward to my next visit to Bitter and Twisted and will recommend to my friends and colleagues!"}
{"text":"This is a great new spot.  The cocktail menu is intimidating at 24 pages, but helps make for a fun experience, especially for infrequent drinkers.  You'll feel like you're one of the cool kids here."}
{"text":"This place is a joke! No standing at the bar, are you kidding me, that is what adds to the energy and vibe of world class bars.....or 'cocktail parlours.' I recently went there and ordered two Moscow Mules for my better half and I. I believe it was the owner who served me (middle aged white balding guy). I then ordered 2 more shots of vodka and he made a gesture as though I was a moron and there was enough alcohol in the drinks. There was enough liquor in the drinks I simply wanted two more shots of vodka. It's my preference to order this way as the paying customer but I must have insulted him. He then placed the two shots in front of my girlfriend and half jokingly said 'I hope I don't have to cut you off' to which I replied 'I have only ordered two drinks?!?' I was fuming as to be treated this way. He must of been pissed off because I was standing next to my woman who was sitting at the bar. What a joke this place and owner is, he has to remove himself as it has a lot of potential. Until then head to all the other cool places right around there including Hannys, Deuce, Blue Hound, Crescent, Barsmith and Arrogant Butcher....to name a few, which by the way ALL allow you to stand at their bars...."}
{"text":"Fun, interesting place to check out.  Great service and 60 plus drinks to choose from on their way cool menu. Menu can be overwhelming so check out the back page with the top drinks ordered.   Had a great time."}
{"text":"Oh my god. The service was too friendly, I'm from Pittsburgh and I just couldn't handle the hospitality. The pig belly was so fatty and rich, no words could describe the Unfathomable goodness, and the smores  fondue deal I got, so perfect I couldn't hate it. The cocktails were superb, I love all alcohols. For how swanky it is-everyone was so personable. I just couldn't take it!"}
{"text":"This place has cool classic drinks you would not think of ordering anywhere else. Hopefully, Yelp will post this because they only post things that make them money. Bitter & Twisted is old school with no tvs but fantastic drinks."}
{"text":"Overall I love this concept.  The space is immaculate with tall ceilings, concrete pillars with wood chips imbedded from the 20's, and the curtains & lighting are sure to impress your date.  Has been a month since they opened so it was just a short wait to get a booth at 9pm., but still a full house.  Staff were attractive and friendly.  I see this as a favorite watering hole when in the downtown core with dim lights and great music.  The plush couches keep you lingering for another drink.  We did not have any food on this trip, but I want to come back.  Having lived in NY, my critique of the drinks is set at a high standard given B&T is named  a \"cocktail parlor\". I think they need to figure the ice situation out.  Each drink felt like a buffet of ice. Yes it sounds petty, but small ice melts fast and waters down the cocktail within a couple minutes.  The \"Old Fashioned\" quickly diminished in taste after a couple sips as a single large cube is preferred with any whiskey/bourbon drink.  Secondly, ordered a caipirinha that came out in a highball packed with ice that lost it's intensity within a few minutes.  Some of the barware seemed mismatched with the cocktail and there was even fruity drink served in a tall pilsner style glass that was reminiscent of TGIF.   Like all restaurants that open there are kinks to work out and the execution will improve with repetition.  I put the ambiance at 5 stars and cocktails at 3.5 stars.   Still some work to do to keep pace with the competitive cocktail culture in downtown.  Can't wait to figure out what their signature cocktail that they'll be known for."}
{"text":"Have been coming here since their second week.  Love it!  The cocktails are pieces of art.  The art is fun and campy.  The bartenders really know their product.  No bubble gum vodka here!  The owner even came over and spoke to us about different liquors, and I must say, he has a lovely smile!  (They could use more local beer....SunUp brewing comes to mind)"}
{"text":"Bartenders were awesome and fast during crazy heavy Superbowl traffic. Try the pork belly and the mac n cheese.  Loved reading yelper of the week on the board.  Although cliche, hope to make it there."}
{"text":"the atmosphere in the downtown area had fantastic surroundings and cool look to a restaurant bar which made the interior very pleasant and nice. there was a huge selection of Mixology and various drinks. The bartenders are very nice cordial and seemed knowledgeable. I ordered the noodles with pork. After rave reviews by a couple of patrons I decided to eat it. the portion was adequate however the taste was less than desirable. The new laws were decent but the flavor tasted like burnt smokey thick sauce. The pork that was added to the noodles we're nothing more than the fat from the pig. Needless to say the dinner was short of average and definitely less than exceptional. I think the other rework the noodles with a different taste all together. other than that one menu item the place was pretty cool."}
{"text":"Even though I want to get on their yelpper of the week board, I don't have anything bad to say. I love the drinks they were spot on, and the bartenders really knew their stuff. The great thing was finding a place that loves doing classic drinks, but making them awesome. Cool atmosphere cool bar,"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place not too long ago and I am so glad we did. Although it is kind of tucked away and looks closed before walking in it is so neat and they have a great happy hour! The location of being right downtown is perfect. Delicious drinks and great eats! Will definitely return."}
{"text":"This is the best place in all of downtown Phoenix. Their cocktails are amazing and their foot is very good. I enjoyed the Cellar Door Cocktail while my husband enjoyed an Old Fashioned. We came back twice during our short visit to downtown Phoenix and on the second visit ordered food. You must try the Hurricane Popcorn. We also had the Ramen Burger and Smashed Chips. Some of the best food in the area. The place has character.  Ask for Jason at the bar, he is wonderful!"}
{"text":"After visiting I can tell that Phoenix as a city is growing in sophistication.  This Place is hitting so many notes that most people can't even notice aside the ones that absolutely have to go out of their way no matter what time in the morning to explain; e.g. myself (it's 4 am ). It has trend, isn't fake, and the bartenders are some of the best I've seen from presentation, smiles, and concern for your safety. I am excited for the super bowl events to be downtown just so this place can get some more national coverage, as it is impossible for it not to be noticed. There is so much going on, really there is. Check it out! Just please show some respect, if you want to get so wasted you're throwing up, there are about 10 bars within walking distance to do so. If  you can't control yourself or think that your \"business reputation\" will make them break the law , think again!   In order to get why this place works you'd have to know what makes a man a man, a woman a woman, and a bartender a bartender.   Food is fun as hell! You might not realize what you're getting... but keep in mind King's couldn't get food like this a century ago and some Kings and Presidents still can't. You're getting food and drinks like this in a valley, in a desert that was never supposed to thrive; keep that in mind the next time you sip on one of these cocktails and a bartender flares while being slammed with business. Never seen things look so good while the people that work there are making it look so easy.    \"Even when I'm working people think I'm chillin.\" - Andre Nikatina"}
{"text":"I loved the food and the drinks were amazing! Our table of 4 bill was over $200 but it was a great time. I did order a drink and the waitress gave me warning that it is sweetened with bitters, I said I like bitters. When it came out it was definitely not what I was expecting, no biggie. I told her that I would pay for it and ordered another drink that I knew was delicious. The manger came up and said he would comp my drink but gave me \"rule of thumb if the server is telling you something to listen because they know the drinks, next time just save the bartenders time and a drink that your aren't going to like\". Well the lecture for a drink that I said I would pay for was pretty unnecessary. Other than that though I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Randomly came in because we were looking for something new, staff was super friendly and was patient when we didn't understand the drink menu. (Mango mojito was amazing!) food was different, but great! Would definitely come back for happy hour."}
{"text":"This place is great. We came in for a quick cocktail but after the amazing Lemongrass Collins, we stayed for more drinks and food as well."}
{"text":"I just wanna be the yelper of the week!! Holla!! Place was great, drinks were great, great bartenders!!"}
{"text":"Showed up at 10:00pm, several tables open and seats at the bar; was told it's a 30-45 minute wait. Sorry but you already seem too pretentious, for someone that lives walking distance, maybe I'll see you again during happy hour on a Tuesday - maybe. Don't forget you're a bar in phoenix not NYC. I'm already bored."}
{"text":"Drinks and food was good! We got the ramen burger and mac & cheese w/bacon. They were both good but my favorite was the mac & cheese. Would def go again."}
{"text":"What a find. True, rear, craft cocktail bar. They have all homemade juices, no $hit Red Bull drinks, no \"fruity pebble\" three olives vodka, and bartenders that don't need a manual to make a crafted cocktail. They offer the REAL James Bond martini, pure old fashions, and about 50 other menu drinks that usually are reserved for what you Google before going to order your next round. Oh, and regular Nintendo at every table. This. Place. Is. Awesome. Thanks, Tim!"}
{"text":"First visit, will return.  Unlike others posting reviews, we had no problem being seated at 6:00 at the bar. We actually had two bartenders, one of which said nothing and was very slow. The other however was very engaging and a pleasure to speak with. Drinks and food were very good, we will be back."}
{"text":"Coolest place in Phoenix. Great drinks, great service. Modern but retro. The drinks are a work or art. Go there"}
{"text":"This place had chill feel to it. Perfect place for us all to relax and try a few cocktails after a crazy day of festivals. The cocktail list was impressive and we all ordered something different so we could pass them around and try a bit of everything. Had a few good ones but honestly, most weren't that impressive and we tried A LOT of them. So it wasn't really worth the higher prices and small glasses. Some had really wierd crap in it and that's not my thing, personally. Like Earl grey tea with cucumber something or other. But the staff seemed friendly enough. It was definitely clean and good atmosphere for that time of day. It started to fill up with more customers and it was becoming more of a cocktail attire scene which is fun but I wasn't dressed for the occasion so I started to feel out of place. We debated eating but the food was not my style. Over all, good experience. We may be back but for that much money I'd probably go somewhere I can get more for it."}
{"text":"1. Ambiance is great 2. Food looked great -- didn't eat, should have 3. Drinks, basically overpriced Kool-Aid 4. Staff -- expect minimum of 18% gratuity, for what, I don't know 5. Return visit ---- nah...maybe my standards are a little high being from Chi-Town"}
{"text":"love Love LOVE this new pub!  So different and fresh- especially for downtown PHX.  The atmosphere is classic like a great bar in NYC or Chicago.  Really like the Scottish touch.  Bartenders were super friendly.  How ironic that amongst all the great beer and spirit offerings you can get a bottle of Schlitz!  Will definitely make this a regular hang."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place! Great service, tasty food, awesome cocktails and a great atmosphere. I will definitely stop in the next time I am in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"This place is a perfect mix of a speakeasy and almost a lounge. The menu is small but has great items. I tried the yum yum noodles and the ramen burger and I loved the yum yum noodles.  The cocktails are outstanding. There are plenty of choices that will fit your want. The bartenders are outstanding."}
{"text":"I can't even begin to explain how amazing this place is. The absolute best atmosphere, bar food that puts standard restaurant fare to shame, and 31 pages of drinks. That is not a typo. 31 pages! We enjoyed a great sampling of their options, and with a happy hour that goes until 7, you can't beat the deals."}
{"text":"Food was good once we finally got it. The service was SLOW, we ordered the spicy popcorn for an appetizer .... Never got it ... Asked for it twice finally took it off the order. When the order FINALLY came it was not right... No pork belly on the noodles .... They brought a second order which was good. Then the check was rung up incorrectly so had to wait for that to be corrected.... With all the choices downtown.... We will not be going back."}
{"text":"The redhead's cocktail hit my spot. What a Tequila Mockingbird!"}
{"text":"I've got to say, I was impressed! The hostess tells us they're on about a 45 min wait, as they're at capacity. Rather than send us away, she offers to take our phone number, if we'd like to walk around, and she'd text us for out table. Normal right? We the part that was impressive, was that she continued to text us updates on our status. This was impressive, since she gave us time to make our way back, without just a quick text, \"your table is ready\". The server was menu ready and attentive, helping us decipher  our beverages of choice. The grilled cheese with Cotija was amazing! We will definitely be back to check out more of their specialty drinks. I can definitely see why this place was at max capacity!"}
{"text":"The staff, with the exception of the hostess, was sooo unfriendly.  The \"mixologists\" need a few drinks themselves to loosen up a bit.  I mean, it's okay... mixing a drink is not that serious so... relax!!"}
{"text":"Great drinks and good music... Love the Pork Belly. Staff is beyond friendly and bar tenders are on their game. They know exactly what they are doing. I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Had the best time here during our road trip through Phoenix.  Located in a beautiful historic building, cool setting.  And like every other yelper stated, the \"yelper of the week\" crappy review is put up on the board for all to see... HILARIOUS! ... and ridiculous at the same time! How could anyone give this place a crappy review?  Their menu is a wonderful storybook for those of us who want to drink our way \"through the looking glass,\" filled with a myriad of concoctions for the bartenders to whip up for you.  Or if you prefer, they'll just make something up suited to your taste.  Not a gin drinker at all, but the Vesper martini was pretty delicious.  The menu was fabulous.  The pork belly buns were to-die-for!  If you get the chance...GO!  *** Tim, the Bartender... You were awesome.  Thank you for the great service, the amazing martini, and the brewery recommendation."}
{"text":"great dumpling burger, really unique place, good menu items and just perfect for a cocktail."}
{"text":"Visited B&T for the first time last night. It was Friday and DT Phx was hopping. The place was busy but my friend and I got two seats at the bar without waiting (They were the only 2, it was busy). I'd heard great things and was not disappointed. We mostly had drinks and every single one was good. I tried the kafir lime cc, the solero, and a classic martini. All hit the spot and the service was impeccable. I loved the atmosphere and the chips were to die for. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Try to go with friends. Not full inside, but announced waiting time: 30 min. Bar seating was only offered on request, we left because we needed 2 more seats and that required asking three guests to just move 2 seats further at the bar. Obviously no  drive to have customers..."}
{"text":"Came here for a drink after dinner. The dim lighting added to the atmosphere, but made it difficult to read the extensive menu. That ended up being a good thing. Our mixologist, Jason, was excellent in making us different drinks we would have not normally chosen, but were all amazing! A place you don't want to miss out on in downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"ross simon make the best ramos gin fizz in the history of mankind!!!!! jealousy has over taken me!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place S-U-C-K-S!!!  Can't get a table, can't stand, can't get service. The staff, owners, etc...rude beyond words. I think the only reason there r any 5 star reviews is either family, friends, staff, or people were paid to post them. The later it gets the more they profile against darker skin color. Don't foresee these D-Bags making it very long by running a business this way."}
{"text":"Really love the ambiance of this place... Drink selection is amazing, but not cheap. You are paying for the amazing ambiance too. :)"}
{"text":"If you are looking to enjoy wonderful drinks in a very chic environment this is a place that you won't want to pass up. They have an extensive drink menu so there is something for everyone no matter your how particular your tastes are.   Their food menu isn't as extensive as their drink menu but they have great food as well. I recommend their take on fish and chips."}
{"text":"Tim was awesome! Great drinks and excellent service! Don't be overwhelmed by drink menu...bartender are happy to help guide you and know their stuff."}
{"text":"We've been here twice, so it's fair to say we like it.  This place is awesome! We've always come earlier when they open at 4pm, so I can't speak for these reviews that comment on it later on. We have only had positive experiences here, never too crowded we've always been able to be seated. It does fill up quickly. We have sat in both the bar and dining side we enjoy both.  The food here is AMAZING. SO good. We tend to get a few bits between the two of us and share so we can try different things. Between the two visits we've tried a fair amount- nothing has disappointed but there are some stand out favorites. The dragon burger get it- ITS AMAZING. Also their mac n cheese is no joke hands down the BEST mac we have ever ever ever had. A co worker of mine had been here first and sold me with talking about their mac. If you come here you must try it you wont regret it. But like I said all the food is great you cannot go wrong.   The cocktails obviously their specialty do no disappoint. Really great drinks. They taste amazing and they don't skimp on the alcohol. They taste as they should and are crafted really well.  We've also had really great luck with the service and servers, friendly, quick, & informative.  All around great place and we've already started trying to figure out when we will be back and we're always recommending it to people. Look no further- just come in and give this place a try!"}
{"text":"The staff was great and the drinks were amazing.  This is one of the coolest places and we will defiantly be returning."}
{"text":"Every cocktail I've had here has been fantastic. The food is also top notch; the ramen burger is a must-try and my girlfriend and I order one every time we come in.  Try to sit at the bar if you can though, table service has been less than stellar the times we have had it. Last time we went in to try the new fish and chips our server \"forgot\" to put our order in and they ran out by the time we asked about it."}
{"text":"Food was delicious but the real draw is the unique drink menu. Here's your opportunity to try something completely different.  Had the pretzel burger and it was perfect...better than the ramen burger my wife had.  Wife asked for an amaretto-based drink and bartender deliver a home run.  Not sure what was in it, but it was multidimensional and wife loved it.  My drinks were tasty without being sweet. Well done. I'd sit at bar next time.  Waitress was neither attentive nor helpful."}
{"text":"I have never \"Yelped\" before, but this establishment inspired me to help them out in any way I can.  There are not very many unique and awesome places to go out and focus on the company with which you are traveling. Most bars are filled with 100 TV screens showing various sporting events. These places are fine for when I would like to see a specific game, but when I am not at the bar to watch sports even golf can distract one from a good conversation.  This place has a few components that make it the best bar I've been to in Phoenix. The first are the bartenders. I have been here twice and both times have had the pleasure of sitting at the bar. It was refreshing that the owner Ross was actually one of the people behind the bar serving drinks; it shows that he is passionate about his investment as well as his craft. Jason was another bartender who was incredibly nice and somehow found the time to actually talk to my wife and I between making drinks. We never wanted for a drink and both Jason and Ross helped my wife and I to select drinks that matched our palettes. Both were spot on every time.  Second is the atmosphere. Ross' vision for the bar itself is truly worth seeing. As I mentioned before there are no TVs to detract from the decor. It is speak-easyesque but with a modern flare. It is dimly lit and intimate, with appropriate music, and all stone and brick inside. While being there you absolutely feel like you are in an upscale cocktail bar. Reminds me a bit of something I would have hoped to find in downtown Chicago where I grew up.  Third are the drinks. After all that is what we came here for. The menu is expansive and with the strength of each cocktail it will take more than the two visits we've had to become fully acquainted with the selections. That said the cocktails that my wife and I have tried (6 between the two of us) have all been superb. They also have a decent Scotch list and Jason knew his way around this subject as well. The drinks do take a while to make but I consider that part of the experience. I saw zero premade mixes, every cocktail was hand crafted, shaken, and poured. Considering how large the menu is it is quite impressive that the are able to memorize it all and get it right the first time every time. The prices are not expensive for what you get. Anyone expecting to receive a tab at the end of the night matching your local watering hole missed the point from the start. The prices are justifiable and I will happily continue paying them.  Finally, I wanted to address some of the negative (one or two star) posts that I have read. I would note that most of those posts are now six months or so old. As this is a new bar, it apparently had (as with all new start-ups) some growing pains. That said, I can assure any  reader that they have been dealt with. We were not hassled at the door, we were seated promptly, served promptly and the experience was spectacular.  I will highly, highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a fresh take on the bar scene or for a fantastic cocktail done right. Thank you for the great experiences!"}
{"text":"Awesome upscale (but not ridiculously expensive) cocktail bar.  Excellent list of cocktails and some pretty good food. Definitely Uber here!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool. Its a little fancy for my taste. The drinks are pricey but they are premium. So many options its hard to pick. If you get a good waitress they will help you navigate the menu but if you dont, you might get stuck with a drink that you hate. The tacos were awesome. I also tried the ramen burger, its good but I would prefer it on lettuce or regular bread. Pretty unique place if you are just here for a few days but not a place to go on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Bitter & Twisted offers great service and a cool ambiance that recalls a lounge in New York or Vegas. However, execution on food and drink is underwhelming and unoriginal.   B&T offers an extensive list of cocktails - in fact, an overwhelming amount. The booklet is several pages deep listing every common cocktail. B&T does offer a short print out of some marquee drinks, but again, unoriginal options listing classics such as a Manhattan. The premise of B&T is that bartenders can whip up something custom just based on guest's taste, so it's superfluous to offer such an extensive list of drinks everyone already knows.   My husband and I skipped the directory and ordered based on the kind of liquor and style of drinks we prefer. Our drinks were fine, but lacked complexity and originality. Based on its local accolades, we were expecting some muddled fruit, house-made bitters and ironic combinations. Instead, our drinks were just a quick shake of fruit juices and liquor - fine, but simple enough to make at home.   We also ordered some food, which was the most disappointing part of our experience. The meat & cheese plate presentation was bland, amateur and did nothing to enhance the food. We did like the pâté and meats, but otherwise found the cheese selections too similar  - same consistency, similar flavor profile. The Yum Yum noodles (ordered with chicken) were over salted and contained minimal chicken. The Fattoush salad featured soggy croutons and overall tasted as if it had been prepped several hours prior.  My advice for management: take pride in what's local and use more desert fruit to inspire custom drinks. Trim down the menu and highlight a few select, original concoctions brewed up by your staff.  We can shake our own drinks, so offer something more unique for the prices you're charging."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here after reading the reviews on Yelp. The bar is set in an old building, quite charming, ans the bartender gave us a bit of history. He then asked what we liked to drink and proceeded to mix up a very tasty concoction, based on the info we have him. The staff was very friendly and we had a great time. In fact, we returned in Sunday, only to find out the were closed."}
{"text":"I don't drink whiskey but my boyfriend ordered a Manhattan; I stuck my tongue in it and it was good!"}
{"text":"Amazing is the only word that comes to mind. This one-of-a-kind cocktail bar located in the heart of downtown Phoenix is raising the bar for the Phoenix cocktail scene. I have had the opportunity to try a few of the 70 STELLAR artfully crafted cocktails in the 24 page Book o' Cocktails, and each is equally as good as the next. If you like drinks on the sweeter side try the Lime in the Coconut or the Tiramisu... But one of my favorites is the Kaffir Lime CC--House infused kaffir lime gin and house made lime cordial carbonated and served straight up.  The food knocks it out of the park as well. The Hurricane Popcorn could be one of the most addicting things I have had in a long time. The Ramen and the Smashed chips are a must as well.  I'm not sure what everyone else is griping about--the service was above and beyond each time I visited.  I think some people fail to realize that these are not your average pre batched cocktails. Each is hand poured, hand shaken, hand stirred, hand muddled...are you seeing a pattern? Give an extra minute or two -- each drink is made with love.   A MUST TRY for any one in the downtown area."}
{"text":"We stopped by for couple of drinks last weekend. Place looked very promising and fun till I ordered my $12 drink. I don't like ice for my drink and I specified to the waiter \" Light very easy ice for mine, please\" . When my drink arrived the glass was full of ice ( what?), it was hard to believe it was even space left for any liquid. I pointed it to the waiter, she took drink   and came back with half glass empty explaining  that they did corrected their mistake spooning out as much ice from the glass as they could . When I asked \" Why you just didn't replace the drink?\" , I got an answer \" what else do you want us to do with your drink?\"  Well, I ended up with having a 1/3 glass of untouched yet drink for $12.  I have been in many high -end and not places with an exceptional and not so great customer service.  This one was the worst I have ever would imagine such a poor customer service from pretty pricey places.  To make a point clear:  When ordering a Starbucks drink with light ice would you leave with half empty glass or cup ?????  Pretty sad..... it could be one of the fun places for me to go but honesty and great customer service is important and fortunately it is still easy to find in many other places for less buck and more attention to the customers."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best drinks I have ever been served.  Watching the magicians prepare each drink is something to see.  The food is top notch and in a class of it's own.  My first stop every time I land in town.  Make the trip.  You will not be sorry."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar. We waited 5 minutes for someone to lay down a menu and  waited another 10 minutes for the bartender  to take our order. It took another 10-15 minutes for the drinks to be made. First impression was the place itself and the drinks were nice but the service was sloooow.  Our friends joined us and we ordered another round. 10 minutes later, no drinks, and the bartender came back and said he forgot what we ordered. No bueno. I understand these drinks are complex but they weren't even busy, just unorganized. And you guessed it, another 15 minutes from ordering (for the second time) until we got our drinks.  On a positive note we ordered the burger and tacos and they were really, really good.   The bartenders were really cool, super friendly so I hate to bag on them for the slow service but it was bad. Will I come back? Sure, just not for a while. Hopefully they find their flow.  Update: Somehow ended up back here a week after my first visit. I warned my friend who wanted to try it about my first experience but she insisted. After waiting 15 minutes to be acknowledged we left. The service here is a joke! I've had better service at jack n the box. Get it together soon! Doubt I'll ever come back."}
{"text":"I vacillated between two and three stars and the two won out in part because \"Cocktail Parlour\" is in their name and I expected way more from the experience and presentation.  We visited on a Saturday evening (8pm).  We sat at a table and this was our first mistake.  I think that I would have had a better experience if I sat at the bar and had a chance to see the \"mixologist\" at work.     We ordered food -- a cheese plate...lame, and Green Chile Mac and Cheese (added bacon) -- a WINNER.    But my devastation lay in the drinks and the presentation.  While we did not find fault in the taste of the drinks, I felt the presentation was lacking.   None of the drinks we ordered were out of the ordinary -- Chocolate Martini, a Bellini, and the drink of the night.  None came with any fanfare, and yet, tasted like any other Chocolate Martini or Bellini you might have ordered at Lucky Strike or Copper Blues (both located across the street).  They could have rimmed or garnished the Chocolate Martini or created a Chamborde swirl in the Bellini.   Nothing.  My expectation is that if all you serve are cocktails, and, by the way, charge an arm and leg for them, then maybe you should serve them with some fanfare.    Frankly, I would rather go to Fez or Hanny's for my Chocolate Martini."}
{"text":"Rude service ;( waitress Virionna rolled her eyes when we ordered. Really bummed. Pricey drinks as well. I was charged $ 2 for one single olive in a dirty martini on top of the $12 martini price tag. Yikes!!!!! $2 per olive!?! Forget this place- move on."}
{"text":"This is the best pace to go for happy hour in downtown Phoenix the drinks and atmosphere are amazing and the owner has a Scottish accent it doesn't get better that my friends!!!"}
{"text":"Glad to be review number 400 for this place; straight out a noir graphic novel, I finely lit prohibition watering hole that makes you glad the 21st amendment was repealed.   Went in for a friends Feelin' 22 bday bash and were very surprised at this bar tucked away in the corner of an Art Deco building; hand crafted cocktails (beyond creamy White Russians) and small plates make it my new favorite fancy ass place in downtown."}
{"text":"Wish I had known about this place sooner. Reminds me of Trader Vic's in Old Town before they closed down, no tropical theme. But a great cocktail bar none the less. Sat at the bar with a buddy and Jason was our bartender. He was very knowledgeable on the drinks and made great variations on what we suggested. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and it's always been really enjoyable. The cocktail menu is serious but the servers are very knowledgeable and helpful if you need some ideas. The cocktails are moderately priced and many of the liqueurs used are made in house. I love a good gin cocktail and highly recommend The Wibbley and their version of a Corpse Reviver. The food menu is small but has good variety; they stop serving their full menu after 11pm and switch to a late night menu. I love the green chile mac n cheese, anything with the noble bread, and I just had the yum yum noodles with pork belly, which was very tasty.   I have to say Bitter and Twisted is the best cocktail bar I've been to in downtown Phoenix. The only downside is actually getting into the bar. You have to wait outside while they make sure a table is available. I've never had a problem getting a table on a Friday but Saturdays can be very busy."}
{"text":"They took... never mind, this was going to be a bad review but a nice bald gentleman who appears to be in management apologized for the absence of our server. In addition, he gave all 7 of us a shot on him!"}
{"text":"I have heard the buzz of mixed reviews. I get it. The cocktails aren't cheap and overly sweet... However, if you talk to your server, I'm looking at you Beth, they will listen to what you like and don't like and give you the best cocktail of your life! I wanted something bitter, dry and gin based. I got exactly that for market price and with a side of wit. I will be returning!"}
{"text":"More than any sum of money, any degree, any medal, any life achievement or recognition...there is absolutely nothing in this precious world I want more that to be the \"Yelper of the Week\" at Bitter & Twisted.   -Brian McC"}
{"text":"B&T thinks it's hilarious to tease patrons with the potential to consume high spirited cupcakes that are always SOLD OUT. Leaving bitter... and twisted."}
{"text":"Fantastic place for classic cocktails. Knowledgeable and very friendly bartenders. Belly buns were delicious. Looking forward to coming back and trying their green chili mac and cheese.  But I'm only saying this so I can be their \"Yelper of the Week.\"   PUT ME ON YOUR BOARD!"}
{"text":"What a FANTASTIC new place for downtown Phoenix!!! I predict this will be my new favorite place!!! I've been in 3 times and have had nothing but wonderful drinks, interesting but delicious food, and friendly service!!! The cocktails are all handcrafted and absolutely delectable!! My favorite is the Kaffir Lime served on the rocks! I have also enjoyed an Old Fashion and many others on the menu. Although it has Been packed a few times I've tried to go in.. It will not deter me from trying again. The food and especially the drinks are well worth it!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place! The drinks AND the food are amazing. Hard to find that combo in PHX. Speciality drink combos are made in house, nothing artificial. The staff is awesome too!"}
{"text":"Came here last Saturday night to celebrate my birthday.  Hostesses went out of their way to find a table for us and the service was extremely professional and personal. The food was absolutely amazing and the drinks were just as great. Definitely going to be coming back!"}
{"text":"Such a fun great place! We had gone before a concert and they had a long wait so we opted to come back later that evening and the hostess was so sweet and handed us a card for an app to put us on the wait list when we were about 20 minutes away so we wouldn't have to wait again! So sweet! Then we came back and got right in thanks to this app had a great server, Nicole who kept us smiling and laughing the entire time!! Definitely worth at least a drop by for one drink If anything else!!"}
{"text":"Industrial - modern - good service - urban feel. It's a good place for an intimate conversation"}
{"text":"This is one of those places where you can be a complete cocktail snob and the bartenders know exactly how to make it. You get a booklet of extensive craft cocktails if you're not sure what you want and if you're hungry I can at least recommend every single one of their appetizers and desserts. I haven't had the entrees yet but don't really ever need to because this place gets 5 stars for the delicious cocktails and service alone."}
{"text":"Top-notch mixology and great ambience. Highly recommend the Seoul - fried chicken.  The staff really knows their line of drinks."}
{"text":"Bitter&twisted lies.   Ross you where selective with guest.  After you rudely treated us and now give us excuses.  We watched you question nobody after us.   Weak!!!!!!! No help to downtown! !!!"}
{"text":"If pretentiousness is your cup of tea this is the place.  Beyond that it's hard to see any attraction.  You'd think hoity-toity would be better quality.  Pedestrian premiums hardly justify pricey airs and attitude."}
{"text":"Pros: Drinks and Decor  Cons: Expensive, very long wait times, inattentive and condescending staff.  Two of us went last Saturday evening to meet friends and the hostess told us the wait was 1 hour and 45 minutes.  Our friends were already inside and came out to get us, but the hostess wasn't happy about it.  We probably wouldn't have gotten in if our friends hadn't already racked up a large tab.  Hostess said something about fire code only allowing 125 total people in the bar, which may or may not be true.  The cocktails are pricey, but pretty good.  The decor and building are excellent.    Overall, expect to be treated like you're at the front door of an overrated Scottsdale club (all that's missing is the red rope), which is very a-typical for the downtown area and won't be put up with for long.  Long unnecessary wait times and condescending staff also don't help.  I won't be going back for a while until they crowds and hype die down and they start getting desperate for business."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time for date night and LOVED it! Great atmosphere and decor. Great place to just chill and have a good time. Their drink menu is very extensive, and the bartenders are great at giving you ideas and making your drink any way you want. Jason was great, we really enjoyed watching him make the drinks with so much passion ;) very entertaining! We need more places like this in Phoenix. Pricey but worth it, will definitely be back. #drinkbetter"}
{"text":"The drink menu is as big as the Cheesecake Factory food menu!"}
{"text":"We're still as nerdy as ever, but today we come here and map out our drinks, whereas before we used to stay home and map out dungeons in D&D. It will cost a couple of gold coins, and there is no Elven Ale served in this pub, but coming here is undoubtedly an experience. They've a few gluten free things on the menu. I enjoy the meat and cheese platter, though it is not entirely GF. The staff is friendly, patient and helpful. The beverage menu....it goes on and on... My favorite is the Mon Cherie, a stunning combination of chocolate and cherry that manages to be refined and haunting. The Godfrey is a favorite. Talking of haunted, my husband used to work in the building and tells me that the building is reported to have a phantom, though unfortunately not in the restaurant place itself. The place has a terrific old-timely setting, so uncommon in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This place is great!  They serve amazing cocktails and have a real dedication to the craft.  They could not have been nicer.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Flash back to a better era, venue is swanky and cool, drinks are an explosion of goodness in your mouth...ZING!  A womp bop a looma a womp bam boom!"}
{"text":"Cocktail fiend? Read no further, just go. Not into cocktails? You will be after this place. There aren't a lot of drinks I would pay over $12 for, and even fewer good enough to warrant a second round, but Bitter and Twisted has it right. They've managed to craft a cocktail menu that is not only massive, but also well-curated - it's approximately novella length, but the mixologists here are skilled enough that it doesn't feel excessive. Plus, the food is great. Seriously, just go."}
{"text":"This place is aptly named.  I was Bitter and Twisted when I left.  The waitress smirked when I asked about a life threatening allergy, was sexist towards women, and the place had a horrible wait while the table we were eventually seated at was open for 45 min.  The service is rude, rude rude.  Do not eat here.  The food is mediocre and not large enough for a meal and the drinks are all ice for a $10 plus cocktail.    We were quoted to have a 30 min to 45 min wait and ended up waiting an hour and a half!  The reason why we didn't leave was because  the table we eventually ended up sitting at was clear for the last 45 min of our wait.  We kept thinking, just a little while longer.  We had a party of three and for the first 20 min two of us sat at the bar because that was the only seating space.  We tried to order and the bartenders ignored us the whole time we sat there. When our other friend showed up we were forced to stand for an hour and ten min right in front of the door.    They have no seating for people waiting. Just a railing for maybe three people to lean on.   If you don't have a reservation, FOR A BAR, then this place will not serve you well.  My friend ordered a water and the waitress said yes then ignored him for 45 min until she had to serve us.  During that time at least 10 groups of two or more people were turned away because of the insane wait for already open tables.  The music is loud crappy electro swing.  If Bitter and Twisted wants to go with the classy jazz age, I suggest some Ella Fitzgerald or Duke Ellington.  Looping a hack DJ set of electronic head throbbing \"jazz\" does not create a chill ambiance, rather just a headache.    Once we were seated at the table, which had been open for the last 45 min, the waitress  tells us that we  need to wait for water because this horrible business does not have enough clean water cups.    When I order my food I ask if their eggS (plural)  and beetS (plural) dish is large enough for a meal.  \"For you it will be.\"  I find it sexist that just because I am a girl a meal for me should consist of 4 potato slices that are no larger than two quarters and barley make up 1/4 of one potato, four dime sized pieces of  a beet, and one hard boiled egg is a meal for a woman. I had been waiting for an hour and a half!  The dish should be called one egg and 1/8 beet.  I had to fill up on water and the ice from my drink.  My drink was a ten dollar ice cup with a little lemonade flavored alcohol garnished with a mint leaf.  My friend has a deadly food coloring allergy.  He wanted to taste my beverage.  When I asked if there was any food coloring in it, the waitress wrinkled her face into a very unbecoming sour puss crinkle and said no.  I'm sorry that you, waitress, were offended by a question that could save this horrible establishment a legal nightmare and my friend his life.  This place is too cool and busy to serve you.  If you are anorexic and enjoy being treated like shit you might like this place, otherwise stay away."}
{"text":"I understand this is a 21 and over establishment, this is not a reason for the hostess to walk away from the guest she is talking to to let us know that we need to leave as babies aren't allowed inside. We were walking by randomly, we were in the front area waiting to talk to a host. This message could have been explained in a polite manner, instead we will never be back when we don't have the baby with us...The attitude we experienced today 1/20 4:30pm was completely ridiculous and unacceptable...my fiancé and I are both in the service industry, understand rules, but there is a right and wrong way to let people know."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that have excellent handcrafted vintage cocktails and really delicious foods! A great gem to take visitors when in town to enjoy the unique architecture of the Luhrs building. Ross and his team create a exciting atmosphere, just because you might wait extra long for your cocktails doesn't mean the quality isn't there, it's well worth the wait every time!!! It's a must see when you are in Downtown Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Love the place, but not the blonde grinch that was working with the hosts up front. She needs to take the stick out of her @$$. Waited for 2 hours for our table, and she smirked back with a shitty attitude when I asked why it was taking so long. I've been here plenty of times and am a pretty patient person. Hoping she doesn't work here anymore so I can return"}
{"text":"One of the gems of downtown Phoenix for sure. Cocktails are on another level. The menu is simple, but heavenly. If it give it a go the two things on the menu that would want to make you come back, if the drinks weren't enough, are: Yum Yum Noddles and THAT ramen noddle burger. Good Heavens. Awesome vibe, but could be somewhat difficult to find a spot so head at an early time or plan on hanging out a the bar for a few, but I feel like sitting at the bar and interacting with the bartenders makes this place grand. Don't hesitate to stop here! You'll come back."}
{"text":"Lime and the coconut is the best cocktail I've ever had. Great place for after work (although don't expect great deals during happy hour). Food was unusual and not great, but the drinks were definitely worth another visit. Nice ambience as well."}
{"text":"Came here before a concert. It was ok. Nice place to come try drinks. They have a ton! And a very confusing chart that I did not bother to try to understand lol .. Food was also ok. I ordered their cheese plate. Not the best combo and they had an interesting/tasteful sage infused cheese and their pate was good. The meats and bread were both a little dry. Friends also ordered fried chicken wrap, hurricane popcorn and (I think) mini tacos of some sort. Everything was ok. Service was good considering they let us in this time.. Will probably come back for drinks but for food the neighboring restaurants (arrogant butcher and Hannys) are better choices.."}
{"text":"Probably one of, if not the, worst experience I've had in recent years.  When the highlight of your experience is laughing at a message board on the wall that describes the \"social media post of the week\" and the details rave against the spot - I'll take that as a self-admitted hint not to return.  During a humid summer day, my girlfriend meant to meet me here for drinks and a bite before a show.  She was told there was a 45 min. wait for two people. As she stood in the \"lobby\" (a bed sheet wrapped close around the front door entrance, the hostess told her that she'd have to wait outside.  Approx. 60 seconds later, I arrive and meet my gf outside the front door.  When we ultimately decide just to sit at the bar, we're told it's a 25 min. wait for the bar.  As someone walks through the sheet, I point out to the hostess that there are a number of empty seats at the bar to which she responds, \"yeah, there's a wait.  Our bar is pretty popular.\" No more than 5 min. goes by before another hostess says there's space at the bar and she could show us in.  Guess what, while walking to the far side of the bar, I count 4x 6-person tables and a number of other seats that are untaken by even ghosts. To top if off, we're later asked to move so that the newest hostess can squeeze 3 people into 2 chairs at the bar and one stand (one seat on either of us) as we're trying to pay and leave.  The cocktails were decently priced, but overly sweet or overly poured.  The food was lackluster, and the overall environment is what I would imagine a retro-millennial dorm room to look like if I gave them $1,000 budget.  I won't return again, and I've already warned people not to risk it."}
{"text":"So good! My friend and I were in town for a work conference and stumbled upon this place. We had a few different cocktails, grilled cheese bites, and the green chili Mac and cheese. Everything was amazing! It had a great vibe and I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Extremely impressed!  I can't bring myself to call these guys bartenders, they are true mixologists. Ours had expert knowledge on how the drinks would taste (without being a pretentious jerk). We watched him straw-tasted every drink and if necessary, make adjustments if it was not right.   Drinks were also STRONG! I had the Lime and the Coconut and had a pretty solid buzz halfway in. I also had the Whiskey Berry Jubilee (I think?), and tasted  whole bunch of others from friends. The whiskey was very, very smooth and I'm not much of a whiskey drinker.  There are other reviewers that are not pleased with the prices-- this is definitely a \"treat yourself\" spot. I think the quality taste of the drinks is what makes it worth every penny.  I also got to taste the pot pie and the Seoul fried chicken-- both delicious.  The only feedback I have is that the menu is kind of complicated and overwhelming at first. The matrix in the back is pretty helpful for those that are not sitting at the bar, but maybe color tabs would be helpful to go with the color coding.  (If you sit at the bar, the mixologists are very good at gauging your tastes by asking you about a few preferences, so it helps take out the guess work)."}
{"text":"Was referred by a ton of people to me, oh my gosh AMAZING !!! Drinks were BOMB , service awesome , building was had a ton of Arizona history ... You have to try it"}
{"text":"Bitter & Twisted has officially declared its secession from the United States, and the world as we know it, because the impolite doorman refused to acknowledge an unexpired U.S. passport as legal identification, something no other country, including the United States, does. Two stars for flawless previous visits before the secession."}
{"text":"I think that this is the best bar that I have been to EVER and that's saying a lot because I've been to plenty. The bartenders were so friendly and made drinks as an art verse a job. I would definitely recommend !!"}
{"text":"I love this place for the look and the drinks we ordered that were perfect. My issue is the reservation \"needed\" thing and no standing not being explained to anyone in my party. Really need to explain that to people and a simple sorry would of been nice.  Will be back again to try sitting at the bar."}
{"text":"Stop what you're doing and come eat these chips!!! Never thought I would love a potato chip so much, but Wow! This place is so cool, good ambiance, friendly service and an impressive selection of drinks. The pineapple caipirinha was deliciously made. Pork belly is so good and the chips are just heavenly!!!"}
{"text":"Never have I been treated with more disrespect than I have at this over pretentious place.  We stopped there last night for cocktails after a show, proceeded to spend a significant amount of money and have a good time, at no point getting out of control.  The instant I go to slide out of the booth and a buddy goes to step over to move into the booth, this asshat of a asst.mgr. named John comes up and takes the drink out his hand and tells us we have to leave.   Then he proceeds to figure the bill and overcharge us to the tune of a couple hundred dollars.  As we are leaving the doorman, who is friends with several in our group as they frequent this place regularly, is shocked to see us leaving so soon.  When the situation is explained to the doorman and hostess, they both roll their eyes and comment that \"yes, John is an ass, we are sorry he did that\".   I eat out 5-6 times a week and enjoy the weekends at the various 4-5 star establishments across the valley spending thousands on a regular basis, and I will never return to this place because of this one individual.   Drinks were great, food was good, service was horrible.  Hopefully the real management reads this review and addresses John's attitude and overcharging.  Downtown has many great options and this is no longer one of them.  Bitter & Twisted is a suitable name as that is exactly how I feel about this place.   Well done John, if that's what you were going for, you succeeded."}
{"text":"This is exactly the kind of cocktail lounge that people who know nothing about cocktails or lounges would find appealing. I mean, what's not to love? The tired menu choices? The waaaay too thumpy disco bass pounding in your ears as if you were at a lame nightclub in Soho? This place is far too noisy to enjoy a conversation. The meat and cheese plate looked excellent in the pictures. When it arrived at the table, it was bologna and table grapes. Somebody had a great idea they didn't know how to execute. Good potential - but quite an unsatisfying performance."}
{"text":"Nicolette is the most amazing waitress on the planet.  Expect nothing but excellence!"}
{"text":"We had a fabulous time! The atmosphere was awesome and the music was upbeat. But what was even more great was the food!!!   There were 4 of us so we ordered the fish and chips, the Seoul fried chicken, the meat and cheese board, and yummy noodles with pork belly. Everything was DELICIOUS. We were so full but ordered the banoffee pot dessert anyway...very sweet so prepare yourself...we all just shared one and it was perfect for us.   They have a list of their most popular drinks so some of us ordered the lime and coconut cocktail....creamy and smooth, yummy. I ordered the rum \"McStormy\" which wasn't on the most popular list. WAY too strong. I ordered it thinking it would be sweet since it was a combo of ginger beer, coke and rum but all I could taste was straight rum. Perhaps I just had a heavy pourer or I am a lightweight. But I prefer drinks with a kick but without tasting like one. Our waitress removed it from the bill when she noticed I wasn't drinking it which was very kind and I didn't ask her to nor was I expecting it. Wonderful service.   We are vacationing in Scottsdale all the way from Bed Stuy in Brooklyn, NY. The next time we are in town we will be returning."}
{"text":"My second time there tonight and I brought three friends who had never been.  They don't allow standing anywhere at the bar, but they also do not take reservations, so I downloaded the NoWait app at the suggestion of their website.  Kind of a cool app, for restaurants that don't take reservations but it turns out that in the time it took to get there and park, they had given our table away.  Luckily, they had an available table and we were seated right away.   Their drink menu this time around is much more intense than when I was there 8 months ago but thank goodness for their Top 10 list.  We ordered off of that and did well the entire night with our choices.  Our drinks were all delicious, and we tried at least 2 each.  The food menu offers a limited selection but what we had was tasty.  Between the four of us we shared the typhoon chicken, the shortrib tacos and the potatoes.  We enjoyed all 3 dishes.  There wasn't much more on the menu that looked appealing.  Our server was good but did get a little backed-up toward the later part of our time there.  I'll probably be back for their cocktails but likely after I've had dinner elsewhere."}
{"text":"Excellent cocktails. Everything was great until our second round- no water or drinks for about 20 minutes. However, manager was great and took care of the second round for our inconvenience. We will be back."}
{"text":"This place is a joke!!  The booze selection is limited at best!!!  And the bartenders have no imagination. They are impersonal and inattentive. I think they learned how to make drinks at Red Lobster!!!"}
{"text":"So I was in Phoenix for a conference, and after all the conferencing was done I went for a wander in the downtown area. I figured there would be some interesting place to go and get an after work pint. I stumbled upon this place pretty quickly. It's hard to describe the aesthetic of this place, but if you look up the following places in Vancouver, you'll get the idea. It had the look of a Donnelly Pub, the attention to detail of The Pourhouse, and the friendly service of the Black Frog. What I'm trying to say is, this place is great for an afterwork drink or a nice evening out. There is an extensive cocktail list, a good selection of beer, and a compact menu of food that pairs nicely with beer and cocktails. I recommend the Korean Fried Chicken.   Also, bonus point for having lots of electrical outlets underneath the bar."}
{"text":"The only place in town for a real craft cocktail prepared right before your eyes. Lots of quality ingredients...fresh herbs, fresh fruit. Just go. You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"We had a great experience! I had the Lime & Coconut (on their top ten list) but switched out the tequila for vodka...super delish...hubby had an old fashioned & enjoyed it thoroughly. We had the yum yum noodles with pork, grilled bread with pate & a salad...every bite was delicious! We also had one of the specialty cupcakes, which was good. The only suggestion I can make is that they need to serve coffee...I would suggest French press, because it would go well with the ambience of Bitter & Twisted! I enjoyed the interiors & the service was very good. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I thought Bitter and Twisted was referring to the drinks, but apparently it's referring to the bitter staff and disappointing food options. Our experience started out okay - the atmosphere is cool and we ordered Mac and cheese, cheese bites and salad.  We were hoping to see a few healthy options or a bit more variety on the menu. Our drinks and Mac and cheese came within a reasonable amount of time and everything was pretty good. Unfortunately, our server was pretty unfriendly and failed to check back in with us. Our drinks were empty for at least 15 minutes and our salad never showed up. A second server put in our salad finally, but when it came out we could only eat two bites, it was terrible. Again our drinks ended up being empty for a long time, then when we got our check, she had to ask us what we ordered.  If you're just looking for a drink, but aren't that thirsty, it would be a good place to hang out."}
{"text":"I love this  place! Can't get enough. The pâté is,the best thing I've ever put in my mouth. Decor and ambiance are awesome, both dining room and bar. The staff are friendly, knowledgeable and a treat for the eyes. Nice job BnT! I think I need to go there now..."}
{"text":"Was specifically invited to the pre-opening tonight. Was told by two separate individuals that they were at capacity and could not allow us in. After mentioning the invite we were given keys with no explanation of what to do. Once a waitress appeared (30 minutes later) I asked about the complimentary \"punch\" and bar food sampling we supposed to be trying. She said \"we're not doing that tonight\". We placed our orders which NEVER arrived. We asked the hostess later what the keys were for and were told we were supposed to give to the bartender for free cocktails. WTF kind of circus is this bar? Simply put, there will never be a recommendation given for this establishment."}
{"text":"The vibe here is absolutely chill! The music added to it perfectly, and if you're like me, you enjoy great music in the background with your drink! The music was loud, but not enough to drown out your conversation or scream your order at the bartender! I was torn between the Lovefruit Medley, Lime and the Coconut, and the Slap 'n Tickle (I think that's what it was). The bartender gave me his honest opinion of the three which helped me pick the Lovefruit. I WILL be going back for those other two drinks! I also had the Elote Locos (crazy corn) to snack on which was part of their \"deal menu\" if you will. It was the best thing EVER!! If you've ever had corn in a cup with the fixings, I strongly recommend this one for you! It was overall an awesome experience for my first time!"}
{"text":"This IS the best motherfuckin' bar in Phoenix!! And Brian is the best MF'in bartender. Good times, great drinks, and amazing service!!!!"}
{"text":"The drinks, food and atmospheric are amazing. The drinks are unique favorites all fresh with just the right touches. The food is also fresh and a twist with each dish. Must try the hurricane popcorn, the souel chicken to start and then keep moving through the entrees. Awesome place and highly recommend!"}
{"text":"It is unacceptable to find (in this day and age) a place were customers are nice and down to earth, the service is amazing and bartenders get to know you like old friends.  They have an ungodly long drink menu with delicious drink that will suit any palette and their food is right sized and right priced.  I feel disgusted they make me feel good after a bad day ...  See you next week!"}
{"text":"I went to Bitter & Twisted Last night and was welcomed by Summer, Norah, and Virionna to the location. The cocktails on the menu were unique and very fun, and when tasted proved to be as delicious as the description suggested, served with a flair & saucy attitude by Piroose one of the best bartenders I have encountered. Keith behind the bar was also very friendly. All in all I can't wait to come back and taste the remaining drinks on the menu."}
{"text":"Finally a bar that makes you talk with people you came with.! Delicious cocktails, yummy food and no random sports talk. Thank you"}
{"text":"I had a great time at my first visit to this classy cocktail bar.  It starts with the menu, which is like a short novel.  Don't be overwhelmed: the bartenders and waitresses are happy to guide you to the perfect concoction and if in doubt, there's a map in the back of the book...er, menu.  I liked the menu, it was a lot of fun to peruse.  The drinks are expertly made with fresh ingredients, most of which they make themselves on the days they're closed.  If you want something off the menu, they're happy to create something just for you.  I can't remember the names of drinks at the moment, but mine had tequila and coconut, which was good.  The fruity/creamy drink Amy got was even better.    Prices are high, but the drinks are excellent.  This is a \"hang out and enjoy a couple drinks with friends\" kind of place, not a \"get wasted and forget all your woes\" kind of place.    They highlight bad Yelp reviews.  I think that's funny.  The bill is kept on a tablet, and credit cards processed the same way! It saves time and paper (probably) but let's be honest, it's just cool."}
{"text":"The brisket street tacos were small but yummy! Tried a spicy margarita that was also delicious. Unfortunately my husband was looking for a hefty meal which was not offered here! I would recommend this place for the hipster and those that enjoy crafty cocktails!"}
{"text":"My somewhat large group (about 10) came to Bitter and Twisted last night to celebrate a birthday. At first I was blown away by the interior and ambiance of B&T, it was gorgeous,  dark, and in the Luhrs building,  which I love. The cocktail menu was huge with so many different options and the bartenders were very showy. The three stars is because of the staff. Our waitress had a bad attitude the second we got in our seats and the bus boys continually attempted to remove our only half gone drinks to the point where we had to tell them to stop removing them all together.  TL;DR - amazing ambiance and menu, incredibly shitty service."}
{"text":"YUM YUM YUM! Was here for a work happy hour and the service, drinks and small bites were on point! Can't wait to bring my out of town company for a visit!"}
{"text":"I love the drinks but oh my god the service,mostly the security is the worst!!!!!!!!!  If your not white please  prepare for being  scrutinized and rejected. Complete bs and so sad how \"scared\" the big o'l security guards are. Ha! Way to go Phoenix for being soo \"inclusive and growing \" Just sad I'll miss the aviations :("}
{"text":"If Maverick wanted a cocktail in Phoenix he'd seek out Tim at B&T. The best of the best (although Jax at Clever Koi is running a close second). This is a big boy bar with real folk cocktails.  Ask for the Big Red One - off menu and a truly patriotic experience. This is the type of cocktail lounge born of real cities.  Phoenix, welcome to your champion."}
{"text":"I drove for half an hour to get here then paid for 2 hours of parking to find out it was closed for a private event. At this point it could be the last place in phoenix with food and I'd rather starve to death than come back. Nobody wants to check your website to see if you made an event. That's why your hours are posted on yelp."}
{"text":"Best bar in Phoenix! The bar tender last night was seriously awesome. These guys are legitimate bar tenders; you don't find that around these parts of town very often. Their drinks are out of this world!! I highly encourage you to sit at the bad when you're in, especially on a weekend!"}
{"text":"I have never given a low rating before but the service we experienced was atrocious. We had a party of 8 and all ordered drinks and appetizers which were really good. However we had 1 more friend joining our party and were interrupted by the manager letting us know that our friend could not join our party due to occupancy. They wouldn't even let her inside despite the fact that there were open tables and seats at the bar. My girlfriend cancelled her order to go tend to her friend who was not allowed in the building. the manager continued to plead her case about occupancy/standing rules and then I eventually followed and canceled my order. I will never go back to this place and do not recommend it to anybody unless management changes."}
{"text":"The best drinks, the best presentation, excellent service and a expansive drink menu. All an alcoholic could ask for!"}
{"text":"We loved this place!!!  We just happened into it with a few hours to kill before a flight and what serendipity!  The staff was very knowledgeable and helpful in great recommendations and the cocktails and food are well above Phoenix standard!  We are at every good restaurant on the list the last 5 days - and this place goes to number 1 in our book!!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I visited right before I moved to AZ. This is a great place. Its got a great location (close to sporting events and concert venues) and yet even on a Thursday wasn't very packed and we got great service at the bar.  The cocktails on the menu are mainly fruity in flavor but when my friend asked for something a little more \"manly\" he got a great custom bourbon cocktail made right there on the spot!   Suggestion though, according to the bartender, when there is a huge crowd expected because of some sort of event...they only serve about three of their cocktails and a few beers. Better to visit when fewer people are in town."}
{"text":"Kinda snobby feel.. bouncer has a robot like stance with no trace of personality.. we almost left after just being carded..too many places to get drinks downtown to deal with that.. food was great!. Drinks are super fancy but kinda gross...like a Ferrari with a flat tire... Pretty to look at but not fun to drive... Waitresses are nice! Waited months to try this place.. unfortunately, we probably won't be back.."}
{"text":"Loved this place!! Service was great and drinks were good.   Stopped in because one of the waitresses from down the street said it was suppose to be one of heh best bars in Phoenix and if they played a little more hip hop it just may be!"}
{"text":"This place is one of a kind. We had a few issues like slow service (their computer system was down) and  a burned burger (no excuse there), but even with that I would go back if I were local. The atmosphere is cozy, the food (besides the badly burned burger) was tasty and beautifully presented, and the drink selection is original and bountiful. Their drink menu is so original. I would have given this place five stars were it not for their bad judgment to put that gross, burned burger on the table. Needless to say, they did not charge for the burger nor for the dish I chose to replace it and they apologized profusely."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant for the cocktail menu and the ramen burger! YUM!"}
{"text":"Yelp should create negative stars just for this place. So once again we attempted to go here and once again the seating policy made us walk away in disgust. This time the door nazi asked us if we \"we're on the list\". We ran into another group of potential customers outside who were just as disgusted with the business as we were. Heads up Bitter & Twisted, if you have multiple customers outside speaking negatively about your establishment, and you have a 66% failure rate with our attempts to spend money at your place in the past year and a half, you are not doing well with public opinion. Let me also mention that upon arriving, we opened door, as you would upon entering any business, and we were basically pushed out and told to wait outside. Never again will we attempt to throw away our money at this egocentric establishment."}
{"text":"I travel for a living and eat at the best restaurants in America.  Bitter & Twisted is a contemporary \"twist\" on the classic speakeasy cocktail bar (\"twist\" - see what I did there?!?!). Anyway, the bartenders are ridiculously talented and entertaining.  If you can't decide on a cocktail from their huge menu, just tell them what you like.  Try the bread, mac & cheese (with bacon) and the ramen burger. If you go on a Tuesday, indulge on a High Spirited Cupcake!    P.S Angi W has no friggin' clue or pallete... stick to fast food girl!"}
{"text":"Excellent all around, Food, Service and drinks. The bartenders know what they are doing, seriously! Rock on Bitter and Twisted., keep on doing it right."}
{"text":"Was in town for an event and this place was luckily within walking distance from the hotel we were staying at. I absolutely loved there menu, theme, and the selection of drinks they offered. The food they offered looked really good but we came in around midnight and wasn't looking to eat! The two drinks we had were excellent and I wish I remembered what they were called! I love that this place uses premium spirits and fresh juices in there drinks as it makes for a better cocktail in my opinion. The bartender we had made very good drinks for us and was super friendly  I really wish they were out here in California as this we be a regular go to spot for me! Can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"Drinks are good, a lot of options if you are a real connoisseur, but the menus and tablet ordering system are really inefficient and confusing. The service is also bad - we had the same waitress both times we were here and couldn't believe she still had a job after over a year between visits! So rude."}
{"text":"I don't know how people hate on this place. Great drinks and the dragon dumpling burger is the best thing I've ever put in my mouth, don't tell my husband ;)"}
{"text":"This place was so much fun to just chat and have a few drinks with my girls! There is so many options, I can't wait to go back. Everything was delicious and the staff was amazing."}
{"text":"Hand crafted drinks, yes please. I had the lemongrass and the porn star. Yes, both were perfect well balanced the lemongrass was tall and refreshing. The porn star had a piece of passion fruit in it, making it flavorful and exotic.   My sister had the lime on the coconut, I had a sip, ooohhhh weeeee, nice and creamy. It's topped with super whipped egg whites. True magic tastes just like vacation.   The place was cool with music playing in the background, not loud just right, comfy booths and couches, totally dig the giant poster of the 50 foot woman. Sexy."}
{"text":"Love the location, charm of the building, front dorr greetings & the drinks. Oh my the drinks are top drawer. Loved the menu. Sadly we only tried one cocktail each as we were on our way home & just wanted to give this place a shot. We'll have to come back & make a date night out of it very soon. But be prepared to wait patiently as your patience will be rewarded with a cleverly crafted cocktail. Also be prepared to pay for what you get. The prices aren't for someone looking for a happy hour cheap vodka cran but you get what you pay for. So drink better & enjoy."}
{"text":"Second time here and was super excited to bring my husband! Unfortunately the service was substandard. We have three different people come by and asked for a cup of ice three times. We ordered the nachos and the yum yum noodles. The nachos with brisket were tasty but very spicy with jalapeños all over the top and throughout to the point I couldn't finish it. The noodles I would get again. Then we finish and they run your card at the table and stand over you while u complete the transaction in front of them with a 20% tip box already checked! It will be a long time till we return."}
{"text":"The venu is very cool we loved it. The drinks were good but the waitress was lousy. I really liked the meat and cheese board and popcorn."}
{"text":"We stopped by for a cocktail since we heard so much about this place. We were not disappointed. We ordered the High Society and the thrifty cocktail of the day which featured chamomile and was served in a tea cup. Dark rum, maple, cinnamon, and lime were highlighted in the High Society drink and it was one of the best drinks I've ever had. I will definitely be back to order this drink again and to order something else off of their extensive drink menu. I liked the atmosphere and the bartenders were very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for an appetizer and drinks this weekend. Of note-Comicon was in town. This could have been the cause of it being extremely busy and service slow. The drink menu was awesome but definitely intimidating. There were SO many choices and lots to read before you knew all the options. The drinks were large and average priced-I prefer smaller cocktails-so I can try a few and be more adventurous in my choices. My husband and I both got one drink and a meat/cheese board. The board came out before the drinks (again this place was busy) but the drinks followed shortly after. I wasn't overly impressed with either the food or the drinks. I'm not saying it wasn't good but I've had better. I enjoyed the atmosphere and people watching. I think we would come back on a not so busy day to try things again."}
{"text":"This bar secretly has some of the best food in town. Creative Asian fusion that's out of this world. Screw your dinner plans, save your appetite for the bar."}
{"text":"The drinks here are sooo good. The menu is a little overwhelming (over 70 options) but the last page has a top 10 list to help you choose for the first time. The bartenders are friendly and I love the snarky messages on the board! I haven't ordered much food but the Korean tacos are delicious."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar. Our bartender was fantastic and entertaining. Had the Ramen Momo Burger and Green Chili Mac... OMFG!! So damn good! Only bad thing: I had to share with my husband. Would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Love this place! The entire staff is always so welcoming. The service, food, and drinks are amazing. Every drink is hand crafted and unique. I have yet to find my go-to favorite since everything is delicious. GET A BATH TUB PUNCH!"}
{"text":"The bar tenders are the highlight here. Every time I'm here I'm blown away at their pace and execution. This time around I got a Vesper, drink made famous by the Ian Fleming novel Casino Royal. It was second to the stories and perfect drink breakdown by the bar tender. A most if you're looking for a cocktail in Phoenix. No other place tops it.   My bar tender was Scottish. He's the only with an accent, don't ask him if he's English... You might get stabbed.   Jerry springer final thoughts: cocktails great, bar tenders great, very stabby if you don't know your British accents :)"}
{"text":"The Manhattan deserves a million stars!!! I have yet to try a Manhattan here in town that comes close to B&T's masterpiece. Try it. Now.  I'm surprised at how many cocktail options are on the menu. I know it's a cocktail parlor, but it was overwhelming. Their signature drinks are interesting, but it's the classic cocktails that I think they make the best.   Ambiance - The area by the bar is super cool, try to score a table there. The dining room seems to be confused about the style it is trying to be. The decor in my opinion, is too contemporary for the historic building.   Service - great service every time.  Price - on the high side, but order a Manhattan and you're golden ;-) Very strong!  Food - the fries chicken with watermelon kimchi is bomb! Oh, and the popcorn is super delish."}
{"text":"This is a fun, delicious place to spend an evening (or in my case, an afternoon). I slipped in shortly after opening to beat the heat and do something other than hang out at my hotel, and it was a great experience. They check your ID at the door and pull back the (actual) curtain to let you in, playing up the whole speakeasy vibe. Then you're inside the historic building to cozy up to the bar and try one of the many amazing cocktails. I began with a Vieux Carré at the recommendation of the bartender, as I told him I loved Manhattans. The drink did not disappoint. I also did a Dr. Reyes, Dr. Reyes, which packed a spicy punch. Highly recommended!   This place was cool. If I move to Phoenix, I will definitely come downtown for it.  Update: WHEN I move to Phoenix, I will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"What a creative and wonderful cocktail bar! We loved the theme menus and the atmosphere of this bar. The staff were great and helped us pick the perfect cocktails for the evening. The vibe is old speakeasy but with a fun twist. Big variety of drinks offered as well. I was just visiting PHX but next time I'm in town I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"What a great find!  We had seen this place on an earlier trip to Phoenix and just never had the time to check it out.  After an NBA game at the Arena we decided to stop in here for a drink and some snacks.  It seemed like everyone else around had the same thought because the place was packed.  We put our name down for a table and were quoted a 45 minute wait.  About 20 minutes later we were called back, awesome!  We proceeded to spend over an hour enjoying the great cocktails Bitter & Twisted had to offer.  We tried a couple of their mules and I loved that they served them in the cans of Goslings.  For food we tried the pork belly and paired it with their grilled cheese, delicious!  We had a great time and our server was fantastic, making sure we never ran out of anything.  Our bill was brought in a hollowed out 'book' and when we were ready to pay she was able to run the card at our table.  I love those little details, can't wait to be back."}
{"text":"This is A historic land mark. It's a lot like stepping back in time. It's like stepping into the heart of Chicago.   The food. The drinks. Absolutely heaven.  The bar tenders really knew what they were doing.  I plan on returning very soon.  Highly recommended.  Lunch or Dinner."}
{"text":"Hit up Bitter Twisted yesterday before a Dbacks  game and it was real cool. The cocktail menu is literally a book!! Then they have a small appetizer type menu. Surprisingly we got there early enough and walked right in for a table. All of us got a different cocktail and i took the pictures below. Cocktails run 9-15$ each depending on what you get. This would be a great 1st date place, although could be pricey if your drink $15 each drinks.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Nice location and building.  Service stinks, servers are unhappy and slow movers.  Female floor supervisor/manager, just as sad and sorry.  There is no way servers can offer good service when they are unhappy.  Food is ok, nothing to tell others about."}
{"text":"Amaze-balls! Awesome cocktails and I could spend hours looking at their cocktail menu!!! Will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best places for craft cocktails. Making drinks here isn't the typical quick pour but a calculated combination of flavors. From vintage drinks, re-imagined favorites, or new concoctions Bitter and Twister can tailor any drink to your taste buds. The food is a limited menu but delicious and complimentary to the drinks.  Tips: * Make reservations as this popular venue can be rather busy. * Don't be afraid to ask for advice. The mixologists on hand will have recommendations to satisfy your drink of choice."}
{"text":"Drinks are great but there are sooo many to choose from it's almost impossible. The place has a very speakeasy vibe that I loved. You do have to wait to get in though so plan ahead"}
{"text":"I don't have anything good to say. I just know I won't ever go back. Service goes a long way in getting customers. I go to a lot of restaurants /bars & take lots of people with me. None of whom will be going to B&T."}
{"text":"Not many places can make a Ramos Gin fizz that rocks, let alone a side car with Pierre Ferrand 1840.  Great place for cocktails!"}
{"text":"I'm still TRYING to try this place. I went a month or two ago and the whole bar was reserved for a private party, then I went last week and they wouldn't let us in until room opened up at the bar or a table. Guess I'll never know how good the food or drinks are."}
{"text":"OMG This place is CRAZY good. This was our first time here, and sure as hell won't be our last. Great food, friendly service, and excellent vibe. Put this on you \"MUST TRY\" list !"}
{"text":"I love seeing downtown come around. I went to this place on a Thursday around 7pm and plenty of seats were free.  Drinks are great and the food was excellent.  I would have given this 5 stars but our server was not the best."}
{"text":"Spend your hard-earned money, time and joyment and don't miss this place at all costs."}
{"text":"Mmmm omg the ramen burger was really good, a little pricey but worth it... Cool place too for drinks and good time, I would go back"}
{"text":"First off, sit at the bar. Introduce yourself to a bartender and make yourself comfortable. The menu can be overwhelming, but the bartenders will walk you through it and answer any questions you might have. Like tequila? They have a drink for that. What about gin? They have a recommendation for that, too. Even if you don't know what you want, they will have something you will enjoy. Just look above the bar for a seemingly endless selection of spirits. They also have a nice wine and beer list on the wall. If you like cocktails, you will love this place. It's nothing fancy, but it doesn't have to be for people to enjoy it. The drinks are reasonably priced, too. Oh, and they list a \"Yelper of the week\" on the menu. I hope I make the cut! To Bitter and Twisted, cheers."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend and 2 other friends. The drink menu is amazing and your instantly impressed. Then you experience the slowest, rudest service you have ever had and she brings you the wrong drink. Makes you feel like it's your fault and doesn't return with a new one for 20 minutes. Well all of our people had already finished theirs so we declined the replacement. Definitely not what I had expected, don't think I would recommend it to anyone either. I am still a little shocked at the attitude given by our server."}
{"text":"Wife and I were able to go here last night.  usually my days off line up with the two days they are closed.  The drink menu was overwhelming, luckily the last page has a Top 10 drink listing.  we tried # 3 and #4 on the top 10 list and both drinks were excellent.  The last drink we tried was Ship load of rum, and that was another great drink. We were sitting at the bar so we got to watch the bartender make all the drinks, what a great show and he was more than happy to explain the drinks he was making and answer any questions.  Will definitely come back again"}
{"text":"If you haven't been here yet, put it on your list.  This converted warehouse has an amazing ambiance and character.  The food and drinks are amazing!  You will have fun exploring the fairytale themed drink menus and ordering random shots from the bar.  The Momo is a must try but then again, so is everything else.  Staff is great too!"}
{"text":"I'm only giving this place 1 star cause I could give it a zero. Don't waste your time or money here"}
{"text":"My dad is old. Needed to use restroom badly. I understand it's a zoo out here during Superbowl weekend but really? Sucks because we ate here and they were friendly but the hostess on Saturday night was pretty mean about it. 1st they couldn't let him in to use the restroom, when I politely asked because he's old, NOT ME OR ANYONE ELSE JUST HIM,  she proceeded to allow him to use the restroom for $10 cover charge! Customer service down the drain.  Out of town elderly can use restrooms here for $10.  Bitter lost a family as customers tonight."}
{"text":"We were delighted to join friends last night for a first anniversary soiree at this venue! Ambiance was an old schoo parlourl and lovely! Small plate of brisket tacos was delicious! Top ten drinks were a terrific start to the evening...I tried the lemon grass cocktail and was not disappointed!"}
{"text":"Worth the wait, but next time I will use their app and put myself on the waitlist before going.  It took over an hour for 2 of us to get a table (just for drinks).  Their drink menu is so cool!  And very extensive too.  Drinks were pretty good.  I had the rosa negroni, tasted like a regular negroni, but still good.  I also had a cachaca drink with berries and that was pretty good as well.  Lively atmosphere and music.  I would come here often if it wasn't for the drive and parking."}
{"text":"Don't worry about the \"YELPER OF THE WEEK\" (photo)... Great spot! Want something you can't get at every other place in Phoenix? Come Here."}
{"text":"I would give more stars but apparently you need a reservation. .... For a bar...  That's right. Reservations for a bar. There's no standing allowed at a bar. So we went to BlueHound instead. I highly recommend BlueHound though."}
{"text":"Whenever I come back in town, I am definitely coming back here. My friend and I came here and the people from the staff to customers were so friendly and talkative. I would come here often if I lived here. This place has a great atmosphere and vibe. Our bartender, \"Carous\" forgive me if I spelled it wrong, was cool to talk to and we met some more cool people throughout the night. This is one of the best bars I've gone to in the area. As far as drinks, I got the love fruit medley and it was delish--fruit might get stuck in your straw tho so don't look dumb. :)"}
{"text":"The best drinks you can get downtown. Period. You can't make a reservation, but you can hop on the nowait app wait list! It's actually a lot easier than you think, and if you get on early enough it won't be that hard for you to get a table when you want it. Also every time you text back on nowait they actually see it so don't just randomly say something stupid like \"fuck off.\" DO communicate your needs and delays and I promise you will have a good time!  Some of the most talented bartenders in the county work at this bar, however if you are seated with a server... trust them, they know their stuff! They are extremely well educated and vetted! They have to beor they can't work there- take suggestions and enjoy the ride!"}
{"text":"Such a great casual place in downtown Phoenix! A few of us went out on Friday evening to grab some food and drinks. We were seated immediately upon arrival & our waitress came by to grab our order. The drink list was quite extensive and they had a few specials on their happy hour list.  I ended up selecting the Thrifty Cocktail which was a fruity concoction with citrus fruits, tasty & not super sweet. It was a good choice which I enjoyed! My husband got the L.I.T Up which was a Long Island inspired cocktail; he was a bit skeptical about it when it arrived since it was served in a little Coca Cola can but he really enjoyed it.  We had gotten a couple of Favorites from the menu to start - Pork Belly Buns & Korean Nachos. The clear winner here was the Nachos, we were all contemplating getting a second order. The brisket was tender & super flavorful, went really well with the cheese sauce & crema. It had a bit of spice too with the jalapeños! We will be getting these every time we come here.  For dinner, my husband got the Lucky Eight (which was Picked Fried Ribs) and I got the Chish & Fips. Our friends got the Ramen Burger & Dumping Burger, they enjoyed them both although it seemed that the crispy ramen \"bun\" was maybe a little odd. This fish that I got was amazing though! It was fried perfectly, super crispy, and the double cooked chips were thick wedge cut. There was a big quantity of both but I really wanted to eat it all! The tartar sauce was really great too as a dipping sauce.  Overall, a really great experience. They have their Happy about from Tuesday - Friday from 4pm to 7pm. We were too full this time but will be saving room to try their High-Spirited Cupcake next time! We will be back."}
{"text":"Who knew bar popcorn could be so good? If I lived in Phoenix this would be a go to bar drinks and a light meal. The ambiance is fantastic and so calming after spending a long day at work. I went on a Thursday and it was easy to find seating for our large group.  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night with some friends. We all loved this place. Very extensive cocktail selection and fun atmosphere. Music was a bit loud but other than that we loved everything about it! My wife really loved the S'mores!"}
{"text":"Amazing! We wanted to check out this place for quite some time. We went around 8:30 on a Friday night and were greeted at the front door by the sweetest guy. He was wonderful and took our names and said it would be about a 30-40 minute wait. We got a text when the table was ready and headed in. The vibe was excellent. Everything about the decor, lighting was so perfectly put together. We sat down and waited for our server. She came to check on us pretty fast, despite how busy it was. We put in an order of their green chile Mac and toasted cheese bites. I got the lime and coconut drink and my girlfriend got a strawberry drink. The drinks came and they were absolutely phenomenal. It was one of the best drinks that I had. It was topped with this lime/coconut foam and it was just wonder. My girlfriend loved hers too. The green chile Mac came and it was 10/10. Just so creamy and flavorful. The grilled cheese bites were very good as well. We decided to order the smashed chips. They were okay. Not my favorite, but they were not too shabby. The Mac and cheese was just the bomb, it'd put most everything to shame. I then got the pornstar martini. Omg. It was phenomenal and beautiful. The server (we forgot her name) was absolutely great. She was attentive and very friendly. The guy at the front was so great too. We will definitely be back! This place did not disappoint"}
{"text":"I am happy to say this is a gem that should be treasured. Their philosophy on mixology, the art of the cocktail and attention to food is phenomenal. I was very apprehensive having been turned away from on another evening and it pains me to give them a 5 star rating; however that being said, I am glad to have given this establishment another chance. Worth the wait great cocktails great food great service."}
{"text":"This was such a fun place! I like how it's sit down only so it doesn't get too crowded! We only had to wait like 15 minutes to sit down on a Saturday night so that wasn't a big deal at all. We all got their version of a Long Island which was so fun they serve it in a Coke can! Also they have the good kind of ice (the little kind). We also split  dick bath drink which was super cool and it was served literally in a mini bath tub with little duckies in it! Love it! I want to go back and order the ramen burger! The only reason it lost a star was because its a little too fancy but that's their vibe and I can dig it! Will be back to try food."}
{"text":"This place looks great from the inside, and it has a unique menu. However, the service we received was completely rude and unacceptable. Our waitress (the woman with the skull tattoo on her arm) yelled at my friends, said she was cutting them off, and accused them of slurring their words, even though this was untrue and everyone had had only one drink. They had taken a few minutes to remember the name of the tequila they wanted and for some odd reason she mistook this for drunkenness- which she should be fired for, given she works in a bar and should know better. Everyone had been very polite to her, and this was a complete shock. We politely said okay, we will take our check then- and in response she flung the check down on our table angrily. When my friend told her, look- it is my birthday- and I don't appreciate being spoken to in this manner- the waitress obnoxiously responded \"do you want to speak to my manager?\" Which is a totally disgusting response when  someone who isn't drunk is telling you it's her birthday. Friend did end up speaking to the manager who said he would talk to this horrible waitress, but who knows. My advice: DO NOT GO HERE. TERRIBLE SERVICE and none of us (6 total) will ever be back."}
{"text":"So the board in the bar used to have a spot for the mean yelper of the week...   I can't knock it, so mean = the bad reviewers wouldn't know a great cocktail joint if it fell on them like Dorothy's house in the Wizard of Oz.   The atmosphere is both modern and classic at the same time. It pays homage to the Luhrs tower that contains it, and prohibition era swank.  The bartenders are skilled and engaging. The drink menu extensive and the food items creative.  Busy on the weekends, so be prepared. But take the leap and grab a beverage.  P.S. my friend thinks Zack is 'the bees knees'."}
{"text":"The staff was rude, the door man thinks he's in secret service or something. Our drinks were ehhh, mine was ok, my friend's was not. And our food was cold. Nothing special. It's just a bar with a trendy vide but poor execution."}
{"text":"tl;dr - lots of great cocktails to choose from, great tasting but a little overpriced food, and very helpful service staff.  My first experience with sit down cocktails was traumatizing, but I definitely enjoyed Bitter & Twisted. It's a great place to take a cozy group of 4 or less; maybe 6 for a special occasion or if you don't mind waiting.  The menu is super helpful for providing options for you - must be over 100 drinks at least. If you don't know what you want, you can tell the servers what kind of drink you want or something similar, and they can either point you towards a menu cocktail that fits the bill or custom make the drink as needed. A lot of options for spirits here, so I think you'll be set.   I like citrus, so I opted for both the Limoncetta and the Lemongrass Collins, one of their top 10 most popular. The first is great if you love that lemon flavor - because that's ALL you're getting! As for the lemongrass, while the glass is much taller with the ice, I definitely feel is more balanced and I can see why it's popular. Both are very refreshing if you're into that.  Can't vouch for my friends' quality of drinks, I just know one of them had absinthe.  As for the food, it's hit or miss for size but I wouldn't come here on an empty stomach. The brisket tacos are a fantastic appetizer but they won't fill you up - each taco is a size of a coaster. The Chips and Fish are a much better bang for your buck if you want food. Honestly I'd come having eaten already or get something quick afterwards.  I wish college towns offered more places like Bitter & Twisted. It's a nice chill place to socialize, the drinks are well made, and you probably won't get shit faced on cheap bud light."}
{"text":"Visited for date night & enjoyed the experience. This cocktail joint is super pricey, but the quality and service are superb. We had 4 drinks & an appetizer and spent over $70.  I ordered the Porn Star Martini, which was a great recommendation by our server. It was really sweet and strong!!    Appetizer -nachos. Very tasty, but not for people who dislike a good kick in the mouth. Spiiiiiicey!  The atmosphere is very romantic and relaxing.  Service was fantastic and the bathrooms were clean."}
{"text":"They serve crack disguised as popcorn and cocktails that have God's good juice on it."}
{"text":"Drinks are way underpriced for how delicious they are. The setting is casual, a little loud but perfect spot for late night drinks. Definitely ask for Tim. Bomb ass bartender. #drinkbetter"}
{"text":"This was our last stop of the evening on a bit of a pub crawl on a staycation that we were having.  We ended up at the bar... busy place and the bartenders were pretty attentive. We had pretty straight forward drink orders and there were no issues, which was good.   The decor and ambiance was nice... seems like a good place to hangout and make new friends...  However, we did order a noodle dish to nosh on while we were hanging out and I have to say... it wasn't that great, wasn't much sauce and it had reduced down too far so that it was sticky and a bit bitter. Wouldn't order it again...  I'd try the place again for the service and the ambiance... but since the food was substandard and there are so many other good places to eat in that area... I'd probably change venue for a meal."}
{"text":"As far as cocktails go, the knowledge of the staff here is second to none. As is the execution of said cocktails. Amazingly flavorful drinks - all you need to do is describe your particular preferences and the appropriate drink will be recommended. This will absolutely be a place that I will return to and frequent again in the future. Yes, I might be a little under the influence as I write this up. However, I cannot recommend this enough."}
{"text":"This place serves up the finest cocktails in the valley! The comic book themed menu has pages of beverages to choose from, so everyone's palette gets pleasured. You get what you pay for as far as quality AND quantity!!!!! Quality liquor and fresh ingredients. It's mixology at its finest!  Clean establishment. Excellent and friendly service.  Hey, don't hmmm and haaa over the Bathtub beverage...just order it you dirty bastard. It's tasty and great for groups of 3+!"}
{"text":"My experience at cocktail parlor is like a story from a wild and crazy time, the 90's.  Imagine two friends driving across country to see there favorite basketball player, Michael Jordan. Sure, the hype is huge but you must see it in person.   --Consequently, I've heard the hype had to try it.   Yet when they get there, they realize they have left the tickets at home.   Disregard the fact that my friend's birthday happened to be 31 days ago, and yes albeit the law may say 30 days but this is where it gets bad. The staff made us wait 15 minutes until they could find the manager to ask if she could come in. Not only did we wait longer than cancer to form, but the manager didn't even have the decency to come out and tell us that she isn't allowed. Instead he hid behind the curtains like a scared little weasel. Unacceptable. Poor business practices and poor leadership qualities."}
{"text":"Wow I gotta kick myself for not coming here all these years! I could seriously live here the rest of my days and be a happy man trying everything on their menu! Awesome loft space with great DJ spinning tunes and a very cordial (pun intended) staff. Highly recommend checking this place out and let your imagination run libation wild!"}
{"text":"Flew into Phoenix for friends 60th Bday and went straight to Bitter and Sweet after reading reviews and website. Made a reso for a specific time via website. It Said they would text me if something earlier opened but no resoS needed. Drove downtown. Paid for parking. Closed for private party!!! People: update your website or don't take reservations. So disappointed. 60th birthday surprise is now a bust. Thanks Bitter and Twisted. I sure feel bitter."}
{"text":"Loved the idea of the menu!!! Drinks were excellent. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Very cute decor, Extra friendly bartenders! Extremely long list of choices but the top 10 list helps narrow it down! Loved the playlist on Saturday around 5pm.. would come back again!"}
{"text":"Bad service, bad management, bad customer service. A group of friends and me went Saturday night and the waitress accused my friend of throwing popcorn at my other friend but she didn't throw popcorn. And the manager got involved stated they do not want to have a mess. The drinks are amazing but never going back because the workers are all terrible. The bouncer is racist. Gave one star for the drinks."}
{"text":"Ross the owner crafted our drinks with an uncompromising flair. There are specific times to arrive and get a seat at the bar where you can observe the bar artists hone their craft. Friendly and enjoying what they do. Gotta try it; you'll be back..."}
{"text":"I went to this place on three separate occasions and every time it was a disappointment.   First two times, I could not even get the table and last time I went hostess was so unprofessional and rude. When 5 of us walked in she was talking to her friends that were leaving and would not even pay attention to us for good 3 minutes. Let me say that when she finally acknowledge us, she was really rude.   We walked in, place was dead. There were two people at the bar and that was it. I wouldn't of mind staying if the whole entrance experience was a bit nicer but we decided to go elsewhere.   This place is really nice inside but I it is hard for me to go back for fourth time and experience the same service.   I do not understand why do some people think they have a right to be so rude in positions that they are in. No offence, I was a hostess once but never would I treat my clients like that.   Hopefully I am wrong about this place and it was just my bad luck to have this kind of expiriance 3 times in the row."}
{"text":"Breakdown:  liked the ambiance, cool vibe.  Pros:  Awesome drinks and small plates Cons: Steep prices with service being mehhh  I met up with some buddies before a concert and was seated pretty promptly.  Everything was overpriced but hey, it's downtown!  Still enjoyed the experience.  I got the bao buns.  They were good. A little too much hoisin sauce for me but i can taste salt a mile away lool.  Drinks: i ordered 2 vodka collins on happy hour ($6.50 each).  Tasted great but not much kick.  My biggest problem was the waitress charging my card 3 times, blaming it on wifi and then being completely indifferent to me when i showed her (via app) that i had been charged 3 times.  Girl.  You came to my table a total of 3 times.  Don't be rude.    Would i go back?  Yes....but not with that server"}
{"text":"Salad served with warm wilted lettuce. Tacos featured 4 small mediocre soft taco shells with cold brisket."}
{"text":"Let me just preface this by saying I worked as a server for four years, most recently being three years ago, so I understand how this industry works. That being said, I wish I could give this place zero stars.   Some coworkers and I decided to go out for some after-work drinks, and frankly, a great night was ruined by the horrendous service we received here. We made a reservation for ten people, trickled in as we all arrived individually form work and then INFORMED OUR WAITRESS THAT WE WOULD ALL BE ON SEPARATE CHECKS. She told us that was fine as long as nobody switched seats. Well, little did we know that meant your ass needed to be glued to that seat, no potty breaks and no wandering to the other side of the table for five minutes to say hi to anybody. Throughout the less than two hours we were there, everyone was ordering drinks and appetizers on \"his tab\" \"my tab\" etc. and the waitress was playing along like it was no problem until she dropped our one big fat $500 check off at the end and told us she would not only not split it but we could only use four different forms of payment to pay the tab. Did you really expect any of us to be happy about that?!  When we finally spoke with a manager, he told us that restaurant policy stated we couldn't split the check if we switched seats, and that he'd been \"watching us\" and claimed we had switched seats, when in fact, that was a big fat lie. He also tried to play it off like he was soooo accommodating when 12 showed up for a party of ten... like, thanks dude, we pulled up two extra chairs OURSELVES. Long story short, we were chased out of there and they threatened to call the cops, even though we paid our ENTIRE tab.   The cherry on top was that they charged 20% auto gratuity, which would have been illegal if they had split the checks as promised from the very beginning. Not only that, but our waitress was extremely rude and inattentive the entire time we were there!   The manager told us that he would have split our checks if we hadn't gotten upset about the check not being split in the first place (like we were promised it would be) and if we hadn't switched seats (which we didn't). But then he told me he couldn't split it due to \"restaurant policy\" but THEN decided he was willing to waive that for only me, not the rest of my party, because I was \"nice\" to him... yeah, right.  The customer service here is beyond poor, the drinks were mediocre and overpriced, and the waitress treated us terribly for no reason. Nobody was drunk and disorderly, we were clear with what we wanted and which tab it needed to be on, and that was AGREED UPON at the beginning, and the end result was threatening police involvement to the extent of taking a picture of my licence plate out front AFTER WE'D PAID THE TAB, INCLUDING THE 20% TIP THE WAITRESS DIDN'T DESERVE."}
{"text":"Every drink I've had here has been delicious and strong. The have so many creative and unique options, and I always love getting their Thrifty Cocktail at happy hour -- inexpensive and simple. Even their food is exceptionally tasty -- the Hurricane Popcorn and YumYum Noodles are crazy flavorful!  Unfortunately, the service here has been consistently bad. The servers are very, very slow and inattentive, and treat you like you're inconveniencing them by wanting to order. The last two times I was here, it took at least 15 minutes (way longer one of the times) before a server even stopped to great us and ask our drink order.  When I was here with a group recently and it was time to pay, we were paying separately and the server just announced each of our totals out loud and swiped our card on the iPad. No chance to review the bill, and pretty awkward to announce to the group how much each person is spending.  Anyway, I truly do love the cocktails and food here, and it's a very cool place to hang out. However the terrible service is very off-putting and definitely causes me to limit the amount of times I visit here. There are other places to get a great cocktail where the staff will treat you better."}
{"text":"Based on a couple of articles in Phoenix mag we decided to stop by for a drink and a bite to eat. The atmosphere of the place was nice and we ordered the meat and cheese platter and the pork belly along with an old fashioned and the happy hour special cocktail. Was very impressed with the food especially the meat and cheese tray so five stars for food. The cocktails were just ok and rated three stars in our book so an overall rating of four.  Will come back if anything for the food."}
{"text":"Super posh and equally expensive bar in downtown. Nothing I tried was to die for amazing, but everything was different and out of my comfort zone. I would definitely go back again and try some other crazy different cocktails. The server was more than friendly. When we left there was actually a line to go in.... I don't know if I would wait in line to go here, but I would go back."}
{"text":"Reason for visit: dinner before J-Cole show  Service: top notch  Cool points: fantastic lively ambience, excellent cocktails and yummy happy hour eats  Food: so this is one of our go-to places when we really want to start the night off right. It's in downtown Phoenix so from there, you're a hop, skip, jump away from all sorts of places to eat, drink and be merry. Hands-down, my favorite is the ramen burger....it is quite a treat and again, their drinks are extremely delicious and make you want to savor each bite. For this particular visit, however; I opted to try a new dish, the Korean BBQ and grits because I'm a sucker for grits. It was delicious but too spicy for my palette. The bf happily scarfed down the rest while I treated myself to a drink called Over the Rainbow    This is on the pricier side but worth it - they do have mixologists who can create almost anything you're looking for."}
{"text":"Honestly? I can't believe I came here and only ordered 1 cocktail. I didn't have much time to kill, but The Wibble was wonderful. Tasted like a raspberry lemonade...with GIN. Heck yes.  What blew me away mostly was the menu. I actually dished out $20 to buy a fresh copy of the menu to take home because it was so beautiful. Actually the most inventive, artistic, and wonderful menu I've ever held in my hands. Ugh. I almost cried.   I could probably spend all day in here. I definitely shouldn't, for many reasons, but I absolutely could. I need to go back. I MUST. It's so good. Please go. Have a drink for me."}
{"text":"We had a reservation for 730, were seated by 8, and the waitress didn't come by to take our drink order until 830. For $12 drinks and no draft beers you should at least get some decent service."}
{"text":"I came here as part of a larger group (11) and we had a reservation. It was great because everyone was able to find something they enjoyed, from the adventurous to the barely drink alcohol people.  The prices are on point with a craft cocktail bar, and the selection was insane. Overwhelming, actually, but I'm not great at making choices.  It's been a few weeks, so I can no longer remember the names of the drinks I had, but the cucumber one was extremely refreshing. I also had one that had \"violet\" flavors which was so interesting, I had to try! Both were excellent.   Service was amazing. Such a friendly and helpful server, I tried to add more on top of the automatically added gratuity, but she wouldn't accept it!   I would not hesitate to come back!"}
{"text":"Had a great pre Neil Diamond meal here. The popcorn was SO GOOD, the smashed chips were too spicy for me but my husband loved them. Fish and chips was outstanding. Fun cocktail menu and great Happy Hour prices. Be prepared for community tables since there are few tables for just two. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"We love this place. The drinks are great! Also best Mac and Cheese. Unfortunately, the manager reprimanded the bouncer for being on his phone when he had just been head-butted by a guest and was calling the police. I felt so bad for the bouncer and thought the manager was unprofessional."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time last night with a friend and I will definitely be back. The lighting is low and there's a sexy feel about the place.   The variety of cocktails to choose from are plentiful. My favorite of the night was Apple of My Eye.   Even more note worthy than the cocktails is the food. I had green chili Mac n Cheese...trust me you need to try this! My friend had the ramen burger and it was delicious!  I'm so happy I took a chance and tried this place out because I was pleasantly surprised. This may become one of my go-to spots.   Major shout out to Brian the bartender, he's awesome!"}
{"text":"A gastronomical experience with a variety of flavors and textures. The drink menu was a wonderland of choices and concoctions. We started off with the Solero and Lime and the Coconut and ended with Slap N Tickle and Born Tequila. These flavors are not for the faint of heart, especially the Born Tequila, if you don't like spicy, don't get that one. It will definitely warm the heart and the hole tomorrow... The good news is, for foofie drinks, they actually give you alcohol. For the food, we started off with a meat and cheese platter which was most excellent and then went on to the Asian Buffalo Shrimp and Grits and finished off with the Smoked Brisket tacos. There was plenty of tasty food for the both of us. To summarize, we are very glad we stopped here to try this restaurant we had not been to before. Highly recommend visiting if you are in the area. It is a risky concept but it seems to work well."}
{"text":"Best cocktails in the valley!! This review is long overdue. I've been going here for years and it's great. The bartenders are phenomenal. If you're overwhelmed by the menu you can just tell them what kind of drink you want and they'll give you something incredible!  The service is great overall. I will confess, I slipped and fell the last time we were there and they were so considerate it just made me love the place more.  The food is delicious and a worthwhile endeavor. Especially the ramen burger.  The wait does get long sometimes, but it's worth it. Or you can just go a little early!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite foodie friends and I came here one night for some cocktails and to enjoy a girls night out... Mission.  Accomplished.   First, I was a frazzled mess trying to get downtown in rush hour traffic and driving around in circles to find parking because basically... I am a workaholic and can't seem to leave the office at a decent time to save my life.   Anyways...  Once I finally arrived,  our server was quick to come to the table and take my drink order.  I can't remember exactly what I ordered but it was 1/2 mango and a 1/2 a bit of liquid heaven in a glass.    We ended up ordering the pork belly buns (pork belly- delicious and the buns - gooey goodness), the Yum Yum noodles (speaks for themselves), and the dumpling burger which was OUT.STANDING.  Bitter and Twisted is a sexy little hangout which would be perfect for a date night or a girls night out.     It is definitely a place I would go back to time and time again!      Especially now that I know where to park."}
{"text":"Downtown after-work kind of place.We stopped in before the comedy club, and the cocktails were definitely the hit that evening.  Large space, areas for groups, high ceilings & hard surfaces make it a bit noisy.  A bit more on the vibrant and alive side of things than a dark & quiet 'speak-easy' establishment. No lack of options from the bar. Highly recommend.  One Yelpster quote of the day stated, that the drinks were over-priced. These are cocktails, not 'mixed drinks'. Anyone without DTs can pour thing 1 into a glass of thing 2. Few folks have been as able to take a recipe from my phone and kill it like these folks. IF you know the difference this place is well worth it. Cheers"}
{"text":"Very very rude hostesses. We asked to sit at the bar, where there were multiple open seats. The hostess literally refused to seat us at the bar and seated as at a \"community table\". We waited at the table for a while, staring at the number of open bar seats, and finally decided to go up to the bartender and ask if we could sit there.   The bartender said that the hostesses were being weird tonight and to go ask them if we could sit at one of the many open seats. We went back up to the hostesses, who gave us a lot of attitude for simply asking if we could sit at one of the open seats. We literally just wanted a bar seat, where there were many, many open.   Instead, we received rude and nasty attitudes from the hostesses. It was literally ridiculous. Went to Copper Blues instead, where they treated me like a human being. Avoid this place at all costs if you care about good waitstaff.   It was my birthday, an I just wanted a good cocktail. Instead I received rude looks and mean attitudes and wasn't allowed to sit at a half empty bar. I used to love this place, but now I won't be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I experienced B&T about a year ago and I've been meaning to write a review. The first thing we noticed that we enjoyed was the ambiance upon entering the front door. We stumbled upon this place by accident--just strolling the downtown PHX area. The outside is modest and we weren't sure what we were walking into. :-) Everything about this place is hip. The menu is fun and playful, ... and the \"MARKET MEAT & CHEESE BOARD\" was amazing! (highly recommended!) The drinks are clever and endless. And even the tab at the end of the meal (named \"the damage\") was funny! The owners put some thought into this place and spared no expense when it comes to ambiance, quality of food, and even the servers. I would give B&T 4.5 stars if possible. I save 5 stars ONLY for the truly EPIC experiences -- which this place comes close to.   Taking a couple of buddies of mine there for a guy's evening in a couple of weeks."}
{"text":"Im a bit torn about this place, the first time I went in on a weeknight for happy hour and the service was great and the atmosphere was cool, although the tequila cupcake was stale and I had to throw it away. The second time I went in on a Saturday night and the food was terrible and expensive for what I got. Ill give it a third try but maybe during the week for happy hour only.  The popcorn is very good, and its $5.50 during happy hour.  Dont get the Grilled Cheese bread, it is $6 and super small and just not worth getting.  The Meat and Cheese board only had a few things that were good on it, the meat, 1 cheese and bread.  The potatoes are good, like a deconstructed potato skin or potato nachos with no cheese.  The potatoes are not thin like chips but rather thicker but they are cooked well.  Worth getting during happy hour as well."}
{"text":"Awesome place to go cool atmosphere and you won't find any better cocktails in Phoenix for sure if u are in the down town location please check this new place out you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"I love this place. The vibe. The drink selection. The drinks. And THE TACOS. Referred to as heavenly tacos between my friend and I. He described them as seeing rainbows and all things color when he took the 1st bite. Can't say he's wrong. The place is a little spendy, however, worth it. I'll miss this place when I move."}
{"text":"I wish I could give 5 stars, but the food is not the focus of this joint. All of the cocktails I've tried are on point!!! My first visit, I tried the street tacos, they were good but very small in size! This time I ventured to try an entree and went for the pretzel burger! Since the burger came with NOTHING, I paid for a \"side-o-chips\". Neither the pretzel burger or the side o chips were worth the cost! Presentation was boring and even more boring was the flavor, especially the side o chips and the \"twisted ketchup\" it came with. I tried to add salt for some flavor, but nothing helped. A friend ordered the popcorn and that was better than either of my dishes! Like I said, GREAT DRINKS and worth the $$, but food...not so much! Still a cool place to meet friends and they have a great staff with excellent customer service!!!"}
{"text":"We tried to check this place out the weekend of ComiCon but it was packed and the hostess recommended a reservation.  So, we waited a few weeks and did exactly that.  I read the Yelp reviews and was \"ready\" for some issues.  The first half hour or so was fabulous and I was all set to write a those-people-are-whiny-bastards review.  And then things went downhill.    The good: Drinks are fantastic.  The drink menu is a small novel and the first two pages are the owner's creations.  Between the five of us, we sampled nearly all of them.  Innovative, fresh and well balanced - a cocktail enthusiast's dream.  We ordered a number of things off the menu and overall, it was tasty but the food doesn't hold a candle to the cocktails.    The bad: I'd say the \"service\" needs work but we were pretty sure it was just our server.  We ordered the corn dip without bread crumbs to accomodate a gluten-intolerant person in our party.  Literally, a half hour went by and the dip hadn't arrived and we asked the waitress who assured us she put the order in.  The dip came out about ten minutes later and it was obvious that she'd forgotten to put it in AND it had bread crumbs on it.  People make mistakes and that's totally cool.  But what bothered us most is that she didn't own up to it.  Her attitude changed after we asked about the corn dip and she seemed pissy and short.  She then proceeded to screw up a very simple bill split and we ended up having the manager fix it.        We did speak to the manager about the above issues and he was extremely apologetic, appreciative of our feedback and very friendly.    Will I go back?  If the \"need reservations\" thing is always, it's unlikely.  There are plenty of places to drink at CityScape that don't require reservations and I have not yet reached the point where I can justify (or want to justify) reservations just to have drinks."}
{"text":"I love this place! Every cocktail has been fantastic even if it's not one I personally enjoyed, and the food is great. The menu's a tad small, but it means that everything is delicious. The mac n cheese is more of a jalapeño one than true green chili, but it's amazing regardless. I crave the smashed chips nearly every day! I most recently tried the hurricane popcorn and fell in love. The staff is always friendly and hella knowledgeable, too. I haven't gotten everyone's names yet, but one lady introduced herself to me and my party last time we went (I think her name was... Lo?). Every server we've had has been attentive and more than happy to recommend drinks.  Sure, the place is a little bit more expensive than a Chili's or dive bar, but the $2-4 difference from those places gives a HUGE step in flavor, atmosphere, and overall experience. If you need something cheap instead of $9-15, they do a weekly thrifty cocktail for $6.50 too. I could see this place at home in LA and charging $5 more than they do, but the price point and food quality hits the perfect spot for me. 15 pages of cocktails means you'll find *something* there, and you'll have a great time. My friends can't get me to shut up about this place!"}
{"text":"How does this place only have 4 stars! It should have 6! We went on a eating/drinking restaurant hop of phoenix and this was the clear winner.   The bartender( that happened to be the owner) was very informative and makes some outrageous drinks. He didn't seem bothered by our endless questions (which we had a ton of because the drink menu is so large).   The drinks were all some of the best tasting drinks I have ever had. I had a passion fruit Collins (happened to be on happy hour) and not only did it have a great passion fruit flavor, it is garnished with real passion fruit!   The food. Ramen burger. I can't even explain how out of this world it was. Just get it you will not be disappointed.  Seoul fried chicken. Watermelon kimchi with the bite of chicken. Unbelievable and it was on happy hour!   I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Trendy, witty, and delicious are my three choice words to describe this bar. The drinks are cleverly named and delicious, the menu a purchase item/magazine. This place has the feeling of trendy bar back in the day when drinks were intricately made and personal. The drinks are pricey and there can be some attitude here but that's part of the fun."}
{"text":"First time here. This place is dope on a rope!!! The bar guys name was Tim, he made me a Reposado that totally kicked ass!!! Love this spot. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that the drink menu is very unique and provides it's own entertainment. There are so many fun, I interesting,  and delicious cocktails here. My issue cane with the service, it was not good. This was my first experience here and the servers were unfriendly,l and just seemed to not enjoy their job.  We had 2 different servers because out first one got sent home and the attitude did not change. This was a bummer because our experience could have been so much better."}
{"text":"This place was cool. But the customer service was awful. I mean we were celebrating a birthday and our waitress was so \"bitter\" literally that it sucked the life out of my experience here. Drinks were good, but again service with a smile goes a long way.. and communication with your table is golden. Not sure I would come back."}
{"text":"With the majority of the menu being drinks, you'd think it would be treated as a bar and you could just walk right in and sit at the bar, but you can't. There's a limited amount of space, and therefore seating. They should have made it two levels like Hanny's so they can get as much seating as they could from the space. Anyways, expect the wait time to be 20 minutes on a Saturday night even if you just want a drink and are not looking to eat.  The menu is impressive revealing that they have a seemingly endless supply of a multitude and diverse range of liquors. The largest drink menu I have ever seen. There's bound to be a drink for everyone no matter how picky you are. The menu is also fairytale inspired which is endearing, everyone from The Mad Hatter to The Princess and The Pea is included.   The Duck Bath Punch actually requires three people to be present at the table in order to purchase it which I found incredibly strange. What about couples, what about dates? Two people should be the minimum. Also, heads up, the famous punch is $50. Be ready to split that heavy tab."}
{"text":"Such a fun place to grab a drink!  The food looked yummy too but we went after having dinner elsewhere.  I love the themed drinks and they are a good price for the quality you receive.  The service was too notch and the waitstaff was ready to Answer questions and make any accommodations you needed.  Will be back for a fun girls night out soon!"}
{"text":"FINALLY!  Arizona's been waiting WAY too long for something of this caliber - incredible!  Service, staff, and the best part....the COCKTAILS- mind blowing and spot on!!  Thank you Ross Simon and crew"}
{"text":"Not going to fake it, I do not know the names of the ingredients of the cocktails nor what they are. Even though I been to many bars in the SF Bay Area, got a degree in Biochemistry. I do know the science name for alcohol is ethanol and the best you can get is 95% ethanol unless you do a special distillation. Visiting from out of town, I heard about this place and had to try it. The cocktails are amazing, especially the bourbon berry one and the passion fruit one. They were well balanced, flavors not overly sweet or sour or medicine like.  Food was also amazing. The Asian influence menu brought me back good memories and made me feel like I was at home. Really recommend this place."}
{"text":"Fantastic drink menu. Very well thought out and lots of attention to detail.  I was there last night and the drinks were amazing.  I just saw a few negative reviews below, but I don't think you can judge a place on it's opening week.  A line out the door and a 5-deep bar with people is a good problem to have, albeit an initial inconvenience.  Things will calm down after a few weeks.  They should give it another chance.    So, glad this bar is finally open!  Phoenix needed a place like this!  Thanks, Ross!"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere.  The drink menu was a bit overwhelming and took quite a while to decide what we wanted to drink.  Many of the drinks seemed very sweet and looked good on paper, however they might leave you with a bad stomach hangover the next morning.  The boyfriend got some lemongrass and vodka drink and a moscow mule, I got a mojito.  My mojito tasted fine, however there wasn't much to drink in it.  The cup was mostly filled with ice, a ton of mint, and a handful of limes...and when I mean mostly I mean that only about a quarter of the cup had liquid in it to drink and the rest were the \"fixinings\" for a mojito.  I might want to try this place for the food if I was ever in town again.  Service was fine."}
{"text":"Friendly and intelligent staff. Awesome atmosphere. Drinks may be expensive but worth every penny."}
{"text":"It's usually hard to get in at times but if you use open table and reserve in advance you can get in.   Crazy vibe like no other.  Funky menu for drinks.  Simple food menu. Great fish and chips. Awesome potatoes. Korean tacos are bomb. Bartenders know their stuff. Drinks are ridiculously good."}
{"text":"Bitter & Twisted was the first stop on my weekend trip to Phoenix and can't imagine a better place to visit right after getting off the plane!   FOOD: Ramen Burger. Chicharron Salad. Lemongrass Collins.   The drinks menu looks a little overwhelming, but the back has the top ten drinks! Although I am not a mixed drink drinker, the lemongrass Collins was pretty tasty. Ginger beer is always tasty to me. The ramen burger is highly reviewed on Yelp and for good reason. The ramen burger, a burger smashed between two ramen buns with onion and a jalapeño mayo. I must say, it is a little messy, but I did enjoy the concept and it all came together! The chicharron salad was interesting. A shell of chicharron with salad fixings inside proved to be tastier than I thought. The fat from the chicharron with the light vegetables on top was a good combination, but I'm unsure if I would order again.   SERVICE: Our waitress was amazing but I missed her name (shoutout to her cool tattoo sleeve and amazing job!). She was great accommodating our party of 11 and splitting the bill and making sure our group was happy.   What a great place to go in downtown Phoenix! I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The food is good, the duck bowl drink did taste like alcohol straight out of a toilet though... not going to lie. Drank it, we loved the ducks and it was great for sharing but wish it was also great to the taste. I would save the money we used on that and wish we would of gotten individual drinks. Service was also a bit slow... maybe ill give this place a try again in the future but wont follow the same footsteps. Individual drinks and maybe we'll sit at the bar next time."}
{"text":"Fun, casual place to come after work or before a sports event. Their Hurricane popcorn is awesome! It's a must have when I visit. They have fantastic food - great salads and other menu items. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I cannot say how dangerous this place is. They should have a warning sign at the door saying \"caution you may not leave due to the many amazing libation choices ahead\". Bartenders (including the owner) were friendly & gave great fast service. Drinks were made with care & tasted for perfection.  I will return many times over for service like this and to make my way through the thirsty menu. If you don't get the popcorn you will not get to experience the absolute perfect snack to accompany cocktails. The menu is extensive and creative. Make a visit and you will NOT be disappointed. This is not the \"gimme 4 bud lights\" type of bar so fah get about it!  I may be at the bar if you drop by. Much love to this establishment."}
{"text":"I really wanted to rate this place 5 stars but the experience left me Bitter & Confused.   It all began at the door with the bouncer, security guard, door handler, reservation maker, people counter, whatever you want to call him stopping me at my tracks asking if I already have a party inside. I replied \"no, just trying to get drinks at the bar,\" We went back and forth as he continually asked me a series of 'do you have reservations' questions making it sound as though there were a private function going on or that the bar has reached max capacity. Finally he goes, \"you need to make a reservation and your entire party needs to be here.\" I really thought this is a walk-in bar but the guy made me head to the hostess stand and make a reservation which was not needed given the place was EMPTY! So the hostess says she can seat us immediately (SHOCKING) and the bouncer, security guard, door handler, reservation maker, people counter guy insists he needed to escort us to our seats. Ok then...   We got seated at a dining table..which felt a little weird because we wanted to just hang out at the bar but were told that everyone needs to have a seat...hmm? Later in the night we also watched this same guy tell every person seated at the bar to stand up and scoot down a chair so that a couple can sit down.  Ordered our first round of drinks, the drinks were good with appropriate amounts of liquor, mixer, etc. Definitely on the pricier side for a Phoenix bar, but average if you're in a big city like NYC. The service was pretty terrible, super slow and inattentive (get your food with no serviettes, then forced to have to wait for your waitress to finally come around and ends up forgetting to bring them to you altogether after you've asked..sigh..).   I'm not sure if the owners were going for a speakeasy theme or what with the door guard dog and assigned seating, but that has really deterred me from wanting to come back. My advice to the bar owner is to open the place up and make it more welcoming...I probably would have stayed longer, ordered more drinks and tell my friends to go check it out too."}
{"text":"Good food. Great drinks. Good service. Unique bar food but great for cocktails. The ramen burger is delicious but different. A little pricey but expected for a downtown trendy atmosphere."}
{"text":"I am in love with this place. I dream of sitting in a bathtub of the Hurricane Popcorn, it is that good! Every cocktail I've tried is delish. My fave is the Limoncetta. Such a creative, wide variety of cocktails on their menu...And the food too. Recently we had the Seoul Fried Chicken and can't wait to have it again. The hype has simmered down a bit now on this place, so I feel more comfortable coming in to have a drink and something to eat before a concert or dinner downtown without fearing there is no space at the bar to enjoy a few drinks and apps. I need to remember to check out one of their specialty cupcakes some day. I see them on Instagram all the time and they look devine!  Kudos to this establishment for staying consistent with product and quality...I've never been disappointed when I visit."}
{"text":"God I wanted to hate this place so bad.  I saw the 'mixologists' working the bar and the clientele was primarily Cougars and pretentious hipsters. When I asked the bartender for a 'really dirty vodka martini' I assumed he would F up the simplest drink known to man.  He asked if I would like them prepared 'behind the dumpster dirty' to which I replied emphatically 'yes'.  This dude did not disappoint.  This martini was dirty but still classy at the same time.  Like Marissa Tomei in the movie the 'Wrestler', she's a dirty stripper but really a good person.  That's how this martini was prepared.  Cheers to this bartender.  He looks like he could use some sleep but other than that he was on point like an icicle.  I would recommend this place even to people I don't really like."}
{"text":"I have heard amazing things about this place for ages but never actually made it until a couple of ago. I was walking around the area with a friend and she suggested we had a few drinks there. As soon as I walked in, I loved the vibe. I suddenly felt like I wasn't in Arizona anymore, it was like I was a in a big city like NY or Chicago. Awesome stuff. Then comes the best part: the drinks. I love mojitos, but it's not an easy drink to make so it tastes perfect. I had 3 or 4 and they were all on point. Absolutely perfect! The size, the taste, the strength, etc.. worth every penny! My friend and I also shared the pork belly, delicious! I honestly can't wait to go back and enjoy some more mojitos soon."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the array of cocktails! There were so many to choose from  the large cocktail menu/book. Had the ramen burger and pork belly which was pretty good."}
{"text":"Loved the ambiance and the drinks. Didn't try the food, so don't feel like I can give it 5 stars, will try the food next time I go for sure!"}
{"text":"This place was fantastic!  We stumbled upon this place after our dinner plans elsewhere fell through. I'm so glad we ended up here!  We had the Korean Nachos, which were amazing!  I was sad when they were all gone and wished I was hungry enough to order more. We also had the Belly Buns, and these were really good as well!  The cocktail menu is incredibly long!  We had fun just reading through it. I really liked the Lime in the Coconut and he Solerno (I think that was the name... not sure.). We will definitely try this place again. It's nice that they use the Nowait app, too. Definitely a place to check out if you're downtown!"}
{"text":"Some things just make you wonder where common sense has gone...   I've been aching to find a cool cocktail bar here in Arizona ever since I moved from Chicago a few months ago.  When \"Bitter & Twisted\" popped up on Yelp last night while out with a group of friends, I thought \"Sweet! Let's check this out.\"  I'm a fan of all kinds of amari and bitter spirits, so with a name like \"Bitter & Twisted\" I thought I must have landed upon my own mixology heaven.  After glossing over the (large) drink menu three times and reading the descriptions of the cocktails, it gradually dawned on me that despite their name they had no offerings for a palate like mine.  Lots and lots of fruity cocktails with white spirits, but nothing bitter and twisted.  Oh well, first disappointment.  So I decided to simply try a new spirit.  Browsing the back of the menu with the list of spirits they offer, I chose the Pernod Absinthe and pointed to it on the menu to the waitress who didn't seem to be familiar with the name.  It was listed as $16.  Expensive, but I find it a worthwhile investment to try a pour at a bar before buying the whole bottle at Total Wine ($70 in this case).    Lo and behold, when I get my bill as we're leaving, I see that my absinthe was $27!!!  Ummm... how?  The explanation is that since I got it neat there's an up-charge and gratuity is included since we were a group of a certain number.  After grudgingly paying for my tiny $27 2oz pour, I went back to look over the menu to make sure I hadn't missed something.  Sure enough a couple pages before on the menu in fine print at the bottom was a notice that: \"House standard pour is 1.5oz.  All neat/rocks pours are 2oz and are priced accordingly\".  They were kind of enough to acknowledge the confusion and took off the obligatory gratuity from my bill, but \"couldn't take off the up-charge because that's the price of drink\".  Hmmm... thanks.  Moral of the story: Who the heck orders a spirit and doesn't get it neat or on the rocks???  So, what in the world is a \"house standard pour\"?  If I order a spirit with a \"$16\" next to it, I expect to pay $16."}
{"text":"This place doesn't disappoint! Hipster little place in the historic Luhrs building downtown. They have a decent happy hour menu and a huge selection of cocktails. The menu can be a little overwhelming if you don't know what kind of drink you're in the mood for. But overall haven't had a cocktail I didn't like. I enjoy sitting at the bar because it's almost like a show watching the bartenders make drinks."}
{"text":"First off, most people don't know what they are saying. The English guy behind the bar is very attentive and his wife makes the best cupcakes I've ever had. This place deserves six stars, however, yelp in all it's wisdom only allows 5 so that will have to do. So take your girlfriend and \"bite her and twist\" your way down to this place if you have a sane brain cell left in your head. It's no accident the accidental connoisseur is the second best thing besides the English bloats wife's cupcake that you will put in your head here."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here. The drink menu is extensive but as I find in all well run bars is to just tell the bartender your spirit preferences and flavor pallet and he will create the perfect drink. Our bartender, Kiefer, was a total pro and was able to create my favorite drink which is called Bees Knees but substitute the gin for Japanese whisky. It was spot on.  I like this place because it's the perfect marriage between a speakeasy and a gastro pub without any of the attitude.  The food is creative and delicious. I look forward to coming back and making a whole nite of just eating and drinking here ...then probably calling a cab.  Lol."}
{"text":"I want to start by saying that I am a frequent B & T goer. I have been for 2-3 years. This place is phenomenal. Food, drink, staff, all of it. The owner is awesome and the bartenders are some of the most amazing pleople you will ever meet. I whole heartedly believe that this place deserves a 5 starts for those combination of reasons. However, I would like the public to understand that to get into this place, you are required to cross paths with the 5ft 6in \"security guard.\" This individual has unfortunately ruined the experience for me time-and-time again. He flat out sucks. Little-man's syndrome is strong with this one. If you have had a single drink, if you have a girlfriend for him to be jealous of, or if you have a friend who isn't white... Good luck getting in. This troll of a person does not like anything that \"is out of the ordinary.\" I hate to be the guy to do this (and believe me, I understand the exclusivity of this bar), but I've been a regular to the establishment for years and this guy has lost money for the business over and over and over again with his sense of power. If this a**h**e got fired I (and every other person looking to drop money) would increase revenue exponentially."}
{"text":"When our men are busy riggin', rigger-wives are out there boozin.   I accompanied my hubbs during the Whatever USA tour in Phoenix. He was, for the most part, working til the early evening. I met his colleague's wife and we instantly clicked.   During our first meet without the hubbies, we initially thought coffee, but said naaahhh let's go grab a few drinks instead.  We walked across the street to Twisted, conveniently of course, and sat ourselves at the bar.   I loved the very limited but compelling menu. I was really pushing for the ramen burger, but we had lunch two hours prior. Instead, we got the smashed potatoes, a peach signature drink and a mojito.   The peach drink --- wow it was so luxuriously delicious. And the smashed potatoes were crispy outside, fluffy inside atop other creamy yumminess.  We had an excellent time and the staff was attentive though not obtrusive.   This would be a great place for a girls night. It's the type of joint you'd find in hollywood or new york-- highly recommended."}
{"text":"From safe, reliable menu options to the adventurous Bitter and Twisted is an interesting and fantastic downtown adult cocktail and snacks or light meal place.  Happy Hour or Pre-Show fabulous."}
{"text":"Very neat place! Came here on Friday with a group of friends and it was a very relaxed place. A few drinks weren't as satisfactory and the server Jessica had those replaced right away. A lot of different cocktails which I had the lemongrass Collins and it was very good! Will be back again!"}
{"text":"The amount of work that this place put into the story book of their drinks is outstanding and deserves a stand ovation.  The drinks are definitely worth the wait.  There are so many drinks to try and it can seem over whelming but ask your server what their top picks are.  We asked our server and her recommendations were on point.  The food was so good.  We ordered the pop corn, smash chips, Mac and cheese with bacon, pork buns, Korean nachos, ramen burger and noodles.  Now the pop corn reminded me of the hurricane from back home in Hawaii.  Definitely would have order bags to take home with me.  My one disappoint would have been the ramen burger.  This is a hit and miss at most restaurants who have attempted to do this. This was a miss but good effort.  The burger was delicious but the ramen lacked the flavor that ramen is associated with and that will need some work.  Otherwise I am definitely going back as I have so many drinks to try."}
{"text":"Amazing cocktail bar. We had Narah as our server. She was one of the best servers we have had in years. We loved all the food and drinks and ended up staying here 5 hours to try multiple different cocktails. This place is a must try. You won't regret."}
{"text":"I had passed Bitter & Twisted a few weeks ago while downtown and was intrigued by its description of a \"cocktail parlour\". Lucky for me, my moms birthday was approaching and knew she'd be down with checking it out with me. We were not disappointed! We stopped in for happy hour after work last Friday. The front door isn't marked in any way that makes it look like an entrance, but trust me, when you see a door, you've arrived. We were seated right away at a table facing the extensive bar. The space is adorably decorated, very classic looking with a touch of hipster finishes.  We ordered drinks off the happy hour menu to start; a classic mojito, blackberry Collins, and a blended strawberry margarita-all were good, but the star of the show was the old fashioned we ordered after dessert. It was delicious. And strong! A very nice way to top off our experience. We ordered more food than was probably necessary, but it was a special occasion in a new place! We shared a meat plate which, in my opinion, was somewhat lacking. A few pieces of toast, a couple slices of meat and 2 cuts of cheese along with various sauces and jams. Everything on the plate was delicious, however for $15 I expected a little more. The smashed chips were on happy hour special and I had read other reviews urging everyone to try them. I have to second those reviews. Try them! Thick slices of potatoes, fried to an incredible crispness buried under some sort of spicy and creamy sauce topped with avocado. How can you go wrong? You can't. We also ordered the pretzel burger which, again, did not disappoint. We ended our dinner with the marshmallows on graham cracker sticks with chocolate dipping sauce and the banoffee pot. The marshmallow presentation was stellar. I can't say I was too impressed with the banoffee pot, it was overwhelmingly sweet and the banana taste was artificial.  I had to give 4 stars because overall it was a great experience, however the service was pretty slow. It took about 20 minutes to get our first round of drinks and it seemed like everything that followed was also delayed. In addition, our server advised us that although they don't validate parking, our check would be discounted in some way, and it was not.  Those things aside, I will definitely be back again, and again!!"}
{"text":"From the outside it looks like a hotel but on the inside its a magnificent establishment. I can't believe I used to walk pass this all the time. 9pm on a Saturday, Had to wait 5-10 min for a table for 2.  The drinks are Superb and Original.   I\"m not sure on the name of my cocktail all I know is it has whiskey, ginger beer, a freshly cut blackberry & raspberry with a mint leave on top.  This will be a staple during my bar hoping in downtown."}
{"text":"OK...I'm torn.  We love this place...when we are allowed in!  We have tried to go 4 times.  We were allowed in twice & turned away twice.  The 2 times we were allowed in, the drinks were great and my husband is absolutely in love with the popcorn.  We sat at the bar, and the bartenders were amazing!  The 1st time we were turned away was a Saturday night, and the doorman said it was too busy.  The 2nd time we were turned away was Friday night. Again, we were told by the guy outside the door that it was too busy.  I waited and asked a young couple after they came out, how busy it was inside.  They said that there were only about 10 people inside and that there were plenty of open tables.  They were dumbfounded that we were not allowed in.  I was in a dress and my husband was in a dress shirt & shorts.  We are working professionals who live downtown, but older than the crowd usually there on weekends...I'm 49 and my husband is 51.  Just wandering if it has something to do with age that we are turned away on weekend nights...."}
{"text":"This was the first time that my partner and I have been to this eatery! Very cool vibe for sure...interesting, but limited menu. I had the Ramen Burger, which is something I would never imagine of thinking up...this was excellent, the sauce that is drizzled on top to soften the noodles is a bit spicy, but really good! My partner had the pork belly bites and the potato chips app, both were ok, with the potato chip app, not being my favorite at all, he seemed to like it ok. He also ordered a peach martini, I tasted it, and it was not good at all, while he said it was ok, but he would not order again. For dessert, we ordered the Graham Cracker Marshmallows...this was great, accompanied with a dish of chocolate for dipping. The atmosphere was good, but very loud, which can be distracting during conversation, we were in a group of 6, and it was very hard to hear each other. Overall, I would return, but only if I had a hankering for the Ramen Burger. We were told by the waitress (great service) that the place is really hopping on the weekends, so it is best to get reservations. Give it a try, you might like it a little more than I did."}
{"text":"Visiting from California and Bitter & Twisted has some of the best cocktails I've ever had! The food is also amazing! This place is a must try!"}
{"text":"There are way to many places too enjoy the Phoenix bar scene to put up with this pretentious place. Yes, they have a super thick book of drinks..but the people who go there are mostly being take there by others who want to be impressed they know this place. Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Visited with friends for some cocktails. They were so delicious and innovative. We had four folks and we each ordered two different cocktails so we could taste a wide range. All delicious. There isn't really enough variety on the food menu to allow for a group to get a meal so we ordered snacks to share."}
{"text":"You're in downtown PHX in the sweltering heat anxiously awaiting your tinder date. Seconds turn into minutes, those minutes into \"am I getting stood up?\" and \"am I getting stood up?\" turns into: \"I don't need a man to have a cocktail.\"   But it's ok, because you seek shelter in the closest place and you stumble upon a cocktail wonderland. The menu, albeit it changes, takes you down memory lane with their clever mapping of the drinks and unique names.   I had a \"business class\" old fashioned as it's their #1 drink and my #1 favorite. The careful craft and perfect ratio of ingredients made for one of the top 5 cocktails I've ever had.   I chose not to get a drink on happy hour and treat myself. Don't complain when your tab for two rounds is $40. You knew what you were getting into. You'll also have a very nice buzz as they are not shy of strong drinks.  [edit: I didn't get to eat anything b/c they're not too keen on vegan items but apparently the pork sliders are famous!]"}
{"text":"We had a reservation, and we were seated right away. I got this hipster vibe as soon as I walked in the place, but a good hipster vibe... Not the one you get when you know everyone that works there is going to be arrogant. Nah, everyone was helpful and very nice to our party. It was just one of those places you might feel like is too cool for you. Luckily, I had a few drinks in me anyway, so I was feeling pretty cool myself.   Anyway, they have a huge drink selection which is nice. When I say huge, I mean you get a gigantic book full of all kinds of cocktails. I panic ordered at first and got a Strawberry Sundae. Definitely too sweet for my taste, but like I said... I panic ordered because the book of drinks was so large. The drink itself was still pretty good, and I guarantee people who have a sweet tooth would love this drink.  I ended up getting the Slap & Tickle next. That drink was out of this world good. It was so good, I drank it way too fast. I ordered another because it was so good. Definitely the drink I'd recommend. Not too sweet, just the right amount of tartness.  I'd definitely want to come back. I would have stayed there longer, but drinks are a little expensive for my tastes. Obviously that's going to be the way it is at craft cocktail bars. I knew that going in. Was able to experience some really nice drinks, so glad I got to check it out while in town."}
{"text":"Ask for Zach! Best service at a bar I've ever had. Also, this bar has legitimately good food.   Get the pork belly.   Get the solero.   Check out the back of the menu to help you choose. It has a really cool scatter chart to help. I'm kind of a data geek so I thought it was awesome. Maybe the next iteration could be a bubble chart to add a 3rd dimension! Maybe the size of the bubble could be the popularity of the drink! Oooo Zach, get on that idea!"}
{"text":"Have been here 4 times. Oddly, every time friends had table inside and told me there were few empty tables while the \"wknd night manager\" Paul told us it was all occupied and the wait was 45 min to an hour. If a business has to fake a wait or crowd it sure is not worth my time be spent there. Move on"}
{"text":"I honestly think these are the best cocktails I have ever had. So smooth and crisp. I had like 5, lol. I was in town for a conference and we had an event here. The bar had a great atmosphere full of plenty of seating as well as areas for chitchat and dancing. Classy place but not in a stuck up way. Wear what you want and enjoy some great drinks. The bartenders here have some serious talent.  Have fun!"}
{"text":"There are only so many buildings that have survived the march of progress in Phoenix's long storied history.  The Luhrs Building on Central & Jefferson is one of the few remaining structures anywhere in the valley that can claim to have survived since 1924.  For decades it was largely abandoned and thought to be headed for the wrecking ball like so many of its now long gone neighbors.  But with Downtown Phoenix's re-emergence came private and public investment to restore and revive the almost century old relic.  And on the bottom floor lies B&T, a mixture of old school charm with modern libations in an atmosphere virtually impossible to replicate anywhere else.  It's about time I took in the experience with my own eyes.  My first go around here came on what I thought would be a relatively benign Wednesday evening.  There were no big events going on Downtown and I fully expected a light crowd when I made the decision to grab dinner and drinks here at 5pm.  Welp, lesson learned.  This place was full and at least according to the bartender always is.  Tonight the crowd was almost entirely made up of the Downtown business community with some local and some out of town business folk.  I couldn't imagine how busy this place gets on Suns or D'Backs game nights or when there's a big concert down the street.  For tonight I managed to snag a chair at the end of bar as the crowd continued to swell throughout the evening.  B&T is a cocktail bar first and foremost as is apparent by the lengthy cocktail menu and fully stocked (maybe overstocked) bar.  The bartenders operate at warp speed mixing up dozens upon dozens of mixed drink combos.  It's worth it to sit up at the bar just for the show (and of course to mix it up with the bartenders themselves).  And if you choose to sit at one of the outer tables you might find yourself playing a game on old Nintendo consoles (no, seriously) with whomever you're sharing the table with.  My primary motivation in coming here tonight was food, but I couldn't leave without trying at least one of their cocktails.  My choice this first time was the Sucker Punch.  Sort of a cross between a Pisco Sour and a Daiquiri.  A refreshing drink to be sure.  For the food, it seems like the Ramen Burger gets all the love here.  But I was interested in going against the grain on this trip.  The ingredients in the Dragon Dumpling Burger were simply too intriguing for me to pass up.  The patty on this is a 50/50 beef and pork mixture topped with white melted cheese, spicy mayo, pickles, and caramelized onions inside a toasted english muffin.  If that wasn't enough, it comes with a soy based dipping sauce and a red chili dipping sauce.  My word was this heavenly.  Admittedly it was a messy proposition dumping my burger in sauce, but worth the multiple napkin wipes.  The meat is phenomenal and they didn't skimp on the cheese.  For dessert, there were three options to choose from, but there really was only one choice as far as I was concerned.  The Campfire Marshmallows invoked the same childhood curiosity that I'm sure everyone would feel when they see this on the menu.  The marshmallows are roasted and put on edible graham cracker sticks and you dip them in a bowl of warm melted chocolate.  A word to the wise that this is definitely a dessert meant to be shared.  Of course I finished it, but it was a lot.  Total cost for the drink, burger, dessert, tax and tip came to about $42.  The drink alone was $11 and the burger alone was $13 so you get the idea.  This isn't an everyday type of place unless you've got plenty of money to burn.  I almost wanted to compare B&T to a Sam Fox restaurant, but upon thinking it over B&T is definitely better than that.  Yeah its a little high priced and much like Fox restaurants the ambiance is a home run.  But unlike the Fox concepts, B&T is much more daring and creative with their menu.  And that goes for both the food and drinks.  After all, if you're looking to have staying power of the century long variety the Luhrs Building has had, you'd better be prepared to mix it up.  Just the way B&T's bartenders do everyday"}
{"text":"So amazing! I love the atmosphere, creativity but most importantly the service is incredible! Everyone is so attentive and kind. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Hands down best burger in Phoenix!!!! If you visit Phoenix and don't visit this place, you are missing out on the best Ramen burger ever! My only issue is that they are shut on Sundays and Mondays!!"}
{"text":"Great place to have a few cocktails before heading out. The solero is awesome! The pricing is a little high, but hey you pay for what you get. Highly recommend this place to pregame before heading to you're destination"}
{"text":"Yay a great new spot for downtown! We were excited to check them out on opening night but I'm mostly looking forward to when they really get their groove.   Me likes: decor | booze | food   Me didn't really likes:  The menu was a pain in the ass to read in dark lighting, so we gave bartender free range of what to make us and just asked for something whiskey based....he kinda just walked away....like walked away with no actual acknowledgement. Is he telling us to f*ck off? Is he making us drinks? Should we order from someone else? I hope he brings us drinks because the cocktails look great. But then he came back with three cocktails so we were at least happy with that.   It took us a little while to order some food, so by the time we could order, we were only able to order the late night items. I ordered some of the loaded chip type dish they had (sorryyyyyy I just can't recall the actual name) I watched my food sit at the bar for quite some time and watched so many of the employees kind of hovering around the area before the bartender finally handed it over. I know I know....it was opening night, but.....it wasn't awesome but it wasn't bad.   [fingers crossed that it will be 5 stars next time]"}
{"text":"Great drinks! Great atmosphere! Great service! I thought the drink menu was the food menu because it was huge! Lol! I didn't get to eat any of the food, however, as I looked around the food did look delicious!"}
{"text":"Sadly, a very over rated bar.  It's a fine bar making above average cocktails.  But, it portrays itself as cutting edge craft cocktail bar.  I like bartenders who can make a great drink just with some general guidance.  Each time I generally described what I was after, I ended up with something on the menu.  I asked for something with cinnamon and spice and was served the Czech Please... a decent drink if you wanted citrus (it's a glass full of limes) but not spice.  They have all the tools - but this doesn't bar doesn't crack into craft cocktail stardom - except by pretense- it's really just a good bar."}
{"text":"Bitter and Twisted is one of the best bars in downtown Phoenix!  It has an amazing vibe and over the top drinks.  I am addicted to the porn star martini.  I love anything with some bubbles.  The food is wonderful.  When you go you need to try the smash chips, hurricane popcorn and yum yum noodles.  The staff is so friendly and accommodating!   You can not go wrong with a night out there."}
{"text":"I do so enjoy a great local craft brew, but they have none of that here, so I had to go to Angels Trumpet instead, booo.  As long as you're here though, you might just prop yourself up at the best craft cocktail bar in all of greater Phoenix. Rivaled by literally no one else in downtown, midtown, Scottsdale, the east valley and the west, the bartenders will craft you whatever your taste buds desire.  Menu, please, don't insult their knowledge of the dark spirits, if that's what your into, but me, I usually stick to the lighter spirits. Go up to the bar, return the menu they might have just handed you, and tell them everything you love in a drink. Maybe it's the flavor of basil in a delicious gin drink. Perhaps it's passion fruit along side a tasty vodka. Maybe your flavor is tart, not sweet and with a kick of spice, or the best Manhattan you've ever had but you love them because the amazing orange flavors. Trust me, put down the menu and just tell em what you want out of a drink, you won't regret it, not for one second!  Oh, and if that flavor is beer, I do believe they have a couple taps, just don't expect anything crafty.   If you're feeling like you're on the outside whenever you come in here, it's probably because you are. Let me tell you a secret, but shhhhh, don't tell anyone else. Ask for their \"secret menu\" for a list of drinks and food items only available to the inside crowd here.   The ramen burger is delish, as is everything else I've tried here foodwise, but who exactly can remember everything I've had from the many visits to B&T?, certainly not I.  Happy Yelping Phoenix, I'm sure we'll run into each other at some point down the road, as long as your road brings you to B&T!   ...Obligatory shout out to Jason, he's my favorite bartender, but watch out girls, he's taken. I asked him for a crafty spin on my go to Titos with lime and he knocked it out of the park; it was tart, not sweet, effervescent, bubbly, and delicious, and I order it just about every time I'm there! :-)"}
{"text":"Wow, wow, wow! What a great new addition to downtown phoenix. Ross Simon the owner is a cocktail genius  & is ready to please your palate on so many levels. From a Book O' Cocktails to the food menu this is going to be the new hot spot in town. I was lucky enough to enjoy a sneak peek Friday night and started off with a Singapore Sling & the house popcorn (amazing!!!) the marshmallow dessert comes on a graham cracker stick served with a side of melted chocolate! So amazing. The cheese/charcuterie board is complete perfection. The ramen with cuttlefish is like nothing in Phoenix. Make this your first stop when they open their doors on May 30th. It will be a must go to place!"}
{"text":"Great fun drinks. Truly a place where the flavor of the alcohol influences the mixology. Haven't been able to try the food yet, but looking forward to it! B&T trying to raise the bar of mixed beverages, and I think they are accomplishing it one drink at a time. :) sat at the bar and the mixologist was very busy, but that gave me time to enjoy my cocktail. Everyone was extremely friendly and welcoming. I will be coming back at least once a week. I wrote this great review then got home and realized sitting at the bar totally destroyed not only my shoes by my boyfriends shoes as well. Picture attached. I'm really disappointed. How could resting your feet in the brass rail cut your shoes so badly?"}
{"text":"If you want a bad time, order the angry panda.  There are a lot of strong flavors in this wrap, we have jalapenos, pineapple, anchovies... but the thing that ruined the dish for me was the burnt peanuts. Each bite leaves you with a taste of burnt food.   I will say that the ramen burger and the dumpling burger I had a chance to try were a lot better.  Our waitress seemed angry at us most of the time, so I can't give high marks for that.  The atmosphere is very nice. Overall I'm not sure I would come back"}
{"text":"Great service- quick,  with good recommendations. Solid cocktails. Surprisingly delicious food across apps, salad,  entrees, and dessert."}
{"text":"My two stars are for the concept and location. Other than that, this place was completely disappointing and I will not be back even though I live downtown. Between my friend and I, we had four drinks and none of them were good...seriously, none and we are not very picky. The flavors were odd and not balanced. The ingredients didn't have fresh flavors and came across as syrupy. The staff is anything, but welcoming, polite, or service oriented. I looked forward to going here for so long and it turned out to be a total miss."}
{"text":"I was so excited for this cocktail lounge to open and I was not disappointed.  They did a great job with the space and keeping the integrity of the historical side of the building.  The staff was very welcoming and friendly and the cocktails were dangerously good.  I ordered a beautifully presented drink of strawberry and pineapple vodka with fresh watermelon, cranberry and lemon juice garnished with watermelon pieces...stunning and so ridiculously tasty!  I live in the neighborhood and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Quality scratch cocktails. The largest and most extensive cocktail menu around. It doesn't look much from outside with the frosted Windows, but when you enter, you sort of feel like you enter an industrial, prohibition-era cocktail bar. I had one of the best manhattans I have ever had. My boyfriend had a quality old fashioned, and service was quick. Will be back ... A lot ."}
{"text":"Best drinks I've had in AZ. You can see the time it takes the bartenders to create these drinks. They're classy and delicious. The place is really dark and their creativeness with the menu is why they stand out to me. I would totally recommend coming here to grab a drink. Nothing bad to say about this place!"}
{"text":"Came here during super bowl weekend ( located in heart of downtown phoenix). Sadly they cut their menu down to a third of the original because of the super bowl, because of this we ended up with pork belly and loaded potatoes... neither of which I recommend.  I love the decor and feel of this place, it's sexy, plain and simple. BUT the service, food and drinks (excluding my lemon drop) were average and not worth the $80.00 bill we racked up ( 2 appetizers, 4 alcoholic mixed drinks)"}
{"text":"Great balanced libations, affordable too!  Cool that Phx has a place like this smack dab in centre of town.  Other big cities will have lesser so drinks than Bitter but charge five bucks more per drinks.  I never review but love this place, plus they have 666 reviews at this very moment and that's just scary.  I'm breaking the spell...667 reviews now!"}
{"text":"We came for the Ramen Burger--and fell in love with the atmosphere and cocktails."}
{"text":"First time we came here we were super impressed and bartender was amazing and super friendly! Menu or a story book?! Not sure! but take a look at it!  Came here for the second time to celebrate our engagement and couldn't ask for a better place to spend time with my love one and friends. Friends are visiting from out of the state and by were impress with cocktails and food. Will definitely come back here but not for celebrating another engagement!"}
{"text":"Good drinks, good food. Very, very awkward bill pay where the waitress uses an iPad to pay the bill and you tip right in front of them. Not all technology is a good thing. Stop this. It's unnecessary."}
{"text":"Perhaps it's better sitting at the bar.  Our server had limited knowledge of cocktails, so we were on our own.  The menu has a cutesy tiered pricing systems for many drinks (something like economy, first class, etc.) so seem to want to be able to cater based on price point, not cocktail excellence.  The first round was ok, well-prepared and tasty though not too demanding (French 75, aviation, etc.) but the second round wen we tried to get something more exotic was a bust -  either too hurried at the bar or they sat around too long waiting for the server.  The server charged our second round to the table next too us.  When our ticket looked low, I wondered if they comped us for the poor drinks, but our neighbors seemed shocked at their tab, so we intervened."}
{"text":"The drinks are so good theres an entire BOOK to choose from but the food is even better! I had the pork belly buns for the first time and I seriously couldn't believe how delicious it was! I also recommend the green chili mac and cheese I get it every time has a little kick too."}
{"text":"Good drinks, but the staff seems to hate their lives. Smile and be nice.. I promise, it doesn't hurt."}
{"text":"This is another one of those places that I am super happy and sad that it is not by my house or even in my state.  I would be here everyday and would spend my entire paycheck all the time.  The drinks are amazing, seriously amazing.  The bar itself is pretty cool and it makes you feel fancy but in a total relaxed and casual way.  The service is good but you have to keep in mind that it is a little slow since it takes time to make a quality drink.  They have a humongous drink menu, pretty much a book.  A book filled with tasty drinks.  They all looked amazing and all the ones we ordered were as good as they sounded.   Not sure if they hate or love Yelp because they have a review of the week up on the board to make fun of.  Either way I don't care because the drinks are perfect and I will come here every time I am in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Very fun bar with great food and awesome drinks.  Bartenders were as good as it gets."}
{"text":"Awesome cocktails. Great atmosphere and better cocktails. Will definitely frequent Bitter and Twisted, try it, you'll love it!"}
{"text":"Love this gem in downtown Phoenix. My Partner and I decided to stop in a few weeks ago (May 3rd) for Happy Hour before dance recital at Symphony Hall and turns out they had a private reception. We had checked the site and there was no mention of private party. Sitting for walk ins was very limited and about an hour wait. We wished this event had been mentioned on site so we could have saved time. I must mention that the Hostess was very gracious and apologetic - we did appreciate her kindness. Look forward to the next time around. Cheers***"}
{"text":"Drinks are always the best. Don't come here at the start of the night if you plan on going to other places. It will ruin your drinks for the rest of the night. Nothing compares to Bitter and Twisted when it comes to taste. After here every other place no matter how top shelf the alcohol is it will taste like well."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor. Shut up, listen to your mixologist and hold on!  These guys can make you a drink that will change your life if you let them.  If you think your smarter you're not.  Enjoy the ride!"}
{"text":"25 min wait for a empty bar so you can appear like you are exclusive?! Door man had an attitude like his bar was the only one on the block! We are here at Copper Blues and omg rocks!!!!!! 5/5!!! Amazing music.. great vibe, love it. Move to Scottsdale Bitter Twisted and take your doorman!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I loved both the cocktails I had, one I chose myself and one off bar tender Jasons recommendation.  The menu is so extensive it makes me want to get back on OK Cupid to make boys buy me drinks here. That's how much I want to try everything on this menu.  This place is so good it squashing feminism."}
{"text":"Best cocktail bar in downtown Phx. Went in right before close and had awesome service and amazing cocktails. Bartenders definitely know what they are doing!"}
{"text":"Loved it! I love the speakeasy trend that is happening right now. You walk into the restaurant and a big curtain is blocking the restaurant. Once you go inside it has an awesome speakeasy feel to it. The drink menu is massive, so make sure to study that before you go or you'll be reading a 40 page menu trying to find a drink. The food was great, but we really loved the alcohol infused cupcakes! Make sure to ask your server what they have available that day."}
{"text":"Hey if you want to get bitter & twisted you should do it at this place! It's downtown near the arena and they've got really good crafted cocktails a decent selection of local brews and the food is off the hook!  Ordered the hurricane popcorn to start it's rocking with sesame, nori, shichimi all kinds of fun stuff paired that with the smoked brisket tacos you'll want to get into that it's delicious.  The chilin salad has valentina sauce and comes on a bed of chicharon it's wild!  I was going back and forth on ordering the dragon dumpling burger or the ramen momo burger and went the dumpling yeah it looked like fun and was tasty!  Did I mention local beers? Come down here and get yourself all bitter & twisted!"}
{"text":"Whatever made you Bitter; whoever Twisted you so cruelly; whatever her name was, whatever he did, I want to Thank them from the bottom of my pickled liver/my Froi Gras liver.   Thank them for making you the way you are.   Seriously, I vote we send that person a \"Thank You\"; a Christmas card every year. We should never forget their birthday or anniversaries--because you know a bitch that Bitter & Twisted has left a string of bodies in their wake. (#MadMoxxi)  It's like, the guy who fucked over Adele, ya'know? The guys that made her cry... I want to shake the guys hand.   Who ever that guy is, he deserves half Adele's money because without him being an asshole, we wouldn't have Adele's music.   So thank you, Bitter & Twisted. You guys are fantastic, from top to bottom. And a special shout out to whoever that person is that made you sssso Bitter, sooo Twisted."}
{"text":"Such great vibes in this place. I'm pretty sure they have legitimate mixologists here. They have a huuuuge menu of cocktails and I had no idea what to order. The person who took our order had someone come over to help us decide. He gave great recommendations based on the types of drinks we liked. We also got the s'mores - which are graham cracker sticks with roasted marshmallows on top and a chocolate sauce dip. Love coming here after getting sushi at Squid Ink across the street."}
{"text":"Loved the cocktails but I wish I could remember all of the ingredients so I guess I'll have to go back. The meat and cheese board was good but I don't count beets and cauliflower as \"house pickles\" so I dropped a star on that one. We'll definitely be back when we are downtown again. 5 BIG STARS to the mixologist's  they work their butts off!!!"}
{"text":"Came with a party of 9 at 730 on a Friday. We were able to get a table almost immediately, and barely beat the crowd. Good music, good food, great drinks, great vibes! Great place to start the night off right"}
{"text":"Cozy and cool! Loved coming here. We will definitely back.  We didn't try the food but the cocktails are amazing and the Nintendos at the tables and super cool."}
{"text":"This place is definitely nice but it lives up for its name, bitter and twisted! The \"No Standing Rule\" needs to go! This place has potential but they need to get it together."}
{"text":"Hipster glam is how I would describe the vibe and decor of this place. It is a bar with a ridiculously endless drink menu and a short food menu. The food options are undeniably Korean inspired, which I hadn't expected.  I ordered a Lemongrass Collins from the drink menu, which our server described as being similar to a Moscow Mule (which I'm a sucker for) with vanilla. I also ordered the Korean Nachos.   The nacho chips were light and airy, with brisket, jalapeños, a cheese sauce and crema. The flavor combo was amazing! The only drawback was that the brisket was on the fattier side, which I left behind on the plate, but managed to eat the rest without any complaint. The Lemongrass Collins was also light and very refreshing, with an aftertaste of fresh vanilla.   We stopped in during happy hour, but I wouldn't have considered my final bill to have included happy hour pricing. Was a bit steeper than what I had expected, but to be fair, I was told this place is on the pricier side. Just passing along the good word ;)"}
{"text":"Magnificently creative cocktail menu & a remarkable experience. Lively casual-to-upscale cocktail bar in the very heart of downtown. A bit hard to find if you aren't exactly looking. I believe it is directly across from City Scape & the Hotel Palomar. Cityscape has several trendy & popular bars so be sure to check them our first because you won't want to leave once you get here."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place.  I'm trying.  Struggling to do so.  But the problems start as soon as you find a place to sit down.  There are umpteen tasty-sounding cocktails on the menu.... if you can read the menu.  It is VERY dark in the bar.  I expect the eyes of the waitstaff to atrophy like cave newts if the place survives for very long.  People up and down the bar are using their phones to illuminate the drink and food menus.  Elegant, right?  Due to the complexity of the giant drink menu, you will wait for your drinks.  The bartender was... crisp.  Like at DMV crisp.  Wait... wait... wait... \"Waddaya drinking?\" wait... wait... wait.    It is also notable that this bar is in Phoenix, not LA or Manhattan.  An old fashioned, a martini, and a salad were an eye-popping $40 bucks.    Eventually we were seated at a table.  The server was very quick, and food came right out.  The rest of the evening was fine.  Oh, but bring a sweater.  The A/C system is ferocious.  Every woman in the place was shivering like they were simultaneously passing kidney stones."}
{"text":"We stopped here on our trek to the Grand Canyon, and we sure are glad we did! Such an interesting concept- choose your drinks based on a chart created with your preference of flavor (sweet, sour, bitter) The cocktails here were all amazing! We weren't disappointed by a single one. Awesome spot for anybody in the Phoenix area that loves a well crafted drink."}
{"text":"Great night last night! Enjoyed some of the most delicious cocktails $10-12 each and they were quality! Lemongrass Collins was perfect after having a big meal. Then, I felt like I was back in Maui sipping on the Solero with an actual wedge of passion fruit...yum! Chill atmosphere. Was able to converse with friends. I don't go downtown much but will start going more because of this place."}
{"text":"Went here after work with some friends.  The staff was friendly and the drinks delicious.  There were a few hiccups with service but It was the grand opening and the issues were mainly due to technology problems. Hopefully they will get it worked out.    The meat and cheese platter was delicious.  I'm still thinking about it. We also got the smash chips which were quite enjoyable.    I'll definitely be back. Hopefully all the hiccups will be smoothed out and I can change my review to 5 stars."}
{"text":"Impressive atmosphere. I like the leather couches. The menu is difficult to read in the ambient lighting. Although the menu is very creative. i hear they serve grasshopper in one of their drinks"}
{"text":"I am officially obsessed with this place. It came highly recommended from my sister who went with her boyfriend. Decided to go with them plus one extra. You can't go inside unless you show them the text on your phone saying your table is ready (not sure if this is every night or just on the weekends.) but the ambiance is amazing. the lights are dimmed and the tables can be romantic but it's also great for a group of friends. They have hundreds of cocktail to choose from. I tried a bunch of different ones! One thing to keep in mind: the waitress told us that the drinks in the tall glasses are less strong and the short ones with no ice are strongest. I know this is common sense but still good to know! You should definitely come here on a date or with a group of friends. It's a blast!"}
{"text":"Thanks Ross for the E a r l. - the best burger i ever ate, purchased .  You're a gent letting me order off the secret menu right at bar opened for the evening.  Yum, it's the best meal I could have found in DTWN Phx tonight!  The smashed chips equally wonderful!"}
{"text":"When I am feeling Bitter and a little like getting Twisted this is the place I think of. Okay well, I am not Bitter and I would rather not get too Twisted but, this still has become my go-to place and one that I have recommended often to friends and colleagues in the downtown area. What's not to love? It's classy but not pretentious; a great vibe and music without blasting your head off; and great drinks and also.. If noshing is your thing, that is on point too! I love sitting at the bar sometimes and watching the bartenders shake while they swirl .. always with a smile! I can't say I've ever had a bad drink here or bad service! If the expansive menu doesn't fit your personality or if you are like me, at times, indecisive, these easy on the eyes mix master geniuses of the bar will ask what your lips want to sip on and they can muster something sure to make your palate say 'hmmm' or 'ahh that's it!' At least they always make the nectar to the Goddess that makes my lips happy! I usually go for something on the level of Champagne or French 75 in taste .. sparking and yet not too sweet. The charcuterie board here is perfect too! Oh and for you naughty Yelpers .. be wary of being cross .. you can and will be shamed! I love that Bitter and Twisted has fun with us Yelpers ... but admittedly, if you are reviewing once a year and it's negative for an olive .. just take caution and pick your battles. The place is downtown class and amazing and that is huge! Dare I even say there is now a waitlist that you can jump on via Yelp.. It's fantastic for .. not having to wait in a sometimes lengthy line .. ! Now the next time you want to get a little Twisted .. get in here !"}
{"text":"Bitter and twisted is like the TARDIS; plain and inconspicuous on the outside, fancy and neat on the inside (no, not 'it's bigger inside'). Enjoyable late night food with some amazing cocktails that will sure make me bankrupt... and possibily you! But do not worry, for their services are excellent, and the environment of that place attracts great bar companions that should keep you away from just drinking. This is a place to be!  Also, Porn Star Martini, my first drink, got me hooked to this place. Whoever reads this, it's a must try if you enjoy passion fruit. Dont let the names stop you from trying out their cocktails!"}
{"text":"I went on a Friday night of the second weekend they were open. The food was interesting and good enough. I ordered the Kraken. We also had the cheese board, and my friends ordered the Ramen and Smashed Chips. The best meal from my party was the Ramen by far. The Cheese Board did have some interesting (in a good way) items on it, which made it stand out from others.   The drinks were decent, however not the best I have had. I much prefer Lux or Rum Bar. The drinks were good, but if a place is going to call itself a cocktail parlour I would expect better.   Drinks also took kind of a long time to come out. They were busy, so waiting for that first round is to be expected. For the second round our waitress didn't come by until our drinks were empty, and they took awhile to get out to us.   The atmosphere was a little strange. Something about it just didn't feel right. I feel like it just doesn't have a good downtown Phoenix vibe. Seems more Scottsdale. If I was nearby or a friend wanted to go, I would go again. I wouldn't go out of my way to come back."}
{"text":"I stopped by Bitter & Twisted today with a friend to try out and it was AH-MAZING!! The cocktails are good and let me tell you they don't skimp on the alcohol. Woo!! Was hesitant to try the ramen burger but so glad I did because OH.EM.GEE it was friggin' delicious!! A MUST try! Yum yum noodles were yummy and so were the smashed chips. Not what I expected but they were crunchy and yummy. Butterbrew cupcake was alright. I've had better cupcakes but it was pretty. The waitress was really good about recommending cocktails. Great overall experience. Very pleased and can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"This is a must for any cocktail enthusiast! I had heard about this place a lot from my friends and finally went before a show around the corner. They check your I.D's at the door and then we were seated at a table not far from the bar. I believe I had a porn star martini, which was amazing, and a friend of mine had an old fashioned (also tasty). I also had some delicious key lime tequila concoction, and a gin fizz (I felt like a dick after ordering that and watching their YouTube videos also, so sorry guys!) Their food is also top notch, it's one of the few places that has a ramen burger, and also rotates other specials.   Definitely stop in and check these guys out in action. I will be going back hopefully sooner rather than later. I also heard for comicon they let people in for free if they came in costume, which is amazing!"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to come here for sooooo long!!!! The desert here is definitely 5 stars.. Especially the campfire marshmallow. Unfortunately, the drinks were not everything I expected them to be. If you love whiskey STRONG whiskey you can get their number one drink.. The old fashioned. Although for me it was not enjoyable due to the harsh taste. My other drink the \"quit whining\" was good, but basic. I would come back for the desert but not so much for the drinks"}
{"text":"If I could give it more stars I would!!! Went out on girls trip to Phoenix; did not, I REPEAT, DID NOT expect to have such a great time as I did. And the real MVP of such grand trip? Our Bartender Jason. We had seen the reviews and decided to stop by, did not wait much till Jason spotted me, took our order and from that moment on we were hooked! Not only were the drinks great! But the entire staff was just exceptional. I have to admit we drank several drinks and the following day no hangover! Why? Because they don't use cheap alcohol of course. We left the place so happy that we ended up coming back the following night. And again, nothing but a fucking awesome time. Overall Jason and his crew were nothing But awesome and made a girls trip out to Phoenix one for the books."}
{"text":"Sincer disappointment.  Over the past year I've seen this creative icon go from genius to flat. This last weekend's visit did nothing but reinforce my belief. After an near hour wait, coupled with other circumstances, BT's doorman showed his true colors with a very derogatory slur that took the breath of everyone waiting. There's absolutely no place for this, especially at a place of business, which is dependent on customers. I typically don't reach out to social media, but in this case it couldn't be ignored. Shame on you Bitter Twisted!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. Great atmosphere and drinks. Waitress almost tossed the water glasses on us when we arrived but made up for it with good service. Exhaustive menu of drinks let's you satisfy any whim you may have. Try the ramen burger after a few. Well worth it! Definite do again."}
{"text":"Bitter is a suited name to correspond with the bitter experience that we had at this bar/restaurant.  We have been to this bar when it had just opened and the experience was positive. This was our second visit and we were celebrating my friend's birthday. The setup is quite confusing because you cannot tell what the theme of this bar is. When you first walk in there are curtains draped so that you cannot see inside. It comes off with a speakeasy vibe and ironically the building is the location of where prohibition started in Arizona. Once you go inside, the bar is a mixed of speakeasy, with scifi/pinup?   We sat down and the chairs were especially comfy for tall bar style chairs. The menu is huge and comes with a large selection of drinks. they offer a small food menu as well but even then that was confusing. The drink menu was video game themed and I am a huge fan of video games. Though I was confused how it fit in with a speakeasy theme. At first I wondered if it was an anniversary but nothing quite added up. My husband and I ordered two drinks.  My first drink was in a honey bear container. I had seen it on yelp and decided I had to try it. I was watching the bartender making my 12 dollar drink when suddenly he knocked it over. Half of the alcohol he had poured into this drink poured all out over the counter. I figured her would start over with another drink but instead he poured tons of ice in it to make up for half of the 12 dollar drink he spilled. I was offended and in shock that an establishment like this would just water down my drink and serve it to me instead of starting over.  Our waitress came over to the table and when we told her what happened and that I wanted another one, she just seemed annoyed and confused that we were sending it back. I waited 30 minutes for them to remake my drink and you betchya that I watched them make it, this time it wasn't spilled.  I should have known that we should have left after this. We ordered the taco appetizer to split and I am usually not one to complain but they were so small, I couldn't believe it. These were the smallest tacos I have ever seen. Plus the meat was all burned.  When we finally went to leave, our waitress was just gone and we waited over 30 minutes for someone to check us out. The waitstaff was annoyed and made us feel like a bother that we were ordering any items at all.  Overall, I would not recommend this place. The fact that the bartender was okay spilling half of my drink on the counter and replacing it with ice is appalling. Bitter and twisted, please give your staff some better training. I have never seen so many angry waitresses and lazy bartenders in my life. I'm not sure if it is everyone but my experience was horrible and I would not recommend this to anyone I know. I want to like this place but how can I when the atmosphere is so unwelcoming."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times before and have had great drinks and food despite sub par service..but tonight left me compelled to leave a review..so much so this is my first yelp review ever!! Wait staff and hostess were absolutely the most rude people we have ever encountered..this place needs serious help if they want repeat business!!!!"}
{"text":"Meh..the atmosphere was cool but some other key pieces are lacking. Usually you can easily get a 4 star from me with a good atmosphere, tasty innovative food, and booze but they missed on some key areas. We were there for a few rounds of food and drinks on a Friday evening.   The good:  Cool bar with an extensive drink menu, unique appetizers that were delicious, great presentation of the cocktail menu.    The meh: Beer selection for such a hipster place was shallow and not varied. They also have too much in cans (which I like, but my buddy did not). The fancy cocktails were over iced and not very strong. Our server was not good with more than the basics of being a good server, and she had very limited cocktail and beer knowledge for someone working in a \"cocktail parlor\". I resent that she was not able to offer good guidance on any of our questions.    I guess all of my \"meh\" boils down to mediocre service in an atmosphere that gets elevated from superior service. Likely my wife and I will drop in again and see if we can have a better experience."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times now so I feel comfortable giving them a 5 star rating! The atmosphere is awesome! It's set in the old prohibition offices so it's themed like a speakeasy. When you step in, the actual bar is behind a curtain. The cocktail menu is extremely unique with each  page having unique illustrations that change all the time! The food and cocktails here are absolutely delicious as well. Be warned though, they do mix them strong! I recommend the Solaro and the Seoul fried chicken! My only complaint is very easily fixed. There is usually a wait to get in, but that can be resolved by making a reservation or checking the opentable app. Totally recommend this bar! It's a must stop for locals and those who are traveling through Phoenix!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots for cocktails, reasonable prices for downtown PHX and creative cocktails for everyone. Love coming here for ladies night with my girlfriends."}
{"text":"This is a great bar with exceptional hand-crafted cocktails. We did not have food but the olives were fantastic! A great addition to the downtown landscape."}
{"text":"Trendy, fun place. Tons and tons of different drinks. Come in here with an open mind have fun and try new things."}
{"text":"Came here Saturday night with some friends to try one of their specialty cocktails and found myself impressed.  They menu for both food and drinks was expansive and easy to read. Although we didnt order any food, the selection looked both delicious and interesting.  The cocktails had very mild alcohol flavor and were mixed very well. A true mixologist spot to check out.  The atmosphere was excellent- dark, loungey, and cool; and they featured some of their own cool local art.  I'll be coming back soon! Nice job, Bitter & Twisted."}
{"text":"Get the \"rocket man special\". It's the Dead Guy Ale and Korean Nachos. Finger lickin good if they don't give you silverware. But they'll happily give you the silverware if you need it. Go nuclear, man!!"}
{"text":"Good place wth friends and drinks...the drink menu was incredible....  food was just ok..."}
{"text":"Went for a drink with a friend on Tuesday night. Liked it so much I took a group of 15 the next day for my birthday. Server Beth was great and kept us flowing with food and drinks even when it picked up and was really busy. Fun drink menu with options anyone will like. Server was well trained and did a good job recommending drinks to the newbies. Love the atmosphere and the good is unique and flavorful. The chips were my fav. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Advertised as a hip craft cocktail bar.  Delivered at the level of a TGIF or Chilis.  Odd Plastic cocktail menu's feel very cheap.  Felt like I was ordering on the strip in Vegas or at a Fat Tuesday.  The servers were attentive and helpful and the ambiance was hip (but Vegas-like).  We ordered a Negroni, and a Tequila special.  Neither drink was very balanced.  The food menu was so basic.  We actually left after our cocktail and decided not to eat.  Very disappointing.  I won't go back."}
{"text":"This place couldn't be more fantastic! They have a cocktail menu that mimics a children's story book. Does it get any better than fairy tales and cocktails? Bitter and Twisted is fun and delicious and all things wonderful.  Our waitress, Nara, was efficient and friendly, and well versed on the book of a menu. We ordered at least 10 cocktails and every single one of them (including the two that were off the menu) was spectacular. The meat and cheese board, chopped salad and noodles were great also! Do yourself a favor and get the Solero!"}
{"text":"This place is so much fun! The atmosphere is really cool and when we went the menu was based on different fairy tales with tons of different cocktails, it was really cute. I got two of the Lime and the Coconut drinks and they were so good. I don't even like cocktails that much, but this one had coconut whipped cream and you could hardly taste the tequila. I definitely want to go back here again :)"}
{"text":"I ended up going to Bitter and Twisted on a Friday night. Ambience is very low-key, and great for a night with friends or on a date. The cocktail menu is extensive, and you will spend minutes searching for what to drink. The food is OK, but definitely worth it for drinks. I was seated on the couch lounge, which was close the restroom, and away from the crowd. I personally didn't like being the focal point of traffic. Overall, I will still go again for the cocktails.   Must Get: FruitLove Melody Cocktail"}
{"text":"Busy place, drinks are great and a big selection of custom cocktails. Foods pretty solid also.  Hip place,  geeks don't bother."}
{"text":"THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE MUST! The drinks were amazing and the dessert was absolutely divine! The menu was an artistic and visual delight! I would strongly suggest getting the banana dessert!"}
{"text":"Oh my god! Where to begin? First off this place has such a cool ambience right from the moment you walk in. The service was so great the hostess and our waitress were very kind and informative our waitress never forgot about us which is impressive considering how busy this night was (Saturday). The food was beyond delicious! And don't get me started on the drinks!! They have 100's (not exaggerating) of yummy/unique drinks. If you are thinking of stopping by on a Saturday night just a heads up make reservations since it is a like a 30min wait but totally worth it guys!"}
{"text":"What took me so long to get my butt in this place?! B&T is a gem of Downtown Phoenix. Kind of hidden on the corner of Central & Jefferson, the tiny sign is easy to miss. But please don't take as long as I did to go here. My fiancé and I have made attempts to go here on busy nights when the wait was up to 2 hours but this particular Friday night, our party got seated right away. Be prepared to show ID. At night, the interior is a bit harder to appreciate because it is barely lit but I have seen photos of it during the day and can confidently say that this place is pleasing to the eyes. It is on the smaller side which would explain the wait on certain nights. Our first experience here was pretty impressive. Our waitress was quick to greet us and take our orders and our food came out in pretty good time. We started with the hurricane popcorn because if popcorn is on the menu, we get it! And it is very good and packed with flavorful wasabi peas and rice crackers. I definitely suggest it to munch on with drinks. I ordered the Yum Yum noodles with pork belly because my foodie friend and fellow Yelp Elite (Janelle E.) has been raving about it since B&T opened and O..M...G. Where has Yum Yum Noodles been all my life?! So good and packed with flavor. It is amazing on its own but adding pork belly is perfection. Trust me. We also ordered the street tacos which were good but not memorable. I'll probably skip them next time. After finishing this order, my fiancé still had much room in his tummy so we went with the infamous Ramen burger and a side salad. The burger was good to try but it is probably just a one-time experience. I would have probably liked the Ramen \"buns\" to be a little less crispy like one I've had in Hawaii. It can be improved on, I think. And it is pretty messy to eat. But perhaps it depends on the day. I am still glad that we tried it, it was certainly a treat. The service was super attentive at the beginning of our meal and we got a little less attention towards the end which is forgiveable. However, talking about B&T now makes me really want to go for Happy Hour and those Yum Yum Noodes! I am coming back for you."}
{"text":"I stopped by here about an hour or so before closing. Bartenders were pretty cool and gave good recommendations. Drinks were on point. The Korean nachos were exactly what I needed at that hour, but I wish I didn't try to finish it off myself. Instead of tortilla chips they use fried wonton skins."}
{"text":"This place is a gem! My friends that come into Phoenix always rave about this place. They told me I had to come eat the Dragon Dumpling Burger. A pork/beef blend with spices. Very juicy on the inside patty on a english muffin. Mixed with the jalapeno mayo and the dumpling dipping sauce. Don't forget the pickled daikon and carrots. This is a magical thing to eat. The ramen burger was really good and so was the noodles dish. I also love the cool menu they have here for drinks. They've got some vintage nintendo games by some of the tables.  Recommendation: Dragon dumpling burger"}
{"text":"Great booze, great bartenders,  fun atmosphere and tasty snacks! A must stop in DT Phoenix."}
{"text":"Stopped into the because we liked the building's architecture, and I was very excited to discover what we walked into. The bar was too full on a Saturday evening to play one of their video games, but their menu was a video game in itself!  Although a little overwhelming at first, the game themed drinks menu was very entertaining to read and the drinks wonderfully varied. We went with the lime coconut & slap n tickle. Loved how the bartender made it, very flavorful and not too much of anything.  From the menu, the spam maki and pork belly buns stood out. For those who do not turn their nose up at spam meat, the maki roll tasted like a low-carb tempura tuna roll. Like, how does one taste rice from a bit of spam...? I enjoyed how the uniqueness. And as for the pork belly buns, they were extremely rich--which was offset by the side of cucumbers you sandwich in there. The pork belly marinade was too flavorful for us, so we did not finish it, but it would go very well with a lighter flavored dish.  The service was also very attentive and efficient. I enjoyed seeing how quickly customers were able to choose their tab using the tablets the server's carried around.  I'll be back for more tastes in the near future!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere of this place the cocktail menu is extensive and creative, I've been here a few times for girls night out and as a date great venue for both occasions. Seating is limited it seems ...we've had to wait outside with the bouncer before being seated but usually not for more than a few minutes."}
{"text":"Interesting place.The bartenders really do know their stuff and make a mean cocktail of your choosing or pick one off the board/menu. Either way it is a win win. Make sure to try their popcorn which is DELICIOUS! Hell I may go back just for that reason alone. The staff are very friendly and I swear I saw the chef deliver food to a few tables. Maybe I was mistaken but still if that was the case, that is what I call SERVICE! All in all it would be a great date night place if you happen to be in the area and have you are on a date (just saying) :)"}
{"text":"This place is the place to get a wide selection of drinks. Everything is really good and they have a really cool menu that you can choose from depending on your mood. Nice decor, good vibe, and a variety of peoples.   The doorman was a real pushover. His name was crystal? I'm not sure. Make sure to download the NoWait app and put yourself in line. The first time we went we waited 30-45min and when we went in there were empty tables everywhere.   The manager, Paul, was a real good guy. We escorted us in and seated us. He was waiting tables, cleaning up messes, and conversing with people.   Overall, a good spot for drinks and to hang out. Avoid the angry doorman's army like attitude by downloading the app."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and I love that they have a non-alcoholic drink menu in addition to the extensive variety of drinks they offer. I tried the cucumber spritzer and it was absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is pure perfection! From the drinks to the service I can't say enough about how wonderful this place is. Our waitress... wait.. I mean our drink GENIUS was amazing. You could give her one word of what direction you wanted to take your drink.. (fruity, floral, decadent, unique, etc) and she could look straight into your soul and pull out your deepest desires. I have been here many times and will be back many times again. Ask for Jenna she is the drink GENIUS."}
{"text":"What can you say bad about a place, when even the doormen go out of your way to make you feel good on a busy Friday. Yes, it took a 15 minute wait, but they sent us to Blue Hound (where they found a great Mezcal we can't find at retail...but that's another review). Texted us in exactly 15 minutes and we had a choice of table or bar...when guys are whipping up cocktails, take the bar. We had a few bartender recommendations for different drinkers in the group, and I had a Pisco Sour...because they could make one. Drinks were great, bar food was spot on. YumYum noodles with pork belly, grilled cheeses bites, smashed chips, and the chili mac; all were exactly what we wanted at 9:30. And, the tab was reasonable...not LA, not Scottsdale. Loved it."}
{"text":"I really... Really wanted to like this place. The atmosphere gets 5 stars, their novel like menu gets 5 stars, the actual taste of the cocktails gets 10 stars, but unfortunately the service brings this establishment down to two stars. The more time I spent there the more \"bitter & twisted\" I seemed to get. I understand that there is a wait for \"craft cocktails\" but 20 minutes? We placed an order for the short ribs and 45 minutes later asked for the order to be canceled and for our check. They seemed to have more bar backs than bartenders and whenever a bar back or waitress happened to ask of if we needed something (to which we always responded yes because of the 20 minutes of being ignored by our bartender) the order never seemed to get to the right person. I will visit this place again... Maybe in a few months when they get their act together - or maybe next week to see if my yelp review makes it to the \"mean yelp review of the week\"."}
{"text":"This place is a-w-e-s-o-m-e!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Some may say there are too many drinks on the menu but I look at it like a playground! I love to hopscotch all over the menu bouncing from spirit to spirit! The atmosphere is industrial and fantastic. I cannot wait to see more of this place. Prices are great for what u get....."}
{"text":"Ramen Burger is heavenly, with extra crispy hard ramen, onions, green onions, pepper jack, jalapenos, sriacha, and soy sauce!   Extensive drink menu with great cocktails. LIT Up, Whiskey Berry Jubilee, Sucker Punch, Hemingway Daiquiri are personal favorites."}
{"text":"Definitely worth the wait. After our 1st attempt the second time was a charm. We were able to grab a seat at the bar. Our Scottish bar tender was funny, and warm. I had a lemongrass cocktail that was one of the best drinks I've had in ages. The mac and cheese with bacon and jalapeños had me literally moaning and groaning.  Great place for a date or a night our with friends."}
{"text":"This place has amazing drinks! The bar itself is pretty cool too. I would definitely give this place a try if you are in the Downtown Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Yelp 100 Challenge 2018 - 9/100  This is probably the best bar experience I've had in a while, from the good service and ambiance!  Located in the corner of a busy downtown area, Bitter & Twisted always has a line to get in. Luckily, they are connected through the nowait app where you can remotely put yourself in line if you are within a 5 mile range. We were able to put ourselves in line that way and avoided a long wait outside the bar.   When we finally got inside, it was a dimly lit bar with lots of mini tables, perfect for mingling within your group. We were unfortunately sat next to a very interesting couple, who started asking us about our origins and whether if we \"crossed the seas,\" which I found was very offensive. Feeling offended and uncomfortable, I reached out to our waitress and asked that if the guy from the table next to us come and bother us again, that she should call the security. She realized that the guy sitting at the table next to us was probably too drunk, and therefore called her manager. The manager immediately came and assessed the situation, and talked to both parties. She, too, agrees that the man needs to leave, since he also started touching one of my friend.   I was very pleased with their prompt reaction to what had happened to our party, instead of risking losing their customer base and just brushing it off since it wasn't causing a huge scene or anything. I later found in the women's bathroom that they also have a sign asking women to report any questionable behavior if they are feeling uncomfortable.   I am very happy how the management team of this bar takes these things very seriously. Not to mention, their bath tub drink is amazing too!!!   I would recommend this place to anyone who's looking for a good time at a safe place!"}
{"text":"I was taken there for my birthday, and it was awesome. It has the feel of a place back East I use to go to many years ago. The drinks were perfect , and the popcorn was great. Want to have a good time , a few drinks and nosh a bit with friends don't miss this place."}
{"text":"The name alone had me.  Loved the ambiance. It is loud and crowded...everything you would want from a cool, trendy, downtown bar.  Coolest menu ever and amazing types of alcohol."}
{"text":"Fun fun mixed drinks that appeal to your taste buds. Their menu is very intriguing as well and thematic with unique names. It's in the middle of downtown where you can walk from Harumi amd etc. Street coin parking is available but avoid peak times if you can because finding a spot would be a big b!"}
{"text":"Went for my 21st and before I could even tell the bartender he already had a shot in front of me (it tasted like Christmas! Amazing!!!) the drink menu (more of a book) was a little overwhelming so I just told him flavors I like and he said \"say no more\" and made me easily the most delicious cocktail I've ever had. You'll pay about $11 for each cocktail but they are tall and ohhh so delicious! It's a pretty moderate size place and the bartender was so nice and attentive. Def recommend it for a delicious drink"}
{"text":"I've hosted events here for work and they're absolutely awesome to work with.  The food is super unique and always delicious.  The cocktails are truly the best around.  I love a good craft cocktail and have yet to find one here I don't enjoy.  Definitely a cool vibe, a little more upscale décor but I love the industrial feel too it.  A great place to grab a drink before a downtown event!"}
{"text":"Ok gave this place a second shot.  Walked in on a Wednesday evening around 5 and were seated immediately.  I am SO glad we decided to come back and try it again as our experience was really great.  It was happy hour so we took advantage of some foodie deals-hurricane popcorn (omg amazing), smashed chips and yum yum noodles.  Everything was so good with great drinks to match.  I absolutely love the decor and the vibe.  Music was great (90's rap...yes.) and our service was amazing!  Cocktail menu is fun and unique (and huge.  It literally is a Book).  I can't wait to come back with friends and explore more of the menu."}
{"text":"You walk in and are immediately transported to what looks like a rooftop bar in Chicago or NYC. Surplus of drinks that are served in funky and creative tumblers. The servers get to know your likings to a deeper extent before making a suggestion for you.  The $6 shots were exciting, new, and delicious!"}
{"text":"My favorite bar in Phoenix! If you're into craft cocktails, this place will have what you're looking for. Just one look at the menu and you'll know exactly what i'm talking about. Yeah so it gets busy on the weekends. Yeah so the drinks are a little on the pricey side. Doesn't matter! I've been here at a least a dozen times and the drinks are consistently amazing. I've been to many many cocktail bars around the country, and i still haven't found any other place with an extensive menu like this one. Thanks Bitter & Twisted for giving Phoenix one of the best bars in the US."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in Phoenix to get 1-2 quality drinks before I go out. (I mean to bed, I'm old). The menu is just stupid. Sooo many amazing choices. The bar tenders are extremely knowledgeable if you need help making a decision. The popcorn is awesome. Go. Unless you hate hipster beards and steal your girl man buns than this is the spot to check out."}
{"text":"This was a great experience with knowledgeable staff and great spirits and food! We sat at the bar and had great conversation with the bartender. The web stated they were closed but we called first and they were open for the championship festivities downtown. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed B&W! Wow. Well here comes a 5 star review: ~Fud/Drink~ The food here is honestly OK. It admittedly is overpriced and I rarely eat here because its just not worth the $ amount unless you are about to keel over from lack of food. Otherwise, eat elsewhere. If you must eat here, the best bang for your buck is to split with your date (if on one) the Ramen Burger everyone raves about. I have had it, it's pretty good...not great...good! Aside from that the drinks set this place apart.  Honestly, just go up to the bar each time you want a drink. If you are on a date, get a seat at the bar. If you can't, wait for a spot to open up. I will tell you all right now, the bartenders here can mix anything up together, just go directly to them and don't order from the waitress ever. For example: I was on a date with the most gorgeous girl on this planet, and I asked her what she'd like in a drink: something fizzy, sweet, and with pineapple. Boom, relayed this to the bartender and in about 8 minutes he concocted this amazing and tasty drink (I tried a quick sip). She was happy. I was happy she was happy. And of course, I was happiest because I had an amazing Old Fashioned to kick back with. Once again folks, the barkeeps here will make your night, no matter your drink of choice...I guarantee it. This is my #1 go-to spot for a hand craft drink in town, hands down. BTW: If you go anywhere else in metro Phoenix for an Old Fashioned, you are just being silly.  ~Service/Atmosphere~  The bartenders are great, personable, fast, and extremely knowledgeable on what they are doing. I do not like the waitresses taking my order, its just not the way I do my drinks in general. They do a great job getting your order in, no doubt...but the quality of my drink was lacking the one time I came here and ordered with the waitress. The atmosphere is outstanding as well, quaint and trendy with an old school feel to it. The old school style inside of an old office building is a perfect setting for a good old fashioned mixology bar. It is anything but your typical dive or drunk's bar... it is classy, as are their drinks and service.  ~The Downlow/Extras~ Not much more to point out...Check out their list of options before ordering, because you might want to pick and choose which base liquors you try that night. There are so many varieties it allows for you to play around and see what you may or may not enjoy. Overall 5 stars goes out for the consistency, great location in downtown phoenix, amazing bartenders, abundant options of liquor, and classy atmosphere. This is my top spot to enjoy a drink with your special someone...You shouldn't take every girl here gents, only the good one's ;-) ENJOY!"}
{"text":"I have been waiting to go to Bitter and Twisted since they opened. And in celebration of our 6th wedding anniversary, we went with a few friends. We had a great time, good conversation, great service and fantastic drinks. They menu is pretty big and intimidating, but ask your server and they'll give you great recommendations.  Our server ( wish to God we could remember her name ) because she was attentive and helpful. We will totally come back and bring friends every time, because everyone should have the opportunity to enjoy an evening at Bitter & Twisted."}
{"text":"Great hidden gem. Drinks are thoughtfully created and artfully made. They have classics and ones you can't find anywhere else. Their liquor selection is extensive, everything from Pappy to Fernet. It's a great place to grab a drink with coworkers after work or bring a date after dinner. Definitely will be back.  p.s no tv's, so don't plan on watching any sporting events there. Not a downside at all, makes it more intimate and genuine but worth noting if there's something particular you wanted to watch with your cocktail."}
{"text":"Quick service and clean. Can't see from the outside I didn't know what to think. After I walked in I'm glad I came for a drink. Def would come here again. Low key and good place to settle down after a long time."}
{"text":"Walked in for a cocktail with 5 of my peeps. Bartender said we needed seats to be served, and said it on the most pretentious way possible. So...We walked out... Go elsewhere unless you like poor service at a bar with d-bag servers who apparently don't know a $250 bar tab when it walks in the door while on vacation. Duh."}
{"text":"This place is a reminder that everything that glitters is not gold! A friend and I stopped in after work today and being frequents of the downtown scene we were quite excited to try something new. Upon walking in I was amazed by how nice this place looked! It appeared to be a gem! However, my positive thoughts end there.  I was not greeted by the hostess. In fact I stood right in front of her for a good 5 minutes before she was even willing to look up. During this time another party had actually walked out due to her treating them the same way. It was busy but it wasn't super packed- no excuse for her behavior. We then waited about 15 minutes to be seated.  Once seated, we waited about 20 minutes for our server to even introduce herself and take a drink order. We had to track down the hostess who was able to locate our server and get her to us.  Another 20 minutes later we received our appetizer. 10 minutes after that we finally got our drinks we ordered with our food.  Honestly, can't tell ya much about the food or drink because I was so irritated by the poor and slow service.  The prices were a bit high which I would be ok with if the service wasn't so horrible. Not sure yet if I'm willing to give it another try. There are too many wonderful places downtown that I'd rather be at."}
{"text":"Bitter & Twisted is a super cool lounge downtown - we stopped in here for desert/after dinner drinks on our girl's 1 year Divorce Anniversary of freedom outing ;)   They made us wait a few minutes at the door, which did not make much sense since it didn't seem overly busy when we walked in, but apparently a lot of people had mad reservations.    The decor is here is very cool classy/trendy.  The music was good and the people watching was fun.  This place out of all the places we hopped around to had the most friendly staff, friendliest crowd, best food and drinks, and the best prices based on quality service and products.    We probably should have come here for dinner to be honest and we probably should have stayed here longer than trek around downtown phoenix hopping around looking for a cool spot to hang out at.  I would definitely come back here again when I am in the area - I really like this place it has A LOT of character and we had an awesome time while we were here!! ;)"}
{"text":"Great cocktails here. These guys are mulling, spinning, shaking and stirring all types of concoctions. I haven't had a lot of food here but I have had the the Korean brisket tacos. They are muy bueno. Unusual with a fried dumpling shell in place of the taco shell. A nice spicy dressing is included.  Easy to get in during the week but the wait can be long on Friday and Saturday night."}
{"text":"Huge fan of this place!  My wife and I were heading to the Bon Jovi concert at Talking Stick later that night and wanted to get a bite to eat and have a cocktail.  After searching Yelp, we discovered this place.  We put our name on the list through Yelp...app said 15 mins.  That was not the case.  Downtown was expectedly very busy.  We ended up waiting 45, but well worth the wait.    We were seated at the bar, which was fantastic because we got to watch the bartenders work.  They made us some drinks, Manhattan and Old Fashioned, both wonderful, and we ordered some food.  I highly recommend the burger on Ramen noodles.  Who would have known Ramen would male a great bun?!  We also had the spicy chicken, which was good little pieces of fried chicken drizzled with a spicy sauce.    We will definitely be going back when we can stay longer.  The bartenders were fantastic, food outstanding, and drinks perfect.  The best thing about this place is they limit the number of people in the place.  I lost the desire long ago to be in a packed bar, smashed together with people spilling drinks, hanging all over you trying to fight to get a beverage from the bar.  One of the best bars I have been to in Phoenix!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a high spirited cupcake, omg. Cupcake so good it went straight to my ass. Walked out of there a whole new person."}
{"text":"I was visiting from Southern California.  I read some of the recent reviews regarding the service (or lack of) and the \"long\" waits.  However, I personally found that the service was fantastic and there was no wait.  Granted, I went on a Thursday evening with 4 other people.  Several times the servers passed out table and asked if we needed anything.  As far as a wait, the place was wide open for evening cocktails.  The drinks were great, try the \"shot in the dark\" and let the bartender surprise you with something!   I can't review the food since, we were their just for drinks.  I'd go again, and don't let those first reviews deter you from going.  On the drink board the even list the \"worst Yelp review of the week\" which is quite hilarious."}
{"text":"What a fabulous cocktail lounge!! Absolutely the best cocktails in town and such tasty food. Swanky, yet chill atmosphere and great service, to boot. If I lived closer, this would be my regular hangout!  The cocktails are inspired and so well-executed!! And the food is so interesting and delicious! They claim to change the menu often, but everything we've tried has been delicious.   We've also had the best NYE experience here, two years in a row: huge bang for the buck and they don't pack the place until it's busting at the seams - it's just the right size crowd and everyone gets a seat."}
{"text":"Amazing cocktails, great food menu and a fabulous happy hour. The yum yum noodles, the fried chicken, nachos , popcorn were all great. Nice ambience as well, with good music. But why are the servers so ... hmm... surly!? It was almost comical. Anyways we didn't let that bother us too much, kept the interactions to the bare minimum needed to get the food and drinks we wanted. Had a great evening!"}
{"text":"Where do I start??!! My finance and I went here for the first time last night and we were BLOWN AWAY! Service, ambiance, drinks, food and fun!! All of the above was perfect! Tim was exceptional in his presentation and knowledge of every drink! Everyone working was friendly and had a smile on their face   The meat and cheese board was so fresh and a great variety! Ramon burger was different and tasty!  Love love love it and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"If you want a little adventure in your mouth, you just might get tongue-twisted after exploring the menu at B & T. The menu is not extensive but offers \"something new, something different\" for those of us who are eager to add new foods to our palette.  Hence, the Angry Panda.  It's a simple dish made up of peanuts, anchovies, scallion, mint, and pineapple. You find out that it's angry because of the sichuan chilies and the jalapeno that are added for good measure.  We tried the \"yum, yum\" noodles, the orange salad, and something else that was new. As for the cocktails, though rumor has it that they're known for their drinks, I failed to taste it.  The cocktails were not extraordinary. They were just good enough and that left me feeling a little \"bitter.\"  B & T is a great place if you are looking to try something new and simple but with a twist.  Who knew  watermelon and chicken could be twisted together on the same plate!"}
{"text":"Fantastic. Creative, intricate drinks handcrafted by skilled bartenders and unique food that never disappoints. I've been here several times and have always had a wonderful experience. The service has always been friendly and prompt.  Yes they sometimes have a wait and have some rules about seating, but what do you expect from a popular establishment? Just plan accordingly. And if you like eye candy, sit at the bar and enjoy the sexy, competent bartenders."}
{"text":"I can't begin to explain the EXPLOSION of flavors from the food and drink I had at this place!! Can we say fireworks! It is forth of July Weekend!! Boom! (Pork belly and smashed chips)  Living in the Phoenix area for 10+ years I remember when there was absolutely NOTHING cool downtown! And well folks, now we have Bitter & Twisted. Problem solved!!   We were greeted at the door by the door check in guy (who only works Friday nights! Shout out to him, whoever he is...he talked up the pork belly, in all honesty it doesn't take much for me to say yes to pork belly!) But his excitement definitely got me and my friend on board! Thanks man!! It was EFFING AMAZING!!!! (Especially in combo with those smashed chips you recommended too!)  We sat down at at table for two. Great atmosphere, good times for a Friday night.  If you have a chance to sit in the bar area, then do it. That atmosphere seems much more fun for two single girls! But the other side is nice and intimate for dates and such.   The (owner/Manager/well dressed/bearded guy) was super awesome! He assisted my friend with her second drink order, they stayed true to the menu which states, \"don't see what you are looking for? Just let us know and we will do our darnedest to get it for you.\" They did just that! Creating some concoction from a bar in New York!   I really enjoyed the night! Food  drinksatmosphere  service  You are insane not to stop by when you are downtown! :)"}
{"text":"Bitter and twisted is a lot of fun- we came  here when visiting my brother in Phoenix. Great atmosphere and the menu is a little large but the wait staff were quick to recommend things that fit my favorite ingredients. We were told at the door that we would have a bit of a wait (we arrived around 7 PM on a Saturday) but the hostess sent us a text  when a table was ready and the wait ended up being relatively short. Overall very fun!"}
{"text":"Make sure you make a \"reservation\" as you are not allowed to \"stand\" in the bar area. Would have liked to enjoy a drink but the half empty establishment had too many reservations and due to their asinine no standing rule we were offered two choices 1) stand in the corner in time-out without a drink for an hour or 2) find someplace else to drink.  So we decided to walk across the street and find another bar that allowed standing. This isn't hard since most places in the world will allow you to stand and have a drink.  B&T must have a slamming anchor tenant deal because serving anywhere remotely close to their capacity is clearly not interesting.  Just remember \"Summer is coming...\" And you are going to need patrons.  Good luck!"}
{"text":"Clearly this place knows what's up. Their drink menu is outrageous and absolutely fantastic. I would have given it 5-stars, but my bartender was cocky. He certainly knows what he's doing (props to him for memorizing a menu that size), but a bit too confident for his own good. I thoroughly enjoyed my cocktail with mezcal paired with the best noodles I've ever had. Excellent place and I'll be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I closed down Bitter & Twisted on 5/14 for my Bachelor party, and what a way to end the night. Bitter and Twisted has, without a doubt, the best Mojito I can recall having in the state. I only feel bad about ordering so many of them (according to a bar tender that I read occasionally, it's one of the more labor intensive drinks to make). The atmosphere of the bar is second-to-none, is well decorated, with just the right amount of light and noise. Service was excellent, fast, and attentive. The menus? Honestly - who has menus that are worth talking about in a review?? Bitter and Twisted. That's who. I grew up in the 80s so it was a very welcome dose of familiarity and nostalgia.   For food, there wasn't much of it that we consumed. Basically a few orders of popcorn which was surprisingly excellent. My only regret of the evening is that we weren't early enough to really experience more of Bitter and Twisted's food and drink menu (although considering the amount of mojito's I had, in addition to libations consumed through the evening, this would probably have been a very bad idea).   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Exactly what downtown Phoenix needed, and a consistent great time. Ross and his team have created an atmosphere and experience that almost matches the quality of the 22 page drink menu! Zach and Paroose make you feel like you're at your local watering hole with their customer service and way of always remembering you're name and your favorite drink. The booze cupcakes that Lauren makes will change your life, if you can get there before they sell out. Best items on the menu; hurricane popcorn, Raman burger, lemongrass Colins and the old fashion! If you're coming from old town Scottsdale...you won't fit in. Douche bags not welcome."}
{"text":"Finally made it back to this place a couple weeks ago.  Drinks are still amazing but this time we made sure to come in for Happy Hour and get some food.  We were not disappointed there either.  The Mac N Cheese was creamy, smoky and downright awesome.  The taco's have a bit of a kick for my wife but were perfect for me.  Definitely nibble on the grilled cheese bites. Desert was the Campfire Marshmallows, better known as a sugar bomb sure to put you in shock.  Very good but way too much for just the two of us.  But don't forget, you are really there for the drinks and they are incredible.  The bartenders (mixologists), are fun and creative using fresh in house ingredients and premium liquors.  My only problem is that it's downtown and so far away which means a downtown hotel for the night because there is no way I am going to be the DD if we are stopping here and its never just for one."}
{"text":"They have one of the best happy hours in the state!  They have a Cheescake factory menu of amazing alcoholic drinks and is smack dab in the middle of Downtown Phoenix.  If drinking is your think I highly recommend you check out Bitter & Twisted, but if you want to eat some grub you have to try out the Dumpling and Ramen Burger.  My favorite is the Ramen Burger.  The burger is nice and juicy and you get the amazing crunch of the Ramen.  Oh man, you are on another level of awesome when you bite into that Ramen Burger.  Be sure to add this to your list of places to go!  BrandonFitFoodie"}
{"text":"I've been to B&T a couple times now and I'm definitely a fan.  The drinks and the food have attention to detail that I really appreciate.  Its the same three bartenders pretty much every day (Tues through Sunday, I think?) and they know how to make drinks.  Fresh ingredients, quality spirits, properly proportioned and mixed.  They have a feature cocktail of the week, which is usually at a special price.  They do happy hour every day, with drinks and food on special.  I've had the potatoes twice and will admit it would be difficult to go here and not order them.  My only complaint is that they're not salted, so I have to ask for salt.  But the spicy pepper sauce, avocado chunks and pesto is a killer combo.  My bf had their noodle dish and couldn't eat it fast enough he liked it so much.  Some friends shared the tacos and gave them good reviews as well.  this place also has a \"secret\" menu.  I believe they are redoing their food menu entirely and moving some of the secret items into permanent rotation... Grilled cheese bites anyone??"}
{"text":"Had a lot of fun here! Cozy, a touch of hipster, old-school and modern somehow all rolled into one place. A good atmosphere to sip a cocktail and socialize. On our visit, we ended up sitting at the bar since it was getting on the verge of crowded. The drink menu was a bit daunting so we asked the bartender for a recommendation. He handed us a menu that had popular drinks listed on it. He didn't seem too interested in making conversation, but he had mad skills and I ended up with one of the best old-fashioned drinks I've ever had! Prices are fair for the quality of drink you receive. Food wise we settled on sharing the brisket tacos. Superb tasting but the portion size was pretty small (three mini size tacos for $8). It seems like drinks are their main appeal so keep that in mind if you have a big appetite. On the whole, glad we checked this place out and I would definitely be game for coming back!"}
{"text":"Great drinks, amazing variety Our server knew the drink menu inside and out & was able to give Recs that suited each of our taste (12 of us!) Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night. The hostess was wicked rude to me and my friend but the bartenders were nice! The guy with the dark hair and beard was sweet and makes great drinks. I'd sit on his face"}
{"text":"2nd time here 1st first time never actually happened because this is a 21 and over establishment  even if you just want to come and try the food.  The reason I gave them a 4 star was due to the price. Even during Happy Hours I feel as if it's a little pricey but it was well worth it.  Food: Ramen Burger was awesome first time I've ever tried it so hard to compare it to any other ramen burger but my brother said it was better than the one he had in a food truck. Definitely try it out we split the burger into 4 and share amongst of group.  Hurricane Popcorn - I'm not to crazy about popcorn unless it's the Smart food White Cheddar but there's something about these popcorn that keeps making me stick my fingers back in there.  Green Chili Mac was so good and cheesy with a tiny kick of jalepeno. This was one of my favorite. Yum Yum Noodles was also one of my fave there. It reminds me of a chow mein stir fry with flavor.   As for drinks between the 4 of us we had roughly 3 rds of mixed drink each. I don't remember what I had but I recommend sticking to their top 10 list they have since it's customers most pick/ordered drinks. I find that the drinks there are mixed to perfection. Not like your typical bar that just eyeball everything just to get you out of their hair."}
{"text":"Unique cocktail bar that has an incredibly clever beverage menu longer than a children's picture book. The setup of the menu is cute in the way that it takes you on an adventure with multiple themes. The drinks are delectable but are all $12+. They keep the food interesting here featuring a ramen burger. Quite delicious but not a large portion. Overall this is a great happy hour place that's a perfect fit when you're feeling a fun drink or two."}
{"text":"I have to give this spot 5 stars, everything from the doorman to of course,  the food and the very creative drinks menu. I truly enjoyed the fact to made sure to not over crowd the spot with their waitlist. We had 3 different drinks (High Society, lemoncello, Lime & Coconut ) and the pork belly tacos and  noodles; all were great."}
{"text":"Beautiful spot, looks great, but the noise level is extreme. Friday early (6:45) the place was busy, however we were seated right away. Drink menu is extreme!, lots of great sounding things to try. Server was a bit short with us , and I thought food & drinks took a long time getting to the table. I ordered a salad & the menu did not mention cucumbers. I'm allergic to cucumbers & had to send it back, so my husband ate (mac & Cheese, yummy!) while I waited 10 minutes for a new salad, which was really tasty. The whole experience left me wrong. Don't think we'll be back. Food was good, atmosphere not to my taste, maybe I'm too old, but I don't like to have to yell across the table, & ask the server to repeat herself."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! They have a whole menu of drinks that tell you which drinks are \"safe\" and which ones you should \"probably call uber for\". They even have a section for \"Yelper of the week\" on their huge wall menu and they put a segment of a review from Yelpers that \"diss\" the restaurant. I find it perfectly entertaining and I'm not really sure why people would write bad reviews since this place is amazing! I loved their Mojito and Happy Hour food (lettuce wraps= 10 stars)! Can't wait to go back soon."}
{"text":"Talk about a new years eve deal! I'm almost nervous to shout it out because we want to go back next year!  this is an old school, but now....quite hipster cocktail bar. a sit down bar, you won't find it packed with pointy shoe'd men trying the latest lines on every chick in the bar. you might find handlebar mustaches, suspenders, and horn-rimmed glasses. for sure though, you will find an enormous amount of cocktails.   we reserved on-line for a booth for NYE. no waiting in a long line, we were seated at our comfy booth with our party companions. a bottle of champagne awaited us, as well as 2 enormous bowls of delicious spicy popcorn.   we were allowed 2 appetizers which were so big, were more like entree plates. i had the ramen noodle dish (love ramen, and this is cooked quite the opposite of your college ramen). spicy and sweet. the wife had the mac n cheese. it was enough for 3 people! and delicious.   service was absolutely spotless. after we downed our 2 bottles of champagne, we ordered a few drinks off the menu. all tasty but buzz inducing without the overwhelming taste of alcohol.   i really liked this place, not only for the menu but for the ambiance. great night out and thanks Bitter and Twisted."}
{"text":"Stopped by for my first time at bitter and twisted yesterday. My wife and I showed up around 5pm on a Saturday and this place was already packed! We were lucky to get seated right away but by the time we left there was a wait out the door. The ambiance was really cool. It almost had a speakeasy feel. They have a huge drink program with many options. I got Hendricks and cucumber which was really flavorful but I think it could have used some more gin. My wife and I split the fish and chips and the fried chicken dish. Both were delicious. The chicken was moist and fried perfectly. I really enjoyed the watermelon kimchi and the hot sauce they paired the chicken with. Fish and chips was probably one of the best I've had. They gave you 3 big pieces of fish and the breading was crispy and the cod was flaky. The tartar sauce had a nice balance of flavor. Overall, the food was wonderful and the drinks that we ordered were just okay. I will be back to try some of their other menu items and maybe come back to try a new drink. Great downtown location too! This place can definitely get busy though especially if some games are going on in downtown. Great service!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best hidden gem in phoenix. We walked past it and asked ourselves \"is this place even open?\" But yes it was!! Inside it was lively and fun. I'm not a cocktail person, wino to the core, but I tried the Strawberry Sundae, Tiramisu, and Collerane?? Cooler. So yummy. We will definitely be back. We sat at the bar and enjoyed every minute."}
{"text":"Great drinks - wonderful atmosphere.  Still new so service is a little slow.  The 24-page cocktail menu is very impressive and it's hard to pick what you want to try first.  Very high energy with a bit of a 1920's nightclub feel.  I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Drinks and food were great!! I had blackberry mojito on the hh menu and it was as good as it could have been, gf got a pear margarita which was also good as it could have been. The typhoon chicken was amazing perfect flavors of all items separate and even better combined. The dumpling burger was crazy tasted hust like an authentic chinese dumpling. This was a great meal perfect followed by their play on smores . 5stars all around this place rocks!!!!"}
{"text":"Cool vibe, great music, and awesome drinks! I had the Lovefruit Medley which is made with their homemade watermelon vodka .. Holy smokes amazing!"}
{"text":"Full throttle bartending, and a cocktail menu that respects the classics as well as innovation."}
{"text":"This place is great! I recommend sitting at the bar and watching what the bar tender makes for you. My wife and I both told the bartender what we like and he made us a special drink. We'll absolutely be back soon!"}
{"text":"I had the Vesper... It looks like a glass of vodka with a lemon peel in it but it's delicious... You wait for the nasty kick of vodka and it never happens. Delightful. The red leather booths are sexy too, I could see myself getting pretty tipsy and wanting to jump my dates' bones in here.... But I'm with my sis so I need to settle down"}
{"text":"We made an attempt to come here on opening night, which was a big waste of time...however we were not disappointed on our second try. The happy hour prices are great, offsetting the cost of some of the higher priced concoctions. There is something for everyone on this menu, just ask for a recommendation if you can't decide. The old Fashioned was delicious along with a few other drinks we ordered. We also ordered this corn and cheese dip which was unique, fresh and quite yummy. Too many chips and not enough dip was my one and only snag. I guess the chef thought the dip was taking too long so he sent out the glass noodles with cuttlefish.on the house! Sounds weird and looks weird, but amazing! Service was excellent. Beth, our server, was very helpful, attentive and fun! Nice work Bitter & Twisted for making our second visit a success."}
{"text":"Arrived here on the eve of the New Year. 'Twas not too bitter, and delightfully twisted."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in last night as I had read a food critic review and it prompted me to look up the menu.  They have a lot of unique foods and I can't wait to go back and try some others.  We had the ramen burger and the dragon dumpling burger and shared - they were both awesome! My only complaint with them would be that we ordered them medium and they were definitely well done, but still juicy and not dried out.  The specialty drink menu is huge and I would love to go back and try something new.  The price point is a little high but I am willing to pay more for the creativity. The waitress was very attentive and the bar has an overall fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Amazing drinks and small plates!   It's a nice place to hang out with friends after work or on weekends, though it does get crowded. Most of the things I have tried here haven't disappointed me but the two things I love the most is their big ice cubes in their drinks which don't water down the drink quickly and their Green Chili Mac, chili adds a lovely kick to the Mac and cheese.   P.S. I wish they sold their popcorns in big holiday bins. I could have loads of their popcorn on movie nights. The wasabi crackers on the pop corn are such an unexpected twist."}
{"text":"Cool place - loved the decor and the drink menu. The drinks were unique and very tasty. We had a bunch of happy hour small plates which were also good, although a little unusual. It was like Mexican/Asian fusion - not BAD, just unusual. :) That said we all enjoyed taking little bits off each plate. Would go back again if I was in the area but probably just for drinks since that seems to be their real specialty!"}
{"text":"The bartenders are artists and anyone that can concoct a perfect Aviation is gold in my book. Great atmosphere and solid food options. I didn't get to try the Bourbon Cupcake (they were sold out) I'm told Tuesday is the day to get them Will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"ONE STAR!!! Just kidding. 5 stars, but missed Brian. Love this place and the ever changing menu. They always keep things interesting while keeping things consistent for regulars."}
{"text":"This place will do well.  Warning, currently it is mobbed by downtown hipsters and lawyers.  I've heard complaints from people about the wait for a cocktail.  What they don't seem to realize is that this place specializes in craft cocktails, so the idea is that each cocktail will be a bit of a wait.  If you like, you can put your name on a list, and wander around a bit in the 115 degree heat and they will text you when the table is ready.  The food is hit or miss.  I like the cheese plate but the components are less harmonious than usual:  ham spread, chocolate covered corn nuts, a pear that I think is poached in wasabi, a hard cheese and a soft one with some charcuterie.  The short ribs remind me of sweet and sour pork in a good way.   Deep fried covered in a vinegary sugary sauce.  I didn't care for the panda tacos.  They didn't contain pandas.  What it did contain was peanuts, fried anchovies and chilis.  You then wrap them in a lettuce leaf with jalepenos and pineapple slices.  Cute but when I want a taco, I want a taco.  Or some vegetables, not necessarily peanuts.  This is a welcome addition to the down town scene, I have a feeling that I will be there quite often.  Although probably on expense account time, it's a little spendy with cocktails generally in the 14 dollar range.  Classic cocktails are about 10, with the option of upgrading them to a higher price point with better liquor.  The menu is expansive, something like 24 pages and probably hard to read if you are above the age of 30 and have bad eyesight.  The bar tenders will steer you in the right direction though if you are lost."}
{"text":"My first Singapore Sling!  Had a great time at this cocktail bar.  The menu is, frankly, daunting.  But if you go with someone who's familiar, and take cues from your server, you're going to be alright.  Resign yourself to the fact that you're going to have to become a repeat customer, to really appreciate all the cocktails this bar has to offer.  Luckily, the food is great as well.  I had the Charcuterie Board.  Some really exceptional cheese selections. The sauces were great as well. Only downside?  Not much to offer in the way of veggie choices.  Would be nice to be able to order come cucumber or something.  But all in all, extremely good food.  This will go on my list of places that I *must* visit when I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Love this place. You can't really go wrong with food or drink here. So many drink options! Drinks can be really strong so be prepared! Last time I had the typhoon chicken and sampled a bite of the green chile Mac. Both amazing. Have the best olive martinis in my opinion."}
{"text":"Hands down the best muthafuckin bar in Phoenix!  All around five stars!  Service, food, cleanliness, decor, COCKTAILS... the cocktails are phenomenal.  I've been here twice already in the one week I've known of its existence - both times were a great experience.  The menu is obviously well thought out and the cocktail descriptions make is so difficult to settle on just one... so you can't... you have to settle on at least five and then call Uber to come get you.    I love the bartender/owner!  He is so genuinely grateful for the customers that come to his place.  He also has an awesome Scottish accent and it doesn't matter what is coming out of his mouth, it just sounds awesome.  Seems to me this guy could have opened up shop anywhere but he chose Phoenix and I thank him for that, we were in desperate need of a place like this."}
{"text":"The food is inventive and tasty.  The cocktail menu is the equivalent of the Cheesecake Factory in booze form.  Page after page of cocktails - and nothing made exceptionally well.  Service is spotty.  Depends on who you get.  It's a space that downtown Phoenix needs - but I wish it was better."}
{"text":"Amazing drinks! Nice, strong and smooth. The alcohol filled cupcake was great. The banana dessert was great. Even the korean tacos were great. Loved it."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town - this place is a must. Great cocktails and food. Get the chicken or the lettuce wraps."}
{"text":"My client recommended this place to me and I'm so glad I gave it a try. The atmosphere was awesome and the decoration was great. They had a great choice of music. Seating was comfortable and they had spacious walkways.   We ordered the popcorn, ramen burger, dumpling burger, Korean nachos, the pork bao buns, and a salad. Everything we ordered was absolutely delicious!!! My favorite was the popcorn, it is so addicting. The presentation of the beverages were so unique. Our favorite was the \"duck bath punch\". It came out in a small bathtub with two cute ducks on each side. They even have tiny bubbles on the inside. Great job with the way this one was presented!!   We had so much fun that night and we are definitely coming back here more often!!!"}
{"text":"Tim is a great bartender and their food doesn't dissapoint. They have the best meat and cheese board around. The fresh burrata was amazing! Their extensive and unique cocktail experience is great for dates, or a unique place to bring unfamiliar friends. Strongly recommend."}
{"text":"We all were headed to the suns game, and I reluctantly came across this diamond.  We popped in with little to no wait. The seating arrangement is comfortable and they have a very well kept bar area.   We had to catch the game in 1 hour so we just had some apps .. To start we did a meat plate and some of the popcorn I heard about...And I will say as a 4 person group. We all enjoyed the food. The meat plate had a good simple layout. 2 meats 2 cheeses and some accoutrements with bread and olives. The popcorn had this wasabi type of kick to it. #willorderagain   All four of us did different drinks but with my girls blackberry Mojito, and my creative bear concoction with gin were absolutely freaking fantastic.   The service was above par, our server was perfect on timing and communication. Tip well deserved:) we will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Great cocktails from a crack team of bartenders, and a fantastic bar set up.  Looking forward to my return!"}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Roger Daltrey - Bitter And Twisted)  I can try to Bo Bites it I can think whatever I like I can try to better you Cause I\"m hungry and ready to eat  All my life I've tried new drinks Never tired and never resisted And now I'm Yelping all the time All I ever want is Bitter & Twisted  Bitter, Twisted, Bitter Twisted twisted Bitter, Twisted, Bitter Twisted twisted  Bitter & Twisted is a cool little cocktail spot located in the heart of Phoenix.  The place itself reminds me of a New York uptown swanky bar.  Trendy and welcoming once you walk right in.  We sat at the booth side of the restaurant.    My partner ordered a Whiskey straight up, while I went with a Whiskey Berry Jubilee.  The cocktail menu reads like a book; literally!  In the back page they have a guide or gauge I guess I should call it; to let you know what drink to order based on how you feel for the night.  In the end, I thought the drink menu is interesting, but definitely too big.  Think Cheesecake Factory menu....  For food, we order The Kraken, charred cuttlefish, with glass noodles, thai basil, and crispy shallots and the Angry Panda Tacos, sichuan chili, jalapenos, charred peanuts, crispy anchovies, scallions, pineapples and mint.  Seems like a lot to say, but the Panda tacos worked well. Spicy, sweet and minty with a crunch from the peanuts, very refreshing bite.  I didn't really care for the Kraken; just didn't take like much plus the cuttlefish was to big and chunky.    Overall an okay experience.  Service was decent, but the place is a cool just for chilling. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Gave this place another try only due to friends we were out with who encouraged us to try again. I was open minded and hopeful that our second time around would be better - but unfortunately it wasn't. The same rude guy was at the door and demonstrated the same rude behavior (judging us based on looks and saying we couldn't come in). They don't have to give a reason to turn you away, they can just say you aren't welcome. If you question their judgement they just become even more rude!!!  The place obviously gets a lot of business because there is a line to get in each time we have gone (or walked by) but not sure how when they cast such judgement on people. They don't allow standing in their bar area, it's seating only. Who ever heard of a bar like that?   I'm really shocked at the number of positive reviews this place gets, they must be paying people or something. Go to Copper Blues across the street. The drinks are great and the staff is nice and respectful!"}
{"text":"tl;dr -- It's a restaurant, not a bar, with an extensive cocktail selection, but pretty boring otherwise.  It's quite hard to simply define what B&T is, so buckle up and prepare for quite the lengthy review. Nestled between Cityscape and a light rail track, it has guaranteed traffic, and an endless supply of Gen X-ers too square for the more artsy or happenin' locales. Everything about your experience is calculated so meticulously I am not yet convinced the owner is human, but rather an automaton programmed to run an establishment that's aesthetically pleasing but bereft of all character. It just feels that cold.   For starters, there's an iPad-wielding doorman behind a labyrinth of rope to estimate your wait time, and additional hosting staff in the curtained foyer. They will double-check that you are indeed allowed inside. I have had contact with fewer people before boarding a flight. Once you're in, there are several seating options ranging from the good ol' bar stool to tables for six, booths, and comfy couches. It is quite controversial that the head honcho, Ross, does not allow standing. I can understand and respect the virtue of enforcing this to maintain the integrity of his vision for a comfortable experience. But at the same time, the setup is wholly antisocial. It's not like a lounge in which you can merge seating to mingle with another group over some groovy tunes. It's all very rigid. You will stay put and have the experience you were meant to have. All with a playlist that sounds like Snow Patrol radio on Pandora.  Service is as attentive as it is impersonal...you will never wait more than several moments to have your next order taken, but you will never see a server for more than a half minute. They are consistently hurried. Unless you're at the bar...then they can let loose. A little bit.   I have found the dining options to be lackluster and gimmicky, seemingly constructed by basic undergrads who studied abroad once and totally want you to try this one cool fast food item previously unavailable stateside. Their take on anglicized curried chips is a welcome novelty for those who have not ventured to a culinary scene that isn't dominated by Latin flair. Unfortunately, it manages to be even more bland than a foray to Western European pubs who are better (worse?) at bastardizing cuisine than yanks. A different small plate, the \"Seoul Fried Chicken\" was intriguing on paper, and I have a mild appreciation for the creativity even after giving it a try. Mostly because of the pickled watermelon \"kimchi\". Unfortunately, the chicken itself was so tough and heavily breaded I might have believed it was simply delivered from the nearest Popeye's. It was rendered nearly impenetrable by my fork. I am mostly done with the food here. Someone may sigh and say I need to try their signature item, the ramen burger. But...how is a *burger* the go-to dish when juxtaposed with a drink menu boasting unparalleled depth?   I feel as though I may soon reach the character limit here, so allow me to administer some praise for the drinks. They are well-thought, and in many ways, well-executed. Your mint will be perfectly muddled, so you can go with the julep, but there are some unorthodox gems to be found as well. I am a big fan of the Corpse Reviver, a delicious gin-absinthe (my two favorite liquors) blend. Otherwise, I have given staff free reign to make whatever they want, and while I am pleased with their mastery of ingredient selection (detecting floral, citrus notes), I have noticed one disappointing motif: Weakness in every beverage. I don't want cocktails to absolutely destroy me by virtue of being downright difficult to consume. On the other hand, I don't want the sugary stuff from T.G.I.ChiliBee's that would pass for an alcopop in a blind taste test. B&T lands a smidgen toward the latter, whereas the ideal solution should be both flavorful and more easily sipped than chugged. The inability to distinguish this forces me to drop a star, the first deduction having been made for not knowing how to be fun.   This fills a niche in my downtown routine, as I have common cravings for new cocktails...but after one or two I'd much rather continue my night on the town elsewhere. Give it a try."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about how fabulous my experience at Bitter & Twisted was. I've lived in Phoenix my entire life and there are very few unique and high-quality craft cocktail bars. How many places do you know that make their own syrups and pay so much attention to the quality of the ice in the drink? Not many. The menu is laid out like a story book and reminded me of my childhood... Wait, your childhood didn't involve booze?! The servers are always quick to recommend something based on your individual tastes, and I've never been steered wrong. As a heads up, this place is incredibly popular and often has waits even when they first open. It's best to try and make a reservation or be willing to wait your turn. That being said, it's definitely worth the wait!"}

{"text":"Stopped by with family and had a good time. Our waitress was attentive and friendly. The establishment was pumping out the Friday night business and had a nice feel. The food and drinks though were just okay in my book and pricey. The Hendricks drink with gin, club soda, and cucumbers was damn good but like them all, pricey. For dinner we rolled with the meat and cheese board, Raman burger, yum yum noodles with pork belly, and their mac and cheese. The m and c board was tasty and a great appetizer. The Raman burger was way too salty and just okay and the noodles were flavorful but there was little to no pork belly mixed in.  Really disappointing given my love for pork. The real winner though was the mac and cheese. It was so good and I could eat it again and again. Overall, nice night with family and there was nothing horrible about our dining experience. Will have to give the place another try."}
{"text":"Of all my worldly travels, this place is by far one of my faves!!! The service was great, the wait staff is engaging, the drink selection is top notch!!! And, they have a couch.  Bars with couches, are my top choice. And the couch here is not sticky!"}
{"text":"Seriously in love with this place and I have been here way too many times since it opened. GREAT atmosphere, the food is delicious-seriously, the Seoul Fried Chicken??? The smashed chips??? Tsukemen Ramen and the Barbecue Pork Calentado? All SO DAMN good!  Their cocktails are great too. Their drink menu is something to behold-check out the \"Cocktail Map\" at the back to chart the best drink for you. I could down Classic Collins all night because they are so refreshing. The Solero is like a passion fruit 50/50 bar. You can't go wrong with a blackberry mojito. So many options so little time and money!  The atmosphere awesome, they place good music. I really had my doubts when the opening of this place was announced. As much as I support downtown Phoenix, I was convinced that Bitter & Twisted was going to be lame and suck ass. I could not have been more wrong. I can't believe that downtown has something this cool. Don't get me wrong, we all love Blue Hound but this is a worthy counterpart to give downtown more of a  desperately needed coolness vibe.  The ONLY negative is that they put WAY too much ice in their drinks to the point that I don't feel I'm getting best value for money. So they really deserve 4.5 stars but I love the place so much that that is not going to stop me from coming back again and again and again. You can't go wrong with drinks or the food and that's a rarity. I highly recommend coming in and showing these guys some love."}
{"text":"Excellent, excellent, excellent cocktails!!  Thoughtful and well-crafted. I doubt there is a bad cocktail on the menu and I hope to visit many times again to try more. The shear number of options is a bit overwhelming but the server was knowledgeable and made great recommendations.  The food was solid. I was talked into the Korean nachos by my friend and our server and was glad we ordered it. The smashed chips which were just on the edge of too spicy. They only 'problem' was the serving was too big to finish."}
{"text":"Their drinks were too strong. No one could drink them. Portions too small. (Except for the fish & chips and yum yum noodles). So sad that this place didn't work out. I was looking forward to it."}
{"text":"Fantastic place, great drink menu, was VERY surprised that they have Pisco, to make Pisco Sours, they have great food, bartenders are very friendly and helpful at making a drink for someone that wants a surprise. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"11:30 in the PM. All I wanted outta life was a \"/:;()$&@ hamburger. Kitchen can't make a burger after 11:30PM. Dumb."}
{"text":"We went here on Friday night for my dad's birthday..unfortunately we ended up leaving due to the fact that parking was hard to find for the rest of our party so we went back to my parents hotel. Awesome staff, very attentive and friendly . They have amazing drinks too. However their food leaves something to be desired. we got the fried chips, typhoons chicken, and the pork. All of these were horrible. To be honest. Very salty, not a good mix of flavors. We also had the popcorn which was amazing. We all did get sick to our stomach that night and onto the weekend. Not a fun time with that. I say HOORAY for the drinks, seven thumbs down for the food!"}
{"text":"Fantastic spot. Came highly recommended and it lived up to the hype. Got there and put myself on the Yelp waitlist and only had to wait 20 minutes.   We sat at the bar and had incredible bartenders who weren't pushy but definitely knowledgeable of their cocktails.   The menu is overwhelming but fun to read through. We chose the Lemongrass Collins and Old Fashioned to start.   Can we just talk about my Lemongrass Collins?! Woah. I've never had anything like it. It wasn't overly boozy or sweet. Every sip was a sip of heaven.   Hubs said the Old Fashioned was well done!  We ordered the Dragon Dumpling Burger and Chish and Fips. Their menu has an Asian flare and they've nailed the food. Took a bite of the burger and it tasted just like a dumpling!   The cod had a great batter and so well flavored that I didn't even need to use the malt vinegar. The slaw and the tartar sauce were something special for sure.   What a wonderful place. Not pretentious even though I initially thought so when they had a doorman with a headset and there was a wait. But now I get it. They don't want you to feel like you're in a crowded space.   5 star worthy!"}
{"text":"This place is top notch! If you are looking for a fun, hip, creative and all around cool place for some pre or post dinner drinks, this is the place. If you want drinks choices you've never even thought of, this is the place. It's within walking distance of so many great dinner places. But it's also a fantastic place if all you want are some drinks and delicious appetizers! Give this place a try. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Thank you for a delicious gin fizz. It was my first I've had and it did not disappoint. The bartender was quite the mixologist. He was definitely indifferent towards us but I did ask a lot of questions. I tried 3 cocktails and had the Yum Yum noodles. Get them with the pork belly. It's phenomenal. I would not suggest the #1 on the first page of the drink list. (Something \"queen\"?) it's an unnecessary snow cone to make the bartender execute. And it made a mess everywhere. My favorite drink so far is the slap and tickle. My personal opinion? You missed an opportunity to name that cocktail the \"Slap and Pickle\" somebody would have got that reference. All in all, you may not be the bartenders favorite person in the world but he's still killing it on the drinks and the food will exceed your expectations for dining in Phoenix. It absolutely rivals everyone else that thinks they're doing it right. They're ahead of the game."}
{"text":"This place is simply wonderful. If you like well crafted cocktails, and aren't timid about paying a little more for a genuine expertly crafted adult beverage, this is your place.  It definitely gets a little on the busier side on Friday and Saturday nights - so be prepared to wait. Unfortunately, there isn't standing room, but this isn't exactly the type of place where you'd want to be standing while chugging down a crappy vodka soda anyways.  I typically go with one of two classics - a vodka martini or an old fashioned. Both are probably of the better variations of those drinks that I've had. The martini I remember being very smooth (which is not always the case if they're using shitty vodka or if it isn't mixed well). The old fashioned is truly a treat. Well mixed without being overly sweet. Perfection!  I'm told they have awesome booze infused cupcakes too - they must be great because every time I'm in they're always sold out!  Places like this are making me really enjoy the downtown revival that's been happening of late. This little speakeasy off the beaten path is definitely worth a stop.  Disclaimer: the positive nature of this review was in no way, shape, or form prompted by the threat of being the disgruntled Yelper of the week on their specials board. Promise."}
{"text":"Hey BARTENDER! #bestbartenderever You MUST come visit Brian! He will either make one of the more than 100 drinks chosen from the menu, or create one just for you based upon your tastes. First time here, easy to find and only for people who know their ass from their elbow. Will definitely be returning to this beautiful establishment."}
{"text":"Came here to meet clientele out for a drink. Bartending staff is definitely cool. They make the Moscow Mule I like quite well. They also have a to-go menu which, was awesome. Prices are are what you would expect considering the downtown prestige, lol. Ambiance is nice and the place is clean with nice art deco stuff hanging everywhere. Parking is shitty since it's downtown and you've gotta shell out moolah for any spot that's decent. I usually get valet. Other than that, it's near all the action downtown."}
{"text":"The drinks were absolutely divine and orgasmic. However the coleslaw with my Chish and fips was the exact opposite of orgasmic. Thank god for the porn star martini. I was still able to swallow.."}
{"text":"My sweetheart and I went to this place on opening evening  and it was pretty packed. We didn't really find seating so we stood at the bar. We really enjoyed the atmosphere. Let me mention, I'm a beer drinker and not necessarily a spirits drinker. That being said I really liked my Te-kill-ya drinks. I had Tequila Mocking Bird,($11.00) and La Reposado ($12.00). Both were pretty damn good. I especially liked the La Reposado. My sweetheart told the bartender she liked sweeter drinks. The bartender recommended a Market Mojito ($9.00). It didn't agree with her so she sipped it ever so slowly. This is when my only real concern took place. The bartender asked her how her drink was, which she replied it wasn't for her. At which time the bartender insisted on making her another drink. Though my sweets insisted on not having another drink the bartender insisted on making her a drink anyway. Now, It's been my experience, when a bartender insists on making you another drink to make up for the drink they recommended that drink is usually comped. At the end of the night when we received our check, We wounded up paying for the drink. Oh well, a little misunderstanding.  I've seen enough of Bar Rescue to know opening night usually come with some glitches so I wont be to judgmental on service time. Overall, I really liked this place. I would definitely come back for more. The spirits were good quality and I feel you definitely get your moneys worth. I recommend this place and Kudos for having this business Downtown. I love that."}
{"text":"Phoenix waited til I moved away to build this place.  Fuck you, Phoenix.  Now I have to come back."}
{"text":"UPDATE: I got a very thoughtful reply from a staff member on my review suggesting that my unfortunate interaction with a staffer was probably not representative of how things go down overall, even in the cases a bartender feels compelled to make a cautionary note on a requested substitution. AND SO! I am going to happily eat crow and update my review to reflect my experience suppressing memory of that negative interaction. See ya soon, B&T. Let's have Scotch next time.  What's quick and dirty on Bitter & Twisted? The drinks are good and fairly priced, the liquor selection is great, and the barstools are above-average comfortable. I had three drinks, two off the menu, and then for the last one I just asked the bartender to make something he thought sounded good. They were all really good! You kinda get the vibe that the place takes itself a bit too seriously, but don't we all in our own way?  I didn't have one, but the Long Island comes in a can, which is pretty cool imho.   ~~~~~~~~~~  So like, I predicted that the reviews on this place would be largely positive with a few really negative reviews from people complaining about rude staff. Guess how I guessed that?  Lemme tell you what had happened...  My body hates rye. If I consume rye-based alcohols, I break out in hives, my body temperature increases a lot, I get far more intoxicated than I should for the amount consumed, and no one has a good time. Especially not me the morning after when my bowel decides to just murder me from the inside. That said, it seems pretty unique to rye. I can drink bourbon, whiskey, Scotch and have a great time.   So, I go here with my buddy after catching David Sedaris at the Orpheum, as one does. I naturally want to try the Sazerac, but I ask the bartender if he can make it with bourbon instead of rye whiskey because \"my body has a really weird reaction, and I break out in hives. It's suuuuuuuper lame.\" At this point, I'm jovial. Playful. Kittenish.  The look I got? Ew. And then in a mildly condescending tone, I got a wee sermon on \"the intention\" of the cocktail and how I shouldn't be disappointed if I mess with the recipe and don't like it.   Dudebro, I did NOT just ask you to make me a Vesper with Absolut Vanilla. Calm yourself down. But also, you think I'm just guessing I have a serious inflammatory reaction to rye? You think I'm just shooting in the dark on that? Did you listen to me when I said what I said to you?  I get it. You worked really hard to come up with these recipes. You're not a bartender, you're a purveyor of fine cocktails, and you like your menu so much you put an ISBN on it.   But like, I just told you I have a negative physiological reaction to an ingredient, and more importantly you did not invent the Sazerac, and let's just talk about that for a second. The Sazerac is a cocktail that was originally made with (and named for) a brand of Cognac and is the official cocktail of New Orleans. Since that time, it has commonly been made with rye and bourbon whiskey as a base, and people have even played with swapping Absinthe for Herbsaint, which is also produced by the Sazerac Company. A bourbon-based Sazerac is not blasphemy. It's part of the drink's history. If you wanna claim purity, make the damn thing with cognac.  I don't care if you acted the way you did because you weren't listening or if you are just that invested in your vision for these drinks (which I turn into pee, by the way). But as a matter of principle, don't tell a customer her health comes at the expense of your artistry."}
{"text":"Love this place. We had a girls night out and we couldn't be happier with our meals and drinks. The ambiance and menus were outstanding. Everything was clean and the service was great. I was a little disappointed about the portion sizes, but it was worth it. Pricing is good for the kind of classy restaurant it is.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Fantastic atmosphere. Huge selection of cocktails. We will certainly be back in the future!"}
{"text":"Tim is the best!! This whole place blew me away. Superb drinks and knowledgeable bar men with great attitudes"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible service! I had the rudest waitress and when I asked to speak with the manager I got some assistant manager and she wasn't much better. No one was apologetic for their behavior and the way the treated me and my guests. We will never go back because of this experience I wish this place had a more responsible hiring process because I love the drink and location. Blue Hound is a suitable replacement as well as Valley Bar. Shame on them for treating their customers with so little respect!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place by chance... Well, really it was fate. The atmosphere is pure perfection, the employees are friendly, the food is divine and the drinks are heaven in the form of art. I don't know of any place like this, it's one of a kind and a pure treasure. If I was a pirate looking for treasure, the x that marks the spot would lead me here."}
{"text":"The drinks here are really good. The drink menu is very diverse and the bartenders are always willing to help choose a drink or make something that will be good for you. But none of the bartenders are hot."}
{"text":"The drinks and food were amazing!! I got the whiskey berry jubilee and my hubs got the manhattan. Sooo good. Brisket tacos were amazing as well"}
{"text":"I made it to the bar seconds before the end of happy hour and was greeted with... sure take your time .. it will be happy hour for you.  (Great service). Portions were big on all the appetizers we ordered and the food was fresh and delicious.  Drinks.... we ordered many as we couldn't decide on just one and what a great idea as the were wonderfully crafted...   if you want to enjoy your evening, come and make it happen."}
{"text":"A friend and I made an impromptu trip downtown Phoenix to check out City Scape before they took down the Christmas tree and ice rink and afterwards I suggested we head on over to Bitter & Twisted.  It was around 9ish on a Saturday night, it was a busy night out in Phoenix so there was a short wait, but cool thing was if you are logged into your Yelp app it tells you exactly how many people are head of you and your apx wait time. We were in within 10 minutes.  I had a bit of sweet tooth so I went with a tiramisu martini and some campfire marshmallows.  The campfire marshmallows are house made marshmallows on graham cracker sticks and come with a bowl melted chocolate, oh sweet messy heaven! So good! The tiramisu martini was pretty and tasted great too!  So glad we stopped at Bitter & Twisted, look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Their cocktails are fantastic. I am so excited to try more of their options because they have such a large variety. Their atmosphere is fantastic and very inviting. My one critique is that it does get very loud in here during the later hours of the evening. Enjoy this little gem in the heart of Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time  on a Friday night to grab a few cocktails.  This was a really cool place.  I love their drink menu and the venue itself has a great vibe to it for a night out. I would definitely recommend this place, if you're looking for a place to just lounge over a few drinks and socialize.  It reminded me a little bit of a nightlife similar to one of Chicago's cocktail lounge scene."}
{"text":"Felt like it's one of those places that people get so worked up about what's inside because it seems very high end, but once you are inside it's not really what you expect. Tough place to meet people at because you have to sit in whatever seat your places at(included bar). $34 for two drinks. Drinks were pretty damn good though."}
{"text":"A big group of about 8 of us stopped by on a Saturday night without a reservation. We were told the wait was about 90 minutes so we went to another bar to kill time. Luckily for us the wait was closer to under an hour. The atmosphere at this bar is smooth and sexy. It has dramatic furniture and dimmed lights, the perfect start or end to any Saturday night. The drinks and fun and creative. They have lots of drinks on the menu, it can be a little overwhelming for a first timer but the waitresses are pretty good at helping out in decision making. The food here is damn good! I recommend the Korean fried chicken, it's perfectly fried to perfection and great to snack on while sipping on some dranks!"}
{"text":"Great drinks, food and service.  Bartender gave excellent recommendations on food and drinks. Had some Tiki style drinks and one of the salads with added grilled shrimp."}
{"text":"Trendy downtown bar with excellent service, drinks and food!   One of my friends mentions this place at least every time I see him, so I was glad to try the place.  Seating was easy; we had five in our group, and we initially were seated at a high top table but later were moved elsewhere to fit another group.  The employee who moved us gave us some tasty little drinks after he moved us.   The service was outstanding on the busy Saturday evening I went. Servers came by multiple times, were friendly, helpful and efficient.     The drinks are interesting and unique and rather large.  I only tried the popcorn and enjoyed it. I didn't have anything else."}
{"text":"First time visitor. Walked in at 4:07 PM. Was greeted by Tim the bartender who not only was informative but kind and fun. Just what you want your bartender to be. Neat guy. The best drink menu in the valley. Atmosphere was cozy but high energy. A worthy experience. Unless you are a dick then not for you."}
{"text":"Such amazing cocktails AND food. this year I'm trying to get a different drink each time I go, since they have such an awesome selection, however it's pretty hard considering how well the do the classics! I would highly recommend checking out this spot."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the experience. The 100 year old building makes for a very neat environment. They offer an entire book on craft cocktails. So take your time and get something interesting. This isn't a bar that you can stand around at or just walk in. So Don't mind the door guy that will tell you it takes 30 minutes to get in... it will just takes about 10 minutes to get your seat or table."}
{"text":"Loved the ambiance and they have an extensive menu of unique cocktails! Can't wait to go back and try some different ones! So far my favorite is the lemongrass Collins. I also tried the banana caramel dessert there... so rich but delicious."}
{"text":"In my ~10 years of visiting Phoenix, 5 of which i've been legally allowed to drink, I've never once been to downtown Phoenix [minus going to a D'backs game in my high school age]. I was quite surprised at the sparsity of stuff to do around, and then all of a sudden a small bright light of hope around where Bitter & Twisted sits. Quite nice little hipster bar with quite strong drinks [they'll hit you when you least expect it]. Was a little disappointed in the small plates offering, but with a focus on drinks, it's expected. If you're hungry, get the Ramen Burger - holy hell is it delicious! I'd never had a non-burger burger before. Innovative place for an emerging downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"Came here after spotting this gem of a place while walking through CityScape on our way out.  We decided to come back for a date night the following Friday.  This place has the coolest atmosphere; I love dim lighting and this was great!  From the exposed brick to the huge wall of liquor at the bar and the super funny chalkboard that had a Yelp user review quote saying something along the lines of this place will never last.  That definitely provided a few laughs and made the atmosphere more relaxed and easy going, not that it wasn't already.  I loved that this business is housed in a historic building.  So charming!    To start, we ordered a house drink and an old-fashioned. I love love love how the bar tenders took their time making the drinks so they would be perfect.  They didn't rush to fill drinks and take money from customers as fast as they could, which was refreshing.  They actually seem to care about the craft and treat it as an art!  So great to witness.  The drinks, because of the care, came out incredible, probably the best old-fashioned (done the right way) that I've ever had at an establishment.  We ordered the meat and cheese board and of course, this was also amazing.  The server walked us through what everything on the board was, and after tasting it, I didn't care because it was so tasty!  We proceeded to ask the bartender what drinks he recommended and he went on to make us two custom drinks that weren't on the menu.  I'm kicking myself that I can't remember what they were because they were so dang good!  Just writing this review makes me want to go back right now!  We will definitely be back because we appreciate the time and care that went into our drinks and the attention to detail your establishment provided.  Well done!"}
{"text":"Finally found my favorite cocktail bar! After months of searching, this place has everything you could possibly imagine. The cozy couch is the perfect seating for a chilled date night. Our server was Barb and she was an absolute delight. It was so great to order a Pimm's Cup and not have someone look at you crazy and say pimp cup? It was very refreshing by the way. If you're looking for a place to kick back a few drinks and have some light bites in the late night, this is it! The popcorn is highly recommended! Hope you enjoy this place as much as we have!!"}
{"text":"I wish I were a fox so my love of your Chicken was more natural. The Kaiju fried chicken was awesome and now I am just typing more words so this qualifies as a review and not a tip."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been to this restaurant and it has been the worst service ever! I decided to give it another chance on Saturday and it will be the last time I'll be going back to this place. The host, waitress and MANAGEMENT are the worst; they are rude, and threatened my friends and I to kick us out. What a shame for such a cute spot, the employees have ruined that spot for us."}
{"text":"My wife and I came in for a couple of drinks before a concert because it looked like it would be a fun place from reading reviews about it.  It really was an interesting experience in a good way.    The menu is fantastic and also funny.  I went with a margarita which was done quite well and my wife went for a couple of the options off the menu.   We were pleased with our choices.  My wife also had to get the Hurricane Popcorn which she said was fantastic.  We would definitely comeback to try some of the other options on the menu.  The bartenders were fun as well and helpful with the menu and navigating everything."}
{"text":"Great selection of unique yet fantastic cocktails for any taste. Great service, tasty food. Very cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great vibe, love the ambience.  Large selection of drinks and a fun menu!  Love that it is housed in the space of the former prohibition headquarters. Excellent service."}
{"text":"This is my all time FAVORITE bar. I recently returned and tried more of the food. Which was quite tasty as well. My favorite items to order are the Hurricane popcorn and the Solaro cocktail. Two thumbs up! Love this place. Great classy atmosphere with an extensive cocktail list."}
{"text":"Trendy and chic. Long list of great drinks. Terrific small plates. Great staff. The place where all the beautiful people in Phoenix meet. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I'm having to give 3 stars because the hostesses are rude and should not be representing the business from a first impressions standpoint.  I do love their cocktails which is the only reason I keep coming back but man oh man can you please do something about your wait times?? Every time I go it's \"packed\" but not actually packed when you finally get in. Not to mention a two hour wait for 5 people?? But you don't take reservations.. Oh wait, you do take reservations because there are two empty tables but they are reserved for friends of an employee?? Grrrr. We finally got to sit at someone's table who we then find out had put their name in AFTER us, but was seated at an 6 table booth because they only had 4 people. So confused but the whole night was annoying to say the least. Work that system out because it sucks. And so do your hostesses. Except that one short girl, working outside, she was fine."}
{"text":"They will make you stand outside because they are full. They really aren't. The food and drinks are over priced and the atmosphere is very fake. The drinks and service are always decent. It's just not worth the wait and the money."}
{"text":"Great little spot.  Service is excellent.  Atmosphere is good, decent and diverse crowd.  Only complaint is their food menu is lackluster; to be kind.  So eat before you go."}
{"text":"Excellent cocktail and gastropub in downtown Phoenix that is open semi-late. This was my second time here, and I could not be more pleased. The Ramen burger was on point, and the service was great. Definitely a place to checkout when your in town, or a local."}
{"text":"Great drinks, great service, and yummy small plates. The place is hip. Try the Smashed Chips! Can't wait to return to try more drinks."}
{"text":"This bar/lounge was so well decorated. I liked the vibe... we went on a Saturday night and had to wait 45 mins to get in!   There's a menu.. with about 15 pages of drinks and liquors.. wow it was a little overwhelming reading through all of the different options.   The atmosphere is fun & the boards have funny sayings or quotes. I got the 5 chile margarita (i believe) it was so good!   Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Finally, the hubby and I stopped by on a Friday evening around 530p - we needed alcoholic drinks pronto as we had such a long workweek! Happy hour til 7p and there was no wait for a table: sweet!   I ordered the mojito, yum yum noodles with pork belly, the happy hour chicken, green chili mac with bacon and for dessert, the banoffee pot. Everything was fantastic! Every bite and every sip just made me forget the worries of the workweek and I fell in a relaxation bliss, finishing my cocktail before hubby finished his. That's a first...  It was all too great - the best way to start my weekend. The only issue was parking - they don't validate the parking structure at Cityscape, but I just went to CVS and got my parking ticket validated there."}
{"text":"Had our first date here. Wonderful place. Drinks are amazing. Food was tasteful as qell. Bartenders are very friendly and so much fun. Got married and revisited here. Just like the first time. Wonderful. The vibe is incredible."}
{"text":"I really like this place. Been here a few times and the atmosphere is always hip, the music is never too loud and the drinks are always strong!  Drinks: The Singapore Sling and the Hemingway are good if you like sweet drinks with just enough alcohol to make you feel warm and fuzzy. If you like your drinks strong enough to help you grow chest hair then the Old Fashion is the way to go!  Food: Ramen burger- nothing spectacular but worth a try.  Typhoon chicken- the sauce makes this tasty otherwise its just a chicken lettuce wrap Hurricane Popcorn- I love popcorn so this was a hit! Definitely worth a try. Has a spicy kick to it. Smashed Chips- My favorite! I think it has Sriracha on it or something similar."}
{"text":"Definitely the best bar I have been to thus far! Their menu has so many great options that it leaves you wanting to try every single drink there is. I chose to sit at the bar and I am so glad I did because you can see how much quality they put into their drinks. I was reading their story and it stated that they make all their juices for the drinks and you can really see that at the bar! Anytime I am in the downtown area and want a great drink I know where to go where I will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I fell in love tonight!! This bar or \"cocktail lounge\" as they call it is amazing!   The menu is extensive so be prepared to take your time picking out which cocktail you want to try first. The staff is very nice and not pushy at all, they will give you plenty of time to decide and they are also happy to help. I managed to try three different cocktails this visit. Before I get to that, I want to mention a little more about the staff...Super friendly, no attitude and very good service. The staff seem to work together as several different people checked on my table to see if I needed anything.   I started off with the Oriental Squeeze, then moved on to the Kaffir Lime and finished with the Wibble. I can honestly say that not one of these drinks is better than another. They are all AMAZING! The three cocktails I had all have citrus ingredients in common, something I tend lean towards. Please be patient, these cocktails are all handcrafted and made to perfection...This will of course take a little longer, but it's well worth the wait!   They serve food late which is always a good thing. Nice menu with a limited but still really great late night menu. I had the grilled cheese bites for an appetizer and the green chili mac (macaroni and cheese) as my entree. Oh so good!  One of the top mac and cheeses in the valley!   I saw a few desserts come out to other tables, they look pretty epic! I'll try to save room next time!  Check this place out! It's in a great old building and is very well done. Very comfortable!  I also want to mention how clean the restrooms are!   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Probably the best Manhattan I've had.  Great atmosphere, great selection of cocktails both classic and infused. Tim was excellent with his service.   Most definitely returning on my next business trip out here in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This is probably the 5th or 6th time my wife have been in. Sorry, but the attitude of the bartenders has really gone downhill since opening. Its a slow mid-week, plenty of room at the bar. I tell the bartender I'm in the mood for something similar a whisky smash, without saying a word, he whips something up, puts it down in front of me and walks away. I finally get his attention to ask what he made, and guess what, its a whisky smash. Wow, thanks, way to go out of your way and be creative, or at least pull something from the menu. There are plenty of great bartenders in the neighborhood that make just as fine a cocktail, but without the attitude, in fact, many of them have friendly, outgoing attitudes. Seems the folks at B&T have forgot they are in the \"service\" industry.  Too bad, because we really liked what they did to the place."}
{"text":"YOU MUST GO HERE. IMMEDIATELY. Only complaint is long waiting time- but that's because this place rocks. Try the popcorn. And be prepared to spend at least 10 minutes deciding on a cocktail- the menu is extensive."}
{"text":"I wasn't here to eat, I was here to drink and just walking in I could tell that the level of cocktail making was going to be super high. The cocktail menu is genius and a bit intimidating but the servers are very helpful and willing to help.   I did have a bite of my friend's ramen burger and it was delicious! So I'd recommend ordering that!"}
{"text":"Definitely a place to keep your eye on. Went there when they had only been open a few weeks, so obviously they are still working out the kinks.   As someone who understands mixology, this place excited me for sure. Their drink menu was a bit overwhelming, but definitely in a good way. Fun book to look through, and a lot of different things to try. I forgot the name but I had the drink with tequila and coconut foam and wow! I savored every sip!  Okay, now for the good and the bad. I'll start with the good. Quality of EVERYTHING was good. Decor, ingredients, vibe. For food we got the meat and cheese board and I'm a charcuterie girl and was impressed.   The only thing I was disappointed in was the service. I cut them slack because I know they just opened but it was still kind of shocking how many errors had happened. We had to ask for every item we ordered TWICE. But get this, the servers all had tablets that they put all orders into. So, instead of just simply putting our requests into her tablet she said yes, walked away, then forgot. Almost every single time. We walked into there ready to order a lot off the menu, but it was a lot of work to get her attention and time so we left with more money in our pockets than we expected.   But, other than that, I loved it and have been recommending the place to many."}
{"text":"Would definitely recommend! Great food, drinks and service!  It was my first time here and we sat at the bar. The bartenders were super friendly and very helpful when it came to choosing a cocktail since they have so many!   Would definitely recommend the LIT Up (long island)"}
{"text":"For those already familiar with this place, it is no surprise how good it is! I can understand why this place gets very crowded very quickly but worth the wait. Peg and I went early and absolutely loved the place. Nara was our server and she was really great.  Her recommendations were spot on. Chef Tam is so nice and very information about his dishes. I tried the dumpling burger (suggested by a number of chefs and the owner himself) and Peggy got the Yum Yum noodles with pork belly.  Both were shut-the-front-door delicious. The Grilled cheese bites came with wonderfully flavorful  cotija and sopa de tomate and the salad was finished with finely grated fresh parmesan cheese. Wonderful starters.  I really want to try his version of wings...   We got there about 5ish on a Saturday and walked in...at 6 there was a small but manageable wait. This is a definite comeback!!"}
{"text":"My sister and I went here because it's so close to where we stayed (Marriott Residence Inn); the menu is huge and fun to read. Lots of custom libations. The ambience is dark and jovial, the employees were nice enough, I did like that I could pay immediately, as the servers carry little tablets/iPads to take orders and payments. The drinks, unfortunately were a bit sour and not terribly enjoyable, which was underwhelming considering how much they seem to emphasize the beverage menu. I had a coconut type drink that had tequila (I believe), anyhow- maybe it was an off night, maybe the bartender accidentally added a bad ingredient; maybe they just need to tweak the recipe."}
{"text":"I don't even live in Phoenix and this is quite possibly my favorite cocktail bar ever. Was there on vacation and ended going back to this bar three times. Service was outstanding and always has great recommendations. The food was just amazing, definitely recommend the nachos. But our favorite part was obviously the drinks. There were so many to choose from I wish we lived there so we could go back and try more. We ended leaving with some fun souvenirs and hope to be back soon!"}
{"text":"This place is really really neat. I came after the symphony and was overwhelmed w the choices ahead of me (the best kind of problem to have in my opinion). I ended up sitting at the bar and not even ordering off the menu after multiple attempts of perusing it.   First drink was a passionfruit caipirinha. Can't say this was a good choice on my part. Just coming back from Brasil I've gotten accustomed to a certain freshness and strength in my caipirinha, but was disappointed by the passionfruit syrup used. Still - I blame myself for ordering this.   Second drink was a...gin sour? I told the bartender I liked gin, egg white, and nothing sickeningly sweet and this hit the spot perfectly!   Next time I will not be randomly fulfilling my craving and consult the knowledgeable bartenders first!"}
{"text":"The hype on this place is real people!! Came here before one of the baseball games and was not dissappointed!  Apparently there is always a wait but by some miracle we walked right in and got a table for 4!  I recommend sitting at the bar if you can - we had a table and all agreed the bar area would have been ideal.   The drink menu is intense and a bit overwhelming just because they have 30000 different delicious cocktails!  We asked our server and with 4 different girls all liking different things she nailed the recommendations for each of us.  I had the blackberry mojito - be careful goes down like water (delicious alcoholic water).   FOOD!  1. Chish and Fips - basic but delicious for a good ol' fish and chips dish  2. Dragon Burger - this is packed with flavor and is just delicious  3. Ramen Burger- this is so weird yet delicious! the crunch from the ramen bun and juicy burger go like peanut butter and jelly.  I dipped it in the sauce that came with the dragon burger and went from a 10 to an 11!  I feel like I used the word delicious a lot ...  Little bonus - server checks you right out at your table on her little tablet - quick and painless.  Easy for tab splitting."}
{"text":"The service unfortunately was not so great when we came here for a late lunch. The ambience is awesome and the location makes it a perfect place to pop in for drinks prior to an event downtown. Drinks are really good and we enjoyed the ramen burger. We'd definitely come back but do not have high hopes for the service as we've always felt like we're sitting and waiting waiting when at a normal table. I'd recommend grabbing a spot at the bar."}
{"text":"I cried twice today.  Once at the Heard Museum exhibits and secondly at Twisted eating korean beef cheek. #drinkbetter"}
{"text":"Obsessed with this bar. Has a total speakeasy feel, cool vibe, super fun bar and a menu that will keep you wanting more! They make cocktails FUN and are true mixologists here. I read over a handful of drinks I wanted to try. The food looked good too! We got brisket tacos! This place is a great date spot and I'll definitely be back. We inhaled the tacos before I could nab a pic but again, great fun vibe here for food and libations"}
{"text":"Upon walking in your greeted by cheery staff and a swanky cocktail bar of a time past.   I love the diamond tuft seating and overall vibe of this spot.   The drinks I have tried thus far are The born Tequila, Sucker Punch, The Singapore Sling, and the Coconut and the Lime, which are all devine!!!  My favorite is the Born Tequila.  It's sweet and Spicy"}
{"text":"I came for the cocktails and left for the same reason.   The cocktail menu is vast and fun, but is ultimately platitudes of the typical. I tried the 'Corpse Reviver No. Blue', which was alright. I wasn't expecting to describe a drink as \"alright\" in a self proclaimed cocktail parlor.   Off menu Ramos Gin Fizz was decent, but certainly wasn't shaken for 15 minutes, (how it is properly made), although I understand that's an absurdly long time to shake a drink. But, they didn't even try to fool us. It was served in about 5 minutes, and the foamy meringue head from the egg white was milk-shake bubbly, not the dense velvet micro-foam as it so notably should be.   The food was fairly good. I liked the Ramen \"MoMo\" Burger, and of the small plates the Angry Panda lettuce cups were casually tasty, although they were definitely missing something.   The decor and mystique is alluring at first impression, but throughout the course of the 45 minutes I spent there, I began to feel like the whole thing was entirely fabricated, contrived, and inauthentic.  Phoenix is hosting the SuperBowl this Sunday; I think B&T is a great place for SuperBowl fans to muse over feeling like their in the 1930's as they order their daiquiri's, banalities, and other sweet nothings.  Pro Tip: If you do find yourself in a similar predicament, walk across the street to the Blue Hound Kitchen & Cocktails and prepare to be exuberantly satisfied, as I sense their cocktails are best served in stark contrast to those of Bitter & Twisted's."}
{"text":"From the bar design to the epic cocktail menu, not a single detail was missed. B+T absolutely has one of the best bar teams in the world, they cruise thru high volume service with finesse and mind blowing speed. Their perfect gin martini is one of my favorite things, get it with onions and a twist. Ross and his team  from the front door to the back of the house will make your afternoon delight, dinner show or final final unforgettable. My only beef is that I got yelled at for throwing MY delicious popcorn at Micah Olson....i mean, who doesn't throw popcorn at him!?"}
{"text":"I have only been here for drinks on a weekend night, the atmosphere was busy and the night life was definitely present.On the crowded side for my liking, and I felt as though the wait was a bit much. Possibly may try during the week and during non-peak times."}
{"text":"Plan to come early to read the menu because the first time, there are just so many drinks to choose from. I didn't like most of what I ordered (five drinks), but the ingredients are quality and there's so much variety that I'll have to try again.  The noshing food was delicious...popcorn and tots and peppers and noodles with my drinks, yes please."}
{"text":"I came here with a few friends for my best friend's 21st birthday and I've been wanting to go back. The atmosphere was really fun- I liked the dark/cozy lighting and looking at the menu is like flipping through an art book. There were so many options that it felt  nearly impossible to choose. The drinks were strong, too. Even after only one, I was feeling pretty damn good.   It is a little pricey, but I think with a place like this the idea is that you get what you pay for, and you're paying for more than just the drink. You're paying for the whole experience of having so many options, enjoying the atmosphere, and getting good service. It's a cool place.  I really want to try the ramen burger! I'll definitely be back for that."}
{"text":"The selection is overwhelming but they make up for that in the drinks. Best drink I have had so far \"the orchard\" highly recommend."}
{"text":"Excellent cocktails and best grilled cheese bites ever! Staff super friendly and attentive, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"So today was my second time at Bitter and Twisted.  The first being an early soft opening and the second being their grand opening.  On the soft opening I went to I had a wait.  A considerable wait.  That's ok.  I understand that a restaurant uses soft openings to refine their systems and work out the kinks.  I know that my drinks will be discounted, my food will be comped, and the reason for this is that the restaurant or bar is using me as guinea pig.  These are the trade offs that come with soft openings.  They are not to get you in the door and try their stuff for free or discounted rates.  They are to refine their service.  With this said I expect good service and quality product on opening night when you have had multiple soft openings.  Luckily Bitter and Twisted delivered on their opening night.    Every drink I've had here has been strong, delicious, inventive, and delicious.  Also the drinks have been delicious and inventive and delicious and strong.  I've yet to try something there that isn't one of the tastiest drinks I've had in Phoenix.  It makes me a bit sad to see a few negative reviews dampen the beauty and creativity that has gone into this bar.  I hope the rest can see past a few people who don't understand what a soft opening is and see what the rest of phoenix already gets.  Bitter and Twisted is a next step in Downtown Phoenix as well as Arizona."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The best way to secure a table is the app called \"no wait\". Otherwise get there early. I really enjoy the whole concept and the massive drink menu. This place is favorite bar ever. Deffinatley a special occasion place. I highly recommend the bathtub drink. It is strong and good for 4 people."}
{"text":"A Bar for people who like good cocktails.  This is a place for trying new things, and finding excitement in the layering of different flavors of a cocktail.  Their cocktail book is cute and handy, but you'll have just as much fun just talking with the bartender to figure out what you want.  great ambience and a great place to hang out downtown."}
{"text":"My husband and I were married at the downtown courthouse last week and went for a drink at Bitter & Twisted for drinks afterward. Amazing staff and terrific cocktails. We had such a great experience. The bartenders and staff made us feel so special on our special day."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere!! The bartenders where super nice and knowledgeable about the menu. The cocktail menu was larger then the food menu with so many awesome choices. My first drink was some sort of wine concoction for $12 which was really good then I moved to basic and just got the cheapest red wine they offered white was $10!  For my food choice I got the meat and cheese board $16!!!! It was amazing and they were kind enough to bring me veggies to dip into the 3 sauces instead of the bread.  Overall Cool place, a little pricey for me but everything was made well and delicious and lots of options also everyone was very friendly which goes a long way with me!"}
{"text":"I came here for my boss' farewell happy hour. At first, I was a little hesitant because my coworker looked up the place and was not impressed by the pictures. I was also a little wary when I arrived, because the doors and windows were all covered, which meant you couldn't see into the building. But man am I glad I went in and that this was the place my boss chose.  First, the drinks. I ordered a pineapple mojito, which was strong and oh so limey and minty and delicious. And beautiful. All around, an amazing drink. Unfortunately, about 5 minutes in to the drink, I was gesticulating wildly as I do, and knocked it all over myself. This transitions us to my second point.  The service. They were just kind and cool people. They provided great recommendations for what to drink, they brought me a mojito on the house (despite it being my idiocy and not their fault that it spilled everywhere), and were attentive without being overbearing. We had some friends who we didn't know were coming, and when the table next to us graciously moved down one so that our friends could join (THANK YOU!), the servers moved all the drinks and food that our friends ordered over to ease the transition, which brings us to...  The food. For a place that calls itself a cocktail parlour, I did not think that the food would be as phenomenal as it was. Great concepts, good-sized portions, phenomenal flavors. This is probably the only cocktail parlour that I can say that I would 100% come here, even if I couldn't drink a drop. But I can, and I did, and it was great.  Definitely coming back again."}
{"text":"The cocktails are AMAZING. You can tell each ingredient is carefully selected to create the most incredible, unexpected, unique flavor. Haven't met a drink I didn't like! Plus, great ambiance and close to everything downtown."}
{"text":"If you love cocktails and you love downtown Phoenix, hustle over to Bitter & Twisted. It's in the old Luhrs Building (or Luhrs Tower...I can't keep them straight), which was built in the 1920s, making it one of the oldest standing buildings in town. As in, it's already kinda cool. The décor inside is dark, in a sexy loft kinda way, with high industrial-ish ceilings.  The drink menu is adorable and very intriguing. It's about 15 pages long, with the drinks all grouped by 'type' (martinis on one, shots on one....don't remember the other categories!). But the best part is on the back they have mapped out all the drinks on one of those 'concept' maps. It goes from traditional to experimental and from easy drinking to straight to the point....or something like that. I prefer to choose by the map - go for the most experimental first! So far every drink has been really good, including waitress recommendations (they know their stuff), bartender's choice, and even the 'shot in the dark' (bartender's choice shot). It is expensive, but a cool place to start the night. I've been in 3 times and never had a problem with a wait (even got a table for a group of 8), but then again, I'm an old loser, so I showed up pretty early, around 7 or 8. Overall, I think downtown Phx is the best place to take visitors and Bitter & Twisted is the best cocktail bar downtown."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here this past Wednesday after the d-backs game. I had always wanted to go here but we live kind of far so since we were in the area it was the perfect time to try it out! I love love the vibe of this place, they do id you before entering but that's perfect because then no kids! :) our bartender Zach was phenomenal he was very helpful and patience in our attempt to choose a cocktail out of their extensive book of choices. The drinks were amazing and so fun! I'm hoping to go back for my birthday! :) kudos b&t keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Bitter & Twisted is one of the best bars in downtown Phoenix! Worth the wait. Amazing cocktail bar!! Ambience is great! My favorite drink whiskey berry jubilee it's delicious"}
{"text":"Was expecting a high end craft-cocktail experience, but everything I tried was just OK... so I couldn't help but feel a sense of disappointment. I will say this though - their menu is brilliant; whoever authored that has real talent.   Avoid the pork belly - flavor of the sauce was meh."}
{"text":"decent for Phoenix. the high ceilings, old industrial space, and exposed structures make it feel like more like Portland or Seattle. the sometimes indifferent attitude of the bartenders make it feel much more like the former than the latter. the food and cocktails are quite good, and they've been able to lure me back more than once because of these. the cocktail menu is a bit tacky. really, who hands out laminated cocktail menus these days? oh wait, the Cheesecake factory does. overall, though, this is a pretty legit place for downtown PHX. oh, and PS, check out the creepy dolls way above the bar.... i think they're made of hair and gum..."}
{"text":"We came on a Saturday night around 8pm. There was a 20-25 minute wait for a party of two. The wait wasn't too bad and it added to the whole mystery/storybook feel because you couldn't quite see inside.   Once you are seated, you are transported into the world that Bitter & Twisted has created. Their menu is really an alcoholic storybook. There are many ways to determine which drink is for you. You can read the menu and the ingredients, you can use their \"map\", or ask the bartender. Speaking of asking the bartender, they have my utmost respect for remembering all these drinks!   I got the Lovefruit Medley then shared the L.I.T. Up with my bf. The Lovefruit was delicious and fruity. It feel in the \"play it safe\" section of the map. The LIT Up on the other hand veered much closer to the dangerous side. Watching the bartender make the LIT Up was cool too with the whole carbonation thing.   I didn't get a chance to try their food but they had a very interesting menu! All in all, it was a great experience!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite date spots I'm downtown phoenix. Cocktails are all made out of fresh ingredients and the bartenders definitely know what they are doing!"}
{"text":"We used the no wait app and it told us to be there at 10:05pm. We showed up at 9:55 and checked in. The guy with the iPad told us we would get a text as soon as it was ready. We proceeded to wait another 35 minutes. Several times other parties were walking up and getting in. The guy kept saying Metallica and Neil diamond are in town. As if that even mattered. Don't advertise to use the no wait app and then say \"it's not our fault\". You subscribe to that service to use. Worst customer service. We asked to speak to someone else other than him and he wouldn't let us. A girl came out of the bar and said it was empty on the inside. We've been here before and the prices aren't even worth the drinks. Don't waste your time. We had two people celebrating birthdays in our group and we were willing to spend money."}
{"text":"Well, I was apprehensive at first because of all the slanderous articles I read.. But I decided to say, \"Fuck the disinformation, I'm putting this place to my own test.\" .. And I can happily say that I am glad I made that choice!   So to frame my encounter: I went there for happy hour.  The ambiance was nice, the hostess was friendly and the bar staff was extremely helpful! For virgins- the posse and I just wanted to experience all that B&T had to offer! We ordered the cocktail special, to see what they mixers had to offer.. And they hit it spot on.. The Kentucky Mule had the kick and the taste we were looking for!!   Topped off the pallet with some Seoul chicken, and the Smashed Chips.. Awesome.  TL;DR: We will be coming back.   Keep it up B&T- we don't want to see you burn out!"}
{"text":"Love that downtown Phoenix has this amazing place!!  We will be sure to bring all our out of town guests to this gem. I think this place will be around for many years and has helped to change and shape downtown. The atmosphere was hip, service good, food unique and tasty, and drinks in a league of there own. Keep pumping out the awesomeness!"}
{"text":"Overall service was awesome.   From the time we walked in to the time we left, all the servers were attentive. We had one main waitress, however, 3 additional servers came to us to top our waters off or simply asked how the food was.   Food was amazing as well as the drinks. I love the whole idea of picking a beverage depending on how you would want to feel after finishing the drink: Get to the Point, Refresh, Divergent, and Play it Safe. The drinks served was spot on.   I will definitely come back a third, fourth, fifth time!"}
{"text":"I mean it's cool and all, but do people really like these places that think they're hipper than they are? The giant menu is impressive and the staff are very friendly (if you can get service) but man those drinks are pricy and pretty weak. If you want to get buzzed, you'll have to pay through the nose. You're paying for that fancy, Manhattan-y, vibe. Not for me."}
{"text":"totally random but someone is giving free hugs tonight ( just one though, so don't ask for more :))"}
{"text":"Drinks galore!! Masters in mixology--caters to your every craving. Food is top notch - does not disappoint! Mac n cheese, Tingling chicken and pot roast tacos are awesome."}
{"text":"Wow, what an incredible experience. Top notch service from the doorman, to the hostess, to the server, and the manager. All were so helpful and genuinely cared about my party's over all experience. The drinks were beyond beautiful, and tasted like an explosion of flavors in my mouth. I highly recommend anything containing passionfruit! This is a hidden gem in Phoenix, and they truly take pride in the exceptional service they offer. Blown away, and will be recommending to anyone and everyone visiting downtown."}
{"text":"Such a nice atmosphere for happy hour, with An endless amount of choices for drinks. I will be frequenting this place more often!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place.  The drinks were creative and interesting.  I had the old fashioned drink and it was great! The bartenders were sociable and knowledgeable about other places to go.  It was a short walk from our hotel and we loved to go after dinner.  I recommend it especially for those visiting the city like me."}
{"text":"I love this place! I would give it one star so I can be on the Yelper of the week board...But it's my favorite cocktail place in my beloved Phoenix. Thanks bitter and twisted for making downtown cool again!!"}
{"text":"A great place for a cocktail with the spouse. Severs were outstanding and you could see how the bartenders were putting passion in their craft, and not just \"mixing drinks\" the menu is awesome as well."}
{"text":"There are soooo many great things to say about this place and writing a review almost seems like idle chatter.  Regardless I feel compelled that everyone should discover this space whether your passing through Phoenix or live on the outskirts of the Phoenix metropolis.   Are you in the mood for the traditional, perhaps looking to explore some nuance cocktails a friend had in lands far-a-way, maybe just breaking the mold of the usual then walk on in and be greeted with welcoming and on-point service.  The bartenders are exceptionally trained and versed to provide you with whatever cocktail you could dream of or heard in passing.  The service from the bar to the lounge/restaurant area will appeal to all walks of life whether you're talking shop or breaking down about your deep emotional ties to whatever.  The service, food and drink will always feed the need for the mood you're in.  It's become a staple go-to for many of the locals in the industry along with convention goers because of the space, decor and well thought thought food and drink menu.  The spirit selection will impress the connoisseur on a nightly venture to find something less spoken about while the basic cocktail guzzler may be less impressed thus creating an atmosphere that facilitates actual conversation not facilitated by alcohol leading to meaningless dribble.  I love this place for a reason and it's because it's pickled my heart in the best of the best of what the spirits world has to offer!"}
{"text":"I just really hope I make the \"yelper of the week\" marquee    \"Bathtub cocktail was too big and boozy\"  Here from Tucson.  Really love the employees. You can tell they take a lot of pride in their restaurant."}
{"text":"Been here time and time again since it's opened. I'm here if not a few times a month, at least once a week for HH. Love the atmosphere & the bartenders. Everyone is soooo nice and helpful. This Cocktail Parlour will NEVER fail you. My all time favorite bar/lounge to go not only in Downtown Phoenix, but Arizona!"}
{"text":"Best meal I had in Phoenix. Hands down.   Such a low-key restaurant and bar. You go into this building and past the red curtains. It's a huge place and they hand you a menu that looks like a video game manual. I love that they map out all the different types of cocktails for you. You choose based on how strong and how eclectic you want your drinks.  Cocktails I had: - Strawberry \"sundae\": zubrowka bison grass vodka with cream, strawberries, chocolate, vanilla and banana liqueurs -- LOVED this!!!!! - Tiramisu -- dessert in cocktail form? YES PLEASE   Food:  - Typhoon chicken: fried chicken and 8 spice salt, bread crumbs, chilies, scallion, garlic and watermelon kimchi lettuce cups. Highly recommended. - Ramen \"Momo\" Burger: the bun was replaced by crispy ramen, and meat cooked to your liking."}
{"text":"I wish I would have had a chance to give this bar a better review. Unfortunately, from the moment we walked in all we got was the disappointment. Look, I get it- on nights when there are concerts, or it's been a long day it's hard to alway deliver the best customer service- and yet you should never discriminate on people with handicaps. Our waitress Veereana was incredibly rude and provided horrible service to the table. After watching me walk in, and because of my limp I have from recovering from surgery and friendly laughs and banter amongst the table she said she refused to serve me because of my appearance. After calmly attempting to explain what my situation was she lied and said that several other people had verified that I was unservable. After asking to communicate with the Manager Dan - who was obviously now put in a position to validate his server. He made claims and refused to name the people who accused me of showing any signs of not being servable for any valid reasons outside of my handicap. Again, I know people are just trying to do their job and  I know this review will be brushed off or continued to be defended. However, it was the first time I have experienced people being real jerks just because of an injury."}
{"text":"One of the girls I work with told me the drinks here at Bitter and Twisted are the best drinks she has ever had. That is quite a promise so I figured I might as well check it out and see if it lives up the hype! Well I have to say she is absolutely right. The drinks here are art. They have state of the art equipment for making drinks fizzy and all (I'm not sure of the exact terminology I'm no expert haha) and just all around mixing them perfectly. The happy hour menu is very reasonably priced and the drinks are strong! I love the blackberry mojitos and also the \"thrifty cocktail\" which is a mixed berry lemonade. And they make their own crystallized sugar which goes along the rim and is just delicious! The last time we went we also had the smashed chips which are potatoes with zesty sauce and avocado and they are awesome. Not necessarily chips- slices of crispy potato which is even better. The vibe here is trendy and upscale but still relaxed. I love the oversized booths and the curtains. It would be a great place to go with friends or for date night, which I have yet to do but will! My friend is so right- best drinks I've ever had (so far!) and the staff is all so nice and friendly too. A must do in downtown Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I am in love with Bitter & Twisted. From the name of the place (so clever!) to the atmosphere to the delicious food and most importantly, the fantastic drinks! My husband and I visited during a weeknight and arrived right as they opened around 4pm. We sat at the bar and had great service. The bartender was friendly and knowledgeable, which was great.     I ordered two different drinks - a pina colada and another fruity drink. Both were delicious. My husband ordered two different drinks, which I can't recall the names of. He really enjoyed those as well. We also ordered the Pork Belly Buns. These were delicious! The pork belly was tender and crispy and super flavorful. After we polished those off, we ordered the Smashed Chips. These were phenomenal! Thick cut potato chips with spice horseradish sauce and avocado heaven. I would order these again in a heartbeat. I really wanted to try one of their boozy cupcakes, but they didn't have them that day.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Outstanding Old Fashion, but the reason I came was to try the Typhoon Chicken.  Well worth the trip, it tasted great and right amount of spice and kick.  If it wasn't a Wednesday night I could have seen myself staying there longer and drinking more to cool the spices in my mouth."}
{"text":"Classy and fun spot for a date night, ladies night, or happy hour with the co-workers! The service is very good even when they get super busy. We tend to go for happy hour otherwise it can be quite pricey.   The drink menu is like a book. Pages and pages of boozy decadence. It is so hard to choose! I usually go for a happy hour Collins. You can mix and match flavors and it is fun to try a new one each time.   But let me get to the popcorn... Ohemgee! I'm obsessed. It is ridiculous and addictive. That is all I'm going to say about that.  Other food is tasty as well. I'm a fan of the mac and cheese and my hubby likes the fried chicken.   On their board of specials they have a yelper of the week. Always amusing when it is a bitchy yelper!"}
{"text":"With the use of Yelp and some friends recommendations stopped at this place.  They seated our large party quickly and service was great.  The Manhattan's are soooo smooth here.  If you go please do yourself a favor and get a Ramen burger.  Absolutely amazing dish and all of the flavor was beyond what I had expected."}
{"text":"I like this place. It's subdued and upscale, a nice departure from crowded loud bars. Extensive cocktail list, knowledgeable staff, and great Asian inspired menu. It's not for everyone--the prices can be high and the reservations policies are probably too much for your average meathead from the outskirts to fathom. They also feature a \"Yelper of the Week\" section on their display board that is hilarious. I'd like to be their Yelper of the Week but I'm giving five stars and not saying something ironic or completely oblivious. Oh well maybe they'll piss me off someday and I'll get Yelper of the week. It would be an honor."}
{"text":"We only came for the dessert and... WOW! The \"Campfire\" Marshmallows was great. The graham cracker was delicious. The texture was like a biscuit or shortbread."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with good food.  I had the ramen burger which was rich but excellent.  There were almost too many cocktails to choose from but all that I had were good.  It has a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Love this place. A cocktail extravaganza! Make time for a wait, especially b4 a show. Always worth it though."}
{"text":"Came here one evening with friends. Saw a bald headed bouncer outside, black tight t shirt, and a line. Oh god... it's one of thooooooose.     But no! It's not! At all! The bouncer was extremely polite and took down a cell number to call us when our table is ready. This place actually WANTS to give you good service! They could pack the bar and have a standing room only, but they don't. This is a true cocktail experience.   Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Off the hook. Thank you Dan, Summer, Jenna and the rest of the team for a fun and delicious evening. The palates of this crew are amazing. They hooked up a cocktail journey that was spot on. Will be back here every time in Phoenix. Excellent job.  What a team!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot for a cocktail. It was really busy, so we had a 20 min wait, but it was worth it. We tried a bunch of cocktails, and loved them all!"}
{"text":"Go for the cocktails, but stay for the food. I'd stop then a couple times to grab a cocktail before or after a show downtown, but never tried the food. What a mistake! The chef (I forget his name, Bob maybe) is from Hong Kong and is no joke. He does a unique take on a lot of comfort food favorites."}
{"text":"My party was a very complicated mess with the number of people who showed up on a Saturday night and even with all of the mess the hostess and manager made it work for me. I appreciate their patience and the service was stellar.  The cheese and bread board was amazing and the drink menu is lengthy so if you can't find anything that you like then that's on you! I will be going again but just with a smaller party."}
{"text":"We decided to try out Bitter & Twisted with a group of friends ! This place was packed on a nice Saturday night! We were seated on the side of the bar at the couch area. Our server was very attentive and our drinks came out quickly. I ordered the porn star martini, which was fabulous! We started off with a couple of small bites - highly recommend the chips and the tacos. I had the burger for dinner and WOW. Really excellent flavor. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Outstanding! Gave Bartender Jason Magers complete control and he did not disappoint. Told him one thing, \"I like rye whisky\"! (Sit at the bar.)"}
{"text":"Bitter & Twisted aims to impress in a cool, unpretentious way. They're a slightly upscale and spacious bar tucked away on the side of a historic building. The interior is warm: exposed brick, classic decor. They have a large bar at the front of the house and booths and tables on the other side.  The drink list (actually a pamphlet) was the most extensive I've seen. They put a lot of thought into their drinks, and all reflected the effort. My first drink was a tequila cocktail with citrus, topped with a delicious coconut foam and lime zest. My second was a perfectly balanced blackberry bramble. Both had healthy pours, so that coupled with the quality left me with no issues on the prices.  Their food menu matched the creative spirits. I really enjoyed the pork belly. The Typhoon Chicken was lacking some seasoning, but wasn't too bad. Our experience culminated with their s'mores dessert: roasted, possibly house made(?) marshmallows attached to edible Graham sticks served with a semi-sweet chocolate dipping sauce. If only I could have stayed for 5 more drinks and 2 more desserts."}
{"text":"Very cool place with great vibes and ambiance! I'm an east-coaster and love the New York-like social scene and feel I get from this place. Cocktails are on point and they have quite an eclectic choice in food options. If you're up for something sweet and wanna have some fun, try the deconstructed smores. Yummers!"}
{"text":"Awesome place for drinks! Great atmosphere.  Our bartender Jason was great, we really enjoyed watching make the drinks.  Such a fun place, we need more places like this in downtown Phoenix!"}
{"text":"My wife and I frequented Bitter & Twisted quite often when it first opened. Due to self-inflicted dietary restrictions it had been a good 9 months to a year since our last visit. Upon returning last week I was instantly reminded of why I fell in love with this beautifully designed cocktail parlor when first it opened in Downtown Phoenix. We went celebrating my wife's birthday and ordered some old favorites (hers: the \"had tequila\" mine: \"whiskeyberry\") and a round of the house shots. To our amazement the bartender still recognized us even though it had been so long. Top notch service and top shelf drinks, what more can you ask for from an establishment. Good food? Yeah they've got that too! We are going to make it a point to not go so long in between visits from now on!"}
{"text":"This is an old school bar with old school drinks. Unfortunately they do  not have old school prices, however.  The drink menu is exhaustive and can be overwhelming, but the staff is more than helpful. The drinks are handcrafted and do take awhile, understandably. This is *not* the place to go if you want to order a rum and coke.  You come here to order old school handcrafted cocktails.  In addition, there is a menu as well and I ordered the Ramen burger out of curiousity with someone.  Since then, I've had it twice. It is unbelievable. I get the hype now.  it is divine.    They also offer cocktail cupcakes once a week as well. Homemade  cupcakes are made with booze. Sometimes in the cupcake, but often in the icing.  If you want one, get there quick because they sell out.    The atmosphere is classy and serene.  I do hope they've rid the 'reservation sytem'. Not having a reservation and not being allowed in even when there are tons of empty tables?  Not cool."}
{"text":"Needs a 3.5 stars.  Cons - Zero signage on the door, walked right past it. Print out a simple sign and post it above the frosted glass, simple.  Until you get a real one.   The burger was good, a solid B, but towards the end of me eating it I removed the bottom bun and could really start to get the lemongrass notes in the dish, which was why I ordered.  Could have used some more Jalapeño flavor as well.  Pros - The Elote Locos (corn chips and corn salsa) was a nice surprise.  The cocktail was good as well, I got the Lemongrass one. There was a theme this evening. Nice space overall. Clean.  Nice to haves- TV's, a couple of draft beers.  Would go back to try again."}
{"text":"I had THE BEST drink ever here. I forgot what it was called but it was phenomenal. I was overwhelmed by the menu but the bartender asked a couple of questions and voila, came up with a perfect drink for me. Definitely my favorite bar in Phoenix hands down!"}
{"text":"My partner and I read various reviews of Bitter and Twisted before we decided to visit. It seemed that most people online felt the service there was lacking. Our experience was quite the opposite. Our time at Bitter and Twisted was stellar. Our drinks were delicious. The owner stopped by and was very friendly and grateful for our drop-in. The bartenders (there were three working) were all very friendly and accommodating. We stopped by Bitter and Twisted on a late Saturday afternoon. This was during Comicon weekend and also a D-Backs game. Upon entering the establishment, there were only about 6 other guests in the whole place. When we left around two hours later, the place was over 3/4 full. I'm glad we went when we did!  The building and decor are beautiful. The employees are hard to recognize as there is not really a uniform. It seems that they all wear dark colors (?). The drink menu is expansive. It appeals mostly to a foodie or gourmet type. The food menu is a little too foo-foo for myself and my partner. That says a lot as she is a french-trained chef and myself, I am a school administrator who, in a past life, worked in hospitality for over 10 years. We love food and drinks! We love to learn about them too. However, the food menu was a little too complex for us personally. The owners could have made their food menu a little more pub-grup accessible. Beet & egg? What is that?! If the staff had time to discuss items with us, we probably would have been adventurous enough to give something a chance. However, the bartenders just don't have time to give a descriptive sell to items on the menu. And we weren't into looking up definitions of food items on Google during our visit. :)   All in all, we were impressed by Bitter and Twisted. The staff was knowledgable, the location was great.  Remember, all drinks are certainly hand made. Our drinks took about 7 minutes to make and deliver to us and we were sitting at the bar. Allow that kind of time before you decide to ding the service. The employees and owners of this place obviously have a passion for gourmet cocktails. They have an \"ice program\" after all. And no energy drinks in the place. This is not your average watering hole. Nice job, Bitter and Twisted. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great cocktails! Ross is a fantastic bar tender! This is a must try! I was excited upon our arrival. It's like a cocktail parlor out of a movie. The drinks are more expensive than usual but the quality and taste is far superior to other."}
{"text":"Jason the bartender was amazing! His drinks were delicious and he was attentive in his service; we never had to flag him down, he always asked us before our drinks were done if we needed another. Will absolutely come back! Def recommend the sidecar"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Cocktails are well balanced and customer service is 100% on point. Love the look from the outside and even better on the inside. Ask ANY bartender for a drink on the menu or off and its perfect. Im committed to any place that provides great, honest, genuine customer service and this place my friends is it!   If you want details well here is my mild take on Bitter and Twisted!!!  Food: love the hurricane popcorn - Im from Hawaii and having arare and furakake with my popcorn is normal but seeing it on a bar menu .... winner!!!! Grilled cheese bites - love, love, love this served with tomato soup/sauce (they call it some other fancy word) and the bread is soooooo good - served up on Phoenix's own noble bread. Which is another reason why I love this place! They keep it local ....any place that supports locally already has my attention! Uuggghhh and the Noble bread with pâté - perfect late night snack (just saying).   Cocktails!!!! This one is hard for me because Im that girl that will trust the bartender to make anything for me (especially here)!!!! They know exactly what I like to drink. A few of my faves on the menu would be Bear Witness - comes in a honey bear jar.  Thats probably a first timers favorite just because why not have a cute cocktail in a honey container shaped like a bear!  My all time personal fave would be an old fashioned with Rum Diplomatico (thanks Tim ;)) I've never had a drink I didn't like.  You will just have to go and try it yourself."}
{"text":"Ok first off the Ramen burger is hands down amazing! if your a Ramen noodle fan and lived off it like i did in College then you need to try the burger.. Medium rare or well is clutch!"}
{"text":"Honestly, the fact that they have a \"Yelper of the Week\" is pretty fantastic. I can only aspire to one day be that cool. But, truthfully this was a great place to kick back and relax. All the employees I encountered were wonderfully helpful, and I probably would have ordered the bathtub drink but I feel like I would have been judged for drinking it by myself. The cocktails I had were great, as was the Hurricane Popcorn. An awesome spot!"}
{"text":"The cocktails are amazing and so are the short ribs! Great vibe and the \"Lime in the Coconut\" is a slice of heaven in a martini glass. We had to wait to be seated but it was worth the wait. We need more places like this downtown Phoenix. Oh and love all the art work on the walls."}
{"text":"Went early on their opening night in an attempt to beat the crowd.  It worked but the service was still slow.  The atmosphere is stellar and the drink menu is extensive and had an interesting layout (potentially difficult to read and understand if you're a newb to high end cocktails.  I hesitantly ordered the Old Fashion; it's easy to mess this drink up, but was thoroughly pleased with the outcome!  I'd definitely return."}
{"text":"Great Ramen Burger, green chili mac and cheese with great cocktails the only let down was the cupcake dessert"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite bar in Phoenix! They have 49 cocktails and an impressive menu of both originals and classics. Delicious food, too. The Solero was my favorite drink (so many still to try!), and for food I loved the ribs and also the bread with homemade braised-carrot butter. They offer reservations (even for small parties), which I definitely recommend for Friday/Saturday nights. It's a beautifully designed space inside the Luhrs Building (1924). Thank you for opening up this wonderful spot in Phoenix!!"}
{"text":"Great place for a casual night out to grab drinks. Great cocktails that are moderately priced."}
{"text":"Gotta love a place that calls out their yelpers! Also I completely disagree with the statement I saw on the wall! Not over priced, amazing staff & I look like a sweaty pile of trash & they serve me! Good craft cocktails take time people! #ilovethisbar"}
{"text":"The first question.    On what day solid God allow the creation of Bitter and Twisted?  The next question.  Couldn't he have rested on that day too?"}
{"text":"Great place that open in Phoenix with swanky decor and a catalog of drinks (alcohol free for those DD or health conscious individuals :-0.   The place is a bit dark inside so for some, it's a good thing, and for others...well, you get it. I thought the drinks were poured strong which I like, especially if you are going to get your money's worth.  There is a limit capacity but the doorman out front will take down your name and the number of people in your party and text you when the table is ready which was great. We crossed the street to another bar for a refreshment then our table was ready within 20 mins or so.  Creative, fun and lively."}
{"text":"Came here to enjoy some scotch and cigars.  Our wives were at the Pink concert and my friend B and I were loving life drinking and smoking.    Our service was awesome. They have a great menu and small outside seating area that would accommodate us to enjoy the perfect Phoenix weather, smoke our cigars and people watch.    I highly recommend.  Our server started us out with their well scotch which was called Pigs Nose.  Then we moved onto the Monkey Shoulder.  Awesome ice balls as big as a baseball(almost).  They charge $2 for an ice ball, but well worth it.  We then went on to a great single malt.  All in all, it was a great experience.    Cheers Vic"}
{"text":"Bitter & Twisted reminds of places back in the northeast and is probably the best bar I've come across in Phoenix.    The crowd is good looking!  The drink list is fairly expansive...and the bartenders are phenomenal!  They work hard and execute their drinks to perfection.  The food is quite tasty too.  I sampled a few appetizers from the somewhat ecclectic menu and I was not disappointed.  The restaurant is styled nicely and has a super modern sleek hipster vibe!  And they LOVE Yelpers!!!  Definitely check out this place!  Even if you aren't downtown, its worth the drive."}
{"text":"Can I give this place more than 5 stars!!!? Everything about this place is chic and innovative. There menu is a BOOK of handcrafted cocktail recipes, and it seems like there are limitless options.  I've celebrated bachelorette parties, birthdays and chill nights here. They make their own ice and filter their own water and have things like cucumber \"air\" bubbles and gin fizz. Yes they are that awesome. They also don't use any \"regular\" or \"well\" alcohol and all of their options are considered premium. So if you like Jack Daniels and/or Ciroc, this place is not for you. The last time we went I ordered a BATHTUB drink that serves up to 4. Insanely cool. Service has always been good anytime we go and the servers actually take your order via iPad which cuts out any mistakes that could be made by walking away to place your order. This place is perfect for an easy-going time in downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"How cool was that ! Brian the bartender could be the sole reason to visit this place! Knows his drinks and the food they serve. Vibrant lively personality engages with the crowd as needed and provides great suggestions! The ambience is hip , food and cocktails to die for ... We were visiting PHX for work and picked this place to celebrate a colleague's birthday. Everyone enjoyed the meal and the place. Smashed chips, pork belly , fish & chips and brisket tacos were our food choices which were all delectable   in their own way. Tried 4 different cocktails and every one of them was so elegantly crafted that it simply blew your mind !!!  A must visit if you are in Phoenix."}
{"text":"We are in town visiting a good friend ?that suggested this place.  On the way here, I checked ?the reputation of this joint via fellow Yelpies. Looks like they are known for their drinks. Okie doke, I am downnnnnnn.  We got the old fashioned, passion fruit mojito, and whiskey jub?i?lee. All ?of them ?were pretty, ?flavorful, and strong. We got our money's worth - Yeahhhhhhh.  In addition? to the drinks?, we order?ed? the ramen burger, dumpling burger, and typhoon chicken. The typhoon chicken is like a chicken wrap and the burgers were ?like ?any burger with? their unique twist on it. The ramen burger was tha thang 2 years ago, and I guess it's still going rather strong. I didn't get a chance to try any and there was plenty in LA. So why not here? And boy was it yummy. The meat/patty was the star of the burger - juicy, moist, and flavorful. I ordered medium rare; the buns were replaced fried ramen. It was very well balanced in texture and flavor. I would order this again! The hubster ordered the chicken typhoon. The texture was crispy and well balanced too.  ?The two dishes that I personally tried were balanced in season, flavor and texture; and it made the dish very enjoyable.  Great mix of drinks, starch?y? food, and the staff was ?also ?attentive. We had 3 diff staff (our waitress, the owner I believe another lady) check? in on? our progress.  ?Overall, it was great food, great ambiance, and great service. We hit a good spot tonight."}
{"text":"Whenever I get the free time to go out, I go here. Their menu consists of amazing drinks that are made so skillfully by wonderful bartenders (shout out to Brian who convinced me that any drink made properly can be delicious), as well as a variety of food options.  And while you would think that a place that is known mainly for their drinks would have mediocre food -- you're wrong. I almost always get the Hurricane Popcorn and the Dumpling Burger. Both have such great flavors that keep you coming back for more. The Ramen Burger and Yum Yum Noodles are also delicious.   You just can't go wrong here. Whether it's The Orchard cocktail with fresh pressed apple cider, or a classic Old Fashioned, everything you consume here is amazing. I always bring friends and family here when I can and they fall in love just as quickly.  Pro Tip: try and sit at the bar if you can. The bartenders are so nice and watching them make drinks into art is extremely entertaining. You come to understand why the drinks are $10+."}
{"text":"Landed late and after checking into the hotel a couple blocks away, we decide to explore a bit and see if we could grab a drink and a bite to eat somewhere close by. Though I was tired from the flight, im glad I did. This place was awesome. I wish we had a place like this back home. The people were soo nice! Starting from John,  the doorman that greeted us to our server Barbara.  She was attentive, friendly and knowledgeable about the huge menu. The drinks were excellent. Ordered the Seoul fried chicken. Its fried chicken bites,  kim chi, watermelon and cheese gravy. Sounds bizarre right? But I was feeling a little Anthony Bourdainish and decided, why not? Im on vacay! It was delish!  Overall, cool bar, without being pretentious.  Oh, and they seat you at tables with other people. U2 was in town and we were lucky enough to be seated with some really cool people from the crew."}
{"text":"While I wish I could write a scathing review and hopefully become featured on the infamous Yelp review board, I cannot bring myself to do so! It'd be dishonest and selfish ;)  I've been to B&T about a dozen times, perhaps more, and each experience has been pretty solid. We often get excited to bring others here, especially if they're visiting from out of town. It's one of the cooler, more unique spaces in downtown Phoenix, and I've never been to another place exactly like it anywhere else. They are also amazing at making cocktails, of course!  While I generally don't like cocktails, since they have such an extensive bar and list, along with many specialty drinks, I do love to try new drinks out. As I've stated elsewhere, I usually go for beer or non-alcoholic beverages. However, the experience is what it's all about here! You shouldn't go here to get wasted -- the drinks are sometimes on the pricier side of things, but you're paying for quality, craftsmanship, experience, and environment. Indeed, I think this is one of the few places we could call the bartenders true \"mixologists\" ;P  I can't honestly think of a specific drink I've had that is especially notable, but the drink that comes in an emptied out coke can is pretty great and interesting. I think it's like a long island. I just order the \"coke can drink,\" to be honest. :) They do great takes on classics, such as manhattans or old fashioneds, and they also have notable special drinks. The big bath tub drink is good, I hear, but I mostly enjoy seeing other tables/groups ordering it and marveling at how ridiculous it is.  By the way, their menus are cool! I've now seen 3 or 4 different menu themes. I miss the retro space-themed menu (and corresponding drinks/drink group themes). I also really miss the retro video game theme and the corresponding TVs/retro game consoles they had at the tables. However, the new storybook theme and children's books to entertain visitors at the tables are just as cool. I love how the menu is a true publication, with unique artwork and high quality printing. It's no surprise that people attempt to steal them all the time! (No wonder they have to put a warning on the back!)   I've never had negative experiences here that involve the staff or bar itself. Unfortunately, other patrons can be a bit on the obnoxious side. They visit this space thinking it's something else entirely. This is not a place for chuggskis and shotguns, bro. THIS IS A CLASSY PLACE! ;) haha. Usually, they bring in quite a diverse crowd, and most people seem to be friendly and calm.  Also, that bathroom hallway -- weird things happen back there. Drunk people and a slightly confusing restroom layout do not mix well. I've had some fascinating run-ins back there ;) We also had a guy a few visits ago who stopped by our table on his way out to attempt to swipe one of our menus to take home with him. Why?! The staff was all over it, though, and reprimanded him appropriately. Drunk dude was quite drunk (and embarrassed after that. ;)  Oh, the building itself is also gorgeous. The entire building used to be a newspaper printing facility, I believe. The B&T space features these massive pillars, and the huge bar space is just gorgeous. The finishing touches are also unique and wonderful. We love the furniture and artwork featured throughout. Such a fun place to visit! :)  OH, by the way -- it's not necessarily known for its food, but the food they do offer is pretty decent. The popcorn is also highly recommended. I usually hate popcorn, but it's pretty delicious here!"}
{"text":"This place never fails to disappoint! Came in last night with some friends and we were all very pleased with our food and drink decisions. As usual, the popcorn was amazing! I ordered the Luhrs salad and grilled cheese bites. WOW! The salad was extremely refreshing and the grilled cheese bites were out of this world. My friends ordered the Yum Yum noodles, Angry Panda and Chish and Fips. Everybody loved their food. As for the drinks, we ordered the Strawberry Mojito, Strawberry Collins, Old Fashioned and a few others I can't remember. Come and check it out!"}
{"text":"I had heard great things about this place so I was excited to try it. The bar looks awesome and the selection of spirits was huge. Our bartender was very unfriendly and looked miserable to be there which was disappointing as we had never been and were looking for suggestions. We ordered some cocktails from the happy hour menu and some off of it, all of them were very good. We ordered the hurricane popcorn which was very good, the green chili mac which was also very good, and the angry panda which I was warned had anchovies but they were very hard and the texture took away from the meal. If I could order the angry panda without them I would say the dish is flavorful and fresh. Our waitress in the restaurant had a great personality and was very helpful and attentive. I will likely come back to give them another shot but was overall a bit disappointed."}
{"text":"Soooooo snobby. People go downtown to get away from scottsdale. Friday night 4.5 foot bouncer gave us a hard time trying to get into an 1/2 empty bar. Dude definitely had a hard time in high school. Get over yourselves guys... Your not that cool!   Was In the area Friday night and went back and had the same experience! That was the last time. I am done with that place I will tell everyone never to go."}
{"text":"Food was great, service mediocre and cocktails uninspired. Sorry, I really wanted to love this place, as I love cocktail bars, but their food out shown their cocktails. Our server was far from pleasant and forgot about us after more tables showed up.   Hats off to their culinary though as food was excellent!"}
{"text":"Excellent place for cocktails. Service is great and beverages are awesome. My wife had the lime & the coconut (two to three) and she loved the drink. I'm having a nice rum on the rocks. Oaky, not too sweet. Great! Tim the bartender is great. Best bar downtown."}
{"text":"this place can be a wee bit intimidating because the menu is quite large and has foreign words on it.  but the drinks are really well crafted and the staff is very nice.  I felt like it was worth every dollar.  This place also is more accommodating than I was expecting, so we didn't have to wait long.  overall, great spot.  Will be adding to the rotation."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best bar I've ever been to. My husband and I celebrated our anniversary with a cocktail dinner and literally every drink that came out was better than the last. Amazing food, too. In his charming Scottish accent, Ross Simon explained what was in each drink. The first thing he asked us was if there was anything we didn't like, and I said gin, so he made us gin cocktails that he promised we would love--and sure enough, we did. We really enjoyed the relaxed, unpretentious atmosphere. Cool building, too!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  Better drinks.  Chill yet sophisticated.  This is a place you will want to go back to again and again."}
{"text":"Never a disappointment! Happy hour from 3-6 cannot be beat and if Dan the GM is on-site he will make sure you love your drink and offer suggestions based on your flavor preference. The hurricane popcorn is great as a nibble between cocktails. The other appetizers are spot on as well! The vibe is hip yet not overbearing, a favorite anytime we are downtown!   Prices are reasonable, during happy hour select cocktails are $6 and their storybook menu of everything else is usually $12... unless you want to share a perfectly concocted punch for up to 5 people for $50.   Did I mention they make most all their ingredients in house, including the ice? Yes, ice. It's custom made to not make your drink cloudy, diluted and just average.   Take the light rail it runs right past the place and enjoy what cocktails are meant to be; exquisite, accessible and damn delicious!"}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've had, maybe ever?? I had the pork belly bao and a couple of drinks and nothing was disappointing l. The bao was soft and fluffy, the pork belly was incredibly tender with that perfect but of crisp on the edge. Also the tiramisu was somehow even nicer to drink than it was to look at which was a very high bar."}
{"text":"Because of B&T, we discovered the joy of cocktails.  We are still as nerdy as ever, but now we come here and map out our drinks, whereas before we used to stay home and map out dungeons in D&D.   It'll cost a few gold coins, and there's no Elven Ale served in this tavern, but coming here is definitely an adventure.  They have a few gluten free items on the menu.  I like the meat and cheese platter, though it's not completely GF.  The staff is friendly, patient and helpful.  The drink menu....it goes on and on...  My favorite is the Mon Cherie, a dazzling mix of chocolate and cherry that manages to be sophisticated and haunting.  The Godfrey is a favorite.  Speaking of haunted, my husband used to work in the building and informs me that the building is reported to have a ghost, though sadly not in the restaurant area itself.  The place has a wonderful old-timely atmosphere, so rare in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This place has an excellent atmosphere if you are wanting to have a conversation and actually hear the person across from you! But they have plenty of drink combinations to choose from. My personal favorite is the lime and the coconut. I usually go here on the weekends and they occasionally have live music that is a great addition to the experience."}
{"text":"This place rocks! Loved the atmosphere, loved the bartender and the drinks were on point. This place needs a television show!"}
{"text":"Holy smokes! From the decor to the drink menu -- this place is so unique! Got there around 6pm and it was already packed but no line outside. We ordered the charcuterie board ($16.50) to share: artisanal cheese, cured meats, bread, olives, and different types of spreads. It's a good sharing size for 4 people. I really wanted to dry their other items like the Seoul fried chicken and pork belly buns but we were waiting for 7:30 dinner reservations at a restaurant down the street so I just opted for a drink. Their drink menu is literally an adult version of a Disney book. They make a great play on words for the drink names. The pages are beautifully designed and each section has a different theme. #drinkmenugoals. Our waitress was super nice and kindly offered to split the chat for each of us. Love it when the restaurant has and offers that option!  Oh and peep their menu on the wall where they call out Yelpers ;). Nice touch."}
{"text":"Love this place! Try the Solero if you like passion fruit. This is the fourth time I've been to B&T and I've loved it every time! It's a good idea to try to get a reservation if you have a large party.   So glad to have this place in downtown Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Check my pictures for details on the food and drink as it came out. I described what I thought of each dish we ordered.   Was ok but nothing spectacular. Expected a lot more. Food was decent but nothing original. Same with the drinks.   Service was absolutely outstanding though. Would try it again just for that. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it to any friends visiting from out of town"}
{"text":"The first time I came here they had the red carpet and velvet ropes pulled out for me and it was very private/discreet just how I like it, but when my friends and I got there they must not have recognized me as a famous celebrity. (Remember that time I was asked to be an extra on Entourage, but am so cool and popular I turned them down?) They took one look at us and turned us away.  Maybe because I showered and dressed nicely they didn't recognize me.  The bouncer/security guy or whatever you want to call him did get my number and said he would text me later.  I wasn't sure I wanted to give it to him since you know I'm taken. He reassured me it was only to let us know when a table was available, but can you really trust bouncer/security/whatever the h** he is?    The whole thing was very strange to me and a little pretentious.  I get they are trying to be different with the whole \"let's not get it crowded in here because I want to look cool instead of making more money,\" but really is all that BS necessary.  If you are going to put on this big show you better be f'ing cool. While I think this bar/cocktail parlour whatever you want to call it is pretty decent it is far from f'ing cool.  I never have gotten turned away at a bar in LA even when there were mixologists (better known as bartenders).    Anyways, 30 minutes or so later they did text us but we were busy then and were debating on even going back. (Apparently they do let you make reservations.  I am more of a drop in kind of person though).  The next couple times I came here it was during happy hour.  HH is daily 4-7pm.  The happy hour was not busy.  There was no one outside and we easily got a table and/or seat at the bar. (btw-if you are like me you will totally miss the door the first time.  They have no signage on it. I tried a couple doors before actually finding the right one.  Don't worry you won't be the only one or oh wait am I the only one? I'm just not cool enough for this trendy stuff). The crowd is interesting.  You are going to find everyone from elderly, 20 somethings, fancy dresses, cut-off shorts, frat boys, business men etc.  I did not see many hipsters though.  While I haven't tried their signature Ramen Burger from all of the food I had I would skip the food altogether and just have drinks.  The best part of the Fried Chicken with watermelon kimchi was the kimchi.  I think maybe they should just give me a big ole side of watermelon kimchi without the chicken.  The meat and cheese plate was weak and expensive.  Only 2 kinds of cheese, no nuts and no olives (my favorite).  You can get a way better meat and cheese plate at Postinos for $1 less.  The smashed chips were probably my favorite and honestly they were only okay nothing special.  I would like to try the popcorn because I've heard it is good.  Popcorn and a cocktail sounds nice right about now too.  The drinks I have had here have been great and they aren't weak.  I do think the happy hour drink prices are an amazing deal. You can get a good cocktail for $6. I also like the whole concept of telling them what kind of drinks you like and they just make something for you. A lot of bars in LA do this and I think it is a fun way to learn and try different things. I am an avid reader, but the drink menu is a little intimidating to me.  It is a book that I need to take home and study in case their is an exam later."}
{"text":"Our last stop of the evening on our Parents Night Out adventure and I'm still not exactly sure what I drank, all I know is it was served in a teacup and had an orchid. BAM!  $33 for 2 drinks sounds like 5 Trips to chick fil a in my opinion but hey, it was a night out to remember! The door guy just needs a little attitude adjustment, it's not a nightclub in South beach. Everything after walking inside was smooth sailing!"}
{"text":"You must try B&T!!!  Reading the reviews about the long drink menus whetted my appetite and raised my hopes. For those who don't know, B&T has a long list of interesting cocktails and some have put the place down for it.   If the menu scares you ... ASK FOR ADVICE! The service staff know all about the drinks and if you give them a sense for what you like, they can point you in the right direction. My thought is that most bars have the same alcohol, but lack the skills to put it to good use! Cheers to B&T for sharing their skills with us and helping us experience new drinks.   So, I'm a snob with the old fashioned. They make a great oldie. Then, when I asked for something new, but similar, the waitress recommended the sazerac. It was amazing. Since my introduction to sazerac at B&T, I've been hooked and have ordered it elsewhere. Unfortunately, making the drink is an art few have mastered like B&T.   Enough to about the drinks? Probably.   Food? Oh yea, they are amazing creators of culinary delights. Not joking here. If you want jalapeño poppers and stale popcorn, don't come here. B&T takes a thoughtful approach to their food menu. I have had most of their happy hour menu and all items are worth writing about. Go with friends so you can try a lot of things.   I guess I should mention the atmosphere. It's fantastic, cool, fun, interactive, etc. The location fits the offering. If you are going alone, sit at a communal table in the bar and meet some interesting people. I did once and had a blast.    The only negative would be price. But then again, you get what you pay for, don't you?"}
{"text":"We went there for the goat time last night.good and drinks were excellent. Fun unique choices for food and drink.  Only downside was how long it took server girl to find items on the order I pad."}
{"text":"I stopped in with a friend tonight and boy am I glad. The signage is a little obscure and the entrance is inconspicuous, but don't let that keep you from stopping in. It's fantastic. The decor is great. It feels like a swanky big city bar, but not as pretentious. And there aren't many places in Phoenix where you can get a true culinary cocktail experience like this. I asked Jason, our bartender, for a recommendation, thinking \"what's good on the menu?\" He proceeded to ask what I liked in a cocktail and after getting a feel for what I wanted, he built me a custom-made off-menu cocktail that was crazy delicious. This place is one of the best additions to downtown phoenix I've seen yet. I plan on being a regular."}
{"text":"we were turned away because they were filled to capacity. yet a peek thru the window there were empty tables. no line to get in. must be too cool for cash. four of us moved on."}
{"text":"I wish I could give it 0 stars. I can't get over how rude the bouncer was. First of all, it was my friend's bachelorette party. Is it just me or when it's someone's bachelorette u say yes to letting them in anywhere. We were a group of beautiful l, late 20 year old  women, dressed top notch, in elegant and chic attire. We were sweet and looking for a great time to celebrate such a milestone event. I'm appalled that any bar would reject a bachelorette. There was absolutely no need for that. I will never return to this place as I prefer to spend my money at establishments who hire people with souls!! Get rid of your wannabe rent- a -cops/ Napoleon syndrome bouncers."}
{"text":"I like it but I also don't love cocktails. So overall I was out of my element. But a cool place for sure.  I'll be back"}
{"text":"What a disappointment, waste of time and $$. It doesn't matter how good the food or drinks are when the service is horrible. The waitress seemed miserable and was short tempered. Our experience was just the same. I literally chugged my drink just so I could leave. Better yet, she asked if we wanted change, which would have been a 50% tip. Maybe I missed something. Advice: Customers- Find another place...there are many great establishments right around the corner; Waitress-Find a new job. Life's too short."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend usually love this place. Last night it was my friends 23rd birthday! Me, my boyfriend and 3 of our friends were anticipating going out last night. We had just finished at Hanny's downtown and walked over to bitter and twisted. We each had a couple drinks at dinner. We were excited to take our out of town friend from Seattle there for the whole experience. When we walked in around 11pm, there was not a host or any staff at the front for a few minutes. When she arrived at the host stand she apologized for us having to wait there. We responded \"no big deal :)\" she talked to us for a couple of minutes and we were eager to go in. My friend (who's birthday it was) attempts to hand her ID to the staff member. She didn't take it or look at it. She then started talking to us about how fun our night was. She was talking for a while but ultimately decided we were not going to be served. For what reason, I'm not sure. We were all very confused. My boyfriend loved the 'hurricane popcorn' and 'Korean nachos' so he didn't eat much durning our time at Hannay's looking forward for the small plates and apps here. He asked the host if we were just able to go in to eat. At this point she was very condescending and rude. She was not letting us in for whatever reason. I am very disappointed, confused, and honestly irritated. Two stars for this experience."}
{"text":"I could be a Whale in this Blind Tiger.  Oh yeah.  Give me some more of that stiff Giggle Water (Old Fashioned, please).  Game.On.  We moved in across the street and had heard about this place through word-of-mouth and thought we'd give it a try.  We have lived all over the country and been to some really cool bars and even SpeakEasy types that didn't really pack the gear to serve in the beloved Corps.  (You won't get that unless you've seen Full Metal Jacket or are a Marine).  Bitter and Twisted made me feel like a Big Cheese.   My girlfriend bought me this fedora hat years ago and it still has the tag on it. It's black with a feather.  I've always wanted to save it for something but after a couple hours in Bitter and Twisted all I wanted to do was put it on and smoke a fat cigar.  This place was certifiably awesome.  Bartenders were great.  It'd be hard for me now to go to any of these chain places that make \"craft cocktails\" after going here.  I tell you their brains must soak in a lot of knowledge to be able to pour it out in these drinks.  They literally are made to a perfection.  I ordered an Old Fashioned, my favorite drink but seemingly elusive at most places, and they did it right.  The only thing that would've been cooler while sipping this beauty would've been drinking it in the back of an old Mercury Eight with with a fat cigar and a Roaring Twenties hottie, although I was with my GF so that counts.   We will definitely be regulars here.  I'd much rather go here and pay for a solid drink than chance it at some of these other places that make drinks according to which way the wind is blowing and gamble at the speed of who can do their count slower.    This place is the Big Cheese of the Phoenix bars."}
{"text":"Love this place. Love Tim. If you have half a brain, you love this place. AMAZING DRINKS. AMAZING FOOD. AMAZING STAFF. What more must I say? If you haven't been, go. Why are you still reading this?? You should be driving there now."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  The food, ambience, and drinks are awesome.  We went for happy hour.  It really gave us an opportunity to try a lot of different things.  The noodles were yummy, the drinks have fresh ingredients so they are extra special and still strong."}
{"text":"WOW!  Food great,  drinks are awesome.  Green chili mac and pretzel burger.  Portioned perfectly for the richness."}
{"text":"Bitter & Twisted is an awesome place to have drinks and food. The drink menu is a little overwhelming, but the bartenders and waitresses are awesome at recommending drinks. The service is fast and efficient. I recommend everyone to go there if they are looking for a place that is low key."}
{"text":"excellent experience - top notch service. sexy, dimly lit atmosphere with an extensive cocktail list. I asked the bartender to just make whatever brugal-based drink he wanted, and what he came up with was subtle and perfect. I didn't try any food but from what I saw at adjacent tables, the snacks looked pretty delicious. great place for a date! and conveniently located right near the cityscape center and the light rail."}
{"text":"Located near CityScape in the renovated old Luhrs building sits Bitter and Twisted. The ambiance of the space is superb and the rules you have to abide by only improve it. No reservations, no standing at the bar and no whining. If you don't like the rules go somewhere else.  I have never had a problem finding a spot but I probably go at slower times. I've sat at the bar and flipped through the drink magazine, yes it is intimidating at first but once you get used to it you'll be taken on an adventure. I've tried alcohols and mixers I normally would have stayed away from. Thanks B&T. I must say the Lemongrass Tom Collins is one of the best damn drinks I have tried in ages.  The food is great too, try the loaded fries and the popcorn. You can thank me later."}
{"text":"updating my rating.  updated rating.  here is my rating update.  have i typed enough characters?"}
{"text":"Such fun...love the historic charm, trendy cocktails and energetic vibe...a must if you're looking for a true downtown Urban establishment! Gotta try the Vesper martini!"}
{"text":"This is a great new bar a couple of blocks west of the US Airways Center. When my boyfriend and I visited the bar, the owner actually crafted our cocktails for us. He explained how they make all of their juices in house and have a special ice machine that creates different types of ice for the variety of cocktails they offer. I was incredibly impressed with how much effort they put into the atmosphere and drinks. They have a great drink menu and an incredible liquor selection. I ordered the Lemongrass Collins and it was PERFECT. Not too sweet, the perfect blend of citrus. It is the perfect summer cocktail. My boyfriend ordered a Manhattan (and I think he had Rye Whiskey) and he really enjoyed it. We will definitely be back the next time we are in downtown Phoenix. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here twice. First time was awesome, but today which is the second time was even better. We ordered some of there specialty drinks. After ordering a couple, we instantly wanted to try the rest of them on the menu. Our go to food is always the ramen burger and we got the Korean nachos this time as well. Great tasting food. We're going to try to taste all the drinks on their menu!"}
{"text":"Amazing cocktails! Not a good place to go to grab a beer or a quick drink but man, if you like cocktails and novel drinks this spot is a good time."}
{"text":"I like this place, I really do - and I love that it is located in downtown Phoenix. Even more to its credit, B&T is located in the beautifully renovated old Luhrs building, and the ambiance is awesome.  Having been a few times before, I recently read an unflattering review of B&T's reservation policy. I mentioned this to a friend, a fellow classic cocktail enthusiast, and he said, \"Let's check it out this week!\" And it was on. I called in advance and thoroughly grilled the polite guy who answered my call, but all I could gather was that reservations probably weren't needed and they'd be happy to see us in about an hour (this was a Thursday evening). This was reliable information - we were promptly seated in a booth when we arrived.  So, how about the drinks/food (listed by order of priority in my mind)? The lengthy drink menu \"book\" is a little bit much for me, but the owner, Ross, explained it when he came out to our table to check on us last night. True to his explanation, that menu style has pushed me to try several drink recipes that are outside my normal comfort zone (on multiple visits), and I'm glad I did.  Also unexpectedly at our table last night was the head chef from the kitchen (don't forget that this place is more than just cocktails). My wife asked the waitress about noodle dishes (not on the menu), so the chef came out to discuss what he could make from scratch to satisfy her request. We ended up sharing a delicious Thai-style curry dish as a result.  And lastly, this review would be incomplete without a mention of the other off-menu sampling we did last night. Ross, while geeking out over mixology experiences with my friend Keith, decided to let us sample a Czech herbed liquor called becherovka. It was pleasant. Also pleasant was the \"secret menu\" (for cocktail geeks only) that we received and from which we ordered. This is the menu I will try on my next visit."}
{"text":"Popped in after having a blast at a Yelp event in the area. We were seated immediately on a Thursday night with a party of 7 without a RSVP.  They have a huge drink menu with over 60 drinks and a modest food menu. The drink menu is beautifully illustrated back to front! I love coming here just to ogle at the storybook themed artwork on every page. I ordered a Ship Load of Rum and shared the nachos and pork belly steamed buns. They definitely don't skimp on the alcohol here. My drink was strong and not overly syrupy. A good balance of fruity and boozy! The nachos were super tasty, I love the way they fry their chips. The steam buns were by far my favorite. They come with extra sauce on the side as well as some cucumbers. The meat itself was seasoned well and the texture was melt in your mouth goood, I personally didn't need any extra sauce. The buns didn't disappoint either! Warm and tender, the perfect package for every bit of meaty heaven.  Service was prompt and friendly. They were always open to answer any questions we had about the menu. Also on it with the water refills and checking on us throughout our meal.  Overall my whole party had a great time here. We loved the food, service, and atmosphere! Will be back again."}
{"text":"Ya'll are VERY wrong with your reservation times. I signed up for one and ya'll said \"30\" minutes. I didn't get a call until 2 hours later!!! Only to be told I was 5 minutes late for MY RESERVATION!!!!! FIVE FUCKING MINUTES!!!!! What the FUCK does that mean?!?!?!?! You put me last in the waiting list AFTER waiting 2 hours... You're not that special. At. All."}
{"text":"I can't believe there are so many five-star reviews. My friend and I showed up a little after 4 PM on their grand opening. We each had a drink over a nearly two-hour period. Would we have loved more drinks? Sure, but alas it wasn't in the cards for us.  The service was incredibly slow and inattentive. I don't believe that \"it's opening day\" should be an excuse, especially for an establishment that has had as many soft launches and special events as Bitter & Twisted did. Your PR team helped you blow up in the press. Assume you're going to be busy and have the staff to support that.  As for our drinks, my friend couldn't order the Lime in the Coconut, because they were out of the coconut base. It's the opening night, and we showed up right when you opened. How are you out? Again, no excuses. Make sure your stuff is in stock on opening night.   I ordered the happy hour Tom Collins, and my friend ordered the Bramble. My drink came first and I was basically done with it by the time my friend got her drink. The server said that they had to \"make the blackberry syrup,\" but we watched the bartender make the drink super belatedly and he definitely just pulled the syrup off the shelf. Methinks the server forgot to put the order in.   Were the drinks worth the long wait? No. We watched the bartenders make our drinks, and the alcohol was certainly lacking. Furthermore, you have a 24-page cocktail menu, but you only put one drink on happy hour? Everyone loves happy hours, and a lot of times people won't splurge on drinks until they vet them on happy hour pricing. You have oodles of cocktails; give the masses an opportunity to try them.   Outside of the drinks, the food menu for happy hour seems legit. In fact, we were going to order food, but our server was more rare than rain this time of year. Also, we saw servers bringing dishes to other tables. The price didn't match the portions, so we decided against food.  At that point, we figured it'd take a century to get another drink, so we called it a night. Of course, cashing out also took a century.  The establishment is beautiful, and the cocktail menu is incredibly enticing. The food menu, while ridiculously highfalutin, is intriguing. For these reasons, I'll give them another whirl. If they want to thrive, though, they should take a page from Clever Koi and offer weekday specials, beef up their happy hour menu, and sincerely re-examine their service."}
{"text":"Had the most amazing burger there, a bit spicy, the bun was made out of ramen noodles. I know it sounds crazy, but it was amazing! I had a sucker punch cocktail. It was really tasty. We had a lot of fun and would definitely go again of ever in Phoenix."}
{"text":"To all the Yelpers, B&T just got a bad one ! It's rather ridiculous!!! It's about 8:30 pm...the hostesses stated that they can't accommodate party of 8, yet there is half empty inside & half empty outside in the patio. Also, there is something about violate \"fire-codes\" to stand by the bar. Seriously??? Well, we went to Lustre to chill by the pool-rooftop. Too bad B&T ! It's been a disappointing experience. There are other spots around here that do catering to customers without being snobby about! I have been here many times -- this one is just pathetic ! Hope your business model will redirect to a better approach."}
{"text":"Drinks here are amazing! Tried their Pina Colada, Solero and Lime and Coconut which were all very good. Very impressed with the staff, they were very welcoming our waitress was really professional. Will most definitely come back again."}
{"text":"This place is a must stop if you're in downtown Phoenix.  If you're looking for a great atmosphere with great drinks don't look any further.  Happy hour times are busy and don't expect to show up with a group of people and expect to sit at the bar.  They are very strict at having groups crowd the bar area.  Come with a friend or a date and you'll have room at the bar.  Otherwise get on the list and wait for a table like normal people do and be patient to be seated.  It's worth the wait.  The food is tasty and the staff is friendly.  You won't find another place like this in downtown.  They make a pretty good old fashioned along with many other drinks.  5 star place with 5 star service."}
{"text":"Been in the bar/restaurant game for a long,  this place is 1st class in cuisine, cocktails and service!   Def.  be back, see you guys again soon!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for Happy Hour yesterday. It's my second time here. Love the vibe!  Adore the menu! Had the drink of the day. It was wonderful. A rum/vanilla concoction. Also had the brisket nachos and the popcorn. Fabulous.  Our server was Michele. Delightful. Attentive.  If you haven't been.... you need to go."}
{"text":"What a delightful experience! Best cocktails in town, and buckle up the menu takes you on whimsical journey with badass art n descriptions of drinks to make your mouth water. Can't wait to go back, and  eventually have every drink on the menu! Definitely recommend sitting at the bar."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times, both when it is very busy and when it is a little slower. I will say I enjoy my experience here more when I sit at the bar. if you are going here expect your drinks to take a while. its not bad service. it is art ! they are not whipping together some applebees signature margarita they are making a fantastic artisan cocktail from scratch and they do this for every single drink . it takes time. and when I can sit at the bar and watch the process and how much goes into it I enjoy the experience even more. that being said, especially when its busy this is a place that if your coming plan on having spare time to spend this is not the place to go for a quick drink while in a rush,   maybe the best part of the experience is the knowledge of the craft from the bartenders, this is one place i dont mind going in and telling the bartender what flavor profiles I like and letting them get creative! as a fellow bartender I can appreciate this alot .   only negative is price, as far as some cocktails being in the 15 dollar range without having liquors in them that really deserve that price ."}
{"text":"Every single time I go I LOVE. The cocktail menu is comparable to the Cheesecake Factory Menu (lol) but the staff and bartenders are so helpful so you won't be overwhelmed. The food is full of flavor, don't even get me started on their signature savory popcorn. Great place for a date or a group, call ahead and let them know your coming"}
{"text":"I love this place! It is so cozy, yet chic. The cocktail menu goes on forever, which is great if you are up for trying something different. I love that all of the servers seem to know the menu and have tried many items on the menu. The servers are friendly and are great at making suggestions. I wish there were a few drinks that were closer to the 9-10 dollar range and more food items on the menu, but I have to say that Mac and cheese is amazing!! I didn't love the tacos, but everything else I have tried has been really good. I hope to try the ramen burger soon. I think it's worth driving downtown to check out!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great. Friendly staff. The crowd is generally hipster and nice dressed professionals. The drinks are delicious and very fun to pick out. Music is very trendy and what you would expect at a younger crowd place."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite place to get a drink in Phoenix! The menu is incredibly unique and fun to look through and drink through. Wouldn't recommend the food, drinks really are the specialty. This place does a good job giving you the \"speakeasy\" feel."}
{"text":"I've been here on several occasions and their cocktails never disappoint. My friends and I wanted to stop by for drinks on a Saturday night, of course that's one of their busier nights but fortunately for us we could add our name to the waitlist via Yelp or call and add our name with the receptionist. I did the latter since our group was larger than 7 people. The receptionist was helpful, took my name and number and gave me an estimated time. I received a text message alert letting me know when my table was ready and they held it for me for 15 minutes (allowing us to get to the establishment while we were in another business nearby). I was seated promptly, and the waitress was attentive and helpful. Their drink menu can be overwhelming for newcomers but their wait staff is always great in helping you pick out the perfect drink for your taste buds. A must stop when you're in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"This place is like no other in town. It is geared much more towards the event of cocktailing with a small group or your honey.   Do you ever have the experience when you are sitting at the bar and some a-hole keeps bumping into you fro behind, or reaching over you to get a drink, well not at this bar. It is a no standing bar, you have to have a chair for your booty, no standing anywhere. It is a strange thing to comprehend, as no other place is like that, but I totally agree and love it! The booths are high backed and very cozy. The windows are frosted so you aren't distracted by the outside, just in the moment you are in right there. No TVs to distract you and no \"crap\" on the walls.  I have two complaints, the sign outside - at night you cannot see it! I needs more light on it, my husband pointed it out three times before I figured out where the hell it was. Second, the bartenders are so focused on making the drink perfect that it takes nearly 10 min to get the darn thing, I truly appreciate attention to detail and an artfully crafted drink, but lets make it a little snappier.   Check them out, you will love it!!! We hope to have some food next time, ramen burger? what?!"}
{"text":"Amazing change of pace bar. Cool low key swagger. Had to wait but totally worth it! The drink menu is unbelievable and the wait staff is incredibly patient and helpful. They won't lead you astray. Great place for a large party or first date. I'd come back in a heart beat.  Try whatever the wait staff suggests, they know what they are doing. ."}
{"text":"Great Cocktails, Great Food and Great Service! Jason was awesome! Mac and Cheese and Grilled Cheese was Bomb!!"}
{"text":"Favorite cocktail bar by far.  the decor, music and endless drink selection make this one of the best places in Phoenix. I have also sampled almost all the food items...the Ramen burger and the fried chicken with watermelon kimchi are divine. Can't go wrong with any of the drinks although they make some of the best negroni's and old fashions.  tip: sit at the bar for fastest service."}
{"text":"This was a fun place to go for a quick bite before a show.  Limited food menu but what we got was delicious.  Drink menu was huge and a little overwhelming but it was fun to read through it. We had wonderful service and the atmosphere was worth it."}
{"text":"Extremely enjoyable. Music was varied and of a decent volume. Food and drink came out in a decent time and was of excellent quality. I will come back for sure."}
{"text":"Was a little challenged by the menu, but WOW was the food good. Off the charts good.  The Old fashioned made with Eagle rare Rye whiskey was easily one of, or should I say two of the best I have ever had. And our server Barbara was radically great."}
{"text":"Awesome cocktails with a whimsical cocktail menu or more like book along with cocktails to match the theme. Beautiful bar and dining booths. Loved it."}
{"text":"The drinks here are really great and I love their smashed chips. Too bad their service is awful. We tried to go there twice tonight and both times, the \"little wait\" of 45 minutes extended well beyond and we were not able to go at all. This would be understandable if I hadn't witnessed first hand that they don't even fill the place before they act like it's full. This is probably because their subpar servers are too busy having drinks with their friends to wait on their tables, another thing I have witnessed first hand. I wish I could patronage this place more, but they are unconcerned with this. More worried about the appearance of exclusiveness and terrible service."}
{"text":"Great place! From the moment we walked in, the General Manager, Dan, made us feel incredibly welcome and at home. Lauren, our waitress, was very knowledgeable and helped us dissect the extensive drink menu. She helped us each order the perfect drink for our individual tastes. Great experience! Thank you!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of cocktails and I thought Bitter & Twisted was one of the better places in the Phoenix area. I went on a Saturday night and it wasn't very crowded, so I was able to sit at the bar and speak to the bartender as he made my drinks. It was nice because he was able to go in to detail about some of the things he was doing.   I knew I made a good choice about going here because Kevin Binkley walked in and sat a few seats away from me. I pretty much just over heard what he ordered and got the same thing. When one of the best chefs in the state is deciding on food for himself, I'll pretty much always go with what he's getting.   Whenever I go downtown for an event, I always want to start the night with a drink from here. Definitely my favorite spot downtown to get a cocktail. I recommend going for happy hour, they have some good food specials."}
{"text":"Amazing spot for libations and delicious cuisine.   Friendly and knowledgeable staff that is very customer service oriented.   A must stop while in Downtown Phoenix and well worth the drive for the experience."}
{"text":"Loved this place! For one the bartenders were amazing. Sometimes you sit at the bar and the bartender's have zero personality and are a bit snooty. Loved the bartenders at this place and love the way we were treated. Loved the pork belly buns and also a noodle dish we got for happy hour. Had a great time looking through their massive book of cocktails. I was in cocktail heaven! Everything I had was great... Even the happy hour margarita. Love the ambience, food and the drinks here. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"If it's cocktails you seek this is your place.....  oh and they have some great food as well!  Get the popcorn....!  Stop in with one or two others and try a couple different cocktails- dry, classic, spicy sweet.  Pair up with some of their street food and discuss the experience.  Cheers"}
{"text":"Wanted to check this place out for awhile because I saw that they had the ramen burger.. the ramen burger itself was just okay.. the ramen noodles they made to use as buns was to crispy and not really what I expected.. I thought it would have more flavor to them but the meat itself was good.. the pork belly buns was pretty good I would defin get those if we come back.. and they have a variety of drinks to choose from.. the fruit medley was pretty good"}
{"text":"Still one of my favorite bars in Downtown Phoenix! Ross serves up great drinks and their food menu is definitely exciting and is best described as a fusion of Asian flavors with an innovative touch.  I came here with a couple of gals for a GNO (girls night out) and started with yummy cocktails and some small plates to share. I decided to go with something a little different instead of my go-to Whiskey or Rum and went with a Gin-based cocktail, the Singapore Sling. For food we shared the Smash Chips and \"Yum Yum\" Noodles with Chicken & for dessert \"Campfire\" Marshmallows.  The Singapore Sling comes in a tall glass, filled with ice and topped with cute garnish. Lovely, refreshing and light. Tropical and fruity, plus with Gin you know it's going to make you feel nice and relaxed, which was exactly what I was going for.  I've had the Smashed Chips and \"Yum Yum\" Noodles before and feel that both are strong in Asian and Spanish flavor. The Sambal chili type of flavor and the Salsa Verde, Avocado & Crema work well in this dish. Very interesting. This is definitely one to share as it is very filling! Hello carbs!  The \"Yum Yum\" Noodles use egg noodles and reminds me of a Mi Goreng meets Pad Thai, pretty good but something I feel you could order at any other Asian restaurant.   The only let down was the \"Campfire\" Marshmallows. Don't get me wrong the presentation was lovely. It was presented with squared marshmallows on pretzel sticks in a wood holder and served with a side of chocolate. The marshmallows were very airy, didn't have much flavor and the \"roasted\" parts seemed soggy like they were pre-made as they were room temp. The pretzels seemed a bit stale, no crunch to them and the chocolate which I was expecting to be a rich, decadent Ghiradelli or high quality chocolate was runny and tasted just like Hershey's syrup. Boo! Do not order this dessert as it was not worth the price.  Besides the dessert here, everything I've had thus far has always been amazing. The service is always spot on and fast. Great spot to hang out with friends and the menu is always eclectic and changing."}
{"text":"The noodles were very goods .  The drinks were a little pricey and weak. Not even sure if there was liquor in them."}
{"text":"On a recent trip to Phoenix, one of my buddies raved about this place! Kept saying, we've gotta go! They've got great mixologists. Coming from San Francisco I was a little skeptical since this city has some pretty amazing mixologists but I thought I would give it a try.   OH-EM-GEE! This place is godsend. Such a big bar area for seating and the restaurant offered some great seating options as well. On my visit, we sat at the end of the bar and really had an awesome time. Here's what you do. When the bartender takes your order, you tell them your favorite drink and why it's your favorite drink. Describe the flavors that you like and what you don't like. I promise, he'll come back with the most amazing cocktail! I don't know the name of it but I told him I LOVE and old fashioned. Also mentioned that I like the orange hint and love anything with whiskey. He came back with gold! The price was certainly reasonable as well.   This place is located in a great part of town and their handcrafted cocktails are on point. If you're in the Phoenix area, you need to try this joint out! The experience is mad crazy!"}
{"text":"I kind of want to write a bad review so I can end up on their \"Yelper of the Week\" board, but it would all be lies. Everything was amazing.  My husband and I came early on a Saturday evening and were seated immediately. The cocktail menu was intimidating- so many choices! I settled on a Tom Collins and he had a strawberry margarita. My cocktail was fantastic! Super refreshing and crisp. My husband's margarita was powerfully strong- not the standard overly sweet, fake tasting, fruit margarita you're used to.  Foodwise, we started with the Grilled Cheese Bites and the Mac + Cheese because cheese. The Grilled Cheese Bites were really good, but they were more like cheesy garlic bread bites (they were open face) with tomato sauce- not the tomato soup the menu described. Still, it was good. The Mac + Cheese, however, stole the show. I think it might be the best Mac + Cheese I've ever had. Creamy, with a nice crispy top. We've actually ordered it from Postmates a few times since, when we feel too lazy to go out.  For our main courses, I had the ramen burger and my husband had fried chicken with watermelon. The ramen burger was good, but I probably wouldn't get it again. Maybe it was the cheesefest I partook in for our appetizer, but I was kind of over the burger after a few bites.  My husband's dish was delicious. I would definitely get it again. Really light and fresh tasting, despite the fact the main ingredient was fried chicken.  I really enjoyed Bitter and Twisted and didn't get a snotty vibe like others referred to. I believe they are also on the NoWait app, so if you want to avoid the wait, just use the app."}
{"text":"I had a Slap & Tickle and my guy had a Jic-Up.  The drinks were amazing; each fusing unexpected elements in a way that elevated everything to liquid art.  Mine was tropical vacation meets back alley booze hound.  His was like a spicy, smoke-infused Jicama bomb went off on your taste buds.  The ambience was dark and sultry; set in the revamped 1924 Luhrs building, Phoenix's first 10 story skyrise.  The waitstaff is smooth and polished.  The process is efficient, checkout happens immediately at table side with tablet card readers.  My only hitch in the whole night was that apparently my eyesight, and his, has deteriorated to the point that their extensive drink menu, as beautiful and detailed as it is, was nearly unintelligible in the dark and sexy setting.   We saw a couple of dorks using their cell phones like a NightSun 2000 to light up the menu, but we aren't that uncool.  Nope, instead we discreetly tipped the tabletop candle dangerously at an angle to pitifully aim the warbly little light source at the menu and ordered the only two drinks we could definitively read the names of.        (The real problem is that once you are old enough to have the extra disposable income to go out and really enjoy yourself you are too old to go out and really enjoy yourself.)"}
{"text":"Such a cool place to munch on food with awesome cocktails! It's rare to find a place that know how to make a real caipirinha so I'm impressed. The food is innovative, but pretty average, even a bit too salty. Overall pricey, but worth it once in a while.  It's a little hard to find street parking, but there are some lots nearby so bring quarters/cash."}
{"text":"I am definitely a fan, I wish I could give this place more than 5 stars.   Their cocktails are on a whole new level, it's hard to stop yourself from ordering a 2nd, 3rd, and 4th round. Try the Solero, Lemongrass Collins, Bramble, Slap 'n Tickle - and the list goes on and on and on.   I've only had a chance to experience bites from the Late Night Menu, but the chicken with watermelon kimchi is so good. I've heard their Ramen burger is bomb.com. Also...Cupcakes infused with liquor!! What?!! Get them before they sell out-trust me, they will!  The ambiance is dark and sexy, great for a date night, but also a great spot for Twisted Tuesdays with friends.   More than anything though, their staff is probably one of the best factors of this place. The bar staff are all not only legit and know their stuff, but they add an element of fun to each experience and make each visit pleasant."}
{"text":"This place is really good! I had the Yum Yum noodles with chicken and it was delicious! I also had the Lovefruit Medley which was recommended by the bartender and if you like fruity drinks, like me, you'll love this one! Everyone in general was very friendly and they definitely made it a great experience."}
{"text":"My review is based on service, or rather I should say- lack there of! Our visit to this bar was one with anticipation and excitement per the reviews. We arrived in a Tuesday night at around 9:30, and to our surprise the bar was pretty empty, yet fully staffed. Out of the 3 bartenders we chose the middle one and sat right in front of him for about 15 minutes, we heard crickets. Any conversation that happened was initiated by us, and we never got offered a drink. After the 15 minutes we walked out and never looked back. Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh- simply said, Bitter and Twisted is one of my favorite go-to places in down town. I usually start a night out with happy hour here.   Here's why:  -Are you kidding me with these delicious drinks? The mixology here is ON POINT -The food is different, and a little \"bougie\" :) Meaning, there is obviously a chef here who cares about what goes on a plate. I have yet to be disappointed in the food.  -The customer service is always awesome -I love the offbeat antiquated, throwback interior -Great music at night -What other bar has fabulous drinks, fantastic food, and a personal NINTENDO at some of the tables for your entertainment!   Go check it out. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The drink menu here is extensive and overwhelming at first. If its your first time i'd recommend looking at the graph in the front and asking your waiter what they'd recommend. Drinks are very well crafted and I've even enjoyed ones that seem like they wouldn't work like the chocolate sazerac."}
{"text":"Service itself gets 4 stars, but everything else gets 5 star.   We came here on a Wednesday evening to celebrate the end of the semester. We got a table immediately. The place looked about half full, at about 10:30 at night!  Initially, our waitress was awesome! She asked what we were interested in. After she claimed to have tried everything on the menu we gave her some of our tastes, and she recommended two cocktails that were perfectly on point. She knew exactly what we were after and delivered! The cocktail menu can be a little overwhelming so this was definitely appreciated. We indulged on the grilled cheese and fries appetizers. The grilled cheese was really tasty. The fries were.... fries. Nothing to write home about, but perfect for that moment.  I'd asked to see one specific bottle of tequila, and the general manager brought it over for us! He was really nice and we had a pretty good conversation.   My issue with the service arose about midnight. We went to order our dessert and a second cocktail. Both were tasty again. But through towards the end of our stay, I realized the place was getting busier and busier. Our waitress was definitely a little overworked, and we saw her less and less. The interactions started to feel short and rushed. I'm not sure if they usually get that full on Wednesday's, but the seemed a little unprepared to handle the full rush!  Overall, we were really happy with our visit! We'll be back again, and all indications are that the servers know what they are doing. I look forward to updating our review to five stars across the board!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite cocktail bar in downtown Phoenix! It's in an awesome location, though parking is found on the street and often metered. The bartenders are all incredibly seasoned and skilled at what they do. The first night I ever went I chatted with the bartender who happened to not only know some of the other bartenders at my other favorite restaurants but was willing to craft original cocktails for me based on my taste preferences.   Going during happy hour will give you the best bang for your buck. Their thrifty cocktails are a good gateway drug to becoming a regular here. It's on the pricier side, with most drinks averaging at about 10$. You can't come here and not eat some of their food. It's mostly Asian fusion, but they manage to do it pretty well. The Typhoon Chicken is some of the best fried chicken EVER. It's super crispy and juicy and it comes with lettuce wraps and watermelon kimchi. It's a must try. The Smashed Chips are great for you if you want to fill up your stomach a little with some starch. The Angry Panda is perfect for spice lovers and also comes with lettuce to wrap and eat like finger food.  The main attraction, the drinks, are a wonder. Their distinct menu takes a while to fully absorb and is filled to the brim with creative cocktails. And if the menu isn't enough for you, they'll pretty much make you any drink under the sun."}
{"text":"This place has the best cocktails in phoenix. Would definitely suggest it to friends and family in the area. The drinks are moderately priced but totally worthwhile!"}
{"text":"A bar built by bartenders. A bar where you will feel like an incompetent asshole if you are not a bartender.   That being said, don't come here for food. This is strictly a cocktail bar. Don't try to make this a dinner place, because their food is def \"eh\".  Those drinks are so good though."}
{"text":"I went here after dinner with a bunch of friends for my birthday. Although we were a large group they made an effort to accommodate us on a night where they were fairly busy. The drinks that we ordered were delicious and the staff was friendly. Will definitely need to go back to try some of the food they have to offer."}
{"text":"This place has definitely improved!  Always liked the atmosphere.  Last 2 times I've gone have been great.  Food is really good and that popcorn addicting! :)"}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  Very solid cocktail bar, very good addition to the downtown scene.  We've been here a few times to eat and drink, last night just to drink.  We got a lemongrass collins and the house punch.  The punch was quite good, very well-balance citrus with the underlying milk notes that its description promises.  Hints of bitter and tart, it was a well constructed cocktail, especially for a punch.  It was also $14 for a teacup full (they actually served it in a teacup, which I did not mind at all).  A little steep for a pre-made cocktail of that size without knowing more about what goes into it.  The lemongrass collins was very good too.  Almost a perfect cocktail with one exception - too much vanilla.  Vanilla sugar goes into the cocktail and the vanilla overwhelms the other great flavors in the drink.  If they reduced the sweetness by 25-45%, this would be a perfect summer cocktail - citrusy, sweet, tart.  We've ordered food here before and I think it's the only place in the Valley that serves a ramen burger.  I've had the original in LA, this one is a good approximation.  It's worth getting.  We've also gotten the Typhoon Chicken and the Yum Yum noodles.  The chicken is crispy in the Typhoon Chicken, pretty well seasoned, but the watermelon kimchi throws it off a bit and soggies it up a little.  The Yum Yum noodles were pretty tasty, a little salty, but good to have along with drinks.  Props to Bitter and Twisted for coming downtown and making a stand and coming up with a very comprehensive and aggressively ambitious cocktail menu.  It's no PDT or Employees Only (both NYC) or Varnish or Edison (both LA) or Canon (in Seattle), but it's a solid cocktail bar worth visiting."}
{"text":"Wow! These drinks are everything you could ever dream of, great innovative flavors and fun combinations you could never come up with on your own. The menu is huge but the knowledgable and friendly servers are there to help you pick the perfect cocktail! The food is wonderful as well! The ramen burger was wonderful! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday night at around 8pm and waited for about 20 minutes.  They have a crazy menu! It's very detailed and very complicated. There are SO many drinks that I couldn't even take pictures of the menu, and the darkness of the bar didn't help. They also have a chart of where each drink falls on a scale from potency and uniqueness. They sell their menus for $20 each if you want to take it home as a souvenir. In addition to the complicated menu, each drink itself has a ton of ingredients. I am actually so impressed that the bartenders are able to remember every drink on the menu as well as each ingredient in each drink.  I ordered the whiskey berry jubilee. It was on the safer side and was very refreshing. We then ordered the L.I.T. Up which is one of their most potent drinks (they limit it to two per guest). They serve it in a coke can which is interesting.  You can come here and order a different drink every time which I think would be so fun to do. It's an experience by itself looking through the menu."}
{"text":"This place sucks, the decor is 1060's moulin Rouge meets sexual deviant frustrated teenage boy. Nice bathrooms though. The drink menu is trying to be cute with the video games...  Try the meat and cheese board it was worth it if you like cat food.   Can't wait to return"}
{"text":"This is an amazing bar with all fresh ingredients. Bar staff is very friendly,funny and pros when it comes to that unusual tasty cocktail. Atmosphere wonderful."}
{"text":"WOW! I have heard amazing things about this jewel of a restaurant for quite awhile and so I took my catering team last night for our Q3 outing and everything was PERFECT! From the fun, creative and colorful drinks menu to the mouthwatering innovative food menu I knew I hit gold! From the minute we walked in we were treated so well by Dan even though we had a few extra unexpected guests! The Smashed Chips, the Seoul Chicken, the Chish and Fips, the Ramen Burger the Grilled Cheese Bites and the Bannaoffe Pudding...OMG...every single bite was beyond delicious and not a crumb was left at our table! Then there was my cocktail...the Porn Star Martini was INCREDIBLE and it made me giggle just ordering it! From start to finish this was one of the best food and hospitality experiences for our team in the last seven years!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! It's vibe and the cool old 20's building with lots of awesome history. Zack, the manager was super attentive and all the staff just keep things moving and are very friendly.  I'm not really the cocktail type, so let my friends order those to try a sip, maybe this place will make me a believer! I'm so in love with the popcorn,  But the Ramen Burger is to die for! I have been craving one everyday now for the past two weeks...time to return!"}
{"text":"The cocktails are interesting and tasty, but what you have here is an establishment that thinks it is the curator of cool and will turn away business for no reason. Now, you may be thinking that we rolled up in sweats, lookin rough, but quite on the contrary. We would have definitely fit the dressy, lounge feel, they just didn't feel like having a group. The door guy, all hopped on the fact he carried an iPad, ignored everyone outside (those not with our party included) and then preceded to haughtily state that the lounge could not accomidate any more patrons as it would be a fire hazard or something. My roommate, in awesome fashion, decided to sort of test this out - and discovered that there were plenty of seats available and that this guy, and this bar, were just dicks. But, he and I made it in to test it out and 1) did verify there was plenty of room, 2) learned that overpriced drinks were kinda lame (and remember, I live in Boulder, and there are a great many overpriced drinks that are actually worth it).   Save yourself the hassle - this place is not worth it. There are now many options in downtown, most or all of which I am sure would love your business and you don't need to worry about gauging the cool-meter with the door guy.  The 2nd star was for drink quality and range of options."}
{"text":"Some of best cocktails I'm phoenix. Mixology and a dim lit ambiance to accompany the vibe. Great staff. Bartenders are on point. I've never had the food but this place is a must for craft cocktail drinkers."}
{"text":"Best night I've had in a while! Me and my girlfriends decided to try out this awesomely named new bar in Phoenix, Bitter and Twisted. We had heard how big this place was going to be and so we made a reservation a few days before planning to go. Upon arrival, it was pretty packed but our table was ready and in a great spot. We were given the cocktail menu and immediately started debating with each other on what we should get. We all like to order different drinks and try them all so we can decide on our favorites. Lets just say we each had about 5 different cocktails out of a selection of 50 plus to  choose from and i must inform you. WE LOVED THEM ALL! I haven't even begun to tell you about the food, which was also incredible. This place is a MUST TRY if your in Phoenix or anywhere near it. FIVE huge stars to this awesome new bar that I am truly calling my favorite new spot to get drinks with my ladies."}
{"text":"I literally have nothing bad to say about this place. The outside of the restaurant/bar does no justice as to what the inside looks like!  The music and ambiance is so chill I can see this instantly becoming a nice kick it spot or just to meet up with some friends.    I had a drink called the accidental connoisseur, and as soon as I sipped it, the flavors went crazy in my mouth.  I am very happy that it was my first drink but I'm sure being the professional mixologist that they are, that all the drinks taste amazing.  The green chilli mac n cheese was fantastic! Don't forget to add the bacon.  Nice size portion that me and my girlfriend shared, was so cheesy and spicy that I want to make it at home..... like everyday!  The service was awesome, they made sure to give us time to look over their menu and to get settled in.  We were checked on by more than one specific server. Which I liked because it didn't give too much time where we were left hanging there, wondering when we would get helped.  I give this spot 5 stars specifically for the the ambiance and music. It's right up my alley with the chill atmosphere! #drinkbetter"}
{"text":"As an addition to the original 5 star rating, these guys ROCK.  I dont believe in god, but OMG i believe this place is awesome.  They make it happen here.   Had a  Vesper and an Aviation.  Both were godlike. The korean nachos and the salad are works of art.  Fried chicken is the bomb.  For sure on my next visit to Phoenix, i will again have dinner here.  And expect to be amazed"}
{"text":"How many time do you need to go to a place to realize it's a lie. 45 minute wait sir, year when you walk in there is so much space at the bar and open tables.  We had our name in and were told we could walk across the street...we got the call and walked back, only to be told to e took too long. 14 min. When we questioned the doorman, we were told we were \"f-ing 86ed\""}
{"text":"Yelped this gem of a place after coming from a packed party across the street. My friends and I wanted somewhere we could sit down, eat, have some cocktails, and actually be able to hear our conversation.  Bouncer/host was very genuine and friendly.   \"Upscale but not pretentious\" was a very accurate description of this lounge, with its high ceilings, tidiness, swanky decor, and comfortable booths that accommodated 6. Seating room only means that your experience will always be intimate yet comfortable, and you won't have to worry about someone stepping on your shoes.  Their drink menu has a table of contents! There's something for everyone here, whether it be a silky smooth La Chocolat Sazerac, or a sweet dessert drink, like the Tiramisu, which literally tastes like its namesake. There's even a page dedicated to the designated drivers. If cocktails aren't your style, there's quite an extensive spirit list in the back of the menu. Our server was extremely helpful when we got stuck on drink choices.  The food here was just as good as their drinks! I had the Ramen Burger--the ramen buns were crisp on the outside, yet al dente on the inside. The burger was cooked perfectly and very tasty. A friend ordered the pork belly which was sweet and succulent. For dessert, we all split two Banoffee Pots, which was a parfait with graham cracker crust, banana, and English toffee pudding, topped with whipped cream.   When we were leaving, the manager/owner capped off our experience with a warm smile and sincere thanks.   All of us were floored at how awesome our entire experience here was. I'll definitely be back when I'm in Phoenix again!"}
{"text":"I am a sucker for a place with a good atmosphere and drink selection. This place has both. We found it after dinner and saw they do a waitlist when it's crowded. I appreciate that you don't have to wait outside of it like a night club. They simply send a text when it's ready. That allowed us to visit a few other bars during our stay-cation.  The menus were available for purchase and while that may sound strange, you would understand when you see them. They are truly works of art. It's a book of cocktails with each page done like a children's literary book. Illustrations of pirates on the rum cocktails are just an example.   The creativity of the menu lived up to the promise once the drinks arrived. They even had selections of liquor that you could try not in a mixed drink, I found a new polish vodka that I like. If in Phoenix for another overnight stay, I would make a trip to this place again."}
{"text":"Great cocktail bar in downtown Phoenix.    Make reservations if you are in a larger group.  They did call us when our table was ready.  We got there a little early and the place was packed.    As for drinks, top notch cocktails and the food was actually great.  I enjoyed the s'mores at the end."}
{"text":"This place is a must if you love cocktails and tasty small plates. I loved my first visit so I was excited to return. Nikki was our server, she was so great at recommending menu items, and wonderful cocktails to go with. Happy hour ends at 7 and there is a fun daily cocktail that hit the spot. We ordered the popcorn, which has an Asian twist, excellent. The mac and cheese is delicious as is the spicy chicken appetizer. A drink called the Porn star was stellar, and the GM stopped by to make sure we were happy. We've all been servers, so we know that respect gets you better service and we got it. The bar sits inside the old Luhrs building so the ambiance is steeped with history. The drink menu is about 10 pages and changes yearly. It is a work of art, so interesting and colorful. There are cocktails for non- drinkers as well. I can't wait to return and try something new!"}
{"text":"Interesting atmosphere and interesting cocktails. I'd like to try one of them all! In due time I suppose. It was interesting to watch the bartenders and they selected a dead-on combination for me that was amazing. Gin, Selmer, house cucumber syrup and wafer thin cucumber slices. Refreshing and tasty. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Ok- do love the place in person- but loved the fact that Uber eats could deliver hurricane popcorn on request.  My 3rd star rating is due to Bitter & Twisted dropping off of food delivery services. Seriously- the food is great! It's very sad that we can't get their delicious burgers or popcorn and pay them $$.   Please please please come back on a food delivery service app. Thank you!"}
{"text":"The cocktail menu here is amazing. Tons of options, impeccably made old fashioned drinks. Delicious and different bar snacks. Perfect for happy hour, date night, or a pre-game drink (or 3!)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  We were in town visiting from Los Angeles and I wish this bar was in LA!  We would go back all the time if we could!  The menu was fun and delightful, waitresses were super fun and helpful in helping us figure out a drink. Drinks were delicious, strong, and tall.  I had their popular berry drink which tasted like juice but was quite strong!  Everyone enjoyed their drinks.  We also ordered the pork belly buns which were great!  I love these buns and I'm always excited when a place has them.  The pork belly was a bit fatty, but everything tasted so good, I overlooked that part.  I wish we were hungry enough to try the ramen burger!"}
{"text":"I REALLY want to give this place five stars, but because of the service that we recieved I can't.  SERVICE: Came here for my first time as part of a birthday dinner for a close friend. We went on a Friday night & you cannot make reservations here, so we expected a wait & thats fine. I guess they were abnormally busy due to a company Holiday party, & they told us that in the beginning too, so again the wait was acceptable.  Once we were finally seated, our first server indicated they were out of several popular dishes, gave us our menus & walked away. Anybody that knows Bitter & Twisted knows the menu is a little overwhelming (which I love all the options) but I would expect a little explanation on the servers part (or at least some recommendations?). We actually ended up having ANOTHER server come over to check on us & see if our orders were taken, & she was awesome-- friendly, smiling, made recommendations, & actually ended up telling us that they could make some of the food that we were told initially they were out of (thanks to her, because if we didnt have her my rating would be less.) Server #1 periodically came to check in, but again we had to ask a bunch of probing questions to get anything out of her & she just acted a little inconvenienced..  FOOD/DRINK: I ordered the whiskey berry jubilee & also participated in the duck bathtub/fishbowl drink. Both were tasty, fun, & gave me a nice buzz! We also ordered a couple rounds of shots in the dark (which are different shots by the bartender). Those were also very tasty & I liked both the ones we got. For food I got the green chile mac n cheese-- AMAZING!! It wasnt over/under cheesy or greasy. The taste was rich & had a kick to it.  I will definitely be back because I loved the vibe, food & drinks. I just hope ALL of servers can be a little more consistent :)"}
{"text":"Cocktails were good food was on point but the waitress did not look up past her ipad 1 single time there was no interaction there was no greeting we were all just seat numbers at the table and we proved it when we moved seats and they deliver the food and drinks to the wrong person ! That waitress did not deserve the 18% tip which i might add was the smallest amount you could tip.. Maybe retrain your staff to actually converse with your customers.."}
{"text":"Hands down the best cocktail bar I have ever been to! Part of me wants to write a crappy review so I can get featured as the \"Yelper of the Week\"--probably one of the funniest things I've ever seen. I absolutely love the vibe this place gives off. You will have a hard time finding a place with better drinks in Arizona. Plus our server was the sweetest."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a few drinks. Whiskey Sours were amazing. They have some great mixologist. We did munch on some Hurricane Popcorn that was very tasty. Prices of the drinks are pricey."}
{"text":"First time here and the drinks are amazing! Great employees and great atmosphere! And the green chili mac with bacon is amazing!! Definitely going to come back again! It's definitely a drive but well worth it!"}
{"text":"What a beautiful building and awesome atmosphere.   Cocktails are over the top and music is super cool.  Great vibe all around.    Love the preservation of the historic building.    Food is great and good price point."}
{"text":"The art of making a superb cocktail has resurfaced in Phoenix!!! Quality spirits combined with fresh ingredients and housemade syrups, purees, foams etc. makes for magic in a glass.  The passion they put into making each drink is evident from first sip.  The bar bites resemble an Anthony Bourdain special and add to the overall experience.  The staff is friendly and are very passionate about their craft.  The environment is superb with trendy decor combined with unique art.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The ambiance of this speak easy is so cute. There's a drink for everyone! The menu can be a little overwhelming, but all great and interesting drink choices for a fun cocktail night out. Also, tried s few things on the dinner menu and wasn't obsessed with anything but it was decent!"}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving this a three star is because our bartender was not very pleasant. The atmosphere is fun. The drinks are amazing. The food is delightful and I will definitely be back. Hopefully the bartender this time will be much more attentive and helpful. When we came in it wasn't very busy at all yet the bartender acted like we were bugging him when we asked questions about the menu. We had to wait for a while to finally place our order. We had to wait even longer to order our second round and then more waiting to get our check. It wasn't until it came time to sign our receipt that he finally apologized for not being more attentive and checking on us more often. Thanks for waiting until it was time to fill out your tip buddy. Smh.... I never am one to complain or leave a mediocre review. But this really was very distasteful customer service. Let's hope our next stop in is much better."}
{"text":"All I need is good company, good food and good drinks, and last night at Bitter & Twisted delivered on all three.  The interior is a very cool paired back modern industrial feel that reminded me of a bar you'd find in downtown Seattle. Dimly lit, high back comfortable booths, frosted windows and chandeliers lend a glamorous low key speak easy feel.  I ordered a different drink on every round (and there were several ;) and I enjoyed every expertly made one. The drinks take center stage here with a booklet of many signature cocktails available, but the food was pretty amazing too- we had the Betelnut pork belly (think super amazing high end Chinese delivery ribs with red sauce), the Ramen burger (it was cray), the meat and cheese board (house made pate and bacon and brussel sprout spread), and the angry panda lettuce wraps (a bit too \"angry\" for my partner so be warned if you aren't into spicy, but very tasty).   I know some Yelp reviewers complain about price at B & T but I think some of us Phoenicians are unaccustomed to having a high end big city bar in our downtown. I found the $6-$12 drinks to be extremely reasonable as compared to other metropolitan bars, but drinks are of much better quality. And I know waiting outside for a table isn't fun, but it makes for a much more relaxed atmosphere not to be jammed into a bar with a bunch of people waiting around. You can go into any dive bar to walk immediately up to the bar and order a cheap drink- that's not what this is.  We all thoroughly enjoyed the experience and are looking forward to returning- highly recommended if you're looking for a more discriminating night out."}
{"text":"Went to Bitter and Twisted on a Friday, ready to kick off the weekend and had the most bizarre experience. When we came up to the hostess she asked in a rude tone, without looking up from her book, \"How many?\" My husband replied, \"Two\", and as she looked at her book, she continued to fail to acknowledge me. OK, whatever. \"Follow me.\" she said curtly. When we entered the establishment, there literally was more than a dozen open seats at the bar. She proceeded to sit us alllllll the way at the end of the bar. Okay? When she left, we were completely puzzled and appalled at what just happened. Why was she so rude? Why did she seat at us the most inconvenient seats in the restaurants? Our bartender was nice and the drinks were good, (we had the mojitos) but the hostess gave us such a bad taste, we proceeded to leave pretty soon after. We asked for her name (Kaitlyn) and when she gave it to us, she chased us out of the place, saying loudly and following us out the door, \"WAS THERE A PROBLEM? DO YOU NEED TO SPEAK TO A MANAGER?\" Again, what? We've been to Bitter and Twisted so many times, and while this has never happened before, it does leave me wondering if we will return."}
{"text":"Their drinks are so delicious! I've been here a few times and I've never had an issue with any of the drinks I've ordered. Their cupcakes are delicious too! That's about the only good I've had there. The service and staff are all great! The atmosphere of the bar is comfortable. Everything is really clean - including the bathrooms! It's an upscale bar that makes delicious drinks. Would definitely recommend going here!"}
{"text":"This is a fun place to visit with friends. I'm going to start off saying they have a drink that is served in a bath tub with rubber ducks. Yes, I said a Bath Tub! Went with a large group of friends and someone thought it would be awesome to order. We were out for a celebration so why not it was fun experience,  but it did have a nice little price tag. If my memory is correct about $50, but  I guess you can't put a price on the experience because it's priceless, right?!?  Anyway, aside from the Bath Tub drink it was a great place to hang out and grab drinks. The place is pretty small and intimate but they were super accommodating for our large group. I think we were running at least 12 deep. It was a tight squeeze but we made it work.   The service was pretty awesome and they had a very extensive drink menu so a great place to try new drinks or just stick with your usual old faithful.   Be warned that on the Friday and Saturday (not sure about Sunday) but they do not take reservations; however, before you head to the restaurant you are able to use Yelp to place yourself on the waitlist. The negative is the Yelp waitlist only works for a group of 6 or less. The positive, if you have a larger party you can give them a call and they can place you on the waitlist. I would definitely recommend trying to get on a waitlist if you have a large party.   Anyway, all in all it was such a fun experience and  a place worth checking out."}
{"text":"The bartender my friend and I had there a few weekends ago was hilarious and a very talented guy. We told him what we liked and he made us fabulous, off the menu drinks. The atmosphere and music is great. Bitter and Twisted is now one of my favorite places to get a cocktail in all of AZ! The horrible Yelp reviews posted on the wall there are pretty funny too, way to have a sense of humor! Would give more stars if I could:)"}
{"text":"I was happy before we even received our food or drink. The menu was a creative storybook full of cocktails and I ordered the special. The cocktails are pricey but it's worth it. We all tried one another's drink choices at the table and it seems you can't go wrong. Food options are limited (especially in comparison to drink options), but I was not disappointed. I had the yum yum noodles which were quite good and one of my friends let me try her Mac and cheese and that was really good. Definitely give this place a try. And how cool is the name of the restaurant?"}
{"text":"If you are looking for amazing hand crafted cocktails. They have over 60 types! I came with a group of friends Saturday night. There was plenty of seating for our group of 7. Everyone ordered something different. The drinks were small and flavorful. This place is pricey so it's definitely a place to grab one or two drinks before heading out to your main event. Very nice atmosphere and great service."}
{"text":"AWesome drinks and very \"different\" service. Wasn't warm and inviting encessarily but the place is called Bitter and Twisted so its all good.   Drinks were solid."}
{"text":"this place has the best drinks!!! so good and shrimp and grits to die for. also got a salad and more drinks!!!"}
{"text":"This place has a lot of rules: 1. You cannot wait inside if there are no seats available, even though when you go inside there is plenty of standing space near the ATM.  There is not standing at the bar, or around the tables. 2. If you have a party more than 4, and you want to split a check per what you ordered, this will not be accommodated.  You will have to split it evenly.  This got very awkward for my group of friends because we all ordered very different things.  Luckily some of our party had cash so the four of us that didn't could pay for what we bought. 3. They do not take reservations between 4 and 8pm 4. There is a $10 minimum for a card charge, but luckily the drinks are $9-11 dollars, so you should be ok.  I've been here twice.  Once was on a Thursday around 7pm.  We were told we couldn't have a reservation till after 8.  When I arrived at 7, the place was empty and luckily they sat us.  The second time was last Saturday (labor day weekend) and we were told it was a 2 hour wait for a cocktail... not dinner... so we went to another bar in cityscape.  So the first time I was able to actually get in was ok.  The drink menu is fun.  Tons of options and there was a fantastic graph on the back to help guide you if you wanted something exciting, sweet, traditional, or savory.  My cocktails were great, no complaints.  I was really excited to have a fun, new, cocktail place in phoenix so things were looking up.  The food menu has some left to be desired, but if you treat this as a place to get a drink vs. getting dinner, then you'll be fine.  The food was good though, just not a great variety.  1.  I had the patte with bread, very yummy. 2.  The Ramen Burger... well that was disappointing.  Yes, it says that there is a lot of sauce on it (\"extra napkins\"), but it really did over power the burger.  I could barely taste the beef or the ramen... really they acted like conduits for the sauce which wasn't that memorable.   3. My plain fries, a side that is separate, were really good.  I would like to have a cocktail and these fries every time I come here. 3.  The loaded friends looked really good and my friends enjoyed them  We all liked being there, and I wanted to go back and introduce other friends to bitter and twisted (hence last Saturday) but they just make it too hard.  Also considering there is the blue hound, arrogant butcher and squid ink in walking distance (all have great cocktails and food).  I will try to come back again, I just hope they accommodate customers a little better."}
{"text":"Very fun place for a drink. My husband and I were doing a beer crawl and almost skipped this one. I'm so glad we didn't. Bartenders look like they are creating art. Had a couple snacks - grilled cheese was good but not great, but the pork belly tacos were FANTASTIC. My only complaint is the false advertisement of Cupcakes on the board. Our bartender informed us that they only make the cupcakes on Tuesday and, \"they usually sell out that same day.\"  Maybe they should increase how many they make or make them more than one day a week.  No matter, we will return."}
{"text":"Among the best Old Fashioneds I've ever enjoyed.  I really hope this place gets the support it deserves.  Amazing location!"}
{"text":"This place is about as cool as it's  cliche name would suggest.  It's like they ordered everything from a \"cool trendy bar\" mailorder magazine based in Florida.  The cocktails are descent but they aren't nearly as good as they should be if they are gonna call themselves a cocktail \"purveyor.\"  They also manufacture lines outside the bar when everyone knows there is plenty of space inside.  Downtown Phoenix does not have the nightlife that old town has, and if you want to make it as big as old town, don't make people wait outside for 45 minutes for no reason other than to try and make your bar look cool.  Most people told they have to wait are walking away and the bar is losing business.    The menu is also way too big for a truly great cocktail bar.  Felt like i was at the cheesecake factory.   All that being said, the space they have is amazing."}
{"text":"Some of the best drinks in town! If your ever in down down phoenix, and looking for drinks, this place is must. They have amazing drinks and the food is delish as well. If you do get food, I highly recommend the ramen burger...I know it sound odd but it is so yummy. All of the drinks Ive tried have also been very good. They have a huge menu of cocktails, and it can be a little over whelming.  As for the atmosphere it is very dark and upscale. I would absolutely recommend this place for either a date night or a night out with friends."}
{"text":"One of the best Cocktail bars ever. Most of this place works like a well oiled machine.   They make sure that they keep the barstools free from crowds by having a doorman check you in for the bar or table seating.   If you sit at the bar your drinks will be expertly crafted for you in a timely manner. Their drink menu is deep and everything I've ordered in my numerous trips here have been consistently delicious. They're priced a bit higher than average for the area, but they are perfectly made and worth every penny.   The yum yum noodles and popcorn are reliable choices for tasty bar snacks.   If you sit at a table, it's the same food and drinks, just with much slower service since their wait staff isnt all that motivated to be quick or attentive.   But even with that shortcoming, it's still one of my favorite places to get a cocktail ever."}
{"text":"Hahaha. Love this place. Everything about it. I laugh because they make fun of \"pretentious Yelpers\" you know the ones who are \"foodies\" overnight and try to bash establishments instead of giving them useful info. I love the food here as it is very creative. Cocktails are amazing. Phoenix needs fun bars with a great vibe like this. Well done B&T."}
{"text":"This place is very out of place for the downtown I know and love. I've been here a few times and on a couple of occasions they've made me wait outside to get a table for dinner, a la nightclub life. Then to get in finally and see other empty tables. It's also silly that a perfect location spot for after work drinks doesn't allow bar open seating. One of the best parts of going to dinner is grabbing a drink at the bar first. The food is okay, the saving grace is the drinks!"}
{"text":"This review is based on the cocktails alone. They were all superb!!! The party I came here with were all super impressed with all of their cocktails and martinis. They are handcrafted and done right. The drink menu can be a bit overwhelming, but I don't think you can pick something that isn't good. I will definitely return for the amazing cocktails and I will also have to try the food!"}
{"text":"Terrific cocktails! !!  Fun, creative and delicious.  So delicous.  I am a wine girl and I am still thinking about those drinks. Great atmosphere too.  The food is good but not my favorite.   Good snacking foods to go along with such delicious cocktails :-)"}
{"text":"Restaurant agréable, bon cocktail, tres bon fish & chips, service soigné! Le dumpling burger vaux le detour également ! On aime !"}
{"text":"Great mixologists creating delicious drinks but no hospitality exhibited!  More of a Locals place. Would have given it 5 stars but for the lack of a welcome. As a Sommelier in training, it was an enjoyable experience,  a culinary experience, nonetheless."}
{"text":"I have been praying for a perfect cocktail bar to open up in Phoenix since I moved here in 2009, and 5 years later, God finally answered my prayers.    My friend and I walked in around 5:30 on Thursday to find the bar about half full. We were both impressed by the high ceilings and the overall feel of the interior, and I kinda wished that we had dressed up more for the occasion.  But, the staff didn't seem to mind our flip flops and my ripped up Guns 'n Roses t-shirt, so we gladly stayed.    Interestingly, I recently read an article about the bar's reservation policy, but it didn't reflect our experience at Bitter & Twisted.  No one asked if we had reservations, and everyone was friendly.   We sat at the bar and were given a food menu and a booklet for the cocktails.  We did arrive during happy hour (4-7pm) but decided to get a meat and cheeseboard instead which is not a part of their HH special.  The pineapple sauce and the cauliflower in turmeric were my favorite on the board, and the bread was toasted just right.  I was being a snooper and looked at other customers' plates, and they all looked equally delicious.  I would love to try their \"Seoul Fried Chicken\" on my next visit and see if it really tastes like fried chicken from back home.    As for the cocktails, WOW. At the first glance, the cocktail booklet can be a bit overwhelming with written descriptions and pictures.  However, the bartender told us to look at the scatter plot at the back of the booklet that organized everything on one page.  I am a scientist.  Scientists like booze and scatter plots.  Therefore, I like booze and scatter plots.  I chose a refreshing, fruity cocktail while my friend asked the bartender to make her a citrus based martini with jalapenos.  They were both phenomenal in a different way.    My goal for this year is to try every single cocktail on their menu.  I highly recommend Bitter & Twisted to those who have been itching for a new hangout place just like me."}
{"text":"Cool place for cocktails.  Waitress, Barbie  was awesome.  Crazy drink menu.  Also tired the pop corn which was awesome."}
{"text":"After doing a little bar hopping in downtown Phoenix and going in and out of bars playing nothing but hip hop and serving shock top in a plastic cup as their fancy beer I was beginning to think that this was all Phoenix had to offer.   Then we came across Bitter and Twisted and I was pleased to walk into a cocktail bar that served great crafted cocktails. Bartender happily poured me an egg white whiskey sour which was not on their menu and customized a drink to my friends liking.   Not the cheapest place to get a drink in town but if you are grown and appreciate quality versus quantity then this is the place for you.   Cheers!"}
{"text":"I love their drinks, but absolutely horrible customer service. By choosing a drink that's not the waiter's preference, we inadvertently became \"that customer\". It took us over 30 mins to get a drink,despite politely asking several times. I would not expect this from a place I've been to plenty of times before. We had to wait another 30 mins to get my waitress' attention to get our check. Please don't employ waitresses that are rude to customers. We are all just having a day and in the end, want to end it happy."}
{"text":"A nice addition to the Phoenix bar scene. Spacious, classy, attractive and comfortable. I walked in as a newcomer feeling a little under-dressed, but it wasn't detrimental to my experience there at all. The menu is quite large, but your fondness (or less so) of this place may depend on your preference for drinks. I accidentally ordered two of (what must be) the sweetest drinks on the menu. The descriptions didn't do much to warn me, but luckily they were tasty anyway. If you like sweet drinks, this place is a no-brainer.  The menu is, indeed, quite large. I'm certain there are drinks of different flavors and strengths mixed in there, but the descriptions can be a tad ambiguous. Since knowing the ingredients isn't really enough to gauge how strongly flavored the drinks are. Sitting at the bar and being able to directly ask the bartender seems like a smart idea.  The food is quite good. The fish and chips (named something annoyingly cute like \"chish and fips\") were wonderful. After one of us ordered it, we each ended up ordering the same plate because it just hit the spot.  A detriment to this place, though, is the service. It was a busy evening, but they're not super attentive with refilling your drinks or taking drink orders in a timely fashion if you're at a table - which is curious, for a place that makes so much of their profit from selling drinks. Servers were polite, but definitely not super friendly. They seemed a bit standoffish, like they wouldn't be rude, but they weren't making much effort to be very outgoing, either. If there was a downside to our lovely evening, if was the lack of warm service.   PS: This place ain't cheap. I dropped more money here than I've spent at a bar in a while. Cocktails easily range from $10-12, but they have a few specials to keep a look out for. And they don't allow any standing room guests (from what I've heard), so you'll want to make a reservation (or come in early, to wait) if this place is on your list during a busy weekend."}
{"text":"Super fun! Speak easy in old building downtown Phoenix that used to house the prohibition headquarters. Original architecture and structure highlighted. Great for folks from out of town"}
{"text":"You know what's bitter and twisted? Calling this vintage cocktail parlor-themed restaurant/bar mitzvah party/late night Vegas hotel joint nonsense a cocktail parlor.   Of course, my imagination had me like... dark, smoky New Orleans-hotel-bar circa 1910? Just let me grab my brand new cigarette holder, darling.  *record spins to a scratchy stand-still*  Fast-forward: It's 2015, and the most consumable thing at this restaurant is a ramen burger. A gastropub-tastic, spicy, juicy burger between crisp ramen patties, served with moist wipes for your sauce-covered paws. The tagine, which was was described to us as having \"Moroccan sauce on it,\" was also a contender. (Vivid description provided by suspender-clad angel.)  But wait - the drinks! The corpse reviver reminded me of weak jungle juice delivered in a glass vessel. The Ramos gin fizz was perfectly mediocre, but isn't on the menu, and was served in about 5 minutes (as in, no shaker boy spent more than 30 seconds shaking it.) Welp, we definitely ain't in New Orleans, anymo'.  The tagline is \"drink better,\" but some of us would have to first drink far worse in order to drink better at B&T."}
{"text":"My latest favorite downtown watering hole.  They are masters in the art of mixology.  Simple quality ingredients blended with quality liquor (as an example their \"well\" bourbon is Buffalo Trace), they pride themselves on consistency.    The drinks are handcrafted and priced very reasonably, from $6 to $16 on average, based on how high on the shelf you like to drink.  They can make you a simple Vodka Soda if that is your thing but take a look at their extensive drink menu or tell them what your favorite base liquor is and what you don't  like and they will mix something up for you.  They offer a selection of canned and bottle beers if that is your thing and several wines including a few wines on tap.      B&T has Happy Hour daily from 4-7p which had several drink and food specials.   They offer up several tasty food items.  Thus far I have had the opportunity to try the Seoul Fried Chicken (watermelon kimchi,  yes please, it is light and tart complementing the chicken very well) and have stared longingly at their pork belly entree.  Also check out their specials board for weekly drink specials and the latest \"Mad Yelper\" quote.   This place is no dive but it is FAR from pretentious.  Their drinks only look fufu or cloyingly sweet, you should never judge a book by its cover.   If you are looking to get 'crunk' and only like to drink bud light and do shots of fireball I recommend you stick to Hooters or Tilted Kilt.  If you are looking for a relaxed unpretentious atmosphere and a couple of quality craft beverages DO stop in."}
{"text":"I've come here many times for birthdays. I've always loved the atmosphere and the cocktails. However, this year I planned a birthday party for my boyfriend at the last minute. As usual, people pop in and out at birthday parties. When a friend surprised us unexpectedly, we were told that they had sit away from us because we couldn't have more than 8 at a table. We had 9. The staff was rude, unaccommodating and our extra guests ended up leaving right after arriving (after searching for parking for 20 minutes). NOT OKAY. We have spent so much money here this evening and an extra chair wasn't possible? This bar has gotten too big for its britches."}
{"text":"So FUN! Amazing bartender named Tim. Delicious after dinner drinks. Loved the relaxed but trendy atmosphere."}
{"text":"Wholly yumminess - I was in town for a conference and decided to stop in. I sat at the bar and after looking at the overwhelming menu for a few minutes - I just asked the bar tender to make me any drink. He was incredible. My first drink was a Chocolate Sazerac, then a Gin Fashioned, then the Honey bear drink. All three were absolutely phenomenal and so creative. I've never had drinks like that before so it was a nice experience. Decently priced for a good, \"spirit forward\" drink!"}
{"text":"I had been really looking forward to bringing friends here but the evening fell short. We arrived mid happy hour and service with our waitress started off well. But by 6:20 we stopped seeing our waitress.... Or at least we stopped seeing her at our table. We were a party of seven but another larger party came in and she started serving instead. After asking for some assistance another waitress came to get our orders (25 minutes later). She was rude, did not smile and was just very unpleasant. We decided to cut our visit short and asked for our check which of course had added gratuity. I understand if our waitress needed to help a larger table but the lack of communication and basic customer service has unfortunately turned me off to returning here."}
{"text":"Fab drinks, great food and excellent service & company with Russ!  We were looking for a drink while in town and wandered here - for Chicago fans, I'd say it's got a violet hour meets headquarters vibe - door guy controlling how many come in and out so you're not crowded at the bar, menu and tvs with old school Mario games.  Russ was great at recommending drinks based on what I usually drink since there were so many options. Definitely try the Mac and cheese and the popcorn - so good!"}
{"text":"Good but overrated.  A very decent if less than outstanding bar, decent food and decent urban ambience.  Recommended provided one disregards the trendy yuppie vaporings."}
{"text":"Fun place with yummy cocktails & a great food menu as well. Very \"hipster\" and mixology-ish, but worth it. My only complaint would be the setup of their drink menu- it is video game themed (random) - and hard to read due to super small & thin font with funky colors. Cute space though. Def worth a visit! If you like spicy cocktails, the Born Tequila was amazing!"}
{"text":"This place has awesome unique cocktails. The wait time to get into the bar was pretty long but worth it. Drink prices are a little on the higher end up but definitely very tasty."}
{"text":"Very dissiappointed.  Very rude barteneders.  They act like they are gods gift to humanity but are really snotty mouthed punks."}
{"text":"Great drinks, funny sarcastic bartender Tim I think his name was. Portions worth your money!"}
{"text":"Amazing selection of cocktails and bevvies of all kinds! Great staff, would recommend downloading the Nowait app so you can get your party in without waiting for a table. Really adorable themed menu, Hemingways Demise is my hearty recommendation if you like whiskey based drinks but honestly there are so many drinks on the menu you will find your perfect drink here! The lighting is pretty low and it can be a bit noisy but I highly recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"Great utilization of a space that needed to be reborn. Seating setup is versatile-cozy for a couple or select a giant booth for groups. Drink menu is a bit overwhelming as it's pages of options but loved what we ordered. Service was friendly. Lots of staff on a busy Friday night. However, made us wait at bar for a table and when they sat us we saw that there were plenty of open tables in the seated area-seemed pretentious"}
{"text":"There's a reason Bitter & Twisted is so popular: The drinks are exquisite. Created with much love and infinite attention to detail they are served with reverence.   Promptly at 4pm this wonderful bar opens. On one muggy day some friends and I met outside. (It's very easy to become friends when in pursuit of air conditioning.) Eager to quench my thirst I began to ponder the robust menu. (Too many choices!) But just then my eyes spied the cheater's way out: A daily cocktail. Described on the far wall in chalk.  And so I cheated. (I was very, very thirsty.)  Faced with such a diverse menu I was rewarded with a cheat sheet. Bitter & Twisted offers a grid to guide you along your merry way. (I won't spoil it for you, but they make drinking a no brainer.) Food treats are available for snacking. There's danger in starting with with their hurricane popcorn or grill chili mac. Drink a few Porn Star martinis and suddenly you've inhaled their pork belly buns, followed by campfire marshmellows. Hypothetically of course.  Seating is first come, first serve. So hurry to nab a spot. And should you consider partying the rest of the night beer and spirits are available to go. TO. GO."}
{"text":"Awesome drinks, awesome service, awesome cupcake!  We will definitely be going back often."}
{"text":"Your not being truthful now Ross. We watched you question nobody after us!!!!   As mid age business men not young concert goers, your excuses match your arrogance. Your style and energy are poor examples of how a business should be run. Hospitality is obviously not your strength.  Cool space, weak selective service and excuses!! Bitter and Selective!!!! Good luck in the future"}
{"text":"Had the best time there last night. Our waitress was a doll and extremely helpful in recommending cocktails and food. I had two vodka based cocktails, one with carrot juice and ginger, and they were both amazing. Some of the best cocktails I've ever had! We shared a few things.. nachos, Mac and cheese and the ramen burger. Everything was tasty but I'd say the nachos were the best of the three."}
{"text":"The hours stressed me out a little because every time I wanted to go it wasn't opened. Don't worry, third try is the charm! It's everything I want downtown Phoenix to become. Clever cocktail names, exposed brick and cement columns, friendly wait staff AND food service until 2:00!!   It's a bit pricey so I wouldn't go for more than one or two drinks. Great spot to start the evening."}
{"text":"Customer service is definitely not a priority at this establishment, in fact, they are doing you a favor by allowing you to be in their presence. We were \"greeted\" rudely by a hostess to be told that because there was going to be a 30 minute wait due to the fact that there were two of us and only one seat at the bar. They do not allow standing by the bar because we were later told \"they didn't want men hitting on other men's girlfriends.\" She advised us to go across the street or elsewhere for approximately 30 minutes until we received a text.   We went to the rooftop bar directly across the street, ordering drinks and then received our text immediately after. Having to quickly drink those and close out, we literally ran across the street to grab our now ready table. But wait, we had ten minutes to get back and we were there in 12 minutes. Literally TWO minutes late. We were told again that we had to wait because they gave our table away.   When finally sat we were informed we could only order certain food items off of the menu due to the kitchen being backed up. We waited 30 minutes for 1/2 of our party to get water... I could go on with the level of customer service. The upside ... My one cocktail I was able to enjoy due to timing before having to get to our event, was good."}
{"text":"Ok guys, here's the deal. It seems that a lot of people came in opening day and were turned off by the craziness. I get that. But give this place another try! I went here yesterday at around 4 (when they open) to check out their happy hour. Their happy hour is very good, it includes one special drink of the week (this week was a vodka based bramble with blackberry) for 6$ and a page of their 'market' cocktails for 6$ ( these include your choice of fruit in a caipirinha, collins, frozen marg, or mojito). You really can't beat that. Additionally, they have great beer specials (schlitz for 3$... the husband was happy), food specials (most items discounted), and the happy hour lasts until 7!!! Even on Saturday!! How awesome is that?   Now that that is settled, I will tell you about my experience. The husband and I went yesterday. We sat at their very pretty and large bar. The owner was mixing cocktails and came over, shook our hands, introduced himself, and was generally pleasant (and the accent... love it). I started with their lemongrass collins (not on HH, but it had ginger so I had to try it... 10$) - this is a solid drink. It is humongously large, gingery and fresh tasting. I was a fan. The husband got the white russian (which, like all of their classic cocktails can be made at 3 levels of booze quality - economy (10$), business class (or something else clever?) (12$), and first class (or something) (16$). He had the basic, and he liked it, but it wasn't his favorite russian ever. Anyway, then I had the special bramble (HH - 6$) - so delicious. I would definitely get this again. Then, against my better judgment, I ordered the tiramisu martini (12$). This thing was like dessert... chocolatey and creamy from the use of mascarpone cheese with a slight coffee and, of course, booze flavors... it was good stuff. At this point, I had certainly had enough and was feeling just fine. We left after paying our bill of about 40$... 40$ for 5 drinks is not bad guys... especially for hand crafted specialty cocktails. This is not your typical neighborhood bar, this is not applebees or wherever... it is not outrageous to ask 10$ for a drink. I encourage you to check this lovely new bar out, I will certainly be back!  PS I have now been back every week for like 2 months.... the cocktails of the week have been generally successful, with my favorites being the strawberry lemonade cocktail and the orange concoction... so good and dangerous... The people who work here are true professionals, the bartenders and owner recognize us, remember our interests so we can have good conversations, and are just generally friendly and down to earth people. They truly care about cocktails and you can tell by the way they talk about them. But the real reason I'll continue coming back.....  Ramen. Burger. This thing is legit. I told a bar mate (that I didn't know) that this burger tastes like pure joy.  It is messy and packs a ton of flavor. It is savory and has (I know this sounds ridiculous) umami flavors and some good spiciness... combine that with the crunchiness of the fried ramen bun.... you can't beat it.   Other food items here just don't compare... the pork belly is good, but if you eat the whole thing by yourself, it's too much of the same flavor, the fried chicken is also alright, but nothing crazy delicious. The smashed chips are very good (and a good deal on happy hour). The potatoes come out crispy and delicious with several sauces including a spicy sauce, a horseradish sauce, and a green herby sauce. It's overall a tasty dish. But seriously... just get the Ramen Burger, you'll be happy."}
{"text":"Now that's more like it!  We came from another bar a few blocks away that was horrifically disappointing. We found this gem while sitting at the other place plotting our escape. Bitter and Twisted? Sounds like fun! And we weren't disappointed!  Fun atmosphere, professional yet friendly staff, great drinks, fantastic music.. I visit Phoenix a lot, but this made me wish there was one of these establishments in my home state.  The sci-fi nerd in me was beaming at the drink menu. I was bouncing in my seat. The classic sci-fi artwork, the non-alcoholic drink section with the classic huge red glowing computer eye titled \"I'm sorry I can't do that, Dave\" (Hats off to you, Hal.)    I asked the waitress to make me her favorite cocktail or martini. I was introduced to The Bohemian - if any of you readers like a dirty martini, I suggest giving this unique twist a go. And have fun!  It seems to be what the place is all about!"}
{"text":"I love seeing the bad reviews for this place. If you look, it's people from Scottsdale expecting crappy edm and to have their butts kissed. They wine that the drinks were pricey, but these are the same people wanting \"the hook up\" and they act like idiots, don't tip and think they are special.  And they are special. SpongeBob Bicycle helmet, reflector vest and training wheels special. They ask the bartender to seat them, then get mad when the bartender is busy...being a bartender. If you want it your way, Burger King is up the street. Please, just go to your crappy overcrowded bar, and order your Bud Light or vodka soda...not specifying the type of vodka as you're a baller on a budget. Please just stop, it's obvious you've never worked in the industry and have no idea how a decent bar works. Stick with Scottsdale or Vegas, leave Paris, Monte Carlo and Bitter and Twisted to people that will appreciate it.   With the exception of one person who left a review, the rest of the \"bad\" reviewers are just that. I visited their pages and every review they gave for every higher end bar or restaurant was bad. This usually means they are trying to get free stuff. Stick with Applebee's kids, go get a Coors Light in Old Town and wear something sleeveless, v neck or try to slip in with a pair of Jordan's then get mad about the dress code.  I love this place. I've been here a ton of times, and will keep coming back. I continue to bring people here because it is an amazing place.  The owner and gm know how to treat good customers. The staff is always friendly and don't leave you sitting for 20 minutes without, at least, dropping off waters and apologizing that they are slammed and make every effort to make you feel welcome. They also aren't half naked. If I wanted that, I'd go to the strip club. Please, please, please, just leave the classy places alone and enjoy the \"bro\" atmosphere.  Thank you so much."}
{"text":"Great cocktails and service! The ambiance of the place is very simple and chic. I want to come and sit at one of thebig booth tables for a party. There are at least 5 more cocktails I want to try out on the menu. I will be back for more with friends. Great job!"}
{"text":"This place!!! Holy crap. They were making stuff that I didn't even know existed. We were taken to this amazing bar with some friends that regular here and we were blown away! My list of drinks I tried were The Born Tequila, about 4 Porn Stars and some tequila concoction that the bartender made up. They were all top shelf and perfectly prepared. You need to go here. You will love it!"}
{"text":"Drinks are excellent and the service is perfect if you sit at the Bar, the bartenders have great skill however table service is slow and often rude. Prices are a bit high which I don't mind if its the entire package however the service needs so serious work.  *Cocaine Cowboy absolute Killer drink and the bartenders are consistent with the pours."}
{"text":"Amazing services!! Amazing food! I had the vesper for my drink, influenced by my favorite bond movie. And we ordered the grilled cheese bites (ahhhh mazing).. Also the pork belly and the chicks lettuce wraps!! I can't wait to go back!! It's definitely my new favorite bar downtown!!"}
{"text":"Sure it can be somewhat snobbish but until you've bartender for the masses, you just don't know what it's like to try to please someone who thinks a pina colada must be on every drink menu.   Ross and his crew rival the best bars anywhere, end of story. Treat them well and you'll have an amazing experience. Top notch cocktails and service here."}
{"text":"Great bartenders and excellent drinks.  Strong and delicious.  Enjoyed the menu layout and all the possibilities.  Good vibe.  The ability to take out a six pack of beer was a plus!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and wonderful drinks, B&T is a breath of fresh air to the downtown Phoenix night scene. So much down here has limited night/weekend hours, I was rather excited to hear about this place.   The first time I visited was about a week after they opened. I had a drink (classic caipirinha) and a bite to eat (the baked hangover - a delicious bowl of bready, saucy goodness topped with an egg that I was very sad to see had been taken off the menu when I returned). The music was a bit loud on my second trip in, but then again it was a Friday night so it maybe should have been expected.   It has a cool industrial feel that you can't really find anywhere else in the area. Overall, B&T is a great place to come for drinks and, if you're willing to splurge a little, some food too."}
{"text":"Amazing cocktails and an awesome ambiance! The selection is huge so take some time with you when you go so you can look through everything and get a really cool, unique drink! I Had the Hemingway's Demise and it was worth it!"}
{"text":"I saw the craft cocktails on Yelp and I thought I just gotta get to this place and have a try. We were welcomed and seated very quickly they have a waitlist on Yelp thanks for that. The cocktail menu is daunting it's insane...insanely awesome. Lots of choices and lots of diversity-----yes please what a nice change. We had three different cocktails and by the way ur gonna get tipsy. We had a few menu yummies the Korean Nachos do that if nothing else. We had ramen burger the meat was great the ramen buns had no flavor add some of that good ole college beef flavor into those bad babies. We had the street tacos but that potsticker shell it's too chewy the meat was mmm tasty though.  We had two different cupcakes which were the bomb would do that again every time. Summer the manager was a delight gave us the background on the place. Listened to our thoughts even gave us a card for the lady that crafted the tasty cakes. Nikki and Michelle were our service professionals they were lovely people that made the experience extra special. Don't forget Bill at the door he is really nice and dishes the downtown scoop. Check it out for yourself but bring a DD"}
{"text":"Do not go if you have a big group. They will Refuse you!! Who refuses business!?!? Sure maybe they did have a full house. But 9pm on a hot summer night. Not sure.... I am not sure I will go back or recommend this place. Citiscape is right across the street. So plenty more options. Grrr.."}
{"text":"Cool place. Friendly staff. Place is always packed. Drinks are good, food good. Only issue is that you can't really converse with anyone else besides who is with you at your table. More of a restaurant than a \"bar\". Hour wait on Friday night. Will come back."}
{"text":"Perhaps this one star review should be shared with the PR company hired by the owner of Bitter and Twisted, but in truth, Bitter and Twisted messed up by hiring them.  Big time! I received an invitation to their soft opening last and was super excited since I'm an alcohol snob! I immediately RSVP with my and my guest's name and got a confirmation e-mail back.  YAY! I arrived with my guest and saw a few people standing around outside and a girl with a clipboard.  I said, \"Oh, are we not in yet?\"  Thinking that the opening (6 to 8) was running a bit late. She informed me that the bar was full.  Then some guy walkied out of the bar and told her that it was \"one in, one out\"  No smile for the crowd, nothing.  No, \"thank you for coming, sorry for the wait.\"  NOTHING.  The girl with the clipboard was nice, checked to see if my name was on the list (it was), gave me two keys for free drinks when we got inside, and took my cell number to call me when we could get in so we could wander around Ctyscape or whatever it is across the street.  She did a decent job.  No apology though.  By the time 8 pm rolled around, we had said \"to Hell with it\", and ordered vodkas and burgers across the street at Gypsy.  But that's another review later.  Forget this place, just order your premium liquor at your favorite neighborhood bar and keep the economy in your neighborhood running while discouraging hipster douchebags from taking over the world."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Huge drink menu. They do have a top ten list on their drink menu- and they are there for a reason! We sampled quite a few from the list and they were all worth it. Delicious cocktails for the price. Food items are not your typical bar food. They are equally creative and flavorful.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Came with friends the other night. Had to wait a while to get a drink. When it came time to pay the server was no where to be founds. When we attempted to pay at the bar they sent us away stating we had to locate our server. We ended up asking a few other staff to locate her. Other than the bad service the atmosphere was good."}
{"text":"This place has an amazing atmosphere. Great place to bring out of towners or to try a unique and STRONG adult beverage."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed in my experience here. I had heard great things about the place. The food was mediocre and flavorless and the cocktails were not crafted well for being a specialty cocktail lounge. I hope my experience is better next time and that they were just having an off day."}
{"text":"This is a cool and fun place to try! Unfortunately, the drinks were not the highlight of the meal but they have such an extensive drink menu I'm sure I will find something I like. Their fried chicken and fish and chips were delectable!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour menu, everything is worth the few extra bucks although it really isn't that expensive. The drinks and bartenders are incredible. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Bitter & Twisted is not a \"hyped-up\" place. This IS THE PLACE TO GO TO. I've heard such good things about this place and I can now confirm that this is the spot to go to if you want a quality cocktail & a great atmposhpere. Came here after my friends engagement with a party of 6 (we got a spot through \"Nowait\") & the drinks didn't take long to come out.   I ordered the \"her name is rio\" & I can say this was so artistically made. The cachaça was strong enough but the overall mint and other flavors helped make it so you didn't taste it. Pleasant and delicious drinks, definitely coming back here again."}
{"text":"We had dinner reservations down the street and decided to stop by for a drink beforehand. My husband looked at me funny when I pointed to where it was at, the fogged windows up front make it blend in with the rest of the (empty? abandoned?) buildings on that side of the street.   BTW, it was an August evening in downtown Phoenix, it felt like a ghost town outside. We walked in and, to our surprise, the place was pretty busy with just a few large booths open and some seats at the bar (we apparently had found where everyone was at). We were greeted by the hostess immediately and made our way to the bar.   One of the bartenders greeted us promptly and gave us drink menus and waters. The drink menu is pretty expansive, as this place is known for specialty cocktails. We were so enchanted by the menu we missed the specials board (next time!). They do have a happy hour - mostly food discounts and a few drinks. The food looked great, we can't wait to try the Hurricane Popcorn (think that was the name?) on our second visit!  I ordered the Lime & The Coconut and my husband had a Manhattan. Our (full price) drinks were worth every penny! The bartender crafted them in front of us and he was definitely a master of his art. Afterwards, he conversed with us a bit and was very warm and welcoming (sometimes hipster places like this are lacking the friendliness that this place definitely had).  I am sure this will be our go-to spot for meeting friends from the other side of town and also where we take out of town guests who are yearning for something out of the ordinary - we are excited to go back!"}
{"text":"I'm horrified that I have to give a rating This will probably be on your board (thanks!) so next time someone asks for a tequila drink and you suggest a margarita please do me a favor and relocate yourself to a Carlos O'Brien's. Pathetic. And when your bartender that made that drink thinks it's perfection, slap him cause he needs a hard reality check. This place was once great and now they are the epitome of a hipster bar.  This post won't do shit but I feel better. Enjoy the over priced, privileged service and mediocre cocktails."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Such a great, interesting vibe with delicious drinks and a fun small bites menu. Seating can sometimes be an issue, so I wouldn't necessarily plan a trip around being here a while, just in case, but it's a great place to drop into before a show or game, after work, or on a chill weekend."}
{"text":"Great drink selection! For sure the best whiskey sour I've ever had. Great place to hang out at on a weekend or go on a date. Still have to come here on a week night for happy hour. Definitely a fun cool place to hang out at."}
{"text":"Bitter & twisted is by far my favorite cocktail parlor in Phoenix. Notice I said parlor; don't mistake this for some club or dive bar.   The sign to the bar is very small & on a odd corner entrance. When you arrive you may have to wait for a table, the wait times vary on which day you go.  When you walk in there are drapes at the entrance, gives it a mysterious vibe. That is where is host will seat you. I personally like sitting at the bar to watch the bartenders make cocktails.   The cocktail menu can be overwhelming but just tell the bartender what you like and/or don't like. They will make exactly what your taste buds like. I have never been disappointed on their creations.   I'll continue to go to Bitter & Twisted"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is so great with the exposed brick and concrete. And the cocktails, let me tell ya, are absolutely amazing. The bartenders are phenomenal and super friendly. All the staff was actually so hospitable which isn't always the case. YAY fun cocktails"}
{"text":"I'm glad that this is so far from my home or I'd be broke...  PS Miranda R. Go home you're drunk, I'm not family or friendly..."}
{"text":"The \"Momo\" burger changed my life. Crispy ramen noodles as the \"bun\" + sesame soy drenched patty + sriracha soba sauce + carmelized onions + pepper jack cheese + jalapeño mayo...and extra napkins. Now, I'm just waiting to die."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite bar! They make the best drinks EVER. If you are ready to experiment and try new drinks THIS IS THE PLACE TO EXPLORE. Their menu is extensive but they will answer any questions you have. Call ahead to check the wait and put your name down because it gets busy and there isn't a ton of seating. I like to go here for drinks before heading out for dinner. It's a nice place for date night; dim lighting, music, cozy. It can get expensive but I think the quality justifies the cost."}
{"text":"Huge menu of drinks!  So hard to choose. I went with the Slap and Tickle. How could I go wrong?! Helpful waitress patiently offered suggestions and answered questions. Quiet on a Tuesday night. Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"It's been over a year now and I've been quite a few times! The place is amazing! I've had almost everything on the menu, most more then once and I love it all.  The Ramen Burger is my favorite burger out of everywhere I've ever had a burger.  The Hurricane Popcorn is amazing and I always get that first to snack on with my first cocktail while I decide which entry or combination of small bites I'll be having.  I also have gone to one of the events and they are thoroughly thought out and very enjoyable!  There's special cocktails and decorations, along with a fully participating staff.  I've always received top notch service whether I've been sitting at the bar, a community table or a booth."}
{"text":"More than a bar. More than a cocktail bar. More than anything.   Aside from having an amazing cocktail menu, these bartenders know their stuff. Can't make a decision? Just state a few preferences and they'll get to work on a unique and interesting cocktail to suit your fancy.   Don't even get me started on the food. Big plus: open late and right in the heart of downtown.  Even the classic Manhattan I had blew me away."}
{"text":"Love this place!  They have the best Old Cuban (my favorite drink) and other craft cocktails. Good ambience. Great staff - they always have great recommendations for drinks.  Unique menu with delicious food."}
{"text":"Alcohol: Because no great story ever started with someone eating a salad.  Still buzzed from the Yelp Gets Spooked Party, we went over to Bitter & Twisted to continue with the festivities!  IDs were checked, we were seated, and more shenanigans were soon to be had.  No one even batted an eye when we strolled through in our crappy Party City costumes.  Three cops, two burglars, a kawaii witch, and a macho man all sat together for a great and fabulous meal.  Here's the break down of what three of us ordered since the other four shared their own stuff:  HURRICANE POPCORN - [$8 butter, garlic, sesame, nori, shichimi, spicy rice crackers]:  Technically ordered by Jannette L. but stolen by everybody, this popcorn was pretty damn fun.  It was spicy and savory and every now and then, you get one super-coated shichimi kernel that woke our tired asses up.  Loved it.  KOREAN NACHOS - [$12 bulgogi brisket, gochu cheese sauce, sesame crema, jalapeno, scallions]:  These were really ridiculously good.  The chip stayed crispy even with all that heavenly bulgogi and cheese sauce on it.    PORK BELLY BUNS - [$12.5 Thai basil glaze, hoisin bbq, cucumber and scallions, with bao buns]:  This.  This right here was the best damn thing I ate all evening.  You don't even need the extra hoisin BBQ sauce they give you on the side because the pork belly has been braised and coated in that sinfully delicious sauce.  The pork belly is literally melt-in-the-mouth good.  The cucumber gave it a nice texture.  I will definitely get this again.   The other half of our table also got a salad, the dumpling burger, and the ramen burger which looked and smelled amazing.  If I wasn't busy getting freaky with my pork belly baos, I might have tried to steal some of their burgers. No regrets at this place.  For cocktails, I got the Love Fruit Medley and nearly hijacked my friend's Lime & The Coconut.  They're an award winning cocktail parlor so it's obvious that our drinks were bomb.  We also got the gorgeous Bath Tub Punch.  I don't know what's in it but it was damn tasty and potent.  It kind of reminds me of a Long Island Iced Tea.  By the time we were finished with our food and drinks, we received some cards to go to their Halloween 80's-themed party.  If I didn't have work, I'd DEFINITELY be there tonight!  Happy Halloween, Bitter & Twisted!  The staff, from hostess to waitress, were all super friendly.  It's gorgeous inside and both the food and drinks are delightful. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped by after the Trump rally for a drink. The atmosphere was nice; dark dining area and bar. Modern music and a good selection of wine made this a good stop for an upper class type of establishment. If your looking for a beer and to relax at the bar your selection is limited to only a few bottled beers. No beer is on tap. There is wine on tap. Prices were on the higher side."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go to this place since it opened, but just haven't made my way there.  After dinner at Squid Ink, the BF and I walked over to get some drinks.  I was appalled that there was a \"line\" out front.  By \"line\", I mean two other couples standing waiting to get inside.  That's when we learned that they once they reach seating capacity, they don't let anyone else in.  No common area.  No bar area.  No common bar area.  So...you just have people standing on a street corner in downtown Phoenix waiting to get into your establishment?  Me thinks not.  I'm sorry, I thought I was going to an upscale cocktail parlour, not a 20-something Scottsdale club.  At least have somewhere inside where people can wait.  That's just tacky."}
{"text":"We just went in for cocktails and I adored the decor and music choices. Big high backed red leather booths, retro pin-up style mural all fantastic.  I had the lemongrass Collins and the whiskey berries jubilee. I loved that they were both flavorful without being sweet. Served in beautiful tall glasses with mint garnishes. My girlfriend got the brisket tacos and they were great.   I noticed they posted Yelp comments of the week on their board and loved that they had posted a quote from one of their negative reviewers. It felt so passive aggressively snarky... I don't have anything negative to say so I probably won't make their wall this week but they are our new go-to cocktail place to take visiting family and friends to."}
{"text":"The birthday girl was DETERMINED to have a drink here. So we got a table after a 30 min wait (reasonable for 16-they don't take reservations). Then one server came around to take drinks for a birthday group of 16.  True story. We were told if someone wasn't seated, they would be asked to leave. Needless to say, major buzz kill full of rules.  I was so excited...sad times."}
{"text":"Visited Bitter & Twisted for the first time recently, and I was really impressed. The mood of the place is very cool; a great, low-lit hang with endless spirit choices in a charming setting. The service was genuinely friendly and helpful.  The menu is not vast, but each dish is carefully crafted and bursting with flavor. I ordered the smoked brisket tacos from the \"Snacks\" section. These are smaller than street tacos but they give you 4. They have a sweet glaze and come with really tasty guacamole. My date opted for the \"Dragon\" Dumpling Burger, which was unique and pleasantly flavorful. It tastes like a burger made from Asian pork dumplings and is served on an English Muffin (which is always ok with me!).   We loved it so much we brought our friends with us later in the evening and received the same great service. They have a drink selection that'll make your head spin, but they've given you a page of the most popular drinks they serve if you need help narrowing it down. Overall a fantastic spot to hang out and enjoy your friends. The manager Zachary was extremely inviting as well; highly recommend."}
{"text":"Come for the cocktails, stay for the cupcakes! Great selection of spirits."}
{"text":"You can't stop me from LOVING this place!! Our son and his girlfriend invited us out for a night of frivolity and Bitter & Twisted it was. I love walking into a place that surprises me - great seating throughout - hightops, lowtops, banquettes, and booths. Our service was excellent - thanks so much! The cocktail menu is a booklet of fun to riffle through. We started with The Duck Bath Cocktail - Oh My Land - so nice and fluffy and share-able. Everyone had their own cocktail after that - choose something whimsical, or sturdy, or fruity, or just plain delish. Food here was also excellent. The Ramen Burger - wonderful; the Mothra Noodles - a joy; the Fish & Chips (Chish & Fips) - delicately fried and tasty; and the green chili mac - out of this world. Don't dilly-dally, come on down and check 'em out."}
{"text":"If I say this place sucks, will you feature me on the board? Also, I found the door, suckas."}
{"text":"One of the best bars I have found in Phoenix since I have been here, you definitely get what you pay for and that is quality!! The food is ridiculously good and the staff is nice and helpful. Would definitely recommend to anyone wanting a relaxing place to hang with friends while sipping on good drinks."}
{"text":"I've been to this place several times, but Friday night was one of the worst dining experiences I ever had. Our waitress, Nicki was rude and spent most of her time ignoring us. I watched her talk to her only other table through three songs while my girlfriend and I had empty glasses. They remedied the situation and the evening finished on a positive note. This place really does make the best cocktails in town, but whatever you do stay away from the nasty mess that is the Ramen Burger. The beef is low grade and flavorless and the ramen noodle bun might be the cheapest most gimmicky monstrosity ever. These guys should stick to the meat and cheese boards and cocktails and leave the cooking to someone with a clue."}
{"text":"I was staying in downtown Phoenix for a convention and decided to go out one night with my sorority sisters. We were looking for a bar and a chill scene and we found this place on Yelp!  It was in walking distance of the hotel we were staying at and one of the places that was open till 2AM on a Saturday. When we got there, it looked kind of sketchy with the glass windows tinted so that you can't see inside of it and a bouncer was at the front checking IDs. There was no line and no wait which was great! However I've never been to a bar where the bouncer looks on an iPad for seating inside the place.   You do have to be 21+ to enter, so take note of the that before! When we entered the location, there were curtains blocking the view of the place and a little opening where the hostess was standing. She looks at another iPad and seats you.  The decor reminds me of the 50's mixed with the Victorian ages. There is also loud music that is playing with some of today's music and some oldies, which gives it a club type feel (but there is no dancing room).   The one thing I loved about this place is that they have a booklet filled with different types of drinks depending on what you're looking for! I got a fruit filled drink with watermelon and the waitress was very knowledgeable about all the drinks.  I gave this place 4 stars because everything was great but the drinks (mine and what my sisters ordered) did not really taste any alcohol in them so it seemed like just juice for the price of an alcoholic drink. Also, we ordered a cheesy bread and I kid you not, it was the size of one piece of garlic bread cut into four pieces. The presentation was nice and I would come back but I wish I would get more bang for my buck."}
{"text":"We had been wanting to try this bar all year - since it opened but we never got to it!  Tonight we did and boy! are we glad we did.  First off the Luhrs Building is amazing and it makes me so happy to see this classic bit of deco Phoenix isnkept alive.  Anyway, the cocktail menu is extensive and very interesting.  The use of handmade syrups and cordials was delicious.  The use of special tinctures and herbal extracts adds to the craft element of the cocktails.  We sat at the bar and they made my husband a special drink of carbonated lime cordial and rum.  (Didn't get the name dang it).  I had the Hemingway Daquiri which was very refreshing with the grapefruit garnish, sugar and fresh lime syrupm with rum.  For the 2nd round I had an On The Town - rum, maple syrup, cinnamon cordial and overall deliciciousness.  Would be a perfect fall drink.  Hubby had the Jaffa Daquiri with a shrub garnish and a nice dry taste.  We will go back and try the food too!"}
{"text":"Ambience is great, this was my second time visiting. First time we sat at the bar and the service was solid. This last time we sat at a table and the service was appalling. The waitress with dark hair and over sized black glasses not only took her time getting our drink order, she had a snarky attitude. To make matters worse she incorrectly put in a drink order and when we decided not to reorder it she acted like we just took money out of her pocket. She then proceeded to blame my friend for her mistake on someone else's order right in front of all of us at the table. I don't know how someone like this is working in a costumer service job. She really needs to find another career path."}
{"text":"This Place is HORRIBLE. DO NOT GO HERE EVER!!!!!!  To start with we were quoted with a 15-30 min wait that turned into an hour wait.  All the while I watched an empty table with no one in it for 30 min before we ended up being seated in it.  There is no place to sit while you wait.  We were asked if we needed any drinks while we waited.  I asked for a glass of water and the waitress promptly walked away, never confirmed it and never got it for me. Once we were seated it still took a while for our order to get taken.  The portion sizes of food are too small and the drinks too light and filled with ice for their price.   DO NOT EAT DINNER HERE.  Also the door is incredibly hard to find.  The door to get in is covered in plain frosted glass so you cant see inside but has no markings or sign to indicate what it is."}
{"text":"Great great great, amazing, fire in my mouth drinks! Long long wait always but worth it.. we put our names on the list waked to cooper blues for a beer and boom ready for our table... Old fashion was inspiring   ! The whiskey float was delicious .. we also had the popcorn and devoured it.... yummy yummy"}
{"text":"Very inventive cocktails and food, fun atmosphere and great service. I'm sure to make another visit to Phoenix and Bitter and Twisted is one of the places I'll definitely return to."}
{"text":"Great place!  Very knowledgable staff and awesome drinks.  We had a party of 8 and everyone was thrilled with their cocktails!  It is a bit pricey, but well worth it.  Everything I tried was amazing, but my favorite for the night was the blackberry collins.  Will definitely be back to sample more of their amazing cocktails."}
{"text":"Our server was super nice and very knowledgeable. Would definitely  come here again. Happy hour is the best time to come here. The grilled cheese bread is delightful!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness.  I could not have found a more perfect place to celebrate my birthday.  My girlfriend and I was invited to join a buddy to have a drink before the Mercury game.... woo hoo... Since I had a rainbow unicorn party hat on .... a gentleman, that I later discovered was the general manager, brought me a \"rainbow unicorn\" beverage.  Not knowing exactly his title/position I told him thank you and that I would be taking the unique, colorful, menu which is a work of art.  He left and returned with t-shirts for gf and me, menus from different years, cozis to hold drinks,... all sorts of goodies to make the night memorial. Oh.  not to mention.... the drinks and food are spectacular.  Would love to go there every night but Dan is not there on Sundays or Mondays... planning to return soon with different groups of people. Check it out - Most unique establishment.... seems like it is from Amsterdam or another progressive establishment  not from Az ...  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I finally know the truth. I was sent a letter by Hogwarts, it just went to my neighbors. The mistake has been rectified and I have been admitted into the wizarding world. How'd I find out? Well, my induction ceremony was my trip to Bitter & Twisted - which is basically what a bar would be like in Harry Potter - specifically a Potions class.  There is a real elongated feel here. Like the room has been permanently stretched after being put in front of a fun mirror at the circus. The chairs are long. The ceiling is high. Basically it's Hogwarts from the movies, but with a drop of elegance from the Victorian Era - truly the perfect combo.  Once the layout takes your breathe away, the drinks will stupefy you. So many options and each is as mesmerizing as a double rainbow.  I got a red one that seemed to fizz, but tasted like orange soda with vodka. Like I said it's basically Potions class from Harry Potter.   I didn't get food because I just didn't see the point. I was too focused on trying to figure out what new drink I wanted to taste, and getting one of the tables that had Mario available to play while you sipped on your beverage.  I give Bitter & Twisted my official stamp of approval. The stamp isn't licensed or approved by any legislative or governing body, but dag nab it, you're going to a restaurant created by magic, who needs that muggle stuff!"}
{"text":"Bitter and Twisted is probably the best bar I've been to in Arizona since moving here! The drinks are really good and their weekly cupcake seems super interesting. The real show stealer is honestly the menu. They have the most beautifully printed menu I've ever seen! Every page is a super intracate fantasy themed print. My only complaint is that the menu is sometimes hard to read because of the intracate print and the chosen font color, but I'm not even mad about that."}
{"text":"For the folks that don't consider this a cocktail parlor,  I really would like to know what you think one is...   I enjoy coming here.   The offering of Vodka is nice.   (some)  People think all vodkas are created equal....  Uhm,  no.   They aren't.   I have enjoyed sampling the potatoe vodkas and other things on the drink menu.   A friend of mine is hooked and he always suggests BT when we want to meet up for drinks.   This place is aesthetically pleasing.   I have to take off a star because I am not impressed with the food choices.   I really enjoyed the ramen burger,  but that's it as far as food is concerned.   I have tried several other things that I didn't like.   I didn't like the smashed chips at all.   :-(  something odd about the spices used on them.   I had an outing with about 10 ladies,  when BT was suggested by someone in the group,  I suggested we stay away because the food offering is really for folks with wide palates and smaller tummies.   I haven't had a problem getting in to this place,  except when I stopped by last Monday.   I was pissed!   How dare they lock the doors on the day they are closed.   ;-)   I love the Yelped board,  I do hope I do not make it though.  If I do,  please let me know so I can come in for a drink and document the occasion."}
{"text":"B&T is the best looking bar in the Phoenix metro area.  Thanks to the 4 star review, we walked across from City Center to this 5 week old establishment.  I can't think of another bar that offers an open, 2 story space with floor to ceiling exposed brick behind the bar and huge grey cement columns that keep the nearly century old building in place.  It's truly worth stopping by for a drink just to enjoy the space for a few moments.  Plus everyone that works there is ultra friendly and polite.  B&T lacks any pretentiousness, which is extremely rare in craft bar settings.   I had 2 (1 was not enough) Tickle My Dickels, which were light and refreshing whiskey based concoctions.  The Mojito my wife had was equally excellent.   But the Tiramisu......that Tiramisu drink was otherworldly.  It's mixed with all kinds of stuff that I couldn't keep track of, but it tasted like great tasting Tiramisu and that's all that matters!  We also snacked on the smashed chips, which are thickly sliced potato chips with crispy outsides and moist insides and topped with avocado and other tasty southwestern style stuff.  The menu looks excellent in its utter lack of needing to be mainstream.  A burger with a Top Ramen bun?  That sounds amazing and is on my list of things to try there.     *Tip 1*  Happy hour runs from 4-7 on Saturdays, for cheap guys like me  **Tip 2**  Make this place a stop on your Downtown Phoenix pub crawl.  I will definitely be adding it to our usual Christmas crawl"}
{"text":"I give the company 10 stars....but...The service was probably a three star. Place was hopping and the cocktail menu was huge.  I don't go downtown often but I might try it again."}
{"text":"AS far a cocktails go - this is the best I have had in PHX and is serviced by legit, professional bartenders. I am never disappointed here. Everyone I bring falls in love and is enchanted by the selections, the ambiance and the performance that is putting together a craft cocktail with skill and flare! Bring your friend who is not impressed by anything to this place - they will be impressed and if they're not, dump 'em! I haven't had any food here, but the food is being recognized here, there and everywhere. It is very unassuming from the outside, but when you walk in, it is old school upscale bar charm with a romantic glow all around. Sit at the bar!"}
{"text":"The Ramen burger was fun to try but nothing that I have to have again. Their cocktails are good and the atmosphere is classy. It's a bit pricey and parking isn't ideal. It's a nice place if you're in the area though."}
