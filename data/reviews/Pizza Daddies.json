{"text":"This is for sure our favorite pizza place around!  They have a great list of beers available at all times, which change often I believe.  We get their stuffed deep dish pizza, with sausage, pepperoni & banana peppers.  It is to die for!  They just recently remodeled a bit and there is more seating both at tables and at the bar.  Everyone has been very friendly when we've been there.  We've eaten in twice, but usually we just order for pickup.  Definitely a place to check out!"}
{"text":"I miss the old pizza daddies.  The pizza just isn't what it used to be; the new owners definitely decided to use a different recipe. It's still a nice place to go for a good beer, but the pizza had been disappointing.

Update: although I miss the Pizza Daddies pizza, I love many food items on Barrel Junction's menu: the macaroni and cheese, nachos, and the pulled pork sandwich, and wings are all delicious!"}
{"text":"Great food, wonderful ppl! Go c Rocky at the bar!  Cozy restaurant area and bar.  awesome place to watch the game or just hang out and eat. Everyone is so friendly!"}
{"text":"This is the reason I support small pizza shops.  Now, of course I enjoy the occasional Papa John's slice, but I really do try to spend money that will stay in the community, and Pizza Daddies is my favorite around.

They are always friendly over the phone, which goes a long way from other pie shops where they seem hurried to get you off and get the next order taken.  Also, when quoting you a time, they tend to be accurate, which I can appreciate.

The pizzas and such are always a good size for what you are paying, and the ingredients are fresh.  (I know this, as I used to watch them be delivered as I ate breakfast in the small restaurant that used to be in the next space down.)"}
{"text":"Fabulous pizza and rootbeer.  We were on our way home from DC and needed a place to eat.  This restaurant was a pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"New owner means new changes. Food selection is smaller but ok. Pizzas are not as great. Still have a decent beer selection on drafts but bottles are more domestic now. Bartenders are average at best."}
{"text":"I haven't tried their food because every time I go, I enjoy the selection of craft beers both on tap and in bottles more.  On several occasions, I have gone in and talked to the owner, who was very friendly.  My wife isn't a \"bar\" type of person but she asked to go there for her birthday and had fun.  Great local bar that I am looking forward to trying the food in future experiences."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the area and the beer selections make my husband smile"}
{"text":"Wow this little gem was such a good find. I can't believe a place like this exists in Gibsonia. I guess it opened up 2 years ago. My parents live down the road and it seems like all of the good places have opened since i moved away! 
My brother told me they had a good beer selection and boy do they!! I felt like I was back in Cali with how many san diego beers and craft beers they had on tap. They also had some more hard to find beers from all over the country! Our bar tender (Jess i believe her name was) was very nice and let us try a bunch before we settled on some beers. She always came by to check on us and refill our beers! Top notch service.  My one friend who is a big scotch drinker got some and said their selection of scotch was great and he said it was some of the best prices he has seen!
We got some apps that were tasty and the prices were very good!
What a small little gem! Love it!!! Will be my new go to spot when i visit home!"}
{"text":"I went to this place from a recommendation. However after receiving my tab mind you this is happy hour. I was floored. Great pizza but i think they could do a better job on beer pricing"}
