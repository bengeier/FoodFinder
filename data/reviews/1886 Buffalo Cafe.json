{"text":"First time to Calgary and not sure where to eat. Asked the front desk and they gave us two or three suggestions. We decided to try this one and i sure did not regret it. Don't let the run down building fool you. This was one of the best breakfasts I've had in a long time. Coffee was good and the toast is great along with  the sausage and eggs. Also had a fruit cup and it was yummy and the fruit ripe... even the blackberries."}
{"text":"Service was alright but was really disappointed with the food.  We ordered a huevos ranchero and the eggs Benedict.  Both were just alright but from what we've heard about this place I was expecting the caliber of the food a little higher. Found it strange that the eggs benedict had fried eggs instead of poached eggs and that it was served on regular toast.  Oh well tried it."}
{"text":"Cute little place with lots of squandered potential. Ordered Ed's Benedict which is just eggs with shredded cheddar cheese and tomatoes. Food was on par with what I would whip up at home, nothing special. Server was quite rude and unfriendly. Potatoes were way too salty, some overcooked and some way undercooked. Toast was soggy (how?!) and eggs were well...they were eggs. Much too expensive for what we got."}
{"text":"Nice breakfast menu, good food, but rather on the pricier side for what you get, I think. Staff was friendly.
Really cool thing about the place is the ambiance. The furniture and style is really cool and kind of takes you back to a calgary of some past time.
It is worth a visit."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. It is a lovely, locally-owned little breakfast spot, but not terribly inspired.

The food was decent enough, though a bit over-priced. The service was friendly and they keep your coffee cup full.

Seems like a cute, trendy little place to go with friends for brunch."}
{"text":"If you are seeking a good home-cooked breakfast, without having to sweat for it, consider paying 1886 cafe a visit.

The staff were friendly and efficient. 
Overall, the food was solid but I do have to mention that the coffee and the drinks were average -for the price ( around $3.50 ). I did see some customers bringing in their own cup of coffee (I know it is bad etiquette , but good coffee is a must for an excellent breakfast!). 
  The fruit drinks were a bit watered down for me - definitely not freshly squeezed (sorry , am I being a little too picky now?). 

 My verdict?  It is a great place to meet up with your friends after a delightful jog down the Bow River path ! You won't leave disappointed."}
{"text":"Food is very good.  Service how ever is lacking. Waited over five minutes for hostess to come by and greet us.  Another few minutes for them to clean off a table and seat us.  Once seated we were rushed to order.  They weren't THAT busy.  Cute place, good food, service by an Asian women who didn't know how to smile or interact with customers."}
{"text":"There is a really unique feeling you get when eating a good breakfast while sitting in a log cabin. This is a small place, so I don't suggest going in a big group, but it has great food, good prices, and a really unique atmosphere. Super Canadian :)"}
{"text":"Embarrassingly bad. Ed's Benedict consisted of 2 slices of cheap bread, a couple of  poached eggs, and some tasteless melted cheese on sliced tomato. We went away overheated, disappointed, stunned. I remember good hearty breakfasts here, years ago."}
{"text":"The 1886 Cafe has apparently been serving Calgarians for nearly 120 years.  I love the old historical building. You will either love it too, or hate it, as it may not fit into your modern sensibilities of yuppie living as portrayed in Sex and the City...

This is a breakfast joint. It opens early in the morning and closes early in the afternoon. It's great for quick, early morning business meetings, finalising deals, or resolving disputes. Don't take any lawyers to this joint though, as they would consider this too unsophisticated for their expensive tastes, and too cheap to claim as an expense, to charge back to their suckers, called Clients.

The menu is limited to breakfast fare. It's authentic, home cooked, fresh and good. Just the way, my mother used to prepare breakfast for me as a kid. The choices are essentially eggs, potatoes, cheese,  and various combinations of that, with peppers, mushrooms and other vegetables.....with lots more cheese, and potatoes. They get the potatoes right all the time. And they give you LOTS of potatoes. The meals are filling and I always go for the ED's Benedict which is nothing remotely close to the authentic thing! But I go back for more, all the time. It's that good. 

Try it. I've never had a problem finding a table, and I've never had to wait. Although, watch those Saturday mornings, when you are sharing tables, a breath away from screaming babies and new young mothers, obviously trying to continue the 1886 traditions of wholesome breakfasts in the morning with their new litter."}
{"text":"Pretty good bang for your buck...and u don't have to wonder when breakfast ends...because it doesn't!  I had the breakfast burritos and they tasted fresh and delicious and even somewhat healthy (no cheese I think).  They would get 5 stars if they shook up the menu a little more often cuz it only takes a few trips before u have it conquered."}
{"text":"The key to the 1886 Buffalo Cafe is its history. The food was the classic greasy spoon and the service was extremely slow. As the tour books build up this restaurant as a MUST SEE, I wished it met (or even got close) to my expectations. It didn't.

Don't miss the great pieces of history on your walk to the bathroom."}
{"text":"Great location and food! The decor is very unique. I would recommend for a breakfast date!"}
{"text":"I love going for breakfast at the Buffalo Cafe!  I usually order either the breakfast burrito or the eggs benedict.  While the food is really great, my favourite thing about going there is the atmosphere.  The restaurant is in an old log cabin, smack dab in the middle of Eau Claire,  and has really cool antiquey decor and a laid back feel.  Some people might find the huge stuffed buffalo head on the wall a bit weird, but I love the ecclectic look of the place.  It's very relaxing and if you sit by a window on a sunny weekend afternoon you can do a lot of good people watching."}
{"text":"I can't believe how terrific this place is!
The food is perfect! Always cooked to perfection. The eggs are fluffy, hot - great work.
I go 1-2/week for lunch. What a gem!"}
{"text":"After reading some of the reviews of this restaurant online, I thought I would give it a try.  

My impression is that the food is overpriced and the restaurant is over-hyped.  The food didn't taste bad but I have had better for the price."}
{"text":"This breakfast joint has  been around since I can remember; our waitress proudly stated she has just celebrated 26 years at
The café!  I don't know how she does it, staying upbeat, energetic and Uber-friendly everyday; but I am glad I am sipping on some of the same coffee that she serves and drinks too!

The food is amazing from eggs, omelettes and pancakes to oat meal, yogurt or just plain fruit.  The cozy ambiance is woodsy with a lot of history and Character; definitively a must-stop when in the Eau-Claire area."}
{"text":"1886 café was establish when I was born here in Calgary. To historical design which barely everyone notice the café will still operating for business in Eau Claire. For breakfast food was okay is kind of old western style breakfast chili's to steak and eggs and omelets. I ordered the Blaisey Boy Omelets which it was okay, if they can put less acidic taste preservatives ingredients into the omelets it will be great. But I will give the credit to the omelets base was perfectly made."}
{"text":"wanted to really really love it and just ended up thinking it was very good.  I think the potatoes are over-seasoned or something because wow the sodium content seemed very high. . . .

Anyway, the potatoes are real, which makes it one of the best breakfasts in Canada (LOL) the eggs were cooked correctly, the toast was wonderful and I enjoyed the theatre of watching some ridiculous American complain about the way the bill was put together.  He was indeed incorrect, but blustered enough to be a total spectacle.  Dinner and a show!

Anyway, there is a bit of a guarantee that there will be tourists there, but no guarantee of a show.

Maybe a bit pricey, but it was well above average."}
{"text":"Country feel in the big city. Great breakfast and free coffee that kept getting refilled. What more could I want on a lazy Saturday morning?"}
{"text":"Breakfast was plentiful in this 100 year old former lumber company nestled in the heart of downtown Calgary. A classic twist on the Eggs Benedict they have the Ed's Benedict which is 2 eggs over wheat toast topped with roasted tomatoes and Gouda cheese melted served with a heaping stack of roasted potatoes. It was certainly a big breakfast. Although how I do wish there was a meat on this.....
All in all, great quaint spot....."}
{"text":"I was in a bit of a time crunch earlier this week and I had to leave home without the most important meal of the day. 

My stomach happened to be growling as I passed the Buffalo Cafe. It smelt pretty darn good and let's face it, I was STARVING, so I popped in. 

I ordered the veggie omelette to go and was very happy with it. This is coming from someone who is EXTREMELY picky when it comes to the way my eggs are cooked, so if i say their eggs were good, they were damn good. 

I chatted up one of the servers and she did warn me that they get VERY busy on the weekends. It's pretty normal to have to wait in line for a bit before getting in, so do keep that in mind. 

Overall, the ingredients were fresh, the dish was tasty and the people were friendly. 

It was a great start to the day."}
{"text":"Do not go here! Horrible service and way too expensive. We were seated right away  but ended up leaving after waiting for our server to finish cleaning tables and helping everyone at the till. We ended up at The Loop on 33rd Ave. We were seated right away, orders taken and coffee on the table within minutes."}
{"text":"What a great place! Quiet! You can actually Caryonah conversation even when it's very busy. The breakfast menu is outstanding and the food comes as you asked for it. The waitstaff is superb. The coffee keeps coming. Definitely a place to have breakfast! We will return on our next visit to Calgary"}
{"text":"I love the 'Kenny's Special' scrambled eggs. This place is as authentic home-cooked breakfast as it gets. Quality."}
{"text":"Stopped by today at 10 AM because I hadn't been there in a couple of years.  The group I usually went with are either retired or laid off, but I had the day off so went to have breaky and coffee.  Walked in and there was only 1 table taken, but got a weird vibe from the waitress, like she was really busy.  Anyways, whatever, went and took a table in the side room and ordered the Eggs with toast and hashbrowns and added bacon.  Still the same quantity and quality as always, that has not changed. But the hashbrowns, which were unbelievably good before, was a little off today.  Dryer than before and not as tasty.  Then there's the $4.25 coffee - which is nothing special, but the price is definitely up there.  Think what was throwing me off was that the buzz and vibe is totally different from two years ago.  It's definitely quieter than before when oil was over $100 and deals were made over breakfast.  Not sure I'll be back, there are so many more breakfast cafes in Calgary now to experience."}
{"text":"Great little cafe to have breakfast or brunch! It's in a neat historical building in Eau Claire market. Right down town great location!!"}
{"text":"Cute but different menu. I like Diet Coke in the morning but they have no soda/poo. Also no cheddar cheese for an omelet, only Gouda.  However, the omelet was light and fluffy and very good. The hash browns are actually country style red potatoes, a little too much salt or seasoning."}
{"text":"Regrettably, I was not able to experience the 1886 Buffalo Cafe because they decided to close during operating hours at 12:55PM. I would understand if they had a legitimate reason like a power outage. The cited reason they decided to close? \"I had no customers since 11:30.\" Really?

One would expect that they would be happy to finally see a customer, but closing somehow seemed more important to them. There were 2 other people trying to get some food, but they just kicked us out. They didn't offer to have a coffee or whatever they had available.

This is the second time I am trying to check out this place and this is the second time it was closed. The first time the placed closed at 2PM but misleadingly left the \"we're open\" sign outside because (according to the staff member) they forgot to remove it. I hope that this review will be understood as a learning opportunity to improve standards of service."}
{"text":"Our work team had Breakfast for Lunch here at the 1886 Buffalo Cafe. It was a Friday afternoon (after the Lunch Hour) in Downtown in Calgary and this place was the only Eau Claire area place that we could have Lunch without a wait. Weren't these people supposed to be at work or like us did a hard-earned meal just come late after a hard morning's work?  The scene also reminded me of early career days when our Office would head out on Friday for a long lunch (including adult beverages) and then come back to work around 3 PM (or so) and just long enough to pack up our things and go home. 

This Cafe is named for the year American entrepreneur Isaac Kerr of Eau Claire, Wisconsin, founded his lumber mill on the banks of the Bow River in Calgary. This place was also made moderately famous by a Visa ad made for the 1988 Calgary Winter Olympics. It's a cool historical building, authentic inside and out, including the clapboard construction on the outside and rustic wood decor and wall history on the inside. A few days later as I walked by, I peaked inside and discovered that there's also a basement. Another interesting realization is that the cafe was here first, while the City built up around it. 

I had a delicious Blaisey Boy Sandwich which was more than one person could eat, but I did anyway. Table service was quick, but the speed from the Kitchen was a bit slower. I had a direct view into that one-man operation, enjoyed watching him meticulously prepare the individual dishes and didn't mind the wait at all."}
{"text":"Good breakfast place, antique 18th Century Cabin full of same era memorabilia .
- Staff: pleasant and hard working.
- food: ample portions tasty on a menu full of great selections. I tried the Eggs Benedict, not your standard fare but really good.
I visited on Sunday morning and the place was packed but was less than 4 minutes before I was seated and offered a coffee which was very smooth."}
{"text":"I probably shouldn't advertise that this is such an awesome place - it might get busier on the weekends! But, I just have to share!

This is an old shack (it's got great character!) of a building that used to be part of the Eau Claire and Bow River Lumber Company. This I know because when you go to use the washrooms - which are downstairs, there's a semi-museum set up with old pictures of what the Eau Claire area used to look like (in like hmm, let me see...1886...)

The menu is strictly breakfast, but they do have a mean veggie chili omelette. My favourite is the very cheesy Ed's Benedict. I also like the bottomless coffee and attentive servers.

Located right beside the Eau Claire Market and close to the Bow river, so you can go for a walk after breakfast in/on Prince's Island Park."}
{"text":"Had the Blaisey Boy omelette -- excellent hearty, spicy omelette, with just the right amount of heat. Great breakfast, and wonderful atmosphere."}
{"text":"We ended up at 1886 Buffalo Cafe on Victoria Day by accident. A couple friends were visiting from out of town and we wanted to do a non-franchise restaurant brunch so they could experience something unique to Calgary. Our top choices were either closed or too busy because of the holiday, so I ended up driving to odd places I knew including The Bow River Barley Mill in Eau Claire where I've had a couple memorable and solid brunches. Unfortunately they too were closed, but we noticed that 1886 Buffalo Café next door was indeed open and didn't look overly busy. Their sign read \"Restaurant Coffee Bar\" and a quick online search confirmed they specialize in \"Authentic Homestyle Breakfast\" with an average 80% review rate. Sounded good to us!

Much like The Barley Mill where we intended to visit, 1886 Buffalo Café resides in a historic Calgarian Building. At over 100 years old and former home to the Bow River Lumber Company there is a ton of history here. It's cool that they've kept the history in tact with the décor and fixtures, and added a lot of other historical items including pictures and information. You can even find some interesting information on the menu about the company's founder Peter A. Prince. The appeal of this place is really the character it offers as it still stands strong amongst the modern day buildings near by. 

The appeal of this historic gem really didn't extend into our food or service unfortunately. Unless people were rude in the 1800s and the food was average/overpriced, then they definitely got it on spot on and I failed to see the historical accuracy of it! I know that's not the case though... To explain further, our server was not accommodating whatsoever: no refills, no checkups, no how are you, no anything! She wasn't friendly at all and coasted through the whole experience beyond the absolute minimum of taking our orders, bringing it out and billing us.

As for the food it did have a bit of a \"homestyle\" feel to it, but overall it was pretty plain and nothing that made my taste buds jump for joy. I had the \"Eggs any Style\" with a side of Bacon; the eggs and toast were plain as could be and completely average. The hashbrowns were better and made with real whole potatoes, not too heavy and seasoned light. The bacon was good and crispy but definitely not worth the add-on price. This brings me to my next point, pricing... 1886 Buffalo Cafe is priced through the roof for what they offer, I can live with the $9.95 for 2 eggs + toast + hashbrowns but this was cheapest item on the menu! Most of their items are in the $15-18 range and don't offer much more. My side of bacon... an extra $5.25!! Their basic coffee $4.25!!! These prices are insane, might as well go to an all-you-can-eat brunch buffet at the prices they charge... The portions are small and completely average. You'd get the equivalent of what we got here at about 40-60% less cost at most restaurants. If you look at the kitchen though you do have to cut the Chef some slack for pulling it off in the small work space.

Beyond the character and history behind this place it was a pretty disappointing visit, it could be a charming and cozy place if they step up their service and either lower their prices or increase their portions. Until I hear of some sort of a change I won't come back."}
{"text":"I almost walked out when I realized my juice and coffee were each 4.25$!!!! I asked what kind of coffee it was and the waitress said \"just a colombian blend\" and I asked why it was 4.25$ and the waitress rolled her eyes and said \"ugh, I know.... I recommend getting lots and lots of refills\". EVEN THE STAFF are rolling their eyes at the expensive menu.

Steak and eggs is 22$
Omelette starts at 11.75$ and goes up 1.75$ per tiny bit of ingredients you put into it. LOL! Imagine getting an omelette with 4 ingredients and paying almost 20$. 

And it's not like the food or ingredients are any better for the price... The coffee is awful. The juice is just President's Choice concentrate orange juice.

My boyfriend's theory is that their rent must be very high.

Oh well."}
{"text":"Gutes Frühstück in netter Atmosphäre. Recht klein, also vielleicht ein wenig Wartezeit einplanen."}
{"text":"One of the oldest Cafes I have seen in Calgary, this place has a history and character from the old days of lumber mills to the modern brunch cafes.
We have tried it a few times for brunch and have never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is super cute, I love coming here occasionally when I'm in the mood for a hearty breakfast. Everything on the menu is hearty, there are not a ton of breakfast options like French toast, or pancakes. More like steak and eggs, and massive huge omlets. Although the food is delicious it is also very expensive, at the end \"eggs any style with bacon\" and hashbrown scrambler with sausage, one coffee and one juice the bill was $45. And the service is so-so. 

But unlike many many breakfast spots, I've never had to wait in a line here to get in."}
{"text":"1886 is among a string of house-turned-restaurant spots that I've been visiting recently. Hidden a bit behind the Barley Mill, it's a cute little spot to hit up for some breaky-and it's open at 6 am for you early birds.

The menus are laminated paper, and I don't think they've changed in awhile, they look well-loved. The restaurant itself is no bigger than two rooms. One main room and a smaller side-room. The walls are full of eye-candy like buffalo heads, old paper money, antique clocks and the likes. 

The food is definite diner breakfast food, though the atmosphere is not. Huevos rancheros, breakfast burrito, Ed's Benedict, even a full page on the reverse dedicated to customizing your omelette. Yep, they know their breakfast.

Our meals were huge (I opted for Ed's Benedict as I had read it in previous reviews and the name made me giggle), the coffee kept on coming. It was deliciously wholesome food the way my dad would've made it. And most dishes were in the $10-$15 range.

Lastly, I couldn't help but grab me a sucker from the old-time scale on my way out."}
{"text":"Breakfast burritos were quite good and the coffee was smooth. Service was decent, matching the casual ambience. Nice historical touch with the lumber mill motif."}
{"text":"If you come to Calgary, this place is simply a must. Hands down the best breakfast I have ever had. Also, super friendly staff and very cool history of the building. Check out the downstairs for the mini \"museum.\" Will be back here again!"}
{"text":"I'll keep this one short and sweet. The food is good - homestyle, good portions. The ambience is awesome. The location rocks. The service is a little on the slow side, but they keep you topped up on coffee.

Definitely a place to be for brunch in Calgary if you're not rushing and want to enjoy a hearty meal."}
{"text":"Melted gooey cheese available on everything.

That's probably all I need to write for a review, but just in case, here's some more:

1886 is tucked in behind the Barley at Eau Claire, in a heritage house (that one would assume was built in 1886). It's small inside, and whoever decorated really seems to love clocks...and buffalo heads. While it gets busy on the weekends, it's usually a quick wait - and no longer than any other diner on a weekend.

The food at 1886 is really good, but a little higher in price compared to Galaxy or Nellies. I would say the potatoes are worth it (especially smothered in cheese) and the location is great if you are near Eau Claire. Items are exactly what you'd expect from a breakfast place in a cute building - eggs, meat, chili, breakfast sandwich and burrito... 

The staff has been the same as long as I can remember. They are busy and know what they are doing. Friendly and efficient, you can't beat it. 

I am a fan. If you need more details on the melted cheese - it's gooey, stringy  and homemade. It's more melted-cheese than cheese sauce."}
{"text":"I'm a bit mixed here.  The breakfasts here are actually inspired in a lot of ways, but the proportions weren't too much to shout about, and the pricing is waaay higher than any other breakfast place.  But the environment is also facinating as it's celebrates over 120 years of frontier history (in their basement where the bathrooms are, there are some incredible photos and stories on their walls) despite being incredibly tiny and cramped.  Hell, when I saw the kitchen, I  just couldn't help but applaud that the chef managed to get so many breakfasts out from a place not much bigger than a large closet without screaming and pulling his hair out of a claustrophobic panic attack.

So back to the place.  First and foremost... if you really like your comfort, I would recommend going here at any other time of year but winter.  It's an old building that ain't all that well insulated.  On a cold day, you'll reaaaaally freeze.

Next, as I said, the food options are quite inspired.  Much more creative than the norm, such as their own version of Benny's.  But the pricing, I find it just so over the top.

So... where does that leave this review?  A nice place to go for the atmosphere, and the food is above average, but still enough little nagging things.  So a 3 is about the best I can say for now."}
{"text":"Was staying nearby at the Westin during a recent visit and ended up having brunch here on the concierge's recommendation. 

All in all, not a great experience. The food was very good but I found the service terrible; granted it was a weekend and they were busy, but still. Maybe I'm just cranky in the morning, but it sort of ruined the experience for me."}
{"text":"A great breakfast spot in downtown Calgary.  It is looked in a very cool old building, however it is a small space so you can sometimes run into long waits and spotty service.

While the menu is somewhat limited, they do cook a good breakfast.  I really enjoy the eggs and hash browns.  Anyone looking for a good eat should check it out."}
{"text":"After hearing that Michael Bublé ate here after performing in Calgary, I made a bookmark to try the place.  Two days ago, we happened to be in the area, so we stopped in for lunch.

When I think all-day breakfast, I think Denny's, which means I also think inexpensive.  That's the first think I noticed about 1886 -- it was expensive.  I ordered an omlet, which was $10 just for the eggs.  Each item added was $1.50 each.  Not just meat or cheese, but also any veggies.  So, an omlet (3 or 4 eggs, I would guess) with cheese, salsa, and tomatoes was pushing $15.  If I had my way, I would also have green onions, but I couldn't justify the cost for that.

Two times I chewed on egg shell, which as you can imagine I truly enjoyed.  In their defence, the eggs were very fluffy and would have been great if not for the shell.

Parking is either on the street, in a lot, or in the Eau Claire underground parkade.  No matter what, you're paying, but there's a cool deal at Eau Claire where you only pay $6 for 3 hours if you get there between 11:30 and 1:30 (I'm not totally sure about the start time).  That all assumes you can find a parking spot, of course.

The atmosphere was \"rustic\" and there's no air conditioning.  The service was decent enough, but obviously not striving for any medals.

I probably wouldn't come back here."}
{"text":"It's an ok breakfast place, I guess...  Not my favorite.  I had the ed's Benedict, if you LOVE melted cheese you'll like this one.  Quite expensive menu, extra bacon is 5$ for example.  Only filtered coffee.  The table next to me had veggie chili, it looked good."}
{"text":"Great place for all-day breakfast items!  I opted for Ed's Benedict - fried eggs on top of whole wheat toast with hollandaise sauce and grilled tomatoes on the top.  Substituted the hash browns with fruit for $3.50 extra.  My breakfast dish was pretty good and I enjoyed it!  The bowl of fruit was extremely fresh and delicious.  Coffee kept coming.

My friend had the 2 eggs with wheat toast, bacon and hash browns.  I had a taste of her hash browns and it was chunky and good.  She always orders her favourite breakfast dish at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Woke up and was hungry for some good ole western cowboy chow for breakfast. Problem was,  I was staying near Chinatown without a car so sadly it was looking like nothing but Chow Mein was in the cards for me.  But google maps to the rescue and before I knew it,  just a block from me was a tiny little1886 building that serves delicious cowboy fare and has certainly hosted its fair share of cowboys over time. 

1886 Buffalo Cafe,  see pics,  is an historic outpost in the middle of modern Calgary. Surrounded by modern office buildings,  malls,  hotels,  Chinatown, etc.  It's small,  cozy retains the original tin ceilings, clapboard construction and other original features of the day.  A pair of large nameless buffalo heads over the main entrance and in the main dining area both greet and ominously watch diners chomping on their food.

The omelet was fresh,  hot and tasty.  The Canadians like to put mayonnaise on everything and the omelet was not spared, but surprisingly didn't interfere with the taste.  Maybe they are into something with this whole mayonnaise thing!   The heaping portion of roasted potatoes excellent.  Service,  fast and professional.  

Didn't see any shoot out bullet holes in the walls or ceiling but wouldn't surprise me if I did."}
{"text":"Had breakfast, the huevos rancheros. A busy breakfast restaurant, only two staff on, they were a little overwhelmed, and service was a bit slow, with quite a few tables being left before they were cleared, a good, not great breakfast."}
{"text":"Pricey yet the food wasnt great! The only reason why we went was coz it looked so anicent and dilapidated we thought we should support old small business.... Sigh!!"}
