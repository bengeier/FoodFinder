{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVICE. Five of us ordered the lunch box during lunch. waited for 50 minutes before part of the food (plain rice and salad) arrived at our table. We had to take everything to-go. The server never bothered to drop by andy to apologize for the bad service. DO NOT TRUST all the positive review here for Hokkaido. Avoid at all cost!! For the same price, you can get way better food and service else where!"}
{"text":"We just wanted to share, this restaurant has some amazing rolls. Fantastic price point, and impeccable service. My husband and our kids have been there 5 times in the last month and a half. And we have say quality of service and food have been exceptionally consistent. What a difference, since we've learned this place was under new management. As we were quite surprised to read the reviews given. 

We would highly recommend the king roll, and make sure you ask for their roll recommendations. As they have a very long listed selection and tasty menu of items - Good to try everything out. And if your like my husband, who likes to treat himself some ultra premium sake, try out their Ty Ku. A+++ Service, Food, Atmosphere, Value.

Hokkaido Team: Thanks again guys and keep up the good work!! We love you guys so much, we will also leave you another review on Urbanspoon! 

Much Love, Alice & Family"}
{"text":"I have a friend that loves sushi however her husband has a severe seafood allergy so we always go for sushi whenever we meet for lunch. I'm not complaining, what a fun mission it is to try all the sushi places downtown!

Fuji Yama had closed down and re-opened as Hokkaido so of course we were stoked to try it out. Salmon sashimi here is really good - thick cut, fresh and marbled. The rolls (we had a spicy salmon and a dynamite-like roll) were hearty and delicious. 

It does get really busy during peak lunch hours (and therefore pretty loud), but it think it's worth the trek to the east edge of downtown for some quality sushi."}
{"text":"Do you ever notice how waiters or waitresses always wait politely for a second or so before they speak? If not, then this is the place to dine. Our waitress had this annoying way of always interrupting our conversation when she is just around the corner. Now I know I may be nitpicking here, a tentative waitress is a good waitress, however in this review, I would argue when that is not the case.

For instance, waiting for your patrons to acknowledge you before speaking is considered polite, I can pause my conversation and continue wherever I left off.  My second problem tonight was how our waitress kept shifting the plates on our table.  No I'm not kidding. As often as she appears out of thin air with questions, her hand easily appears out of no where and ever so slightly nudges our plates. It's considerate, to ensure that our food is in the centre, but please, don't do that when I'm eating off the plate. 

Second thing that was quite annoying was the kids there. Mind you, these were not kids of the other customers, no no, they were the restaurant owners kids, and their kids friends, and some other family's sons and daughters (we were the only customers there on a Sunday evening). These kids were running around, kicking and playing, as though it is their own place. Then you find their grandma making rounds around the restaurant trying to hush the screams of an infant child in her arms. 

Pretty bizarre dining experience.  I would have easily given this place a 1 star, however, the food was decent. Not the worst I've had. So as it's saving grace, 2 out of 5. If they ever improve their service and dining experience, I will return to this review."}
