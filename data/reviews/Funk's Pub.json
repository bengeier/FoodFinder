{"text":"Stopped in for a beer and a quick bite. Had a delicious Kentucky Bourbon Ale and ghost pepper wings. My wife had an IPA and a half order of nachos. Staff was very friendly, and the food was good pub food. Wings were not as spicy as warned, but tasty! We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Had lunch here a few times including today.  The food is good, service is usually good (was great today), and nice atmosphere both inside plus a small patio outside.

Typically, I get the Cubano sandwich or Buffalo Chicken Wrap, both are better than average compared to other restaurants.  The rest of the menu is typical neighborhood bar food like Chili's.

I also recommend the place for an after-work beer, really good selection of beers on tap, usually a special of the day, and a nice place to catch a game on the TV at the bar."}
{"text":"The waitress and/or the kitchen screwed up both our orders on a slow Saturday afternoon. When I said I just wanted to pay my check and go, they were telling me they had a corrected order ready for me. How do you cook a new burger in 5 minutes? Never going back."}
{"text":"Came in -it was busy and the only bartender was also the waitress... She totally worked the whole place and we never felt like she was stressing or rushing us or ignoring us.
Great Service from an obvious pro!! (She had long dark hair -didn't catch her name)

Booths were nice. Lots of tables and a very long bar. Bathrooms were Super clean.
Both of us had Rubens -they were very good and filling. Hand cut chips were good -not too thick either."}
{"text":"Went there for the first half of the USC-ND game on 10/19/13. We could not have been more warmly welcomed in Badger Country! Food and drink was excellent. Owner took time out on a busy Saturday night to talk with us. We will be back when we are in Madison."}
{"text":"Love coming here on game days! Good food  and great staff!! I would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"If you like to watch sports this place is awesome!  Lots of TVs and great food!  Visited for march madness with a group of 10 friends and had a blast!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch. Pretty nice atmosphere and friendly staff. The chicken nacho with cheese sauce appetizer is amazing! The half order of the dish was enough for me and the person I was with to split and feel full."}
{"text":"The serving staff and bartenders are very friendly and attentive.  Good selection of taps and good selection of TVs if you are watching a game.  I enjoyed sitting out on the patio and having a few drinks on a summer day.  The menu is good bar food and sandwiches.  SO MUCH BETTER THAN NAMIOS!"}
{"text":"We love this place, great service and staff! The patio out back is really a nice place to relax and converse. My favorite menu item is the sweet potato fries and the chicken fingers with ranch. They often have some interesting bands that play here that are worth checking out."}
{"text":"Visited Funk's Pub and ordered the California Turkey Reuben Wrap, Grilled Chicken Sandwich and Beef Nachos w/ Homemade Cheese Sauce for dessert. The food was absolutely delicious. We devoured these while watching The Crane Wives perform. Great hometown bar feel! Would definitely return to try out the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Funk's is a pretty generic neighborhood bar.
This being said, it's definitely on the upper side of that category.

It's very friendly and has a huge bar, which runs nearly the entire length of the room.
It's not really a sports bar, but always have the game on, and plenty of teevees, which is convenient.

The service is always great, and the prices are good too.
Haven't had a lot of food at Funk's, but the fried pickles are awesome. They're slices, not wedges, and very well done. Additionally, the Cuban sandwich is really good. Never a huge fan of the cheesecurds here, but they're not bad either."}
{"text":"Awesome food! We've been here a couple of times and the food has been consistently great for everyone at our table :) The service is really fast and our waitress was really friendly with an awesome sense of humor. The decor and painted tables are unique, locally done and really fun to look at too. Looking forward to checking out their jam nights on Sundays, some live music will definitely make this place even better!"}
{"text":"Great bartenders and great service. You'll get another drink right after your last, a never-ending flow of popcorn along with friendly servers. 10/10 would recommend. Come in on Tuesdays for all-you-can-eat delicious tacos"}
{"text":"An absolutely wonderful little bar and restaurant. I can't get enough of this place! Let's start with the decor of Funk's and a little history. If your from Fitchburg, you will know that there are not a lot of places that this location can sustain for some reason. It has been many businesses but all sort of the same style: A place to watch sports / pub.

Funk's is similar but adds a lot of its own flavor to make it unique. A whiff of New Orleans can be detected throughout the establishment with some unique artwork on the walls and photos. A pretty open layout is what you are welcomed with when walking into the \"front\" of Funk's, which can be a bit confusing the way its laid out in a small strip mall. Lots of tables that can accommodate a large group or just the two of you and a great, long bar that runs pretty much 75% of the length of the entire place! They have lots of giant TV's to watch whatever sporting event you need and a beer and liquor selection to match. Drinks are extremely well priced and plentiful! They even built a stage for live music with a lot of local talent to give you that night out you've always wanted. Next the food... and WOW THE FOOD!

I know what most of you are thinking... \"Small sports bar type place in Fitchburg? It's no Great Dane\" but you would be so very wrong. I have never EVER had a bad meal here and expect I wouldn't. Their menu sort of sticks to the basics but each one has its own unique twist that makes it a masterpiece. One of my favorites is the expertly crafted Cubano sandwich, which I of course have had multiple times. I've had assorted menu items in the past but just remember each one being spectacular. They also have a nice little patio to sit and enjoy your food or cocktails but it faces a bank but its still nice out there with the music playing.

The final piece and the biggest piece to why I gave this place 5 stars is the staff. These folks are some of the best people who I have ever had the pleasure of being served by. They are always so energetic, friendly, and extremely attentive. I've never been without water or drink any time I've been there. If it isn't busy they'll stop by where you are and just chat while always keeping an eye on other patrons and if someone else comes in. I absolutely love this place and hope this place lasts WAY longer than any of the other places the have come and gone here."}
{"text":"WOW. All I have to say is for AMAZING and high quality bar food, stop here. We got a few things, one being the chicken nachos. I have never in my life tasted something as good. I went in expecting poor quality bar food. We know some of the servers (real great guys) and we were going for support. But will be going back for the amazing food. We were advised the chef there takes the menu really seriously. Everything is handmade with lots of thought into the dishes. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Awful, just awful.  Not very busy Saturday night and it took more than 30 minutes to get our food...which was lukewarm to cool when it arrived. The waitress apologized twice, but that did not help when we missed our movie.  If I could give zero stars, I would.  Do not eat here under any circumstances."}
{"text":"Great service!  We stopped into Funk's for a quick lunch on a warm Tuesday.  The parking lot is a little odd, as I think we actually parked in the bank parking lot and walked into the back door of Funk's.  We sat at a high top table and were greeted promptly by our server who was fantastic.  My husband ordered the black and blue burger and I ordered the crispy chicken wrap.  

Our food came quickly and the waitress mentioned that she had the bbq sauce put on the side for me (I had asked for light bbq sauce) and while I totally get why she took that route, I was a little disappointed as dipping a wrap in sauce is not nearly as good as having the sauce inside.  Therefore my wrap seemed a little on the dry side.  But it was good!  And the portion size was larger than I expected.  My husband's burger was extremely juicy but greasy as well, it was pretty apparent that they didn't let the burger rest before serving it.  

Overall this is definitely a place we will be coming back to.  They have a great stage area and seems like a great place for date night.  They also have a kid's height chalkboard with a bucket of chalk for them to play with so I am actually excited (never thought I'd say that) to bring our 6 year old daughter out to eat with us.  There's also a popcorn machine which I know will be a hit as well.  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"The service was great. But the food was blah. My fish tacos were horrible. The fish tasted like bottom feeders. The steak sandwich was just hamburger. It was overpriced for the quality of food you got. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Great place! Margi is AWESOME :) Definitely recommend this for the atmosphere, food and drinks, PLUS the service is the FAB!!"}
{"text":"I've been there on Monday nights for a few weeks in a row for 105.5 Triple M's Project M, and I love the atmosphere. Nice stage for live music. Plenty of TV's. Staff is very friendly. Delicious sweet potato fries!"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, great place to watch multiple games at the same time, and great food!"}
{"text":"Like the area. Good beer list. Good food. Live music makes conversations impossible but that's to be expected somewhat. 

Their tomato soup is awesome! The nachos are also above average."}
{"text":"Went here with the family the other night because we wanted to try a new place with a pub-casual place to eat in southwest Madison area. It's slim pickings out in he 'burbs, but Funks Pub did not disappoint!

Great selection of beers (varying styles and breweries, macro and micro), Good wine selection for the casual wine drinker, and a really nice menu--not too large, but with a varied selection with options for the average Joe, fancier options for the \"adventurous\" (get the apple brie burger), and what seem to be some decent vegetarian options (if you're into that). 

What tipped this place into five stars for me was the fantastic service on the patio and the kitschy decor--our waitress was prompt, but also took the time to be friendly and personal. The decor and vibe were just a step beyond the usual pub atmosphere, very fun and not stale. 

We'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Funk's has a really chill atmosphere and a great menu- particularly for \"bar food\". They are hosting \"Project M\" right (for the radio station 105.5), and it was so great to see talented local artists perform."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for lunch seems like there is a new name and ownership every year. It was not very busy and our bartender was very friendly. We tried the hand battered cheese curds which I think were not actually hand battered there. However there were quite tasty with a side of ranch.

The chef actually came out and delivered our cheese curds and took our order. Which was kind of weird but I think in retrospec pretty cool. We decided to try the buffalo chicken wrap and the black and bleu burger she got the fries and I got the sweet potato fries. I thought the buffalo chicken wrap was good at first but as I got more into it, it tasted kind of salty. My gf thought the same about the whole order it almost seemed like the cook either thought everything is better with salt or this was his first job after working the fryer at mcdonalds.


I will return again and hopefully the salt shaker doesnt accidently fall on all of our foods. I really think it has a lot of potenial which is why I have gave it three stars. The customer service is fantastic, very friendly. The bites I had that werent covered with salt did taste good.

I think its worth it to check it out, they also have a stage for live music at night."}
{"text":"Stopped by today for lunch. Nice sized place with a bar area, dining area, outside patio - even a little state for bands or open mic. 

Friendly service, pretty good menu with choices ranging from burgers to wraps to sandwiches and salads. I tried the Cubano and my wife got the BLT. Both of us got homemade chips as well. My Cubano was good - I called it an amped up Cuban sandwich. Pork, ham, cheese, pickles and mustard - plus the added bacon and peppers. Messy but good. The pork had a strong seasoning that was almost over powering - the peppers were a great addition. Bacon was ok but didn't have that yummy bacon taste I was expecting. Wife said the same thing about her BLT - it was good, but bacon could have been better. Best thing was the chips - super thin but cooked great and SO tasty! 

Overall nice place. Posters said they had music many nights, definitely a place we will be back to."}
{"text":"Really love going here. Must have been a tough start for me.  Staff is friendly, attentive, and can handle some of the busy weekend crowds.   Love Sunday's open jam.   Ghost pepper wings are one of the main reasons i come.  Nachos can be half ordered and you can have both fresh (which gets melted) and the usual thick liquid nacho cheese.  Really love them.  Wish they had  wing night!"}
{"text":"This is such a fun place! My parents are regulars, so I stopped in with them and ordered a bowl of chili. To my surprise, it came with a delicious grilled cheese sandwich! I was thrilled, because I love grilled cheese, and the chili was belly-warming and rich, just as a good chili should be. The environment is very relaxed and inviting, and despite it being a bar, the restaurant area is rather large and spread out, which helps separate it from the \"pub\" side. My parents love the burgers, and while I haven't personally tasted one (I am stuck on that delicious chili each time I visit) the look very tasty. All in all, a great place to stop in for some great food!"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I have had in a long time!  I would definitely recommend you go here!  My hubs had the BBQ Pork sandwich and he said it was great!  Server was fantastic and it was a great find on a bad weather Sunday!!"}
{"text":"Met with family at Funk's! I have to say the location makes it a bit hard to find. I'm sure they can work around that though. 

There were four of us on this sunny Saturday afternoon. We decided to visit Funk's. We were all hungry and knew we wanted an appetizer for sure. We started off with the Creamy Spinach & Artichoke Dip. We all felt the dip was a bit too runny and the serving size was a tad too small. 

On to the entree's! 

One family member had the Brie & Apple Burger, it was a   1/2 lb. steak patty with fig jam, apple matchsticks and a cider reduction on a Kaiser roll. He ordered it with a side of pub chips. At first he enjoyed the burger. He said later on that it made him feel queasy later that day. Maybe it was a combination of the ingredients that caused this? IDK... 

Another family member ordered the Buffalo Chicken Wrap Grilled chicken breast tossed in buffalo sauce, with chopped romaine, fresh pico de gallo, cheddar jack cheese and ranch or bleu cheese dressing. She chose the bleu cheese option and said the wrap was \"good.\" 

I ordered the Southern BBQ Pulled Pork sandwich, Spicy house-braised pork shoulder with provolone cheese and BBQ sauce on a grilled ciabatta bun. It was good... I have declared this the best pulled pork sandwich I've ever had. This beats Smoky Jon's #1 BBQ in Madison, or Bob's Bitchin' BBQ in Dodgeville. I will be back for the sole reason of ordering this beautiful sandwich. 

I would definitely recommend Funk's Pub. Some food may be hit or miss, I believe there are some true treasures in that menu."}
{"text":"Waited more than 2 hours for our food.  Servers were incredibly rude, did not apologize for delays and actually harassed us for asking about it.  Food itself is mediocre at best.  Will never return.."}
{"text":"The food was good overall. But this is not the place to go if you want to have a normal conversation, it's too loud for that. I'm sure it's mostly a construction issue. We sat all the way in the back but still had a lot of sound carry over from the bar."}
{"text":"Wow - what a transformation!   This place has a great atmosphere.  It is a long bar so you do not feel lost in the room.  

I was really impressed with the quality of food. I like that I can get a soup and salad combo for under $10. There is something about this place that is so simple yet so delicious. I am always comfortable when I go there. I never really hand out there, instead I am always there to grab a quick bite to eat. Quick and quality are two great words to describe Funk's."}
{"text":"I was here to support a friend's musical performance.

I'll get my only criticism out of the way-- it's not well set up for live music.  The acoustics are terrible and you cant really see the stage.

Staff was friendly and hard working.  I didnt order any food but my table mates' food looked wonderful.  Wifi was fast and free.  Place was clean.  Parking ample.  No cover for live music (at least on the night was there)."}
{"text":"I decided to try Funk's for a quick burger to go.   My partner also ordered.   I had the black and blue and she had the Mexicali Jack.
The meat was excellent and with very good flavor.   Plenty of toppings and a really nice bun.   The MJ was same and we were both happy with them.
The atmosphere inside was pleasant. There were about 20 people inside so it wasn't crowded at all.   Bartender was pleasant as well.   
I will be back.  Park in the back there are entrances on the side and in back.  Plenty of parking space."}
{"text":"For a neighborhood pub, the food is definitely above average. The menu gives a ton of options, and you can even go healthy here if you want to. 

One big plus is that every burger on their menu can also be substituted with grilled chicken as the base. 

Beer list is very good for a local pub, lots of beer on tap and good variety in the flavors available. 

I would definitely seek out the Greek Burger, that is probably my favorite thing on the menu. When dining there last night, I had the tilapia tacos. Good effort there, marinated in chili sauce for a good kick, great sriracha aioli. 

Would definitely recommend this place if you are just looking for a better than average burger or sandwich."}
{"text":"Funk's is close to my home but I often overlook it when thinking about places to go to.  This may be due to the setup of the bar/restaurant which is long and narrow and feels somewhat cold.  Service has always been friendly and their tap list while not extensive has a few good craft brews.  Menu consists of the typical standards-Appetizers, Sandwiches, Salads, Burgers, etc.  On the few occasions I have stopped in, I went the burger route and wasn't thrilled but at the same time, wasn't disappointed.  And this pretty much sum up the place.  Not great.  Not terrible.  Friendly service moves it from a 3 star to 4."}
{"text":"Update: holy cow they increased the spice on their ghost pepper wings! Turns out that, like me,  many people said they weren't that spicy, so they upped it. Bigly. Whew!


Stopped in for a beer and a quick bite. Had a delicious Kentucky Bourbon Ale and ghost pepper wings. My wife had an IPA and a half order of nachos. Staff was very friendly, and the food was good pub food. Wings were not as spicy as warned, but tasty! We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I teetered between 3 & 4 stars.  The beer selection is a bit thinner than I prefer at a bar.   However the burgers were quite tasty.   Also had a side salad with their homemade ranch.  Yum.  Granted homemade ranch can make fresh roadkill taste good.  

Yes, I'll. admit we ordered the creme brûlée.  I know what your thinking.  At a bar?   Keep thinking that.  It wasn't bad.  But, it's creme brûlée at a bar.  

So given above it sounds like a three star.  Factor in the good service by the waitress that reminds me of Sarah Palin this place deserves a four.  

Order a burger.  Have a couple beers and enjoy."}
{"text":"We went to Funk's on Saturday because we've been curious to go there since Byrd's closed. I like the atmosphere with each table with a different design on it and all the eclectic art. I had the Cubano with fries. I liked the Cajun mustard and expertly roasted pork shoulder, the sandwich had really good flavors that married really well together (I have to say it's my new favorite Cubano!). Babe had the cheeseburger and while it was very good (I always get a bite) the patty itself lacked seasoning, but it was done perfectly and was very juicey.  That was really our only critique.  We usually try places on Saturday for lunch, because places are hardly busy and we find we get the best service and food. We definitely plan on going back, I can't wait to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"I liked the VIBE of Funk's. 

Nothing pretentious, Nothing slacking. Nothing but good people trying to make it work. The owners hosted us well (Jenny - wife and Mr. Funk). I even liked that he drank from behind the bar with his patrons (it was pop folks). 

My non-alcoholic drink could take lessons from Heritage but I appreciate the effort. 
I tried the Spicy margarita and it was flavorful not hot you can't taste your tongue. 
I tried the ghost wings and I have a sister-in-law that would still put Tabasco on top but she's a real Cajun Creole - I'm not. Yet, the homemade blue cheese dressing made these wings work. They get hotter as you keep biting. 

I like the video games. 

The open bar concept with booths to the back with a handmade stage area.

I love the tall ceilings. 
Location: In the mix with everything and you'll guilty because two gyms are next door. 
Pinnacle and Princeton Club XPress. 

I'm going to try and bring our University Ave Lights fundraiser here and I believe it will work not just because the owners are cordial; the staff seems sincere in liking their jobs but also the atmosphere. I can see their regular patrons feeling inclined to just join in the party versus feeling ousted by a separate event taking place. 

The bruschetta was nice
The rubens sans mayo mix (I'm allergic) was adorable. 
The chicken satay was actually FYAH (meaning good) as they were seasoned well and robust in flavor. Yeah, IKR, chicken on a stick --ooooohhh la la but this can be done wrong as some folks overcook it often. 

I don't drink but I wanted to see how a spicy margarita faired. I forgot or never got around to trying their regular margarita to do a real taste test but I'm sure real drinkers can say more than my review will afford. 

Beer and Drinks + New Menu Additions are listed on the chalkboards on the wall. 
I will return for the Buffalo Chicken Soup."}
{"text":"Good solid menu for a bar ghost chilli wing good heat meaty wings bbq wings were good solid burger choices like the western  Cuban sandwich solid like the homemade chips decent beer selection  reasonable kids menu friendly quality service not a regular but enjoyed it the handful of times we been there"}
{"text":"Nice meal over lunch, quick service. I thought the food was nice. Ita kind of a hole in the wall. I would come back for sure."}
{"text":"We were in on a Saturday (a little after lunch). It was super quiet and their were a few people in at the bar. We grabbed a high table in the bar area. I liked all of the colored motif inside the bar. My companion said that it was a bit over the top. We both got a local tap beer (great to see local beers represented at neighborhood bars). I went with the reuben sandwich and he got a burger. The reuben bread was a bit soggy and wasn't that appetizing. The fries were pretty good and disappeared pretty quickly. His burger was pretty good (cooked a little longer than he prefers) but he ate it anyway. He had a bite of my sandwich and noted the soggy bread and that it didn't have a whole lot of flavor. I had to agree with him. We will need to head back for their music though. It's nice to have a restaurant in this location and I feel bad that we're not supporting it more. There's just so many other great options nearby for food/drink."}
{"text":"Excellent menu. The black and bleu burger was good, sweet potato fries are excellent!
The server was slightly inexperienced and a little bit slow but not bad at all. Going from \"good\" to \"Great\" service would make this a five star location. They have a good kids menu, and the burgers and sandwiches have a variety of buns and bread available. Even the regular fries were good they were prepared with the salt. A bunch of little details make this a good experience"}
{"text":"Food and drink was great. Service was good. Dart league? Right by the door and our barstools. Super unfriendly and awkward."}
{"text":"Wasn't crazy about the atmosphere or the service. Seems like it's just average. They could easily step it up. With better service, friendlier bartenders, and some live acoustic music or something.  Not bad but nothing to bring me back."}
{"text":"so hmm....I just realized I've never reviewed Funk's even though I've come here off and on for quite some time.  I've always enjoyed the place, eaten here a few times and the food was good.  I've ALWAYS enjoyed the service from a couple of the regular bartenders...until I just went there and found out they're gone.  Dang!

It seems the service has been completely replaced by...well no one.  They have a hiring sign on the door...and I'm guessing the owner and his family are filling in?  We had terrible service...meaning NONE!  We had to leave our table and go to the bar to order, while the young woman who was supposed to be our server played on her smart phone.  After finally getting my drinks ordered....NOT by the older gentleman...he was too busy talking with his friends at the end of the bar to actually take orders from the multiple people waiting...anyway, I digress.  After finally getting drinks for my table (younger bartender...was trying to do a good job but handling everything by himself)...someone comes over to ask if we need service....now having been sitting there for well over 10 minutes without being acknowledged.  And no...it was not terribly busy...we were just being ignored.

I REALLY hope they get things sorted out.  I tried coming here off and on over 10 years...this location struggled to find a business and it seemed Funk's was really taking off and had a good thing figured out.  I'll be happy to give them a few more tries and update the rating if they can turn it around.....  best of luck!"}
{"text":"Cool little place!  Service was good, waiter was very attentive, food was above average quality and good portions."}
{"text":"I don't normally get out to Fitchburg much, but I decided to have lunch here after hearing their commercials on the radio several times. I'm glad I did, and I'll probably return soon! The atmosphere of the bar is very open, and there are several TV screens to watch when the \"big game\" comes on. The food is good too -- I had a simple cheeseburger, and while I wouldn't rate it in my top 5 in Madison it was still very delicious. Plenty of beers to choose from, and the service was phenomenal...the servers at Funk's made sure I was happy with my meal and had a fresh beer/drink in front of me when my pint looked close to empty. I'd definitely recommend this place as a good, neighborhood/sports bar worth checking out."}
{"text":"Recently went to Funks for lunch with the family. This was my third time at Funks. Each time I go, things are just okay. This time around I chose to order the veggie wrap. The best way I can describe this dish is a pasta dish with no pasta. It was a warm mess of grilled vegetables doused in basil pesto. The oil from the pesto, or addition of more oil, made for a messy wrap. Plus, the flavors were just, well, blah. 

Let's break the two stars down: 
1. GREAT Fried green beans. I've never had fried green beans before. They're now on my list to try at more restaurants. These were great because they green bean had a bite to them and the batter to green bean ratio was just right. 
2. One of the few bars in the area worth giving a try. Unfortunately, Fitchburg isn't the best place for eateries. Funks gets a star for being one of the better options in Fitchburg. (Doesn't say much, does it?)
 
Worth giving a go if you'd like to beer and an app. If you're looking for a great meal, I'd recommend another spot."}
{"text":"If you haven't had the fried pickles, their out of this world burgers and the Kentucky Bourbon Ale on tap here. .. you haven't lived!  Ohhhhh.... and the owners and ambiance are second to none!!!! :)"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly service and killer internet speeds would sum up my experiences at Funk's Pub. Being a person who make an office out of anywhere I can put my laptop, this is my new goto. The bar is spacious so I can spread out and take care of business. Music was constant, but not so loud that I couldn't talk or hear the other folks around me. I haven't seen music in the space yet, but it looks ready to go with the stage. Rock and Roll, Funk's Pub!"}
{"text":"The food and service are exemplary!  It is standard bar food and reasonably priced AND it still stands out to me above other similar places because it just tastes better.  Best BLT (add avocado, yum!) I think I've ever had.  Also my bf who orders a club sandwich everywhere we go says Funk's is his favorite.
To top that off, great service by Kim!  The other night, the side of homemade chips came out slightly overdone.  I didn't even notice and when I was asked about them, I said they were fine and a few minutes later, Kim came out with a fresh basket of them because she thought they should be better (and they were).
Other things I like are that it is open/spacious with plenty of seating (advisement most or all tables, at least in the bar area, are tall with stools.)  AND they have a patio.  
Highly recommended this place!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite place to head to for a drink and a bite after work!  The food is good, the beer is cold, and the staff are some of the best folks I know!  The service is impeccable and the atmosphere is really chill.  Family friendly!  

The shrimp on Friday is fantastic!

Go check it out if you haven't already!!!"}
{"text":"This place used to be Namios.  The menu hasn't changed.  The food is decent, but it's nothing spectacular.

When Funks took over, they did some remodeling and added a stage. There is often live music which is fun.  They seem to draw in a lot more people than Namios brought in. 

There are lots of tables, and plenty of space for a big group. There is also a long bar with plenty of seating.  TVs are everywhere, so you can watch whatever game is on."}
{"text":"Good food and great services.  We had burgers, and chicken strips.  Much like other bar food, it was excellent."}
