{"text":"The sign on the door says they open at 9:30.  Arrived with friends at 9:30 anticipating a delicious greasy breakfast.  At 9:40, still locked and with no activity inside, we left and went here - http://www.yelp.ca/biz/smileys-restaurant-and-deli-toronto#hrid:DAo4MmnCpU8OpOaicqfVKg   NB  Formerly Good Morning Toronto Restaurant, recently changed to Eva's Bar and Restaurant."}
{"text":"One of my favourite three word phrases: all-day breakfast.   It just so happened that I had to bring my car in for an emissions test and it just so happened that I was running on coffee only this morning when I popped by the CT on Danforth @ Main, so I figured it was a great opportunity to try a greasy spoon for breakfast. Yelp pointed this place out as a nearby resto, so I was in.   It's a ma-and-pa shop on the dark side of the Danforth, so don't expect Joy or Bonjour Brioche. Think more like The Sunset Grill, but with a little less sunset and three eggs.   $4.75 for three eggs, bacon, toast and fries. Since it's Greek resto as well, I substituted a Greek salad for the fries for a buck and added a bottomless coffee for another $1.50. On that note, I think the menu listed souvlaki on a pita for a measly $4.75 as well.   If you're in the hood and happen to be hungry, check it out. I left with a happy stomach, a wallet without a dent and a 3.5 star rating. In fact, I could have breakfast for dinner ..."}
{"text":"Walkin' down the danforth around 12pm, lookin' for a patio. It was the perfect weather, and the beer was a'callin' our names.  Found this place finally, right before Main. Yea, we walked here all the way from Warden.   (everything else was closed on the way) (so what if it was a wednesday afternoon) (i thought torontonian's love to drink)  The place was pretty small, but we defintely opted to go to the patio.  Oh, must metion..this place is either called Eva's or Good Morning. Don't know. The menu said Eva's. Yelp said Good Morning. The debit receipt said Good Morning. So..   The menu has a mix of canadian and chinese food. Didn't really try anything.  Had a pitcher of Canadian for 20. Kinda a a ripoff, considering bottles were 3.50..but whatevs. Icey cold beer was all we needed.  I would've rated this place 2 stars, for the sketchy washrooms, and kinda sketchy patrons, but the bartender/server was just so amazing. LOVE YOU GURL.   beercrest out."}
