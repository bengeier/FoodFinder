{"text":"I had high hopes going in from reading the previous reviews, unfortunately I was let down. Pork was flavourful, but cold and dry. Rice and potatoes were fresh, but low on flavour. Needed lots of hot sauce to give it any life. Value seemed pretty good and the service was friendly. I might give it another chance if I'm in the area in the future, but I should probably skip it."}
{"text":"Chicken was very good (BBQ) Rice was dry and the hot sauce is not home made... its like Tabasco sauce, i have tasted better at other Portuguese chicken take outs.  Over all good food."}
{"text":"BBQ is amazing no doubt.......went there last month.........."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 half chicken dinners, 1 calamarie dinner, 1 red snapper dinner and one whole grilled charcoal bbq chicken for our team at work. Food was very good except for the calamarie which was chewy.  The red snapper and chicken were amazing, all meals come with 2 sides. This place has lots of seafood options. A must try."}
{"text":"Amazing rotisserie and BBQ chicken. The hot sauce is truly the reason why this place is better than the rest."}
{"text":"The food is delicious.  They have really good fried pork and I love the potatoes. The staff is very nice."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. It may not blow you away, but if you're in the mood for quality Portuguese food, Uptown will do you right!  Their chicken with rice and potatoes (a classic) will fill you up for cheap. My only gripe is that the hot sance, as someone pointed out, seems like it's just Frank's Red Hot."}
{"text":"Great service, great price, fantastic food, fava beans were incredible and chicken is moist and delicious. Wow wow."}
