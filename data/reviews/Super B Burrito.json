{"text":"I have been to many Mexican food joints. This is by far the best. They provide great customer service here, and the food was amazing. Today i had a carne asada quesadilla and it was the most incredible quesadilla ive ever had. You need to check this place out!!!!"}
{"text":"Love the burritos and service here!  My preference is the breakfast burrito with bacon (and of course the green sauce) - and I haven't been disappointed yet!

Picked up a couple of other different breakfast burritos for friends visiting and all have loved!"}
{"text":"First time actually tasting \"nongreasy\" and \"fresh\" Mexican food-you will find it here!  Sauces are good. Had the steak burrito with rice.  Best mexican rice I've tasted.  They make the food when ordered and I appreciate that. Customer service- Nice! Only one or two people working there however.  Although the burrito is a  big portion, only negative is that they don't fill the sauces to the rim or their sides.    I would expect that for a $9 plate.  Also consistency, first order of the plate there was a few pieces of  chips, 2nd time I ordered the same plate none.  There definitely is a fly problem there as I was waiting in the drive thru. But I must say, you forget that when you take the food to your own home and taste the fresh tasting, non greasy food. I wanted to taste one of their \"fresh\" drinks and twice they told me they did not have that even though plenty of them where listed on their menu.  I would imagine they would be good and fresh as the food if they had their supply."}
{"text":"Super sucky burritos. Lauritas is just down the street and way better. Gave this place a second chance and was still horribly disappointed.

Super Burrito Super Sucks."}
{"text":"Well. I love super burrito. But, to be honest. Quit being cheap asses and have more than 1 man. Handling the register, the cooking, customers inside as well as the drive thru. I went in on Sunday. With only 1 poor dude working. He was very proffesional and our food did not take to long. I just feel for the kid. I used to be a mgr at capriottis. Doing all of that work I would b very almost upset."}
{"text":"Had a friend introduce me to this place and have found myself going back a lot. But just make sure you speak slow and make sure they understand your order.  But the food is always excellent"}
{"text":"The wait is finally over!!!! Super b is finally open!!! I just had some bomb a#= green chile pork tacos! They were to die for lol. Going bk very soon."}
{"text":"NORMALLY A FANTASTIC FOOD.. lately it's gone down hill. Paid $$$ for their Carne Asada Super Burrito.. The first couple times I ate there the burrito was HUGE and great value for the money. Well the people must be having gambling debt or something because the last couple times the burrito is half the size and you pay $$$$$ for these \"Super Burritos\".

 The guy had a really bad attitude today when picking up $30 worth of lunch for me and co-workers. 

 Sad this place has gone down hill. We won't be eating Stupid Burrito again. Sorry!"}
{"text":"Food was okay but the price is alright for it. The service was quick."}
{"text":"$1 tacos, decent price burritos for the size. Love the carne asada. My husband and in-laws are mexican and I grew up in SoCal. Sometimes there is a bit of a wait but there is usually only one person working, maybe two if it is a weekend. Definitely our go-to place for mexican food here!"}
{"text":"Eating here now with my girlfriend for the first time. The food and service was good but the choice of music is not appropriate. Foul language and the \"n\" word used excessively. This is a Mexican place and you are playing inappropriate getto music. I don't think we will be returning just because I can not bring girlfriend and esp my family back. So sad because the food was good."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in town. Not only do they have great food  (and at this point I've tried most things on the menu) but they also have the most friendly and accommodating staff. I love super b burrito and would recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"Really friendly service with good food! The restaurant was very clean and the menu had a wide variety of good food. I had the super burrito with steak and it was tasty and filling. Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Was craving a breakfast burrito so figured a place with a name like this oughta have good burritos. Drive thru wait was longer than I expect for a drive thru. Was charged for food I didn't order. Cashier did fix and reimburse. The food wasn't anything great. As basic as a burrito can get. Won't be returning. I'll stick to robertos."}
{"text":"Had a \"super burrito\". the size was decent could've been thicker (from San Diego, CA used to big burritos). The meat was cooked well and seasoned right. Haven't tried their other items, will be coming back though"}
{"text":"I live right by this place and remembered today why I don't come more. This morning I ordered a chorizo burrito with no beans, a chile relleno, and a side of sour cream. I got home and my burrito was full of beans, the Chile was so greasy that all the bag and everything in it was covered with grease and the sour cream was chunky and old. I'm so mad and disappointed. Don tor taco is cheaper and better quality if you looking for fast Mexican food with a drive thru"}
{"text":"The food and service here is on point. You have to try the green chile pork super fries! I come here at least once a week."}
{"text":"Burrito was pretty good. Whoever says these burritos are like the ones in the Mission either haven't been to the Mission or are just liars. The burrito had pico and sour cream but those were the only similarities shared with its Nor-Cal cousin. I like all the SF pics, but the burrito was meager just like all the other burritos in this dessert. I was so stoked too! Bummer.

And good price? I paid $7 for a carne asada \"super\" burrito. Not bad, but with no leftovers not cheap either."}
{"text":"Found this little gem because the bf and I didn't want to wait an hour for the Sunrise Cafe. It's just around the corner and doesn't disappoint! I got the steak and egg burrito...I'm from SoCal and this is by far the BEST breakfast burrito I've had. The green salsa is a perfect match (mild and tangy with a hint of some type of vinegar). The chips are the real deal...the kind that are crunchier and thicker, also pair well with the burrito. It's way off the strip but I'd come back for sure...it will def cure any hangover!!!"}
{"text":"If I was to rate the environment, cleanliness and the ladies behind the counter, 5 no problem. Unfortunately I came for take out and the food was average. I had a carne asada burrito with pico de gayo, rice, beans, guacamole and cheese. My burrito had everything I asked for but was not very tasty and very inconsistent. 

The burrito had a ton of beans, maybe even three times more than anything else and pretty salty for my taste. There was almost no guacamole and when I found where it was, the guacamole wasn't even mashed and looked like 1/4 of an avocado just thrown in half assed. Hardly any cheese but the meat was good. Ended up just opening the burrito up and taking the best out. Tossed out a good amount. I'd prefer to drive a little further to Faustos or Robertos for my fast food mexican cravings."}
{"text":"I don't get the positive reviews. Close to $7.00 with tax for a mediocre normal sized carne asada burrito. If the burrito was $4.50 it would be reasonable. It was Super in name only, only a Super fail.  Extra star for the hot sauces that I liked."}
{"text":"Almost all the good Mexican restaurants near where we lived have closed over the past 2-3 years so we found ourselves having to drive ever-farther from home to find good burritos. That is, until we saw some poor soul with a yellow Superman-type T-shirt swinging a huge arrow-sign  with \"Super Burrito- Super Good!!!!!\" standing on a sidewalk near this place. We didn't want to encourage that sort of threatening advertising so we didn't go in that day, but once we did get here, we found out it was indeed Super-Good (with one exclamation point at most, though.)

The menu is short and sweet- burritos! Many different types and sizes to choose from and mix-and-match, from the mini bean-and-cheese to the Super Burrito with guac, rice, pico and your choice of meats (or vegetarian.) We haven't been bold enough to try the tongue burrito, but the chili verde and carnitas are definitely good, as well as the more basic chicken and non-seasoned beef varieties. They also have some enchilada and tamale plates on special but we haven't had those because the burritos are really what you have to go here for. 

As befits a kind of dive-type place, the ingredients are only so-so but put together pretty well once they get in the flour tortillas. The meats are all well-seasoned and the pinto beans are pretty well seasoned too. Chips and salsa is worth it if you are thinking a Super Burrito might not satisfy your hunger, (not sure that would be possible) but you might want to avoid the chips with a nacho cheese sauce which seems to come right out of a can.

There's plenty of seating if you want to stay, but you would have to be a fan of ranchero or corrida music because the owners (or workers) are big fans of a radio station that plays it pretty much nonstop. In a way, though, that fits the general vibe of the place- a burrito bar transplanted from some more urban place (in this case, San Francisco) and plopped down on the dividing line between Las Vegas and Green Valley. 

All in all, if you are looking for pretty good burritos at a fair price, a little out-of-the ordinary and cheesy advertising, Super Burrito is definitely for you."}
{"text":"Really fresh, which was surprising because we ordered as they were closing and we are not strangers to rushed last meals of the day. The quality was still really good. Disappointing they were out of some things but again end of the day order so I can't complain too much. The pork verde burrito is spot on. All of their meat is very flavorful and the sauces really step it up a level.  It won't kill your budget and amazingly no digestive fireworks after. We got our food to go and it was fast and spot on. Worth a revisit."}
{"text":"The taste of La Mission!! Rudy brings the flavors of San Francisco to Sin City! YUMMIES."}
{"text":"I've had better Mexican food in a Bowling Alley Cafe!!

I could go off an on a rant for 7 paragraphs about how bad this place is and why but I will make it very simple for everyone;

Go to Fausto's, it's right down the street and is the best little Taquería in Las Vegas/Henderson by FAR! WAY better quality and quantity for a much better price.

p.s. If you have any doubt about my position in this then next time you take your money to SB, go ahead and stand up and watch them make your order. Nuff said..."}
{"text":"Ate here 3 times in 4 days.  Favorites were carnitas and fresh watermelon agua fresca.  Only complaint was nacho cheese sauce on the nachos.  Real cheese would be so much better."}
{"text":"Waited in the drive through line for over 20 minutes behind one car. When I got to the cashier, I paid, and had to wait again.... Currently waiting on 3 burritos, all of which are the same. 
How hard is it to make a burrito when you are a burrito store. 
Absolutely insane that the worker didn't even apologize. 
Not worth the diarrhea"}
{"text":"First time here at super burrito and it was GREAT!! Got 5 carnitas burritos, me and all the guys loved it. this place has a home cooked taste to it. The meat was fantastic! The woman behind the counter was very friendly and took time to help me decide what to get everyone. She was great!! Highly recommend
Great service and food. They care about what they are serving you here which is hard to do find anymore."}
{"text":"Super Bull$h*t
Lots of other choices in the area that you won't break your teeth at.

First time here.  Chorizo breakfast burrito...First half was ok.  
...And then I started getting bites that felt sandy and gritty.
...And then I pulled a quarter inch round rock out of my mouth.
...And then I never went back

Not cleaning the potatoes before they're shredded?
Dropped chorizo on a dirty-a** floor and scooped it back up?
Do I really want to know??!"}
{"text":"Hendry always being help and friendly, Oscar always made good foods my fav one is Taco salads and Fajita plate...very good"}
{"text":"These guys are awesome again! Food is yummy. Great service with a smile. I'm so addicted to their carne asada super burrito. And their Verde sauce is really good. Love them!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, they never come to the drive through, when I tried to go inside and have my order taken they were extremely rude instead of getting an apology they had a million excuses and then I tried to speak to a manager to let them know their employees can't do what they have been hired for and they denied me a manager they began to yell at me and tell me to get out it's a shame because I am going to spread the word for everyone I know not to set foot in such a nasty plac"}
{"text":"Really disappointed with the LACK OF FLAVOR. I gave it 3 stars because of the service and cleanliness. I paid 2.25 for tacos and it was just PLAIN. I usually eat at TACO MEXICO and thought i should give this place a try. The hot sauce lacked flavor and is watery."}
{"text":"Consistently good food since back in the day when they were in the old Farm basket building on Trop and Eastern. The prices have not changed with the times. Food for two for under $20! Also the person working the counter was super nice and didn't skimp on the green sauce in my to-go order :)"}
{"text":"The best chile verde and steak!!! The owner is from the Bay Area which is my hometown..and they are the only place with a super burrito (somethn only in Cali that is non-existent here in NV). Very happy with service and food."}
{"text":"If you want a nice, light, refreshing Mexican taste with abbot of a twist then this is the place to go. My child's preschool is in the same center so stopped in for a bite one evening as recommended by the owner of my kids school. I was impressed with the friendly gentlemen behind the counter and the food."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim, always driving by but never stop. The food was all fresh and tasted that way. The wait staff was polite and the food came out quickly. Chips were included with my burrito! The cost was cheap but the quality was refreshing."}
{"text":"The Chile Relleno burrito is FIRE! Best in town. I would of posted a pic, but that burrito didnt have a chance lol"}
{"text":"I'm very selective about my Mexican food especially being from LA and living some years in San Diego. We've been here once before and it was good but I had only ordered a chorizo breakfast burrito. Today I ordered their carnitas and oh man were they good! The staff has always been very friendly but the guy in the drive through was really nice....wish I would've gotten his name to give him a shout out! I'll be back, only thing is I wish they had received beans instead of whole pintos but I can work around that!"}
{"text":"It's a no brainer just do it that got fantastic food. Breakfast burritos are the best and don't forget the jalapeño and onions"}
{"text":"Another place that we frequent. Our staples at this delicious joint are the super fries with green chili pork (came recommended from the awesome guy behind the counter) and every once in awhile the bean and cheese burrito. Trust me, once you try these super fries you won't want to eat anything else!!!"}
{"text":"My babe and I are waiting for our oil change and this place is right next to it. This place is the best asada fries I've ever eaten! The meats are AMAZING!!! And big portion too! DELICIOUS!!"}
{"text":"They forgot part of my order. My burrito tasted like it had rotten parts, and they stufffed it with romaine lettuce. Who does that!!!?!"}
{"text":"I went here expecting a super burrito but it's a different company with a similar name. The food was pretty good and a place I'd probably go back to. Didn't stand out as exceptional."}
{"text":"I vaguely remember grabbing a breakfast burrito here once, but it was sufficiently average to be unmemorable. I returned recently for lunch and got a chile verde pork super burrito. Burrito was decent, found it curious that a super burrito includes guac and sour cream but no cheese, which I will add on my next visit. The chile verde itself was solid with a bit of heat to it. Oddly, the green salsa has no spice whatsoever- but it's chunky and just slightly tart, rendering it especially tasty to me, even if it doesn't add the spice I'd been wanting. 

Bonus points for having a drive-thru. Orders come out super quick. I placed my order via Eat24 from a few blocks away, expecting to wait, but it was ready when I rolled up just over five minutes later!"}
{"text":"AMAZING authentic Mexican food in a super clean, nice environment. The ingredients seemed of a higher quality than most places like this. The cashier spoke perfect English and our food was ready in less than 10 minutes. They also have a drive thru! Definitely coming here again! 

**Update: this place has become my #1 go to for tacos over any other place. Also ordered from them thru UberEATS and literally got my food in under 15 minutes which is AMAZING and it was still super fresh! 5 stars!**"}
{"text":"Love everything about this place. Very clean, nice environment to sit and eat. Very friendly staff. They also have a drive thru, which I will be taking advantage of in the future. The food was fresh and delicious!!! I got the Super Burrito and Super Tacos, Sooooo good!!!"}
{"text":"Been a while since I've ate a burrito. A very unusual adjustment considering that I lived on Mexican food back in LA. But since I'm in Vegas for school, I don't know much about the local joints for tasty food but this came to my attention and it had its share of good reviews, but also disappointing ones. I'm stuck in the middle but I would consider myself slightly disappointed rather. I got the chorizo super burrito for somewhere around six bucks. Not too sure of what the exact price was. But anyway, the burrito was good for a first try. But I don't see myself coming back. There was no condiments and the complimentary hot sauce was no bueno. There was also a bit too much salt in the burrito. If that's what makes up for their taste in a burrito, I'd rather head to taco bell. Save your money and drive down 2 miles south to Fausto's."}
{"text":"Nacho (beef) was super delicious I ate so fast that I forgot to take a pic. San Fran burrito was awesome- great flavors. Service was fast..."}
{"text":"Great food , outstanding customer service definitely my spot to go from now on very close and convenient,  I truly recommend it."}
{"text":"The place is simple, no fancy shmancy seatings just the perfect local spot to grab good food and enjoy. The wait was a little long but heck i understand, the food is good and plus you only have two hard working guys running the kitchen. Overall, i was satisfied with my San Francisco Burrito and Super Fries... i'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"This was first visit, I ordered the Super Nachos.  I like that they used nacho cheese and not melted shredded cheese.  The prices were very good compared to other places that serve basically the same items.  Service was fast and the food was pretty good.  My only complaint is the nachos seemed to have too much salt.  I am not a big fan of salt so this may not be an issue for other people who like a lot of salt.  Next visit I plan to try one of the burritos."}
{"text":"The overall quality of Mexican food in Henderson makes me want to cry.  Most of the decent taquerias are at least several miles away on the east side of Vegas.  And with the exception of the Lindo Michoacan chains in Henderson, I haven't found any food that is Mexican and noteworthy within the town limits. . . 

That is until Super Burrito opened recently.  Driving down Eastern a few months ago, I suddenly noticed the place were there.  So I stopped in.  And after the first visit, I've kept stopping in and stopping in and stopping in and stopping in. . .  

Super Burrito is a top notch taqueria.  They do a great job with the classic burritos-- carne asada and chicken.  Well-prepared meat with delicious beans, rice, cheese, sour cream and guacamole in a nice tortilla.  Each time I order one, I weep for my teenage self who suffered by repeatedly ordering Taco Bell, not knowing what he was missing.

If that was all that Super Burrito did, I would give them a solid 3.5 stars, but what pushes them into the four star range are the different sauces and flavors they cook into their meats.  I have fallen in love with their green chile pork.  Spicy and sweet and tender.  It mixes perfectly with warm pinto beans and just makes me happy.  I've also tried the coca-cola pork, which was crispy and interesting, but a little sweet for me.

Each time I go in now, I make sure to ask what meats they have in case they offer something new to wow me.  Whether they come up with new offerings or not, Henderson finally has a good taqueria.  And that's something to celebrate.  I have no doubt that the town council will host a parade in Super Burrito's honor right after they have their first taste."}
{"text":"The last two Mexican places in this spot failed bad. Third time was a charm. I tried the carne Asada and they actually let me try it before I ordered (which could in itself be a problem since that shows that the Carne is already made and in a warming dish). Either way, they cut all the fat off and it literally is just the meat involved in whatever you choose to put it in. Originally, I ordered the bowl, but they were out of bowls, and I declined the offer to throw everything into a styrofoam container instead. So I regrouped and ordered my first Torta. Ok, there was too much going on in there with guac (pretty good), lettuce, beans on the Torta and the meat is still pretty tasty, so I would stick to the tacos or maybe a regular burrito without anything but meat and rice on my next visit. As long as the carne remains void of fat (a huge rarity in my life) this is the go to place for worry-free Carne Asada now. Oh, I used the walk-up window and the cashier was muy bueno."}
{"text":"Delicious, fast, and convenient. I found it on Yelp, placed the pickup order on Yelp, and picked up the food through the drive thru10 minutes later. It was awesome!

Thanks Super B"}
{"text":"If you like overpriced food then this is your place!!!  And don't expect a breakfast burrito at breakfast time because I have been by twice at 8:30am and even though the door says they open at 8, its not true.  The 3rd time I came was the last time for me.  $6 and change for a bean and egg burrito is absurd."}
{"text":"Really cheap, fast, good lunch spot on days you are really hungry and short on time! The price is right too. For what it is..they are as good as it gets. They are not a 5 star restaurant. .but for a kick as taco shop...they deserve a 5 star review. Staff os reall friendly and keep the place very clean. It is a plesant atmosphere. ..you know how some taco shops smell almost clinical. ..not this place. Love it he..can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"OK, I know many of you may not get it, my husband doesn't , but I love this place. It might be nostalgia, I lived in No Cal and there was a Super Burrito right by my work. I went there all the time. I didn't have a lot of cash living in Cali, so I usually got the Bean and Cheese burritto.  I love the seasoning, the whole beans and the real cheese.  I can make a refried bean burrito at home. This one is unique.

Now that I can afford it, I've moved up to the carne asada Super Burrito. With their verde salsa, I can't think of much better.  PS you must have the salsas, they rock!"}
{"text":"I have waited a long time to write this review. I was here in February of 2016. I remember having very good service from the guy I spoke to through the drive through, however a few hours after eating I had a terrible case of food poisoning. It was not fun at all, I understand that this was probably a rare occurrence due to  an undercooked batch of chicken, however I will not be returning. I have never had food poisoning before so I am traumatized from this experience."}
{"text":"Great place to eat, not many Mexican food spots in Las Vegas that feel and taste authentic. Workers are nice people and make sure you come out of there a happy person. Have gone twice now and will continue to go as I am new to Las Vegas from Los Angeles."}
{"text":"AHhh, so good, love the pork burrito! Guys that make the food are super nice. Loved all the SF decor.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Flavors from the Mission of San Francisco, reminds me of home.  Restaurant is always clean and service is good. I always order the Henry (malito) burrito which is not on the menu. It's the 2nd most expensive item they have but for under $9 it is a steal. It is easily a meal and a half."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is good and the staff is friendly. I would recommend stopping in and trying the breakfast burritos."}
{"text":"Freshest breakfast burritos and juicy, flavorful, delicious meats. Their carne asada and pork is really tasty. I've tried their tacos, nachos and burritos and have yet to be disappointed. 

Also, the fact that they have a drive thru is such a plus. 

Grab a breakfast burrito on a Sunday for a great hangover meal or try their San Francisco burrito (basically a \"California burrito\") - you can't go wrong. I think I like this place so much because you can tell just by looking at their food that it is cooked fresh and with quality ingredients. 

Super B Burrito doesn't serve greasy, cheap canned food that's ready in a couple of seconds or heated in a microwave. It's kind of like a cross between Roberto's and Chipotle - not as greasy and heavy as Roberto's with quality ingredients that remind me of Chipotle,, while still maintaining that authentic Mexican taste. 

Yum! :)"}
{"text":"I stopped for my car service and this place was conveniently located.

Humble people run this establishment, so I found it very warm as soon as I came in.

My order was cooked surprisingly fast and the taste did not disappoint.

We need more local restaurants like these."}
{"text":"I'll recap the last minute of my life for you: I polished off my burrito and immediately texted Boyfriend to tell him that we never have to go to Roberto's ever again. This place is that good.

The restaurant is big and open, with plenty of little tables. It's very clean. 

I was greeted when I walked in and was given a minute to look at the menu, without pressure. The menu is small, which I like in a place like this. Granted, I only looked at the burrito options, but this is how it works: they have all the different Mexican food formats (burritos, tacos, tostadas, quesadillas, etc). So you pick your format, then you pick your meat (there are like 8 meats to choose from, which is awesome). The prices are based on the format, not the meat, which is a breath of fresh air. My decision came down to toppings. The Super Burrito has pinto beans, your meat, pico de gallo, sour cream and guac. The regular burrito has just beans, meat and pico. I chose a regular carnitas burrito.

To. Die. For. This is definitely a quality vs. quantity thing. The burrito isn't huge, but enough to fill you up. The tortilla was warm and pliable and didn't even think about falling apart mid-meal. The beans were..beans. Not much you can do with those. The pico was delicious (heavy on the onion, just like I like it!). The carnitas was killer. Moist meat with crispy bits from the grill. At the bottom of the burrito was my favorite part: that delicious meat/bean/pico soup that collects down there. YUM! As if that was not enough, I sampled both of their hot sauces: the red \"hot\" and the green \"mild\". The hot wasn't \"grab a glass of milk\" hot, more of a smokey, pleasant heat. The green salsa was my favorite! It seems to be a puree of cilantro, onion and maybe some garlic. Like pureed chimichurri...heaven!

Super friendly, super fast service with really, really tasty food. I couldn't ask for anything more!"}
{"text":"This place was just aight. I'm from the Bay Area and saw the sign saying they were from the bay, and thought to myself \"I will go there.\" Well, I went later that day and was thinking of the humongous super burritos I'd get in the Bay Area... Like, at taqueria farolito that had helllllla ish inside. You could eat half and be full and save the other half for dinner... But nope, these were like Taco Bell-sized burritos . Upside is that they put good guac in it, downside is that there was hardly any meat... Just a ton of beans . If you're expecting a Bay Area super burrito, this ain't it."}
{"text":"Oh my GOD!!! I just had the best Super Tacos of my life .   Got one chicken one steak .... now that's what what u call real Mexican food.   Thanks guys"}
{"text":"This food is good spicy and hot lovin it. I highly recommend it if you want to have a quick lunch."}
{"text":"This place is open 24 hours, not too far from the airport (though a bit of a drive from the strip--I guess I haven't really found a place that is a proper hole-in-the-wall burrito place NEAR the strip, I'd rather not eat burritos at CHIPOTLE or Treasure Island...) and it was pretty cheap.  

The salsa is AWESOME (picture above).  

They definitely need more people staffing it.  There was one guy.  ONE GUY.  I went at a weird time and there were say 6 people hanging out just waiting for him to take everyone's orders and then cook it all up himself.  

I sure hope he's not working there for all 24 hours..."}
{"text":"Exceptional service and exceptional taste!   I kept driving past this place for years, always vowing to stop by one of these days.    When I drove past again one time, I finally said enough is enough and made a U-turn.   

Everything here is made to order and my wife and I enjoyed our lunch.  I had a taco salad with deliciously seasoned chicken while my wife opted for the super fries with steak.    Hers came with guacamole, sour cream, and pico de gallo.  Green and red hot sauces were available at the counter.   I finished my food and started picking at my wife's fries like a vulture.   Yummy.  

The portions of the food were very generous and the price of the food will not even place a dent on the budget.   Highly recommend this joint if you're craving a quick burrito or taco fix.   I shoulda tried this place a year ago!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and loved it!! Their chili verde is as good as in California! Love this place and will be back. Very clean, professional and great service. I have my eye on there breakfast burrito next! This is a must try! Also the drive throughout idea is genius, but food is as good as a sit down Mexican restaurant :) great menu, wonderful food!"}
{"text":"Consistently makes the best burritos in Vegas. I've driven across town multiple times just to eat here. The carnitas super burrito is amazing"}
{"text":"Super B is just plain wonderful. From the great service to the yummy food! GREAT CHILI RELLENO!!!   Burritos and tacos are awesome."}
{"text":"Breakfast burritos made the way you want it. I opted to try an egg white, bacon, and avocado burrito. All breakfast burritos come with beans,  cheese,  and hash browns.  ( hold the beans plz) My meal was made fresh without the long wait. The burritos were prepared well and had all flavors hitting the taste buds with a since of urgency. That green sauce tjat comes with it is the best."}
{"text":"3rd day in a row for lunch.. I am addicted to their Chili Verde..  It's the best I've ever tasted! So tender and flavorful..
Large portions too! Friendly staff as well."}
{"text":"Ordered their asada torta and must say it was pretty good. Going to have to taste the green sauce and carnitas that others have reviewed as really good."}
{"text":"Finally, Henderson (or the border with Henderson) has a good taqueria. Super B Burrito brings the simple, fresh and tasty flavors of a classic taqueria to the Vegas suburb.  The guacamole: fresh and oh so good.  The pinto beans: fresh and tasty.  The salsa and hot sauce: fresh and spicy.

Super B Burrito does the classics right.  A carne asada super burrito (around $5 plus tax) comes with rice and beans, guacamole, salsa, cheese and sour cream.  And it's good.  Real good.  Even the tortilla is well textured and chewy (i.e. not out of the freezer).  You may have noticed a repetition of the word \"fresh\".  It's a simple, but necessary concept for a great burrito.  Super B Burrito understands that and it's a solid taqueria because of it (and in a valley that has suffered so long with the 1-2 day old tastes of Roberto's, it's revolutionary). 

But don't think that Super B Burrito only offers the classics.  If you're a meat eater, this is your place.  They prepare pork, steak and chicken in a variety of manners.  I had the coca-cola fried pork in my burrito and it was tender and sweet, but not over-the-top sugary.  Here's how good that pork is: I always (always) order a carne asada burrito when first testing a taqueria.  But when we stepped into the place, the guy behind the counter found out it was our first time there and started offering samples of the various meats.  The pork in green chile was spicy and delicious.  But there was no challenger to the coca-cola fried pork.  It's what will keep me going back again and again. 

Unfortunately, one of the folks that came with us ordered the vegetarian burrito and it was less than stellar.  Super B Burrito basically serves up the super burrito described above without the meat as a vegetarian option.  They do add in some lettuce, but it needs a little more oomph--either the typical fajita veggies or at least a couple different types of beans would help immensely.  Without that you really notice the lack of the meat addition.  

So four stars for the pork burrito, two stars for the vegetarian.  How did we get back to four stars overall?  The customer service is exemplary.  Friendly, quick and willing to educate the customer on the taqueria's specialties.  The guy who helped us was so awesome that we were sold on supporting the business before tasting the burrito.  I will definitely be back as a repeat customer.  Hopefully, they'll improve their vegetarian burrito and we can bring the vegetarian back again for another try."}
{"text":"I had a carne asada burrito from this place a few days ago & have been sick ever since. I see I am not the only one who's written a review regarding food poisoning. Eat here with caution."}
{"text":"Their torta cubano with beef instead of pork is unbelievable. Must order. Super fries are okay. Robertos does those better. Faustos has a similar burrito. But that torta."}
{"text":"Here is a little background about San Francisco bay area super burritos.  It is a giant belly bomb with meat, cheese, bean, rice, sour creme, guac, and pico wrapped in a giant tort and then wrapped up in tin foil.  They are all over the bay area.  There basically isn't a taqueria within 100 miles of the bay that if you walked in and asked for a super burrito that wouldn't serve up this delight exactly like this for around 6 bucks.  I have actually carried on La Tapatia burritos multiple times through security at the airport when I come back from visiting home.    

Some of you might be saying, that is no big deal, sounds like chipotle.  Well Mr. Chipotle was working in S.F. and fell in love with these burritos and went back to denver and started up chipotle.  It's true, check it out on wiki if you don't believe me.  Now for me chipotle dozen't really cut it because it's like a watered down corporate version of what a S.F. burrito really is but thats another story.  Imagine a big chipotle burrito but made with the greasy salty food from roberto's and you are close to what it is all about.      

I digress, the owners of this place are from the bay area and they serve up the authentic thing.  If this place was in S.F. it would be a very average burrito place but considering we are in vegas and that this place is pretty legit it hits the spot for sure.  Their burritos are actually a little small for what is normally standard but in reality they are still plenty big enough for all but the biggest gluttons and they are under 6 bucks to boot.  Their 2 locations are the only places in vegas serving these up that I know of (besides chipotle and it's rip offs).  If you know of more help a brother out.   I am going to try their other and way closer location soon but I don't imagine it is any different.

FYI this place for some reason dozen't have rice on their super burrito so if you want the super authentic thing just ask for it and they will put it on, it's better with it IMHO.  

Their steak is all I have tried and it is quite tasty, it's lean, tender, and flavorful.  They advertise that they use sirloin.  Their chips are pretty awesome too and I overheard someone talking about how they have the best super nachos in the world so it's probably worth a try, they are under 6 bucks too."}
{"text":"This place is the super goods. I just moved in down the street and its open 24 hours. It takes forever but they dont fire up the carne until you order it. The tacos are a buck each and the burritos are big. Everything is good. The red salsa is super hot and the green sauce is tasty. Mix them together. The carnitas are BOMB with lime and green sauce. Real street tacos they even throw some pinto beans in."}
{"text":"Hooray...they reopened!!! We drive past many  mexican restaurants just to get Super B's fajita burrito! This burrito has such a great flavor with  lots of fresh peppers and onions (clearly not frozen) with your choice of meat. The employees are really friendly too. So glad they are back in business."}
{"text":"We love this place! Fantastic and fresh food. And you get a lot of bang for your buck. 
Super friendly employees also. The customer service is amazing!"}
{"text":"I ordered super nachos delivery and they have were the worst. They came without beans, which are supposed to be included obviously, and the cheese is fake. Horrible Mexican food."}
{"text":"Pretty good Mexican food. Like there beans and rice for sure! Thanks!"}
{"text":"It's gone down hill as far as I can tell.. The burritos we ordered were cold and what little cheese they  did put on wasn't even close to being melted.. I'll move on, there's better choices out there"}
{"text":"Ordered through uber eats. This was by far the worst meal ever placed in front of me. I ordered a side of queso and guacamole. Both were missing. Also ordered 5 rolled tacos. 2 of them weren't rolled tacos but just pieces of shell (photos attached) also they were burnt so much they wee inedible. The side of rice and beans were a whole different pile of sh*t. The rice was so hard and stale. I attempted to bite into it and hurt my teeth. This was also pictured. What a disappointment. When I attempted to call Super Burrito the girl that answered the phone didn't speak English. What a waste. DO NOT eat here"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican drive thru! 

Update! The super soft taco is my new favorite. Amazing! Two corn tortillas overrated with carne asada, Pico de Gallo, and pinto beans. Delicious! 

I am in love with the small corn quesadilla with carne asada. They are absolutely delicious. I smother them in green sauce and I'm one happy camper! 
I've tried the tostada... It wasn't as good. The shell got really soggy, maybe I need to eat that first next time. 
I also once accidentally ended up with the flour queasadilla (I think it was there accident, not mine but who's counting) instead of my beloved corn queasadilla. It was good, but I'm sure I'll never swap them out. And going forward Im very careful to expressly make sure they know what kind I want. It's Yummy!"}
{"text":"Stopped by on my lunch break...we ordered the breakfast burrito and super Fries and 2 soda's

Breakfast burrito was missing potatoes and cheese from ingredients listed on menu and overall was bland....

the soda machine must have been out of syrup as 3 of the flavours we tried tasted like flavoured water and not soda...

The super fries were definitely NOT 'super'...

Only positive was service was friendly and fast but given the food and soda was so bad for nearly $24 we definitely won't be coming back here anytime soon!"}
{"text":"Delicious. I come here every Saturday morning for a breakfast burrito. The cashier is always very kind. This place is a definite gem."}
{"text":"Love this Place and I'm Happy to say we wont have to wait long to get their AWSOME!!! burritos. I found out that they will be re-opening the place back up by June 1,2015!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"There is no reason to eat Mexican anywhere else... the search is over, this is the Garden of Eden of Mexican food. Horchata is great, the homemade chips are great, the tortillas they serve to the side of every platter is incredible, the green sauce they serve in a bottle with your meal you can just drink this... just don't mix it with your horchata cause that is gross. 
I had a Chili Relleno my daughter had a Super Taco with shredded pork. I tasted both, and they both just about made me stand up and dance... DANCE! I am serious ;P This is a mixture of sit down dinner and fast food... I really couldn't change a thing about this place. Two days later, I brought my wife here with the rest of our kids, my wife and kids came to the same conclusion... this place is amazing. Come hungry, leave full, and you will probably have really good dreams afterward."}
{"text":"Good tasting burrito but pretty small for the price. Ordered the super and paid $8 for it, have to say I was very disappointed in what I got for $8. If this is the biggest burrito on the menu then I know I will not be back. It was half the size of Chipotle or even Roberto's and not even close in price. Nothing wrong with the product just disappointed in what I got for the price."}
{"text":"Best Chili Verde on this side of the Valley.  I always go for the full dinner plate but I've had the tacos and two of their burritos. Nothing disappoints and the staff are very friendly. Don't forget to score a bag of the fine pickled vegetables to go with your take out order!"}
{"text":"I love, love love there breakfast Steak burrito, with no beans!  It is very affordable."}
{"text":"I came here because it was close and the name enticed me. I ordered the \"super burrito\" out of curiosity and was disappointed to say the least. There is nothing super about this burrito. It's more expensive than faustos, robertos, and don tortaco with no substantial difference in size or quality. The tiny, thin pieces of steak also threw me off."}
{"text":"I ate here once... Probably won't repeat. 
I think the only thing that keeps this place alive is the fact that there is not many Mexican choices in the neighborhood other than the typical chains.   Reminds me of the old style gas stay ion burritos. I definitely was not impressed. I do not see the place lasting"}
{"text":"Amazing place. Stopped here for lunch today and we walked up to the register and was greeted by a very friendly gentleman who was more than happy to show me why this place is better than robertos. And after the food was ready he even served us! Food is great and itss a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"i love this place!! anytime im craving authentic mexican tacos and dont feel like driving all the way to northtown, i stop in here for the carnitas tacos w/salsa verde.  omggg they are really good!!! they are made w/2corn tortillas and the outside one is just a little crispy for some crunch.  they add in freshly made pinto beans and then the meat of course, w/cilantro onions n lime!!! pretty freakin good!!! the guy whos usually there is really cool too.  always hooks it up w/the grilled jalapeños for some exta heat!!! 

im sure everything else here is just as good, but thats all i ever get!!! XD"}
{"text":"Love the food here! This is what I've been looking for since the move from northern California (insert I dislike robertos). We had breakfast burritos: one bacon and one chorizo-both two thumbs up. Can't wait to return for super burrito goodness!"}
{"text":"We have been driving by Super B Burrito for several years. When I looked through my Entertainment book and saw a coupon, we thought we'd try it. We went to the counter to order, and were told that Super B Burrito was no longer honoring the Entertainment coupon out of the 2017 Las Vegas book. The gentleman at the counter was very nice and said that he would give us a 10% discount instead, and that the new management was not honoring the coupon. We politely told him \"no thank you\" and walked out. This is so short-sighted of a restaurant-- not to honor coupons. That's what brought us in there! I imagine most people would have simply ordered and paid the full price minus the 10%, but we left on general principle and will not return. If we would have liked Super B Burrito, we might have become \"regulars\" there, as it is pretty convenient to us. Now, they will never have our business. Was that really worth not honoring a lousy $6 coupon?"}
{"text":"Typical lunch stop for me. Something quick and easy. Their green salsa is different then Robertos or Don Tortaco, not as spicy but for sure flavorful. I typically get the burritos, they aren't too big, decent size. The place is very clean, the food choices are typical and the prices match other taco shops. They aren't my first choice for mexican food but they get the job done when I need something close to work"}
{"text":"Found this gem while visiting Vegas for a business trip. I was so impressed with the hospitality, cleanliness, and quality of the food . Anything passed the strip is so under recognized but being that I was so over the non authentic, overpriced Mexican food on the strip I decided to explore the surrounding city. This place was well worth the drive and I plan to visit next time I'm back in town ... don't miss out !!!! They have a ton of things on their menu !!! Thank u for the great service :)"}
{"text":"GROSS!!! I threw my burrito away it was so bad!! First understand I like two things from hole in the wall mexican places; bean and cheese burritos and nachos. Yup...that's my list. I know I'm not creative with my choices but what I like is the easiest thing to make so I rarely find a bad one. My fiancées friend goes on about how great this place is, so when the craving for nachos hit we went here. I didn't order the nachos because they put nachos cheese on it. I want real shredded greasy cheese, not Taco Bell crap. I ordered the bean and cheese and almost spit it out!! It was whole beans!! Not refried, not slightly mashed, not nothing!! They opened a can of beans, heated them, dumped them on with a slice or two of something they wanted me to believe was cheese, and kinda grilled the tortilla. I ate three bits and after dumping hot sause on it I finally just threw it away. Next time I'll stick to what I know is good; Roberto's!!"}
{"text":"Great inexpensive burritos.  Authentic tasting HUGE burritos.  The staff was very friendly, clean, and the food really good.  My son ordered the bean and cheese burrito with bacon.  He is quite a picky eater and he loved it.  The retried beans are made fresh and are really good.  Fresh chips and poco while you wait.  (And the wait is not long at all.  Worth driving a little out of your way to eat here!"}
{"text":"Service is always great at the drive thru, went in for the first time tonight.  I didn't get his name but the guy at the register was really nice.  He let my daughter try horchata for the first time - she loved it! My taco salad was perfect, my 14 yr old son devoured his tacos.  He came up for air long enough to say he thought the guacamole was just made & my daughters burrito was well, you guessed it - SUPER! This tired Mom is happy she made a good choice for dinner!  Thanks for cooking guys! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Just found out this burrito shop opened recently near my house, so I had to give them a try.  According to the manager, they've been open for about 6 months, and their thing is \"no fat\" meats.  My girlfriend and I got two chicken burritos... one super burrito (with sour cream, guac, etc.) and one regular one.  Both were very good, and definitely felt healthier than your other hole in the wall Mexican restaurants.  Unfortunately, they're only open til 9pm, so I probably won't be frequenting this place as much as I'd like to.  Definitely a nice friendly vibe here, though.  Recommended."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place.  The food is amazing and the staff is very friendly. I usually don't eat burritos but when I first tried it here I couldn't help but to finish it all. The price is amazing and the food even better. If you have ten chance you definitely have to give this plans a try."}
{"text":"Worst Mexican Restaurant in town. Where do I begin, 1st chicken enchiladas: not fresh at all, seems like they just rolled some chicken in a tortilla poured sauce over it and CUT a slice of cheese on top of it. Not even shredded cheese or even melted. Gross!! 2nd super nachos they poured can nacho cheese over like from a snack shack. 3rd: the rice was cold and salty. Once again not fresh at all. 4th  ( the the horchata : way to sweet . Well as you can see the list goes on. Very very disappointed and don't waste your time  NOT AUTHENTIC AT ALL!!"}
{"text":"Grew up in So Cal so I'm a big Bertos eater.  Super B is legit!  And their green sauce is off the hook."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service.  I went through the drive thru. Ordered a Super Burrito with Chicken.  The guy said with what. I repeated with chicken. I heard a click then waited 5 mins before a truck pulled behind me. I then said \"hello\".. Got no answer...then the guy started  literally whistling at me through the speaker. I then just drove off without my food. That's ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Oooh momma!
The flavor is strong with this one.
Clean, fast, friendly everytime. But not weird and sterile like Baja Fresh.
Glad they're open again!"}
{"text":"I'm tired, hungover, sore, and my ears are still ringing from the night before. What can get me out of bed? BURRITOS!

On our most recent trip to Vegas, my friends and I drove by this place on our way to Ralph's and saw their \"best dam steak super burrito\" sign and were immediately sucked in. 

I don't know about it being the BEST, but the steak burrito was juicy and decently sized. The chorizo breakfast burrito with beans was yummm. They're a little over priced in comparison to the cheap Mexican food in Los Angeles (you can check out a picture of their menu here on Yelp), but compared to the other food you can get in Vegas it isn't bad.

My only beef with this place was the wait. The second time we came here the wait was so long for them to TAKE our order at the drive-thru that we ended up parking and ordering instead. It took us 25 minutes to get the first of our 6 burritos (three separate orders). Turns out there was only one person working the entire place (on Memorial Day weekend!), but the wait should never be that long at a drive-thru taco stand. NEVER.

Also, there is no indoor seating -- there is only an outdoor seating area (no shade) by the street.

Because it's in Vegas, and because The Strip is lacking cheap Mexican food, I will probably come back, but if this place were in LA I would probably skip it."}
{"text":"Super B is kinda like a cross between Roberto's and Chipotle. The ingredients are higher-quality (like a Chipotle), but it seems more local and is frequented by actual Mexican people (like Roberto's). To add to the authenticity, the menu is in both Spanish and English, and they have Spanish music playing over the radio.
My hsuband and I both got the Super Burrito - his in carne asada, mine in chicken, and they were good. The Super Burrito comes with beans, meat, pico de gallo, guacamole, and sour cream. The meat was good, but the highlights for me were the fresh, chewy tortilla, and the pinto beans. They tasted like the ones your friend's nana would always be making in the kitchen back in middle school. (if you had friends like mine). Price was around $6.50 for a super burrito and a few chips. Note that despite the name, the burrito is not huge Chipotle size. 
Since they have notices about 'nor-cal's best' and other similar claims on the windows, I thought this might be a transplanted California chain, but best I can tell, Super B is unique to Vegas (don't quote me, my research is not extensive)."}
{"text":"Came in yesterday at lunchtime to try this place out. I pass it often and just never passed it at the right time to stop in and eat, so I made a point to eat here yesterday. 

When I got here the place was empty except for the workers, so after a quick look at the menu, my guest and I ordered. The menu is pretty large. They offer burritos, tacos, quesadillas, enchiladas plate, nachos, fries, bowls, Chile Relleno plate, fajita plate, tortas and more. Everything was very reasonable in price as well. 

I decided on the \"super\" vegetarian burrito which was filled with rice, beans, lettuce, pico de gallo, guacamole, cheese and sour cream. It was large and tasted delicious! I personally would have wanted some onion and more pico. I'll try and remember to ask for it next time. This burrito was $5.95, well worth the price. My guest got the San Fransisco burrito which was filled with fries, bacon, pico de gallo salsa, and choice of meat. all for $6.95. He said it reminded him of a California burrito. He said the meat was tender and they gave a good portion of meat as well. They offer two kinds of sauces for you to put on your food. A red which was my favorite. It wasn't spicy to me, just a little kick. And a green sauce. This one was not spicy at all. 

The inside was very clean with all tables wiped down and chairs put into their rightful places. The drink station was clean and filled with everything it was supposed to. 

The reason for my 3-star review instead of a 4 is because of the lady taking our order. She wasn't particularly mean or rude, but she kept on staring at me. I would smile and she would just give me a mean glare. She had no personality and huffed when I didn't leave a tip on the receipt. I really just don't understand why people work at a job where they have to deal with people if they aren't friendly."}
{"text":"Gross. This place gets nothing right... Carne asada was bland and tasteless, chicken was burned, tortillas tasted like they were bought at vons or albertsons (and were barely heated) and next time I want nachos with cheese wiz on them instead of REAL cheese, I'll go to the local 7-11... My wife is tossing this crap as I'm writing this. What a mistake to go here to give them a shot, best thing that came out of this is the idea that I never has to do it again."}
{"text":"A big plus for this place is that the BF is from San Francisco and this franchise is from the Bay area, so all the wall decor are pictures of the Golden Gate Bridge, Lombard St. ect... The BF felt proud....Oh Boy.....
Anyhow, the food I thought was good. I got Steak Quesadilla, the BF got a Super Burrito with rice & we got chips with salsa.
I hate rice in my burrito but if you want rice they'll put it in you just have to ask.
The steak was tender and marinated well & the Flour tortilla was made well. 
The BF did not care for his burrito much - he thought  they put too little rice. 
Now, the chips and salsa were hellah good!!! The salsa had a great flavor and it was a dry salsa. (I never knew just how much I love my salsa dry ) I'll forever seek out dry salsa's from now on...
The chips were hellah good as well - what a perfect crisp crunch and texture. 
The Green Sauce was salty/tangy good....
The inside is spacious and the guy behind the counter was quick.
All in all I wouldn't mind coming back- the BF said he'll just try something else next time.
I will be craving their chips and salsa shortly....."}
{"text":"The food was great and I left feeling fulfilled, I do like that they have tortilla chips accompanying the burrito, not sure if they do that with all the food that they serve.
I also like the face that they have napkin dispensers on the tables along with salt and pepper shakers. Yes some places call themselves a \"Taco Shop\" but it's still a full fledge restaurant....
They would have received 5 stars but the air conditioning was out and it was a little warm even though they had a evaporative cooler inside, maybe if it had water in it, would have been more bearable.

In my best terminator impression,
I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Got a Smothered burrito with chicken. For a green chile smothered burrito, it was not too bad. It comes with a few tortilla chips on the side. Nice touch. We also got an order of chicken taquitos. I wish we had skipped those. The chicken seemed dry, and they just tasted like grease. Not a fan of those at all. 

We have been here twice, and had the burrito both times. It is a good size, fairly tasty and the service was decent. The taquitos kind of ruined it for us, so it may be a little time before we return for the burrito a third time."}
{"text":"Best Chili Verde and best green sauce I have ever had. Also the best customer service. I came up short on my bill and they covered it without hesitation. When I came back a few days later to repay them, they said not to worry about it. The workers are always kind and very friendly. I have had other items on their menu and they are all equally good. I would recommend them to anyone looking for great fast Mexican food at a good price."}
{"text":"Went in yesterday at 4:30. The two men working were very nice and even split the burrito because me and my husband were sharing. Got the super burrito and believe its way better then lauritas! Definitely would stop by again."}
{"text":"Ordered the super burrito with carne asada, cheese enchiladas, and a super flour quesadilla.

Staff was friendly, and order was made pretty quick and accurate.

The burrito was SUPER SMALL for the price, and overall was average, the meat was seasoned not bland like some places.

The cheese enchiladas were pretty good, loved the sauce was really good. The rice was alright, and the beans were really bland, no flavor

The super quesadilla was also small, but was pretty fat, it was alright, nothing special

Overall, I pass this place all the time, but i mean unless i have a serious craving for cheese enchiladas i will continue to pass it by"}
{"text":"I got a carne asada burrito here a while back.  I don't remember much about it.  It couldn't have been too bad or too good then I guess.

This time around I got carne asada chips and a cheese quesadilla.  The prices were average.

The carne asada chips had nacho cheese instead of shredded cheese.  I'm not sure if I like that or not.  I was mostly just surprised by it.  The meat was fine.  There wasn't too much beans, which is a good thing.

The quesadilla was a big disappointment.  For paying nearly $3, I expected it to be about twice as big as it was.  The cheese they used wasn't cheddar, I think it was Monterrey jack.  I like Monterrey Jack, but once again it wasn't what I was expecting.  In any case there wasn't enough cheese anyways.

They really need to be telling their customers if they are going to do weird things like use nacho cheese or Monterrey jack.  Nobody should have to be surprised."}
{"text":"Very good food, relaxed atmosphere, very friendly employees! Delicious authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"THE BEST burrito I have ever had in my life. Friendly service and wonderful, that's what I'm talking about. the salsa  verde is to die for."}
{"text":"Its location refused to honor a two-for-one coupon I have from the Entertainment Book. They said they have never subscribed to this program even though I have used one in the past without any trouble. I have a coupon in my hand which I showed a picture of and even showed on the mobile site that they do under it. This location will not get any business turn away customers especially after I had them cook it already before they ask for payment. Very disappointed as I thought I was even lied to from the employee who told me they did not honor the coupon as I know for sure I have used it before. Customer service does go a long way. This location really doesn't care"}
{"text":"This would have got 5 stars if the last time my burrito wasn't so tasty.  Usually the $7 I pay for the Carna Asada burrito is worth it, but last time, it was off by a lot.  There was no seasoning and it tasted bland.  If they can consistantly make the burrito as good as the first 3 time I had it, it would be my favorite burrito in vegas!"}
{"text":"We've been here a few times. The food is cooked to order. The employees are friendly.  The wet burritos are delicious!"}
{"text":"Seriously delicious!! It reminds me of la street fairs. The food is really fresh and authentic. I got 3 roll tacos, which comes with green and red salsa, sour cream, guacamole, and pico de gallo. Definitely will be coming here often!

-update-

I just came here again to treat my parents! I paid just using my tip money from work, which was all in ones, but the woman at the register was perfectly fine with it and was extremly friendly. Our food came within 10 minutes, and the waitress even got my family water and our utensils! Like a couple of goofballs, we spilled the water, but the waitress was kind enough to clean it for us. No attitude at all!! The food was just delicious, and for now my super b cravings have subsided. I can't find any place that's as good!! Couldn't praise it enough :)"}
{"text":"The quality of their meat (not meet as it is spelled on their menu,  lol) is second to none, and they are not shy putting it on whatever you get either. Their cheese is top notch and they have the absolute best fountain Coca-Cola I have ever had, of all things. They are consistent, friendly, and not overly expensive. The place is clean, and other than the spelling errors on their menus both inside and out, this place is absolute perfection!"}
{"text":"This was just ok, BUT I did just have a breakfast burrito,  hard to judge a place on that. Average price.  They threw a few tortilla chips in probably as decoration as they were literally just a few, and a little stale.  The house made red salsa was good I'll give them that. I'd be interested in trying something else but only of I'm around,  today I'm here while I wait for my oil change next door."}
{"text":"Super B? More like \"skimpy b\"! Seriously, look at the photo. For $6 and change, I would think that the size would be a bit larger....Yeah, I get it, I'm a fatty, but for those of you who aren't, I'd imagine you would want a burrito large enough where you could split it with your favorite lady. I got the \"San Francisco\" burrito, which should have been called a San Diego or CA burrito (it was carne asada and fries). Secondly, if it were a \"San Francisco\" burrito (large burrito with rice and beans wrapped in foil), it should actually be called a \"mission\" burrito. I've never thought of myself as a burrito snob, but I've lived in CA most of my life, so it turns out I've been spoiled. The \"CA burrito\" itself was not bad tasting.....good enough that I left me wanting more."}
{"text":"This place is exactly what you would expect except from a random Hispanic fast food spot for a few differences. 

One thing, they do not have a bunch on the side vegetables that you would see at Roberto's. Another thing is that the food is better.

Today, I had the egg white burrito with chicken and avocado and pico de gallo. They used chicken thighs, which is awesome since it is way more flavorful than breast meat.

I really, really dig their green salsa. It isn't the watery stuff that I see at Roberto's or other places. Honestly, I didn't even really need the salsa. The burrito by itself was pretty spot on."}
{"text":"Had the super burrito, wet with chili verde on top and it was delicious!  Boyfriend had carne Asada and chorizo tacos and he enjoyed them also. Guys inside were very friendly also!"}
{"text":"I love this place, good cheap prices and super tasty food.  I love the little tacos and their quesadilla is fabulous.  Their red salsa is also very good."}
{"text":"All I'm going to say is Carne Asada topped with Chile Verde.  This combination can only be topped by Batman and Robin.  Bon Appetit'"}
{"text":"Mehhhh.... It wasn't terrible... but soggy beans, bland carne asada and uninspired pico certainly explains why this place is empty every time I drive by. Next time I'm in the area and hungry I'll just drive the extra 2 blocks and go to Del Taco. My search for a good hole in the wall Mexican place will continue on! It's to bad because I wanted to like this place..."}
{"text":"I grew up eating Chili verde burrito in California. I been driving by this place for awhile now and yesterday I decided to pay a visit. It brought back memories from me growing up and my dad taking me to lunch there. I miss it. Thank you."}
{"text":"This place is a delicious, cheap and clean local Mexican restaurant. I definitely recommend it to anyone who is trying to eat some good hole in the wall Mexican food!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing! I love to order the chicken quesadilla and the steak burrito which are equally as delicious as they are authentic. The male that is always working there that could also be the owner is an incredibly nice man that makes the best auga de melon! So refreshing and also made well just like everything else. I highly recommend this place to everyone and encourage everyone to try everything here as it's all delicious!!!"}
{"text":"First time here. The cashier offers me samples of the green Chile pork. WOW,that meat makes a mean burrito. I will be back!"}
{"text":"The worst lunch I've had in Vegas to date. Without question.

There's a guy standing out front holding a sign saying \"Upgrade your Mexican\" food. After I walked out I had a passing thought that someone should have done the public a favor and tossed a Mexican coke bottle at him to scare him off or something.

I ordered a Super Burrito with chicken, chips and pico with a side of guacamole, and they gave me a small cup of carne asada steak to try. I asked about the Lengua / Tongue on the menu but they guy kept steering me towards the carne asada for some reason. I also ordered some tamarindo to drink. 

The order was made fairly quickly but while I waited I looked around. I'm a little confused by this place. Is it a Mexican place? A San Francisco type place? The whole concept is confusing with Mexican food on the plate and pictures of the Bay Bridge on the wall. 

When the food was done I snapped a picture of it with the Yelp app. It looked good but that's where things went South in a hurry. The chicken burrito was flat. It's bad when a 7-11 microwave burrito has more taste than this handmade burrito did. And the carne asada steak? They need to go to Fausto's and learn how to make carne asada steak. And the guacamole? Heavy use of the salt shaker made it edible but it lacked flavor even with the heavy salt. How can one mess up guacamole? Talk about snatching defeat from the jaws of victory, this place found a way to mess up guac! The only things saving me from leaving with a growling stomach was the pico, the nothing special chips, and the tamarindo which honestly had me wishing I had ordered a Mexican Coke instead. 

On top of that the place just smelled weird. Not a cleaning chemical weird, or a backed up sewer weird, but definitely something was not right in there. 

I really regret going there. And while I will give places second chances this was bad enough that I don't think I'll go back. For the money I spent I could have had Chipotle. Super Burrito is like the anti-Chipotle. It's what Chipotle would be like if they did EVERYTHING wrong.

1 Star, but only because Yelp says you gotta leave 'em something."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place, I live 2 minutes away and the reviews are good..... It was not impressive. They forgot our steak quesadilla, I asked for sauce on the side mmmm nope. And the food was really just mediocre. Meat was okay, beans and rice were sub par, definitely skip the horchata.... Taco y taco is way better down the street."}
{"text":"Some of the best mex food in town. Los of flavor in the food unlike the boring stuff at Roberto's."}
{"text":"Count your change, and look at your receipt. I had been going regularly, and last week I was hungry, hurried and distracted. Later whenI looked at my receipt I saw I had been clearly shortchanged by the counter-lady. Doubt if I'll return. Or if I do, I'll bring the exact amount. Their burritos are only okay, the ingredients tend to be clumped at one end or the other. Who wants a big wad of guac at the end of the burrito? Anyway, the place reminded me of the cool burrito places I used to go to in SF Mission and I prefer to avoid big chains. Not sure where I'll go now."}
{"text":"SUPER FAST should be the name! NICE guy working the counter. decent chicken super burrito. next time I'll order pico OTS it made my burrito drip..I hate a drippy burrito."}
{"text":"Whoever gave this place 1 star must be a troll. This is a little restaurant that seats about 50 people. They let us sample all 3 meats, the chicken,  beef and pork before we placed our order at the counter. We got their beef burrito with pork on top and a couple of beef tacos. Both were great. 2 people can eat for 15 to 20 bucks and that includes drinks.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The spicy green sauce on pork tacos calls my name! The people are so nice and considerate everytime I eat here. Plus they're super clean. It's a great place for quick Mexican food..."}
{"text":"Really friendly staff.  Got the carne super burrito.. most places are greasy. This wasn't greasy at all."}
{"text":"I'm always on a lookout for new burrito places to try and since this place is close to where I live, I pass it often just not when I'm hungry! So this past weekend I decided to come here after spending the morning walking the strip. 

I came around lunchtime, but the place was empty. Not sure if it was because it was a Sunday and Mother's Day, but I was glad I didn't have to wait around to order. They have a good size menu so it was hard for me to decide but ultimately decided on the San Fransisco burrito. This burrito was huge!! I was hardly able to finish it and I can eat a lot!! The San Fransisco burrito is made of fries, bacon, pico, and a choice of another meat. I got the steak. Each burrito comes with a side of chips as well. No salsa bar, but they do offer a green and red sauce up at the front you can use. The red sauce was a bit spicy for me but the green was delicious.

The inside of the place was clean. Everything seemed in it's right place as well. For the most part, the people working there were friendly with the exception of the lady taking the order. She didn't seem to have any kind of a personality. Oh well. I can't wait to return and try something else!"}
{"text":"Aye Curumba!!! This place brings back the memories.

Back when I was a wee little lad, just started working, we would go and wait in line to get a huge burrito in Millbrae, CA. Home of the original Super Burrito store. I mean, this thing was huge, spicy and we would have to take a nap afterwards!

Fast forward to living in LV, I passed by this place several times and did not think it was the same as the California Chain. Then, I saw the signs, read up on this place on yelp and had to give it a shot!

1.  Location - Easy to get in and out of at a strip mall on the northeast corner of Pebble and Eastern.

2.  Ambiance - Clean and simple. Plenty of tables for eat in. You order at the counter. Signs of home sweet home SF and the Bridge! Yeah!

3.  Food - This is a cook to order place, so it is not like all the meat is in a warmer waiting for you, so timing wise, it will take a few minutes.

- Carne Asada Burrito 
- Chicken Burrito
- Carnitas Burrito
- Cheese Quesidilla

All above were pretty awesome. We ordered it as they prepare it, without the rice. Still very tasty.  Now this thing is not power packed like other places. No, it is wrapped nice and tight and has all the right amount of meat and stuff. This makes it easier to eat and to taste the meat.  All the meat was tender and juicy!

We have been getting used to the huge oversized burritos of late, however, the issue is that they fall apart and it is difficult to eat and enjoy it properly. We end up having to use fork an knife and to me that negates the experience and joy of eating a burrito with your hands!

Service was great and very welcoming. 

GK says this place is great and I am coming back."}
{"text":"The breakfast burritos are ok but their carne asada and beef tacos are bland. Very tough and chewy meat.  Their green hot sauce is a bit more flavorful than their red (pasty). The green sauce is their saving grace. 

I'm only coming here for their breakfast burritos from now on. Eggs, bacon and potatoes in a tortilla.  You can't go wrong with that.

I only use the drive through so I can't comment on the decor, bathroom ect."}
{"text":"This location Just opened  3weeks ago-so its clean and pristine.Its not popular yet so there is absolutely no wait for your food.The food was good,fresh and tasty.Will definately go back and bring my husband.Am also recommending it to all my friends.
Hope the location becomes a success,it could be a one stop place when you come home from out of town.Way to go super Burrito!"}
{"text":"Absolute WORST. Pretty hard to mess up a burrito. But they figured out how! Baffling how bad it is"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast burrito! Perfect size for me--I can never finish a burrito from anywhere. The staff is super friendly as well. They bring you your food and check on you to make sure everything is good."}
{"text":"Just ordered a Super Burrito with Chili verde, all I can say is it was bland beyond belief. It was the messiest thing I have ever eaten, full of watered down pico and guacamole. Will not be going there again."}
{"text":"Freakin delicious. The quality of the food is refreshingly outstanding. My girl and I had the SF burrito and 4 small tacos. The meat was juicy and the vegetables tasted fresh. The service was great. I recommend this to anyone who is tired of chipotle and Robertos."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this by accident, we were going to Z Chicken across the street not knowing that Z Chicken is closed on Tuesdays.  BF was hungry so we stopped here.  We both love Mexican food:  he is Hispanic, I lived in Mexico for over a year so especially he can be picky about the food.  I learned  how to cook chile rellenos in Mexico and mine are pretty good but the plate he got at Super B was almost as good as mine.  He loved it that the beans were not refried, they were whole pintos like frijoles de olla, and the 2 fat chiles were made with pasilla chiles.  I tried a bite and I liked them a lot!  I had a breakfast burrito with bacon and it was pretty darn good.  The salsas are made in house, the bf who drinks hot sauce like juice said the red was pretty spicy and the green I tried was flavorful but not spicy.  The food was plentiful, service was fantastic, lots of seating, very clean!!  We enjoyed our meal here and will definitely be coming back to try other dishes!!"}
{"text":"On a quest to find a good chorizo, egg and cheese breakfast burrito, I tried Super Burrito first because it is closest to my apartment. After getting it, I wondered why I couldn't smell the greatness that would be inside. It turned out they put whole pinto beans and potatoes inside and it kind of muted the flavor explosion of what chorizo would normally have. And where was the cheese? The red salsa was just too salty to eat. Sigh. I will have to continue my quest elsewhere."}
{"text":"Killer food and service. Clean establishment. Service was friendly and with a smile :)"}
{"text":"I ordered the wet burrito with red sauce and extra sour cream! I was very surprised about the taste of it. I will definitely order fe here again. I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 bcz the steak on the burrito wasn't carne asada like I expected but overall it was still pretty."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time with my sister last night around 630pm for dinner because we wanted a quick bite before heading home. We pulled up to the drive through which seemed like there was only 1 person running the food joint. My sister and I ordered a steak quesadilla that came with some tortilla chips, a San-Francisco burrito with steak & lastly a regular pork taco. Nothing was really \"super\" about it tbh. Around 10pm I started feeling sick, & next thing I know it I'm throwing up the food. Call it food poisoning, never eating here again. Disgusting!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Super B Burrito! This is what a true Mission District of San Francisco Burrito is supposed to taste like! Super Fresh, Super Delicious! I get a taste of home every time I eat at Super B."}
{"text":"Skip it and go to Cafe Rio down the road.  Seats needed cleaning off, it was really hot in there, staff wasn't too friendly, food is REALLY cheap though, chicken burrito was salty, salsa was dry. I don't need to go back."}
{"text":"This was my family's and I first time checking this place out. We're originally from the Bay Area (Northern California), and the window decal \"taste of the bay\" lured us in. The Carne Asada wet burrito was great, but the level of service for a small independently owned, family operated restaurant was beyond exceptional. The gentleman working the register made us feel right at home with his personable personality, and was quite courteous to anticipate our needs by bringing us a high chair for our little one. He was even so kind to provide us with a small side of complimentary beans for our young child, as he put in his words, \"don't worry about it it's for the kid...\" Definitely a breath of fresh air when it comes to service in small fast casual dining establishments. Great job Super B!"}
{"text":"Was looking for somewhere to eat with my bf and saw this place and decided to try it out. My bf loves burritos so it wasn't to hard to sell him on this new place. 

I personally loved my super burrito, so fresh and cooked just right. The guac was tasty and the salsa was not overpowering the flavor of the carne asada. I enjoyed the tortilla also, as it was not thick like store bought ones. You got a little side of chips with the burrito and wish I would order more, next time! They where real tortilla chips and not overcooked. Maybe try some nachos?! 

For a drink we both order some horchata. For us it was not very good, it had way to much cinnamon in it which just made it taste unappealing. Next time just go with a fountain drink. Also, that atmosphere was quiet and not very appealing to sit and eat in. I may just stop here on my lunch break and take it to go. 

Overall definitely a place to visit more often around work."}
{"text":"Very good burrito with quick service and clean restaurant.
Went twice so far and will be back.
Great prices for the portion size."}
{"text":"Food 3 stars
Fast food 

I've had San Francisco Mexican food and this isn't even close to the taste. I's Okay if you want a quick burrito, but stay away if you expect great flavor."}
{"text":"Any place with decent food and a 24 hour drive through is a-ok in my book.  The location is a bit difficult to access, since there is no u-turn at the Tropicana/Paradise light.  So, unless you are already heading East on Trop, or you decide to make an illegal turn (not recommended, cops feast on the area), you really have to go around the block to get to this place."}
{"text":"Food: Super B Burrito, no beans, add rice. I've had it with carne asada and also the pork chile verde. Both were just ok. Flavors didn't wow me. Maybe I need to add green sauce? The pork was super tender but too saucy for a burrito, so maybe that was my bad. 

Service: guy at the counter is always super friendly to me and service is fast for to-go orders. 

Ambiance: there's plenty of indoor seating and a mounted TV to entertain you while you wait. I wished they'd put the closed captioning on though. 

Location: right on Eastern so easy, but personally a bit of a trek for me and there are places closer. 

It's aight."}
{"text":"After fasting all morning,  I was STARVING!  I stopped in here because I had this place bookmarked on yelp(and also starving). Best decision ever!  They greeted me the moment I  walked in the door. 

They offer so much food and it's all customizable.  I ended up ordering the super burrito and a side of fries.   It's a lot of food for a decent price.   The super burrito had all my favorites in it,  asada beef, beans, pico, sour cream, and guacamole.  Absolutely delicious!  
I plan on coming back and trying some of their breakfast options"}
{"text":"First of all I will start with the positive.  The server/drive-thru attendant was pretty pleasant.  That's it.

The food itself was awful.  I had a chicken super burrito and the thing was a full step below taco bell.  The chicken was drenched in some sort of creamy goop and I couldn't tell what else was in the burrito.  Totally gross.

Go to Taco Bell if you want crappy mexican food and go here if you want to be even more disappointed. 

 I have begun to wonder about some of the review I see about this place and others.  Are people really this out of it to think this is 5 star food?  People must have really low standards or maybe just dumb in general."}
{"text":"Best burritos and tacos around here
 Im so glad I live right down the street. Best green sauce ever, chicken is good quality, not old or shredded. Wait time for food is a little longer, but worth it. 
 Best place ever!
I was devastated when you were closed for a short time."}
{"text":"I was here April 17th 2014, and I've had worse burritos and Mexican food in my travels, but this place was pretty freakin' good. I was here at 8am and was the first to eat.

Everything was clean, the food was served quickly, and I had plenty of salsa options. A foldable in the pocket menu was very helpful to me, but I ordered the burrito and ate away. A little spicy, but I also added their green sauce and believe me, it helped!

I would definitely go back and try it again, as Las Vegas seems to have not too many really decent Mexican food places to go to.

Good for fast food, if you need to, and great for dining, if you wanted to."}
{"text":"BEST burritos EVER!!!! Tried this place one day and haven't been able to stop going, I'm addicted!!! Everything is taste so fresh and their watermelon juice is amazing!! Nothing bad to say about this place at all from the customer services to the food no where compares. I actually have everyone in my office hooked on this place as well. I swear they recognize us when we come thru the drive thru because we eat here so much... it's almost embarrassing lol Thanks Super B's We love you! :-)"}
{"text":"Budgeting is tough.  My wife and I put our play money entitled \"Blow\" down to $100/month, and looking for a good place to eat is a very stressful decision - one that instinctively led to the place where a man held a poorly spelled sign (though I can't for the life of me remember what it was that made me laugh out loud and turn).

\"A good taqueria.\"  Pssht.  I may only be a gringo white boy (though I swear I'm one-eighth Mexican), I know and love Mexican food.  I've frequented the Roberto's, the Cafe Rio's, the Lindo Michocaon's - they've all been pretty good.  (Cafe Rio is bordering on American Mexican, but I digress.)

But I will put my money on Super Burrito over the rest for one reason - the meat.  I love the meat.  Their selections are both varied and excellent.  Marinated for hours and clearly seasoned to perfection, I was sold the second they let me test-drive their meats.  Wow.

Actually, I will put my money on Super Burrito over the rest for two reasons - the service.  The people there are friendly and it's clear that they want to do well here.  Smiles and cooperation makes this a solid mexican food joint to at least give a try.

I have a qualm - I have a feeling that they started in San Francisco - mainly because they have the weird decor of the Golden Gate, etc. adorning their walls, but I have to critique the way it's presented.  It's...  awkward.  And I don't know what it has to do with Mexican Food when there's no \"History of Super Burrito\" plaque or something to let me know I'm still, in fact, in Nevada.

Had their nachos and boy were they salty!  But I happen to like really salty nachos, so it worked out.  I've had the burritos.  I've had the taco salad, too, but the burrito is a solid way to start.  If you're not a vegetarian - which should be sacrilege in this restaurant if you ask me - you will love this place."}
{"text":"Had the wet burrito and I was pleasantly surprised. Not the largest burrito ever but it feed my wife and I.

Overall very good burrito i.m.o had they used homemade flour tortillas, added rice, added sour cream on top and used a tad bit less oil. 

Clean inside, great customer service, 

One other critique add sopes to the menu..."}
{"text":"A poster in the window says they're reopening on May 31.   Signs have been replaced and new banners posted."}
{"text":"Super Burrito should be Sorry Burrito.

We had always seen them around town with their van and had stated we wanted to try to the place. When they opened up the location on Tropicana it was definitely time to try it out.

It's a walk up/drive through location. So we walked up.

The staff was pretty friendly. The guy had asked if we had ate their before and after our answer of no, we were treated to some samples of their meat. 

I decided on carne asada super burrito and the man went with chicken super burrito. 

We waited in our car for our food and they were kind enough to bring it out the car for us. 

The man was anxious to try his food so he immediately went in the bag and kept pulling stuff out asking me what else I ordered and where was his burrito.

Much to our surprise, our burritos were there. Just not so super. They were flat, not round at all and filled with mostly filler. There was maybe 1 and 1/2 oz meat in each burrito. 

I had just spent a little over $30 on two burritos, a cheese quesadilla, drinks, and chips and salsa. Can I tell you how pissed off I was???????????

I will never try another Super Burrito in my life."}
{"text":"At first, I wasn't sure about this place.They wear blue shirts with the Superman logo and they don't have a large selection of Mexican food.
However, after trying a carne asada super burrito, I'm hooked. The beans are whole, not refried or mashed. The meat is very good without much fat or grease. The flavor of the burrito was excellant and it does not leave you feeling like you just ate a 1lb of lard.

I highly recommend this place if you are in the mood for a great burrito, nachos, or carne asada fries."}
{"text":"I was in the neighborhood and looking for a quick bite to eat for lunch. 

The good thing about this place is that they have a drive thru. Definitely a plus. I ordered the pollo verde burrito, minus the beans. The service was fast and my burrito was ready quickly. I liked that it was wrapped in foil, which makes it easier to east on the go.

The flavors were pretty good. I enjoyed the chile verde quite a bit. The flavors didn't blow me away, but it was tasty. I will definitely be back to try out the other burrito options that are also cheaper. The price added up pretty quickly, so $9 for lunch seemed a little steep. I saw some other burritos priced at just under $5, so I'll probably aim for one of those next time. 

Definitely a good option for a quick bite on the go."}
