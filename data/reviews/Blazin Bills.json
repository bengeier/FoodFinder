{"text":"I used to enjoy Blazin Bills.  But the last couple of times we have gone we got slow service, high prices an the food is lacking."}
{"text":"I use to live in Florida, and while I was there, I would frequent Sonny's Barbecue.  It's a southeastern chain with great pulled pork sandwiches.  I would order the \"Big Deal\", which included a pulled pork sandwich, fries, and a huge glass of sweet tea for $7.49.  So, I go into Blazin Bills to check out their pulled pork sandwich dinner, and was appalled that it was almost twice what I would pay for the same thing at Sonny's!!!  The sandwich wasn't near as good, either.  The ambiance was decent, but this place is too expensive for me.  :("}
{"text":"Believe it or not, this rural rib shack actually has a vegan burger on the menu. It was fantastic. Service was great. Beer was cold. I would return if I am in the area again."}
{"text":"We are frequent diners, but lately things have gone downhill. We ordered take out tonight. The ribs were fine, but the burger was dry as a bone, and the caesar salad was pathetic. so little lettuce, barely noticeable cheese and soggy croutons. We only live 5 minutes away and there were only 5 cars in lot, so they weren't too busy to do a good job. The last 2 times i have ordered the apple salad, they have failed to give the gorgonzola cheese. I think they need to step up there game or they will lose loyal customers."}
{"text":"Service was excellent... food was excellent and wife loved the pulled pork sandwich.  My sides were baked jalopeno and cole slaw. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I tell ya what, this place is on FIRE. ...twice actually. Yes, Blazin' Bills has gone up in flames twice. So the name does NOT disappoint.

But lets focus on the food, not the safety hazard, unless of course your idea of a good time at dinner is the faint possibility of using the emergency exits with your hands covered in sauce. 

In all seriousness, if the place did catch a 'Blaze' I'd probably at least finish my BBQ Jalapeños and then bolt for the door. What a great side dish! 

Known for their ribs, there are other kinds of food for different tastes, but lets face it, when it comes down to it, its a BBQ stop, not a vegan friendly chow down.

You won't leave hungry, and if you do, you did something wrong. Their flavor is lasting like the scorch marks on the walls. But don't be surprised when you go back that its 'temporary closed due to one of Bill's Big Blaze's' gone horribly wrong."}
{"text":"Blazin Bills never ceases to please. We love the ribs. The best we have ever had. We always order a full rack so we can bring home leftovers for the next day. They are meaty and fall off the bone. The King crab legs are amazing. Huge!  You can order one or two pound servings but one pound was plenty. They give you scissors to cut into the shell which makes it so much easier to get every morsel.  Our waitress was awesome (Nicolette). We had a party of 7 and the place was busy but we had great service. We will definitely be back again!  Prices are average for such good food and portions are ample. We always have to have a carry out container."}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic, great tasting BBQ, you have to go to Blazin Bills. It's a little bit of a drive to Troy Township, but you won't be disappointed. GREAT Baby Back Ribs, Pulled Pork and chicken. Also, don't over look the onion rings.

Blazin Bills - Don't pass this place up"}
{"text":"IMO for the price it's not worth it. 
I got the 1/2 rack with 1/4 chicken.
The ribs were un-meaty & the chicken was so small I almost couldn't find it on the plate. Baked potato could've been cooked a little longer too & baked beans were average to say the most.
One more thing the pop (coke) tasted like water. The server said it was caned pop but no fizz at all. So I asked for a sweet tea, no good either.
But our server was nice"}
{"text":"Very disappointed.., Took a group of five from Strongsville,Parma and Warren.No Beef Ribs(which is OK due to finding a new distributor)  when ordering,they bring you the baby back automatically..., Two of the girls wanted the Pork Ribs.and 50 cents more .Had to wait  at least 10 mins for the exchange.They ended up just taking them home.Fatty and tough.Also,one loaf of bread..Really? Waitress was way to busy for us.I was very embarrassed I suggesed it.,Usually fantastic..Not sure I'll be back,and I know they won't...Sorry"}
{"text":"Was invited here with a party of 8, I read the reviews on yelp and was a little worried . We'll  I have to say we had great meals ! Starting off: the Server was great and the bread was hot and fresh. We ordered the onion loaf and it was good comes with a nice horseradish sauce. We had both the baby backs and regular pork ribs both where very good. Note: these are not smoked ribs but ribs that you would have if you bbq in your back yard. Very meaty and and tender.  Sides : baked beans very good not your traditional but very nice flavor. Cole slaw: very good a little kick to it. Corn: outstanding being corn season here in Ohio. Read reviews of being overpriced ?? A full slab of ribs for 22 bucks with two sides ?? Geez if you bought a slab at the grocery store it  is 15 bucks before you cook it ! Sauces not bad either but I would kick up the hot bbq sauce just a notch. Overall I think a very good value and good food, will definitely stop in again if in the area !"}
{"text":"Had lunch there with 7 friends.  We had burgers, ribs, pulled pork, cheese fries and baked beans. All was great except baked beans were just average. The best was the pulled pork. Best I've ever had! Not cheap but very good."}
{"text":"Not the best.  I have driven past this place hundreds of times and it's always packed, so I had high expectations.  Measly portions, frozen fries, dry chicken, skimpy ribs...  Service was good though.  I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"Best ribs in Geauga County.  Service is always great.  I love going here whenever I get the chance."}
{"text":"Food's pretty good.  But I can boil meat too.  I rarely will pay someone to boil meat for me.  That's why I've only eaten there a couple of times.  

You have to give them credit though.  People pile in to this place to eat boiled meat.  The parking lot is always full.  Must be a lot of British folks in the area.  It reminds me of a Place in Scotland I ate at-  they claimed to have real Texas BBQ.  Very popular with the locals.  Turned out to be boiled eye of round and pita bread.  At least they got the beef part right.  They didn't try to pass off lamb as Texas BBQ.  Or even worse- pork.  Serving pork bbq in some counties in Texas will get you 30 days in the pillory.

Where's Blazin Bills BBQ smoker? Can't see it. Don't smell it.  Must be boiling the meat to tenderize it.  Then to the grill for grill marks.  

BoilBQ."}
{"text":"Great little BBQ joint out of the way on Route 422 good simple menu, food is always well prepared my favorites have always been the baby back ribs and chicken nice smoke favor and fully cooked and tender. The service has always been good. They do have a unique item I've always enjoyed as a starter smoked jalapeño peppers in  BBQ sauce you never know the heat range some are mild and some are extremely hot so it's a risk reward item but always very good. The place can get a little crowded and loud on the weekends but a friendly atmosphere lots of good memories here. I would recommend stopping in if your in the area and their open."}
{"text":"We waited almost an hour for our food and the food sucked! There's nothing good here. This isn't bbq!! My fish was soggy, the chicken was very dry and thin, the ribs were tough, and not to mention the prices are outrageous for what they give you. 
I DO NOT recommend this place. Save your money."}
{"text":"So when I first arrived (just recently), I started asking around for BBQ.  This place was mentioned several times.  From the descriptions, I was not expecting what we found.  This please is a bit larger and more formal then I expected.  

Once inside, we were met with a 'No Beef Ribs' sign, which was another downer.  So, oh well, keep soldering on.  So we sat down and started to look at the menu.  Lots of good stuff to pick from.  We focused on the Baby Back Ribs, side of beans and Baked Jalapenos.  Also got a side of fried Mac-n-cheese bites and onion rings.  Also, they do serve bread and butter to each table.

So from start to finish.  

Onion rings - golden delicious.  Large portion, hand cut and fresh.
Mac-n-cheese bites - hot and crispy.  They are a frozen product though.
Homemade Beans - disappointed.  Tasted caned and not very good.  Just lacked any real flavor.
Baked Jalapenos - this was interesting.  They are baked in the BBQ sauce.  They are baked with seeds in, so that makes them a bit spicier.  I liked'em.
Ribs - so I am from Texas, lived in GA for several years and have a pretty strong opinion of BBQ.  I also try to be flexible with my judgments.  So, they were fairly good.  I am not a huge fan of the sauce.  I was expecting something on the spicy side.  The ribs themselves were not great, but not bad.  They were not smoked which is a huge disappointment.  So I think they were boiled then baked.  This is an old trick and it is not something to be shocked about.  But, if you are going to be a BBQ joint, be a BBQ joint and pit in the time and the love.  

All of that being said, if you are not a spoiled BBQ nut like myself, still worth giving it a shot."}
{"text":"Good ribs and good BBQ.  Clean, and friendly.  Good choice of fries and sides.  Beans are delicious.  Can be busy resulting in slow food delivery, but worth the wait."}
{"text":"We ordered take out and were so excited because the food is usually great. My husband went to pick it up and they said their power was out and they could not take credit cards. He did not have cash on him so he offered to write a check...twice. They said no. No idea what they did with our entire order...NOT our fault the power went out..smart employees would have just given my husband the order. We used to eat at Blazin Bills a lot....guess what...they lost 2 great customers today. Bad bad bad customer service."}
{"text":"First the only appetizers worth getting is \"onion loaf\", \"wings\" or \"french onion soup\". Trust me, everything else is not worth the money. Entrees are hard to screw up. But hands down baby back ribs are #1. The ribs are always extremely tender and the sauce is very good. if you like a little heat, get the \"heatwave sauce\" that's my favorite. Service is very good and seems like they enjoy what they're doing. Also bartender has a nice heavy hand which always makes a fun night... Either way, a great place to get away and the only place in the area for BBQ."}
{"text":"We had a great time celebrating my Mother's birthday. The ribs were outstanding. The service effective and friendly."}
{"text":"Best ribs in the area. Always very consistent and fall off the bone. Hot sauce has great flavor but I'd call it a medium hot at best. Wife always gets the pulled pork and is very satisfied. It's a drive for us but we get there as much as we can."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and it's excellent BBQ. The first time, I got BBQ chicken and fries because I wasn't up for ribs. The chicken was juicy and it was two huge pieces. The second time, I did go for the half slab of ribs with a baked potato and the ribs were so good--fall off the bone, cooked perfectly, and seasoned to perfection. Baked potato was a perfect side kick. Nice, big place for a family dinner!"}
{"text":"Long wait (35 minutes) well worth it, Ribs were outstanding as were the sides, coleslaw was excellent, the service was excellent. Prices were a little high but in line with most other BBQ places, well worth the price."}
{"text":"We stopped here for appetizers on our way to the Apple Store on our way to Cleveland. It always looks busy and reviews from friends and Yelp have been positive. 

Our potatoes skins were excellent and the pickle pedals were also excellent. The would have been even better if they were freshly done and not just warmed up out of a bag. We also got jalapeño poppers that were mild with a tasty horse radish. 

Looking forward to trying this location again."}
{"text":"I wish we could give half stars. Wasn't really a four but better than a three. 

Three rib dinners. Everything was fresh and hot. The bake beans are unique and worth a try.  Corn on the cob is good too. Ribs were good but I wouldn't rate them blue ribbon. 

Place was packed with many 6+ tables yet food came out hot and quick. Kudos for service."}
{"text":"4.5!!

If you want good bbq in northeast ohio, please come here (only after kayaking, climbing nelson's ledges or swimming in nelson's quarry). This place had ribs that just fell off the bone!

I had the 1/3 ribs 1/4 chicken deal. The chicken was overcooked so I saved space in my stomach for the ribs and took the rest home as toppings for my salad. (I ended up eating the chicken the next day for breakfast.) The ribs were a definite WIN. The cajun fries and sweet potato fries are also very tasty.

Great comfort food after a good day outdoors!"}
{"text":"Three stars because the service was top notch and friendly. The food, however was another story. 
Isn't it time to stop calling any food covered in sweet sauce  \"BBQ\"? Shouldn't BBQ mean there was some smoke involved in a slow cooking process? Unfortunately the only thing that seemed to have been smoked was the pulled pork. It tasted just fine. If you can do that, why can't you put the ribs and the chicken in there, too? I can boil ribs at home and throw some KC Masterpiece on them and they would have been just as good. I can't vouch for the rest of the menu, but I would be reluctant to order any seafood here, especially not at the prices they charged (or didn't mention except as \"market price\"). I thought everything was a little over priced for less than memorable food. We did like the jalapeno poppers with their horseradish sauce and the baked beans and coleslaw were quite nice. But good sides and appetizers aren't going to save mediocre entrees.
 You won't leave here hungry and nothing was terrible but I'm not going to drive from the west side for so-so food."}
{"text":"Have been here some time ago but now that we have relocated to Geauga County we tried Blazin Bill's again. So glad we did it was great and we found a delicious wing place. The wings are fried and then grilled a bit with various sauces. The garlic and regular sauces were quite flavorful and very juicy. The hottest sauce was perfect, gets your attention with good pepper flavor but does not kill your taste buds with oily pepper sauce. And certainly not just Frank's hot sauce to call it hot. The waitress was great at the bar and the atmosphere was laid back. There is a bar side with tables and the other half is family style eating with tables and such. Outside eating looked nice but we were in heaven with a cold draft ( normal taps but some craft in bottles) and delicious unique spiced wings. We are craving them already and it's only been a week!!"}
{"text":"We ordered the onion appetizer it was huge, and it came out hit and fresh and taste delicious. Ordered ribs and chicken as the entrée. I was impressed with the ribs and chicken and liked the fact they gave us extra bbq sauce. Overall I would eat here again it may not be my first choice for BBQ but delivers a good meal."}
{"text":"We tried eat at Blazin bills today however the wait we had 45 minutes took an hour to wait a for our food to arrive. The place was so noisy and crowded. We ordered onion rings which were nice and served hoever very greasy. We all ordered ribs which was and nicely served and plenty of meat. After we ate it took the waitress another 40 minutes to give us our check never offer dessert or coffee. But the place is packed.the bathroom was a mess.upon leaving a lady at the register complaining that a take out order called in took another 40 minutes."}
{"text":"Fantastic food ..all of it is amazing! Impeccable service..laid back atmosphere.. Excellent patio with waterfalls!!! A Geauga county landmark must!"}
{"text":"I will start by saying nothing was not edible and nothing was technically \"Bad\"  I do not think this place would be around if not for the fact it is the only place in the area to eat BBQ that I know of. The food portions were small for the price points so basically charging more for less. the quality of the food was really nothing great it was all cooked properly but was lacking in flavor and Quality. way to much fat on the ribs and the sauce is just ok as they use open pit and add stuff to it. I would not Go back or ever tell someone \"oh you gotta try this place\" that is for sure"}
{"text":"We try to drive out here once every couple weeks. The ribs are always the best ribs I've ever had. Love the coleslaw and baked beans. Service varies, but we have had good service more times than not. It's not far for us, but worth the drive on a beautiful, sunny day. You can sit outside as well. We go early, otherwise be prepared to wait!"}
{"text":"Ohio sweet corn. 
Yummo!

Their ribs were tender and delicious. The bread, yeasty. (that's a good thing.)



That's it. That does it for me!"}
{"text":"I agree with the other users who said, \"I have no idea why this place got good reviews\". We decided that based on those GREAT reviews we would ignore the few bad ones and try it out, but I wish we hadn't.  We got bacon and cheddar fries, which weren't anything special, it would be pretty hard to mess those up. My boyfriend and I shared 1/3 slab of ribs, shrimp skewer, and ordered some BBQ chicken. This was not real BBQ and I feel bad that those who rated this highly have clearly missed out on ACTUALLY good BBQ. The ribs were moist, but not smokey, or anything. Boiled in water and pour a ton of BBQ sauce on it is how they tasted. The shrimp was so bad. I had thought they'd be grilled considering they were on skewers but they were limp, frozen shrimp you could find in the freezer aisle at Wal-mart, they honestly tasted microwaved. No seasoning or anything! The chicken was TERRIBLE. Burnt and dry then (again) poured a ton of BBQ sauce on it to cover it up. WAY too overpriced for the quality of food we got. I will not be returning, nor recommending this place to anyone."}
{"text":"We were here mid-afternoon on Saturday. Our waitress was excellent. My husband loved the beef-ribs. My chicken was as ordered and okay. The kitchen was another story. 

The Gordon Ramsey wanna-be in the kitchen screaming about a toaster loudly and clanging pans should be fired. He totally ruined our experience. 

In addition to the fireworks in the kitchen, the plastic wrap in the applesauce was the icing on the cake. I will say that the waitress made the plastic in the food right by taking the meal off the check without our asking. 

All in all, I doubt that we will be back. We will stay in Cleveland or go to Oak and Embers in Chesterland."}
{"text":"This place is way overrated. Nothing special about the sauce. And the fried pickle app was no more than one pickle and cost 5.50!! I definitely didn't get my money's worth. Needless to say, I won't be back and won't be recommending this place to anyone."}
{"text":"We met out a blazing bills on a Friday night for eight of us for dinner about 8. Now I know this was in the middle of Burton and some people would call that the middle of nowhere but I thought it was a pretty cool place for being smack dab in the middle of nowhere. The bartender was very attentive and in a way I kind of wish we could have spent more time at the bar because we are having a good time talking with the locals and the bartender.

Our server was polite and attentive and we really did not want for anything as our drinks were filled quickly. I ended up ordering a pulled pork sandwich and fries and for some reason I thought this was a barbecue joint I don't know where that got into my head but if they ever decide to take up barbecue they've got a pretty good start with this pulled pork sandwich. My buddy got a slab of ribs and Fries to which he promptly demolished and said the meat fell off the bone and he could not have been happier.

It was kind of odd that on a Friday night to places near empty but that is to my benefit I guess. I don't like to get 5 stars off the bat without giving it a second chance so I'll leave it at 4 and give him another try and see if they can go for the home run. My only real complaint is that it could use an a refresher in the decorating Department."}
{"text":"Blazin' Bills. I'm not really quite sure how to say this without it coming out weird. I've been there a number of times and while it's not blow-your-mind good, it is definitely the best food you can get around Hiram. 

Went there with a couple of friends from college and we had a great time. Didn't quite know what to expect from the 'onion loaf,' but we got this gorgeous mound of fried onions (we only got the half order, and the 4 of us had a hard time finishing it) with this very bizarre thing called 'Tiger Sauce.' Now. When a place out in BFE starts putting strange names on white sauces, I get a little nervous. However, it's basically mayo with horseradish and with the fried onions, it was tasty.

Then hilarity ensued. Menu says that fresh bread comes with the meals. Fresh bread, apparently in Troy Township, means a hoagie bun. An honest to G-d hoagie bun, mechanical slice down the middle and all. With a knife in it. Ya know, to make it classy.

But. I didn't go to BBs for bread. I went for the ribs. And oh, what ribs they are. Delicious and tender, I could eat them for days if you were so inclined to foot the bill and wheel me to and from the bathroom in a wheelbarrow.

So. If you're stuck in the middle of BFE and need a decent meal, definitely recommend BBs. Get the ribs. Stay away from the hoagie bun."}
{"text":"Absolutely great food!! The onion loaf is my favorite appetizer. I usually get the southwest chicken sandwich with the sweet potato fries. It's delicious! Their ribs are fall off the bone amazing every single time! I have been coming here for years and it's worth the drive! The inside is always clean and the waitresses are always friendly!"}
{"text":"We are from Detroit and have a few excellent and very authentic BBQ restaurants. Drive past here a few times a year and stopped by today. 

Service: just ok. Friendly, but inefficient. 

Time for food:  AWFUL!!!  We were here at 1:30 pm and the restaurant was pretty empty. Ordered 2 pulled pork sandwiches. Took 30 minutes for foot to arrive. About 20 minutes into wait had to flag down waitress to ask about status. Was told kitchen takes a long time to serve 1st pulled pork dish of the day because they had to make it. So we expected very moist freshly pulled pork. 

Food: after half hour wait, pulled pork sandwiches arrived. Meat was room temp. Plus meat was dry, hard, and over sauced. Pork was not hand pulled, but rather chopped. Sauce is not the best. Hot sauce is barely spicy.  

Overall:  just not good."}
{"text":"Great food.  Service was super.  Super nice to our kids.  The food was great.  Had pulled pork sandwich - yum.  Husband had ribs.  Good beer and wine selection."}
{"text":"A decent place for BBQ and convenient to get to (right on 422).  Usual BBQ fare (slabs of ribs, chicken,  etc.)"}
{"text":"We had a great time, met local people and the staff was very friendly,
We had the ribs and fish, the food was good and the onion rings were the best I've ever had, would return! Awesome food and even better service."}
{"text":"It was fine...been there plenty and know the quality of the burgers isn't exactly B' Spot grade but still delish...FF also hot and yum!
Date had the pulled pork sammich and she killed it...But she is an eater like me so I kept my fingers away from the moving parts...
They DO need more tap beers tho'"}
{"text":"My mom had an insatiable craving for beef ribs (my parents keep \"kosher\" so no pork rib could work), so we treked out from our suburb and have no regrets whatsoever.

Service was friendly, however a little slow for a Sunday afternoon. It was actually pretty surprising how packed Blazin' Bills was for 3 pm on a Sunday.

We ordered beef ribs and an onion loaf. The onion loaf was delicious...however I'm not sure why it wasn't just called \"onion rings,\" because our \"loaf\" was just a plate piled high with onion rings. The ribs were incredible. They had clearly been smoked for a substantial length of time, which yielded fall of the bone meat. Their sauce was a very pleasant mix of sweetness, spice and vinegar. 

Well done, Blazin' Bill (if such a man exists)."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Great vibes.  Great bartenders,  great good.  You don't want nor need anything more"}
{"text":"Wanted some decent BBQ while in town visiting Grandpa and the pulled porn sandwich hit the spot! Prices for the sandwiches and entrees were acceptable - about $13 for a decent sized pulled pork sandwich with fries, a small cup of Cole slaw, and pickle. Disappointed / surprised with the $7 House Salad that really was the equivalent of a $3.99 (or less) add-on at other places. Service was decent for a Friday night and the atmosphere was okay, not too loud. My husband and I were put at a table that got draughts from the front door and was awkwardly placed between the area behind the hostess station and a large fireplace. We didn't bother asking for a different table because the booths looked pretty full."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely delicious!  I loved the ribs and my kids couldn't get enough of them.  The Mac and cheese bites weren't very good but the onion loaf was perfectly crispy."}
{"text":"Best BBQ around!!! I don't understand how this place is anything less than a 4.5.  I've been going here for years and they have always been consistently great!"}
{"text":"This place came highly recommend by one of its local patrons, and I was extremely excited to check it out.  I love BBQ along with Mom and Pop restaurants, so I was thinking this place was going to be a home run.  However, my experience was anything but a home run.  Two friends and I went there last Friday before a high school football game.  We were in a bit of a time crunch so we all ordered the pulled pork sandwich and French fries.  At most BBQ restaurants, this comes out in a matter of minutes, but it took closer to 45-50 minutes for it to arrive.  Not to mention, our server seemed to be MIA.  If it wasn't for flagging down another server, we wouldn't even have received a refill of our drinks. It was also aggravating watching people, who arrived after us, receiving their food.  Our server only had three other tables she was waiting on, which seemed to receive equal neglect.  So in a nutshell, we had terrible service.

I have been known to go back to a restaurant with bad service if the food is great.  This was not the case.  The pulled pork was so dry; we had to drown it in sauce just to make it edible.  It really tasted like it had been prepared several days in advance, and had the consistency of shredded wheat.  In my opinion, any decent BBQ place needs to make two dishes extremely well.  One being pulled pork and the other being beef brisket (which was not on the menu).  If they cannot do these well, I will not even try their other items.  

Overall it was a terrible experience, and I would never go back."}
{"text":"I was completely excited about a new barbeque restaurant to try.  What a waste of energy.  I got the pulled pork sandwich.  It was dry and completely drenched in a sauce I didn't like.  I didn't have a option to change it.  My husband got the ribs and said that the local pizza guys are better ribs.  That's not good.  We also had the onion loaf and that had no flavor what so ever.  We won't be returning."}
{"text":"We have eaten here a ton of times over the years.  We love eating here.  Go during the week or early on weekend to avoid crowds.  They have a nice outdoor patio, but the service can b a bit slower out there. 

Food lowdown:
Apps- gotta get their onion loaf!  It used to be onion rings packed together to form a \"loaf\", now it's just a plate of onion rings, but they r the best u will ever have!  Fresh!  
Ask for their BBQ sauce and dip them in! Mmmm...a half loaf feeds 4 easy.

Free bread - I think they use Orlando bread co... We love the bread! 

Babyback ribs- fall off the bone, meaty goodness!! Now, I did get them once and they were charred too much and made the meat taste bad.  They made me new ones with no problem.  Add extra BBQ! Mmmmm

Chicken pasta- don't do it. Sorry, but it has no taste.  Get what they r good at.  It's a rib (BBQ) place not a pasta place.  

Sides- their salads and ranch dressing are good!  Corn on the cob (in season only!) is fresh not frozen.  Loaded baked potato, mmmmmm!  Oh, and I LOVE the coleslaw here!!! Butter a slice of bread, then pile on some coleslaw....oh yeah baby!  The only way to eat it there!!! Ha! 

They serve beer in a frozen frosty mug... So if your not into that, let them know... I like it that way, my hubby doesn't.   

Pricy place, but worth it in my book."}
{"text":"Best ribs in town and pulled pork in town. I love going here because it's a great environment and friendly employees. Visit here if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"Do not get the Pork Lover's Combo (pulled pork was sad all around... chewy, modest amount). DO GET THE FULL SLAB! Also... Heat Wave sauce! Seriously... are you a fan of heat? Get that.

Blazin' Bills servers? Beautiful, charming, concerned and attentive. 

Ribs lover? Go there ASAP!"}
{"text":"Went here with my family for dinner. Was disappointed. The service was good however the food was not worth the price. Decided to have the onion loaf for an app. not a good idea it was loaded with grease. I was looking to order BBQ however there wasn't many options of the menu. Either ribs or chicken. I am more of a beef brisket  or pulled pork person. Anyway I ordered the southwest boneless chicken breasts. They were ok but the cole slaw and cajun fries that came with it was not very good. My friend ordered a rib and chicken combo dinner and he too was disappointed in the taste.  Will not be returning"}
{"text":"Solid bbq spot that seems like it's in the middle of nowhere. But it's awesome. Definitely try the pulled pork sandwich and lather it in sauce. Truly a great bbq spot!!"}
{"text":"The BEST BBQ ribs and chicken! I love their sauce! I haven't found another rib place that can compete. Our favorite waitress is Donna. She's the best! We've been coming here for years. I ALWAYS look forward to going here. Nice atmosphere and great food."}
{"text":"Got ribs and chicken combo to go.
Ribs had very minimal meat on them. Even for ribs!  Chicken was bland.  The BBQ sauce was SUPER thick and sweet.  It tasted like cheap supermarket sauce.  Thoroughly unimpressed."}
{"text":"I was extremely  disappointed  at Blazin Bills I didn't even consider it true BBQ. The horrible experience stated out with what tasted like oily soaked pickle chips that tasted like they were frozen and freezer burnt at one time. The waitress brought out bread that tasted and crumbled like it was a day old purchase. Then I got the rib and chicken combo. The ribs taste like they were boiled then finished on a grill to burn the outside the chicken was small and bland not enough sauce on either piece of meat.
Not overpriced for good BBQ but extremely overpriced for this place."}
{"text":"Good experience overall. Love the patio! 
Food: Ray's wing were the best thing we ate. I highly recommend them for sure. The ribs were broiled.  I much prefer them on the grill. Chicken breast was just okay. 
Sides: recommend cole slaw and baked potatoes. Baked beans  were a little too sweet for me. Loved the BBQ sauce."}
{"text":"No matter how hard they try no one touches this place in NE Ohio! Ribs are incredible, chicken is spot on and service is always tip top."}
{"text":"Finally stopped by to try the ribs. Got the pulled pork which was sooooo good. Ribs looked and smelled delicious so took those home. Had the chicken raisin salad. Large portion was good. The veggie bean burger on a toasted bun was delicious. Best was the corned beef on rye. Good portion of meat. Fresh bread. Yum! Sides:  large heap of cole slaw and crock of baked beans were very good. Sweet potato fries didn't have any flavor. Onion ring loaf was a pile of yummy onions. Would have liked to seen the loaf.  The venue is newer with lots of room. Bar is in a separate room with booths. Opened for dinner only during the week 5-9. Saturdays 12-10. Check Sundays hours. Nice to have Blazin' Bills on our east side."}
{"text":"Food was tasty. Atmosphere was nice. Prices were a little high for what you get. The menu is primarily ribs and chicken. Not done in a smoker like true BBQ. Wouldn't go out of my way to go back."}
{"text":"Some of the best ribs I've ever had took my wife here for our 3rd anniversary. i checked out the crab and ribs combo prices are market prices they wanted 47 a pound of king crab legs wasn't worth it unless it's a very special occasion maybe for 20th anaversery lol But everything else was fantastic. The sauce for the ribs was pretty good it was a bit pricey though."}
