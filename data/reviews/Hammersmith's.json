{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Saturday afternoon. It was busy. By the time we were finishing our meal, there wasn't a table available.   Great vibe. Bad ventilation. You and your clothes WILL smell of food. It's especially bad when they are frying potatoes.  It's pretty bad.  I had the salmon dish and a peach lemonade. It was good, but way too expensive for the portion size. Food quality was good though. My salmon dish was $13 & my lemonade was $3.50. I think that's a little much.  My boyfriend had the chicken salad sandwich. He said it was quite tasty & high quality, but small portion and again, way overpriced.   I want to support this place because live in the area, but it's a little pricey for me to be a regularly-visited place.   Servers and staff are nice. People that come here seem pretty cool."}
{"text":"This little nook restaurant is right around the corner from where I live.  I wanted to try it twice before I reviewed it.  The first time was when they first opened.  There was some visible tension between the wait staff and things seemed a bit choppy.  It was a much different experience this time around.  It has been great to see the restaurant grow and change (I get off the street car there everyday).    Yes, the menu is simple, but that is the point.   The coffee is amazing and that is truly to notch for me!  The food:  I had the cured salmon and goat cheese omelet.  I was surprised that these two were put together, but over all it was delicious.  The omelet was fluffy and there was a good ratio of egg:toppings.   I thought it could use some chives or herbs to bring the plate together.   My partner had the bacon and mushroom omlet.  It was salty, but man, delicious.   The salad was over dressed with their white balsamic dressing.   It was very fresh and light.  I love salad for breakie, so I was glad to see it as part of the plate.  I am not sure why brunch had to be 45 for 2.  It certainly was just a one off event - we were lazy and didn't want to travel far for brunch or face scary lines along the Queen Brunch Buffet of Restos.   Overall, I love what they are doing for the neighborhood, their clear attention to quality and seasonal products and wonderful customer service.    They have odd hours which I think might influence the pricing - just because you don't care to be open for long hours, doesn't mean that you should up your prices.  Or, maybe, I just don't understand economics.  Help a sister out, hipsters?"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times for brunch and it's always been just the ticket! The coffee is exceptional and the atmosphere is wonderful. If you get the chance, try the duck confit hash. Absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"I went to Hammersmith's on a Sunday morning a couple weeks ago.  It was very busy and so we decided to sit at the bar they have, right beside the open kitchen.   My husband and I went hoping for the bacon hash, but because they have a blackboard menu, the bacon hash wasn't available that day. We went with the bacon omelette instead.   The food itself was boring. Our omelette was just bacon and cheese, no flavour. It was very disappointing. The salad that came with it was quite good, but not worth the money we spent. It was I think $11? And our tiny glass of lemonade was $3.50. But it wasn't even the food that was the biggest turn-off.   As we sat drinking our juice we had the opportunity to observe the cook and the servers interact. The servers seemed miserable as they were serving tables around us. From listening to the cook speak to them, it was obvious why. He was condescending, rude, and frankly, quite mean to them. It made the atmosphere of the restaurant very uncomfortable.   At one point the table behind us complained because everyone around them who came in after them already had their food, and they didn't! They had the right to complain about this as they were in the restaurant before we were and we had our food before them. They had to leave without eating and as they left the cook yelled after them, \"Thanks very much, ladies. Hope to see you again soon!\" in an extremely sarcastic tone. It was unbelievable. And it was the cook's fault as he was the only person cooking and decided to make every omelette at the same time instead of making orders as they came to him. Or at least, that's what it looked like to us. I worked in the restaurant industry for 15 years and if you upset a customer, you do anything you can to make sure they leave happy, because you know they're going to tell everyone they know not to go to your restaurant if they leave angry and upset.  So that's what I'm doing, as I left dissatisfied and disappointed. Skip Hammersmith's."}
{"text":"This is a nice little neighbourhood spot. I liked the slightly eclectic feel and the service was very polite. I had the impression that the owners take a lot of care in their dishes.  We went for brunch and both had the bacon omelettes and coffee. The omelettes were decently done, but nothing special. The side salad had a very nice dressing that I would go back for. The coffee was nothing to complain about! We didn't wait very long for our food and were not hurried out as we enjoyed our coffees slowly.  The price point felt a bit high (about $11 for the dish), considering that we make something similar at home most weekends and the area in general is more geared toward under $10 per dish.  We would come back for coffee and one of those gigantic and delicious-looking cookies on the front counter!  I'd also like to try the dinner menu, a prix fixe at $35. As I said, it's a nice little neighbourhood place, and I would like to see it grow and succeed. However, the pricing seems a tad high in comparison to the rest of the neighbourhood and just what we are getting."}
{"text":"Hammersmith catered our wedding in August, and they did a spectacular job.  They were excellent during every part of the process, and we could not have been happier with the result.  We had decided on a brunch wedding before we first consulted with them.  They were able to help us narrow down our options, give suggestions, and improve on our vague ideas.  They were extremely helpful in letting us know what would and wouldn't work, while fulfilling nearly all of our wish-list.  We had scones with fresh jam, granola, salads, french toast, sausages, juice, coffee, watermelon, and cake.  The food was exactly what we wanted - fresh, summery, flavourful, and our guests were very happy.  In addition, they did an excellent job at the wedding venue, which was very small and not really suited for catering.  They were so organized, everything was beautifully arranged, and the brunch was problem-free.  We can't recommend them, and the Hammersmith caf√©, any more highly!"}
{"text":"How does this place manage to stay open?  Their hours seem so random, the seating capacity is limited, and the food is mediocre at best.  The negatives: - Already mentioned above and; - Slightly Overpriced - Slow service - Service staff is blah  The pros: - Location  I don't know why the stayed from the good ol' Logan Grill.  That place was great and I had such high expectations for Hammersmith's.  It could be so much more than what it is.  For breakfast, Mad Dog's is a far better option, better menu, better prices, friendly staff, outdoor seating too, great coffee."}
{"text":"Where to start. I want to love this place, and I hope on round two that happens.  It's in the neighborhood, it's funky and totally what's needed in the area, great pedigree from the chef, and friendly people   The food was great, no question. I had a beautifully cooked  duck egg and confit hash, that was truly a cut above, but, tiny portion, I mean tiny, and crazy expensive at $12 dollars. I ended up having to stop for a snack about 20 mins later. My girlfriend had a beautiful omelette, begrudgingly, as the menu is freakishly limited to meat and eggs. So don't take someone here who wants anything from the other 90% of breakfast offerings typically available. Especially since they only do brunch, you'd think they would be on the pulse.   The lemonade was ridiculous, so tasty, and tart. I had a cookie to go, and it might have been the best cookie I have eaten ever.   So it's a mixed bag for me."}
{"text":"I was expecting much more based on reviews I've read across the web. my salmon and feta cheese omelette was good, but the bacon and cheese omelette (my partner ate) was too salty.  The bacon hash was visibly burnt -- I only ate a few bites.  The salad was delicious but my overall impression had me leaving knowing  I probably won't return.  The place was full - but not overly busy as it is a tiny place - but we still waited over 45 minutes for our omelettes (as one other poster mentioned, he cooked everyone's at the same time??!!).  They kindly gave us  scones at the end of our brunch, but by then we were too rushed to enjoy them.  Service was wonderful and their coffee good."}
{"text":"I live right on Logan, so this place is a brisk minute's walk from me. I've been here several times, and enjoyed it each time. Off the beaten track (it's neighbors are the Beer Store and an abandoned convenience store), it's a gem of a  breakfast spot. The food is always fresh and takes a while to prepare (a good thing imho). All the ingredients are fresh, the food is made in an open kitchen, the decor is bright and airy, and the staff are friendly and attractive. It can get a bit busy because it's not very big. Just have a seat at the bar and wait over a french pressed coffee."}
{"text":"Went here for a hangover brunch without knowing much about it. Service was slow, but friendly. Had the cured salmon and goats cheese omelette, which was very nice but needed... Something. My friends had the duck plate, the chicken salad sandwich and the smoked bacon omelette, and everything was pretty good. Loved the salad dressing. The \"kitchen\" is great, just a guy right there preparing everything on a small stove, so the wait was understandable. Coffee and water were replenished often and promptly.  They need to do something about the menu, which is just a chalkboard awkwardly placed on the wall. I saw people getting up to try and read it and having to stand in the way of server. Over all the food was good, but not amazing, the service was slow, but friendly, and everything was a little over priced. Probably wont go there again."}
{"text":"A small menu, but they certainly do they make their selection well.  I had the duck plate $13 which included duck hash, a fried duck egg and some baguette for dipping. They didn't ask how I wanted my egg prepared which I found unusual. It was served sunny side up, but was well prepared without any browning of the white.  The duck has had just a little bit of preserved cabbage which cuts the duck fat nicely.  Everything is prepared in an open kitchen which gives the restaurant a nice homey feel.  My guest enjoyed the French toast with wild blueberry compote, bacon fig jam and strips of bacon. The bacon is smoked, cured bacon which, if you've never had it, is what bacon is supposed to be. Most bacon you would purchase from a grocery store is supersaturated with a salt-water solution which is why it is so wet and drippy when you purchase it. This super-saturation increases the selling weight of the bacon so they can say they are giving you more bacon than they really are. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/food/article-1350926/Supermarket-bacon-pumped-water.html this is an interesting article about it from the UK where it was apparently a much bigger scandal.  The french toast is made with 2 inch thick slices of baguette which seemed odd at first, but really makes for a superior french toast. The thicker cut seems to prevent too much moisture permeating the bread and just becomes a much better final product.  The fresh squeeze grapefruit juice was the best I've had outside of Florida. In conclusion, if they had have asked me how I wanted my duck egg cooked and perhaps suggested that I have it a certain way, I would have given them 5 stars."}
{"text":"I am glad my frd found this little cute brunch place yesterday, nth fancy, but it just feels right!  How can one say no to \"homemade\" juice?  I had grapefruit juice, while my frds had Mango lemonade.  I love the fact that it's made in house!  Everything we ordered were delicious: the duck plate (shredded duck confit w/ caramelized onion + hash, sunny side up duck egg and bread on the side), mushroom omelette, & beef sandwich.  We also ordered a pcs of choco chunk cookie, it's got the perfect texture, the choco was somewhat melting, cookie itself was not too crunchy, and soft inside!  Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Went here with my on mother's day (with my mom) for brunch. The surrounding area is haggard, but that's all part of the charm. The atmosphere inside was relaxed, and I think it's cool how the kitchen is right out in the open. The coffee was great and the food was pretty good, not mind blowing.   3 stars instead of 4 because as noted by others, the value isn't there. Portions are too small for the price, and they're obviously not putting money into rent or decor, so why the high prices..."}
{"text":"Great looking place - airy and bright. It's right around the corner from my new place so had to try it for brunch. I had a very yummy steak sandwich and my SO had eggs with smoked salmon. Both the dishes were really good and made right in front of our eyes. We went in on a saturday afternoon with a newborn and didn't feel rushed or judged. They have a decent selection of tea and baked goods. A great place to meet up over tea/coffee or hangout with a book."}
{"text":"The cured salmon and goat cheese omelet special is not to be missed.  I'm usually more of a \"heavy\" breakfast guy.  However this is one of the best breakfasts I've ever had.  Outstanding!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what about this restaurant warrants a \"Hipster\" label from other reviewers. One of the reasons for loving Hammersmith's is that it's a no-attitude diner for a great, reasonably-priced brunch. Co-owners Brittany and Colin are terrific, and the food is delicious (using local suppliers, FYI). I've been to this joint on many occasions and each time is a difficult decision between the smoked bacon omelette, or the braised beef & goat's cheese sandwich - both are equally awesome."}
{"text":"Hammersmith's looks like the typical breakfast diner with bar seating, mirrored service counter and open kitchen. The food keeps the feel of diner food, but is far above most brunch establishments in Toronto.  Duck eggs are the standard, and their duck plate with duck hash and a part fried, part baked duck egg which is still just cooked is amazing. They have a good selection of tea available and drip coffee which I suspect is better than anything you would find in a diner.  Return visits are needed to sample the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"So I'm supposedly on a diet! But eggs and smoked salmon never killed anyone? Anyway... I had full intentions of going to the infamous County General, but they don't open their doors til 11 and when you wake up at 8 am, regardless of your night out at the bar, having to starve til 11 doesn't cut it.  Thank god for Hammersmith's!!!  The place is super cute, not a lot of seats and a very laid back kitchen that you're a part of makes you feel like you're at a friend's house hanging out while they prep brunch.  The coffee is bottomless, which usually means it's crap but in this case it's really good. I also saw peeps having fresh grapefruit juice, which I think is also bottomless.  Had mini apple scones with cinnamon sugar and delicious jam from Sausage Partners, which is Leslieville's newest butcher. Followed that with a smoked salmon and egg plate, all locally sourced, that was accompanied by a zesty green salad. Yum!  The chef believes in supporting local partners and it's nice to see this come together in a delicious way. I've also heard the menu changes frequently, which with only a few options is a must.  I'll happily support them, maybe not so much the diet."}
{"text":"The menu is a little limited, but I like this little spot.  It's an open kitchen concept.  You can really see everything that's going on.  Since it's more of a neighbourhood spot, chances are if you live around here, you'll run into people you know.  Some of the menu items stray slightly from what you'd see at a typical breakfast joint.  There are items like duck on the menu. They're not really for me, but some people love it.  I had a braised beef and goats cheese sandwich. My gf had the duck plate. She stole lots of mine.  I really enjoyed it.  Total bill after tax and tip was $32. No drinks."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, and have not been disappointed.  The first time I tried the duck plate ~ delish.  It came with a duck egg, and duck hash with caramelized onions.  We've always started with the scone plate - also delish, the flavour changes daily/weekly.  The other day, I ordered the beef brisket with goat cheese sandwich, and it was also delish.  It's a quaint brunch place, not too crowded.  I like sitting at both the table and at the bar.  Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"What first attracted me to Hammermith's was their old-timey sign on the front window.  Naturally, though, I was interested in what was to come of the old Logan Grill.  It's a great corner spot in a neighbourhood that is sure to have more hip businesses pop up in the next few years.  They have kept the essential structural design of the 50's style diner that preceded it, and modernized with a sea of white and some brand new wooden tables, freshly stained no less.  When you walk in, atop the counter sits trays of cupcakes and other baked goods and they are as welcoming as the staff (perhaps they are the owners).    The menu was small when we went, about a week or so after it opened, yet what we ordered was delicious.  i had steak and eggs, with the most amazing bacon hashbrowns.  the steak was cooked perfectly, and quite flavourful.  my only beef (wink wink) with this order was that there was no steak knife to be found there...if you are going to serve steak and eggs, why not have a few around, no?  Regardless, I managed to tear through it.    my wife got some asparagus and egg mixture, probably poached, though don't quote me...it's weeks later that i'm writing this...and that too was delightful.  they even put together a egg and cheddar omelete for my little 9 month old....which is to say that they are baby/kid friendly...with new high chairs to boot.  (hate those bulky wooden ones).  anyhow, i look forward to their success and developing menu and new specials.  check it out and help this neighbourhood to flourish!!  chin chin."}
{"text":"Was expecting good things with the bacon omelette, but it was really bland. Sad because I'd heard great things about this place and this stretch of Gerrard East is desperately in need of a good brunch place. This is definitely not it."}
{"text":"Super greasy breakfast for hipsters. Odd types of meat, unheard of teas, different jellies and jams. And very weird hours. I live around the corner and would rather walk to the danforth or queen than try to fit in their overcrowded seating. Too small of a selection and not really any healthy options for those who don't want their meal drenched in animal fats. I found the prices to be too high considerig the value of the meal. My coffee was $4 which surprised me when my bill came."}
{"text":"Great food and service. I would definitely go back. The restaurant is a bit tight but I love the cosy feeling. You also can see the chef at work and he does an amazing job. Definitely recommend the braised beef sandwich with caramelized onion and goat cheese. Super yum!  Overall a place that is worth going to!"}
{"text":"We were a table for 2;  They were full when we arrived, the waitress (to die for!) offered to call us.  We waited outside, when we got our call went back.  They had pulled a part what had been a table for 4 into two tables of 2.  The problem is that they were only about an inch apart so - you are essentially having lunch with strangers.  That and the fact that the restaurant was really hot - we were over dressed in layers also - so we left.  On our way out she apologized and as we pulled away the phone rang - she had another table for us.   That was really nice.  We ordered a mushroom omlette (comes with some arugala that was underdressed).  Overall found the food edible but not something i'd crave or go out of my way for.  Portions were a little skimpy for the price."}
{"text":"Nice gem next to Chinatown East. Great service and tasty scones. They have Duck on the menu for $13! Also less likely to have crazy lineups because of the east end location."}
{"text":"I know it's not really fair to judge a restaurant purely on the decor, but Hammersmith's just looks so damn cool inside. It's a neat set up - very small space and the kitchen is entirely open. They've also maintained a lot of the previous structures from when this spot used to be an old-timey diner.  The food is simple but cooked perfectly. I loved my omelette!  I didn't partake in the baked goods, mostly because I was full and feeling cheap, but I was very tempted!"}
{"text":"VIBE  As discussed. Very laid back. Nice service. Waitress forgot to bring me jam with my scone and I was half done the scone so she gave me another one on the house.   WE ATE  I had the salmon with goat cheese omlette. It comes with the yolk intact making it for a gooey omlette. It was light, fluffy and salty. Yum-tastic!  Dining Companion had the mushroom with goat cheese omlette and loved it!  Scones are pretty crumbly but I think they're very affordable.  I also had the lemonade which was light and refreshing.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  A great neighbourhood spot. It's a nice alternative to Lady Marmelade (even if it's a lot up the street)."}
{"text":"I love duck everything!  And of course I ended up ordering Duck Egg with Duck Hash ($13) for my late lunch on a Monday at Hammersmith's.  It was delicious! A little pricey... but definitely the best duck hash I had.  My cook/server is so friendly and nice. Watching him cook in the open kitchen definitely has a homey feel... I wish I have someone that cook for me everyday.....  Hammersmith's is a good addition to this neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Beautiful little spot in East Chinatown.   I had the Duck Plate which featured duck confit hash and a large sunny side up duck egg. It was delicious. Something as rich as duck yolk and confit could easily be too heavy, but the portion size was perfect. Had the homemade Iced Tea to go with my meal, and a cup of coffee. They served my meal with a corse sea salt on the side, and my coffee came with a small dish of raw sugar.  Every detail was there.  The service was lovely, friendly and attentive. I'd go here again in a heartbeat. I'd bring friends. I'd even bring my dad. And he's really picky."}
{"text":"We just got back from a wonderful lunch at Hammersmith's and were very impressed with the food and the experience. My husband and I had two peach lemonades, an heirloom tomato and burrata cheese salad with shaved salt , cured salmon with pine nut and blanched pea salad, and a mushroom omelette with salad and baguette. Each item we had was scrumptious! We kept remarking on how each element was so well matched and prepared. Because the restaurant is open concept, we watched as each sauce and ingredient was prepared and cooked to perfection. The organic, fair trade coffee was fantastic as well! It's obvious that this couple has experience working at places such as The Drake, Czehoski and Didier.  The atmosphere was relaxing because it was a neutral white, has a lot of natural light and new light oak tables. Vintage coloured glass cake stands decorated the tops of the shelves. The bathroom could use a bit of updating, but it was clean and well tended to.  We thought the prices were pretty cheap considered the quality of the food. We will definitely come back!"}
