{"text":"A very \"hamisha\" (homey) place.  The waitress was pleasant and quick to come to our table. The food arrived promptly and very hot.  I had mushroom omelet with sausages and a crisp english muffin. My husband had the corned beef hash w poached eggs. Both meals were good, not outstanding but good.  It's a throw back  to the 60's in decor, prices, and small town friendliness that was very pleasant."}
{"text":"The rudest bartender I have ever experienced in my life he called my buddy a \"fucking idiot\" for just asking a question to him and then proceeded to insult him for being a college student. I would not give this establishment a dollar and would not recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"New in town? Don't bother. All we heard about was how great the fish sandwiches are- uh, no, never again! Huge portions of fish, but poorly prepared and greasey. Service was interesting; Bill, the older busboy was very nice, but our waitress has a serious case of ADD. She was all over the place, and despite her running around, nothing came to the table in a timely manner- not even the check. Mediocre feed and service for $29- never again!"}
{"text":"The three star rating is rather generous.  This is a hole in the wall if i've ever seen one. The food is just 'ok'. The fish is decent and thats why most people come here. The atmosphere in the dining area looks as if you mixed a rec hall, diner, and a cafeteria.  Service was shoddy.  Parking is tight. Just an average place."}
{"text":"Gail and Michelle are the best bartenders!!! Descent food at a good price! Always the cheers type atmosphere."}
{"text":"Cool 80's Bar.
Nice throw back.  Haven't been here for 30 years.  Back in the day they had 35 cent Strohs drafts.  Today it's $3.75 for a Yuengling.  Fast & friendly barkeep.  Probably be back in 10 years for a comfort beer."}
{"text":"Wed. nights it is THE place to go to hear and dance the best of the Golden Oldies.  With great DJ's you hear the best music of the 60's and can dance on the hardwood floor in front of a nice fireplace.  People are friendly, music like a sock hop and great service.  If you are expecting food like the Ritz, forget it. But, if you want a place to have a great time and a good, inexpensive meal, THIS IS IT. I am from California and go to Bobs every time I am in town.  So, If you want to listen to RAP music and eat a $25 fish sandwich, visit me in California.......otherwise, just try Bob's Inn!"}
{"text":"Typical dive bar beer selection. One of the few smoking allowed bars in the area. Known for the fish but the pizza dough is made daily by the owner and is pretty good. Great bar if you're looking for a cheap place to get a drink. 

The family dining room in the back has 2 perks, the homemade soups and amazing Sunday morning breakfast. Place hasn't been updated for at least 10 years but neither have the prices. 
The usual waitress is miserable to be around. Complains about her life to customers a lot. 

All in all decent."}
{"text":"Great dive bar.. great people, simple time fun and  exactly what you expect! Simple good bar that is a great place to take your crew!"}
