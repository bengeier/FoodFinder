{"text":"Was just there last week and my veal sandwich and eclair were great. I've been here numerous times and have yet to be disappointed, I even had them cater a birthday party with lots of veal and chicken sandwiches, cake and misc pastries. They were a huge hit with everyone at the party.   At lunch it usually gets pretty busy but they have a great system and you'll get your food pretty quick, and at a reasonable price. Seating can be a challenge at times.  Work is pretty close so I eat here pretty regularly."}
{"text":"It's got some great deserts. I recommend the deep fried cheesecake. Also their veal sandwiches, while small, are delicious. I've been often. It is a little busy at times but that's understandable being one of few Italian bakeries in the area."}
{"text":"Haven't been disappointed by anything I've ordered there. I'm not a fan of crowds so I only go early in the morning."}
{"text":"While I think they have great food and good pastries/coffee....PREPARE to WAIT IN LINE and try to make sense of the ordering process...it is archaic.  The store has three different areas for food- coffee counter, hot food counter and dessert counter.  You wait in line to order what you want separately at each counter where they each give you a order ticket and then you must go to a cashier counter to pay and then go back to the respective food counters with your receipt to wait in line again to pick up your food.  This leaves the potential of waiting in line 7 times just to get a cookie, coffee and slice!  Ugh!!!  Oh did I mention that they don't let you serve your own milk for your coffee.  I found this out the hard way and had to wait in line again to get some half and half for my coffee.  I guess this is why people just go to Tim Hortons....sometimes convenience wins over quality."}
{"text":"I found out about this place through my boss. She orders catering from them for our christmas lunches. One time, she ordered a couple dozen of the apple fritters for the employees and oh my wow!  I'm a huge fan of donuts and by far, they have the best tasting apple fritters!   Ever since, I've been a couple of times just to order the apple fritters. We've purchased fresh buns, salami and tried their chicken parmesan and veal parm sandwiches. Yummyayy!!  It just tastes home made. The service is excellent. Everyone is always smiling.   I will commute 45 minutes just to have their food and treats!"}
{"text":"Absolutely outstanding! -- in fact, a rather 'dangerous' place because their super-delicious pastry adds 30 extra minutes to my treadmill routine on daily basis (-: -- but more seriously, they have  FANTASTIC food and one of the best coffee baristas in town. The last time we went there we kept ordering cappuccinos as though there was no limit to our caffeine-absorption capacity. Highly recommended! Hope they will stay in business for many years to come."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed with the fact that it is NOT wheelchair accessible. I brought my elderly mother and 7 month old daughter in her stroller and both were a complete struggle to get in and out of he establishment! Food is incredible, however, and if you have time, must try a baked good. But please San Remo, out of respect for new moms and the elderly, get a ramp and wheelchair button (door opener)"}
{"text":"Awesome cafe for sandwiches! As we came through the door we were greeted by a window of sandwiches... turkey, porchetta, prosciutto, smoked salmon, ham and chicken tenders amongst others. We were so caught up that we didn't even make it to the hot food section... we ordered right away! Have to go back for the hot food section which had beef brisket and veal! ( saw it on the way to the cashier) =(  The pastry was a little underwhelming after that delicious toasted sandwich. Had a cherry Danish because most of the donuts were all done.  They also have a lunch special that includes a sandwich and soup combo.   Awesome find! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Came here after a friend recommended me to try their doughnuts.  I didn't realize that Sanremo was also a one stop shop for other goodies!  They also served sandwiches, daily meals, gelato and had a deli attached for cold cuts and cheeses!  So the bakery was extremely busy - ordered the Apple Fritter, Black Forrest, Chocolate Glazed doughnut, cinnamon bun and a croissant.  As well the Osso Buco with pappardelle noodles.  Well I guess it was so busy at the cashier - I ended leaving with someone else's order of doughnuts... I would of been more upset but the order was pretty close to what I wanted."}
{"text":"Everyone's reviews of the food are bang on. It's all delicious.  But this place closes at 6, not 7, even though the door is technically open. I've tried a few times to pick stuff up on my way home from work and they're not really interested in having you there. Starting at about 6pm, they employ the universal restaurant hint to please leave. They put the chairs up and take things off the shelf. I went up to the hot table tonight at 6:10 pm and waited for quite a while without even a hello as the staff cleaned up. I've crossed it off my list of places to pick up dinner and/or treats after work, but I'll back be back for lunch and weekends. The food is just too good."}
{"text":"great sandwiches, awesome deserts (my fav are the baklava and cannolis), the broccoli pizza is the best. try their gelato in the summer time its super fresh. basically everything is good!"}
{"text":"By far the best fresh made donuts and cappuccino I've had. I've been going here ever since I moved to Etobicoke. Very fast service on there busiest days. I've even come for lunch to there hot tbl , it's always fresh and clean  never leave disappointed."}
{"text":"I changed my review after receiving some explanation from San Remo manager (thank you-I really appreciate your response)... although I still wish their staff had told us the truth that they had run out some of nutella n ice cubes, instead of saying that my orders were complicated to make. If they had told us so, they would have known that they got my order wrong as I wanted a cafe latte that time, not a nutella one (no wonder my coffee tasted so sweet). And I'm sure my husband would not mind changing his order to something else if they had told him that they run out of ice cubes to make his ice coffee. Afterall we were really in a hurry that day n would like to get ours asap.. The bottom line is that truly honesty is the best policy... and surely customers would notice if they arep not being told the truth..."}
{"text":"Nice neighborhood spot. Love the nutella latte.  The place does get overcrowded and sells out of stuff early. Also, somewhat overpriced."}
{"text":"When I went to this bakery last weekend I was totally astonished. So yes, it definitely can get crowded and the lines can be long but it's so worth it. The parking can also be a bit scarce for how popular this joint is. My daughter and I went to this bakery for lunch in between her two hockey games. It was crowded at about 12:30, but the lines move fast once you understand how the shop works. I got the caprese sandwich which was the best I've had. We loved it so much we came back on Sunday just before we left for home! I would recommend this joint to anyone in the area. They have sweets, doughnuts, sandwiches, pizza, a hot bar, a salad bar, gelato, and even a deli/meat market! Will come back when we are in the area."}
{"text":"i have died and gone to donut heaven.  I will honestly sit in traffic on the Gardiner just to have 1 one these donuts.  if you ever have a chance get there early...seriously.... cause they sell out fast.  parking in terrible as there is only street parking (1 side of street only) and you have to wait sometimes, but god almighty the donuts are worth it"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Veal/meatball sandwiches, donuts, pastries, cakes, pizza, bread & espresso. It's all top notch with great attention to detail. Very busy place, but plenty of servers and you can get in and out relatively quickly."}
{"text":"Best donuts I've ever had!  This bakery is always busy, doesn't matter what time you go the line up will always be at the door."}
{"text":"So good and so affordable. Really great cake selections and lots of hot food and sandwich options. Really good lunch spot!"}
{"text":"food is very good. Coffee is also excellent. ive tried the blueberrie cheese danish it was delicious. lunch menu is good too. Staff were always friendly and efficient. I will go back at this place."}
{"text":"I went to Sanremo this morning because I was craving a donut and heard a lot about this place.    When I walked in, I felt overwhelmed by the layout.  There was too much going on.  I found my way over to the donuts and ordered both apple fritter and Boston cream.  I then crossed over to the hot table and ordered a few sandwiches as I was with my daughter.  There was no place to sit as the sitting area was full so we took everything to go.  I have to say I found everything overrated.  The donuts were...meh. ...and the sandwiches were soggy.  I'm glad I went because I've heard so much about Sanremo but I've had better (cordi bakery's  twistie donut and the chocolate ).  I don't think I will venture out there again."}
{"text":"Went in and was completely ignored and bypassed for the next customer. I was completely stunned. It was my very first visit to this business and i mist likely will never return. Perhaps my wedding ring set blinded the girls that worked there."}
{"text":"SanRemo is Italian bakery awesomeness.  Don't come here if you're on a diet.  We came during lunchtime on a weekday and it was absolutely packed! And for good reason.  The hot foods bar is awesome and you need to get the veal on a bun.  The pastries and donuts are probably the best things in the place and you could eat yourself into a coma because of how good they are.  It's an Etobicoke mainstay for good reason!"}
{"text":"Out of all of my reviews, this is one of the places that I would likely give 6 (or maybe even 7) stars! If you find yourself roaming around the streets of Etobicoke, and you're looking to grab a bite to eat, check out Sanremo Bakery.  They're located in the Royal York/Gardiner area and they offer everything you can imagine :  Gelato, coffee/espresso, authentic Italian sandwiches, hot plate meals (i.e. Veal/Chicken parm, pasta, etc), cakes, desserts, breads, deli counter, etc..etc.. **I think they even offer veggie options, but, don't quote me on that!** Planning an Italian meal? They'll likely have most of the things you'll need!   Sanremo is great for families, friends, couples, \"first dates\", and they offer ample seating indoors, and a small patio if you prefer to sit outside.  My \"go to special\" is the Prosciutto sandwich. This thing is a BEAST and can easily be shared between two people! Want to kick it up a notch? Try it with a Brio. (I know you're thinking \"I hate Brio\", but, for some strange reason, it tastes GREAT with this sandwich!)  Tips -  1) They are closed on Mondays (not sure why, but, this is common for the area!). 2) Be careful with this place! It's fantastic, but, before you know it, you'll be going 5-6 times a week and it will KILL your wallets! You've been warned..lol 3) Want to go for lunch? Arrive by 11:30, or you'll face a very very long line-up!"}
{"text":"Great food, good service and reasonably priced. I would definitely go here again. The lunch rush is serious get there early if you can :)"}
{"text":"This place is a gem! It's busy often so it makes it a little hard to find parking but it's worth it. Desserts are great , but I really enjoy the hot food table I love the sauce on the pasta and veal. If you are hungry for some great real Italian food give this place a shot!!"}
{"text":"We visited the bakery yesterday for the doughnuts. Parking was a pain, even for a weekday morning so I can only imagine the chaos during rush hour or the weekends. Service was not overly friendly, but they were fast and efficient.   Lemon meringue- this was my choice. Run, don't walk to try one.  Hands down the best doughnut I've ever had.  The meringue was perfect and the lemon curd inside was a good combination of tangy and sweet.  Nutella & Red Velvet - not sure why we bothered with these options since none of us are fans of Nutella or red velvet cake. We ended up throwing them away because six doughnuts were too much for 4 people. I can tell you that the top half of the red velvet was all cream dusted with a red powder. It didn't strike me as appetizing at all.  Maple Dip, Oreo & chocolate dip - all good, safe choices. I heard no complaints from my friends.   High stars for 4 awesome doughnuts out of 6. I will visit again."}
{"text":"Love this spot! Especially in the summer when I bike along lakeshore to get here. Their hot sandwiches are good, desserts are amazing (try their cheesecake). Prices are very reasonable and it's always packed inside. Can be a little confusing when you first go in but you figure it out quickly. I've had their veal sandwich, pork belly, Italian sausage, and a couple of other ones. All were very good."}
{"text":"Food is sooooo good.  Fabulous pizza, Italian sandwiches, panzerotti, apple fritters , biscotti. Italian cannoli  are the best outside of Sicily.  Dont order regular coffee since the Cappuccino and Americans coffees are fantastic. Great donuts. The apple fritters are the best we've ever had.  Love it. Don't be discouraged by the crowds, it's  efficiently run."}
{"text":"Deliciously different donuts that will make you salivate!  The lemon meringue will feel like a day of spring. The caramel bacon is an unlikely match but goes together perfectly. And the cinnamon roll will remind you of autumn with its deep and rich flavour.  I encourage you to try and hopefully like these donuts."}
{"text":"Went here last saturday afternoon for lunch with my girlfriend.  We had a few really nice panini sandwiches, one had smoked gouda (my favourite).  we also had a few donuts as well, I had a apple fritter and she had the banana cream, both were great.  my only complaint would be to press the sandwiches longer and the inside of one of them was still cold.  Also lots of seating to eat.  overall I would give it a 4/5, great food, I will go back to check out the hot table and more pastries.  check out my photos."}
{"text":"Best Bakery in the West End.  \"bakery\" doesn't really cover it as they are so much more. Fanta is tic products from Italy, delicious prepared meals and of course amazing baked goods too. Great service and the energy there is always bustling and positive in helping you shop for yumminess."}
{"text":"I wish donuts were a vegetable.. This place has the best donuts in the GTA! Friendly staff too."}
{"text":"Been coming here for 7 years or so, just getting around to writing a review now.  I went on a quest years ago trying nearly most all of the Italian bakeries in the GTA trying to find THE spot. Sanremo has climbed to the top #1 spot of the list over the last couple of years and for many reasons  I'll start off by saying their best item hands down is the Sicilian Cannoli. Best Cannoli in the GTA, best Cannoli in North America that I've had, some of the Best Cannoli I've had in comparison to others in Italy, Sicily, and Malta. Everything about it is perfection. Over the past few years Sanremo has altered their shell recipe, each time getting better and better until a couple of years or so ago I think is when they hit gold and have stuck with the same shell recipe. It's the best cannoli shell, crisp and a little flaky not like a hard cracker which unfortunately many places make cannoli shells like. They make it fresh, no pre-made BS. Has the perfect flavour and texture. The filling is amazing, IDK if they use sheep milk or not but it's really hard to get that good of a flavour out of cow milk and if they are using cow milk bravo to them for whatever they are doing, it's magic. Having their cannoli here is just the pinnacle of baking, you can't surpass it, it's eating the physical manifestation of someone's love and devotion to their craft. Almost like having a spiritual awakening!  I figure I would share the bulk of my feelings on my favorite item, but everything else is great here. Great bread, great pizza too. Their pizza is amazing, closest in terms of flavour I've had in Canada to a NY slice. Everything at the food bar is amazing. Their deli section is amazing, great selection of import cheese and fresh olives. Their cafe is another awesome section, their home made gelato taste like you're in Italy. Again, the bakery is amazing and everything they make is good. I've had custom cakes made from them several times too.  Everything you could want in one place is here. Amazing Bakery, deli,food counter, and cafe. The guys who are running this place now have stepped it up to an insane degree of craftsmanship over the past few years. Every section of Sanremo is afforded respect and care, not one department is lacking or getting more attention. It's inspiring to see a place do their best to give you the best they can in Italian everything. I hope 80 years from now this place is still kicking, its an institution."}
{"text":"Went a little after peak lunch time on a weekday and although it was busy, service was prompt and organized.   The veal sandwich was quite good and the portion was large.  The lobster tail pastries were also pretty good.   However, I really came here to try their donuts based on rave reviews I had read online.  There was a large selection of flavours and most were available when I went... I believe only 3 or 4 flavours were unavailable/sold out.  I would describe the donuts as being very similar to tim horton's donuts (which is not a bad thing in my opinion), but larger...and with more extravagant toppings.  The donuts are soft/pillowy as opposed to a cake donut type of texture, which I liked.  The price is also very reasonable.  My favourite was the nutella donut.   This bakery is a little out of the way for me, but if you live in the area, I would recommend checking it out.  Everything I tried was good, not mind blowingly amazing, but just good solid food."}
{"text":"Love San Remo.  It's a one stop shop, excellent Italian deli, bakery and a hard to beat hot table and gelato/coffee bar.  The hot table is famous for their veal sandwiches (best in the city!) and they have pizza, salads, pasta, and panino sandwiches.  All the hot foods are delicious and home made. It's gotten so popular you literally cannot get a seat in the cafe side anymore, ever.  Lunchtime weekdays the streets around are full of vans and trucks, tradesmen and construction types have discovered the great food at fair price.  Not fussy about their cakes and cream pastries because they use that awful fake whipping cream.  But their donuts ... heavenly.  As are the lemon tarts.  Gelato and coffee are also above average.  Great place in the neighbourhood that I seem to end up at least once a week!  They do  need more seating space, though."}
{"text":"This is the best independent bakery that serves the most delicious pies, donuts, gelatos, sandwiches of all of Toronto. We make the drive from North York whenever we can. Rob has been so kind to let me slip in at the last minute to pick up an apple pie and 2 delicious veal sandwiches. Thank you sooooo much. I literally crave for the food and get withdrawals. Try anything and everything, it is cream of the crop quality and it's a family owned business where they also have the sincerest and friendliest employees. It feel personable and the food is simply amazing!"}
{"text":"San Remo is part of my weekly routine. Caramel Latte before jumping on my Go Train. Croissants, buns, meats and cheese for lunches. Pasta and salad combos when I don't feel like cooking dinner. And don't forget a dozen donuts for Friday's at work!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what the hubba Baloo is about. Sure the bakery has a wide selection of sweet treats, but I was quite underwhelmed by the hot food. I think it's so busy because no one has time to cook and the convenience of picking up ready-made meals outweighs the lack of flavour. I couldn't eat a whole meatball sandwich, not because of the size, but because of the gross texture and blah flavour. My kids didn't want to finish their sandwiches either (veal & chicken). We highly regretted not sticking with California Sandwiches. However, if I need bakery sweets that look and taste great I will come here again...and because of all the seasoned reviewers ravings I plan on giving this place another chance to make sure I wasn't just there on a bad day."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Italian Bakeries I have come across in the Toronto area.  They have a hot table with excellent lunch options.  I also buy my deli and desserts here. The sicilian cannoli's are the best I have ever had!! I am so glad this is on my way home from work!!! Parking is not the easiest on weekends, but i try to go during the week or really early on a Saturday."}
{"text":"Completely overrated.  First time I went, I got a latte to go and it was lukewarm.   2nd time I went, we had lunch there and the woman we ordered from acted like she would rather eat her own fecal matter than take our order.   Once we finished our good but nothing incredible meatballs- we went to the pastry counter. I asked the girl at the counter what the filling was in the hazelnut cannoli- she replied \"pure Nutella\". She obviously didn't know the answer but instead of saying \"one moment let me find out\" she lied. So I told her there was no way it was Nutella (that would not make it a cannoli! And the filling was a light brown cream .. not the colour of Nutella). She began arguing me- I finally told her to just ask someone - it's usually either ricotta, mascarpone or custard. Finally she did, and said it was custard mixed with Nutella.  We ordered one, it was fine- but my experience there was tainted by incompetent and rude service. We won't be returning"}
{"text":"Great fresh baked goods. I have been in here to have a great sandwich, the bread was so fresh and so where the ingredients. I have tried the pizza as well and again the dough was fresh and light. Then i tried the dessert counter and again everything was excellent. Great little bakery with everything you need in one spot. Nice patio area as well with the canopies in place."}
{"text":"Delicious! I ordered a custom birthday cake for my son's 4th birthday party. The cake was $65 after tax which is a steal for custom birthday cakes! And it was so delicious! I've had cakes from other bakeries that are $100+ and smaller and not as delicious. I will definitely be ordering custom cakes from them again. The buttercream was so good!"}
{"text":"4 stars reflects a combination of food and customer service: I would rate the food quality and freshness 5 stars. It's delicious, consistent and reliable. Their made to order cakes are DELICIOUS!!  Sadly their staff get a much lower rating of 3 stars... Those at the coffee bar in particular look miserable and act as though they are being inconvenienced and are doing customers a favor. I continue to return for their food but certainly not for their staff - they could use some training in this area. Disappointing for a local and legendary bakery."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! To get straight to the point, there's tons of variety, absolutely delicious, high quality, excellent prices. I've been to several bakeries in the city and abroad and Sanremo is hands down the best by far!"}
{"text":"Thank u Sanremo for having the yummiest bakery in Etobicoke! Our family with 4 boys devoured the italian sandwiches (veal and ... chicken that was not dry whoo hoo!), Apple fritter donut, red velvet donut, regular glazed and sprinkles donuts (which they deem as ALL their favs) and oohed and ahhed over the canolis. Also picked up a delish loaf of squishy, tasty bread and today wishing it werent Mon so we could get more. I think we were so excited that we forgot half our order and the nice lady looked around and found us still roaming the store. Oh, and the butter tart ... our poor American friends are missing out on this lovely Cdn dessert which u make so well (thank u for offering a pecan-less option)"}
{"text":"Best apple fritters in the universe.  The coffee cake is moist and delicious too.  The hot table is decent but nothing special.  Those apple fritters though man, I could eat a whole dozen of them."}
{"text":"Okay this place is cool. I had heard about this place but hadn't had a chance to really check it out.  We were driving by on our way to a friends place, but we were hungry so we stopped in and grabbed some sandwiches, which were delicious!  We later walked back and chose a selection of donuts to enjoy later.  Although it's probably something I wouldn't have every day, the donuts were fun and delicious!  There were sooooo many things I wanted to try, and it's a good thing I forgot my wallet, or I would have likely bought many more pastries and treats \"just to try\".  My friends generously bought the donuts and we enjoyed them together."}
{"text":"Wanted some good cappuccino and end up buying bread and 3 other pastries.  This is a gem"}
{"text":"always enjoy the smell of fresh bread and donuts! awesome place!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Probably not much to add that hasn't already been stated in other reviews, but really glad we live near this place. Best donuts ever, and tons of sweet treats that are all delicious. The hot food is also very good (we often get the veal or chicken sandwiches). Now that our butcher is a couple doors down, it's hard to resist stopping into Sanremo after!"}
{"text":"I love everything at San Remo! The sandwiches are so good (turkey on foccacia or roast beef on focaccia are my fave). We often cater San Remo sandwiches for our family events. They are a big hit. Great rye bread and my kids love the doughnuts. It is a chaotic place on weekends because it is so popular, but that's part of the fun."}
{"text":"Since moving to the area last year, I've frequented San Remo when I've wanted a good lunch or some quality pastries.  You can get great deli sandwiches, pizzas, and other real Italian lunches.  You can also buy meats and cheeses to take home.    The bakery counter is full of great treats - cannoli, eclairs, custard tarts, cookies and cakes galore -- you name it, that bakery counter has it!  Very handy if you want to pick up a selection as a hostess gift, or when having visitors.    There is also ample selection of fresh breads.  And a coffee/espresso counter as well.   A great place to pop in for lunch - whether on the go or eating there.  The place is clean, open, and tons of selection."}
{"text":"Great place, staff are always friendly and helpful! Everything from fresh to frozen here, even a decent hot counter. My only issue is they never seam to be open in the evenings. Often closes early."}
{"text":"An employee came out with Lysol wipes to clean our table on the patio!! Got this yummy Oreo Cheesecake for $4 bucks! Mmm"}
{"text":"Love this place! It has everything you're looking for! Went to grab some donuts a few weekends ago and they are to die for! So many yummy different flavors! Always very busy though, so try and get their early before all the good stuff clear out!"}
{"text":"This place used to be good ,but like all places that know they are good they eventually loose their product and rely on their name. Just went in there for a sandwich, was expecting the same sandwich I had 3 years ago, and no just a dry bun with a piece of veal and cheap cheese. Cost for a bun and a piece of veal, 5.99+hst.... The staff were also rude and not approachable. They just wanted you to pay and get out."}
{"text":"Great bakery a nice selection of breads and cold cuts. The hot food is good but what stands out for me is there roast beef Pannini . It has these crunch onions in it and a great sauce. It is also big enough so two can share 1 order.  I buy my pizza dough there it is cheap and really good"}
{"text":"It was a great service. The Tiramisu Cake had a very nice presentation and the price was very reasonable. I would totally recommend it."}
{"text":"This place is THE BEST. There always seems to be a lot of people when I go in but the wait time is not bad at all , goes quickly , the staff has always been super nice even tho they are crazy busy and it is a organized line because you take a number . Keeps the line going quickly and easy. I would recommend this place . It's my fav bakery . Also it's Italian but they have Portuguese natas. Just they call them custard tarts. They are delicious . You have to go to this bakery :)"}
{"text":"I used to look forward to 8:30am shifts because of this bakery!  They open up nice and early so you can just drop in and grab fresh bread/pastries or coffee on the way. They also have a fairly sized dining area (seats approx. 20 people) so if you're not in a hurry you can sit down and enjoy their menu. In the summer they open up their patio, if you'd like to enjoy the nice summer breeze.  Their almond croissants are AMAZING! Get them first thing in the morning so they're warm and fresh.  Or if you want to try unique donuts such as maple bacon, Nutella, red velvet and more, then this is the place. I'd recommend coming earlier in the day to have more choices as they do sell out on popular flavors and don't make anymore for the day.   Unfortunately, I don't work close to San Remo anymore but will try to wake up early on weekends to enjoy their fresh croissants again!  The staff are so helpful and friendly (such a huge plus!  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"One of my favourite gems in Etobicoke!!  Their veal sandwich is absolutely heavenly and so are their lattes. It gets a little busy, but deservedly so for a mom-and-pop bakery that really knows their stuff. Freshly baked goods and the aroma of bread and gluten goodness that just hits you the moment you walk in.  Ample seating and the perfect place to catch up with friends over coffee and pastries.  Fun tip: they'll also print custom images on your lattes free of charge, so don't hesitate to ask the barista about it if it's not too busy! It's such a nice treat :)"}
{"text":"Omg the cannolis are to die for. My brother has been to Mike's in Boston, and his response to eating one? \"This is a _good_ cannoli!\""}
{"text":"I live down the street from Sanremo and until a year ago (when I moved to Mimico) I've never heard of it.  However, MANY of my friends/clients/colleagues have heard of it before and absolutely love it there.  I discovered it the day after I moved into the area and was headed to IKEA to purchase some items. As I drove by, I saw a lot of activity on the Sanremo side of the street and noticed the patio tables and chairs. I had to stop and check out the action, as you know what they say... if there's a line up in front of a food joint - you know it's going to be good!  When we walked in, it was organized chaos. It was PACKED inside, so we walked around to orient ourselves. There was a deli/cheese section, hot foods (sandwiches, pizza, lasagna etc.), cafe bar, gelato parlour and in the back was the fresh breads and then.... the BAKERY.  Holy \"Moly\" guys.... we're talking the creme-de-la-creme of bakeries. Gourmet Donuts (before noon as they sell out fast) like lemon meringue, Nutella with Skor bits, red velvet, key lime donuts AND then there's the bakery sweets like fresh cupcakes and then there's the custom ordered gourmet cakes. It's endless.  Anyway - hit it up as you'll be grinning ear to ear once you walk in.  Their Nutella Latte's are quite awesome too."}
{"text":"I went there yesterday to buy a pastry for my family because I always passed the bakery on my way home. So I dropped by....and it was amazing!  Good Italian bakery...it reminds me Monastery Bakery in Oakville which I like.  There was so many selection of pastry but I got a fresh blueberry coffee cake for a gift and few Eclairs for myself. And Chocolate Eclairs are HUGE but me and my husband couldn't stop...I will definitely go back to try another pastry and some loaf next time.  (FYI, blueberry coffee cake was moist and it only $5.99!)"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch.  Best sandwiches I've had in a while. They have delicious ready to go sandwiches (they're huge too) and some hot ones made on the spot.  Be sure to give yourself some time at lunch as parking can be scarce and line ups can be long...but we'll worth it.  Got some time? Browse the pastries while you're there."}
{"text":"Been wanting to go to this bakery for quite some time now and I finally made it out yesterday and I can see why there's such a craze about the place.  Their system to service their customers in the bakery section, however, needs more improvement.  That or they need to ensure that all staff are properly trained on how to treat customers in a polite manner.  This doesn't apply of course to everyone, but just the young lady who assisted me.  She was rude by continuously interrupting me whenever I spoke, after the fact that she kept asking what I wanted to order.   Custard Tarts - Was not overly sweet and the crust was nice and flaky.  Custard was also perfectly cooked.  Perfect thing to have if you want something quick and light. 5/5  Curant Cheesecake - Nice and creamy. What I think I like most about the crust was that it was a little cakey. Also had a nice toasted flavour to it. If all their cheesecakes are like this, I would definitely try the rest. 5/5  Caramel Crunch Cake - You can get a personal sized one! Perfect for when you want some and don't want to share, lol.  A little on the sweet side, though.  4/5.  Veal Sandwich - I was expecting this to be a little on the \"tough\" size but it was perfection.  Simple yet so much flavour.  This was probably the highlight of my trip and could honestly see myself driving all the way from Scarborough for it. 5/5  Pepperoni Pizza - Was expecting to be blown away with their pizza but I was pretty disappointed.  On the plus side, they're generous with their pepperoni. 2/5."}
{"text":"As both a baker and an italian, this is hands down one of my most favorite everything!!!  I frequently drive 1.5 hrs to get pastry, pizza, flatbread."}
{"text":"Please. Don't think of this place's doughnuts as a regular doughnut. Doughnuts offered in Sanremo are work of arts. Enough said.  The moment I walked in, I was overwhelmed by the delicious doughnut smell. If I were in the Charile Winka's chocolate factory, this would probably be the excitement that I would  experience!!!!!!!  The doughnuts display was beauriful. Never seen such an appetizing, good-looking, so defined doughnuts in my life! In addition to the \"beautifully looking doughnuts,\" I was SHOCKED by how delicious the doughnuts were. They were just so good. I can not think of any word that can describe how amazing the doughnuts were!!!   Whenever I need to satisfy a donut craving, Sanremo is where I go. For $3-3.50, they are well worth the buy for the size and taste. They're always fresh, fluffy, and not too sweet. The coconut one I had was fluffy, amazingly delicious and big enough to made me keep going.  They have a lot more goodies I have to go back and try other baked goods. But this review is just on  there dougnuts."}
{"text":"Prices a tad steep for the amount of food you get, however the quality of the food is great, and customer service is decent.  I've been to Sanremo a handful of times, and they carry sandwiches, sweets, and the like.  Every time I've purchased a sandwich from there, it was fresh, tasty, and satisfying.  I definitely see me returning to this venue again in the future."}
{"text":"Great local variety that does superb home made pastries. The lunch table is a decent value with traditional Italian foods. They carry some hard to find foods in s small little grocery setting as well.  Once you go, you'll be back!"}
{"text":"Food is terrible, not what it used to be.  Managers are rude and yell at employees in front of customers.   Flies hover around the pastry section and the floors were sticky.  Never going there again."}
{"text":"My grandparents used to own a store just 3 stores down from SanRemo so i've been coming here my whole life and i've never been disappointed! Everything is always fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Best hot table ever, fresh porchetta with crispy cracklin, awesome breads, delish sweets, nice imported Italian goods.  If not for this place I would have given up a long time a go."}
{"text":"Good bakery, but it's chaos in there. Worst layout ever, even with the expansion. It's terribly confusing. It's good but not good enough to go through that again."}
{"text":"Sanremo Bakery is definitely a sensory overload as soon as you walk in. They have everything and anything you could possible think a European Bakery could have.... from Fresh breads, to delicious pastries, and decadent desserts like donuts. The list goes on as they also offer fresh deli meats, hot food and coffee to go with all the fixings.   My husband and I after a long wait, finally made our way to visit San Remo. We live around the area and despite the cold sunday - it was just the right day! We had some friends coming over and I didn't have time to make dessert.   I'm not sure if its the fact that we went their on an empty stomach, but everything was just delectable. To eat there for breakfast we had: Blueberry Danish, Carrot Cake and two cappucinos. TO GO we got two nutella donuts, a gardoni and a pistachio cannoli. My overall review was that the pastries were very good just as most italian pastries are. My only complaint was the coffee. Unfortunately because it was so busy, I think the person who made our coffee rushed it a bit, so my cappucino was a luke warm to cold.   But we're definitely going to visit again, maybe at a time that is less busy, to try out their hot foods this time around.  Overall though, the staff is friendly, and this is a very well presented bakery."}
{"text":"Best in the city cakes treats, sandwiches and more!! Italian bakery quality is 10/10 price is fair. A rear gem"}
{"text":"Holy grail bakery. I wish I could give them one million stars. I have had their cheesecake, cupcakes, cannoli, donuts, and various hot table times and of course, the bread.   The donuts are very reasonably priced and absolutely delicious. Their individual pizzas are super tasty. Cheese ravioli is amazing. Nutella latte is delicious. I can't want for summer to try their gelato and the gelato donut sammy. I believe it will be a revelation.   I see a few reviews complaining about how just or crowded it is, or that the servers are slow or making mistakes. Gotta say - give me a break? It's a small family run business, clearly they are busy because their food is delicious. If they were empty, I would consider that a red flag. And the people working the counter? Teens in high school, maybe their first job. It's not a fine dining restaurant, you are not spending 10,000$ on donuts. So chill. Sorry for the rant. I'm just against the ass kissing people think they are entitled to when they spend a few bucks somewhere.   Anyhoodles, I highly recommend you drop in and see for yourself. Can't wait to see what happens when they complete their renovations."}
{"text":"This is THE spot! All I can say is that it truly is one of a kind with service and good quality and fresh baked goods. I went in to check out their cake selection for a birthday and wow! They all looked so delicious and tempting! I chose the strawberry shortcake and trust me when I say that cake was melt-in-your-mouth-goodness that was savoured and enjoyed all ages!  You have to pick up a number to be served but let me say they are just as sweet as the goods they sell when serving their customers!! I was so surprised at how friendly and accommodating they were with each and everyone that was in line to be helped. I have yet to see a place that busy and still all their employees took their time to ensure best customer service possible! Kudos to you San Remo for ensuring both good quality goods and super sweet employees and service for ALL your customers!"}
{"text":"Sanremo has become my go to spot! It can be a little overwhelming at first, because it's often busy and there's a lot of different counters, however once you get the hang of how it works it's a fantastic little spot! You can get any image that you want in your latte, which I think is a really fun addition to your morning coffee! Their cappuccinos and matcha tea lattes are my favorite. The strawberry granita is great for summer as well. Perhaps the best part of Sanremo, is their croissants. They are always baked perfectly and the fillings are amazing! Definitely check it out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"How have a lived down the street for so many years and only discovered this gem recently. This is a wonderful family run bakery with the best quality of products available. Don't make the same mistake I did and show up Saturday morning without pre-ordering your doughnuts 24 hours in advance. You still won't be disappointed because they have lots of other delicious treats to get if they are sold out of doughnuts. They also have a wonderful hot table and a big selection of sandwiches. I picked up one for myself and my husband. Left them in the fridge for later. My husband enjoyed his so much he ate mine too. Worth checking out if you're in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Picked up caramel cake from here. It was amazing!  Many many hours later it was still moist and delicious. I had to be forcibly held back from devouring the entire cake :(  Repeat: Yes!"}
{"text":"Sanremo Bakery is a heavenly good place in Toronto and thank God it takes 5 min drive from my place to get there. The food is so fresh and the range of it is very wide that you need to come back here again again to try it all. From the dessert varieties my favorite one is a blueberry cheesecake Every its bite literally melts in your mouth.  The only struggle I have there is to find a parking spot, especially on Fridays and Saturdays it's almost like the mission impossible."}
{"text":"I feel really bad giving Sanremo a 3 star review because I really love the place but there are no 3.5 star options and I can't, in good conscience, give a 4 star rating.  Firstly, they have FANTASTIC service!  The young ladies, and the more established ladies who lead them are all excellent and personable.  I often think my daughter should go apply there for a job.  Great staff.    The coffee is fantastic.  My Americano was just great yesterday.  The sandwiches are not bad.  Great bread, decent ingredients, usually too dry for my liking.  I have had mouth watering sandwiches there in the past but can't seem to find them again.... they probably still exist there so that's on me more than on them.  The pastries, are honestly a solid 3.5 stars in my opinion.  They aren't bad at all, and some are even good.  Their eclairs are good and their canolis are better than that.  Their brownies are very middle of the road, the kind that look way better than they taste, which is too bad because they look decadent and rich and amazing, but they don't have much chocolate flavour compared to the way they look.  The doughnuts are not bad either but not amazing.  Overall, SOME of the pastries aren't as good as they look or as good as good as many other places, but the place has a charm, great bread and great staff.  And great coffee.... and some pastries are good (like canolis).  So, despite my 3 star rating, I'd suggest you go try them out.  And despite my 3 star rating, I'm actually a fan of Sanremo anyway.  It often falls short of \"wooooow, that's amazing!\" but it's never \"that's not good\" either."}
{"text":"San Remo Bakery is a great place for lunch, coffee, and desert. The sandwiches are fairly priced, and are yummy. The deserts are definitely tasty and fairly cheap as well. A great experience everytime, the deserts are unforgettable, and incredibly good!"}
{"text":"Huge portions of sandwiches! If you don't know what you want to eat, come here because the options are endless.  The downside was that the paying system takes a little getting used to. Having to order, then go to another counter to pay and then go back seems very odd but the food is worth getting used to it. But beware! The only seating are the table outside. So don't expect to find a place to sit if it's a busy weekend."}
{"text":"Finally went to see this place myself. These donuts are AWESOME! Even better when fresh in the morning!  Had to update it to a 5 star! I haven't tried their other selections( coffee, other baked items and deli) but I look forward to it. But for now, hands down best donuts in Toronto!  Tips: 1. You should pre-order your donuts beforehand. You need to order 24 hours ahead of time. $8.99 for 1/2 dozen; $16.99 for dozen I was there 1/2 hour after it opened and the wild berry and blueberry cream cheese were all sold out!!!  Pre-order so you can try those and don't have to wait in line. 2. If it gets busy, remember to get a number! It's on your left hand side when you see the donut counter.  My personal favourites: 1. Coconut Cream  2. Apple Fritter"}
{"text":"I've never been to this place but I had my birthday cake from here and it was yummy to the power infinity. It was the best cake I ever tasted and to die for. The cake was made up of hazelnuts and chocolate.  I heard they have an amazing collection of donuts and hope to try them very soon"}
{"text":"This is one of those gems that you think about giving a 1-star just because you don't want it to get over-flooded with people.  But how could I say anything bad about this place?  It is awesome. Their donuts are so out-of-this-world delicious that in order to get your hands on it,  you have to order 24-hours in advance or go as soon as it opens. The nutella is a must must must-try!! Whether you order from the hot food counter (the veal sandwich is the popular choice and yummy) or the sandwich counter (can't go wrong with the massive porchetta submarine) the bread area (just breathe in all the goodness as you pick up the pizza bread) the java counter (where you can make prints in your foam) or the dessert counter (there's too much goodness here to list but I'm sure there is something here that will make any sugar feen happy) there is so much freshness and taste to not come back again and again.  Only bad thing I could say is running out of their famous in-house made donuts early in the day and seating is very limited."}
{"text":"The greatest doughnut ever !!!! This place was awesome !!!! So many options. The doughnut was moist and so fresh! So many delicious flavours to choose from."}
{"text":"Great Place for a Coffee and Sandwiches. Busy on the weekends but well worth the wait. food is always fresh."}
{"text":"Akin to the traditional Italian Bakeries I grew up on in Vaughan and Richmond Hill, this spot is a cornerstone in the Etobicoke neighbourhood of Mimico!   Located just south of The Gardiner on Royal York (NB: you cannot access RY from Gardiner so get off at Kipling or Islington, head south to Evans Ave and take that East to Royal York before going south).  I used to work a few blocks away and SanRemo was always the place to go for lunch - and I mean that for EVERYONE. Come at lunch and be prepared to face long line ups, however the staff here have this place humming like a well oiled machine and these lines get dealt with lickity-split!  My most recent visit was to stop in for an Espresso and a Zeppole as I'd heard their Zeppole was tops. Much to my disappointment when I arrived my friend and I discovered that they had stopped making them as of March 31st. I thought it was common practice to make them until Easter, no? To add insult to injury the Eastern european woman manning the dessert counter was snippy when I inquired, as if she had been asked 1 Million times that day about the Zeppole. I'm sorry if I was 1 million and 1 but some civility and even a fake apology would have made me feel less bad about missing out. Next time how bout a smile sweetheart? OK, Thanks - remember that say about attracting flies with honey....  Anyway, enough about the UNPLEASANT and more about what became known as \"the back up plan\" for my visit. Lunch, Espresso and one of San Remo's famed doughnuts!   For lunch I went for the Veal lunch special which included, Veal with all toppings, on a bun with a drink and salad. I think it was about $9.99 +tax (but I feel as if It may have been more). They make a phenomenal veal sangwich, not the best, but definitely top 3-5 in my life, and I'm a man who knows his fatina, (Italian for veal).  New espresso machines recently brought in served up excellent espresso shots which had the perfect amount of creama on top to support a healthy portion of sugar (side note, I always pretend the sugar is sinking ship as I watch it eventually fall into the coffee darkness below the surface).  And last. But not. Least. The doughnut. Long had I heard about them but seldom had remembered to have one. At lunch there were still 8 shelves of doughnuts FULL, so don't get angry at these guys for selling out if you're there late in the day, by lunch there was more on display then at Timmies! I had the Nutella doughnut which was perfectly cooked, huge, puffy cake, topped with a swirl of nutella and powdered sugar and filled with a healthy amount of sweet chocolate filling! Delicious. A standard doughnut but done exceptionally well.   With the quality of the food here, I'm scared that this is my local Italian bakery now - I predict many more trips for espresso, doughnuts, veal and well everything else they carry! Just need a little shine on that customer service and that should earn you that 5th star!  Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"As disappointing as it gets! Sanremo was a staple for my family for years when an older gentleman was the main chef. Since then service has dropped significantly. I went there tonight in hopes of reviving my love for this place. I picked up some pastries for the family to enjoy. The staff was standing around joking - it's like you are insulting them when you interrupt to place an order.   Ordered a box of pastries and they were happy to package it up. It wasn't until I realized when I got home that they packaged the wrong box. Spent a good amount of money on an assortment of pastries and instead had  3 cannolis in front of me. Since they were already closed, we had them and let this mistake slide. I essentially paid $20 bucks for what tasted like day old cannolis.   Serving customers is not rocket science, I don't understand why there are always issues here."}
{"text":"Busy, Typical fast Italian products for high price. Very slow service. Kind of mess. Gelato forget it. Cookies are good. Sweets are ok , yet too sugary and not as balanced. Coffee just ok. Fast food for not as good price. Despite all the clients they have , they are not spending on high quality stuff. Let's say below average but rated as good as there are not many business as such in the crowded south Etobicoke area."}
{"text":"This place has everything you want.  Fresh bread, baked treats (croissants, muffins, pies, tarts, etc),fresh desserts, italian hot-table, deli, homemade pizza, espresso bar, canned goods, dry pasta...and a seating area inside and small patio out front.    The staff are friendly, the place is clean...it's always busy, but there's never a long lineup to pay.  The pizza is some of the best you'll have in this city.  The spicy pizza has a kick to it, very nice.  The veal sandwich is tender, but the star is the sauce.  Tastes like an italian nonna made it.    I go here every weekend for something.  Best bakery I've been to."}
{"text":"How can you not be a fan of this venerable neighbourhood Italian food fest of a bakery.  Places like this are what sets Toronto apart from other cities. Walk in and get in line for some great savoury specials like their veal or chicken cutlet sammies topped with delicious grilled peppers and sweet tomato sauce slathered over a fresh Italian bun. Solid value! I haven't tried the sweets but they looked amazing, sitting there under glass just waiting for someone to devour them. And the coffee counter looked awesome too, with a sign asking for you to request some latte art, like a logo or similar for your Italian coffee drink. The staff looked to be local family and were cheerful and seemed happy to be there; what a nice atmosphere that creates. Easy parking in the area around the bakery, which seemed almost the size of a Shoppers Drug Mart with big windows facing a busy Royal York Road. Recommended if you are in the area and tired of Wendy's and the other fast food up on Queensway."}
{"text":"Been going here for over 3 years. 3 times a month. Tried pretty much everything.  Their donuts and apple fritters are really good. Not so heavy or oily. Black forest cake is very good also. Cheesecakes are always dry. Bland scnes....but good danish. I like their almond croissant, but don't expect it like what you've eaten at a frech bakery. It's a grocery store style...but taste good. Cookies are not made with butter. Maybe some of them but mostly not. Their shortbread butter cookies don't even taste anything like butter. Strange. I like the hot table. The veal sandwiches!! Love it. Cold/hot sandwiches are very good too, but everything is a bit saulty. Love their coffee. Love americano. Biscottis are not fresh...'stale taste' always, all the time. I tried it like over 20 times...but always same....stale. Cannoli is huge. I like the ricotta filling, but they are soggy....ALL THE TIME. I only come here for the hot table and donuts..and sometimes for cakes. Parking can be hard to find sometimes."}
{"text":"This place is great but they definitely need to (and can most likely, definitely afford to)...expand.  Way too busy for the amount of traffic through that place!!"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. It has recently been renovated. The pastries are wonderful, the breads are great. The staff is very friendly. Their breakfast options and crazy huge sandwiches are FANTASTIC. It is worth the visit to Mimico if you haven't already been."}
{"text":"San Remo can dough no wrong. Best sandies and doughnuts in the city. Dough nut change a thing"}
{"text":"Bakery doesn't even begin to sum up Sanremo - they do everything from coffee and baked goods to breads, meats, and pizza. There are multiple counters inside that are specialized in each of these different areas. I came here specifically for the Toronto raptors themed lattes (free latte art) and was not disappointed! The staff are so friendly, and at $2.88 for a regular sized latte with latte art of your choice you really can't go wrong. #Letsgoraptors"}
{"text":"Succulent Italian style pulled pork, in a sandwich, with explosive Italian hot chili pepper antipasto. A depth charge that jolts the average sub out of the water. A perfect escape from near-suburban purgatorial wanderings for the jaded urbanite."}
{"text":"Folks here is some news this place is down right excellent.  I read a lot about the doughnuts served at this spot so when I was in the vicinity I had to make a quick stop to get my dessert fix. I was expecting an old style bakery but I was in for a treat.  Right from the door there was a lot of hustle and bustle, a very good sign for a place like this. In fact it was so packed that there were lineups at the hot food counter that were at least 15-20 people deep.  The setup has a modern and clean feel.  I wanted to give this place a thorough look but then I got a glimpse of the dessert counter and like a moth to a flame I was drawn to it. Just a beautiful display with amazing looking apple fritter (I will get you next time), Italian desserts, cakes, stunning biscotti (next time as well) and lemon merignue pie that was almost 5 inches high! I needed a caffeine jolt and asked where I could get some, they pointed to the entrance.  I asked for a doppio and waited anxiously thinking what should I get for dessert. I saw the doughnuts and they had only one variety left so I decided to try their claim to fame product.  The espresso shot had a lot of crema and the cup was nice and warm (kudos for doing it the right way) and the good part was I could just take my coffee and pay at the dessert counter altogether. The doughnut is done in a  traditional style and is quite good (though I would still prefer Krispy Kreme Original Glazed fresh of the production line any day, they are like mother's milk there is simply no alternate!). High marks here folks as I will be back for sure to try this spot for their breads, Pizza and whatever they make fresh. updated June 10th. I have tried enough of their other items to form a better opinion. The desserts apart form a few items are quite mundane and can't be recommended, I got some almond biscuits, Biscotti and carrot cake and nothing stood out. So Stick to their claim to fame."}
{"text":"The offerings are pretty good, but I refuse to go there anymore. Especially on weekends. The parking is atrocious (there is none, so you have to scour the surrounding streets) and the shop itself is so crowded, I'm afraid someone's going to go postal."}
{"text":"You can always judge a place by how busy it is. If you're reading a review from someone saying \" I don't know what all the hype is about\". Well, if there were any truth to that, then the place would not be packed full of customers almost from opening to closing time.  I have tried a lot of different food items here. I can say that almost everything was much better than average. My favourites are the apple fritters and huge cold cut sandwiches. Custom ordered sfogliatelle cake is the best in Toronto. And if you don't know what this is...I suggest you order one. It is pronounced   (sfoya tella)  Yes some days you may get a food item that wasn't as good as the last time. This is based on a constellation of factors.  But then you go back again, and it was better then the first time.  I am Italian and I have been to almost every Italian bakery in Toronto.  My opinion by far that this bakery is the best.  And whomever compared their donuts to Tim Hortons must have lost their sense of smell and taste.  People don't line up and take numbers to buy Tim Hortons donuts.  One day I was placing an order and three different customers kept interrupting asking if there were any apple fritters left."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and was very impressed at how large this bakery was with different sections for espresso, hot table, bakery, desserts and seating area.  I got the lunch special for $8.99.  It comes with a main, side, bun and drink.  I ordered a meatball sandwich and cannelloni with a Brio ($0.25 more).  On the sandwich I just got extra sauce because I really just wanted to get a good taste of the bread, sauce and meat...and additional toppings are $0.50 more each.  This sandwich is so simple but so good because that bread is so fresh!  That sauce is pretty good and meatballs are juicy and well-flavoured.  Cannelloni was very basic with ricotta and sauce...not bad.  I tried to save room for a donut or almond croissant but failed.  I want to try their veal next...and maybe pizza.    What I'm trying to figure out  now is who's buns are better Caldense or SanRemo for sandwiches...so fresh and so good."}
{"text":"After following this place on Instagram for at least a year, I fangirled when I walked in.   Yes, I fangirled at a bakery, don't judge.  I've never been so giddy and overwhelmed from walking into...well anywhere, but I totally was. Deli on the right of the entrance and a whole lot of everything to the left. I walked through it 3 times before deciding and I probably changed my mind that many times.   I wanted to try their donuts, but they were almost sold out by the time we got there. Apparently, if you're not there by 2pm, the popular items are gone!  They had lots of seating inside and out. Even though there were lines for everything, there was still seats. I got the cheese ravioli. They gave you 4. They were each the size of the palm of my hand and bursting with cheese. The sauce was absolutely divine! I wish I lived closer....but it's probably better for my wallet and waistline that I don't.  Busy? Yes. Worth it? OMGYES."}
{"text":"I've been to San Remo twice and i love it here. The first time, we came simply to try the donuts, and they were delicious. We came hoping to get the maple bacon donut, but they had run out before we got there. The same thing happened the second time. Now we know to call a day or two beforehand.   The second time (today) that we went there, it was early in the afternoon so in addition to grabbing a couple of donuts, my boyfriend and I decided to share a panzerotti. Man, I'm so glad that we did. We got the mushroom and cheese one and it was absolutely delicious-I definitely recommend. Aside from that, the staff is very friendly-both at the bakery and on social media (Instagram). I recently read on San remo's Twitter account that they were voted as having one of the top 5 pizzas in Toronto, and their panzerotti definitely proved that to me. I will of course be coming back"}

{"text":"DON'T ORDER ANY CUSTOM CAKES FROM SAN REMO BAKERY  I went in to order a custom cake for my mom's birthday.  I was really excited to order from this place because I worked with some people who raved how good this place is.   Even though it is out of my way. I made a special trip to order my mom's birthday cake. I couldn't wait to try there cakes. The same day I placed the order I decided to buy some cookies, crossaints and some pastries.  Though they were expensive I wanted to see what all the hype was about.  Everything I purchased was more than the cake I ordered. The crossaints were $2.99 each and the cream horns were $3.50 each and the cookies go by weight.. By the time I finished I had spend almost $40 on everything.  First my mom and I tried the Italian cookies, we found them to sweet and under cooked. These are cookies that I have made myself before.  So we were not impressed by the way they made them.  Second we tried the crossaints.  I have to tell you that those were awesome.  I will give them that.  The nutella and almond were amazing. Then we tried the cream horns.  They weren't bad it just felt like they used cool whip inside the cream horns.   I get home and look at my bill.  I noticed the girl overcharged me for a extra cream horn that I didn't order.  SO WATCH YOUR BILL EVERYONE YOU MIGHT GET OVERCHARGED FOR SOMETHING YOU DIDN'T ORDER.  I had to go back and pick up the cake for my mom's birthday. I bring the bill with me and I mentioned this to the same person who overcharged me and she looked at me as though I had horns coming out of my head. Then I said to her their is the owner I will speak to him.  I mention this to him and he almost didn't believe me. He asked me if I had called in about this.  Oh i didn't know customers have to call in.  I am showing him the bill what more does this guy want.  I pick up the cake and it takes them 15 minutes to get this cake. The owner said it would be ready by 1 pm. I couldn't understand why it would take them so long to bring it out. I guess they were still working on it.  To make a long story short everyone who ate the cake got sick. Diarrhea and upset stomach. Then I call the bakery and I explained that everyone got sick from the cake and he has the audacity to say THATS NOT POSSIBLE. OUT OF 3,000 CAKES YOU ARE TRYING TO TELL ME THAT YOU ARE SICK FROM IT NO WAY.  THEN HE GOES ON TO SAY WHY DIDN'T THE OTHER PEOPLE CALL ME TO SAY THEY GOT SICK.  WHAT AN IDIOT HE IS.  I TOLD HIM I AM THE ONE WHO ORDERED IT.  Like I'm going to have everyone who ate that cake call him.  I couldn't believe it. He refused to accept that everyone who ate this cake got sick. He said to me THAT YOU CANNOT GET SICK FROM SHORTENING. No wonder the cake tasted heavy and sweet. Every one had to remove the frosting because it was gross.  I have ordered many cakes before at different bakeries and never ever have I or my guests gotten sick over cake.  I said to him maybe something was bad.  He refused to hear a word I had to say. He wouldn't except that his cake made us sick.   THE OWNER DOESN'T WANT TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR HIS PRODUCTS AND DOESN'T WANT TO LISTEN TO HIS CUSTOMERS.   WHAT A WAY TO RUN A BUSINESS.   Do yourselves a favour and go buy a custom cake any where but at San Remo Bakery.  I will not be returning to this place especially with an attitude like the owner has."}
{"text":"I ventured all the way over here (not close to where I live) on my way back from work downtown one day for the donuts they are well known for. They were sold out of a lot of them but still had a wide selection. This place was CRAMMED. Street parking was fine. I got a few donuts to go and also tried their gelato - was fine. Honestly, the donuts were nothing special. I come from a Russian household where we have high expectations for our dough and the filling, and this was just an ordinary donut. The only donuts I really eat are sufganiyot during Hannukah; those have a nice dough, lol."}
{"text":"I went in here on a Saturday morning and boy was it busy! Don't be discouraged by the long lines though because their service is very fast and organized. I purchased the lemon meringue donut and the coconut cream donut. Both were so fresh...they just melted in your mouth. I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Visited again today. Delicious. Such a varied menu that I try something new each time. I really like the deluxe grilled cheese sandwich. It is done on a panini grill on delicious bread with 2 kinds of cheese.  Tried a latte today. Loved the added chocolate with lots of froth.   My son had the honey garlic wings and roasted vegetables. The wings were a generous size and the whole meal was exceptionally delicious.   The store is better organized with an entry way. It must be good for maintaining room temperature, but it also keeps out the noise from traffic. It will be great when they can open their patio seats.   There was confusion by the coffee counter. A couple of signs could keep the coffee line from mixing with the gelato line.   I wish there was more seating space, especially now with street construction out front.    More space would also allow restrooms on the main floor. I make sure I find a restroom some other place so I don't have to manage that extra-long, steep, narrow stairway down to the restrooms.   I will be back every time I go to Etobicoke."}
{"text":"Surprising selection of all things baked. Croissants are some of the best I've had. Donuts look impressive but are only slightly above average in taste for me. Sandwiches are high quality and delicious. Fun place to visit. My only real complaint is about their cupcakes and cakes frosted not with buttercream but icing that tastes like vegetable shortening, artificial flavor and off-putting, disappointing."}
{"text":"I'm new to the neighborhood but even I know this place is a cornerstone in the community.  The place is almost always busy when I'm in there, and it's easy to taste why!  Fresh bread, pastries, cookies, pizza and Italian sandwiches."}
{"text":"My friend had his birthday catered from San remos,needless to say I was eating pasta al forno for a week straight and loved every single bite"}
{"text":"I ate there today for the 1st time, BUT not the last time! It was awesome, the servers were polite and friendly, the food was so filling, I could only eat half the sandwich, I overdid my take home sweet tooth but OMG the what I called the Mile High Lemon Meringue pie was so, so good, not the traditional pie crust more like a cookie crust. The donuts so fresh! and cheap. 6.99 for 1/2 Doz  I would definately share this place with anyone I encounter :)"}
{"text":"Donuts to DIE for! But make sure to special order them a couple days in advance - especially if taking them to an event/occasion - as they tend to sell out fairly early by lunch time!"}
{"text":"This bakery is amazing! I was so lost at first due to the enormous collection of goodies they have.. Sweet and savory, they have everything!  Their donuts are amazing, I don't think I'll ever go to Krispy creme again.. The bread collection is out of this world!  The normal sandwiches are ok but the focaccia ones are amazing!  The almonds croissant is oozing with almond paste! Mmmmmmmmm.. They also have an adjacent deli and cheese shop! And pizza dough + tomato sauce! It was my first visit and definitely not my last.. It's a must try!"}
{"text":"Wonderful gem of a place! Delicious Italian food made that day. It felt like I was back in Italy! Cannot go wrong with any of their food."}
{"text":"This place is amazing - the only negative thing is that it's hard to find parking during peak times.  I find myself craving their pizza, their gelato and their desserts all the time.   They have an amazing lemon meringue pie and their buns are so delicious especially when fresh!  I also love that they have a lot of staff working at all times so it's always really quick to get served.  I would highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Sanremo is the place cheat day dreams are made of! They take a lot of pride in what they do here and they do it well. It is impressive to see what a large volume and variety of items they make fresh here.   Always packed on the weekends, but since it is sectioned off into lines for deli, coffee, sandwiches/hot food, and bakery, you never wait too long. I love the sandwiches and pizza, each one I've tried is better than the last and I've tried a lot. The roast beef, Italian cold cut, and turkey sandwiches have fried onion on them, so good. They make great veggie pizzas, too. Recently had the eggplant and tomato pizza which was fantastic.   The bakery is to die for. They have racks full of fresh baked breads, pies, and tarts that are works of art. The bakery case houses donuts and other sweet treats. The apple fritter donut is popular and for good reason, extra crispy outside and pillowy warm inside.   For an authentic Italian bakery and deli, you won't find a better option than Sanremo. Just don't expect to eat light of you come here!"}
{"text":"San Remo may appear like just a regular bakery, but it is so much more.   They have different \"zones\" that serve everything from desserts, to fresh sandwiches, and even hot table items.    Excellent sandwiches and even better pizza."}
{"text":"Sanremo is not just a bakery, it's a coffee bar, deli, Italian hot table, sandwich shop and pizzeria.   The stars of the show for me are their amazing donuts. My favourite is their apple fritter, among the best I've ever had, and key lime, lemon meringue, red velvet and maple bacon donuts.   They have a massive selection of sandwiches, and many can easily feed two. Mortadella, roast beef, ham, turkey and salami are all on buns made fresh in house. They also bake bread, focaccia, pies, cakes and  pastries and are all delicious. Hot table too!  You won't be disappointed by this long standing Italian bakery, except for the long line ups and limited seating. But that all goes away when you bite into you selection!"}
{"text":"It was the day before Father's Day. I live in California, my father lives in Mississauga. I've already given him gift cards to all his favorite places, I need something new. Jump on Yelp and scout around for bakeries. Sanremo looks like a winner. Call them up, get a lovely young person on the phone who says \"Sure, we can set up a gift card for your father,\" and handles the whole thing. Saved! My father swings by to pick up his card and LOVES the place, a new favorite. Thanks Sanremo Bakery, and thanks Yelp Reviewers, I couldn't have done it without you!"}
{"text":"I had the veal sandwich with mushroom with my expectation soo high I was disappointed to find that my bread was soggy And not as flavorful as I expected. I did get 1 and 1/2 veal on mine... Veal  sauce overall... Overrated!"}
{"text":"This was my second time here for lunch. The selection of sandwiches is unbelievable, so many choices and so good. This time we headed to the hot food, still went for a sandwich, but I had the prime rib with grilled onions and hot peppers. So good! My friend had the brisket with onions and grilled sweet peppers. Both were served on a freshly baked bun. What a meal!"}
{"text":"5 starts for their doughnuts and pastries!  They have fabulous deli items and breads too, but the doughnuts....  I normally don't eat doughnuts, no one in my family eats donuts.  Many years ago I had a client in the area; they have the weekly doughnut-in-the-office system and that's when I discovered Sanremo.  I've bought so many boxes of their doughnuts and pastries for friends and families, if none of them remembers where I worked or what I did years ago, they always remember \"the client that is near the good doughnut place\".    They have wonderful pastries too - Sfogliatelle (flaky shell pastry filled with Ricotta cream), different types of cannoli, cookies.    Sweet memories."}
{"text":"It doesn't get better than Sanremo!   It's always crowded, but no wonder; there isn't an item I haven't enjoyed from there. Whether it's the cake, the pastries, the amazing giant sandwiches, or the delicious bread; it's all great!  And not too pricey! That's the confusing part.   The turnover of employees seem to be high, but it seems like a stressful place to work, so no wonder."}
{"text":"Just happen to go by at 2:45 PM to get buns, meats, etc for my sons 11th bday party.   As I was cashing out I noticed a sign for Gelato Donut Panini April 19th.   Free for 1st 50 customers at 3PM.  Hell, I'm staying.   It was their launch!  My ticket was 35.    What's a GDP?  Exactly that!  Take a donut, cut it in half, scoop in your fav. Gelato flavour, donut grill press it and sprinkle with icing sugar.   Enjoy right away!      Tried the Bacio GDP!  It was pretty awesome!     BTW, they kept giving the numbers out.   Way surpassing 50 as the owner is just awesome that way.   He was personally taking the GDP orders and  scooped the gelato into the donuts before another pressed it and added the icing sugar.    Sorry forgot your name.   You rock San Remo!       Keep it up!   5 stars and beyond !"}
{"text":"I dropped by this place the day I found out about it - an amazingly-reviewed bakery that sells cannolis and it's on my way home from work?  That's what I call a done deal.  I should say right now that I've never had a cannoli, but I've always thought they looked delicious and have been eager to try them.  I picked up three pastries to share, two filled with custard, and one cannoli with ricotta.  They were $2.75 each.  Now I know I haven't bought them before, but I think that's fairly expensive.  I did a little research and found that many places sell them for under $2, but I'll have to try them to compare.    Both pastries were good, but they didn't hit my sweet tooth in that \"I MUST have more!\" kinda way.  On the other hand, my SOs face lit up when he tried it.  So looks like a personal taste thing.  I still want to try the cannolis at a couple of other places to compare, but I don't think it'll be a mainstay dessert for me - and I might try Sanremo again for different desserts, because they had plenty that looked very enticing!"}
{"text":"Let me tell you about Sanremo Bakery. While they might not have the baguette or vienna sticks that I'm looking for they do have some very nice breads, a great hot table and some donuts to die for. I've always been a sucker for lemon and they have a lemon filled donut that reminds me of what I used to get as a kid.   Or how about a donut panini? We're talking a donut with some gelato in the middle, a moment in the panini press and warm nutella drizzled over top. Maybe a nice espresso to go along with it.   I mentioned the hot table didn't I? Lunch will run you around $10 and that's usually a big old sandwich like veal or chicken parm with a salad on the side plus a drink. You can't beat that and the portions are big enough to share.   The parking lot can get a little crowded especially on a Saturday or Sunday morning but a little patience works. Or see if you can find a spot on one of the side streets and walk off some of the extra calories."}
{"text":"By far the best bakery in the city. From the bread to the desserts, the cafe, the deli to the delicious gelato. The most amazing place to go for all craving from salty, savoury to sweet. Amazing people, amazing atmosphere. The highlight of my day!"}
{"text":"This place is dangerous!!!!!!! Once you step into this bakery all you want to do is eat everything they have on display!!! My fiance and I enjoy coming here for breakfast and buying their fresh loaves of bread for the week! The shop is cut into 3 sections: deli/produce, hot foods/cafe/fresh breads, and a huge section of fresh baked desserts and pastries. Everything is made in house and super fresh.  The sandwiches that are pre made here are huge!! I always opt for the capres sandwhich and the amount of mozzarella they give you is ridiculous. They will panini press your sandwhich and that does wonders. Their baked goods are so fresh and you see them coming out with more and more as the morning goes. However if you were to come in the afternoon... most of the fresh baked bread will be gone! Their cheese bread loaf is to die for... you may think only the exterior of the bread (the crust) would have cheese but when you cut right inside.. you have cheese all over melted I side as well.   They are super known for their doughnuts and can get very busy when everyone on a saturday/sunday morning want. Not your average tummies donut. Super fluffy and the flavours are amazing.  We also tried their Portuguese tart and they are so good when you eat them fresh.    Staff are also super friendly and willing to help when needed. Just be sure you go early or else all the good stuff will be gone!!!! They only take credit card if it's 10$ and up (but tbh... that is quite easy to do when everything here is so amazing!!!!)"}
{"text":"My favourite bakery in the GTA. From the hot table to the donuts; everything is made so fresh. The pasta is my favourite off the hot tables, I can't leave without a Nutella latte; and what's a latte without a cannoli or a donut?! Love this place"}
{"text":"What an experience!   After years of traveling (and eating) in Italy, this was the first time I felt that same excitement in my hometown. The atmosphere was great, with shoppers excited to pick out their sandwich, hot food, and baked delights!  The sandwiches were all prepared fresh on exciting, traditional breads (tomato and onion focaccia, need I say more?) and the selection of products was vast. We went around 1PM on a Friday and were disappointed that many of the donut flavours were sold out, but the clerk serving us seemed surprised by this too! Perhaps busier than usual.   We can't wait to go back and try something new each time!  Tip: Park at the first spot you see, don't hold out hope for something closer! It can be quite busy."}
{"text":"My dad introduced this place to me and I'm so glad he did! The hot sandwiches are amazing. The pastries look and taste just like home. Coming from an Italian family, this place's food felt like home."}
{"text":"It costs money because its amazing. Its a luxury to eat foods and desserts so good so do not expect Tim Horton prices. HOWEVER if you realize its cheaper than most independents you will allow your self into incredible  experiences in food.   Its well worth the trip. Make sure to go in March for the Zeppole it would be a crime not to"}
{"text":"Just WOW.  I found this place on BlogTO's list of best pumpkin pies. I can attest, this place has mind blowing pumpkin pie. I bought a pie for my partner (who had been craving pumpkin pie for weeks) and a a 10\" pumpkin tart for a Thanksgiving party.  I ordered on Thursday to pick up for Sunday morning (before Thanksgiving Monday). The tart is $20 and the pie is $7, and honestly they are so worth the money, especially the pie. I went in on Sunday. I don't live anywhere near this area, but it's very accessible by TTC. AND IT WAS HAPPENING! People were coming in to pick up baked goods for Thanksgiving, people were eating, people were coming in for pastries. It was so packed. But the staff were totally prepared and on top of everything.  I was in and out in no time. Very efficient service. And the goods...!!! The tart was a big hit for Thanksgiving. It had a bit of chocolate to it and was so pretty. Just the right bit of sweetness to it. The pie was divine. So creamy. I just wanted to keep eating it forever!  I am looking forward to more baked goods, but also just a casual visit to check out the rest of the bakery. BlogTO definitely got this one right!"}
{"text":"pretty busy but great sandwiches to go, new deli meat section and good for a coffee! I would suggest adding more seating in a cafeteria style! or seating closer to sandwich side so no one has to carry trays around."}
{"text":"Amazing bakery in the area with lots of great options. For more variety go earlier in the day. The gelato is awesome and they also have an iced red tea which is worth a try!"}
{"text":"These pastries are ammmaaazzzing! You may not get exactly what you came in for (donuts disappear so quickly) however, with the 686467 other choices, you won't be disappointed with the abundance of options and decadent flavors available!"}
{"text":"One of the best Italian bakeries around. I have yet to try any of their hot dishes but their dessert section is so tempting. I came in to pick up my sfoglia cake and walked out with that and a box of pastries. The almond cookies and cannolis were my favourite. The sfoglia cake was good but there was too much custard."}
{"text":"Went Sunday before Halloween.  Placed order for seasonal online. Went at 830 and pickup was quick. Already paid. Lots of stuff for walkins though. Picked up cold cuts, bread and rolls and a couple more pastries. Cappuccino of course. Was much quicker with preorder. Great idea. I'll use it in future."}
{"text":"Hands down my absolute favourite bakery in Toronto.  I have not had one bad thing from here:  Pizza: Amazing Sandwiches: Amazing Salads: Amazing Pastries: Amazing Cheesecake: Amazing Coffee: Amazing Donuts: AMAZING   If for nothing else, come here for a donut (or 7). They are fantastic, very well made, but be warned, they go quickly, so go early if you want a donut or you may have to settle (haha, please) for a delicious rocky road bar, or other sweet treat.   I love you Sanremo, never change!"}
{"text":"Endless options ! Freshly baked goods ! This is a must if you live in the etobicoke area or are simply passing through. The prosciutto lunch sandwich on a soft croissant was absolutely to die for. Would most definitely return to this spot. Easy to see from the street and lots of parking on the road"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. Baked goods, doughnuts, cooking products - everything is top notch. I like to buy the pizza dough and rest of my products here to make homemade pizza."}
{"text":"The best donuts in the world! I have so many favourite donuts, but my ultimate fav is the red velvet donut. Their donuts are soft and pillowy with amazing flavour. I've ordered many times for parties and everyone always asks where I get them. Great customer service too."}
{"text":"I originally came here to get a dessert to bring over to a friends house for dinner. It was my first time in the bakery and the selection combined w/ the amount of people was overwhelming so I asked for assistance.  Someone that worked there suggested I get the peach/coconut coffee cake that she promised me was their top seller and sold out everyday. I, of course raved about it to everyone at the dinner party and it ended tasting like your regular cake - very much oversold. However, aside from cake, I picked up some focaccia pizza for lunch and had an espresso and they were both excellent! The bakery gets BUSY, so be prepared for that. The service was excellent and I was impressed with their hot table and pastry selection.   Will definitely be back here!"}
{"text":"It's a little bit like an adventure in here. It's fun, and it smells like heaven! Lots to discover, and lots of obstacles as well.   I had trouble finding the line to pay, but luckily staff was helpful and clear! Plus they were quick!   Lots of bread and lots of sweets when you enter and go left. To the right are the meats and cheese!   The pistachio cannoli is UNBELIEVABLE!!!!! The filling was so smooth! I don't like sweets and this was the perfect amount of flavour and sweetness."}
{"text":"Every time I've come to this place, it has been super busy. They've got baked breads, pastries, prepared food, a cafe, and a deli. There's something for everyone. I've only tried their baked goods here and I have not been disappointed with anything that I've tried. My favourite items are probably their donuts which sell out pretty fast. The donuts here aren't overly sweet and the filling isn't overwhelming either. My favourite one has to be their pumpkin cream cheese, which has a fantastic light and airy filling.   There is parking right outside the bakery as well as along the side streets nearby. Although I've never had too much trouble finding a spot, sometimes it does get quite full.   Service is quite fast, they run by a ticket system much like deli counters. Only issue I had was when I was told my donut was a Boston cream, but it just turned out to be a non filled chocolate dip donut."}
{"text":"I used to work there when I was in high school. The baked goods are truly delicious and the variety of pastries, breads, buns is incredible."}
{"text":"I'm on the fence about San Remo. I have actually gone there a few times and walked out not having found anything that appealed to me. That's probably because it's a bakery and they sell out in the morning so if you arrive later in the day there are slim pickings. For instance their donuts which are great if not a bit heavy-handed in there sweetness and size, sellout and I was there in the afternoon and there wasn't a single one left. Also a lot of their desserts and baked goods are the type that look good but aren't necessarily the tastiest things you want to have again. They have a good cranberry walnut bread however none of their breads on the racks are ever labelled and I have accidentally picked up and purchased the wrong kind, now I have to ask the ladies at the counter but they never seem 100% sure either. The hot table items always seem to be popular I've tried a few wet meat sandwiches and various items but nothing was so good that I wanted to eat it all or order it again."}
{"text":"They got all the desserts you'd want.  Anyone who's craving and in the area must come visit"}
{"text":"love going on a Saturday morning. Grab a coffee and 6 fresh buns.  My daughter eats the warm middle part of the bread .......lol. Every chance I get I will go"}
{"text":"My family and I were on our way out of Toronto but we were craving some baked goods for the road. Then I found this popular place on yelp. When we entered we were overwhelmed. The place is a little market with different stations for things like deli sandwiches, ice cream, and the bakery. There are also stands full of fresh bread that keep getting emptied and refilled. People, I'm assuming locals, bustled around knowing exactly what they wanted.   We took a number and got in the quick-moving line for the bakery. I forgot to get her name but the woman helping us was very helpful. As I said we were overwhelmed; everything looked delicious. She gave us recommendations and was patient with our indecisiveness. She even saved us a few dollars by suggesting a half dozen donuts instead of just four donuts. Another woman helped us earlier and she was kind and helpful, too, so service in general was excellent.  We got donuts and cannoli and they were so delicious. Perfectly flaky and not too sweet cannoli. The donuts were fluffy and warm. I'm so glad I found this place."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is so huge and filled with so much fresh goodies! Breads, baked goods, delicatessen, donuts, pies, sandwiches.   You can sit outside and have the goodies with coffee, but seating is very limited.  It is very busy here, but you get served really quickly.  To get donuts, you have to take a ticket and they call you, so it's pretty organized.  The food is inclusive of the tax, which is great.  A dozen specialty donuts for $19.99. The downside, there is limited street parking."}
{"text":"I popped into Sanremo during my lunch hour at work and man, you walk in and are hit with a huge wall of \"OMFG WHAT IS THAT SMELL PUT IT IN MY MOUTH!!\".  They are pretty much a lunch time diners paradise with hot food, freshly baked bread and a bakery desert section to die for: I hear tell that their donuts are the best in town though I haven't had one myself.  Since I did bring my lunch on this excursion (yes, lame I know, as all my friends pointed out repeatedly between mouthfuls of whatever goodness they were mowing down), I opted to bring home one of their jalapeno and olive baguettes.  Which, by the way, was EXCELLENT.   If I haven't said it enough in my other reviews of the area - I hate Mimico, but with places like this popping up, I may just hate it a little less."}
{"text":"Wow .....what a great little Italian market. So well organized and the service was quick. Much larger than it looks. There's a deli, fresh hot sandwiches so big you have to share, gelato and fresh bakery. I only came for the dessert with my coworker.   You must try there filled donuts. I bought the raspberry filled and Nutella filled and they both were amazing. Filled so much there almost bursting! I also got there strawberry tart but I ate it before I could even take a picture. If you have a sweet tooth there variety of brownies will sure satisfy it. I definitely will be returning.  Only downside is street parking is hard to find."}
{"text":"As my colleague and I explore the Etobicoke area, we stumble upon this Italian bakery shop. Family owned since 1969, SanRemo expanded from a small bakery to a three size shop. Every item is truly a work of art. As we entered the store, there's a huge line up for the lunch special. For $7.99, you get two choices of either a sandwich (value at $5.99), a soup and a salad.  I've ordered a Ham Panini with a Creamy Garden Vegetable soup. As we waited for our meal, batches of pizza were displayed next to us. We decided to come back the next day for it. The panini was well crusted and was filled with thinly cut ham. The soup includes broccoli, bell pepper and lima beans. It was refreshing.  I've bought a Mediterranean Pizza with a Meat Lasagna the next day. The pizza was coated with lots of cheese, making the bread slightly softer. The lasagna was deliciously made, as it wasn't too dry.  After our lunch, we had to check-out their pastry section for dessert. SanRemo has a large selection of cake and donuts. I've bought half a dozen assorted donuts and a Chocolate Babbka to share with my colleagues. In addition, I got myself a Raspberry Trifle Shortcake."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  I needed a cake with a rather adult image printed on it - they did it with no issues or questions. Thank you all - the cake was brilliant and the image on top really made the night."}
{"text":"We have been regulars at this establishment for years. We were so happy to see them get so successful as to expand the way they did.    Our favourite thing at the hot table were their sandwiches...I say WERE because ever since the expansion, their sandwiches have gone from amazing filled with great ingredients to lame versions of what they used to be. What a shame. We don't go there for lunch anymore- not worth the long line ups.  Now the sweet table is still and remains to be an impressive selection of sweet lovely things.   Their breads and special sticks continue to be top notch."}
{"text":"Just had my first experience with Sanremo Bakery. Incredible! I was able to sample a few of there donuts,  which were all delicious, but the Nutella donut completely knocked me off my feet.  I live out in Markham and I would definitely make a side trip the next time I pass by Etobicoke to sample more of there delicious baked goods and savory dishes."}
{"text":"This place is a neighborhood gem.  Pro:  Giant Sandwiches that taste great and reasonable cost. They have hot foods, sandwiches, baked goods, deserts, gelato... Reasonable price on just about everything. I had the roast beef sandwich and it was awesome: bread was not too bready but flaky, kinda like croissant, fried onions, and beef was good quality. My friend had the veal parm sandwich and gelato and she loved them both.  Con:  Way people line up was very messy. Maybe store can have a better way of organizing, in terms of how people line up.   Verdict:  Highly recommend this place.  I look forward to going back there again."}
{"text":"I would like to thank Sanremo bakery for making the best cannolis in the city....a little too good actually. I sometimes sit at work thinking..\"how can I get one of those cannolis?\" Then that's all I can think of.lol now they also make good bread and if your stopping in for lunch, the pizza is pretty good too. Btw they're closed on Mondays :("}
{"text":"I love this place. People come from like over the city to get their hands on the donuts (you better plan on going early to get your hands on the ones you want). They are so much more than donuts. Eclairs, cookies, sweets...all delicious. The savoury side is amazing as well. Couscous salad and grilled chicken breast, all types of daily specials, hot sandwiches. One of the current household favourites is the tuna on a croissant. In the summertime gelato is a must!! You basically can't go wrong with anything you choose."}
{"text":"1st time trying their donut and its really good .. sweet cravings satisfied, the line up is unbelievable but fast service though. For people going w/ their car, parking is tiny bit hard,just got lucky that when i get there another car is leaving,park in the side street."}
{"text":"Drove all the way from East York to check this place out and what a major disappointment. Staff are all uninterested bored teenage girls who act like they hate being there and don't want to hold down a part-time job. I had to almost make a scene just to get the attention of the three girls at the sandwich station. They asked if we wanted the sandwiches heated up which was good but when we got them they were still cold in the middle and not very warm as if the panini press was on the lowest setting. Not good.  We then headed over to the deli area where about 5 or 6 staff members were so busy slicing meat they never once turned around to ask what we wanted. I'm 6'5\" so I'm not easy to miss. Plus we were the only ones in the deli area so it's not like they were busy helping other customers. So strange. After a few minutes I just blurted out \"can we please get some help over here\" they looked startled that an actual customer needed assistance.   I get it, the place is busy but instead of hiring 20 minimum wage high school students who don't give a damn about your business or customer service, why don't you hire less staff who are paid well and  who can do a good job and want to be there...someone not in highschool perhaps.   Needless to say we are NEVER going back. We'll stick to the Italian grocery stores and bakeries who provide competent and friendly service. Forno Cultura and Sud Forno are WAY WAY better and closer to real Italian food anyway. Bread to meat ratio in most of the sandwiches is way off. Google all'antico vinaio sandwich shop and you'll see what a REAL Italian sandwich looks like."}
{"text":"Wow. Here I was worried what I'd do for lunch!  This place is a machine of foody goodness. So many perfect options in sandwiches, pastries and breads. At one point it was literally shoulder-to-shoulder throughout the entire place, and it's not a small place either.  But, you may ask, how's the espresso? After all, no Italian bakery is worth a visit unless the espresso is good! Good news! It is.  Definitely coming back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"It is delicious, don't get me wrong. But in my experience almost every single person working there that we interacted with were actually downright rude.   We had never been before and had various questions, all of which were met with indifference and exasperation. I guess they are used to the locals who know exactly what they want. It was pretty off-putting to me and the BF though.  Ended up ordering a veal sandwich to share which was absolutely delicious. The veal was tender and not tough at all. Freshly baked bread held up nicely in the sandwich. Sauce was literally finger licking good (We liked the sandwich so much we ordered take out pizza, which was equally tasty)!  For sweets, you are really spoiled for choice here! Its hard to decide. We settled on a whoopie pie and a key lime doughnut. Both were so so so good. I still think about that little pie to this day lol it was a game changer. Accompanied our desserts with tasty coffees; a latte and cappuccino, which were both lovely.  Overall, the food is awesome. The service kind of really stinks. Go with a thick skin and empty tummy and you will be just fine ;)"}
{"text":"This place does have good food, I bought my staff birthday cakes there on several occasions and also donuts for them as a treat but San Remo have the rudest most obnoxious cashiers I've ever encountered. I am a pleasant friendly person, I've given this place a try on numerous occasions and always met with the same sullen, rude cashiers. I'll never go back. They've had their chance."}
{"text":"BEST VEGGIE LASAGNA! Their hot table food is amazing. I'm vegetarian and there are a lot of options for me.  We get catered lunches for work from here and there's always something for everyone!"}
{"text":"Amazing baked goods and great coffee. Always busy but well staffed and pretty friendly. Not open Mondays. Dang it."}
{"text":"I've recently frequented this place.  I just can't get enough of their hot table.  They've also recently done a renovation and expanded their space.  Today I came to have an early lunch and get some bread and cold cuts.  I'm not gonna get too much into service because it's quick and efficient as a necessity because of how busy they are.  Restaurant Space:  They've expanded it but the configuration is still a bit off.  The deli is now in its own space.  they expanded the hot table.  It's a bit more spacious.  There is still insufficient seating space.  i kinda wish they expanded that too.  However, be wary, it's still not accessible for wheelchairs or strollers.  The entrance is floor level with automatic doors but deli is 3 steps up and exit still has a step down and no automatic doors.  Food:  They now have ready made panini sandwiches the size of your head ranging from $5.99-8.99.  They have more pizzas to choose from and the hot table is still as awesome as before.  Today we had a veggie pizza, a porchetta sandwich and a donut.   I was the first one to order from the porchetta that just came out of the oven and it was exquisite!  At first I thought, I wish they had some type of aioli to go on the bread thinking it might be dry but it wasn't.  The pizza wasn't amazing, a little doughy but pretty good.  And of course the donut was good, also not amazing but not bad.  I took out a foccaccia and a baguette with olives and hot pepper.  Careful with the hot pepper because it certainly is hot.  Foccaccia is a great deal at $5/loaf and beautiful as always.  I highly recommend this place and try to trek on a Friday to try their porchetta sandwich!"}
{"text":"Donuts will make you the talk of the party and the food quality is top notch.   It's popular and busy because it's great  Parking is difficult due to lack of space but worth the required effort"}
{"text":"I come here almost every weekend with my mom or my boyfriend. It is a staple if you live in Etobicoke. Great food, Great selections, Great price, Great everything! It gets really busy during brunch/lunch time during weekends but weekdays are fine. Everything always sells out before closing so better to get there early if you can :)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend doesn't like traditional cakes but lovesssss donuts so what is better than a jumbo birthday donut? Sanremo was helpful and courteous throughout the entire process, from ordering to special customization to pick up. Despite its jumbo size, the donut is true in its taste and texture compared to its regular sized counterpart. Will definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Very efficient operation. You can pay in the middle or pay where you get your coffee (this can be a little confusing, though). Americanos are great, as well as croissants and cakes. We had an Italian cake made special for a relative's birthday and it was perfectly done and within a short time frame.  Parking is limited (few spots on the street and green P spots on the surrounding streets). All in all, great quality coffee place but definitely always busy!"}
{"text":"I just can't get enough of this place. Awesome food and people.  Their focaccia sandwiches are the best! And of course, their doughnuts are ridiculously good too. Strudels and pies are amazing as well. All items in this bakery are very reasonably priced. I love, love this place. I have tried three other Italian bakeries in the GTA with more than 4 stars, and none of them came even close to Sanremo. Thank you for being consistently good!!!!!"}
{"text":"Their fresh sandwiches/prepared foods are delicious and their Bakery items are amazing. The apple fritter donuts and their butter tarts are my personal favourites.  My only complaints would be that they're simply too busy and things are always hectic. Parking can also be a bit of a pain to find. The store is always impeccably clean and the staff is always friendly. Prices are very fair. Great place to go on a Saturday afternoon if it weren't always packed.  I don't live in the neighborhood any more but try to stop by whenever I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Everything here is good from deli food/sandwiches to their cakes, donuts, bread, pastries. Their donuts are THE BEST compared to other top Toronto donuts places. My favourite!!"}
{"text":"I used to go to San Remo Bakery years ago while in school at Humber College. I recently moved back to the area and began to frequent it again. The food has always been delicious but I have to say in the recent months I have had the absolute worst customer service experiences. The staff have been rude, either not acknowledging the customer or acting as if they are doing you a favour. When innocent mistakes have occurred there has been little understanding and they have been rude and insulting. For now, I am taking my business elsewhere. There are plenty of other establishments that treat their customers with courtesy and respect."}
{"text":"I accidentally stumbled upon Sanremo Bakery in Mimico Village today. I'd heard of the place, but didn't go out of my way to visit it, as there are many near my home that so very good. (I live in Bloor West Village) With my 3-year old son in tow, I planned to make a quick stop for a coffee and maybe a treat. (Is anything not quick when you have kids with you?)  It was just after 9am on a Friday morning. As we walked south along Royal York Road from where I parked my car, there was a nice elderly gentleman who was sitting on the patio enjoying his morning coffee and newspaper. To me, small patios in front of food establishments that are clean and filled with people are always a good sign. (Kind of a Euro-thing I wish Toronto had way more of, I think.) He smiled at my boy and said \"Good morning\" and then even gave my son a few breadcrumbs to fee the little birds that were on the street. Cute. It was like this man knew it was our first time at SanRemo and he went out of his way to welcome us.  When we entered, the first thing that caught my eye was the line for the \"Coffee & Gelato.\" Another good sign. It told me that the coffee was probably good and that folks were willing to wait in a long line to get their morning cup. I also noticed the sparkling and fancy cappuccino maker they had too. The baristas were hard at work. We walked past the cheeses, deli meats, hot table (is 9am too early for a veal sandwich?), and stopped at the fresh bread and buns that were being unloaded from a cart and onto the shelves for picking. What's better than fresh bread? I picked up a few buns and dreamed of the sandwich I was going to make with it at lunchtime.  They had a a row of about 6 or 7 racks of fresh pastries: croissants, scones, pies, breads, danishes...this was too much. I wanted one of each. I filled a paper bag of a few samples and headed to the nearby glass case of other goodies...but not before I quickly picked up a package of butter tarts first. (Hey, it's research!) I had to run after my son, who I'd lost to the glass counter with cupcakes, cakes, cookies and doughnuts. I knew I was in trouble. Did they have shopping carts in there? (No) It was then I decided that I'd have to come back when my kids weren't with me. Mama needs more time to really appreciate this store. I got my little guy a sprinkled cupcake and for me, a sugar twist doughnut...but wait, what was that lady bringing out on a tray from the back? Fresh from the oven cinnamon buns. I picked one up for the husband, as he likes them more than I do.  Ty and I sat down for our treats. The sugar twist was very good. But let me just take a peek at this cinnamon bun, as I overheard about 5 people ordering them after I bought mine. I looked in the paper bag and took a nice whiff. Hmmm. Not bad. One little nibble couldn't hurt, Jeremy shares everything with me.  And that was the end of the cinnamon bun. Sweet Heavens, that was good. Do they fry them or something?????  I had come into the bakery for a coffee, a browse-around, and a treat for my son. I came home with a belly full of sweets and a bag full of treats. I plan on going back tomorrow."}
{"text":"Oh man, thank goodness I don't live in this neighbourhood!  The donuts are easily the best that I've ever had!    I don't know how much a dozen donuts costs at Timmie's but it was about $13 here.  For the quality,  it's well worth any price difference!   I"}
{"text":"The only bad thing that can be said about Sanremo is ...it's gonna make you fatter!  Love everything here."}
{"text":"Madhouse! Pretty overwhelming for a first timer. Staff says the weekdays are a little bit better. Crowded and noisy, different counters for different food items (coffee, donuts, hot table, sandwiches, deli). You can pay at some counters but not at all: for example, the hot table will give you a ticket and you can pay at the cash registers in the middle of the room. You can order and pay for your coffee at the donut counter but then you have to go to the coffee counter to pick it up. Had to go to 4 different counters to order and pay for my donuts, sfogliatella, latte and breakfast pizza.   The most appealing and best tasting item was the lemon meringue donut: light and perfectly sweet. The latte was weak, apple fritter needed more spicing, the sfogliatella's edges were hard, and the edges of the pizza were hard as well. I'm sure everything would have tasted better baked fresh out of the oven.   My aversion to crowds and their crazy ordering/payment system will keep me away but if I'm in the area when it first opens, I would be willing to try more of their items."}
{"text":"Bought a dozen donuts plus an apple pie. The donuts are soft and pillowy in texture. My personal favourite is the nutella donut. The bakery is very generous in the fillings of the donut.   Its a nice donut that's different than the ones you get at krispy kreme/tim hortons, a dozen are a bit pricy but its worth it given the size of each donut is 1.5x the size of a krispy kreme alternative."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are nice and the donuts are awesome.  The only problem is that the paninis were slightly cold in the middle, they need to press them longer.  Limited seating but a nice small patio outside.    overall very nice."}
{"text":"I like this place very much  Close to where I live so we go there for a quick bite or buy some bread and dessert  Love the variety and there hot table  A great place for a take out, coffee  Only thing is that the work only till 7 pm, would love if extended till 8 pm"}
{"text":"Really great and fresh baked goods, bread and hot lunches. The donuts are some of the best in the city.   The only thing I'm not 100% crazy about are the cakes. They're good, just not as good as some of the other pastries and gelato.  It's not very easy to get to on transit but if you live in the neighbourhood it's amazing."}
{"text":"Well done donuts! Those who like baked stuff must come here! By far the best I have tried!"}
{"text":"I have tried San Remo before (doughnuts), but first time inside this weekend.  Was there around 4 and luckily there was parking around the corner.   It's like a small market. Has coffee bar, cheese, deli stations, pizza/sandwich, bread and desserts and a sitting area.  We picked up some desserts and they were all very good. GF raved about the Baklava. Brownie and strawberry tart? were all very nice too.   Unfortunately there was not any bread left,  as I wanted to try.   There were constantly people in/out and lineups at dessert and sandwich/pizza station.  Pizza looked good too, next time I'm definitely trying the pizza/sandwich as well.  For doughnuts, you have to order 24hr ahead. Don't know if there is ever any leftovers to sell by the pieces, but definitely worth the try."}
{"text":"My friends and I visited Sanremo Bakery for breakfast on our way back to the States from Toronto. It was well worth the trip. It's a large bakery and deli, piping hot fresh donuts, coffee and sandwiches. We got a large box of assorted donuts that we selected, and got some sandwiches. Everything was absolutely delicious. Donuts were crisp, fluffy, and perfectly sweet! Dont miss out! You definitely wont regret indulging in the donuts."}
{"text":"Loooove this place. Pizza slices and stuffed breads are amazing. Great take-away antipasto bar. Fabulous selection of italian cheeses, including harder to find varieties. But what I come for most often is their excellent pizza dough. I also notice they sell cake yeast if you're into making your own dough."}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite bakery in town!! Amazing friendly staff! Everything that is made and sold here is the best!! The Gelato, the desserts,pastries and coffee! That's aside from their affordable over sized sandwiches and hot lunches!!! I ordered my son's Baptism cake from here and even though I had a super large dessert table, the cake was the first to go!! Love them!"}
{"text":"great set up, nice family staff vibe.. food is QUALITY, decent prices (meatball sandwich, really good!!). excellent coffee and fresh bakery.. a REAL PLUS to living in the west end."}
{"text":"Often stop in for veal on a bun or slice of pizza from the hot table (along with a Brio.)   If you don't gave time for holiday baking you can order cookies in advance.   Also, there Zeppole Italian Donuts / Doughnuts are great for St Joseph day on March 19."}
{"text":"This place is pricy I will admit, but I would say it is worth it for special occasions. The cupcakes were delicious, they even made me a little chocolate sign that said happy birthday for me!"}
{"text":"Best bakery in the GTA?! Definitely a contender. Donuts, brownies, and any baked goods at the West-end institution are to die for.   Apparently, they have a mean hot table, with staples including lasagna, veal parm, etc. Will have to try it out next time.   You can't go wrong at Sanremo Bakery. 48 years in business for a reason.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We got a special donut dough with whipped cream layer and chocolate on the top ... this is the best of all what we bought... it is a big place and there are lots of interesting items that we would go back to try something else.  My boyfriend loved their mocha slice cake , but I dont like my vanilla cake ..   the butter tart is very very good...  The parking around that area is free along the street  ."}
{"text":"Amazing hot table. Always go for the combo meal, it is your best value by far. The pizza is just OK. The donuts are incredible, with my favorite by far being the apple fritters. The butter tarts are a close second to the Apple Factory for the best butter tarts in Ontario. The wait staff is a bit iffy. The female wait staff can be a bit, well, bitchy. Never go after 4 if you are going for the warm food table, as it will be a shadow of its glory during the normal lunch hours."}
{"text":"Amazing! Downtown quality in the Etobicoke area . My husband loves the lemon cheesecake and was his birthday treat for this year. Great selection of breads and fresh food aswell"}
{"text":"Very good donuts and bread.  The pies were a bit on the sweet side.  They are hit and miss on what they have.  I have been in several times and they had no donuts or hot food available sometimes."}
{"text":"Just delicious! The doughnuts are super fantastic, the hot food counter is amazing and the sandwiches are to die for."}
{"text":"Right now I'm probably on a sugar high but I am sooo happy. I just went to Sanremo Bakery for the first time and the place was packed!! When you first  arrive it's hard to miss because there are people crawling everywhere! It's actually hard to even find a parking spot  Upon entering all you see and smell are delicious baked goods. Sandwiches piled inches high with meet, elaborately decorated gelato, rack upon racks of croissants and cakes and other tasty treats.   With yesterday being international donut day Sanremo had special edition kinder bueno donuts so I had to try them. In order to get the donuts you had to take a number so that you can go to the counter. I was not disappointed the donuts kinder bueno donuts were 3.99 but oh so beautiful. They also had peach schnapps donut and a beer battered donut. I paid $41 for 12 donuts in total but it was totally worth it."}
{"text":"All the ladies were nice and friendly. There was a selection of apparel we were interested in--their uniquely designed shirts and requested for different sizes. They assisted us in a timely manner. I didn't even talk about the food yet!  Food was expertly crafted. Canoli had the perfect amount of flakiness/crisp/cream powder taste. If I could brand a slogan--proportionate texture & taste! Will definitely be looking to return!"}
{"text":"The veal sandwich was pretty light on the veal compared to how other restaurants make it. Delicious pies."}
{"text":"I love their sandwiches! They are mouth watering just by the looks of it! The sandwich is also tasteful and they serve a really good expresso after or an Italian ice cream or both :-)"}
{"text":"Update, this place still blows. Always a thousand excuses as to why they have no donuts. Clearly they are not making enough, bunch of amateurs if after all these years they still can't make appropriate stock"}
{"text":"With the in-depth reviews that I've been writing for other donut places, realized I should probably add a little more to my review. What makes San Remo the best donuts available every day in Toronto? Several factors. Light, fluffy, delicious dough - these donuts taste good and have great mouth feel even if you don't eat the toppings. Almost never greasy. The toppings and fillings enhance the experience of eating the donut, they don't overwhelm it. These are classic donuts, not gimmicky lame hipster fried dough. You won't find a $5 hunk of fried dough here covered in bullshit and champagne gummy bears, just a damn fine chocolate sprinkle for a very reasonable price.    My ranking of San Remo flavours:  1. Chocolate Sprinkle. You can't go wrong with this. Everyone loves them, and they are just about perfect. Occasionally they have vanilla sprinkle also, but chocolate sprinkle is just #1, the absolute best.  2. Chocolate Coconut. Perfect texture. The Coconut is just awesome. 3. Cinnamon Twist or Sugar Twist - Classic and simple. All donut places should make these, be suspicious if they don't - it means they need heavy glazes to keep their donuts from drying out.  4. Maple - Excellent maple dip, just delicious. 5. Chocolate Dip - See numbers 1 & 2. Why you would want this without sprinkles or coconut I don't know, but yeah, it's damn good on its own too. 6. Lemon Filled - Filling is a lemon pudding, not a lemon curd - thicker, more substantial. Very satisfying.  7. Lemon Meringue - Like Lemon Filled, but with fluff on top. Not really meringue, more like fluff. This is not a bad thing. 8. Cinnamon Bun - Good. Very good.  Donuts I do not order here  Maple Bacon - Again, this is not an artisan donut place, so this is not a thing to order. The bacon is just regular bacon, in chunks that are much too large. The bacon is not cooked crispy, it's just soft and fatty and I think it's really gross. I like maple bacon donuts with the bacon more in artisan bacon bit form - far better texture than just a hunk of cold bacon fat. Yuck.Fave maple bacon in Toronto would be Beast.    Nutella - Huge pet peeve of mine - DO NOT CALL SOMETHING NUTELLA UNLESS YOU ARE MAKING IT WITH PURE, UNADULTERATED NUTELLA. They do not use Nutella for these, it's some other kind of hazelnut spread, and it's mixed with something else for more of a hazelnut pudding type texture. FAIL. If you want a Nutella donut, go get a Nutella Bomba at Amico Chef - filled to perfection with pure sweet Nutella goodness.   Other filled donuts: I'm not a Boston Cream person, just not my thing. I used to sometimes order coconut filled, but it now tastes too chemically for me. Other filled's - too gimmicky. Red velvet - just no.   Half dozen is $8.99  Dozen is $16.99  Other food at San Remo is outstanding. Excellent pizza and sandwiches, everything from the hot table is great too. And if you ever see a Beef Brisket panini available, get it. :) Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Love it.  What more can I say. Great espresso, delicious pastries and food . Can't wait for the expansion to be completed."}
{"text":"The pizza is delicious and their veal sandwiches are super tender and tasty. Make sure you don't go later in the day because the selection isn't that great. Lunch time is best."}
{"text":"This was my second trip to Sanremo.  Ugh, I always just want everything but I also don't want to go broke.  This time around I decided to get a slice of red velvet cake, a cannoli, and a baklava for my friend.  I really wanted a slice of pizza from the hot table but it looked like they were all out.  We came at the \"dinner time, after work\" hour, so a lot of things had already run out.  They only had a selection of about 4-5 donut flavours left as well.  Which I didn't really mind because that's less of a chance of me going broke here lol.  I've gotten the small spaghetti in meat sauce in the past and I still remember it being perfect.  I like to think of myself as a spaghetti bolognese connoisseur (lol) and their's is definitely top notch. I can't remember how much it was but I remember it was very reasonable.  The red velvet slice I got this time around was HUGE.  That's why i decided to get this instead of the cupcake as they were both going for $2,99.  The cake was just okay to me.  The cream cheese frosting was great but the actual cake was nothing special.  This kind of made me think I should've got the cupcake as I feel the cake would've been more moist.  My friend thought the baklava was so so, he said it didn't taste fresh.  The cannoli was YUMmy!  Perfect balance in the filling and the shell was just right.  This place is always busy and buzzing and yes, parking can be a pain. I've gotten lucky on both my visits as I got parking on the side of the bakery.  I always look forward to coming here when I'm in the area as there's so much to try!"}
{"text":"Some of the best pastries and bread in the city. Apparently there is a moratorium on donuts until the end of March?. I miss my banana cream!  Lots of activity but it all seems to work. I noticed yesterday that they have expanded. It was always a little tight. Staff are very friendly and helpful. Best bakery in the city in my belief. And no 7.99 artisanal bread! Go!"}
{"text":"An amazing bakery! Jam packed full of delicious goods from fresh bread, hot sandwiches, pasta, deli meats, and sooooo many pastries/donuts/cakes/tarts. I came with my partner recently and were overwhelmed by all the delicious choices and had to try something from each 'section'.   We had a montreal smoked meat sandwich on focaccia bread with crispy onions with a small salad for lunch there. The bread was soft and freshly baked, and the portion was big enough for a light lunch for two people. There is an area of tables and chairs tucked beside the bakery corner, so grab a seat there to dine-in.   We then picked up a tiramisu cake for later that night and it was a hit at dinner. Everyone finished a large slice even though we after a full meal and made note of where we got it from. It was light and fluffy, not too sweet, and absolutely delicious. The ring of lady fingers around the outside was a lovely touch. It was so good that it attracted the attention of the table next to us and someone from their table demanded the same cake for their birthday when they found out it was from Sanremos.   Thankfully, in the coming days we still have the donuts, bread, lobster tails, muffins, and cannolis to enjoy! Will be coming back, probably every time I'm in the area from now on."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to brunch! First off they have the best donut selections ever!!! Rafaello coconut donuts are my all time fave! Try their cannoli and their lobster tail with fresh cream! Sooo good!   Also, try their veal sandwhich it is to die for!!!!!!! Great for a lunch and it will def fill you up!   They have a deli, bread, dessert, hot food, gelato/hot and cold drinks sections!   This place is always packed! Go early to avoid disappointment!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best bakeries I have ever been to. Amazing selection of pastries, baked goods, breads, desserts, hot foods, you name it, they probably bake it.   It was crammed full of people and the line up for the hot foods was overwhelming. But this is why I love this place. Its loved by all people. The staff are actually really friendly and paying for things is fast and quick.  The desserts are so delicious and decadent. Go for the cheesecake or the mousse desserts. YUMMMY. Only knock is the lack of parking nearby and the long line ups. I will be back for sure! 4 stars ****"}
{"text":"Just the best - the bagels and foccacia are unreal- we are here at least twice a week just love it so much"}
{"text":"I've tried a lot of items here & most are good. The almond cookies are great. The donuts are good especially the apple fritter but sells out early. If want these either come early in day or preorder it the day before. I've also tried the almond & chocolate croissants & it is also good. Coworkers have brought in bread which is good.  The only bad review I have is the cake, ordered the strawberry shortcake. I was disappointed in it, the cake itself was quite dry. I've gotten better one at Loblaws & should have went with them or Sobeys. Maybe it's been sitting there for awhile, so not fresh."}
{"text":"Great bakery with awesome selections and variety of deserts, deli and food. Wish this chain was near my home. Got the peacan cake. Yummy as hell,"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! It will definitely be my go to place on the weekend. They serve sandwiches, pizza, fresh bread, salads, lots of baked goods including donuts, tarts, pies and cakes, and gelato. There's also a small groceries section. The facilities are very clean and the service is fast and friendly. For the baked goods section at least, you had to get a number which allowed for efficient customer flow. My boyfriend and I both got sandwiches that were toasted with a panini maker - absolutely delicious with fresh ingredients. I got the Sanremo sandwich while my boyfriend got a turkey sandwich of sorts. Both were flavorful but his was packed with all sorts of turkey meat (ham, shredded turkey meat, etc.). We also got 3 donuts at $1.60 each. The most popular donuts I'm told was the red velvet and apple fritters. Red velvet was sold out so I got the Black Forest donut instead and OMG! It was filled with cherry filling with full moschino cherries. I was in heaven. My boyfriend very much enjoyed his apple fritter and we have a walnut chocolate donut saved for tonight. There is patio seating and several tables inside as well but we decided to enjoy our food at home bc the place was quite packed. Overall, a wonderful experience with very reasonable prices. We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's like a hodgepodge of all that's right in the world in one setting - a wall of donuts, massive sandwiches the size of your face, pastries galore, fresh breads, a variety of beverages, lunch options, cheese, gelato in the summertime, and grocery store items. Honestly, it's more than a \"bakery.\" Don't let the name fool you - it's like an onion. It has many, many layers, and offers way more than just your average run-of-the-mill \"bakery.\"  I've often stopped by to pick up orders of donuts for staff meetings, birthday parties, and other special occasions. I've also had one of their massive sandwiches (roast beef - and yes, it was the size of my face), their pizzas, most of their breads/pastries (croissants, yum) and, during Christmastime, I had the pleasure of consuming their Nutella holiday latte. The food is delicious and at a pretty reasonable price point. The donuts, on the other hand, are very sweet, so recently, I've been opting for their croissants instead. Nice and fresh!  Perhaps my one minor concern about this place is that service can be on and off. While some staff are normally borderline friendly, others aren't. Some of the staff members who run the donuts portion of the shop, in the mornings, have been pretty rude (An example from one morning: Me: \"Hi! I'll have half a dozen. What donuts do you have ready right now? Staff: \"EVERYTHING. You don't need to ask. (sarcastically, with a roll of her eyes, and a snicker with her colleague). Me: \"Oh... okay, can I have a couple of the Nutella, the Skor, and the Red Velvet?\" Staff: \"Uh... we don't have those ready yet.\" Me: \"But I thought you had everything?\") Yeah. That was a head scratcher. Besides that, staff are mostly pleasant.   Overall, this is a wonderful spot. If you have a chance, try out their sandwiches and their pastries, particularly their chocolate croissants. And if they still have their Nutella lattes, do yourself a favour and grab one! You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"If I could give this bakery 6 or 7 stars I would! Although san remo will be overwhelming your first visit, the hustle and bustle ends up being a part of the appeal! TIP if there is something that you want from the pastry case/donut counter just grab a number. For the breads and pies that are all around the store, just grab them and the cashier will box them for you.  My FAV thing is the lemon cannoli OMG and all the donuts and Italian pastries are to die for. Worth the trip."}
{"text":"I love San Remo and I don't really have much to add except, in my opinion, it's by far one of the best bakeries in Etobicoke.  It's super clean and very modern inside.  Aside from having simply the best red velvet cupcakes, chocolate almond croissants, donuts, etc., they also have a huge assortment of savory stuffed baguettes such as olive and red pepper, eggplant, artichoke, etc. (just to name a few).  The deli counter offers some of the freshest luncheon meats and the food from the hot counter always tastes homemade.  Pizza is awesome too!  Speaking of, they also sell pizza dough - I've seen the gluten free version there as well.  It gets pretty busy during lunchtime and parking can be a challenge.  I would suggest just parking somewhere along Royal York and walking up.  I agree with some of the reviewers that complained the staff could be a bit impolite.  Last time I was there, I said, \"hi there\" to the cashier and I was given back just a blank stare.  I repeated myself and then she seemed to warm up but still rude nonetheless.  It's a shame because most of the local Mimico, New Toronto and Long Branch businesses boast excellent customer service.  My rating would be 5/5 but, because of the hit-and-miss rudeness of the staff, I have to give it four stars."}
{"text":"Local gem! So many different types of pastries, cakes, savoury breads and yummy gelato! Best to go in the morning otherwise most things run out. Love their Sfogliatella (lobster tail).   The donuts are really good, with a variety of options such as mocha, coconut filled and chocolate coconut! Their famous one is the Nutella donut!   I Haven't tried their sandwiches or pizza's yet but would love to! Parking is available on the street and it's usually pretty busy!"}
{"text":"This place is like walking into heaven. So many options and everything you can ask for and more in a bakery. So far I've only tried the bread, a breakfast sandwich and some of their sweets but all have been excellent. Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"I LOVE doughnuts and just had the best! They beat the fancy shops that only sell doughnuts. The dough was so soft, fluffy and add the filling, so amazing, the fillings weren't too sweet and tasted as the flavour they should be. Fast service, lots of selection. Looking  forward to trying the pizza next."}
{"text":"The best bakery in Etobicoke-Lakeshore. Their coffee is very good as well.  Excellent customer service! I ordered my cappuccino there, and I got very little foam and steamed milk. When I came to cash out, the cashier asked me if she can fix the coffee. She went straight ahead to the bar and got a new cappuccino for me. Plus offer me some complimentary chocolate.   I come here once a week for desserts and whenever I'm craving for coffee.  I would definitely recommend Sanremo to everyone."}
{"text":"Our best friends ordered take-out and we had a nice night in at their place with this delicious food.  They ordered Veal Parmesan, Penne Pasta, and Garlic Bread.  I have been to Italy and the food was very similar to what we have had when we were there.  The veal was soft and not too chewy and delicious.  I could not get enough of the sauce.  I dipped the yummy garlic bread whenever I could.  The bread was crispy and mmm wow.  The pasta was rich, cheesy and creamy.  It was such a tremendous meal.  It had the meat, the pasta the bread.  Amazing.  Definitely was more than satisfied with the taste and texture and was full for hours on end!  I approve of this place for SURE!"}
{"text":"The donuts here are out of this world! My favourite flavour is their red velvet donut. They also have Portuguese egg tarts and an assortment of other baked goods. Lastly, their sandwiches are huge and delicious too! It just gets pretty busy and crowded at lunch time (even on a week day when I went). As well, it is in a pretty obscure location with mainly street parking."}
{"text":"Why I love Yelp - heeded the reviews and got here a bit early for breakfast with a friend. Snagged a non-fat Nutella latte and left it and my coat securing a table. Grabbed a mixed half dozen donuts including the flavor I knew my friend wanted just in case. This ended up being a good call. Sat in the comfy, uncongested, window seat while I watched the donut line grow.   This place smells amazing! We both went for the spinach and ricotta pizza rolls (don't know what they were called - looked like half Stromboli).  I decided that I would have liked a side of tomato sauce for dipping it in. It was good 3/5  We also split an enormous brisket sandwich to bring home and share the yumminess. Seconds later the full brisket platter was empty!   Had a decaf coffee after which was also very good. The long coffee lineup makes complete sense. 5/5  Tasted bits of several donuts, with remainder going into my freezer or being consumed by others. Sampled: apple fritter, blueberry cheese, lemon and Nutella. Blueberry cheese was my favourite, but all were delicious. 5/5  This is cafeteria style and I found the people working were friendly and helpful, but perhaps you get what you give."}
{"text":"This is my go-to bakery when I want to bring sweets as a host/hostess gift."}
{"text":"I had been following Sanremo on Instagram for a while as their sweets all looked so good in the photos that they uploaded. On a lazy Sunday, I decided to finally check it out.   It's an Italian grocery with a hot table and a dining room; however, you can also pick up a latte, pastries, or Italian buns. Obviously not a hidden gem as this place was packed when we arrived at one o'clock. There's no lot on site, but you can find a lot of free street parking in the vicinity. It's cafeteria style with a number of stations. The sandwiches (veal and meatball) we ordered were delicious and everything was extremely reasonable price wise.  I can't wait to return to try their other items!   Good for: Italian, take-out"}
{"text":"So many options! Cheap prices and a lot of variety of food from deli, hot foods, bakery, desserts, gelato and coffee. Small patio open in the summer and seating area inside. Extremely busy during the weekend but a lot of staff around to make it a quick process. Would definitely return here!"}
{"text":"First of all, I want to thank the Yelp GTA CM, Kris U., for checking in at this place recently. It popped up on my updates and prompted me to check this place out.  Lee had never been here, despite having lived in Etobicoke for a number of years. He has been riding his bicycle past this place for a number of years, and it never really blipped on his radar!  So anyway. I saw the pictures of the yummy things, and I decided that on my next trip up, we'd stop in and I'd get breakfast there. The way the place is organized, there are several counters to order things -- coffee, hot foods, donuts, and so on. There's also a central checkout place, so you can pretty much check out anywhere. There's a little seating area with tables and chairs where you can snack on your purchases.  We went in the weekend before Christmas, and the place was pretty busy, but not entirely overwhelming. We went to the donut/pastry counter and were immediately overwhelmed by the choices. I told Lee to at least get a black forest donut, because black forest cake is his favorite dessert. He also got what he thought was an eclair, but was something else entirely that was still delicious. I got a maple bacon donut, and later on a breakfast sandwich.  All of it was delicious. We saved the black forest donut for later, and we were both delighted to find that it was actually filled with cherry filling, and not just the expected cherry jam.  My maple bacon donut was wonderful, and whatever was on my breakfast sandwich (Eggs and some spicy peppers) was yummy and filling. Their coffee is really good as well.  If you want donuts, make sure to go in the mornings! This isn't like Tims, where you'll see them all day. Once they're gone, they're gone! We went in a second time that same weekend in the afternoon and noticed that, fact, as we enjoyed some brownies and coffee.  So yeah, this is really one of my favorite Etobicoke discoveries so far, and definitely a place I plan on returning to .... probably this upcoming weekend in fact!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place has it all!  1. Espresso bar 2. Hot plate - get there early because the good stuff sells out fast. 3. Bakery - the have anything and everything that you can think of...donuts, croissants, biscuits, etc...  Great spot, definitely work the check out."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious lunch fare and baked goods.  Coffee bar is nice as well.  A little confusing if you have not been here before, but once you figure it out you will be hooked!  Totally a great place to connect with people or to grab something on the run."}
{"text":"The hype is real. I love Sanremo thanks to my friends introducing me to this spot. First - parking is a mess! You can find some street parking next to the store but be warned, it's packed and you have to park a little further. Second - it's so busy inside! The line ups are busy for sandwiches, hot food and their famous donuts. But have no fear the line goes fast.   I would have to say my favourite of Sanremo is their croissants. They taste so fresh and delicious and the filling in the almond croissant is so good. I find their donuts just okay, as they taste like regular donuts to me but jacked up with other goodies on top. Overall, I definitely recommend people come here at least once to try!"}
{"text":"Great tasting Italian baked goods and more. The only downside is finding parking and dealing with the lines. Service is quick though."}
{"text":"They have the most delicious lunch sandwiches...which makes me really wanna try their breakfast. And their dessert choices are phenomenal. One of the best bakeries you will ever visit and with fair prices."}
{"text":"Happy to update and improve my rating!  I've been in for the past 2 Saturdays, early & later on in the afternoon, and this place is busy, busy, BUSY.  However, there was always parking off a residential street just North of the bakery.  Sanremo is also well-staffed and they are fairly friendly considering the volume of customers that they are serving.  They have also recently renovated with a separate section for their less busier, deli section.  Today, I finally braved the line and got one of their doughnuts.  Can I say, YUMMERS??!!  And at $1.60, how can you go wrong?  I chose the one with a Pumpkin Cheesecake filling and the doughnut itself was so incredibly light and fluffy.  Did not feel heavy or fried at all.  Very good.  Cakes themselves, depending on your taste buds, could be hit or miss, but doughnuts, breads are SOLID!"}
{"text":"Neat bakery with a huge selection of baked goods and sandwiches. If I'm not mistaken, there is also a deli section.  I was overwhelmed by the amount of people inside the bakery. It was pretty packed, and we pretty much had to squeeze through people to get from one side to another.  I was initially planning on getting a bit of everythi g but wasn't feeling it anymore after seeing all those people lining up too. I ended up getting some egg tarts and chocolate coconut macaroons. Both the egg tarts and the coconut macaroons were delicious, definitely had better."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Let's see, where to start???  They sell amazing fresh ricotta made locally. Its divine.   I love their donuts. They remind me of the donuts of my childhood - they only sell a few classic flavours (sprinkle, twist, jelly and apple fritter) but they're incredible. The apple fritters are OUT OF THIS world. They're crunchy, cinnamony and filled with fresh apple pieces. They're also inexpensive, which is a welcome change after the influx of gourmet donut shops selling donuts for 3-4 bucks each.  The rest of their baked goods are decent. Nothing is poor quality, but the donuts really are the best thing they sell.   Their cappuccino is tasty, and I love getting some prosciutto and salami from the meat counter."}
{"text":"For a person who loves donuts, I just thought I'd mentioned that I made a 3 hour round trip to get here. The store is conveniently located right in front of the bus stop. Walked inside and was amazed at how organized and tidy everything was. Upon entry you are greeted to the deli. Closely beside is where the bakery is. I rushed straight to the bakery as that was the purpose of this journey. Took a number from the wall. All I can say is that I love the number system as the place was packed with people which kept a great system. Ordered a full dozen.   Cinnamon bun and apple fritter was subpar compared to other places as it seemed to have been a bit tough. Red velvet was amazing as the dough was soft and chewy while the filling was fluffy. Most of the other yeast based donuts were great, but I didn't manage to get through all 12 as I entered a diabetic coma after 4 donuts. Overall it was great but I wouldn't be travelling 3 hours."}
{"text":"Fresh with astounding variety. Everything is good! This is a \"real bakery\", for those that understand."}
{"text":"The apple fritter itself is worth a 5.  If you haven't experienced one since Tim's and other chains switched to centralized production way back, give this a try.  The recent donut trend has dictated odd toppings but Sanremo has stuck with tradition for about half the price of the Toronto donut boutiques. That said, there are some rather unique choices such as Skor and maple walnut.    In addition, there is a wide selection of baked goods..everything from cannoli to butter tarts. The lemon meringue pies look like pillows.    This was my first time here but I can see it being a place to stop regularly coming in and out of Toronto."}
{"text":"What a cozy little place on the Evans strip. I didn't really like their numbering system for dessert. But oh was the wait worth it. I got one slice of the pecan brown which was a perfect mixture of chewy meeting chocolate. It was delightful. In the other hand, their cheese pizza was too salty. Nice  bakery overall."}
{"text":"Is the best Italian bakery in Toronto. Everything was delicious. Super fresh and homemade. The lobster tails was awesome. The pistachio ice cream amazing. I want to come back for sure.  recommend."}
{"text":"The donuts here are delicious if you don't mind the trek from downtown.  The flavours aren't as creative as some of the gourmet donut shops downtown (Glory Hole, Jelly Modern, etc.) and there isn't as much variety, but the apple fritter is delicious and the red velvet is the best donut I've ever eaten.  The nutella was good, but a bit too sweet for my liking.  Unlike the gourmet shops downtown, this place is barely more expensive than Tim Horton's ($1.15 each, tax included).  My only criticism is that the amount of filling in the donuts is inconsistent."}
{"text":"My fitness pal says California sandwich and San Franciscos veal sandwich are over 1000 calories I don't think San Remos is that high. And I hope their Apple fritters aren't   I'm going to have to run a long way for this. It's worth it. If your gonna cheat this is the place to do it."}
{"text":"I give it 5 stars for its family friendly atmosphere and delicious baked goods - almost everything I have had here from it's breads and sandwiches to its pastries, cakes and coffees have been excellent.  The bright, cheerful and busy store is a pick-me-up for everyone I bring here.  A fair amount of seating inside and outside.  Easily a top 5 bakery of Toronto!"}
{"text":"Came to this bakery on Christmas eve. Line up was well out the door, but staff made the line up orderly, by limiting the number of people in and out, had heaters and tents outside, and also handed out coffee to those waiting in line. Donuts baked fresh daily often sell out before 11am so come early. Their other pastries and desserts are also very delicious. Will try their sandwiches and other hot food items soon!"}
{"text":"Cannoli, brownies, and so much more to die for. We always stop in when we're in town. It's almost a good thing we don't live closer."}
{"text":"One of my favourite donut places!! Never disappointed and satisfies sweet tooth craving!"}
{"text":"I just popped in here but this bakery also seems like a gem. Etobicoke, where have you been all my life? (Okay, not really but you get the drift).   They have a good selection of Calabrese loaves. They also have mofo big ass sandwiches so if you like your muffaletta you'll likely get it here. Pizza? They have that too!   Otherwise, just groceries and some gelato. A good bookmark for another time."}
{"text":"Love everything about this place. The fresh food, the service, the busyness and the donuts! Just be ready to wait for a parking spot but it's all worth it."}
{"text":"Coworkers bought a few dozens of assorted donuts, and it was heaven.  I got the banana chocolate chip donut, so I can only speak for that. However I heard a lot of positive feedback on the other donuts from my coworkers.   The donut wasn't sweet but very light. Usually you can taste the sugar when consuming donuts from elsewhere, but not this one. It has a subtle banana flavour and creamy custard on the top.   I will definitely try more donuts from here!"}
{"text":"They have everything!!! Lot's of sweet options: donuts, cakes, croissants, pies, cupcakes, etc. You can also buy regular loaves of bread and pizza. Between 12pm and 2pm it gets packed!!! The hot table is very popular and the line sometimes goes out the door. What I don't like is that you do not know what is being served until you get to the front of the line and by then you are being rushed to make your order. I hate being rushed and not having the opportunity to at least skim at my options. When at the hot table, try to go with the special. The special is $8.99 with one main (several to choose from), one side (several to choose from), 1 pop/coffee/tea and one dinner roll. I believe 2 sides is $10.99. I got the veal and it was delicious!!! I also got an espresso and it brought me back to Italy. I know, that's cheesy. But it did! I took home half a dozen donuts for $4.50 and several other pastries. Yum!  ** A lot of people ordered sandwiches and pizza. I guess they are pretty good if so many regulars bought it."}
{"text":"This bakery is worth going to Etobicoke for! My jaws dropped instantly to the floor when I had my first bite of their Almond Croissant. It was perfection. They make fresh batches throughout the day because of high demand! The croissant as the right amount of sweetness. The crunchy texture from the pieces of almond compliments the soft texture of the croissant very well. The almond paste inside is just heavenly. It definitely has the \"Wow\" factor! Probably the best almond croissant I have ever had in my life so far. It is very affordable as well! I believe the almond croissant is around $3. I can't think of a better way to start your day! If you are ever in Etobicoke, you must pass by to try it. Trust me you will thank me later!"}
{"text":"A good Italian bakery, that make the best apple fritters: filled with pieces of real apple and cinnamon, a dark golden sugar glazed crust with lots of nooks and crannies for texture - sooo worth the extra hour at the gym ti work off the calories!  But get there early or order some the day before as they sell our fast.  The hot food is also great - my fave is the cabbage rolls."}
{"text":"I love this place. I have visited it 4 times in the span of 3 weeks i was there. Their hazelnut cannolis are heavenly. In all fairness,I have never had cannolis but this is the best dessert I have had in my life. They have plenty of other options, donuts, pies, pastry items but I just want their cannolis. They have a deli section which I also recommend. I have tried their roast beef and the pizza dough sandwich with spinach in it. Their coffee is also pretty good! I had one with cinnamon in it and they do a good job in not overpowering the cinnamon.   Sanremo Bakery is the heart of this street, super busy with locals who frequent this spot. I know because I lived across the street from it in an Airbnb. The day its closed, its eerily quiet on the street. I believe its one of the oldest bakery around and it really lives up to the food quality and service. Sanremo makes me want to move to Toronto and live right next to it!"}
{"text":"Seriously, mind blown! Being a typical downtowner who stays in the DT bubble 5 days a week, I would have never stopped in this place if it wasn't for you yelpers.  Expect to find the freshest baked goods, amazing selection of ready made sandwiches, and a glimpse at the perfect example of how a well-oiled bakery business operates under a high volume of customers. This place was rammed, and somehow everything was so well organized. From their ticketing system, easy to read digital menus, and excellent customer service, I was very impressed to say the least.  Product rarely sits on the shelves for too long, so everything is hot out of the oven. Get the doughnuts... seriously. The custard filled ones are amazing and stuffed to the brim with goodness. The cannoli's were my personal favourite though. With it's crispy outer shell and a light ricotta filling, and selections of chocolate chip, pistachio, etc ... it definitely rivals some of the best out there.  This place has now become a regular stop on Costco runs. Well done San Remo!"}
{"text":"A co-worker picked up a bunch of pastries from this bakery for our company event this week. They brought cannoli & donuts. Everything was really delicious & fresh. I had the chocolate banana donut which was actually pretty light tasting. It wasn't one of those deep fried donuts. It was a donut with filling which was baked. The size of the donut was large too. One donut would make a good sized snack. I couldn't eat the cannoli because I'm allergic to dairy (filling is ricotta cheese). But I brought some of the cannoli home & my family said they are really delicious. I believe there's another location for this bakery. And I'm wondering if they deliver. If they deliver I might consider ordering from them."}
{"text":"i had heard about this place because of their pumpkin cheese donut. i brought my friend here after our bike ride and we were both pleasantly surprised. big store with a lot of seatings both inside and out. not just a bakery but also a deli and a mini cafe. i got the maple bacon donut + deep fried apple cheesecake + croissant + iced frappe. the iced frappe took a while to make but the flavour was there. the donut was soft, and tasted fresh like it was made the day of. my favourite was the fried cheesecake - crunchy on the outside, soft and full of flavours on the inside. not to mention it's a pretty big portion for an affordable price. I've yet to try the croissant so i can't comment on that. my friend had the chocolate coconut and she really enjoyed it too! good place to sit down and enjoy the afternoon/read a book/catch up with a friend"}
{"text":"The best way to describe this place is WOW! I saw a review from another person on yelp when I was looking for the best bakeries and donut shops in the GTA. This place is huge- areas for sandwiches, gelato, fresh bread, specialty foods, outdoor patio and then the best area- the bakery! I do a lot of baking/gourmet desserts myself so it takes a lot for me to be impressed by baked goods. I make everything from scratch so I really appreciate places that do the same and do the desserts the justice they deserve- especially when people are paying a premium for those goods. So many bakeries claim to be \"gourmet\" and barely pass for box cake and pounds of icing sugar with a bit of butter for icing.   I tried their fresh buns and French bread- the buns were exceptional, the bread pretty good but nothing exceptional. The donuts as said by the other reviewer were amazing- SO light and fluffy (the lightest I've ever had by far). The chocolate on top was excellent and I don't even really care for chocolate. They were almost sold out so I had slim pickings at 230pm the middle of the week so get there early! Their dessert selection was immense and impressive. The custard horns were good too. The huge donut they have that they slice into pieces was by far my favourite and one of the best eclair type donuts I've ever had before.   The service was friendly and the place was packed! This is a gem worth driving out to - go hungry and be ready to make some tough decisions- way too much good stuff to choose from haha!   Highly recommended and can't wait to go back- don't know if I'll wait too much longer :) I'll post another review once I try their cake selection."}
{"text":"Divine donuts but you better get there early!  The staff are professional, efficient and incredibly friendly.  We've tried cakes like their strawberry shortcake, chocolate mousse as well as cupcakes (cookies and cream ones are so good!)and loved them all!  Their fresh bread, croissants, easter breads and pastries are also all great!"}
{"text":"Cannoli heaven! This bakery has the most amazing cannoli I've tasted outside of Italy. They have chocolate, pistachio and traditional Sicilian ricotta variations. I've also tried their apple fritters which are sensational. I would love to just go here every day, but it wouldn't be good for my waist line  Overall amazing baked goods, gelato and other sweets and treats at very reasonable prices. Best bakery in Toronto hands down!"}
{"text":"I love Sanremo's food. I've loved everything I've tried here except for the macarons. My biggest issue is the ordering system. The bakery and the coffee bar and quite straight forward, but the hot foods is a bit difficult with a line covering the options and the menus not reflecting everything available. I'm pretty much walking back and forth trying to decide what to get and the workers behind the counter aren't helpful and are really rude when you ask questions and even when you order (Note: this is only for the hot foods, the workers at the bakery and the coffee bar are really nice!). I try to come here when it's not so busy so I don't get scared of the supposed long lines.  If you're a fan of their donuts, do come early! I came in at 12pm on a Saturday and they have only 2 left. I'm not sure when they make new batches but I always seem to miss them.  ALSO - GELATO DONUT PANINIS. Enough said."}
{"text":"We got the Nutella donut, the banana chocolate chip donut and this breakfast pizza. This place, by far blew my mind. It was so good. The pizza had eggs, bacon and other cheesy toppings on top. Would definitely come back for more!"}
{"text":"There isn't anything I don't like about this place and its food. Can get great big sandwiches for lunch. Personal size pizzas also done well. The hot table is very good. Polenta...sausage, veal sandwiches, salads too! The desserts are very good. Fav is this cookie crumb shortbread like cheesecake. It's square in shape. Not sure of the name. Also croissants are very good. Nutella croissant is sinful. And of course they are famous for their donuts!"}
{"text":"Fresh donuts! However, probably not worth the drive if you're coming from far.   Get here early if you want a good selection to choose from."}
{"text":"a local fave.  Even with the expansion and reno it's still always packed.  Come here pre holiday and expect to feel like a human bumper car.  The breads are so fresh and constantly being brought out warm and smelling heavenly.  Fresh pastries are traditional and tasty and apparently their veal sandwiches are legendary.  Having never tried one I can't comment on that!  The deli side of things is great and never crowded, but beware, although customer service is top notch, they tend to move a little slower so just go in with that expectation.  Love grabbing a quick lunch and dessert treat here.  Such a warm and friendly vibe in here with lots of seating.  Patio is always buzzing in warmer months with great people watching seats.  Parking around the neighbourhood is sometimes a challenge, but do a couple of laps, you'll find something!"}
{"text":"This is a great neighbourhood bakery. They have everything you need in a one stop shop. The owners are very friendly and customer oriented. For example, today they didn't have our cupcakes ready so they provided us with two complimentary cappuccinos. Many years ago my mom came in late and they were about to close. She ordered a couple of pizzas and they gave them to her for free. It always feels like home here and their food is always delicious and fresh. Their social media presence is always awesome too! Thanks SanRemo!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful amazing bakery as you can tell from all the reviews.  Very busy on weekends so be prepared to wait but everyone is so friendly and helpful.  There is a small seating area that is always full but just a few minute wait would get you a spot as people move through quickly.  The doughnuts are the best in the city but they run out quickly.  Their pasta is simply the best - not fancy but good and hearty at a reasonable price.  Lots of parking in the area."}
{"text":"This place is dangerous.  I probably spend a significant portion of my paycheque on food here- the sandwiches (particularly the capicollo, veal and meatball sandwiches) are out of this world, the donuts are SUPER good and all the baked goods are just amazing.  I particularly love the nata tarts and the cakes and cannoli.  The treats are also not overly sugary tasting either which is quite welcome!  They also do a great job of making seasonal treats... my poor wallet."}
{"text":"Wonderful italian bakery. This place reminds me of going grocery shopping with my mom when we used to live in Italie. They have a very good selection of pastries and italian products. Blog TO rates them as the best place for cannolies, but I have to say I had better ones."}
{"text":"I live 5 minutes away and I'm  always there buying my coffee on Sundays. I've also Tried the lattes, cappuccinos and the food which all happen to be great! Also the staff are always friendly as well :)"}
{"text":"Always have a great selection of sandwiches, hot or cold, pizza, salads, meats, breads, desserts, hot and cold drinks etc.  It is busy most of the time but it's super popular and so many options to choose from which are super yummy, Personally I like the hot sandwiches and donuts!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Whenever I go to a potluck my friends always tell me \"yah..it's great that you wanna make something..but can you just bring donuts and canoli from Sanremo?\"   Also they've got quite the large selection in their deli side. You know no idea how happy I was to find a place that sells (and can properly slice) Proscuitto di Parma. Almost every other sunday I pick up some freshly baked bread and something from the deli counter and call it a lunch...  If you live in Etobicoke, you gotta check this place out."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the hype is .... really .  Italian bakery on steroids with no real VIBE and quite expensive for what one gets .... seems like their focus is volume and making $$$ versus giving their customers a wonderful dining and shopping experience ....Fortunately Toronto has lots of great options to enjoy... go try some Italian food elsewhere"}
{"text":"Sanremo is incredible! Hard to describe what it is exactly. A deli, a dessert shop, a bakery, a restaurant and a coffee bar all in one. Quality of the food here is well worth the visit. The butter tarts are some of the best I've ever had. Would highly recommend it to anyone"}
{"text":"Delicioso, Here on business from San Francisco, CA.  Wonderful canoli, Lavazza coffee, pastries - Like being back in North Beach. Tanti Grazie,"}
{"text":"Best donuts in the GTA.  That's it!  Ok their sandwiches are pretty awesome too. And their homemade gelato in the summer... yum! But the donuts... oh my god!  Yes, it's always super busy, and parking is a pain, and they run out of items, and it's difficult to grab a seat... but it's totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Most things I tried here are very delicious. Good service. Chicken salad croissant grilled, turkey on focaccia, pizzas, doughnuts, cakes, biscuits, all delicious! I go here regularly. It's always busy, especially weekend mornings."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time last week and it didn't live up to it's Instagram hype. You walk in and it's as if you've walked into a party you weren't invited to. While it's great that the staff are having a good time behind the counter; as someone who'd come in for the first time, I felt like I wasn't as interesting as the convos happening amongst the staff. At one point, another staff member said to the girl that was serving me that she should get back to her customer instead of arguing about who's get to post a picture to Instagram. We got chicken parm sandwiches and while the sandwich tasted great, we didn't get to enjoy them while they were still hot because the staff couldn't figure out the machine to print pictures to the lattes. Too many options in Toronto to be returning Sanremos."}
{"text":"They have an amazing selection of baked goods, but unfortunately there's no way my stomach can begin to make a dent in their offerings.  I had some of their bread and pastries and left the place rubbing my belly.  Overall thoughts: Their bread was fresh and delicious. Their pastries were pretty good, but nothing to rave about. If I lived in Toronto, I'd probably make many more visits and found something to call my favorite."}
{"text":"I used to be thin. Now I'm fat. And glad to be fat. Thank you Sanremo Bakery! I love love love your goodies!"}
