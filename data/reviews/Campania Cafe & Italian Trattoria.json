{"text":"Took a college group as a treat, and was so disappointed. One girl had to ask twice for her drink; another's meal was served 20 minutes before everyone else, and had to be returned. Another had her meal served 15 minutes after the rest of us. Our water glasses were hardly refilled, and we couldn't see a waiter to get help. Food was so-so. Cannot recommend coming here again."}
{"text":"The food and service here are quite good.  The dining room is small and intimate and often seems to be quite full.  There is a charming looking bar on the way in, which not surprisingly seems to be underused.  It appears to be a local favorite, and deservedly so."}
{"text":"Went with some friends and had a very enjoyable evening. Ashley, our server was excellent. She was attentive without being overly annoying. I had the chicken Marsala which came in a sweet Marsala wine sauce with mushrooms, along with excellent saut√©ed string beans. Others at the table had the linguine al mare and cavatelli pasta which they also enjoyed.  I had the tiramisu which was homemade and rivaled anything I've had in New York or Jersey. Coming down from NJ, this was better than a lot of Italian food I've had elsewhere. The owner stopped by the table to check on us during our meal. A very nice evening and I look forward to returning."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for restaurant week.  I was disappointed that the option that you see on line is the full menu, which was not the case. I didn't lower points for this though as having a full menu would be pretty trying during restaurant week.  None the less the food was pretty good. I had the veal and calamari-  my wife had the eggplant and wilted romaine.  We both had chocolate torte.  I was stuffed when it arrived but somehow found a new will to eat when it arrived, melting in mouth with each decadent bite it was excellent.    Overall I thought this was a good value.  The shortcoming: The veal was slightly overdone and the calamari was a tad greasy. The potatoes we dubbed potatoes and marzipan, as they were a sticky and lack luster.   The service was very good.  The waitress checked twice as we were having our appetizers to ensure the entree didn't arrive while we were still eating.  I had a hard time deciding between 3 and 4 stars. The overall evening and experience was excellent, but there is some attention to detail of the meal that should be addressed."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Good pasta...great caprese panini - love the friendly owners and staff!  Napoleone di melanzane alle caprese - have that!!! It's only on the dinner menu but they'll make it for lunch if you ask nicely..."}
{"text":"POSITIVES - Kindness and gentleness especially from the owners  - Food: pretty much real Italian style (and I am Italian by the way) - Warm atmosphere - Good ratio quality/price  NEGATIVES - The texture of lasagna was not quite right: real Italian oven-baked lasagna MUST be  crunchy on the top, and this one was just too soft - Wines a bit too pricey"}
{"text":"This was our first time at Campania.  Perhaps it was an off night but it certainly did not live up to most of the reviews.  Ambiance was great, food not so much.  Most of it was kind of a greasy mess.  While the tomato and mozzarella appetizer was good, the main courses were pretty bad.  The marinara sauce on the veal was too spicy, too greasy and not recognizable as marinara.  The fish entree was dry and greasy.  Many of the string beans in both dishes were discolored and sat in a greasy liquid at the bottom of the plate.  The mashed potatoes had an inexplicable pool of liquid that looked like grease on the top.  Needless to say we didn't even try them.  Glad we didn't try the calamari.  We will probably try Campania again one day, based on the other reviews and the ambiance, but it will be awhile."}
{"text":"This review is regarding a private party held at Campania.  I planned a family member's wedding reception held in the private dining room at Campania.  The setting was beautiful.  Nancy took time to meet with us and go over all of the details to make sure everything went exactly the way we envisioned it.  She worked with us on the things that didn't exactly fit Campania's pre-set packages and offered suggestions of things others had done that worked well.  On the day of, the staff and Nancy went out of their way to attend to anything and everything that needed attention.  The food was delicious, everything was served exactly on schedule, and the staff were some of the most pleasant individuals I have encountered.  I can not say enough wonderful things about our evening at Campania!  The only reason for the four star review was the set up of the sound system.  The volume and quality of the sound system were great.  However, the speakers are not wireless.  We used an Ipod for music  and had specific songs for the first dance, etc.  To use Campania's speakers, the Ipod had to be connected in a generally inaccessible room, preventing us from changing songs throughout the reception.  I attempted to use Apple's \"Airport Express\" to remotely control the music.  On a trial run at Campania, it worked perfectly. If I had not forgotten the last step to make it work on the day of (obviously my own fault - argh), I think it would've worked perfectly then too.  Still, purchasing and using the Airport Express was an extra cost and hassle.  Nancy VERY graciously worked with me to improvise when I couldn't get the music to play and we got enough of the important songs in that evening.  To sum up, if you're using an Ipod and just playing one playlist the whole time, it's no problem, but if you want to change songs during your event, make sure you speak with Nancy about this.  Overall, I still can't believe how helpful everyone was from start to finish and would highly recommend Campania as a venue for a private event.  (Based on this experience, I'm sure it would be lovely to dine at Campania any other time as well, though I can't personally speak to that.)"}
{"text":"After Il Bosco and Opentable.com found it took difficult to honor our Saturday reservation, we found ourselves at Campania and we were not disappointed.  We started with cocktails (Sangria was very good) and the panzanella salad.  The salad was very fresh, the dressing was great and the pecorino romano was a great addition.  For entrees, my wife had the rigatoni and I had the chicken parm with penne.  Both entrees were very good and the sauce was really nice with chunks of fresh vegetables.  The chicken was well cooked.  For dessert we shared the tiramisu. This was the only average part of the meal.  It was very mushy with no texture left in the lady fingers.  Our service was great and the patio table of eight, drunk ladies next to us provided great entertainment.  Also of note, this is one of the few restaurant that I have been to where the menu has no prices printed on the menu.  I am not sure if it was a special menu for Charlotte Restaurant Week or not, but thought I would mention it.  Please give Campania a try."}
{"text":"Went for very first time this Tuesday evening.  Great service and excellent food.  I enjoyed the Chicken Marsala.  It was wonderful.  Great, hot bread, olives and olive oil for dipping before entree was served.  Can't wait to go back.  Really enjoyed the overall experience and highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I made a reservation using yelp and hoped to get a message about our party to the staff prior to our arrival (since we were celebrating birthdays) but the server was unaware of my request.  The food was good but the service was really slow (and she lacked enthusiasm) in spite of our indication that we were under (reasonable) time constraints.  We will give it another try because we enjoyed our meal."}
{"text":"Food was good.  Fried calamari was excellent and a huge portion.  Chicken parmigiano was also very big portion.  My husband had linguini with shellfish - it was good but linguini was overcooked.  Live music was annoying.  My husband visited the men's room and  said if we hadn't already ordered he would have walked out.  There was no manager present. We were not overly impressed and probably will not return."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good traditional Italian meal, this is it.  I tried one of the specials, a Tuscan white bean soup, which was perfection, and a large plate of linguine with marinara and shrimp - a great carb-heavy meal after a long, tiresome day.  A glass of pinot grigio and some bread with olive oil left me stuffed but happy.  Loved the interior - I was there around 5:30 p.m. and was one of 3 patrons; it was incredibly comfortable for a solo early dinner."}
{"text":"Wife has been wanting to try this place for some time now. We took our daughter visiting from CA to try it out. Very nice ambiance and accommodations. I had the chicken marsala - was very good. Daughter tried the eggplant - it was also very good. Wife tried the NY strip...not really up to par, especially with the price tag - she was suffering from a little \"buyers remorse\" after getting the bill....No prices on the menus? - food was good, but not that good! Service was just \"ok\". Anyway, me and the daughter would return, but will have to be without the wife - don't like the odds there."}
{"text":"Went here last night for Queens Feast..... Best Calemari I have had since moving from the Northeast The Marinara sauce with Penne was awesome and the Veal Pizzaola  was tender moist and done perfectly  They have made a customer out of me  The service was excellent .... We have been looking for a good Italian restaurant near us ....we found it"}
{"text":"We had a recent work dinner at Campania after a split second decision to go here as it was close to the office. In retrospect it was a terrible decision and one we regretted almost instantly.     Our dinner unfolded like a Greek tragedy, it started okay but then descended into chaos and sadness. We started the meal after being sat in the back room by waiting...and waiting, almost 20 minutes later the waiter came back to take drink orders, keep in mind we were one of two tables at the time.  A lack of service was a theme throughout the entire meal as we  had long stretches of time without any service. They did not have three wines I tried to order, a beer, and multiple menu items, specifically shrimp which is a major part of their seafood options. I ordered the \"wild salmon\" and asked it be served with risotto.  After eating a few bites the authenticity of the wild nature of the fish came into question.  I asked the server to verify for me that it was in fact wild and, after an hour and the end of dinner, I still did not have my answer. I did not finish my meal as the salmon was overcooked, under seasoned, and terrible.  The risotto was also a let down, there was zero flavor and it had the consistency of loose gruel.   Our business partner who is in town ordered the pork chop which was burned and inedible.   His meal also went unfinished. Our meal took almost 3 hours. Other tables were seated, served, and left before we could get out of there.  At every point in this meal the miss-steps added up and increased our disappointment.  Another colleague ordered the seafood pasta (minus shrimp of course) and most of the few clams that were in it we're dead and closed. On the plus side the calamari appetizer was not bad and the first round of bread was good. The second round of bread was hard and terrible, the olive oil for dipping was insipid though the olives in the dish was a nice touch. The arancini appetizer was under seasoned, gruel like consistency, lacked the cheese and prosciutto referenced in the menu, and was generally lackluster.   Overall would I recommend this restaurant? Without reservation I can say absolutely not. I will note that our waiter was pleasant, though ineffective, which may have been due to his only working there for 2 months. While I don't like to hate on servers too much, his general pleasant attitude could not make up for the level of service we received. He did end up taking 2 meals off the bill which I thought was appropriate because they were inedible.   I wanted to like this place, its close to our office and having good options close by is always a plus, but nothing we experienced lets me ever argue for going back.  Oh, one more thing, the room was unpleasantly warm which made for an uncomfortable dining experience for everyone, exacerbated by the lack of water refills.  I hope this restaurant improves and future diners enjoy it but we will not be returning."}
{"text":"I sent an email A WEEK AGO & no response. Nothing! Here it is:  Our reservation was for 7:15 and we arrived a couple minutes after 7.  The young lady at the door greeted us with a smile and sat us promptly which was nice.  There was one couple to the left in the wine bar area, and a group of 5 or 6 at the bar area itself.  A few tables in the back had folks at them including the one next to us (that was just sat with two people).  We shared a waitress so when she brought their drinks she said hello and got our drink order.  When she brought our wine we were ready to order but she politely noted she needed to take the order for the folks behind us.  We agreed and she was turned back around to us within a few minutes.  I asked to keep a wine menu to pick one for my meal and she hesitated, saying I could have it for a few minutes, I said it's fine if she needed to take it for someone but please come back after the appetizer so I can select my other glass of wine.  My wife ordered the grilled romaine salad, Chicken Marsala and Tiramisu.  I ordered the arancini, the steak and Tiramisu.  The arancini showed quickly - while my wife's salad took a little bit longer.  We started eating when hers arrived and the arancini were fantastic.  I was doing my best to eat only one since the rice was filling and I didn't want to miss out on the entr√©e and dessert.  The waitress asked to clear plates and I let her know I was holding the one arancini to take home for a snack.  At that point our neighboring couple still hadn't received their appetizers.  I asked for the wine menu and she stepped away.  A few minutes later she walked up to the table, looked in front of me (likely checking to see if the entrees arrived) and walked away.  No wine menu to be had.  The steak and marsala arrive and still no wine menu.  She asked if she could get me another glass of Pinot and I said no.  The whole plan was to get a Cabernet or something else bold to go with the steak.  I cut into the steak and the meat was cold.  I asked for medium-rare and I understand that's a cool red center.  The outside was room temp cold as if it sat for a while before it was brought out.  I looked for the waitress and she wasn't near.  The appetizers for our neighbors now arrived via other servers.  I decided to eat the second arancini (which was still warm) rather than a cold steak.  My wife enjoyed her marsala and after 10 minutes of staring at the cold entr√©e our waitress returned.  I told her it was cold and to just box it up.  I was not interested in waiting for a refire.  My wife was nearly done eating anyway.  She asked if we wanted our dessert packed as well and I said no but bring the check with it.  It arrived and the tiramisu was fantastic.  The waitress was trying to appease the situation by taking the wine off the bill.  I am challenged to feel good about that since I paid $30 for arancini and tiramisu essentially.    We paid the bill after the desserts and as we were getting up, our neighbors got their entrees.    Restaurant week can be crazy.  You were not that busy when we arrived but it was picking up as we were almost done.  I can say with certainty that the issues of our visit were in the kitchen, but I can't understand why.  It was not a slammed Friday night.  Our waitress seemed to be seasoned and yet she wasn't handling things well.  As we entered I had commented to my wife how cute the wine bar was and we need to come back soon for that.  On my way out she said that maybe it'll be better when we come for the wine bar.  I replied we won't be back.    We probably eat out for dinner 100 times a year.  Lunches likely 200 times.  I can overlook little things as a glitch.  This was a hard visit to overlook.  A limited menu makes things easier in my opinion (and I may be wrong) so I really expected a strong showing.   I look forward to your reply."}
{"text":"What a great place to find! We came to the Campania Cafe because of the positive reviews here and, I must say, we were not disappointed at all.  We ordered the lasagna and the fettuccini with shredded spare ribs in a creamy marinara sauce and loved both. I would order the lasagna again and agian... It was just that good.  The tiramisu was delicious and quite a treat. Some of the best I've had in North Carolinia.  All in all, a very good dining experience. The service was a bit slow, but they were very attentive and made us feel special.  I'll be coming back for more."}
{"text":"Campania is one of our favorite local spots...  Warm and cozy little atmosphere...  The service is very efficient...  and the food is excellent....  I recommend the Arancini and the Cuore Romana (Grilled Romaine Heart) salad, the balsamic reduction is fabulous...  Go on, indulge!"}
{"text":"Decided to give them another shot, and the food was warm and fresh this time although the meatballs are still loaded with rosemary, to the point where there green but some folks may actually enjoy that, just not me. Glad I have them another shot"}
{"text":"We ate at Campania for the first time during restaurant week. First of all we went because on Fridays they advertise \"live music\", but they don't tell you that you can only hear it if you sit outside. Why they don't have it come thru speakers for inside patrons is a question. Also, did not care for the risotto meatballs appetizer, salads were just okay.  My maui maui disappeared on my plate---it was so small--but was average--the pasta side was okay but nothing I haven't made at home. Tirmamasu that they make on site was laden with coffee and was average and very small....chicken parmesan was overcooked (dry) and again with just average sauce..not sure what they are aiming for but they are missing the target.  Service was good, but felt a little rushed."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time after reading the great reviews.  We did take out. Order was not ready when I arrived. No big deal.  I was not that impressed with the food, neither was my husband. Food did not have much flavor. Prices are high for the quality. Spent 38.00 for two takeout spaghetti and meatballs without salads and drinks. Just seems a bit much for it being bland.   Will keep looking for a good Italian place."}
{"text":"Crown Pork. I could end this review with those 2 words. The atmosphere and staff was great. The crown pork was amazing. The sides were green beans and potatoes, unfortunately they were average. Love the local beer selections."}
{"text":"It was just OK...not bad, but honestly not too much going on to really want to go back. Pasta was over cooked; sauce was pretty good. Service wasn't bad...but I often look to the server 's opinion or enthusiasm to make decisions in new places. I didn't really get any help in that department...  We spent close to $70 with appetizer, entrees, wine, and small dessert. You could spend the same at a chain and most likely be just as satisfied."}
{"text":"Vinny from NJ has a great place.  Great food, really nice staff, reasonably priced, nice atmosphere. Gnocchi w/ butternut squash , amazing. Ravioli w/ Portabello .  Great risotto appetizer.   I could go on.  Don't overeat on bread, the portions are generous and the food is very RICH. Bread must be pre-cooked then frozen. Some pieces were cold in the middle, not warmed enough. But it was still good, not a big deal. Great cannoli's."}
{"text":"Great place wonderful service excellent food.  Looking forward to my next meal there."}
{"text":"Went there this past Monday night to celebrate my wife's birthday.  We had not been there recently but always in the past had an enjoyable somewhat romantic meal. Things have changed....bright lights strung across ceiling eliminated any ambiance from the past candlelit tables. The service was very good but the food was horrendous. We ordered calamari which arrived over cooked and tough to chew; Caesar salad was limp and warm; veal was over cooked and tough; chicken parmigiana was dry and overlooked while the sauce was bland and tasted like it came out of a can. Will never, ever, go back....ruined evening."}
{"text":"This place is incredible. Up until recently I felt like I was always on the hunt for a tasty, authentic, affordable, non-chain, and non-pretentious Italian restaurant. The hunt ended when I found Campania. The staff is polite, the wine list is excellent, the desserts are worth saving room for, and the food is off-the-charts delicious. I need more Campania in my life!"}
{"text":"Meh. Food was so so. The meatballs were good but served lukewarm. Chicken marsala was again lukewarm and was over salty. Hubby's food was not cooked correctly(he asked for salmon on the rare side and it was well done) and also very salty. Wine selections were very good.  Service was terrible. They argued with us about sitting at a round table (claimed they are only for 4 but seated the 6 of us just fine). Slow slow slow which was probably why food was lukewarm. Brought food out in weird order..... Glad we had early reservations....otherwise I'm not sure we would have made the play on time.  The place is pretty and parking is good. Not in any rush to go back.....least of all for dinner before something!"}
{"text":"My wife and I started by splitting the Cuore Romana, a fresh Romaine salad that is full of Gorgonzola, pancetta, and tomatoes that tasted like they had just come right off of the vine. My wife and I then ordered and shared the Costoletta alla Griglia, a grilled pork chop with a bourbon sauce with caramelized fennel and apples slices. The pork was great when you ate it simultaneously with the fennel and apples. We also ordered the Cavatelli e broccoletti, a dish with ricotta pasta, sweet Italian sausage, and broccoli rabe (thin little broccoli pieces). The Cavatelli dish was light and the sausage was very tasty. the only warning we have it to not fill up on bread."}
{"text":"First of all, best dang tiramisu I've ever had. Went after I had gotten off work so it was close to closing but they still graciously sat us and received great service. We shared the mussels as an app and I literally had to ask the waitress to take them away because I was eating the sauce with a fork. I had the veal and it was literally perfect. Nice and juicy and tender. The sauce was perfect with it and the prosciutto balanced it amazingly. I could also eat those potatoes every day. My boyfriend had the chicken and he says the same thing about his.  Will we be back? You can most certainly count on it. It's delicious and a fantastic date night. Can't wait to try something new soon!"}
{"text":"3 of the 4 entrees served were brought to the table and found to be barely warm. Waiter was missing for long periods of time"}
{"text":"This spot was recommended by our friends so I had high expectations. Service was gawd awful SLOW. It was on a Tuesday night. There was no excuse. We were so turned off and lost our appetite it was that slow. Reservations were at 7pm and we didn't get out of there until after 9:30pm. Ridiculous. Fish was way over cooked and the pasta did not taste fresh. I couldn't send it back because I would've had to wait another 30 minutes. I don't know if they had to actually go out and catch the fish. Honestly at the end of the night we were better off going to Olive Garden."}
{"text":"I have been here numerous times in the past for lunch.  First time here for drinks. They were short staffed and would be a 30 minute wait for table service. Hostess informed us that Tuesday night is $5.00 Martini's for any kind listed on their regular drink/cocktail menu. They have drink special practically every day.   One of the staff came by to check if everything was okay. Hostess was really efficient and sweet. They even brought up a bread plate with olive oil blended with balsamic vinegar. So tasty.  We ordered an appetizer listed on the menu as Napoleone di Melanzane alla Caprese-Thin slices of roasted eggplant, fresh mozzarella & tomato, topped with fresh basil, drizzled with balsamic. Fresh and tasty.  Nice getaway if you are in the Davidson. There is an outside patio too."}
{"text":"This was my first and most likely my last visit here. To me, first impressions are most important.   The entry is not very inviting. The entry doors are centered on the building and to access you either go left the the end and walk up the handicap ramp or go right to the end and go up aging wood steps, and then walk back down to the entry. Just not all that inviting.  Walking into a completely empty bar/wine room at 7pm on a Thursday evening was a sign that this place was not a great place to socialize. Entering the dinning room that is sparsely decorated with mismatched inexpensive poster photos of Italy. Black linen table cloths adorned a simple table with food crusted salt and pepper shakers and cheap battery operated votive candles. A leather bound menu and wine list introduces you to the offerings. The server approaches with an industry standard greeting of \"my name is *** and I'll be your server. Would you like anything to drink besides water.\" This place probably averages $30 per person which would put it into a higher class of restaurant. I would expect a more professional introduction. No offerings or suggestions of house specialties (suggestive selling) to start. Just the standard , do you know what you would like? I get this type of service when I go to Waffle House, I wouldn't expect it from a higher quality restaurant. After asking the waitress if there were any specials she replies with \"one of our specials tonight is ...\" after describing it that was it I suppose, even though the menu states that there is supposed to be a fish special (the previous special didn't have fish with it). Oh well, I ordered a chef recommended dish (pollo ripieno - stuffed chicken with spinach, Gorgonzola & red pepper accompanied with a Gorgonzola cream sauce, pan fried potatoes and a side of spinach) and a glass of chianti. The wine was served on time but the flavor profile was somewhat muted and it seemed to have been opened for a while. Fairly boring room temperature bread roll served with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. No crumbing of the table to keep it tidy. The entree took almost 15min to come out making the chicken dry and over cooked. The potatoes were a fairly poor being cooked through but not on high enough heat to sear the potatoes offering a textural crispness. The potatoes seemed as if they were kind of old with that certain dull translucency you get from old potatoes. The spinach was cooked well but was over salted. The sauce was thin and I could not taste any Gorgonzola in the dish. No check back performed by the waitress. After eating 2/3rds of my meal I decided I was finished. The server didn't enquire if I enjoyed it nor did she offer dessert listings. She just provided an industry standard \"would you like anything else\". I was pretty well done and just wanted to go so I asked for the bill. So my overall first impression of this establishment is that it is highly over priced for the dinning experience. It was not a value at all.  Unfortunately this type of service and lack of passion in both the front of the house and kitchen is being provided ALL over. I just don't understand why everyone accepts mediocrity today. Well if you enjoy mediocrity you might like this place. For me, I don't and I didn't. Everyone can have a bad day, I get that, but for the entire experience to be that way, I'm thinking  This is probably the norm here. Too bad, I would think it could be such a great restaurant."}
{"text":"Had dinner there this evening . My date and me ordered the seafood risotto. The seafood was not to be seen. It was all risotto and no seafood. There was no one to complain to since I was told the owner was the chef."}
{"text":"Took my awesome Mother to Campania for dinner this week and we were pleasantly surprised with this little secret of a restaurant. I have driven by this restaurant dozens of times and have never even noticed the place. My neighbor recently started working there and told me about the food and I was ready to give it a try. We started with the calamari, which was fresh, tender, and not greasy at all. My Mother ordered the eggplant stuffed with ricotta. It looked amazing and she raved about it throughout dinner. Very generous portion. I had the ribeye steak with garlic mashed potatoes. It was so delicious, perfectly cooked and seasoned. For dessert, we had two AMAZING slices of cake.  1) the homemade ricotta cheesecake. This was so light and perfectly textured. 2) the lemoncello mascarpone white cake. This dessert was pure heaven. It was not homemade, but made at a local bakery. I would go back just for this dessert alone.  We wrapped up dinner with some delicious Italian coffee. The staff and service was excellent. We sat outside for dinner and our server, Janice took excellent care of us. She was attentive and knowledgable about the menu. Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came from LKW for our anniversary because CIAA was in full swing....meaning we did not want to try to get a reservation in Charlotte.  Although I mentioned it was our anniversary when booking, there was no mention of it on the night.  They seated us at the \"front and center\" table, making it difficult for me to make out with my husband at dinner, but it was kind of ok because I looked so damn good that night.  Surprisingly for an Italian restaurant, there were only one or two vegetarian items on the menu, so I asked them to prepare a simple vegetarian pasta dish - which ended up consisting of spinach and a few pieces of the broccolini that you would normally throw away.  It was OK......only OK.  Unfortunately, it pains me to say that I have had better food at Olive Garden, which is depressing.  My husband's lasagna was on the cooler side of room temperature.  He said my lasagna was better, but I am a master of lasagna.  The wine and bread were great, though!    I would not go back and I certainly would not recommend this place for a \"special occasion\" meal such as an anniversary.  It's a good place for a casual meal if you are a local, I suppose."}
{"text":"Was average Italian food with smaller portions.  The live music on the porch was nice."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a date night supper here.  The decor is very warm, cozy, and romantic.  We were seated promptly in one with our reservation time.   The waiter was attentive, but he needed to go back and ask when questioned about a couple items on the menu.  The Pinot Grigio was very crisp and cold.  I believe the chef must have specialized in salads at some point in his career as they were tremendous.  In fact, they were the best part of the meal.  The pasta entrees we ordered both came with a pomodoro sauce that had a slight sweet taste to it.  Neither my wife nor I like sweet pasta sauces, so this was disappointing.  I also thought the pasta was overcooked.  All in all these were average quality entrees.  For dessert, we split a tiramisu.  Although it tasted decently, I couldn't help but think that it came out of a box.    We paid a lot for this meal, and I don't think that it was worth it overall.  However, we may still return for salads and wine."}
{"text":"We visit Campania often and most of the time we really enjoy it. This time it just wasn't that great. Our meals were salty, portion of fish was very small for the price, and sides were exactly the same for 2 totally different dishes. Even the service was off. Hopefully next time will be what we usually expect from them."}
{"text":"My husband took me here for my birthday the first time in August and we loved it! Great service and wonderful food. We have been back many times since but I have to say the lobster ravioli and lemon cake are my favorites!"}
{"text":"Visited with my son and daughter in law and were very pleased.  The food was quite good with a very impressive presentation.  I had the lobster ravoli, which was excellent, and my wife made a very nice meal from their caprese.  Service was prompt and not too attentive which gave us ample time to enjoy our meal.  The drinks are ample and the wines not too terribly pricey for my taste.  I'd highly recommend this establishment for a quiet romantic dinner, or just a pleasant time with friends.  We will be back."}
{"text":"We are sad to cross this restaurant off our list of 'locals' to go to!   The last time we were there (quite a bit ago), our order was lost. We sat there for 45 minutes waiting... waiting... waiting. At first we didn't notice the time because we were engrossed in conversation but our stomachs prompted us to look at our watches.  When we questioned the waitress, she came back apologetically. We were given a five dollar coupon toward a lunch sandwich at the register when we left-- left with a bad taste for ever going back.  Tonight we headed out to another restaurant which turned out to be closed for vacation. We decided to give Compania another try. After being seated, the waiter (sole, apparently) told us it was supposed to be a slow evening and eleven people had just wandered in. He brought our wine and said he'd be back. We never saw him again. The hostess seated some more people.... We drank wine, looked at each other with a strong sense of deja vu and decided to leave. Put money on the table for the wine and a small tip and decided to never go back!!!"}
{"text":"Uh, nothing is worse than writing a Blah review...but I need to do it..because this is our 3rd trip to Compania, and sadly the last-in fairness, 1 time was for dessert-so that was given a passing grade, the last time we went to eat there-we sat outside, I suggest that if you can(and it was satisfactory-ya know not super good but not super bad either)...but last night we decided to sit inside-a bit dark & ambiance does not make you feel \"relaxed & at home\" but just in a place \"just to get food\"...we had the bean & tomato & bread(crouton) salad to start-listed as an appetizer..kinda small and a bit different from what I remember it to be a couple years ago, but good-$9...moving on...we order everywhere pretty quickly as to not tie down a server(I used to be one at various fine dining restaurants years ago...so I know what its like to have a lingering customer who can't decide on dinner on a busy night)...so about 40 minutes later, YES 40 minutes later our dinner came out...I believe it was closer to 45 but I am giving a few minutes lee-way, it was not super packed...a few bigger tables of 8 & 9 in the far back...but this was not high time of eating either..7:45/7:50 we put in the dinner order...we got the food at 8:34...for what we paid...it was mediocre, pork chop for him, I had the airline chicken/1/2 chicken w/polenta & spinach(super small, we thought it was a small game bird on the plate, not a 1/2 chicken)...we eat Italian, we are Italian...this was a C- on Italian food, let me finish this up with the cappuccino I ordered...someone needs to teach the server we had of how to make a capp. again from the machine, especially how to actually froth milk...needless to say no taste of coffee in there but alot tasted like whole milk-stirred up...YUK, gave it to my husband and I ordered up a straight up coffee...I am sad to say we will not be back, which stinks b/c when you want Italian-you really want a good solid place that knows how to cook good Italian-nope, sorry...with Caruso's up the road...or going into Charlotte-we will opt for that-or I will just have to cook it myself :("}
{"text":"I had lunch here and it was delicious. I got the pick 2 soup / panini combo and both were very tasty. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Had dinner with 4 friends tonight. Absolutely loved everything. Great service and wonderful food. The Cuore Romana salad and Caprese salad were great. Our group loved the Cavatelli alla granchio, lasagna and pollo ripieno. I've also had involtini di melazane in the past and it was incredible. Definitely need to come here more often. Love it!"}
{"text":"Visited Friday during Restaurant Week. Two hour ordeal. Owner decided to change fryer oil during our dinner, delaying apps until meal was served. I suspect meal delay caused by need to fry several entrees. Then, despite ordering our desserts ahead, we were informed all but one option were out, but not informed until time for desserts to arrive. We were offered free round of wine or coffee, but part of our reason for choosing to try this restaurant was for the desserts listed. We asked for discounts off each meal, since three courses were to be included but weren't. We were told that our meals were already discounted for Restaurant Week. Not a good response. Finally, they offered $5 off each meal. My major issues: 1) they had advanced head count, because reservations are required, 2) we ordered desserts at start of meal, and 3) despite our request to speak to owner, he refused to come out from the kitchen. Granted, my food was good. The business plan was not."}
{"text":"First impression was not positive due to under staffing of servers (only 2). Our party of 5 waited an excessive long time to be served.  Frustration of service overshadowed the food which was good."}
{"text":"Great service and terrific food!  Many thanks to Frank our server for making a graduation dinner a night to remember."}
{"text":"This place is really good... The calamari was very fresh (they must change the frying oil often because there was no after taste). Their spaghetti n lasagna is to die for. Did I mention their sauce? Wow!!!!"}
{"text":"I just don't know. I guess if your not Italian or Sicilian and grew up on this food ya might think its good.. Eggplant parm is always an easy choice and it was just ok. Bland, meh waiter wasnt knowledgeable at all. Prices are sky high but it is Davidson.  Decor is cliche. The bar area is nice. Cocktails are watered down almost virgin..meh got me 1x. Gave it a shot."}
{"text":"This food was not good and the service was horrible. We had a corporate party and as we (women of color) were walking out, the waitress told another customer (not of color) that if they wanted to sit in the dining area they can because it's nice and quiet in there now. That was very rude and inconsiderate. I wouldn't recommend this place to eat, the prices weren't worth the food, and the service wasn't good. They took a long time to bring drinks, straws and even forgot my bread with the pasta. I asked for grilled onions and they provided raw onions and didn't offer to either bring grilled onions, it was just like oh well. The only thing good was the calamari and we were lucky to even get a sweet tea before we left and the other waitress kept reaching over our food which absolutely disgusting and inconsiderate."}
{"text":"We used to frequent Campania and enjoyed it most times (minus the previous review). Stopped by going through town recently and we couldn't believe how far they had fallen.  Food, service, etc...was just horrible. Tomatoes  were gray, food was cold and had no flavor, service took forever, etc.. Way to ruin a nice place."}
{"text":"Best food for the price I've encountered in a long time. Other reviewers who say this is a pricey restaurant must be in college. Entrees galore under $20."}
{"text":"More of the same old, same old Italian fare.  Food was good but very traditional flavors. I could have been at any Italian restaurant and it would have been the same. The food was nothing to rave about.  The service was very good. Our server, in our party of 20+, took very good care of us. Making sure our wine flowed and food served promptly."}
{"text":"Did the previous owners sell to someone else?  It used to be really good. Tonight, after they told us for the third time they were out of the wine we ordered, a new waitress came to our table and asked us to repeat what we had ordered 30 minutes ago.  Every other table received bread but we had to ask for it.  When the food finally came out, the chicken I ordered had the consistency of over cooked calamari.  I hardly ever send food back but that was the last straw.  We ended up eating my husbands pork chop which was pretty good and they took my chicken off the bill.  They have super cute, sweet young ladies working there, so I wish them luck but it might be our last trip."}
{"text":"Arancini was a pleasant surprise for appetizer.. Otherwise my entree (Mellanzane) was just okay. Next time I may try something off the specials menu (they had a Grouper dish I heard other customers praise)."}
{"text":"The best lunch at the Lake!  Wonderful food, service, decor and value."}
{"text":"In my previous review I mentioned that they didn't have a pre fixed menu for Valentines Day that year that I went. Well, this year they did and the food was great but that isn't the reason why I'm taking away a star from my previous review. I must say if there is one thing that will keep me from coming back to a restaurant, it's probably false advertisement. When I came here with my fianc√© for Valentines Day this year, we were told to sit at the bar for a few minutes while they get our table ready, which was fine. While sitting at the bar, I noticed they had a chalkboard with specials written on it, some of which included liquor specials. I asked the bartender about the specials and she told me they stopped serving liquor 6 months ago. This was very disappointing and to be honest a little frustrated seeing as it's been 6 months since they stopped serving liquor and yet they have it displayed as if they still do. We encountered a second form of false advertisement when we sat down at the table and were given an old menu. The waitress told us that this particular menu didn't exist anymore, which had me questioning why they had it present in the restaurant to begin with.... very disappointing experience I must say...."}
{"text":"Why did it take us so long to try this place?  Campania is an unassuming little restaurant that serves great Italian food in Davidson, right next door to Restaurant X.  They have a wide variety of martinis and wines by the glass.  My mango martini was huge and, at only $8, was a good deal.    After you order, they bring a basket of ciabatta rolls and balsamic/olive oil for dipping.  The bread was piping hot and good!  We started with a caesar salad for me, and the zuppa di pesce for my husband. Both appetizers were large, and the caesar salad had a few added touches, including roasted red peppers, red onions, and tomatoes.  The zuppa was filled with shrimp, calamari, and mussels, and it had a thick, tangy tomato broth.  My husband loved it.  For our entrees, I had the cavatelli with crab meat in a cognac cream sauce.  It was a perfect portion that was filled with crab and had a sauce that was delicious but not overly heavy.  It was my favorite dish of the night.  My husband had the linguini al mare, similar to your typical seafood pasta dish with a spicy marinara sauce.  He loved this as well.  I can't forget to mention the service, which was professional and attentive. Soft music was playing in the background that added to the dining room's appeal.    My husband and I left Campania knowing we'd be back.  What a nice surprise!"}
{"text":"Really good...like really really good.  The Italian Meatloaf is a different take and was spot on.  Not too spicy or peppery and the sauce was good but needed to be a little more moist.  The lasagna was as big as my head so I snagged some off my wife's plate and it was delicious.  Surprisingly also not very spicy but more rich and buttery/cheesy.    I'd definitely go back if we ever in the area again."}
{"text":"Not what it used to be. So inconsistent now. The service was TERRIBLE, and of four orders, they got one wrong, one was bland, another had dry and crusty cheese, and when we sent the fourth one back, the waitress got mad at us, even though the order was for a seven-year-old. The waitress gave us an attitude the whole time, and we were nothing but kind to her. We also had one of four water glasses filled. Strange. The food here is meh, the service is poor. And it's expensive. Conclusion: Not worth it."}
{"text":"We had dinner at Campania last night. The food is wonderful. My husband and I had the butternut squash ravioli. It was fantastic. Our son had the chicken Marsala which is also an excellent dish. A great little Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"Service was good, location was nice (not too fancy), but the food is a hit or miss. The butternut squash ravioli was delicious but a few tiny pieces for $17?? That was crazy. I'm not asking for Olive Garden portions...but a little more would have made it well worth it. The chicken marsala was soooooo dry and tasteless. It was not one but three pieces of dry chicken. The bread we had was rolls which I thought was a weird choice with olive oil. But hey, bread is free, so can't complain much there. Overall it's an ok meal but needs more consistency. Our server was so sweet though and patient so it's difficult for me to give them a lower rating...but dry chicken for those prices is crazy!"}
{"text":"Campania might not be a bakery, but it certainly has the best fresh bread in town. Between the bread basket and the homemade pasta, Campania is a carb-lover's dream come true."}
{"text":"We stopped there on the food tour and the food for what we had seemed very good. We look forward to going back and trying something else. The owners seem very nice and make you feel at home. It was an old ice house so that give you something to think about. They have a little bar for a drink before of after"}
{"text":"Delightful lunch on a beautiful day. Well prepared, peaceful restaurant, delicious food and A nice glass of vino!"}
{"text":"Update: Campania redeemed itself. Obviously my last experience was a one-off bad night. Food and service was great once again."}
{"text":"What a great experience and restaurant.  The chef and his wife not only own and run the restaurant, they are apart of the experience.  They really make sure you are enjoying your food and make great recommendations on daily specials.  The menu turns over as the chef wants to try and offer new and exciting options.  The wine list is long and extensive - with some very good options.  Definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"PERFECT DATE SPOT. So romantic, so cozy, good wine selection, great food."}
{"text":"Campania came highly recommended by an Italian friend from Chicago and it did not disappoint. Nice atmosphere in the old Davidson Ice House where half a century ago they were still making block ice and distributing fuel oil. The old hard wood floors bring the authenticity into focus. The mozzarella and tomato salad had great flavor and a nice lite dressing of some sort. My wife had a roasted fig salad which was delicious. She had an eggplant dish that was almost as good as the one at Caruso's. Excellent fresh bread and attentive service. I had the chicken cooked under a brick. Sounds crazy but it was really good. Seemed to retain its juices. My wife complained that the house wine by the glass was a little chintzy but by and large it was a nice experience."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Campania twice now: once inside and once as takeout.  Let me preface by saying that the waiters have been consistently friendly and knowledgeable about the menu and wine pairings.  They seem genuinely concerned with making the dining experience as pleasant as possible, which I very much appreciate.  In addition, their online (or over-the-phone) takeout ordering system can't possibly be any simpler or easier to use.  As for the food, however, I find it to be bland and unremarkable, as well as egregiously overpriced.  The portobello mushroom ravioli are drenched in an unappetizing, greasy, congealing cream sauce that contributes nothing to the dish except the likelihood of causing early onset obesity.  The arancini have potential, but they fall victim to under-seasoning and lack of creativity.  Overall I'm generally disappointed with Campania.  While the waiters have evidently received proper training and are enthusiastic about their work, they don't come close to compensating for the underwhelming menu.  If you absolutely must have Italian food, try Il Bosco in Davidson or even Ali√±o en Mooresville alternatively--they offer more for much less!  The tiramisu is on point, though.  Damn."}
{"text":"Part of of July's Charlotte Restaurant Week took us to Campania. We first became aware of it after going to Restaurant X for New Years, but kind of just forgot about it. After seeing it on the CRW listing and checking out their menu, we knew we had to check this place out.   Campania is a cozy little restaurant with some slight rustic charm. We were greeted and seated very quickly by friendly staff. Seating is a bit tight, but our table happened to me in a back corner, so we were more secluded than most. Our server was very knowledgeable on both the menu and wine list and brought our wines out quickly. Since we had the CRW menu we got a shared appetizer and bread then we each got our own salad, entree, dessert and glass of wine. At $30 a pop this was definitely one of the \"most bang for your buck\" restaurants we saw on the list.  For an appetizer we went with the calamari, which was done very well. It was a huge portion that was more than enough for two people (we didn't even finish it) and the tender calamari rings and baby octopus had a bit of spice to them from the pepperoncini that is tossed with it. The calamari was very lightly battered and came with marinara sauce and a spicy cream sauce for dippings. A great way to start off the meal!  Then came the bread. Instead of a loaf of sliced bread, the bread service consisted of these individual loaves. One tiny loaf (for lack of a better word) was enough for one person and it was cooked perfectly, with a crunchy outside and soft, warm inside. Also, no butter here...they are all about the oil and vinegar, which I prefer. A great bread option, and a nice surprise since I didn't think it was included with the CRW menu.  Then came the salads. I had the caesar salad which had the typical lettuce, parm, croutons and dressing but also came with cherry tomatoes and red onion. The dressing was a bit too rich, heavy and mayonnaise-y for me but was still decent. The miss' had the rucola salad which had arugula, beets, goat cheese and pistachios tossed in a vinaigrette. I'm not as big a fan of vinaigrette dressings but the miss' enjoyed it quite a bit. I did think that both salads had a somewhat small portion, compared to the heaping portions of appetizer and entree you get.  After gobbling down our greens, it was time for a carb overload with our pasta entrees! I decided to try their bolognese, since that is an Italian dish that I have loved since childhood. The bolognese consisted of rigatoni in a hearty, chunky meat sauce that contained beef, pork, carrots, onions and cream. My biggest complaint about the dish was that the pasta was overcooked into a mushy mash, which is a big no-no in my book. The meat sauce was good, though I think there was a bit too much cream as the sauce was a bit too rich.   The miss' ordered the linguine al mare which is basically spaghetti with a bunch of shellfish in it. The spaghetti was tossed in a spicy marinara with shrimp, clams, mussels and calamari. Her spaghetti was cooked much better than my rigatoni was, and the sauce was pretty tastetacular. It's always good to see an Italian place serving up a solid marinara sauce! The shellfish were all tasty with tender, firm shrimp and chewy calamari.   By this time we were totally stuffed and had our dinners boxed up. There was no way we had room for dessert so we requested to have them to go. The server was more than happy to box up our tiramisu and cannoli so we could enjoy them a few hours later when we digested a bit. The desserts were both extremely tastetacular. The cannoli retained a hard, crisp shell even after being refrigerated a couple of hours (which means they fill the cannolis to order, not hours before being served.) The cream was spot on and immediately brought us back to memories of the sweet treats we used to eat at the bakery the miss' worked at in New York. The tiramisu was also very well done. It had that overarching espresso flavor present through each bite, and the mascarpone cream was extremely delicious.   Overall, it was a pleasant dining experience at a solid Italian restaurant. After paying the bill the owner walked over and chatted a bit, and it was nice to see that her and her husband are New Jersey transplants, so they definitely know what they are doing. The majority of the food was great, though I can't let a northeast Italian get away with overcooked pasta. After having such a great experience with the CRW menu I'm looking forward to going back to give the full menu a whirl."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks! And the marinara sauce was amazing! Loved it all!"}
{"text":"I still LOVE this restaurant!!!!!   Our first visit was a year ago for restaurant week and every time I've gone since the food has always been incredible.  The atmosphere is a nice casual, there's music playing from the bar area, the staff is super nice and the FOOD!!!!!!       Ok.....second review and it's only better than the first.   Today we enjoyed the cooking class they host on certain Sunday's.    OMG!!!!!   What an AMAZING time we had.   From meeting the chef Vincent and hearing about his journey and the evolution of the space that became Campania.   That was followed with none other than Guido from Italy (yes, his name is Guido and he understands why we chuckle when he introduces himself)....he shared a Pinot Grigio his company provides for the restaurant that complimented the meal we all made.   And for those of you who are like me that react with some Vinos (although I power through that )...this wine was organic with minimal if any sulfides (no swollen hands). I highly recommend signing up for one of these cooking classes if you can get in before they're all sold out"}
{"text":"I can't believe this place has been open for five years and we never so much as looked in the window!  Fortunately, we gave it a try last night and it is now going to be our first or second favorite Italian restaurant (along with Caruso's in Mooresville).   It's located next to Restaurant X and Fuel Pizza and doesn't look like much from the front. When you walk in the front door, you'll be amazed to find a beautifully decorated entry and bar. When they take you into the dining room, you'll be shocked that this oasis exists behind the front door.  Warm & cozy but elegant enough for a romantic evening.    We brought our daughter with us for a late, Friday night dinner.  The wine list was nice but didn't include any Ripasso's, our favorite, Italian wine.  That's ok, we found something wonderful to drink.   We ordered an app and since our daughter is a vegetarian, we went with the bruschetta. It was incredible but unfortunately was topped with some prosciutto - not very veggie-friendly. This wasn't noted on the menu so beware if you're looked for a non-meat app.  Fortunately, the rolls were incredible so she was happy.   My husband ordered the special - a seafood/risotto dish and didn't leave anything behind. He loved it. I opted for the Pasta Puttanesca and had to make myself stop before I finished the entire thing. Looking forward to reheating it later today. My daughter opted for sauce and pasta and she loved it.   We shouldn't have but we ended up ordered desserts. Wow!  Worth every calorie. My favorite was the Ricotta Cheesecake. It was made in the traditional way so don't expect your typical cheesecake. The flavor was amazing and reminded me of the one my friend's mom used to make.  The chocolate torte was also great but I preferred the subtle taste of the cheesecake.   The service was exceptional. People greeted us warmly as we arrived and were equally friendly as we left. Our server knew the menu and did a great job through the meal. We'll be adding this restaurant to our list of favorites!"}
