{"text":"It seems unfair that I have to judge every pizza ive had in my entire life to yalas pizza. Years of consistently good work. Its a small shop so when things are busy you may new to wait in the storefront for a moment or two for pickup and the drive thru will almost always have a car in it but it's a perfect staple pie / hangover cure that is hard to beat. The cost and taste difference from any chain is noticeable and nigh unbeatable if youre in town or even passing through."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza joint by far, I have only ordered from the Yala's menu so far and haven't tried Elisios menu or w/e it is, the only diff from what i can see is that one is pan pizza."}
{"text":"Yalas is arguably The Best Pizza World Wide. I have tried pizza from every area pizza place and enjoyed most of them. But every pizza is compared to Yalas and every time Yalas WINS!"}
{"text":"I've eaten Yala's pizza since I was a kid. I live in Carolina now and go out of my way to have my favorite pizza of all time. Still the best anywhere."}
{"text":"Great pizza joint my Dad enjoyed in the \"good ol' days\". Pizza was great especially the crust. I can only rate the Yala's style crust which was just thick enough with crispy edge. Next time I'll try the Eliseo's deep dish crust. The sliced sausage was nice and thin with just the perfect flavor to complement the homemade sauce.  The icing on the cake to insure that I'll be back was the great customer service."}
{"text":"As a Lorain native that currently lives in Nashville Tennessee, Yala's is a must during any visit back home.  The price is great and he pizza is fantastic!  They do a great job of making sure each slice is as good as any other.  The pizza is still great cold which is nice when you are staying in a hotel without a microwave and there are leftovers.  Yala's comes highly recommend."}
{"text":"The greasiest pizza on the planet. Literally, but go and see for yourself. Really not good. Avoid for fear of heart attack."}
{"text":"I've had pizza all over this country, and they all leave me wishing I was having a Yala's pepperoni. This is the only place to get your pizza in Lorain as far as I am concerned."}
{"text":"I love this place. They recently added a drive-thru, making pizza pick-up even more convenient."}
{"text":"Yallas is on the list of food I only eat when I come home. I haven't found any that come close in Louisville,  ky. I'm still trying to find one I can add to my list for the Ville."}
{"text":"Zero stars.... terrible customer service. Napkins were out of the questions. I can't believe they would not change my order from what they had. Gave me an attitude when I picked it up. Sorry but thanks."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza in the area! Every time we are in town, we have to stop by. From the outside, it looks like any other pick up pizza place in an average location, but once you have this pizza, you will definitely be craving this."}
{"text":"First pizza I had moving here to Ohio and it was the best ... I think this going to be my favourite pizza place .... since I don't like Pizza Hut or Dominos..... it's a small pizza place .. but you know what they say don't judge a book by its cover and boy there pizza shines"}
{"text":"It's a good thing I have aged into my existence so far away from Yala's. It's also a good thing minor controlled substances skyrocketed in costs (not that I would know about stuff like that there).

Cause if even one of those things weren't true, I would own Yala's by now.

You know it is said you can never go home. Maybe not, but I know for a fact that you can go back to Yala's cause not one damn thing has changed with the best pie ever made in more than 60 years!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, our favorite local pizza spot in our new home town. We like Yala's crust and the Meatballs are outstanding."}
{"text":"Yala's pizza was the bomb on July 18. I asked for toppings to the edge & extra sauce. Wish I would've taken a pic of pizza. It was perfect. Frank, cook, did a superb job. I'll only order a pizza if Frank's making it. #satisfiedcustomer"}
{"text":"I consider myself a pizza connoisseur. I have worked with and ate every kind of pizza you can imagine. This is the best pizza I have ever ate. The sauce is robust with no overpowering herbs or sweetness,  the cheese is melted to the point of perfect stretching without falling off of your slice. Toppings are fresh and not center loaded. This is your pizza shop for authentic non-chain pizza done right."}
{"text":"Love Yalas pizza. Best pizza in Lorain by far. They have an awesome buttery crust. They are very affordable. I love ordering pizza from this place. I am so glad that it is only a few minutes away from my house that way when people come over that do not live here I can show them the \"Yalas Experience\"!"}
{"text":"My grandma and dad have eaten Yala's for years and love the pizza so I was eager to try it. Unfortunately we got a pizza with mushrooms only to find that the mushrooms Yala is using are canned mushrooms that are absolutely revolting. They were yellowish, rubbery, and sour/metallic tasting as is the standard for canned mushrooms

However, the crust was phenomenal, not soggy at all, and the sausage was delicious. The sauce was overpowered by the runoff taste of the canned mushrooms. Unfortunately, to me the canned mushrooms say a lot about the quality of ingredients this business uses, and they would be better off not offering mushrooms at all"}
{"text":"I grew up eating here and continue to get pizza every time I make it to Lorain. Yala's pizza is the best pizza EVER. Hands down the best pizza in Ohio. I love that they do thin crust pizza now too! I love their pepperoni and mushroom the best.

My tip is to ask for a side of sauce and they serve it cold yum. They have the best pizza sauce. Yala's never disappoints and I will never stop coming here. They also have a drive in now which is very convenient. Try it and you'll be hooked I promise!"}
{"text":"We live in the area and wanted to try a new pizza place (something besides the typical East of Chicago or Marco's). I searched Yelp and found this place, so we gave it a shot. Boy am I glad we did!!! So good! We got the \"deep dish\" pizza and the cheese bread it was amazing! I would highly recommend giving this place a chance. Inside looked small so more of a carry out place I would say. They even have a drive through to pick up your order."}
{"text":"I'm sorry yalas, I have to remove a star because 1)you don't have wings 2) credit card surcharge? Really? It's 2014, cash is so passe. 
I'm sick of making two stops to pick up pizza & wings. 
You're lucky your pizza is so worth it."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza! I just wish we would've got a large instead of the small. Perfectly done, fresh ingredients. Not greasy or undercooked at all. The salad was great too! All of the veggies were super fresh."}
{"text":"It was ok, cheese tasted like it was lower quality. Pepperoni was delicious, I guess I just expected a bit more. Average."}
{"text":"Love, love, love Yala's pizza!  I make sure that I order a large cheese pizza every time I'm in town. It's super cheesy.  The crust is not too thin, not too thick and the crust is perfect. Soft in the middle with a slight crunch on the outside.  They even have a drive-through! It's by far the best pizza I've ever eaten."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza & wings, was told 30 minutes. Then sat an additional 40 minutes waiting just to have to leave with no food ! Worst service!!!"}
{"text":"The Eliseo's is the best pizza in Lorain hands down. It may be the best pizza I have ever had. I just finished eating seven slices of pepperoni wirh extra sauce. Pizza nirvana."}
{"text":"Yalas is my favorite pizza. Every time I am back in Ohio, I eat my weight in pizza. Friends and family think I'm crazy when I ask them to overnight it."}
{"text":"The flavor of the dough is awful, no spice flavor at all in sauce. I would not recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"My favorite local pizza shop, great tasting pizza especially the sausage,  highly recommend.  The things  that are bad it seems like price keeps on going up for a large and they charge an extra 50 cent for you to use your debt card. I still get a pizza from Yalas adleast once a month.  You will not be disappointed"}
