{"text":"Great place, Good place to start the day. Everyone knows each other, I'm probably the only Yankee that goes there."}
{"text":"Been eating here on and off for about two years.  The burgers are great at times.  Sometimes they are overcooked and like chewing on a hockey puck.  The service is always good.  We will be going elsewhere for a while but will give them another chance, again."}
{"text":"My wife and I hosted two friends here for dinner. Even though we had often driven by, it was our first time eating here. Two of us had the salt and pepper catfish, and two had the flounder.  The fish was tasty, and the vegetables were good.  The hush puppies were delicious. Service was reasonably quick. The staff was superb and super friendly.  We will definitely dine here again."}
{"text":"We visited Wayside for the first time recently and will not be back.  The place looks and feels like it needs a good wipe down with bleach.  The food was just 'meh'...nothing worth writing home about.  I gather this a local favorite but not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"Food was terrible.  I ordered pancakes they were burnt."}
{"text":"I went there yesterday with my sister because she has been raving about this place since she moved nearby.  I got a Greek pita and it left alot to be desired.  There was just one thickly sliced tomato in it, and very little tzatziki sauce.  My sister was enjoying her meal so I didn't say anything about mine to the waitress.  Service was friendly and fast, but the food was a big thumbs down from me."}
{"text":"Great food with hearty portions.  Friendly waitresses & atmosphere.  Reasonable prices.  Have been having breakfast there twice a week for almost two years.  Loads of repeat customers.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Breakfast here is plentiful and delicious. The country ham is huge and hangs off the plate. 

Also been by to pick up dinner (last Tuesday) and there are plenty of home cooked specialties. Lots of veggie choices too. 

Only issue I have is they charge .35 cents for a teeny tiny container of ranch dressing. Boooo."}
{"text":"I was here for a business lunch and it was really good. If I am in the area I will be back here again for sure. Overall a very good place and if you want good food and good service give it a try."}
{"text":"After 6 months of working in Concord, I might be able to consider myself a regular here.  It is a solid blue plate style diner which I imagine was a hopping joint back in the day when they had rollerskating waitresses working the drive in set in the parking lot.

The food is exactly what you would expect with the exception of their daily desserts.  Their various cobblers, cakes, and pies are the perfect finish to a satisfying meal.

The staff is down home fun that is fast on service and with some witty southern charmed banter..."}
{"text":"This place is a go-to for the locals who know the home-cooking and friendly atmosphere to expect. All the staff are really friendly here, plus the service is pretty quick. 

I usually come here for breakfast, especially when I'm craving some good home-cooking.  With the breakfast menu you really can't go wrong. 

You will find very reasonable prices here. They have a daily special with country staples and a list of daily sides on the wall. Not a fancy place by any means, but a comfortable place to satisfy a craving without breaking the bank.

Great staff, good food, and cheap, what else do you need?"}
{"text":"I eat here often. Breakfast is good and the lunch specials are reasonably priced.  Chicken and dumplings are on the Wednesday special board. The dumplings are really good.  The cold plate special is a treat on Thursday.  On Friday, try a meatloaf sandwich."}
{"text":"Had the chicken Philly and fries was cooked perfect and promptly.  I would definitely recommend it. Very good sweet tea also"}
{"text":"Lazy Saturday morning, out looking for a greasy meal and stumbled on the Wayside.  We figured that the parking lot was packed, and that had to mean something, right?  It actually did.

Since it was Halloween, the entire staff was dressed in costume - there was a quarterback (Chad Pennington in Jets getup), a doctor and a nurse, a hot dog, probably a couple of others - they were all incredibly friendly.

The menu wasn't anything surprising, but it was all served with a smile, and it was served quickly (and cheaply) to boot.

We had an omelet and a burger, both were quite satisfying.  Make sure you order a Cherry-Lemon Sun Drop.  Sometimes tough to find outside of the Concord/Salisbury area, but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Great service and food! Country cooking. Friendly environment. We tried the blackberry cobbler for the first time and it was sooo good."}
{"text":"Love Wayside and love their chicken. If Rex is doing the cooking the food is always awesome. If he isn't then its a gamble. The only certainty is the desserts. The sundrop pound cake is my favorite."}
{"text":"This past weekend my husband & I, and my son's new mother & father-in-law had Wayside Catering provide food for both  rehearsal dinner and reception for our son's and their daughter's wedding. I was simply blown away at how wonderful both the food and the service were! I had never eaten at any of the Wayside restaurants, but that will change now! Rex and his crew are simply the best! Could not have asked for better anything, food or service. My hat is off to this incredible team! If there were 10 stars, that would be my rating!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast I have only eaten breakfast here but I will be back excellent food and service and the price is right great pancakes great meats just a perfect place!"}
{"text":"They do have take out and I'm not sure I'd call them soul food, but I like this restaurant! Some of my favorites include pork tenderloin pita, fried flounder and blackberry cobbler. My wife and I get take out at least once a week. It is great to have a place with a wide selection of vegetables and food that is more healthy than fast food."}
