{"text":"I had heard good things about Pin-Bar so I decided to grab dinner and play a few games last night. The staff were very friendly and attentive even when it got busy. It is a nice sized space, you don't feel crowded in at all. They have a good selection of machines (pinball and video game) as well. However, the food probably surprised me the most. I think I had low expectations because I assumed the focus would be on the gaming aspect of the bar. First off I appreciate that their lower priced items like the homemade pizza pop still had a high attention to detail using a nice flaky pastry to elevate the classic snack. The poutine was also really nice, some people might not like that the gravy and cheese are one entity but I thought it prevented the pork belly from being too much. My friend had the Champions of Breakfast and also really enjoyed it. I'm looking forward to trying some of their cocktails next time. I will be back."}
{"text":"This place is so cool! 
It in a great location being right on 17th and 4th street. There are many different pinball machines with my favourite being the wizard of oz machine. 
As well, they have a DJ sometimes such as on Saturday when I went playing totally retro music so it was super awesome! 
They also had $5 pints of steam whistle on special on Saturdays which is a great deal! 
Love it here!"}
{"text":"Super fun atmosphere and good service. Went here for drinks and played some pin ball after supper and I'm glad we did, I forgot how much fun pin ball machines are :)"}
{"text":"We had so much fun here! We went for my boyfriends birthday and it was awesome to do something a bit different. 
The food wasn't amazing but that's okay because their drinks were delicious (on the expensive side but pretty average for downtown Calgary) and the games were so fun! Each machine is uniquely interactive and one even had a surprise selfie mode haha. Overall a great environment. 
The layout is great so you can have a table to eat/chat at with your group and leave your jackets at when you go to play the games. 
Bring loonies and toonies to play! They do exchange cash for these as well. (Toonies get you the best bang for your buck).
The staff was very friendly and kept our drinks filled all night and didn't rush us to leave. 
Definitely will be going back!! Would recommend :) - the Star Wars machine was our groups favourite!"}
{"text":"Friendly service Adrian was our server on patio! She was nice service could've been just a tad quicker but it was good I was just hungry and ready to order right away! Patio had not mischievous sun at 3:30 but all others on 17th ave were packed food got cold fast! Patio is facing east not big or really fancy.
Ambiance inside was like an arcade almost! It gets busier later on in evening but around 4 it's slow! Lots of pinball machines but not real great acrcade game classics like galaga or ms Pac-Man but still fun!
Food was good I had French dip, it was tasty and my side was Kringle fries nothing fancy but good! Gravy was good dip was good and how I like it with flavour not like water! And you had option of getting it wet or soaked!!(the bun!!) My hubby had steak sandwich it was okay with tater tots I think he will get burger next time!! I liked the drinks but didn't think I would like anything with kombacha but it was refreshing!2oz too we will go back"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, delicious food and interesting cocktails. Everything you'd think a pinball bar would be. Awesome addition to the local YYC entertainment scene."}
