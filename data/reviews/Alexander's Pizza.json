{"text":"Ordered pick up, and showed up after about 45 mins. Pick up time was quoted as 10-35. The restaurant didn't bother to start our order until we got there....an hour later we recieved a crusty, dry pizza and soggy French fries. Will not be returning"}
{"text":"If you like thin greasy pizza, then Alexander's Pizza is good for you. The $6 large pizza is a nice deal, and I do admit the flavor is marginally better than Caesar's $5 pizza. The only problem was how sparse the cheese was and the cardboard box the pizza sat in was literally soaking WET from being drenched in oil.   Alexander's pizza also serves Italian and Greek entree meals. The pizza was disappointing, but their homemade (?) ranch dressing is out of this world! It's creamy, thick, and very nicely seasoned to go with their surprisingly fresh salads. Their ranch dressing really is superb and the family that runs this place seem very nice. Not the friendliest bunch of people, but you can tell their honest and work hard."}
{"text":"Had this place for first time yesterday and it was great! I live down the street from Alexander's pizza and have always wanted to try it. I ordered a vegetarian pizza with light cheese I am vegan but sometimes I like to indulge on a bit of cheese. The pizza was amazing tasted freshly made and wasn't greasy at all! Very light on the stomach. I also ordered spaghetti as well and it was good nothing spectacular tasted like spaghetti. Alexander's will now be my go to pizza place!"}
{"text":"Great food and not crazy in price! Only complaint is that these people need a theme and a bigger restaurant. These guys need places to sit for people. And the bar crowd occasionally scares people off. But this review is for the food. And it's great."}
{"text":"Best pizza around awesome place! I'm from the East Coast and always looking for good pizza. I've been to a lot of  pizza places and they never match up to what I miss from home. Until I found alexander PIZZA. I can definitely say alexander pizza is the best pizza in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Really good pizza I enjoyed every bit I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT the pizza was so fresh and hot"}
{"text":"First time ordering from here, and it was .........GREAT! The pizza's sauce was aammaazziinngg, delivery was super fast. and all the food was delic, nice and hot!! This is defin going to be our go to for ordering pizza...screw pizza hut lol"}
{"text":"Beware they will forget half of your order with delivery !!! I've ordered over 5 times from here cause I'm a sucker for sour dough pizza ....On every delivery they've forget something. First time I let it go (no side salad) , second time when they gave me the wrong wings and forget my onion rings I called back. Who ever calls themselves the \"manager\" had a horrible attitude with me and wasn't helpful with suggesting how they could make it up to me. He asked me to drive back and he could give me the Onion rings but no credit can be given out! As a loyal customer I asked him to have the items that he messed up and forget (He took my order btw) drove to me. He said that the driver was too busy. Myself being a manager of a restaurant for 5 year I was so confused as to why an owner would leave someone like this in charge of their livelihood. I will never order from here again and suggest you don't either !!!"}
{"text":"We usually order pizza as well as other items from Alexander's.  The food is excellent and is delivered quite fast.  Their delivery person, Andy, is friendly, efficient and very personable.  I would highly recommend them to anyone who's in the mood for pizza, sandwiches, appetizers  as well as pasta dishes."}
{"text":"super fast delivery pizza is outstanding but sandwhichs are so/so and their eggplant parm with pasta was very disappointing  cheap on the eggplant"}
{"text":"Very dissapointed in the 16\" white pizza I ordered. Bland, bland, bland. The 3 extra toppings at $1.50 a pop were more like a garnish and lacking. Salad was nothing special either. Come on now... you can certainly do better than that. I gave two stars because it was at least edible and the delivery guy was on time and pleasant."}
{"text":"First time customer extremely happy with the fast delivery, great service and amazing meat lovers pizza!!! Our family never eats a whole large pizza but we did today! You've got a new fan Alexander!"}
{"text":"The pizza is okay, not the best. Their wings are not good. They also took too long to deliver."}
{"text":"I see a person freaking out about a blood bone! The wings here are delish! Great food and service!"}
{"text":"Fast delivery!! Friendly delivery driver as well, ordered online and here in 30mins or less. Food was delicious"}
{"text":"We ordered pizzas from them for the first time yesterday. They were delicious! We'll be ordering again this weekend. So far, they're the best pizza shop we have found in the Whitney area."}
{"text":"went there last night for the first time, as I was picking it up, I told the guy that it was my first time and he said, \"you'll be back.\" well he is right! I got the 16\" pizza with pepperoni, meatball, and sausage. It was wonderful! I'll be back. Oh! the meatball is $2 extra, all other toppings were $1.50. I'd skip the meatball as it didn't add anything really so next time is pepperoni and sausage."}
{"text":"I order from here often. Always receive fast service and speedy delivery. Good quality pizza and friendly delivery guys."}
{"text":"Their calzones are AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS!!! Pizza is also good especially considering the price of a lg is 5.99. Definitely better than dominoes and little cesars.. Employees are very friendly too. I will definitely be a repeat customer"}
{"text":"This place has AWEFUL FOOD  Really??? $9.99 for what they call \"chicken fingers\"???? It's frozen pieces if chicken scraps and GRISTLE shaped into a chicken breast. The texture is like RUBBER and smells WEIRD!!!!! Food is NOT FRESH and they don't even have cold water to sell. Stay away !!! You've been WARNED.  OVER PRICED as well. NEGATIVE -5 stars"}
{"text":"Food is always on point and service is always pleasant! These guys are pretty awesome!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great place. Good food and always fast delivery. I'm a picky eater and my food has always come perfect and just how I asked. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The pizza is good. My son likes their cheeseburgers and their fries are ok. We've had them deliver a few times and haven't had any issues. The most recent delivery they were early so that's a plus. Their food isn't bad and they have a decent menu."}
{"text":"Love this place. So far I've tried a few pizzas, a couple of salads, and the chicken parm sub. All of them were perfect and the portions are great. Also, their chocolate cake is super good. Maybe a bit rich for some but I love it. I think the selling point for me though is that everytime I've called, the staff and delivery people have been very freindly. I'm so tired of ordering from places that act like you're inconveniencing them by giving them your money. These guys are not like that at all. I'll be ordering from  here for as long as I'm near enough to do so."}
{"text":"Great place for pizza. I love it and so does my husband. And let me tell you we are very picky with our food. Try the cleopatra pizza. The best if you like a little spicy. Delivery time is quick. They always tell you 30 minutes but I always get it 10-15 minutes tops. The staff is always friendly. The pizza is always hot and delicious. I recommend it to try. Bon appetit"}
{"text":"I order from these guys about twice a month....always friendly on the  phone and the food is usually quite good. They're close to my house so I always pick up. I recommend for those who don't like pizza chains (I don't)."}
{"text":"Decent food! So close to the house, and the specials are reasonably priced! Sandwiches are better then expected, service is nice and relatively quick"}
{"text":"I don't know what's wrong with everyone on here. I've never had a bad pizza from here. In fact I've had better than good pizza every time we've ordered from here. Their Alfredo sauce is better than most, never bland.   Their burgers are great. Juicy and flavorful, NOT greasy. Fries are blah and under seasoned but the burgers make up for it.  The grilled chicken sandwich is my favorite. Great flavor.   Delivery is always on time or early, drivers are always nice, so is everyone who answers the phone. Great service and better food than most places in vegas. If you want something generic call domino's. I'll take their delicious homemade pizza any day."}
{"text":"DE-LISH!  Their pizzas are simply amazing, as are their wings, onion rings, and chicken fingers.  They have a unique flavor that doesn't get old, and they provide PLENTY of ranch, so you never run out!  How cool is that?  Oh, and don't forget to throw in a baklava or two; they are just as amazing as the pizza!  Also, the family that works there is super nice.  Even if they seem busy, they are always open for quick conversations, good laughs, and happy smiles. :)"}
{"text":"They are amazing i always get my chicken wings from here have been getting them for about 8yrs and always amazing. Staff is super friendly! Delivery service is super fast have my food within 15-20min! Def recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We have ordered from this place for 4+ years. There WERE times when we ordered from them 2+ times a week. Unfortunately, it has been growing more and more disappointing. There is getting to be little consistently in the food. For a while, they still had pizza I loved... But, even that was different the last time ordered."}
{"text":"Food is disgusting. They sent me fries with old cheese it smelled gross, I wouldn't even feed it to my dogs. The chicken was dry and old. Worse food ever. Don't order here. The people wouldn't refund me, thank god for eat 24. They refunded me money. Yet the so called manager refused to speak with me. Horrible service , I will be calling the health department. I'm certified in food safety and they are serving unsafe food. Needs to be shut down asappppppp!!!!"}
{"text":"Always good food. Delivery is usually quick although was told one time 45 minutes after an hour I called and they said leaving now 15-20 minutes. A half hour later they finally showed up. No discount or anything, driver was apologetic, lucky the food was hot!"}
{"text":"A bit greasy on the pizza crust - when the pizza is gone there's a big oil slick in the box. Also the pieces are floppy. Nice people and ok service though."}
{"text":"It's a great neighbor place. The pizza is great. The salads are airways fresh and the chicken fingers are delicious! Always friendly and fast service."}
{"text":"Alexander's is the closest non chain pizza to my house.  We have ordered from them a few times.  We usually get pizza, wings and fingers.  The food was ok, pretty average but not bad by any means.  I loved the ranch, lots of garlic.  They have lots of different specials to save a few bucks.  The guys working are pleasant and food doesn't take to long.  They deliver, though we have always picked it up.  They are def worth a shot if you live in the area and don't want chain pizza."}
{"text":"Ordered a meat lovers pizza and garlic cheese bread. Probably the best pizza I've had since I moved to Henderson but id say it was just good not great. What wowed me was it was extremely fast delivery."}
{"text":"Our new favorite pizza spot! Affordable and the delivery was pretty quick. They also followed our specifications when we ordered and made sure everything was cooked well-done, just the way we like it!"}
{"text":"I discovered this Lil place a few months ago, I have to say the food is great ( my boys love the hot wings) but the customer service is exceptional, Andy is our guy!! He is always very friendly and helpful! This is my go to place for a fast dinner/lunch for my family!"}
{"text":"Over priced, food was so gross we couldnt even eat it ( my husband will normally eat anything so that says something). The person who took the order was rude and pushy. The only good thing i have to say is the delivery driver was nice."}
{"text":"This place definitely deserves the 5 stars . Friendly people and food is super delicious . My family always gets the Philly cheesesteaks and lemon pepper/garlic parmesan wings . Oh and the fried zucchini are the best! Recommend this place to everyone ."}
{"text":"This place is always great my husband and I love ordering from them not only are they extremely fast when it comes to delivery but they are SUPER friendly their pizza is top notch whenever I take a bite I feel like I'm in Italy! This is the place to order from if you don't feel like cooking and are too much of a bum to go outside :)"}
{"text":"We just ordered for delivery.   We ordered a small sausage pizza, chicken fingers and a 2liter and with delivery charge and taxes came out to 27!  Kinda pricey  but most places were closing so we said effff it.  Pizza was good, crust was soft and there was a good amount of sausage.  Chicken fingers were BIG and tasty.  We ordered garlic parmesan fingers and they were great!  Our food arrived around 30-40 minutes after placing it.  Overall was good just a bit pricey."}
{"text":"It's a nice little corner joint.  The pizza is pretty decent.  Good flavor, especially the pepperoni.  Better than Little Caesar's if you want a cheap pizza quick."}
{"text":"I have ordered from here a few times and each time it was great! I live close so it's super convenient and the food is always fresh. They have an anytime special that comes with a large 1 topping pizza + 1/2 bucket of wings and a 2 liter of soda for $24.95 that we always get. The wings are great, they are huge with lots of meat and we always ask for them to be drenched in the hot sauce. The pizza has a crispy crust and a tangy tomato sauce, it's not the best I have had, but it's good nonetheless.  The star of the show has to be their ranch dressing...OMG... it's a garlic ranch and is seriously one of the best dressing's I have ever had. I will forever come back this place even if it's just for a cup of this stuff lol."}
{"text":"first off i called and the guy barley spoke any english then i had ordered a pizza and had decided to cancel so 2 minutes later i called and canceled but they still charged my credit card so i called and ask for a refund and they pretty much told me too bad so beware of this and i would suggest romas pizza very good and family owned"}
{"text":"I was bored one weekend and had their little flier so I bought a large for 5.99.    I like their pizza compared to other chains such as Pizza hut and Little Caesars.  I like their sauce and they seem to be nice people.  Give them a try, it's cheap enough!"}
{"text":"This place wasn't too bad. We called ahead with our order for a pepperoni pizza and then went to pick it up. They didn't get all of it right (we asked for paper plates, napkins, cheese and peppers - which they forgot to include) but the pizza was good and affordable.  The place itself is super tiny, so I don't think it would be good for dining in unless you had a small group. They have a little table and benches. They also have interesting decor - random antique figurines on a shelf."}
{"text":"The pizza is good but I stopped coming here when an older lady was talking on her cell phone, set the phone down where they make the pizza and started making an order. My chicken wings were not done all the way and I came back, instead of getting a new order she instructed the employee to re-cook them in the oil ( they had buffalo sauce on them) and re-sauce them. That was so gross!!! Wash your hands!! Don't set your cellphone down and make food and pick up phone like nothing and do not re-cook food. It's convenient and maybe one day I will give them another shot."}
{"text":"The best wings in town! Friendly staff. Highly recommend the only thing id change is i wish there was a place to eat inside"}
{"text":"THe \" local\" pizza shop for me. I get that pizza craving most of the time but do not like to travel to my favorite places all the time. There prices are decent and they offer delivery."}
{"text":"Pizza is good, wings not the best. Staff fine. Basically a take out place. One very small table inside. Prices are good."}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty good here!  I've been stopping in here occasionally ever since it was open and the pizza here has always been consistently good.  The baklava is a must-try and there is always a recurring special with the pizza and a 2-liter soda.  A little more expensive than the Marco's Pizza I usually frequent, but since I work right down the street, stopping in for a pizza on my lunch is always a good idea.  Plus, it's always nice to stop in and snag a pizza after drinkin' at Apache Joes right across the parking lot before going home to relax."}
{"text":"BEWARE!!!  I ordered the #4 a lg pizza 20 chicken fingers and a 2 liter, when i got home after waiting 15 minutes on top of the original 20 they stated when i placed my order there were LESS THAN 10 fingers."}
{"text":"Today I was craving pizza, new to the area we were trying to find something authentic. Now nothing will be as good as my hometown Buffalo, NY pizza and wings but Alexander Pizza was awesome. We ordered online, and food was here hot within 30 or less minutes. We had the lemon pepper wings and pepperoni pizza. It was hot and delicious. We will definitely be ordering from here more often."}
{"text":"I love Alexander's. Generally get delivery, but have done take-out as well. We have tried many different items. Liked them all. The ranch is amazing and tastes great on both salads and fingers/wings or as a dipper for most anything.  I like the veggie and mozzarella sandwich as well as the eggplant (both parmesan and sandwich). Pizza is great. Better with less toppings in my opinion because the sauce is good and makes a statement of it's own."}
{"text":"If there was less then one star that's what this place would get.... It's horrible don't waste your time or money!! Ordered the white pizza its was very very salty. We each had one piece and tossed the rest. Jalapeño were okay we ate those. Then we got a slice of tiramisu it was frozen! And got the balalaika and it was stale. It was the worse meal I have ever bought!! I will say the delivery drive was very nice. 40$ not well spent!!"}
{"text":"I've order from Alexander at least 5 times a month, super friendly staff and fast delivery. food is good, nothing spectaculal. Its no secret that I keep coming back for their ranch. I eat pizza from alexander so I can dip it in their ranch.... their garlic parm fingers are probably the best I've ever had. Prices in my opinion are a bit pricey for neighborhood pizza spots, and the quality."}
{"text":"I haven't sampled the entire menu, but for a place with pizza in the name, it's a bit lackluster. Decent bang for your buck though.  Good heavy crust, not too spongy, not too tough. Way too much cheese, not nearly enough sauce and it was too bland. Good crisp veggies though.  They also have baklava which is pretty good, but not made in house which is probably why it's pretty good.   Haven't tried the rest of the menu, doubt I will."}
{"text":"Pizza is brick oven like the East coast & they are extremely generous with their Salad portions. Great Food, great prices $$"}
{"text":"In the four years I have been ordering food here, I have not been disappointed. My favorites are the pizza and meatball subs. Always hot and fresh."}
{"text":"Love the pizza and the wings haven't tried anything else yet but I sure will ever soon"}
{"text":"Love the pizza and wings from here. I live close by and they always remember me. My favorite is the lemon pepper wings. Very clean fast delivery or pickup. Nicer ingredients than a chain pizzeria. I hope they stick around for a long time here."}
{"text":"Omg i ordered a philly cheese steak and they gave me no cheese! Also their food is only DECENT if you're drunk. Best part about this place is their ranch. Either way they'll still be my drunk night delivery spot."}
{"text":"Was me and my family's first time eating here, best choice I made for dinner. I ordered two pizzas, one with pepperoni and the other with sausage. They both were delicious, their cheese was nice and stretchy. The mild sauce and BBQ wings were really good with the ranch sauce. Their fries were really bland but dipping it in ranch made up for it. The wait time was not bad and their service was helpful to us. Not bad for venturing away from the popular chains. Would totally recommend if you live in the area."}
{"text":"Had the White Pizza, they were happy to change it up the way I wanted it! Wings weren't bad. Spaghetti with Meatballs was alright. The Bakalava was really great!"}
{"text":"Ordered for the first time the other day.  Everything was great.  Guy who answered the phone also delivered.  Today I go to order and get some imbecile with an attitude about a missing building number on my address.  Yeah, not ordering from that idiot again."}
{"text":"I have been ordering food from here for years, it's always been very tasty.  It's my favorite pizza and there ranch dressing is the best."}
{"text":"I love this pizza place! They have a large variety of options, and it you like ranch you are going to love theirs!!!"}
{"text":"The food is super good. But I ordered the garlic fries they were good and the Alfredo and burger. Both of which was good. I also ordered and paid for a Philly cheese steak but when I got home the food was not in the bag. They tied the bag so I couldn't check them and now to my disappointment I will not be enjoying a philly cheese steak. My heart and soul are both wallowing in a sea of unhappiness while I watch my friends both enjoy their food and have a good time. The emptiness I feel in my heart and stomach will never be filled because this place forgot my philly cheese steak that I paid for."}
{"text":"So as many of you know three are several really fantastic pizza spots on  this side of town. This place is not even remotely close to one of them. How they were able to get a yelp to eatery is well beyond me because this food was plain awful! But ill get to that in a bit because I have to begin with some of the other reasons I will never go back to this establishment. We got here a bit earlier they open so waited till 10:30 for the place to open and when it did finally open we were greeted by a vey unhappy unclean looking gentleman who informed us of how unhappy he had been to receive a customer at the opening of business with an unwelcome glare and some scoffing comment as we walked in. Regardless we proceeded to order and it was then the smell of this place hit me and when I looked around I realized just what a  unkempt area the restaurant was! But even so we got our pizza and wings and headed out the door hoping for decent results only to be greeted by some of the most tasteless greasy wings I have ever seen and a pizza that lacked in flavor and density the likes of which I was taken aback by. Literally like putting tomato paste on cardboard and sprinkling some Wal-Mart brand motz on it then calling it good. Honestly just stay away from this place way to many options around here to waste any money on a tragedy like what's being peddled here."}
{"text":"Decided to order here because it's location is very close to the house and I didn't feel like cooking and when I tell u that was a bad choice to make. We ordered the fish and chips, shrimp dinner and side salad. The fries were so soggy, and the fish and shrimp were not cooked all the way. It was warm on the outside and cold on the inside. This was by far the worst fish I ever tasted and the batter was so mushy and disgusting we had to throw the food away so we wouldn't get sick. The only good part was the salad but they forgot our dressing and a fork."}
{"text":"Overall 4 star rating...but be careful what you order.  5 stars for pizza, delivery times, and price. 4 stars for Burgers, Wings, Baklava, and Garlic Bread, and Ranch Dressing 3 Stars for Philly sandwiches, Gyros, Spaghetti, and Lasagna  1 star for Fried Appetizers, Breadsticks, and Alfredo sauce  Mom & Pop pizza places are always hit or miss for me.  It is far too easy to overcook the toppings while leaving the dough a little underdone.  We tried Alexanders for the first time about 2 1/2 years ago, and it was GREAT.    Not a lot of places deliver where we live, so our choices are basically pizza, Chinese, or pizza.  The thing I like best about Alexanders is that in addition to their pizza, they have a very expansive menu.  Everything from Greek to Italian, Sandwiches to Burgers...all delivered to my door.  So I'd guess between my wife and I, we've tried everything on their menu at least once.    We order pizza from here so often that when the delivery guys see us at the grocery store, they come ask us how our dog is doing, or if the baby is feeling better.  We order from them at least 2 or 3 times per week, and we are rarely ever disappointed in their pizza.  it has a nice crispy crust that is good and greasy without being soggy.  I think the cheese is just right, and their sauce is pretty tasty.    For the rest of their menu, the quality depends on what you order.  Their cheeseburgers are great, but their Phillies are average.  Their lasagna is really pretty good, but their Alfredo sauce is awful.   Their BBQ wings are sweet and tasty without being too spicy, and their Ranch dressing is superb.  Their garlic bread is wonderful, but their bread sticks are pretty dry.      Other than the french fries, their entire fried appetizer menu is pretty bad.  The zucchini, stuffed mushrooms, jalapeno poppers, mozzarella sticks etc...  All bad.  They are store-bought frozen, so they'd be lackluster at best, but then adding in the delivery time and they are usually a little cold and slimy in the middle and the breading is crunchy instead of crispy.  Best to avoid those.    Every time we order from here, they say \"45 minutes to an hour\" for their delivery time, but I've yet to ever wait 30 minutes before my doorbell rings, and their record was an ASTOUNDING 16 minutes.  They had to have put the pizza in the oven while we were still on the phone."}
{"text":"There  wings and Fingers are so  good  they give  plenty of ranch dressing. Almost  every is  a must to try."}
{"text":"We just recently moved to the area from New York and we're always looking for decent pizza in the Las Vegas area. This place was GREAT. The employees were friendly and extremely helpful. We got an XL pizza, 40 wings, and a 2 liter bottle of soda for $33! The food was absolutely delicious and very reasonably priced. We will most definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"They have a pretty good pie. They are so close to our house it's pretty convenient.  But I wish they mailed out coupons to my house it would be nice to get them"}
{"text":"Pizza was great and was delivered 24 minutes after ordering on the EAT app!!! We will definitely be ordering from there again!"}
{"text":"I accidentally ordered the 24\" in pizza, biggest pizza I've EVER bought. The 2 of us ate on it for the whole week. 13 huge pieces. The place is a whole in the wall, but definitely convenient."}
{"text":"The delivery driver Andy was very respectful Alexanders pizza was a great choice.Andy the delivery driver was so respectful and very good I forgot my ranch and he actually had one for us very professional and respectful. We will definitely be ordering from you again."}
{"text":"My grandfather and I were in town visiting family who live near this shop.  We got the $6.99 carry out and that was a great deal. We got there early and were kindly greeted and told our pizzas weren't ready yet.  My grandfather loved all the little trinkets and they kept him busy while we waited.  I was surprised to see hummus and baba ghanoush on the menu and wish I would have tried the baba ghanoush. I was also pleasantly surprised that they ask if you want parmesan cheese and red pepper flakes since I've never had a shop ask me that. The pizza has a thin crust where the dough holds up to the sauce, cheese, and toppings. I found it delicious and went back for seconds and thirds."}
{"text":"Hot wings were dry and bland not sure if it even had sauce. The pizza had to much sauce and the sauce tasted like ragu. Not very tasty.  I could have got the same quality at little Cesar's for cheaper. The only pleasant part of the experience was it got to our room fast and the guy was very friendly."}
{"text":"Interesting order. The gyro platter comes with the fries sitting on top of half the pita bread. The cheese and sauce comes on the side. Probably the only gyro I have ever seen that is just meat cheese and sauce. Possibly the worst cheese fries I have ever had. Pizza cheese melted over them and by the time it was delivered it was just a congealed mess. Pulled one fry and the entire thing came with it and didn't fall apart. Pizza had good flavor but the toppings slid right off the crust repeatedly and one side had way more toppings than the other."}
{"text":"So my family and I just ordered Gyros. Worst meal we have ever had!!!!!!  We call  to inform the manager and all he did was argue with us that he has the best gyros in town. Worst food, the salad was even bad. Will never order from here again, not only because the food was bad but so was the customer service from the manager!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. They are conveniently located right around the corner from my house so I order from them quite often. Never had a complaint about the food. Wings are always delicious and thoroughly cooked. Sandwiches are yummy as well. The pizza is very good and the garlic fries are bomb.com. Definitely recommend if you live in the area and you're looking for quick and delicious food. Every time I order from them they get here within an hour, usually within half an hour."}
{"text":"This place sucks i just call to have pizza all the prices changed the van on the pic says 5.99 its not right + for dilevry the pice is 5.99 she want charge me 13.99 + tax wtf"}
{"text":"Starting with the food it was decent. I've had better. The guy behind the counter was just disgusting. Not only was he dirty, yes I know it's a restaurant and you get dirty but it was gross, but he also walked out of the building, twice, to deliver food to the bar across the parking lot and NOT ONCE did he wash his hands when he returned. You are going outside, touching germs on door handles and what not and then come back to touch food? This is gross. I will NOT be back."}
{"text":"good pizza, close to where I live. Also ordered a fettuccine Alfredo with chicken and mushrooms which was plain not much taste. However the salad. That it came with was awesome crisp fresh and great taste to it. Well overall I would order from again. Convenient as I can order through Yelp and pick-up in about 30 min."}
{"text":"I have ordered delivery from Alexander's twice. The delivery was fast within 30 minutes or less, the food was good, And the staff are friendly. Prices are average.  I have tried the BBQ wings and the pepperoni pizza, both were delicious and the ranch that comes with the wings is VERY tasty! This place gets 5 stars from me. I really do love excellent customer service and I believe that is the icing on the cake for Alexanders."}
{"text":"Their BBQ chicken pizza is the bomb! I've also had their white pizza, not bad. Love how their food isn't greasy. Great costumer service."}
{"text":"It was our first time here. When we ordered the pizzas and appetizer, I should say that the food wasn't all that I expected.   The pizzas (as pictured) I ordered were the specialty ones; the Hawaiian and Mama Mia. I would like to say that the toppings were somewhat sporadic however it may just because its a 16' ones. The crust was flat in taste but not hard and chewy; just in between. The overall taste isn't special, I guess the tomato sauce isn't zesty enough to bring the pizza to life. Overall, wasn't impressed so 1 star for it.   The appetizer (as pictured) was the bucket of chicken wings. I would like to say it was the most difficult thing to eat. The texture was extremely hard and jerky. The meat was very dry and my mom had trouble \"gnawing\" at one of the wings. It was so tough having to pull the meat off the bones. lol If I had to compare the texture, it was like the chicken wings were left under the burner for hours at a time and the meat suddenly became tough like rubber bands. Definitely not happy so no star.   There is one particular item that Alexander's Pizza was famous for and that it was its ranch dressing. I ordered 2 pairs in case just so I could try. Lo and behold!!! It was the MOST creamiest, rich, and savory ranch dressing I've ever had in forever! I couldn't compare it to commercially made ranch sauces like Hidden Valley or buttermilk brands. I just imagine it was homemade ones and what lack in the pizzas/wings makes up for in the ranch sauce. So the sauce made eating the pizzas yummy.  Impressive ranch so 2 stars for it!  I'd like to say this experience did not throw me off and will continue to explore the other options in its menu. This pizza joint has a prized ranch sauce and I will definitely come back for that with a new item soon. Very friendly and professional staff and that's what kept me attracted to this joint. So 1 star for that.   Would I come back ? A definite yes- for that ranch sauce. Overall 4 star rating."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery.... Ordered a turkey sub.  The menu didn't say what came on it, so I wrote in  Special instructions what I wanted on the sub.  Well...i open it up and 1, yes 1 slice of turkey.  Are you freaking kidding me?  And onions...i did not ask for onions.  Such a disappointment.  Not ordering from them anymore.   Though my husband ordered a small pizza and he liked it, but that's not saying much, the man will eat anything."}
{"text":"Okay, so I have been to this place twice.   Once because I was at Texas Market and my son was hungry so I walked next door to see if they sold by the slice but they didn't.  So one night we were craving Zucchini sticks and FB was too far away so we said why not and gave them a call.  We ordered a large pizza with mushrooms and sausage and an order of zucchini sticks for pick up and our total came to $17.00 Not bad I guess.  Zucchini sticks hands down, a no go. Too much breading, a little too crispy, the zucchini watery (obviously frozen product).  The pizza however, wasn't as bad as I was expecting. It was actually pretty okay. They seasoned their pizza with some kind of Italian blend and it definitely made the difference. The dough was okay until I got to the crust and then it was just a little overdone for me.  I will tell you the added plus is their pizza card. After your 10th pizza, you get one free.  This won't be a regular gotta go spot, but if I am ever craving pizza late at night - then yeah I just might."}
