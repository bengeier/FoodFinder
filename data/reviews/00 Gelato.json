{"text":"My girlfriend and I were walking off dinner calories but the summer heat still called for something cold and sweet so we stopped at this cute little hole in the wall - if you blink you'll miss it - and happiness ensued. I mean, can you ever really go wrong with gelato? Methinks not. The quality was impeccable, and guys in the place were really sweet.   Portions were perfect because, though I love gelato, nobody needs to OD on the stuff. That would be bad. I plan to try every flavor they have whenever I'm close enough to get my hands on some. You should too!!"}
{"text":"One of the best gelatos I have had in Toronto. Chocolate raspberry flavor was great; pistachio was exceptional!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best gelato place in downtown Toronto. My friend (let's just call him classic Yazdani) told me about this place and I didn't believe him first but after trying their pistachio I fell in love all over again .  P.s. Mention shahpour's special and get the 10% off.  You're welcome"}
{"text":"Interestingly enough, this place is as big as a cupboard! There's absolutely no room for customers inside, but hey, you can eat your gelato on the sidewalk and watch the King Street people stream past.  If you like creamy gelato, try pistachio. For a tangy fruit option, the raspberry hits the spot."}
{"text":"I am a gelato enthusiast, who isn't? So naturally 00 Gelato already has that going for it. I went to 00 Gelato after a Jays game for a cooldown treat. There aren't as many flavours as other gelato places but they have interesting choices. They had a few chocolatier/rich flavours such as Ferroro, Kit Kat and Cap'n Crunch. Looked like the Cap'n Crunch was not a popular choice. Ferroro is what I got based on previous reccomendations and it was amazing. The rich chocolate flavour really came through and there were bits of crunch throughout the gelato. I would get it again in a heartbeat. It wasn't overly sweet and there was so much flavour. I also had the lemon sorbet which I would say was average. I'm not sure I love sorbets as much as gelato so maybe I'm just biased. The server was also super nice; he let us try the flavours and later on brought us napkins in the seating area.   Pros: Amazing Ferroro Gelato Extremely attractive server   Cons: Limited seating- there is a bit of space next to the booth on the lower level of King Street Social"}
{"text":"Kickass gelato.   While the selection is small and the prices eyebrow-raising (although what gelato place isn't?!), the product here is top notch. Creamy, bursting of flavour, and just delicious.   If you're craving, a good go to!"}
{"text":"Wow!  I am pleasantly surprised at this gelato spot!  I passed by a few times going in/out of my hotel (Hyatt).  I thought it was weird since it looked like a random hole in the wall.  I was going to Sweet Jesus, bht the line was way too long so I ended back at the hotel and decided to check this place out and I'm sure glad I did!  The guys working here were super friendly.  They don't have many flavors, but the quality and taste of the gelato was off the hook.  Strawberry Mint - i loveddddd this!  The combination of the two was wonderful!  I highly recommend this.   Ferraro Rocher - Loved this, but wish it was more like the chocolate.  It also needed more of the wafer crunch.  It was delicious though.  Peanut Butter Brownie - Tasted really good, but I felt it could have used some more brownie.  The price for this was great and the portion size was great!   This place is a neat little gem and I recommend stopping by!  It's so much better than Kekou Gelato (and I love Asian flavored desserts)."}
{"text":"We were in the area for a different dessert destination, but the line for the other place was ridiculous, so we got gelato instead. It was a good call since the service was fast and the gelato was amazing. It really is a hole in the wall. There's enough room for the two workers and maybe two customers at a time. But it gets the job done.   I tried guava, pistachio, and cookies and cream, and all were great. They were light yet creamy, and the pistachio was particularly flavourful. The small is $5 and I'd say the amount you get is fair. They said they take everything except AmEx. I have no complaints and would go again."}
{"text":"I didn't even know this place existed, it is probably the smallest location I have ever seen for a gelato spot.   don't underestimate their location for quality! I came here twice in one week because it was so good!   I've had the kitkat flavour, hazelnut vanilla, my cousin had the mint strawberry which was really good too and the peanut butter brownie!  this place is worth checking out- their prices include tax!"}
{"text":"This place would rate higher if it wasn't for unbearably loud music they keep blasting. I assume its so people don't linger around and they can have a higher turnover. Now for the gelato it is decent and is miles better than the other spot nearby which seems to be the rave around here. The flavor selection is limited (6 if I recall) which is fine given its a tiny spot.  Decent spot to get a gelato fix in this area."}
{"text":"You know that term, size matters?  Well in this case, it doesn't!  In less square footage than the average bathroom, OO Gelato serves up some pretty good stuff!   I tried the berry cheesecake and Ferrero Rocher.  Not only were they ultra smooth tasting, but they weren't overwhelmingly sweet like ice cream can get.    This is still a fairly new establishment so there's no menu yet.  It's being worked on.    Don't be shy, these guys are totally friendly and easy to talk to.  They've got some pretty sweet beats playing to draw in the crowds."}
{"text":"This place is for sure underrated. Just around the corner from a much more \"popular\" ice-cream place, 00 Gelato offers a better quality of ice cream, at a much more simple experience at more competitive pricing. (also a lot less wait time!)"}
{"text":"00 Gelato is definitely a great spot to stop by if your in the mood for a creamy delicious treat. The place is literally the size of a closet, so only 2 people can stand in there at one time. Totally love how they made use of this small space, more places should try to do this.  As for the gelato they carry about half a dozen flavors at a time that seem to change often. Chocolate mint, kit kat, and strawberry were all awesome! I may have to stop by today to try some different flavors."}
{"text":"The living definition of 'hole in the wall'...I came here with a friend (who had picked the place having seen the positive Yelp reviews) and this same friend missed the location as we approached it. In sum, it's tricky to find even if you're looking for it! 00 is stuck in a corner right next to the Hyatt Regency hotel. As many fellow Yelpers before me have mentioned, the gelato here packs a punch despite the location's small size! I had the cookies & cream (on second thought I might have wanted to be a bit more adventurous but no matter!). You will receive a fair portion for the price you pay (which I think is relatively on par with other gelato places - $5 for a small, about $6.50 for a medium if memory serves). I was pleasantly surprised to realize that this gelato is creamy and (I tend to think) authentic - not at all like other gelatos whose taste is indiscernible from ice cream (watch out for these vendors - gelato is premium-priced, to my knowledge, because it is supposed to have less air content than ice cream per unit). The selection is not too plentiful but this place does just fine for a modest little joint tucked into the busy financial district. I'd recommend :)"}
{"text":"This is literally a hole in the wall kind of place. They have a few flavours that are uncommon and yoyr basic vanilla, chocolate, etc.  It's about $6 for a medium. I'd recommend the ferro rocher and capt crunch. The ferro rocher was less sweet than I thought and the little pieces of ferro rochers added to the texture and flavour of the gelato. Capt crunch was one of my favorite cereals as a kid, and the gelato version was only better!  There is a bench outside to sit on, but otherwise you will probably have to dig in while you walk!"}
{"text":"You have to try this hidden gem!  I must have passed over 00 Gelato several times without even noticing them but I'm so glad I stopped by!  The restaurant looks barely bigger than a closet but the gelato is delicious and the people working there are always very friendly.  What sets this place apart from all of the other ice cream/gelato places downtown?  In my opinion: Ferrero Rocher ice cream!  My favourite chocolate of all time is an ice cream!  It's as good as it sounds!  I'm told their other ice creams are also very good, like their peanut butter brownie, but I can't bring myself to try anything else.  I urge you to give this place a shot.  The line isn't usually long and goes quickly and the quality of the gelato is at least worth a taste!"}
{"text":"Perhaps one person can stand inside at the front of the counter at a time to look at the half dozen-ish flavors that 00 has to choose from.  This place is a closet in size but I swear the have the largest TV on the wall I've ever seen in a business up close.  It's close because well the place is small, I think my walk in closet is larger and I don't live in a mansion!   Still, taking into account this place is like a stand it's a nice little quick stop kind of place.  You're taking your order to go.  No, there's no place to sit.  Facing King street and part of the Hyatt formally the Holiday Inn on King (370 King to be exact).  It's closer to Widmer than Peter.  You can miss their sign pretty easily because the business is so small.  They'll let you try the flavors to see which one you want.  I just wanted something light so I went with a strawberry sorbet.  The small was straight up 5 bucks even and it was just what I wanted.  I small light taste of sweet and to be on my way."}
{"text":"Came all the way here for the gelato this holiday weekend. Subpar gelato don't know why people gave abt it."}
{"text":"Good flavors, nice price, just gotta turn down the radio out front. While waiting in line its a bit much."}
{"text":"Such a cute business. It sucks how they're closed during the Winter season because I definitely have cravings for their Gelato every month. They have very interesting flavors. Captain Crunch and Ferrero Rocher are my favorite!"}
{"text":"Yummy gelato (1 scoop sourberry cheesecake, 1 scoop lemon sorbet) and friendly staff--definitely worth a return."}
{"text":"The place is kind of hidden, so keep your eyes peeeeeled. The lemon and chocolate mint are amazing!"}
{"text":"The best hole-in-the-wall gelato place I've ever been to! Was drawn to this place after hearing their catchy tunes drifting down the street. The staff couldn't be friendlier and I would definitely recommend the salted caramel gelato or the ferrero rocher. The gelato here is creamy, the perfect amount of sweet, and incredibly satisfying :)!!"}
{"text":"Sweet boys working here and amazing gelato that sells itself! You can taste all the flavors and then decide if you need one, two, or three scoops. You have to get the two scoop option if you want two flavors, though. And a single scoop will be more than enough to satisfy your craving for gelato!  I had the peanut butter chocolate, Ferrero rocher, and strawberry sorbet on my first visit. This was probably more ice cream than I needed in three days, but it was a warm evening and I wasn't going to let this delicious commodity go to waste.   I returned the next day to have a single scoop of the ferrero rocher (with a smidge of the strawberry sorbet on top - thank you kind ice cream scooper!)   They are located right outside of the Hyatt Regency on King St. literally attached to the hotel's facade. This is a must have for a hot day in the city!"}
{"text":"OhmyGelato!  Situated right downtown this was a excellent find on a warm day as we wandered back to our airbnb. They had 4 or 5 flavors to choose from, and a little something for anyone taste: cheesecake, hazelnut, strawberry sorbet, etc.  I settled on a medium hazelnut + pistachio... and I should have just gotten a small.  Delicious and rich gelato filled me right up, but it was so good I couldn't stop!  If you're in the area be sure to stop by and pick up a scoop.  The hazelnut w/ chocolate cookie (?) bits inside was especially delish.   ps. this little spot is so small that we legit walked right past it.  The sign could only be seen from one direction which was part of the problem.  If you're headed east down King St it'll be just past Starbucks and closer to the Widmer side of the block."}
{"text":"I always walk by this place and I finally decided to try it.   My first impression is that they have very limited offerings. I usually go for pistachio but they did not carry it. I asked the server if they normally offer it and he said no because it's not a popular flavor. I was surprised because that's one of the most common flavors. Anyways, that's okay, I decided to go for ferrero rocher and strawberry.   The gelato was good and it is on par with other gelato places in the area. Nothing exceptional. It's decent. In terms of pricing, I think it's similar to other gelato places as well. Overall for quality and price, I think it's about the same as other places.   So I really don't have an incentive to purposely come here for gelato. I may get it if I pass by, but that is assuming they carry flavors I want on that day. It is so small with limited offerings, maybe the next time I pass by I will not see any flavors I like. I am not complaining since this is what they can offer given the size of the place. But it may be hard to attract all customers.  I don't think their primary focus is to attract everyone and be THE place for gelato. If people wanted gelato then they may go to a bigger store with tons of gelato flavors. 00 gelato is a small store that offers gelato conveniently while people are walking and it seems like they are doing well in that aspect."}
{"text":"A little pricey but it was pretty good! The cheesecake flavour is the best. I had the lemon sorbet as well and it was a little too sweet for my liking. The employee there was really nice and made good convo while giving samples. If I return it's because of the cheesecake flavour gelato."}
{"text":"Baby, cover me in gelato and call it a day.  Okay, but seriously. I stopped here on Sunday and this place is tucked away right on King St West and is in a great location for all the people at the Toronto International Film Festival. It's very tiny and has no seating but you don't exactly need a table to have some delicious gelato. There was a good size line when I walked up and I'm pretty sure everyone got the Oreo which meant I could not sadly, however I did get the peanut butter chocolate and it was seriously some of the tastiness gelato I've had in years! I highly reccomend this place to anyone at the film festival or venturing down King St!"}
{"text":"This place saved me from the heat! On my way down the street, 3 people asked where I got the gelato from and I`ve sent them all to you guys :) Would recommend over and over."}
{"text":"Simply delicious! I don't like a lot chocolate but the Ferrero rocher is one of a kind, 10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"Wow, really great gelato! Wish there were a few more flavors to choose from, but what we tried was very good with rich creamy texture - Ferrero Rocher and the Mediterranean (pistachio, hazelnut mix). Didn't notice the seating a little to the right on the outside below street level, that would have helped."}
{"text":"Low key spot in away from downtown. Super small... Super small place. Not a lot of options buts that no problem the gelato was great. I got the ferrero roch and cookies and cream gelato. AMAZING. They played hip hop music in a big juke box that was loud which I thought was great BUT when children came by they should've turned it off because of the explicit lyrics. Just FYI lol"}
{"text":"Went with the Cinnamon toast crunch after sampling others, kinda annoyed by the loud boom box they leave on the street. Staffer was hilariously watching Netflix the 3 times we passed by."}
{"text":"hole-in-the-wall joint like, literally.  for real. smallest place ever  often playing tunes from a powerful speaker pointed to the street  decent gelato with many standard flavours some, adventurous  there's nothing wrong here but there are better places still, give it a shot"}
{"text":"This place was so close to our hotel, it's very small but super cute! We could hear the music playing as we were walking up which provided a great atmosphere! The guy offered us samples right away and was very kind. The gelato was amazing! My boyfriend got the strawberry cheesecake, my cousin got the lemon sorbet, and I had the snickers in a waffle cone- all great choices!!!"}
{"text":"00 Gelato is like a little stick of delicious dynamite. Small location with incredible gelato. Wonderful staff!"}
{"text":"im all supporting small business. They two guys are partners and deliver fast, friendly service. Came by twice cause I like the gelato!!  Thanks gus, see you soon!"}
{"text":"Excellent gelato,  possibly the best pistachio I've ever had!   Also highly recommend the Ferrero and the salted caramel.  The lemon sorbet is also nice and refreshing but probably my least favorite flavor so far.    Definitely going to try the oreo flavor next time I go."}
{"text":"Literally a couple guys selling gelato in a doorway, or at least that what it seems.  Easy to miss if you're walking by quickly, but so stop by and try. The gelato is good and the service is friendly.  Limited selection though.  And definitely no seating.  Still, Yum."}
{"text":"I have walked by so many times assuming that the gelato or sorbet served there can't be that good. Surprisingly, it is decent. If you order a small you get only one flavour but it is a generous serving even though the cup looks small.  They're open late which is nice.  I had the chocolate salted caramel which satisfied my sweet tooth.   Although I didn't try these they also had: - berry cheesecake - chocolate coconut - strawberry min sorbet  - lemon gelato - and one more I can't remember but it was fruit flavored   Worth trying at least once.   The cheapest gelato with equally limited flavors is at City Market around the corner but they're not open as late. They have a ready to serve counter. It's about a 3.5/5 or 4/5 depending on the flavour."}
{"text":"Try their cinnamon ice cream! It's amazing! Anything I tried was good. At the corner there is a place where we could sit down as they're a small shop with no sitting area."}
{"text":"Decided to stop at this ice cream spot right after eating out. This place is tucked away in a corner. There's no seating area, honestly not much space to stand either. Good thing you don't need to sit to eat ice cream!  This is some pretty good tasting gelato, so definitely worth the trip. I had the chocolate caramel flavor, which was really good! The downside is they don't have too many flavors. I think there was 7 the day I went. I got a small and that was more than enough for me. If you're in the mood for a nice dessert, this is a place to go."}
{"text":"Delicious little hole in the wall. Literally.  The place is so small you might miss it while walking by.   Love the fact that it's no frills and closes late (midnight on Saturdays). So you can grab your gelato and go for a walk. No seating area and only fits 2 customers at a time.  They have approximately 7 flavours. Try the sea salt caramel chocolate and the mango.  You get 1 flavour for the small size , 2 flavours for the medium size and 3 flavours for large size."}
{"text":"Super cute little spot. I mean little.  Great funky music. Cute tuxedo tshirts and to die for gelato."}
{"text":"Cute little hole in the wall! Tasty lemon sorbet and nice seating next door. Perfect for a hot summer day :)"}
{"text":"Had the delicious caramel pecan gelato.  It was smooth and tasty. Quick pop in and pop out shop. If I wasn't staying at the Hyatt regency I would have missed out."}
{"text":"Oh yeah!! Here's a nice place to go to discover unusual but really good ice creams! I'm speaking of natural and homemade gelato which are changing everyday like fresh mint, guava (yum yum), blueberry & basil or fererro rocher. This hidden & tiny place is definitely worth a shot!"}
{"text":"Came by based on all the excellent reviews, and I do especially like supporting local business. However, I found that the service was quite blasé. I mean I understand that it's a small place, and there'd been someone else lining up as we were served but... not even a smile?? even after I said thank you after receiving my gelato. Maybe I came on a bad day? I got the Ferrero Rocher, and was satisfied but not blown away."}
{"text":"Very tasty gelato. Very friendly staff. They were great with my children. Recommend this to everyone. They also have dairy free options."}
{"text":"So based on the fact that what I thought was a poor gelato was in fact a sorbet, I'll revise my rating to 3 stars.  The gelatos my wife and kids are still, in our collective opinion, okay renditions, nothing that blew us away in terms of quality.  And the sorbet flavors we had were still cloying after a few scoops.  IMO, I would suggest that OO Gelato make guava-passionfruit and lemon gelatos instead of sorbets -- after all, if you're a gelateria, go whole hog on gelato flavors only and make the very best!"}
{"text":"Quite interesting place. This is legitimately a gelato place in the wall. Keep your eye on the gelato or else you'd walk right by it.   Their scoops are quite large. I had the strawberry with the cheesecake flavour and it tasted great. It's not too sweet but retains the flavour quite well. My medium bucket was loaded and I spent a good 5 minutes keeping the gelato under control.   Reasonably priced, usually a decent line outside, the beats are poppin on the boombox out front. This is a cute gelato joint and not a bad date idea."}
{"text":"Loved this tiny place. I saw them 'moving in' last week, aka they were setting up their ultra large TV. I had no idea what they were doing until this week when I heard the loud music coming from a boom box outside their door and a new sign put up.   Since they opened, (4 days ago), there has been a line out their door of people wanting to try their Gelato. Normally I do not like Gelato, but I figured I would give these people a try and give them some business.   Waited in line and enjoyed watching people walk by with curious looks on their face, trying to see what the line was for. When I got to the front, the tux-shirt clad gentleman told me the flavors they had... about 5? He let me sample the oreo, but I ended up getting the ferro rocher. AH-MAZING! Super creamy and smooth, except for the rocher bits which were nice and crunchy!   Love the fact that they made this tiny space into a business!"}
{"text":"This place is a literal hole in the wall. Gelato was very good and creamy and met expectations - definitely hit the spot with the recent hot and humid weather.   They have about 4 to 5 flavours at a time - when I went, there was: oreo, cinnamon toast crunch, hazelnut, strawberry, and nutella (names were more creative than what I've listed). They sell the gelato in small and regular sizes. I got the hazelnut in a small cup - the gelato had almond slices in it (yum!) and I found that the small was enough for me as the scoops are quite generous. I'd definitely come back if I'm in the area again."}
