{"text":"Their eggs benny is phenomenal and the chef is personable that he always comes over and talks to us.   Their ingredients are mostly local and you can truly taste it. I've been there twice in two weeks and I can't wait to go back again when they open."}
{"text":"A bit of a hodge podge the day that I went for brunch  Good quality food but cheap kind of vibe Sort of like a \"trying too hard\" greasy spoon"}
{"text":"I've never written a review of a restaurant, but I just spent $20 on one of the most dissatisfying breakfasts I've ever had. The service was friendly and some of the tastes were there, but I waited quite a while -and just for a coffee to start. I was hoping the breakfast would be worth the wait, but the portion was very small and there was nothing remarkable about the dish. I had Huevos Rancheros and I wish I had just warmed up some black beans, heated some corn tortillas, and fried a couple eggs at home. The black beans had some good flavours but were skimpy and nothing special. Only 2 eggs were served. The crispy corn tortilla was again skimpy and nothing special -I think it was just one small tortilla, quartered. The tiny bit of salsa on top was entirely unremarkable, barely noticeable. Oh, and there was a tiny bit of feta sprinkled on top with some cilantro leaves. I came in alone, no one else was there, and I'm an active, hungry adult. I simply can't understand the lengthy wait for such a small, unremarkable portion. And the bill was literally $20 including a coffee. I will never return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"One of our favourite places to eat in city. We always end up coming back - their crispy chicken sandwich is the best. Had their meat and grits, brisket and pickle sandwich, home baked cookies, and all were excellent!"}
{"text":"Came with a friend for some Saturday brunch and was absolutely blown away by the food and service. The chef-owner and wait staff are super polite and conversational, made us feel right at home as they patiently explained the specials of the day. Coffee was always topped out through the service as well.  The eggs Murgatroid were stupendous - a delightful twist on eggs benedict with roast chicken and chicken skin. The softness of the juicy roast chicken meat contrasted beautifully with the crispy chicken skin. Don't forget about the canoe potatoes on the side though. The spices and light cheese completely justify describing them as \"fully loaded\". Ask for some ketchup (which I assume must be made in house because it has the perfect balance between sweet and slightly acidic) too!  As a side note, the front door has a tendency to get stuck because it's apparently an old building. So push hard as you step through the threshold and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast with my partner and wasn't at all what we expected very disappointed.. Food was below average quality, plain and the owner slash chef slash cashier was a tad rude..."}
{"text":"I'm going with a solid four stars for Murgatroid. My wife and I have been there twice for brunch. Both times we had the english muffins which are probably the best I've ever had. They come hot off the grill. The cream cheese and preserves to accompany are just a little skimpy to achieve full coverage on two sets of muffin halves. But they taste great.   First visit I had the breadless brunch. Sorry, I was not impressed with the extremely chewy potato base for what came served on top them. I can't remember 100% if it was in the style of a benedict or not...and implying that overall my first brunch main was not too memorable...  Second visit was so redeeming. I had the Eggs Murgatroid and this was probably the best iteration of an eggs benny ever. Oh the crispy chicken skins. Memorable.   The other part I like about this place is that they have well accommodated my veggie wife. Yum yum."}
{"text":"Breakfast sandwich is overpriced and not eatable. Oil leaking all over the home made muffin which is more like a fried pancake. Never coming back."}
{"text":"Best breakfast and lunch joint on Parliament. Tastes I've never tasted before. Quickly becoming my regular."}
{"text":"Everything we ate today at Murgatroid is completely craveable. The whole menu seems to be! The brisket sandwich special with homemade spicy pickles was standout because it was moist, tender and flavourful without being covered in sauce. And although I didn't eat them, the pancakes were decadent and the homemeade cinnamon rolls and cookies were worth every loonie.  We found that the egg dishes we ordered were enjoyable but not special.  There is a great selection of local juices, and the drip coffee is free flowing.  Excited to come back one day for brunch and some board games. They have a good selection of modern strategy games like Smallworld and even some cooperative ones like Pandemic."}
{"text":"Brunch Burger and Tomato Soup were fantastic! Good coffee. Staff/Owner was super friendly and informative about ways to enjoy Toronto and sites to see!"}
{"text":"I am only staying in the city two nights but managed to find this tasty place for lunch. They also had the brunch menu but I went in late enough that I really wanted a sandwich.    Ordered: House made iced tea Murgatroid sandwich with canoe fries  Kale side salad Trio of cookies (chocolate chip, snickerdoodle, and an Aztec chocolate cookie)  Came to $25 CAD. I'll leave that up to you if you find it expensive.  Everything was fresh and super tasty. I had a lovely chat with the owner and only wish I had brought my sister so we could take advantage of their selection of boardgames."}
{"text":"Ordered take out from this place for my first visit yesterday.  First off, the staff are super friendly and very personable.  That's a big plus in my book.  A second thing that I appreciated is that you can pay via PayPal .  No need to carry a wallet, just use PayPal via your phone and it is super easy.    I ordered their bacon cheeseburger with an extra patty.  Also made it a combo with fries and a bottled soda from a small outfit in NY.  The soda was very delicious.  The burger was sublime. Great freshness and a tasty bun.    As for the fries, when I got home I honestly thought they forgot to include them.  Then I realized it was just 5 wedges with my order.  To my frugal mind that didn't seem like a great value even though they tasted good.  My take out combo (with the extra patty) came to $17.50 before tax.    Next time I'll likely just stick with the burger."}
{"text":"Great food! Highly recommend the eggs murgatroid. Perfect eggs sitting on top of the English muffin and chicken, that makes you feel guilty when cutting through with knife XD"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday morning.  The restaurant is small but not crammed with tables which is nice.   The food: we got the eggs benny special called El carnitas eggs benny, and the pigs in blankets. The eggs benny was well done. Just enough spice, eggs were perfectly poached (unlike many other places we've been to before). The pigs in blankets were great, eggs once again cooked correctly. I would have preferred the pancake to be a bit dryer and fluffier.  The pancake is sort of moist and has a similar taste and texture to a super thick Russian pancake. But the meal was delicious nonetheless.   Portion size was great for me as I am a small person and don't like to overeat. But if you are looking for a large breakfast this is not the place for that. For the portion size the meal was definitely pricy. But I would come again for the awesome quality of the food!"}
{"text":"Omg,  from the last time murgatroid has solidly anchored the north end of Parliament as the go to place for awesome food. We had 3 different breakfasts sooo good,  carnitas Benedict,  pigs in blankets and chicken Benny with crispness! Perfectly cooked,  now we are drinking some of the locally sourced (everything is) cocktails blackberry,  grapefruit and a birch beer 1 1/2 ounce. Super!  If you haven't been you need to try it out.  You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Found this place through a brunch groupon. It was 2 main dishes and 2 drinks for $19. Man it was the best $19 I spent, I would pay the regular price for the meals. We got the eggs murgatroid and it was delicious! Talked to the owner, he's super nice! Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!! Absolutely a must go to place for brunch. I had the Eggs Murgatorid and the pouch eggs are cooked perfectly and the fully loaded potatoes canoe on the side has that zing and make you crave for more. My partner had the Huevos Rancheros with that amazing pepper reddish... Man it's nice!!! Daniel and Caleb are super friendly and I finished off with their cinnamon bun... OMG!!! I'll definitely come back here again, and again, and again!!!"}
{"text":"Must have passed by this place a dozen times. Finally went in last week. Awesome food!  I had a gluten free breakfast, which was served with corn tortillas, eggs, beans and salsa.  It was excellent.  Great coffee. Excellent service.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I go to this restaurant more than once a week! The food is very fresh,very tasty and owner is very nice. I highly recommend the breakfast sandwich but everything i have eaten there is amazing"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. The staff are really friendly and knowledgeable. But the wait time for the food was slow. It took about 40 minutes from the time we ordered. They offered unlimited coffee while we waited but let's face it, how much coffee can you actually drink? The food was good but not worth the wait. Don't go if you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"I moved to toronto about four months ago from Australia, and I have to say that this is the first cafe that I've been to where the quality of food and service was absolutely phenomenal. Words can't describe it. With a mouthwatering menu and creative daily specials, I guarantee that you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Once in a while you come across an establishment that just feels great. That's how I feel about Murgatroid. The owner is a personable and friendly host who likes to make sure all of his guests are taken care of and happy with their meals. Everything I have chosen so far has been delicious and extremely tasty. Presentation is outstanding  and service is quick and friendly. I recommend this place highly."}
{"text":"Amazing food. I would never had known it existed, had it not been for groupon. I would go there any day. The food is superb, the staff is friendly and warm and the food was worth the wait. Best breakfast/brunch I have ever had."}
{"text":"Great selection of as local as possible food. They preserve they own fruit for sides,  pickle local peppers and cucs and the presentation is very good. Had the Breadless Breakfast,  friend had the Eggs Murgatroid,  both very good. Would definitely order again,  but not too soon,  lots of cool varieties of dishes. Check it out!"}
{"text":"What a joke. We went in and they were busy, but still had no problem seating us. We gave our order and waited 45 minutes. No one came over to us to check, or let us know they were running a bit behind. When I finally went up and asked, he looked pissed and rudely told me there were still a lot of people ahead of us and it would be a minimum of 20 more minutes. I'm sorry but over an hour wait for two orders? Absolutely don't waste your time at this place."}
{"text":"I randomly decided to visit Toronto with a good friend of mine. We are self-proclaimed food snobs, the worst kind. So we went on yelp and found a restaurant with between 4-5 stars. We checked out the menu and everything looked pretty good, so we hopped in an uber and made a b-line over to Cabbagetown. We get to the restaurant and I immediately knew we made a bad decision (for us, at least, the other patrons looked very satisfied). So before we ordered we headed out and luckily, Murgatroid wasn't too far. We really just happened upon it.   We walked in and the ambiance was nice, the setting? artsy. The menu looked great and we ordered drinks (local whiskey for me and a Chantilly spiked coffee for my friend).We also shared the carnitas egg benedict and an off the menu dish (I can't recall the name but it was scrambled eggs, bacon, mushrooms, onions, and other yummy fixings rolled into a pancake. It was so freaking good).   The service was also really great, the owner and chef were warm and kind, and I felt like I was with people I'd known for years. We also woke up the next morning and came back for more. I had pigs in a blanket with a side of brisket (don't ask, just know it was so yummy) and my friend had a brisket sandwich.   TLDR: If you want delicious food, a calm environment, and cool place, I think this would be a great spot."}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp for this excellent find. By tapping into the mobile app at the right place, Myrgatroid happened at the right time.   The spot is ideal for rich, delicious, colourful fare. The service was very good; served by three warm, charming, informed and culinary gifted men serving plumb pancakes, piggies in crêpes, pulled pork Bennies (a generous substitute for the signature chicken ingredient in the Myrgatroid), succulent fried pork tacos, refreshing ginger beer, bottomless fresh coffee and the promise of a liquor licence before Christmas. Definitely causes for a repeat performance. Expect a following up review soon.   Next time I'm dropping names. Kudos Myrgatroid!"}
{"text":"Amazing brunch. Maybe my new favourite place. Very attentive service. The Carnitas Benedict were incredible - - very distinct flavours, meat was succulent, and the ghost pepper relish started a party in my mouth. Thoroughly satisfied - - if I had a cigarette, I'd smoke it right now."}
{"text":"Me and a group of friends dropped in to Murgatroid a week ago and LOVED the food. I ordered the Murgatroid sandwich with canoe potatoes and an unfiltered ginger ale to drink. The sandwich was delicious: fresh bun, a sauce with just enough heat to make it spicy without burning. The potatoes amazing, and the ginger ale was fantastic, somewhere between a ginger beer and ale but nice and refreshing.  The sandwich was so good I grabbed another on the way out to try the veggie option - the Lady MacBeth which had delicious beets!  Service was friendly and quick, the seating area looked nice with plenty of local art on the wall.  We'll definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Some friends and I had brunch at Murgatroid, and everything was very good, right down to the freshly backed cookies.   The only issue is the long wait once we order until we received our food. But other than that, it was great!"}
{"text":"Not knowing this was a locavore eatery, and not being well-versed on the topic, I probably seemed slightly daft to those who were running this lovely joint, and seemed to be the owners. Menu had enough items to be interesting, but not too long to be overwhelming. I had the special, a seared brisket sandwich with old white cheddar and pickles, and what seemed like grainy mustard. Brisket flavour was good but was marbled with fat; I ended up opening the sandwich and cutting off the fat.  For some reason I thought brisket was a large piece of roasted meat that was then shaved into thin slices. This was more of a patty of brisket. Nonetheless, good flavour, fresh sides, and very salty hot canoe potatoes with a shaving of parm cheese. My friend had the eggs benedict with chicken and canoe potatoes- she enjoyed it. In a city obsessed with brunch, I was surprised to find the restaurant with only a few tables on a Sunday, though it was the long weekend. I would return for sure, if anything to see the rotation of specials not normally on the menu. Special teas available by the pot are also a hit."}
{"text":"My husband and I came in on a Monday morning. They were busy with take out orders but treated us well to an in house brunch. Food was delicious, right down to the potato canoes! We took some cookies for the road and needless to say they didn't last long. We highly recommend them and can tell a lot of care goes into their business."}
{"text":"First of all I want to give a big thanks to Zomato for offering a complimentary coupon at Murgatroid. It was unfortunate that I had to do take-out because the dine-in experience would have been very different.  I don't work in Cabbagetown so getting there was a journey in itself. I'm glad that Murgatroid offers an online ordering system and it does a good job of predicting when the food would be ready by. The only downfall is that dine-in options offer more of a variety whereas the take-out menu is limited. Someone called me after my order to alert me that taxes will have to be paid out in cash and luckily I had some change on me even though I was already on my way. Upon arrival, I was greeted by the staff and he clarified the orders with me because they didn't get a confirmation email on their end. Just a minor issue. The restaurant offers a homey feeling and is stocked with some board games on the side (hopefully guests can play those too). I'll talk about the food later but I hope they can do delivery in the future!  I find it interesting that Murgatroid's specialty is in making everything from scratch; it is not that common in Toronto. You can take a look at their website and read how they primarily use local produce and other things. Unless I'm clueless, I would love to know other restaurants that do what Murgatroid does as well. I have to say that my favourite thing out of the take-out order is the squash soap. Simple yet tasty. The cookies and cinnamon rolls were okay for their prices but I've had better. The Murgatroid sandwich was a little cold by the time I got back to my office but it still tasted pretty fresh. The crispy chicken skin was a pleasant surprise and I would never have guessed what it was until my friends read the site's description.  I'm looking forward to trying this place again for brunch and hopefully I can give a better critique about the rest of their food."}
{"text":"Very nice place with amazing food. The owner is very passionate about his food. I really enjoy the time spent in here."}
{"text":"Pulled pork Benedict was out of this world delicious!!! Friendly family restaurant vibe with very good service!"}
{"text":"Amazon menu items and lovely local food. However, if you like me, like to start morning with something light, then it is probably not a good idea. I would ask the chef to get less salt and butter for me Oder next time ;)"}
{"text":"Came here to try their brunch, food was good. We ordered the breakfast burger, and the eggs benny. However it was just such a long wait and when we did get our dishes you can tell it was sitting there for awhile because it was warm and there was a layer of film ontop of the eggs benny's hollandaise sauce. The potatoes were really good. We came here with a deal, and this is definitely a good alternative to another brunch place however the super long wait is very discouraging to come back."}
{"text":"I'm always looking for new things opening in the neighbourhood so stopped in for some brunch on the weekend. First impressions upon walking in were good. Nicely reno'd space with cool art on the walls, nice reclaimed wood tables with small glasses of flowers on each, and groovey trip hop music playing. Very nice and inviting environment to be in.  The menu is admittedly a bit disjointed... They have a breakfast menu on a big chalkboard near the main counter/bar area. But when sitting at a table the menu delivered was a shortened brunch menu with only a handful of options. Once we established both menus were in play, things were moving forward productively.  Standard breakfast plate is $7.50 and eggs, bacon or sausage, and \"potato canoes\" which are essentially just potato wedges. It was all tasty but admittedly I'm not a fan of a breakfast that only includes 2 sausages when the defacto standard is usually 3 at least. Then lump in the fact that there was no toast or bread, this was not the most filling breakfast I've encountered. On the way out I noticed the chalkboard menu did have the options to add additional meat or even home cooked english muffins, but again with the disconnect of menus it was too late to capitalize on such an option.  It seems like most things are made in house including even their ketchup, so in the end while debating on a 3 or 4 star experience, I'm going to lean on the generous side as I'm sure with time this business will work through its initial issues and as they find their feet, it be a most welcome addition to the neighbourhood with some tasty food options."}
{"text":"Super friendly service and the food was just amazing!    Had the Murgatroid Brunch (chicken eggs Benny). Usually breakfast can be super salty but I'm surprised how well ever was seasoned.  Crispy chicken skin and the potatoes were absolutely the highlights of the dish.  Also had the Kale salad and again, very well seasoned.  What surprised me the most is that nothing was overly salty, which is what you usually come to expect with brunch.  Everything was perfectly balanced.    Service was absolutely on point!  Water glass was never empty.    Such a wonderful small, neighbourhood restaurant.  I will 100% be back because his is my favourite new brunch spot."}
{"text":"We had the Roast chicken benedict which was tasty, but absolutely in no way did it justify the $18 price point.   Also, Huevos Rancheros was so expensive and not worth it.   Portions are very, very small.   Will not be back."}
{"text":"I went for breakfast, and had the breakfast plate with a house-made English muffin. It was terrific! Service was quick and friendly, my meal came quickly, the coffee was bottomless. They didn't mind me lingering after my meal, which was nice! And the bacon was great - not everyplace does! The other menu items look really good, and the prices are fabulous. I totally recommend this place."}
{"text":"Murgatroid - the name reminds me of an evil robot in a sci-fi movie, and perhaps this is fitting because the food is out of this world! I purchased a groupon and had two brunch and two drinks for only $19. The prices would have been reasonable even without the groupon. We shared the Eggs Murgatroid and the Pigs in Blankets.   The Eggs Murgatroid was an interesting take on eggs benedict - it had a two house-made english muffins topped with chicken, crispy skin (tasted like that amazing Chinese pork skin you get from a whole roasted pig), poached eggs, and green onion. There were potato wedges on the side which were TO DIE FOR. The Pigs in Blankets dish featured three breakfast sausages wrapped in pancakes and two eggs on the side. The sausage-pancake-maple syrup combo was amazing. The eggs didn't need to be there because I was stuffed by the end of it! Coffee was delicious and bottomless, which I always appreciate in any brunch place.   Given that we went on a Friday morning, the place was pretty empty. The food took a while to come, but it was ultimately worth the wait because it was so good. I wonder if they would be able to keep up with a larger weekend crowd though. All in all, it was a fantastic brunch in the Wellesley-Parliament area, which in my opinion lacks great brunch places. Street parking was readily available. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"It was an excellent brunch. Had the egg mugatroid and judging by the name, it must be their specialty dish. So I must try it. It was delicious. The crispy skin adds some good texture and flavor."}
{"text":"I bought a groupon for this restaurant and brought my son for brunch. We were greeted by the server who's also the owner who also is the chef. We ordered eggs murgatriod and the special strawberry vanilla pancakes. Our meal was delicious. Everything was home made even the sourdough English muffins are freshly home made. They also have a shelf of games to play!"}
{"text":"Truthfully I've only had soup (excellent), I'd like to try everything I've seen pictured.  I like the owner; good dude trying to work it 'locally' (ingredients, etc).  Very nice interior, bright and clean.  Unfortunately challenging to see signage, too bad Under the Table downstairs wouldn't share the space (they have 2 outdated/ugly signs up), Cabbagetown already loves you Under the Table; share the love!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with the parents in town visiting. We were all very satisfied. First of they have proper loose leaf tea and bottomless locally roasted coffee. Between us we had healthy doses of their English muffins (delicious even plain + small batch jams), tomatoe soup, spiced pumpkin and apple pancakes, and a plump chicken sandwich. Very much appreciate the owner's commitment to sourcing locally produced food. Everything was truly delicious!"}
{"text":"Was curious about this place, walking past it many times before. Ended up waiting 20 minutes for a takeout lunch (huevos rancheros) while one person tried to do everything in the shop, alone. Food was average at best (black beans looked/tasted like they were from a can, soggy tortilla, etc). and still came to over $20 after tax... not nearly worth it. Won't go again."}
{"text":"Eggs Murgatroid is AMAZING! The coffee is surprisingly good. Nice medium sized place, very cozy."}
{"text":"Got brunch delivered from this place on a Sunday. Delivery was quick and the food was awesome. Best breakfast/brunch I've had in Toronto and they are doing it right. Can't wait to try the food in the actual restaurant."}
{"text":"I like Murgatroid - bright and light interior. Cheerful staff. Small menu, but everything we've had has been good. All the menu items are fairly standard but everything has an extra twist... My brunch favourite is the eggs Murgatroid - like eggs Benny but with chicken and crispy chicken skin and perfectly poached eggs. Excellent fluffy pancakes layered with caramelized apple was the special today. Love their canoe potatoes.  They are also able to cater to my daughter's gluten-free requirements."}
{"text":"Cute little place that serves delicious brunch. The staff is super nice and attentive. Would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"I came here for the very first time today for brunch with my boyfriend and his co-worker. I discovered this place as I was suffering on Yelp the other night looking for new brunch places to try. This place is located in Cabbagetown so it was walking distance from our condo. We got to the place around 11:30 am. The interior is not very big, but the seating was spacious enough that you don't feel as if you are crowded in your seat. The guys that worked here are super friendly and cheerful, which is very pleasant start to the brunch experience on a Sunday morning. I ordered the egg murgatroid and brewed coffee. My boyfriend ordered their ice tea and the Ploughman's Brunch. His co-worker ordered the breakfast sandwich and brewed coffee. I have to say the food was good and the portion size was just right. The coffee was freshly girded and brewed (just like I would at home). We also got 10% off on our bill for checking in on Yelp for the first time.   As we were settling our bill, we had a conversation with one of the guys and found out that everything on their menu, they make from scratch where possible, and the items they used are locally sourced where possible too.   I would definitely come back for brunch or even lunch and try out their lunch menu items."}
{"text":"Very cool and trendy spot in cabbage town. Went for brunch and Murgatroid did not disappoint. The eggs murgatroid is a must for any eggs Benedict fans, seems to be the staple on the breakfast menu. Other items we tried were the pigs in a blanket, cute concept having sausages wrapped in pancakes and a tortilla chip with eggs and bean dish, which name escapes me. The pigs in a blanket needed more syrup and the dish would have been a hit, was slightly dry. The Mexican dish was enjoyed by those who had it. Very cool vibes in this joint with board games to play if you're looking to hang out for a bit. We will definitely return to Murgatroid the next time we are in Cabbage town."}
{"text":"Great brunch today!  Eggs Murgatroid are something else.  The home  made English muffins made it even better.  Special pancakes with Apple and rhubarb were lovely too. Owner was very nice.  Prices  are fair,  not low and everything is local.  Well not the coffee I'm guessing but the food.  The brisket and grits special looked great too. All the specials looked good and there are several of them.  Excited to go back."}
{"text":"A gem of a place located in Cabbagetown.  They call themselves a \"Locavore Bistro\" and all of their food is locally sourced.  The service is friendly and the food excellent.  I love the \"Eggs Murgatroid\" a delightful twist on \"Eggs Benedict\".  My favorite is their canoe potatoes.  It is a place where the owner comes out of the kitchen at the end of your meal and asks you how you enjoyed the food and invites you to stay as long as you want."}
{"text":"Charming little brunch place in Cabbagetown. Owner was super nice and took time to chat. Highlights are the bottomless ice tea and homemade jam (grape and qince flavor, super good)   Ordered a basic breakfast and the food quality was  very very average with small portions. The table beside us finished their eggs Benny in literally under 10 mins and left. Bacon was overly crisp and dry, I had trouble chewing. Eggs were meh. Plating could use a bit of color (garnish, fruits??)   Charm/decor of the place definitely over promised on food quality."}
{"text":"HEAVENS TO MURGATROID (Did they name the restaurant after Snagglepuss's catchphrase?? Because I am super okay with that) THE FOOD HERE IS ASTOUNDING. I'm mainly speaking about the Eggs Murgatroid. I love the Eggs Murgatroid so much that I want to take it behind a middle school and get it pregnant. I am RIDE or DIE for Eggs Murgatroid. I F with Eggs Murgatroid HARD. It was seriously the best morning meal I have ever god damn had and I am still reeling from the effects Eggs Murgatroid had on my psyche.  I'm not sure you'll ever find a more perfect English muffin, forget everything you know about the dick-nut english muffins you buy at the supermarket, because Murgatroid English muffins are the real deal - home made - they are ridiculously fresh, fluffy and little perfect baked pillows of magic. The roasted chicken was moist and fabulous, it included white AND dark meat and somehow, as a INTENSE HATER of dark meat, I was still captivated full-stop. Poached egg was tight, perfectly runny, cripsy chicken skin artfully place on top of the whole deal and finally sealed with the top half of the english muffin.  UGH MY MOUTH IS WATERING JUST THINKING ABOUT THIS GODDESS OF A MEAL.  The hollandaise sauce was a little more runny than I'm used to...but you know what, fuck the noise that is mayonnaisey hollandaise sauce, if I wanted Mayo, I would have ordered god damn mayo...so perhaps a nice viscous hollandaise is where its actually at.  The canoe potatoes were awesome as well, perfectly cooked, flavorful, crispy skins and nice and mashy on the insides. MMMmmmmmm. I ordered their pickled plate - which was less STRICT PICKLES and more of an array of their fermented in house veggies (radish, onions, green beans and cucumbers) I mowed through that plate with absolute joy because vinegar is the best.  Service was whip-fast on a Sunday morning. Caleb was great at recommendations for a first timer and we felt very taken care of and welcomed. Big Ups to Luca the ~chef~ of the morning cause yea, my meal was magical, life-affirming and a GAME CHANGER to my breakfast/brunch worldview.  Murgatroid Forever."}
{"text":"I called to find out if the place is open for brunch on Monday morning, the guy answered the phone said with an annoyed voice that it would be open at 11 but we better come after 11:30.   Um no thanks. Weird."}
{"text":"Ambiance  I loved the rustic feel of the restaurant and the beautiful fresh flowers on every table. I also liked that you got a lot of natural light coming through the large windows.  Now to the actual brunch...  So on the day of the brunch, when we were seated at the table and Caleb brought out the first plate for us to share, my friend pointed out that unfortunately her food could not be touching bread. So all he had to do was put the bread in a small bowl rather than mix it all together on one plate. Plus, he did not have to do this with every plate, just the one she would be eating from (1/3 plates). However simple the request seemed, this was the exchange (note that it is not verbatim, but damn close):  Caleb/owner: \"You did not tell me that when we spoke on the phone.\"  My friend: \"I am sorry. I thought I did.\"  Caleb/owner: \"No, you did not tell me. When we spoke you should have told me this.\" As he grabbed the plate back and stomped away.  Me: \"Huh? Did he just chastise her? And did he just have a tantrum?\"  11 people looked at me and nodded.  My friends: \"Wow, I can't believe he just treated her like that! How rude!\"  Sigh. To say that I was embarrassed and regretting having chosen this restaurant is an under-statement. But it had to get better!  Food  We sampled (in the order of preference):  Pancakes (one stack shared between 6)-moist in the inside and crispy on the outside. Simply perfect. The ploughman's plate (one plate shared between 4)-I loved everything on the plate-the crackers, cheeses, chicken rilette, pickled vegetables, hummus (some plates had hummus and others had chicken rilette). The huevos rancheros (one plate shared between 6)-I love beans, tortillas and cheese. Enough said. Canoe potatoes (2 each)-I liked the crispy exterior and fluffy center-I also thought they were well-seasoned and the herbs accentuated the dish. Eggs Murgatroid (Benedict with chicken-each person got one egg on 1/2 of an English muffin)-loved the sourdough English muffin. I did not like that there was still fat on the chicken. Chewing on fat killed the dish for me. If the chicken had been shredded with more care, the dish would have been significantly more successful. Brisket and grits (day special)-I am not a fan of grits. I do not eat it when visiting the south (where grits are a staple), and don't care for it here in Canada. The dish was fine, and several of my guests enjoyed it, but I did not care for it.  Deal-breakers  One of my guests does not like runny yolks, and I did tell her that she should have told me in advance so that I could have communicated it to Caleb in advance. Nevertheless, I took her egg to Caleb and asked if it would be okay to have it cooked some more. He proceeded to tell me that he could not just throw it back in the boiling water, so he would have to make a whole new one. I tried to count to 10 in my mind and keep my cool.  Asking my table if we were still hungry and needed the next course. We had a deal, so honor it. Don't try to get out of it by implying that we should be full! We were starving! We were sharing one small dish between 4-6 people!  Dishes took a long time to come out. We were there from 11am-1:30pm-2.5 hours! We had to wait close to 30 minutes per dish. In other words, we cut one small dish into much smaller portions, eat it in 2 seconds, and then wait 30+ minutes for the next small plate to share. We certainly got plenty of time to digest each dish. Could that be why were still hungry? Probably!  We were using saucers as plates, and kept reusing the same saucer. When we asked if we could have new saucers to put our tiny portion of the pancakes on, he told us that we had all his saucers and that we would have to wait while he washed them. Was this communicated in a kind and professional way to us? Nope. It was our fault for being a big group using his limited dinnerware after all. What a nuisance we were! Huh?  At around 1pm we were all staring at each other wondering if there would be a last dish. We knew from the agreement we made that there should be a sweet dish. However, there was so much confusion and frustration in the room, that I had no idea what was happening. And to make matters worse, I did not want to be the one to ask. I generally lead and attend to any concerns my friends and I have when dining out, but with Caleb's attitude, I was afraid to approach him since there was a strong likelihood that an argument would ensue-he was rude not only to me but also my friends! No one insults my friends! So a friend decided to inquire on our behalf and learned that it would be another 15-20 minutes for the next dish. So unable to wait that long, one friend left without trying \"dessert.\" I asked her as she was leaving if Caleb had apologized to her when she went up to pay, or at least offered her a cookie, and she said no, he had not.

{"text":"They served us potato wedges and called them canoe potatoes. Food was tasty but too expensive. Owner made us fresh cookies. That was charming."}
{"text":"I had the fermented leek and wild mushroom omelette and it was the best breakfast I've had in Toronto.   Not a gigantic portion but everything was hot and fresh and potatoes crisp and golden and wonderfully seasoned. Everything just handmade and perfectly rich. Lets just say I left feeling satisfied... ;)   The mushrooms were out of control! I could really taste the earth. Mmmm... Earthy earth. Sign me up for the fungus! Amazing when one ingredient just snatches you up like that. Soaring through the air on a mushroom!   Not sure what's up with the name of this place tho. Ick. Certainly not as elegant and smooth as the delectable mushroom omlette I had that fine summer morning!"}
{"text":"It was a perfect breakfast. I ordered the eggs Murgatroid and my husband ordered the huevos rancheros.  We thought it was absolutely delicious!  We would definitely return."}
{"text":"Good food and friendly service! A relaxed place to pass a Saturday morning."}
{"text":"Weird name, boring menu, by far the slowest service I've ever had - even on a Saturday noon (brunch primetime), it was only 20% full. Drop list of 5 things that will kill this restaurant:  1) Slow service: my party waited an hour for our order while there was only around 5 other people in the restaurant (they also waited that long). 2) Inefficient ordering method: we had to walk up to the counter for the server to put down our order on an iPad - ever thought of just walking up to the tables?  3) Inefficient service: besides having an extremely low output rate, even the simplest of orders like yogurt parfait were left for the kitchen to make, while the two idle servers aimlessly engaged in chit chat 4) Quality (or style - it's really subjective): Brunch burger was oddly sweet, Eggs \"Murgatroid\" - simply an eggs benedict - had FULLY cooked eggs, no runny yolk. Really? You had ONE thing to do and you overcooked the eggs? 5) The name - need I say more?  Bad day or not, the quality of the food was consistently underwhelming, and borderline terrible for every single dish my party ordered. Sorry but not sorry!"}
{"text":"It's great to have a place to go to for good food with great ingredients.  Went there for an early dinner/ late lunch. Had the veggie sandwiches, one was hummus and the other a beet sandwich. The bread was fresh, along with the crisp lettuce and all the other ingredients. The beets were warm and garnished with a spicy spread, delicious. Will definitely come back to try their breakfast fare. Also had a very refreshing glass of home made iced tea, unsweetened just the way I like it. The service was good and everything looked clean and tidy."}
{"text":"A very good option for brunch.  The service was very friendly with the owner taking time to chat with us.  The food was hot and tasty.  They have some interesting menu choices, although somewhat limited.  I would like to return some time to try a sandwich for lunch.  It is a rustic, laid back place where you will feel comfortable and perhaps strike up a conversation with some other patrons, as we did."}
