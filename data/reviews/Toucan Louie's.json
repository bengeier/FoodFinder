{"text":"Really enjoyed the food and atmosphere. I had the pimento cheese steak sandwich with home fries. The price was was great considering the portion size. I was also very impressed with the pimento cheese. It was clearly freshly made. Overall an excellent meal at a good price. Plan to go back for breakfast sometime soon."}
{"text":"Great place in West Charlotte on Rozzelles Ferry Rd (down the road from Johnson C. Smith Univ). Great coffee place...they roast their own beans in house. Great sandwiches and snacks...including a juice bar with a bunch of delicious options. They carry all local/NC products...from eggs to popcorn to milk. They pride themselves on being sustainable with their products, down to the straws and cups! Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I had this place bookmarked for a while. I was able to go in with ease on a quiet Saturday afternoon. The lady behind the counter was very helpful. She explained the menu to me and also let me sample a few things. I finally decided on the shrimp salad sandwich and the 3 cheese mac and cheese. I also purchased a container of jerk chicken salad to save for later. I am not a soda drinker and not big on sweet tea at all. But she let me taste their peach green tea...HONEY!!!!!! It was delicious! And they have the good ice!!!!! They sell it in 10lb bags too.   I was able to meet and talk to the owner Marc, and his manager who runs the place BB. Both were very nice and pleasant. I shall return to check this place out some more!!!"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the coffee and sandwich description.  This place makes legitimate from scratch food from locally sourced ingredients. On the weekend they have a full menu of breakfast items including french toast, benedict, beakfast meats, etc.  We had the Cuban sandwich and the jerk chicken salad sandwich which were tasty and fresh for lunch.  A few days later had the Gouda, egg, and avocado sandwich and the egg/meat/home fries for breakfast which was outstanding. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"We are so excited to have Toucan Louie's in the neighborhood!! I'm currently sitting on my couch drinking their breakfast blend coffee and it's excellent! We have tried their espresso drinks and breakfast and lunch sandwiches as well. Definitely get the one with goat cheese or their homemade pimento cheese. Their toasted roll is SO good. My only constructive criticism is that both their almond milk and coconut milk lattes were not good. The coconut milk latte was overwhelmingly coconut-y and greasy. The almond milk latte tasted off and like it was a day or two old. But this was also during soft opening so I'm willing to retry!"}
{"text":"Perfect for the way I am eating. Love their Congee with sweet potato, coconut and pistachios. Their selections are mostly NC local, homemade granola, freshly roasted coffee with grass fed milk."}
{"text":"The have the most awesome Cuban sandwich around. Very nice add to the west side. Good luck."}
{"text":"Wow! What a cute little spot. So many NC snacks, beers, and coffee. I had the barbecue Cuban sandwich and tried the That's Gouda. The Cuban has a delicious sweet slaw with pineapple, yum. The Gouda was delicious as well. The buns are fresh and soft.  The owner greeted us when we came in and explained all of the fantastic, sustainable practices and in-house roasted coffees.  The patio is cozy but does not, currently, have shade.  Seriously awesome place with great prices."}
{"text":"Wow! What a great little spot.  I stumbled onto this place while on a morning bike ride.  What a true hidden gem!  Best of luck to you all."}
{"text":"This is a really cool place.  I love that they promote and make local small business apart of their space. The staff is very friendly and helpful to first timers who are trying to get the full experience.  The food is amazing and this will be on my list of frequents as we move into spring. Smoothies all summer long.. so excited"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today - great place and I love the ideas and menu.  Perfect place for the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Great little find this weekend. They use mostly locally sourced products and make as much in house as they can, including roasting their own coffee."}
{"text":"Everything I have had here has been absolutely delicious!   The Spinach Sweet Potato salad tastes phenomenal and is the perfect balance of ingredients; you can tell the spinach is fresh & clean, the small diced sweet potato bites are prepared perfectly, bacon is always a welcomed addition to anything I have on my plate, the candied pecans add a touch of sweetness, and the goat cheese adds just enough creaminess and moisture that I didn't even need to use the balsamic vinaigrette that the lovely worker recommended. If you really feel like taking it to the next level order 8oz of the Shrimp Salad for only $4.95. Completely worth it!   If you're in the mood for a healthy pick me up, give the Greendrink 12oz juice a try! They make it right in front of you so you can see all the whole fruits and veggies going into your drink. And despite the green appearance that might make you question your order, it is very tasty and then you can skip your workout that day! ;)   While i was there they also offered me a handful of samples which was wonderful, so I also tried the Freekah (quinoa medley), cucumber salad, and pimento cheese!! All were delicious of course! I can't wait to go back again to try every single breakfast items, all the burgers, and anything with pimento cheese on it!   Also, the staff was super friendly with great recommendations!! The women at the register had gorgeous natural red hair. And the nice woman in the kitchen was very quick!"}
{"text":"Cute little spot in West Charlotte. Stopped in on a Sunday morning to grab coffee and ended up getting lunch as well. The employees were very friendly and accommodating. The place wasn't busy at all so we were served quickly. We ordered a bacon egg and cheese sandwich, pimento cheese sandwich, Toucan Fogger, and a vanilla iced coffee. I loved my pimento cheese sandwich. I asked for it melted, it was delicious. The tomato and lettuce were fresh. The bread wasn't over toasted. The BEC sandwich was good but could have been made better of the bacon was crispy, my husband ended up taking all of it off because it was just fat. The toucan fogger smoothie is good and I liked the ice coffee."}
{"text":"Great for lunch!  Cuban was Delish! The staff was great and welcoming. A little off the beaten path but I love places like this.  I will definitely come back to try some of the other options they have for sandwiches."}
{"text":"First experience is extremely positive. I live in the neighborhood and is a great feeling to have neat places pop up close by.   First impression - this is a shack. Boy was i wrong. Out came delicious smoothies, exquisite lattes, fresh pressed peanut butter, pimiento cheese spread, hummus, and more. The owner and family was there assisting the employees tackle orders and requests. Live music was on stage. Outdoor area was kid and dog friendly. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"The service this morning was nice and inviting. Christy served us with kindness and patience. This is my new favorite for coffee and breakfast"}
{"text":"Had to give a shout out to the owner, Mark, who hand delivered an order to Blue Blaze Brewery yesterday during their new beer launch! Had a delicious pimento cheesesteak sandwich and kettle chips (jalepe√±o and queso!).   They technically don't deliver but I'll keep coming back here for the great food and the amazing customer service!"}
{"text":"I really like this place! I discovered Toucan Louie's when they provided lunch  for a Yelp event. I was so impressed with the presentation (and taste, of course) that I just had to check it out. They were even kind enough to provide alternative items for my lunch (aside from everyone else's) due to food allergies. Also,at the event we were informed that this place pretty much tries to use all fresh/locally-made products and that many of the items they prepare with can be purchased at the restaurant.  I visited on a late Sunday afternoon so there were a few people in/out. The guy taking orders was very polite and service was quick. I ordered a turkey sandwich with hummus and goat cheese. The best way I can describe both sandwiches that I have had from them is wholesome, as in filling and delicious. The bread that I had both times is the perfect combo of toasted, but soft. The bread also has an addictive buttery taste (the bread was a strong factor in my visit. Yes, that good and i like bread).The Turkey was perfectly tender and the hummus, so full of flavor. I purchased a tub to-go.  When I used it to make a sandwich the next day, it really gives the kick that I didn't realize was missing (eh, lunch was getting boring). Honestly, I like it more than any hummus I have ever tasted.   Anyway, I am looking forward to trying out some more stuff from here in the very near future and often. I found the layout of the restaurant to be adorable. It is small, but think cozy/quaint instead of cramped. They have  really done well in maximizing the space. There is table seating as well as bar stools facing the window. There was  also some table-top/card games available. This place gives me the feel of simpler times... It definitely has a little something for everyone's taste buds."}
{"text":"Grand opening today at TL! Soft opening happened last month in December. Met the owners wife today, so friendly and about this neighborhood! (LOVE) located here in west end in Biddleville! Happy to see more cool lil places starting to pop up around here.   Toucan Louie's named after their dog, Louie.   So today for grand opening they gave away some coffee beans, whoop whoop! And some samples. I tried: their in house pilmento cheese SO GOOD. In house peanut butter which is also good. Hummus, granola, jams, and honey. I recommend their strawberry lavender honey which they sell from a local vender (all jams that is).   Decent selection of canned beer here in their coolers. Otherwise you can find all natural juices (decently priced for 12 oz $4.95-$6.95), coffee, burgers and sandwiches.   Cafe & Roastery  Good vibes here. Boardgames. Friendly/inviting atmosphere. Reminds me of a smaller rhino market."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff!!!  The pimento and egg sandwich for breakfast is yummy and the pimento cheese steak for lunch is yummy!!"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of attending a Yelp Elite event where Toucan's catered our lunch. I was very impressed with all of the proper presentation and wrapping of each item in our reusable bag. The attention to detail is something I appreciate being the the meeting coordination industry. The sandwich was absolutely delicious and fresh. You can completely tell they roast their turkey breast onsite and it was not dry. The bread they used was also very good which is a big component to the sandwich as well. The fruit with lavender syrup was such a nice touch. I have a lot of corporate catered events for work and plan on reaching out for assistance in the future."}
{"text":"I ordered the French toast with home fries that come with peppers and onions. It was DELICIOUS. The staff was awesome and the environment is chill and laid back. Great place for food with friends."}
{"text":"Veggie Hummus sandwich is Amazing!!! Definitely looking forward to trying one of their all natural smoothies and the Shrimp salad sandwich next on my list."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are amazing! Such a great addition to west Charlotte. Pimento and chimichurri sandwiches are delicious. Very great price and can't wait to try their breakfast sandwich next."}
{"text":"I'm really excited for this place! The Westside has been in need of a good market/deli/coffee place and this place is all of that! My fiance brought me on a Sunday morning and we ordered breakfast food, but the deli area is open all day long and serves a variety of sandwiches too. Parking is minimal, but there is a dirt lot out back that we parked in and didn't have any issues.  I ordered the Twisted Goat breakfast sandwich, which is spinach, egg, roasted red peppers, mushrooms and goat cheese on a roll. If you like goat cheese, you will like this sandwich. The cheese is very creamy (local!) and blends well with the other breakfast flavors. They had also just started offering a combo deal that included their homefries and a coffee. The homefries were also great! They were big chunks of potato roasted with peppers and onions, like a cheesesteak :)  I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Really convenient little market making some delicious smoothies and sandwiches friendly staff and awesome service!"}
{"text":"Great little breakfast and sandwich joint. Very nice and the pimento and egg BLT was very good."}
{"text":"Great place and great food. Orders the jerk chicken salad sandwich, Mac and cheese along with an apple berry smoothie. Not disappointed with any of it. Would def go back and try some more!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Simple and easy ingredients! Staff is a pleasure and the store is great :) good up the appeal and good food!"}
{"text":"Awesome!!  I had the jerk chicken salad sandwich!!  With cucumber salad, jicama slaw and fruit cup!  All were amazing. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Very nice place.   Great food  and friendly staff.    I had the pimento steak sandwich and it was amazing.    What else is there to say."}
{"text":"The sandwiches were fresh and delicious and made to order. Stay away with it accommodates some of my special request and that is always a nice thing!"}
{"text":"This is the kind of place we should all eat at. Folks who care about the quality of your food and beverages as well as care about supporting the local community. As more and more \"chain restaurants\" appear on the horizon, there are always places to eat, but are those the places you WANT to eat at? Not always. I was in town on business and once again Yelp gave me my dinner spot - this time it was Toucan Louies. What an amazing Mediterranean salad!!  The dressing is tasty and loaded with dill. It was luscious. The veggie hummus sandwich was a taste treat as well. I ate here 2 out of my 3 nights in town, and I'm making this my \"GoTo\" food stop whenever I'm back in Charlotte. C'mon west side - support this place - you'll be glad you did!!!  The coffee is awesome too!!!"}
{"text":"Toucan Louie's is the type of place that the West End needed, and frankly I'd like to see more of around Charlotte. Market places with deli counters that get food and atmosphere right become hangouts - and I'm so glad we're within 10 minutes of this place. It's located a bit north of Five Points, and my only gripe about the location is the lack of parking (6 parking spaces total, although there is a gravel lot out back... not sure if it was okay to park there, but that definitely didn't stop us, nor did we get towed haha)...  Walking in, you're met with a super bright interior and a good number of tables. The market area is lined with coolers and shelves of local products, mostly NC, some even donate to charities like the chips! The menu is extensive and features ALL local made products. Everything from the meats, to the cheeses, to breads, to pickles, to the people sitting there reading the paper. It's all local. I ordered the That's Gouda breakfast sandwich which had ham, avocado (side note, I'm not able to say that word without thinking about the video of the little boy opening his Christmas present), gouda, and some other yummies. We were upsold to a combo (new!) which included coffee and homefries. The meal was affordable, filling, and most of all absolutely delicious. The homefries had peppers and were seasoned beautifully, it was just great.   Because of the market aspect and the rest of the menu that I've still yet to try, I absolutely cannot wait to return!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to LOVE this place, but I only LIKE it.  Here is the scoop.... I first visited this place not terribly long after it opened.  The coffee was great, the food was all messed up though.  I ordered a pimento sandwich and they literally didn't put the items on it as indicated on their menu, they only put pimento cheese.  I didn't complain, I just ate it with the mindset that they were new.    My next experience was the same.  I ordered scrambled eggs with cheese, and they literally just placed a slice of cheese on top of the already scrambled eggs.  Presentation is everything, well along with taste of course, and it had neither of those things.  The french toast was okay, after being drowned in what I was told to be maple syrup.  Jury is still out on that one.    They have a few random and sparsely stocked shelves of local items which feel out of place.  They should really rethink the floor plan, especially the shelves.  It has a gas station vibe instead of a cafe.   Long story short, they have enormous potential to really make this great, but it all starts in the kitchen.  I'm keeping my fingers crossed they can listen to feedback and really make this place a hot spot in the community with lines out of the door."}
{"text":"What a gem to find. Was passing through and found them via my phone. Everyone that worked there seemed happy to be there and super friendly.  Homemade goods. Quick in and out, bright and airy vibe. I don't live nearby, but I will be back! Bonus: super close to Blue Blaze Brewery and even deliver there :)"}
