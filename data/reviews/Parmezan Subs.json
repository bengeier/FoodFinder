{"text":"The Godfather sandwich made me see God. Every piece of meat and cheese is overflowing with flavor. Even the lettuce is delicious, as it is covered in an Italian dressing that adds to the overall greatness of the sub. You won't be disapointed by any of the menu items here."}
{"text":"Love this place but for the past fifteen minutes I've called twenty times and no one has answered. The food is great tho"}
{"text":"Open only since October 2014, Parmezan Subs closed on August 24 and is now out of business. All the restaurant furniture has been sold off and there are no plans to reopen. I spoke on the phone with owner Chris Eissler, who told me his wife Zuzana has returned to her native Hungary for the time being, and he is not sure what lies ahead for him. It was a really nice place to have a great meal."}
{"text":"Good fresh sub sandwich made with quality ingredients. PRICEY for the portion size.Will probably try it again to see if other items on the menu are good.Always like new restaurants opening in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place cause it's a local business, but in all honesty, the food was not good. The fries were swimming in grease and tasted like salt. The chicken parm sub consisted of extremely dry and flavorless chicken smothered in marinara sauce and cheese on top of really hard bread. The sub alone costed $15, which is pretty steep for something that I likely could have made better at home."}
{"text":"The food is perfect. Had Mothers Day brunch and the food was great. The Cesar Salad was just amazing. I would recommend  this place to anyone! Food is just great, and service was perfect."}
{"text":"do not do not eat here. rude customer service. my chicken parmezan sub was not good. the bread was hard and the chicken was tough. not too sure if it was because it was the end of the night. but my family and i will never come back to this place."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, casual atmosphere, good service!
Husband got the underboss sub, looked incredible! I had the chicken parm sub.... Excellent! Will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"My husband and I know the owner, personally. Great food.   Love the house side salad. Very clean environment, very welcoming. Like that they have daily specials. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"My daughter took me to Parmezan for Mother's Day brunch. It was fabulous! The variety of dishes was amazing. Each entree was top quality and delicious. The deserts were extravagant and baked to perfection. This was a 5 star brunch for a bargain price.

{"text":"Absolutely love this place!  I have tried several things on their menu and loved them all!  Also their staff is so friendly and accommodating.   I have really enjoyed going there!"}
{"text":"Food is incredible! Owner is a past executive chef on the Strip. He knows good food fast! Makes his own bread, sauces, cannoli and pastries - the best! Price is right and the restaurant is spotless - overall fantastic experience!"}
{"text":"Great friendly service. Very good priced items. Chicken Parmezan delicious, penne marinara great, broccoli cooked perfectly , bruschetta with perfect amount of garlic, cannoli very tasty. This restaurant is here to stay! :) Dine in, carry out, catering. Breakfast, lunch and dinner. The owners Chris and Zuzana are awesome! Will go there again for sure!"}
{"text":"first time there tonight,being from new york i know great italian food,i had the chicken parm with pene & soup. the owners & the people that work there are very nice.will definitely be back real soon for another great meal."}
{"text":"Only been here twice, the first time I had their minestrone soup, so good. Very tomatoie with great veggies. My husband had the meatball sub. It was huge with great big meatballs, provolone cheese and great bread! Our second visit was disappointing. My buffalo chicken wrap was too salty to eat. I think it was the buffalo sauce. My husbands Philly cheese steak was  disappointing, the meat was not up to snuff. Sadly this place lacks consistency."}
{"text":"Awesome spot, I keep coming back for more. Had the meatball like ten times and the pasta and knots are awesome also and to top it off the owner is super friendly and sociable."}
{"text":"2nd time here, 1st time for food and it was quite, quite good!!!! Ordered the entree size portion which was a GIGANTIC.....my order was Baked Penne, tasty tomato sauce with ricotta cheese, an plenty of it~ Which I LIKE, BTW!!!!!!
     Truly huge portion served with bread which was good, however had it had been served hot it would have been excellent. I could have asked and I'am sure they would have heated it up,
      I bought a small cannoli chocolate coated, YUMMMM! For later tonight soooo I will add comments AFTER it is consumed.
     I have to mention that my very first visit was to have their coffee......possibly one of the BEST COFFEES in the valley~such a rich, creamy cup of Italian coffee  I will warn you in advance .....its STRONG, just like what you get in Italy. 
   Ciao Bella"}
{"text":"My husband and I think this is the best Italian food to go. We love ordering, chicken parmesan entree and veggie chopped salad.  I'm always grabbing take out.  I want to give this great food restaurant more business. BUT I've called on 3 different days to order take out and not once have they picked up their phone. I like to put in my order and for it to be ready.   I don't want to give up on this place.  Please answer your phone for take out orders.   I will be back if you pick up.  I have referred several friends and they have dined in and loved it."}
{"text":"Nice place with not allot of hooplah. Not exactly fast food or full restaurant.       Fettuccine Alfredo and chicken parmesan were tasty.   Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Stopped by here to try out a Philly cheese steak, but i was disappointed with the quality. I ordered a medium cheese steak with sharp provolone. When I got the order it was just regular provolone and there was barely any meat on it. It was full of mayo, onions and peppers. I would recommend going to capriotis or east coast eats of a real Philly cheese steak. 

Prices are bit high for what you are getting, but the staff is very friendly. Desserts also looked good."}
{"text":"Heard about this little Italian spot from my friend in Henderson and had to check it out. I decided on the chicken francese sub with the penne alla vodka sauce which was probably the best I have had in the city. I respect when someone takes the time to make everything homemade. Cannolis had a lemony taste which was AMAZING. I will be making the drive across town to eat here again!"}
{"text":"Ventured over to Parmezan Subs one day for lunch with friends from work. I ordered the large chicken parm sub and a large fountain drink. The sandwich was actually very good, perfect amount of chicken, marinara sauce and cheese. The bread was toasted and crusty on the outside yet soft and warm inside. I have been back since my first visit and tried the meatball parm, it was ok, not a huge fan of their meatballs 
(I love the larger style meatballs, these are kinda small). The marinara here is some of my favorite ever, it has a hint of roasted red peppers in it that gives it a very unique flavor, I order a small side of it when ever I eat here now just so I can add extra to my sandwich! 

I recommend everyone to give this place a shot, good food,, friendly staff and they keep the place very clean!"}
{"text":"Good food but WAY too expensive. I bought the eggplant parm sub and it was delicious, however the price of the food and drink was just ridiculous. I spent $18.00 just for myself on just that. I think that if they lowered their prices a bit, they'd be a lot better in my opinion. Otherwise, they have a coke freestyle machine, a dessert bar with gelato, and coffee which all seemed pretty nice. In terms of food 4/5. In terms of atmosphere 4/5. In terms of price 1/5."}
{"text":"Great service and the best subs I've had in a long time. Both the Chicken Parm and Meatball Parm were delicious."}
{"text":"Chris really knows what he's doing.  This place is very nice!  The atmosphere is cool, quaint and quiet.  The food is REALLY good!  After eating there once we had him cater a party with Chicken Parm.  SOLID.  Just GO! His deserts are some of the best in town."}
{"text":"Pretty good.  No complaints.  Food was tasty.  No complaints.  Had sandwiches, will need to try dinner soon."}
{"text":"My son loves the Alfredo pasta! Smells yummy! Great service and great atmosphere! Definitely stop and check this place out!"}
{"text":"Anybody can make a meatball sandwich. It is a staple of any sandwich shop.  Most places they are mediocre.  This is not the case.  One of the best meatball subs I have had in a long time.  The fresh tomatoes in the sauce set the tone.  Fresh, robust flavors through every bite.  We will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Good not great.  I had the Underboss sub.  It tasted good and the bread was very fresh but the value wasn't there.  It had a big shortage of meat."}
{"text":"Great meatball sub. Head Chef Chris rocks out some good food. Atmosphere is very inviting, and the staff was very friendly. Excited to go back and try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Ok I gotta say this place is awesome!  This time we ordered eggplant parm sub, kids chicken fingers and fries, chocolate cannoli, penne alla vodka, and zeppoli. Probably the best eggplant parm I've ever had. Everything tastes home made, even the fries and chicken fingers, which we order a lot with a 3 year old.  This was the first time I have ever had a zeppoli and I can say I'm a fan. Not greasy or too sweet. Perfect!  Even my picky daughter loved them and wanted more. Doesn't hurt that this place also delivers!!  Looking forward to my next order. Finally a great Italian restaurant in Henderson"}
{"text":"I can not rave enough about this place. I have tried both the shrimp and eggplant parm sandwiches, as well as their fries, and they were all phenomenal. I have since been craving it every day! The fact that they deliver is an extra plus. I will be ordering and visiting regularly! I can't wait to try more items on their menu!!"}
{"text":"For our first visit we had the fetaccini alfredo with sausage, a hot italian sausage sub and fries. They've got a great thing going on in there! The atmosphere is great...and the coffee is perfect! Nice job, Coach!"}
{"text":"The Under Boss sub was excellent. The roll was really fresh and tasty. The onion rings were fresh, not frozen. Always a plus and really good."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to write a bad review since the restaurant is new, but we paid close to $20 for a giant Parmesan chicken sandwich that was barely edible. First off, the chicken was cold, tasteless, and was hard like it had been cooked for quite a while before we ordered it. Secondly, the chicken wasn't any different than the breaded frozen chicken tenderloins that you can purchase at Sam's club. Finally, one would think that a place named Parmezan Subs would specialize in Parmesan Chicken Subs and that this particular item on the menu would be a safe bet for flavor and value. Not so...

It's too bad because we really liked the hostess who greeted us and told us that they'd only been open for 8 days so far. Sorry to say we won't be giving them another try."}
{"text":"This is an easy 5 star review. I called them ( via Bluetooth) on my way home from work on Superbowl Sunday at around 2:45. I placed my order with a few suggestions from the person on the other end. By kickoff my doorbell rang and the most amazing smell was being handed to me just in time for the game. So, they saved my last minute Superbowl plans, they delivered quickly, and the food tasted great. I'm not really sure what else needs to be said."}
{"text":"Went for lunch...it took one of the three people working behind the counter a solid five minutes to say \"hello.\" We eventually placed our order when he was ready to take it...we were the only eat-in customers when we sat down. We waited for a verrry long time for our food...two of the three meals came out, the third was easily another ten + minute wait...and it was just a ham and mozzarella Panini...The whole vibe was odd...people coming and going from the back...no niceties at all. I don't recall a \" thank you\" at any point in the transaction...the food was dropped on our table with an awkwardness. It felt as if we walked into a private club to which we were not invited. They seemed to be doing a bigger take out / pick up business and maybe can care less about dining in customers. The tables were hodge podge, they were not clean and when we left, one of the men who I assumed worked there cuz he brought over some of our food to us while wearing a t-shirt, basketball shorts and flip flops looked right at us as we left and did not even throw a \"thanks\" or \"goodbye\" our way. Creepy experience all around...we won't be back..."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Parmezan. Both times my boyfriend and I got subs not entrees so this review is only based on their subs. The first time we went here,  we ordered chicken parm subs. We both felt the portion size was small and overpriced for what you get. The sub itself had good flavor. They cut the ends off the sub rolls which I really do not prefer. This time we ordered their version of an Italian sub, a $15 sub. The portion size was good, they still cut the ends off the sub roll but it didn't taste like an Italian sub should and for $15, not worth it. We also ordered a side of meatballs. That was enough to make us never comeback. Side of meatballs was 4 little meatballs which really would be 1 meatball and a half if they were normal size. They were gross. I'm  pretty sure they didn't make them because they had that awful rubbery, fake consistency of the frozen meatballs that you buy at the supermarket. Just weird and your not even sure that they are meat. Maybe the entrees are better,  but I won't be coming back to find out."}
{"text":"Came for a catered company Christmas party. Restaurant is very nice and has a Coca Cola Freestyle machine! Chicken marsala was probably the best I've ever had. Everything else was great but that was exceptional! Try the little meatball subs too! Owner is very nice."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic.  Great atmosphere and staff.  The tables have lit candles and some fine dining music is playing.  They have daily specials. If you happen to visit on a night where their special is the Rigatoni Bolognese, do not pass it up.  It is fantastic. 

My wife and I each tried their salads.  The Cesar and the Chopped Italian salad are fantastic.  All portions are large in comparison to most restaurants.  

We didn't get to try the deserts this time around but they look incredible. 

Definitely will return."}
{"text":"The chef rocks out some awesome minestrone soup! Very flavorful. I had the meatball parmezan sub. Wow the sauce is perfect and the meatballs were tender the fresh crusty bread was the perfect sandwich and the use of good quality ingredients, u can taste .  You can tell a lot of love went into the food.  I can't wait to try a few other things on the menu.  I'm glad they do dilvery in my neighborhood. It's a great addition to are area. The owner was very freindly and u can tell they have been in the industry a long time."}
{"text":"So sad to see that Parmezan Subs closed. We always enjoyed the friendliness of the owner and staff as soon as you entered the restaurant and will miss the food very much."}
{"text":"Best meatball sub I have had in a very long time.  Definitely want to try the God Father next time I am in.  The cakes in the display case are incredible as is the Italian ice  I haven't had one of those since I was a kid.  This place is definitely worth giving a try."}
{"text":"The place is clean and casual. The food aroma is fantastic and the staff was friendly. We ordered take-out and the food was ready within 15 minutes of placing our order over the phone. I got the meatball sub (medium) which was plenty filling and was delicious. Not too much sauce and just enough cheese. I also got the Italian chopped salad which was surprisingly good. I would be happy just with the salad.
The prices are reasonable and the location is nice but a bit tucked away. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great locally owned restaurant! Chicken parm sub, meatball subs, house salad and even the fries are so delicious!! We have visited many times! Clean and family friendly"}
{"text":"Magnificent food selections and the taste is just like your in Italy.  Chris, the head chef is a masterpiece at what he does, creates delicious dishes that is exactly like my Italian  Mom would make, everything in the restaurant is homemade.  We will definitely come back again!!!"}
{"text":"best Italian restaurant 
amazing and fresh canolis and brownies the food is always great and we come almost every day!"}
{"text":"Cool local place with a decent selection of hot and cold sandwiches.
Not much ambiance inside (typical sandwich place), so you probably wanna take your stuff to go.
So far I've only tried the underboss (Italian sub with lots of good stuff on it). I really liked all the toppings, good amount of meat, large (probably about 10\" long) was $8.
I plan to return to check out the cheesesteaks."}
{"text":"Just discovered a hidden treasure. I haven't had a meatball sub this good since I was back in Little Italy. The shop is a family run business and the owner, Chris, came out to greet us and check on us during our meal. I can't wait to try more of their food....it's so good even the Corleone's would eat here! 'Leave the gun, take the cannoli'"}
{"text":"Without a doubt, one of the best eateries in the Las Vegas/Henderson area.  This \"sub\" shop has much more than meets the eye.  The Rigatoni Bolognese and the Chicken Francese are our regular fare but my wife has tried a number of different dishes that she loves.  This little hole in the wall specializes in take-out food and catering, as well as having seating for about 60 people for dining in service.  Everything is home-made at Parmezan Subs

If you are looking for takeout food or a casual place to hang out and grab a quick bite before going out, this place should not be missed!!!  Oh...Parmezans is also open for lunch.

Greeters - N/A
Wait staff/counter - 5 Stars (very friendly staff)
Food - 5 Stars
Dessert - 5 Stars
Ambiance - 4 Stars (above average for a sub shop)
Pricing - $$ ($30 for two people...but huge portions)

Overall - 5 Stars"}
{"text":"My 9 year is a pasta/meatball connoisseur, which he takes very seriously. He always prefers the family operated places. Sadly, his last two favorites closed. However... He has a new favorite, and lucky for me, it's in the neighborhood.  The marinara sauce is so fresh and bright and delicious. The meatballs are just perfect. The bread is baked fresh. And the service is outstanding. Everything a neighborhood place should be! The menu offers a huge variety. It will take us awhile to try it all. You are missing out if you don't give this place a try."}
{"text":"Really good chicken Parmesan! Good service and great menu. Very surprised with the desserts too!"}
{"text":"I am so glad I decided to try this place out. It has a very low key casual atmosphere. Nothing fancy but more like going to your family's house for Sunday dinner. I ordered linguine marinara with meatballs, minestrone soup, and a side chopped salad. The pasta was perfectly cooked. the marinara sauce was on point with the flavor, perfectly seasoned. The meatballs are by far the best I have had in Las Vegas and dare I say ever?  The minestrone soup could have been a meal all on its own. So rich and full of flavor. You don't miss the lack of meat in that soup at all! The salad was pretty good as well. Crisp fresh veggies. And you get a little side of bread with your order. If you are in the anthem/Henderson area check this place out! You will be very glad you did. I live on the strip and I will definitely be making the drive to this side of town to enjoy this amazing food!"}
{"text":"great casual Italian food, very casual. Service is always friendly and attentive. Their salads are fresh and made to order, definitely try the chopped salad. We have had their pasta along with their hot subs. The pasta is fresh and sauce is delicious. And you have to have one of their subs my favorite is the meatball sub. Fresh meatballs plenty of sauce all served on what can only be a freshly baked roll."}
{"text":"Got some sammies to go.  Lil pricey....I got the large Sausage and peppers sandwich.  Good and tasty but pretty messy. Taste was great but for the price it could of been bigger.  Hate to compare a place to Capriaottis but they do give you a good size for the price. I will go back......if I got a coupon or two for one groupon type deal."}
{"text":"Great place! I'm new to the area and I wanted a sub, so leave it to yelp to strike again!! This place is great! Friendly staff, and food?! Awesome! I had the Philly Cheez Steak with Mozzarella and its sooo good! I also had the Zucchini sticks...which are actually round! Lol, but really good! Not greasy like some fried zucchini I've had....just plain good! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"My panini was flavorful and delicious. The chopped salad is one of the best I have ever had. Ended a great meal with a huge cannoli. Had a great meal at a great location."}
{"text":"That all you can eat thing is a joke. For 12 dollars yes you get unlimited pasta but it's not an exaggeration to say it came straight from a can of Prego. There is no protein in the pasta, straight up noodles and sauce. The caesar salad is probably one of the worst I've had in recent memory, only good thing was bread and butter.

Service wise the cashier was nice but slow, I'm assuming due to a new location she took a while to get the order from the first guest. The head chef in the back is practically yelling at another worker in the back, something that shouldn't be done in plain view. Anyways long story short the pasta sucks try something else."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!!!! Friendly staff and made a smaller penne pasta portion for my son he was craving pasta tonight.  The pasta and sausage my husband ordered was incredible and the Italian chopped salad was to die for I haven't had a salad that good in a long time. My daughter loves the fries and we have yet to eat the tiramisu but I am sure it will be fantastic!!!! Thanks for an awesome experience we will definitely be back soon!!!! Great atmosphere awesome food!!!!"}
{"text":"Food so good. Get in my belly. Made the drive out here from Southwest side of town with a buddy. Worth it.

The owner's name is Chris, super awesome guy. He came out and checked out our car too haha. 

Come here and feast!"}
{"text":"A delightful family owned Italian restaurant cloaked as a sub shop!!!! 

Menu is extensive filled lots of delicious subs, pastas, and desserts!
My favorite is the Rigatoni Bolognese, Chicken and Meatball subs.
I haven't tried the other subs yet, so that's reason for me to go back.

The owner/chef makes everything from scratch and the sauce is genuine!
Suzanna (co-owner) is a great host, she's very kind and knowlegable.


Recommended Indeed!!"}
{"text":"The chicken cordon Bleu panini... yum! The soups I've tried are also very good. They come with fresh warm bread. Friendly staff and clean. They are definitely more than just a sandwich place."}
{"text":"So I have tried to order from this place 2x once I drove up and it was closed mid day and now I am trying to call to place an order and once again no answer? Are they really ever open??

Update: I have tried to call again and still no answer and yelp says it's open.  Won't try again  lost a customer ."}
{"text":"Amazing food!  Better sandwitches here than any other neighborhood place. Yes, they are a little pricey, but you get what you pay for. The Grande Chicken Franchese is well worth the price. Try it!"}
{"text":"My family and I wanted to order dinner from here, the website, yelp, and good says they are open till 8 pm but when you call it says they are closed Sunday's."}
{"text":"There is some good and some bad about this place.
First, they use quality ingredients and make their own pasta (according to them).
They do Cannoli's right, having the shells in the glass and adding the filling when it is ordered.
The staff is friendly and helpful.
We ordered chicken parmesan pasta (it came with ziti), mozzerella sticks and a Chicken Francese sub.  THe chicken parm was good but a bit oversauced.  Still it had great flavor and was moist and tender.  A good size portion that will make for a great leftover lunch the next day.
The mozzarella sticks were lightly breaded and cooked perfectly with a marinara dipping sauce.
The chicken Francese sub was a bit of a let down. 1) it is heavily sauced so makes for a messy sub. 2) the bread was not very good, tasting almost stale and chewy.  The flavor was very good and the chicken was cooked well but I think I would not get a sub the next time I was here.  Perhaps I just don't like the bread they use.

Still the food itself is very good!"}
{"text":"The chicken parm sandwich is incredible. The bread is crusty outside and soft inside! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Driving through an area of town, where we normally aren't, looking for food, without a preference, my wife and I both spotted a sign for PameZan Subs at the same time. Hooking a quick U-turn, we pulled into the parking lot and almost didn't go in. 

The front doors were both propped open, an extension cord was through the entrance, to where staff members were hanging a sign/banner on the side of the building. Not sure if they were actually open, or almost ready for business, we walked in, and were prepared to have to leave.

A nice lady walked in, and had someone who was still on the clock come up and take our orders. The cashier/order taker was a very nice lady, with an interesting accent. They turned on the TV when we sat down, and I asked if they could put it on a specific channel. Not knowing if they had the channel or not, she handed me the remote, and said I could pick something to watch. 

Before our food arrived, the cashier said/did something that drew the ire of who we are pretty sure is the Owner, Christopher. Christopher decided that on the line (which butts up against the dining area, with an open-air kitchen) was the perfect place to berate, and belittle this employee. A moment later, another employee came in, and asked the cashier a question. Christopher again was loud enough for us to hear, as he told the inquisitive employee, \"Don't ask her that, don't ask her anything, ever. She doesn't know anything. Ask me if you have a question.\" Or something pretty dang close to that.

My wife's food came out first, a few minutes later mine was delivered, Christopher made light that he forgot to make my food when he started making my wife's lunch. 

Neither of our meals were above average, they were disappointing even. 

Maybe it was a case of the \"just openeds\" - or their recipes are just bland and unappealing to us. 

Not sure if we will give them a try if they make it, until we are in that area, and hungry again."}
{"text":"Excellent!  I had the huge Italian chopped salad and hubby had the rigatoni - both meals were very tasty and filling. Will come back!!"}
{"text":"My husband ordered the sausage and peppers sandwich.When it came out it was very messy.Which was ok tasted pretty good...later that night he was so sick with stomach pains....Something was not right,maybe sausage not cooked enough?We probably won't be back....Saw other people leave with only half eaten pasta dishes.The pasta looked prettty blah...."}
{"text":"Great local place. Super customer service. I ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo and the portion was enough for 2 people. HUGE! A little too much Black Pepper for my taste but maybe it's personal preference. We also ordered a salad and it was amazing. We will be back. Can't wait to try a few more selections."}
{"text":"One of the great things about Yelp is finding new places to eat that I normally wouldn't run across on my own. I was eating nearby Parmezan subs last week when I saw on Yelp they were close by. After seeing pictures of all that melted cheese and fresh sub rolls I knew I had to give them a try. Parmezan subs is located on Eastern just south of Horizon Ridge. 

Monday's lunch special was the medium chicken parm sub which sounded great. I also added a side of onion rings as a side. They have many home made desserts such as cannoli, zeppole, cakes and cheesecakes which I definately will try when I return. 

It did take quite a while for my order, about 20 minutes. Much longer than other sandwich places. The chicken was well cooked with a perfect amount of breading. I would have preferred a little more marinara sauce though as it was a tad dry. The bread was also really hard on the outside. I really enjoyed the flavors of the chicken and sauce but the hard bread was a let down. 

The onion rings were fine, nothing great. The employees were all very friendly and I liked the little \"lounge\" inside the store. Unfortunately with the 20 minute wait and the bread not being soft and fresh it was very average for my first visit. I will return though and give them a second try."}
{"text":"Looking for a casual dining spot for Valentine's dinner with my OG, we ended up at Parmezan Subs. 

It's located in the former Bon Chef location, they have updated the little eatery and even added one of the fancy drink fountains. 

I ordered a medium eggplant parmigiana sub and a bowl of Italian wedding soup. The soup was good. It had nice flavor and the right texture. The sub was just ok. I didn't love the bread and the eggplant was thin and a bit on the dry side for my taste. It was messy with all the sauce dripping out so I'd recommend a knife and fork.

The service was friendly and the shop is large and nicely decorated. They offer delivery in the area as well."}
