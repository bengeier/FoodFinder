{"text":"If you've never had authentic Italian food then you will probably think it's great. However coming from a person who's grandmother in law is from Italy it was just ok. The sauce was just not flavorful and either was the chicken. I got the chicken parmesan and I honestly make it better at home. The breading had no flavor, a little salt goes a long way. The breading simply slid right off when I cut it. I got three small chicken breast, but it was enough. The spaghetti was just a few bites though, so way more chicken than spaghetti. My husband ordered spaghetti and meatballs and he only got two of them and they were medium size. The salad was small but ok. The fried zucchini we had as an appetizer was good, but once again lacked any real flavor. Good thing I love zucchini. The waitress was great but it took awhile for our food. It was packed in there and we were sat in a kind of weird corner. The staff had to keep ducking around this small corner wall cause the tables were close together. The staff could barely move from table to table. And it was a little annoying to get asked by every staff member how was everything like every 5 mins. Good service, but come on you keep interrupting and making it less enjoyable. For the price I have been to a couple other places that were way better with bigger portions."}
{"text":"Went in early on saturday night,  the service was fast, pleasant and really good food. we will be going back to try the sandwiches and pizza.. We used a coupon from deal find, what a good value for us."}
{"text":"The food is ok, but I can get ok Italian food anywhere. What really keeps me from returning is the dismal service. Super slow service, impossible to get refills, and TWICE they have REFUSED to honor coupons that they published, which were well within their expiration date. I wont be back."}
{"text":"Five of us ate dinner at Anzio's within the past week and were not impressed. We all had pasta dishes. The spaghetti that came with each of the dinners left a lot to be desired. It was not fresh at all and had probably sat out for awhile waiting to be warmed up with sauce for each order. Or possibly stuck in the oven to bake with the entrees. Regardless, not the way to serve spaghetti. The sauce was good but not nearly enough of it to make up for the dry spaghetti. The chicken in Chicken Parmesan was consistently over cooked among the three orders at our table. The eggplant in one dish was mushy. We asked for bread with our salads but did not get it until just before the entrees were served. On the plus side, the service was good. Pizza and wings seem to be what Anzio's does best. Pasta dishes not so much."}
{"text":"I'm hesitant to write this review, fearing too many people will discover one of my favorite spots. However, the word has been out since their opening in 1986. Anzio's has fantastic pizza, wings and homemade Italian dishes in Phoenix, all at reasonable prices. Sure, there are other local Italian joints in town, but one reviewer said it best: \"Nobody within miles of this place is nearly as good.\" And I don't live right across the street, this place is even worth driving to."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate at your restaurant tonight and it was delicious!  The eggplant parmesan was just the way my husband likes it. Our waiter-Gami- was  friendly and helpful and took very good care of us. Looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"The food is great. The staff is friendly but very loud - particularly one waitress. You can't hear yourself think over her voice almost no matter where she is in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food! This is our second time that we've been here. We had an issue where some foil accidentally made its way into my wife's pasta. Management was very nice in handling it. They made us a new dish to take home and took it off of our bill. Just how one would expect good management to handle such a situation. I'm giving four stars because our server tonight was not as good as we had the first time. Great food! Great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Another fabulous meal !!!. We found this little family restaurant by accident a couple of years ago, and have since made it a regular stop at least once a month. Staff is always courteous and goes the extra mile."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday. What a great place. My Aunt and Uncle have been coming here for 30+ years. We just moved from California and we had a great back to school lunch with family. Lasagna, pizza, ravioli and fettuccine Alfredo were all amazing"}
{"text":"Been going here for many years...never had any bad food! My family fights over their wings because they are so good! Great family place!"}
{"text":"This place truly is a hole in the wall gem!! We used to live in this neighborhood and, growing up, anzios was my family's favorite eat out restaurant. Now, 20 years later we still go out of our way to eat hear! Pretty much everything on the menu is great. The pizza is a little greasy but is still really good. They use Wisconsin cheese which makes for a great tasting pizza. The atmosphere is very relaxing, not too loud. The service is great. Sometimes it's a long wait on weekend nights but definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Let's start with the atmosphere, from the minute you walk in the place has a comfortable family feel and the decor is amazing. Not just the art on the walls but the flooring, the curtains, the way the rooms are sectioned off.. it's just a great use of the space that they have.   The tables have always been clean and the booths have amble cushion that make your dining experience very pleasant. The bathrooms are down a long hallway that are far enough away from the dining area that you don't need to be concerned about unpleasant smells or sounds interrupting your dinner.   The food. The food is amazing. The salads have always been fresh and the drinks have always been on point. Every entree option that I have ordered from the pizza to the lobster ravioli has been a delight to the eyes and the aroma just makes your mouth water. Then you take a bite. That first bite will make you close your eyes in awe and have you slowing down to savor each fork full.   The service has always been stellar. Every wait staff member that we have had has been prompt, attentive, and friendly. The hostess was there to seat us immediately and the managers were amazing. It is very easy to see how much they care about their restaurant and their customers. Their use of social media like yelp and Groupon to expand their business really shows their intellect in helping their business thrive without having to break out of that mom and pop feel.   My best friend and I went here tonight for dinner and not only was our dining experience amazing but when we stopped to let the manager know how happy we were, he took the time to speak to us about the details of our time there and show us the back banquet hall when we expressed interest for company events.  The hall would be the most perfect place for a small wedding or company conference event.  To say the least this has become one of my favorite places to visit regularly and I hope you stop in to see what it is all about."}
{"text":"We live down the street from the restaurant. It's one of our usual dinner joints. It is a Mom & Pop place, but food it great. I recommend the \"THIN\" crust pizza. We usually have the large antipasto salad with house dressing. It feeds 4 people! The garlic bread is the \"BOMB\". We use the private room, in the back, for all our special occasions, it's perfect!"}
{"text":"Best lasagna ever! Normally never a wait and the food is delicious and melts in your mouth.  Staff are very friendly and attentive. I have been here to many times to count!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, great canolis, waitress was pretty rude and ignored us except to bring the food over. And theres a pokestop here"}
{"text":"Having been going to Anzio's for 25 years now, I can assure you it never disappoints. The best wings in Phoenix and amazing pizza to go with it. This neighborhood join is always friendly and clean and always worth a visit or two when I return to Phoenix for a visit. If you haven't been - you're missing out."}
{"text":"Love this tucked back little place!  The food is outstanding and the service is great!  Any time we have had issues they have taken care of us by offering a free desert, etc.  Our waiter disappeared after taking our order to never be seen again, found out he walked out and quit but they were very professional and apologetic and took care of us. Love that the staff always seems to be the same, so you know you will get great service."}
{"text":"5 starz, if not for, just avg. service on the south side of the restaurant. This is my fave Italian food in town. The veal parm is fantastic. Had a very good single serv pizza on another occasion. Totally recommend."}
{"text":"Food is ok but a bit pricy.last time we were there with another couple the waitress began taking our order she seen we each had a Groupon and told us if we wanted to use them we had to set a separate tables.i told her we are paying on separate checks and the tip would be the same.she left and she said the manager said no.i wanted leave but our friends drove a long way so they set at a table behind us.we have use Groupon at other places and they never care as long as you pay on separate tickcket.dont think we will return"}
{"text":"Pros: It's a small local neighborhood Italian restaurant with good food. Kids friendly nice and cozy environment. Cons: They don't take reservations. We were at the restaurant around 6pm on a Friday and there was a 20 min wait time."}
{"text":"Anzios was recommended by the front desk at the Holiday  Inn, since it was in walking distance I gave it a try. I was not disappointed. I ordered the combination platter. Not only was the food hot and fresh but the customer service was top notch. If I am in town again, I am definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Beyond amazing service every time and again this time with the lovely cathy! Clean and great environment. Delicious food! Our family looks forward to this trip every time and we always bring out out of town guests!! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Another trip to Phoenix wouldn't be complete without a stop at Anzios. Great pizza and wings and always fantastic service. And I love that it is not a chain restaurant - Keep it local!"}
{"text":"The best Italian food in the Valley , bar none!  Anyone who says they were unhappy with the food or service needs their head and taste buds checked."}
{"text":"Food was good. Waitress \"Maggie\" has no common sense. Spoke with owner and got things cleared up. Still won't go back again."}
{"text":"The antipasto is fuckin delicious.   It's sorta overrun with a more mature crowd which typically makes me a tad uncomfortable as a pretty pierced/tattoed, swearing young lady. But the servers are almost always an absolute delight and the food definitely makes up for any weirdness with my fellow eaters. :)"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner while on vacation for spring training. Food was amazing, service was awesome, overall great experience. We shared an antipasto salad, were surprised by a delicious vegetable beef soup that came with dinner, and as entrees we had the cheese ravoli and spaghetti with meatballs. Really good food and service, we will be back when we visit for spring training next year!"}
{"text":"The food here is just ok. I have had the ravioli and was not very impressed. The garlic bread is very good and the meat lovers pizza is very good. Overall a cheap italian dinner but not a regular place for us."}
{"text":"Seriously.?  4/5 stars.  Everything tasted as though from the frozen section of a grocery store.  Soup was canned soup.  Pizza was horrible.  The wings were good though.  Definitely not coming back."}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday afternoon, this is a delightful neighborhood Italian place with friendly service, good if not great food and reasonable prices. I had the vegetable soup (homemade and delicious) along with chicken and brocolli rigatoni with a flavorful alfredo sauce and some of the best crusty garlic bread I've had in a while. Give them a try, you'll add them to your list like I did."}
{"text":"I love Anzios! This is our favorite family spot and we've been coming here for quite some time. The food is absolutely delicious and the staff was excellent! If you haven't been here, I certainly recommend you try it! You won't be disappointed :)"}
{"text":"Their food is GREAT! Actually, I love their gigantic antipasto salad. The small is enough for two.   Their lunch specials are great deals as well."}
{"text":"I'm a little late with this review but we had Anzios cater our wedding last year and they were fantastic! The prices were amazingly reasonable, the food was great, and they even delivered to our venue in way way North Scottsdale. I definitely recommend them!"}
{"text":"Was in town for Dodgers spring training and found this place on Yelp. This place was really good. Fresh salad, awesome zucchini and delicious pizza! Service was good and I will definitely eat here next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Very good food, very good service. Great little gem restaurant! Loved the mozzarella garlic bread and fettuccine Alfredo!"}
{"text":"Went to Anzio's  4/25/14.  By the time I got there I realized that my coupon had expired and I live about 25 miles away.  The girls were great, they honored my expired coupon.  We had a delicious meal again and our service was great.  Anzio's is my favorite Italian restaurant.  We go at least once a month."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, and they never disappoint! Pizza, pasta, sandwiches, and garlic bread are fantastic!"}
{"text":"My fiancé went to anzios on valentine's day.  We had not only good food but the best service ever.  Thanks to Brie, she was friendly,  outgoing and on top of it. Everyone should try the combination dinner and ask for Brie."}
{"text":"We eat Italian a lot. For neighborhood fare this is pretty good.  We have visited about 6 times within past few months. -Chicken Alfredo is delicious! However, for this price, there SHOULD be MORE chicken! We are not gluttons, but seriously, chicken is in short supply on this dish. -Lasagna has good flavor, but again, needs more beef in the sauce. Pasta is cheap and adds no value, without the standard meat in a dish. You sliced this corner a bit thin. -Garlic toast is yummy! -An Italian restaurant without a good Caesar salad dressing is a shame! This dressing is just a vinegar/oil combo...find one without so much vinegar!  Even Paul Neuman's creamy caesar is wonderful! Why not Keep it in your kitchen or find a restaurant supply with something similar? -Cinnamon bread, although too greasy, is DELICIOUS, when taken home and baked a while to get rid of grease and to \"finish the cooking process\" -During holidays we bought 5  large pizzas on different days to lunch with our employees...we were all very pleased!  We ordered meat lovers (sans bacon) and they were excellent! We ordered 1 thin crust veggie, but it was soggy and bland. Pizza is waay above the average."}
{"text":"Hidden gem! Went here for a work lunch once & now this is the only Italian place nearby that I'll go to. Amazing food & great service. Gami has been our server a few times & he's just amazing. So attentive & even on a busy Friday night our drinks are never empty. Love him! I suggest this restaurant to anyone looking for good Italian food."}
{"text":"Good food, okay service. We were seated quickly and the staff was friendly. It being our first time, we asked our waitress about meal recommendations and she was rather unhelpful and awkward. I ended up the spinach ravioli - good, but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Food is good. Pricy but nice. I wouldn't mind going back again anytime. Pizzas are nice as well. Staff is smiling"}
{"text":"Groupon brought us here for the first time. I can only tell you that you have to come here at least once to try out their food. You will not be disappointed! Do not let the outside of the building to fool you."}
{"text":"I am in LOVE with their lasagna!  I love the lasagna so much that I can't say that I've even ventured to try one of the other entrees.  I will say that the house salad leaves a little something to be desired but I don't care since my (favorite dish and it's price) make up for it."}
{"text":"This is the BEST Italian Restaurant in Phoenix without question!  We come here for spagetti and eggplant parmigiana and the like, but also for the great anti pasto salad.  I don't normally order salads at restaurants, but this salad is superb...and huge!  I ordered the small and it is easily big enough for 2 people.  Their ranch dressing is the best I've ever tasted.  I always get a pint to take home with me.   We love this place!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended by the hotel I was staying at so I gave it a try. The food was honest, good, Italian food. Service was great. All the staff was friendly and provided good service. The restaurant has kind of a \"feel at home\" ambience. I ordered the Tuscan Pasta, and it was really good. If I was in Tuscany, I probably would not be able to tell the difference that this was made in Northern Phoenix. The bread was good. There was a lady from Kansas who asked for a spoon of spumoni ice cream. The owner Kevin also gave me a free sample. Great price, Great food and Great service."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE this place. Pizza and wings are epic. I drive 50 miles round trip to go to Anzio's and it is with it every-time"}
{"text":"I must say this place feel like home ,  The food was good and the staff is very nice . The ppl working there look like kids from the breakfast club . Lol they have a bar that is small but there drinks are no joke. I order and rum and coke and it was all rum and a drop of coke . it's a great pre-game spot or if you have a date night with a ugly person there bar will set you right."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS!   This place really offers everything I need on my lunch break. They are centralized, fast, friendly and the food is AMAZING! I tend to order the lunch portion lasagna when I go which is served with a salad and complimentary garlic bread... which happens to be DELICIOUS."}
{"text":"We have been eating at Anzio's for years. When we take friends there they are never disappointed. Not only is their food excellent, service is second to none they will prepare the food any way you want. We love their Chicken and Broccoli especially the white sauce. We also like their veal cutlet which is a very generous potion. We asked for the veal to be made with the white sauce from Chicken and Broccoli with spaghetti noodles. It is now one of our favorite meals at Anzio's and we have many. Thank You for the service and food you provide. You can't get this at a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Our group was from out of town and we searched Yelp to find an Italian/pizza restaurant near our hotel.   The service from beginning was great. We ordered antipasto salad and pizza.  Awesome food. The dining room was clean and the servers were very personable.  Great experience. You can tell there were a lot of local return customers."}
{"text":"Have only lived in the Valley a few months but this is by far the best pizza we've had here.  This is clearly an authentic Italian restaurant. The meal includes garlic bread which is some of the best I've had. It's not fancy, but nice enough. Prices were great and service excellent. We tried their homemade cheesecake which was awesome! Check it out!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza options and they do not skimp on the meat for the meat lovers!!!  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, atmosphere and phenomenal service from Haley!!!!  I highly recommend trying this wonderful place, you will not be disappointed!  The pizza, wings, ziti and salad are amazing!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing awesome food awesome service awesome atmosphere everything was really really good I got a combination platter that had lasagna chicken Parham and fettuccine everything was wonderful my salad was wonderful my wine was wonderful my mom got shrimp scampi she said hers was wonderful The whole experience was just really great!!!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit and we were not disappointed.   We drove 1/2 an hr for dinner here based on recommendations.  The service was attentive and you could tell the sauces were homemade.  It was a wonderful meal and we will be back!"}
{"text":"I have been eating here with my family for years! Never disappointed!!!! Great lasagna and they always have Lambrusco!!!"}
{"text":"Good pizza!  Small place in kind of an off location, but the food was good and our server, Mitzi, was very attentive and kind.  I would come back!"}
{"text":"Awful service. We had a bigger table for a birthday with some kids in the group which could get annoying from a server stand point which they should still handle professionally. Robert who was our server didn't which started off only bringing half of the tables drinks and then took the tables order. The problem with that is half of them were in the restroom. After ordering for everyone including the ones away from the table from the server with an attitude, we asked if we could get the rest of everyone's drinks. After returning with the drinks, one of them which was a water with lemon that he forgot the lemon, we never saw him again until the food came out. Never checked on us, never asked how anything was didn't get the order correct, and had a bad attitude. But he didn't have to worry about the tip since it was include with larger parties. Just wasn't a good experience for a birthday dinner."}
{"text":"Went there tonight for first time and was shocked to hear they had been in Phx for 30 years (I'm a native) .....wow the food was amazing.....best chicken Parmesan ever! Owner/Kevin came over to check on us and man he was a super nice guy! Gave us a welcome desert and let us try his pizza (I told him I had my favorite pizza place near our house) !! Great food.....excellent excellent service and great prices....I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"You can taste the home made recipe in every bite.  Clearly someone knew how to make authentic Italian food. The red sauce is to die for. Pricing is a Steal and the service was great. Wish they had a location in the East Valley."}
{"text":"I had my son's 8th grade graduation party here tonight. The food and service were out standing!! perfect!! I have been talking to Barbara for week with the planning. Didn't know she was the owner. So nice and friendly. Making sure that everything was perfect for my special night. I talked to Kevin in the banquet room, didn't know he was the owner either. Both were so friendly! Everything was just so perfect! I order here a lot for my company during the summer months. Everything is always perfect, food is so delicious. This is my only place of choice for Italian Food. I highly recommend this place for regular dinning and parties! Their customer service and attention to detail is always TOP NOTCH!"}
{"text":"This was our first time at Anzios Italian Restaurant and I loved it! Our waitress was very nice and friendly. The food was great, we had lasagna and the manicotti with grilled chicken on top and it was delicious. A relaxing,cozy place to enjoy and have a talk. Our waitress even gave us a free dessert that said \"welcome!!\" because I said it was our first time there. The prices are pretty similar to Olive Garden's so they're moderate for such good food!! Definately will be going back"}
{"text":"Such a great little hidden gem!  Came here on a groupon and we will definitely be back. Our waitress, Patricia, was awesome!!!  It's always nice when you get a waitress with personality- she was very helpful with recommendations and nailed it. We got the lobster ravioli and shrimp linguini and OMG.  So so SO good!!!  Can't wait for next time - keep up the great work guys!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely excellent. Kevin and Barb are wonderful.  Had my brothers rehearsal dinner here and it went perfectly.  Banquet room is very very nice!"}
{"text":"I was told about this restaurant by a girlfriend of mine. She said how nice and relaxed it was. And that the food and prices were great. Well, me and my husband went here, wow!! The food was absolutely wonderful and our waitresses Shelly was incredible. The best service I have ever had!!!  I would have never guessed this little gem was Phoenix best kept secret. 10 out 10"}
{"text":"Anzio's is a one of a kind, family owned fabulous Italian restaurant.  The servers are friendly and knowledgeable, the atmosphere cozy and their beautiful wall murals remind me of Italy, one of our favorite countries to visit.  The food is incredible.  I had house salad, served on a chilled plate, lasagna-- perfectly seasoning and served piping hot.  My husband licked the plate of his chicken Alfredo.  My favorite part, I have to admit is the hot, crusty, garlic bread served with the meal.  I crave it.  I scarf down too much, but it's addicting."}
{"text":"My wife was craving Italian, so we did a Yelp search and gave this place a try.  Suffice it to say that we were very pleased! It was readily apparent that the food was close to as homemade as you can get and the service was exemplary."}
{"text":"Was around the Metro Center area and looking for some Italian food for dinner. Found this place on yelp. Reminds me of a small family joint. All the standards are covered.   The wings were good, the pasta (broccoli & chicken with alfredo) was tasty. We did not order pizza, but plenty of folks around us did. Looked good. The service was good as well.   I don't know that I would drive out to Metro Center just to eat here, but if I was in the area, it would definitely be on the list."}
{"text":"I order a pizza from here and it was great. Best pizza I have had in Phoenix. I will definitely forgo delivery and drive to pick up a pizza here."}
{"text":"Wow I thought everything came from a can. Mediocre as best. The only reason this place got 2 stars was the for the fries.  They only thing that was decent was the shoe string fries."}
{"text":"Remember that scene in Lady and the Tramp with the spaghetti...don't lie. you remember. Anzios always reminds me of that scene. Small, quaint, the little checkered table cloths. Its adorable.  They have great pizza. there is something special about the crust and thick cheese that they use and the mild yet tasty sauce.   The salads are always perfectly chilled, perfect lettuce. The hotwings are making my mouth water thinking about them.  The service has always been terrific. I have been going for years and have not had one single bad experience. They are prompt and friendly but not clingy to the table. and Its been awhile but 30 cent wing night was always something a little special."}
{"text":"Man decided for Fathers Day he wanted Italian.  We didn't really want Olive Garden as we try to avoid chains but we were in the area so stopped in to OG and the wait was 45 min and we had no desire to wait.  By good luck we ended up here.  All we had to wait for was them to wipe down a booth.   We ordered the cheese sticks for app.  They were definitely homemade and the Kid loved them.  Came with 6 or 7 good sized sticks and marinara sauce to dip.  I ordered the spinach, chicken, Apple, walnut, feta, salad with the red wine dressing on the side.  It was very good and the spinach was fresh.  It also had a good amount of chicken.  I would order it again.  It came with 4 pieces of bread which was more than plenty.  The bread was buttery and garlicky and tasty but I only had 1 piece (It's bikini season:).  The guys got a extra thick crust 13 inch pizza with sausage, meatballs, and extra cheese.  They really liked it and it was plenty big for 2 and we took half home.  The staff was friendly and attentive.  I partially rate staff on if we have to ask for refills and we never had to.  Its a cute, casual restaurant and good size.  Good place to take the family.  We will definitely return.  Total was $44 before tip and that was the app, pizza, salad, and 2 root beers."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. We went for my birthday and the ravioli was amazing! the bread was good, the vegetable beef soup was good. Our waitress was amazing. Normally when a waiter or waitress comes to your table, they ask if everyone's doing okay, ours came asked how we were doing, my husband said we were okay, she made sure to turn to me and ask me as well, something I thought was really professional of her to do. I am absolutely going back!"}
{"text":"Burnt garlic toast. Oh there's supposed to be garlic on that? Decent wings but half of the 1 pound plate was comprised of batter \"nuggets\". And the pie. Uncooked soggy dough crust. Extra napkins provided to soak up the grease on this half baked abomination. Service was abysmal too. Do you think that when 3 of 5 have left the place we might want the check and aren't going to stick around for dessert? Sorry I just cannot recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"My wife and I bought a Groupon as part of a night out.Surprisingly,since we shop at The Brass Armadillo across the street quite often,we had never noticed Anzios.The server was very friendly,and luckily we came in before the dinner rush on Saturday night.We both had Manicotti,which came with soup(I had chicken noodle,good)or salad(which my wife had with homemade ranch,also good).The Manicotti was hot and very good,with a basket of delicious garlic bread.Our Groupon was a $40 gift card,but we were just too stuffed to order anything else.The waitress felt bad,so she brought us a big bowl of ice cream with Welcome scaped on the bowl.What a nice touch.               This could very well become a regular place for my wife and I,with a nice homey family atmosphere.Good stuff."}
{"text":"One of the best Italian restaurants I've been to yet. We've gone for one dine in experience and two take out experiences. Small parking lot but we always make it work. Both take out times, the wait was longer than expected. But worth it. I highly recommend this restaurant. FYI, the chocolate chip calzone is the most amazing dessert I've ever had in my whole life."}
{"text":"I tried Anzio's recently for the first time and was fairly impressed. I ordered the baked rigatoni and I don't know if I can remember having a better dish of rigatoni. It was that good! The caesar salad was average, but all the other food I sampled from the people I was dining with was excellent. I still need to try their pizza though, which I hear is good but can not confirm that firsthand.  One caveat was that the service was pretty bad. The waitress did not seem to care at all and it seems like the type of place that is impossible to get a refill at. I might try ordering a 'to go' order next time, because the food was amazing but the service really needs major improvement from what I saw.   Aside from the service it was mostly a pleasant place to eat at, which was surprisingly because when we arrived it didn't appear to be that way from the outside. In any case I would mostly recommend Anzio's for their great Italian food!"}
{"text":"I don't really understand the hype about this place. If you're hankering Italian cuisine, this is not the place. It  is American-Italian. Don't get me wrong, the food was good. Just didn't have a lot of flavor. Nothing at all tasted homemade. It all tasted like run of the mill restaurant supply food. The waitress and host were very, very friendly. The food was kinda blah. I do not recommend this place for first dates, or even dinner. It's very loud. It's well prepared bar food. Good for lunches maybe. I could be wrong about the not homemade issue, but I doubt it. Stuff just came to quickly. You could tell it was nuked. We did not try the pizza. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Great food. I had the gluten free pizza crust. Very GOOD!!! Our waitress was awesome. We will come back!"}
{"text":"Solid home cooking Italian food.  It reminds me of when I was a kid.  Probably the best Italian restaurant in the Metro Center area."}
{"text":"This is a small hole in the wall that opens up into a lovely restaurant once inside. The decor is very cute, reminiscent of an italian villa. The food was okay, but very underseasoned- my shrimp pasta tasted mainly of butter. The garlic bread was also soaked in butter. Honestly, the best part of the meal was the side salad.  Overall, the decor was great, the service was great, but the food just fell flat for me and my husband, although I am spoiled by authentic italian cooking."}
{"text":"The perfect date night spot! The garlic cheesy bread is to die for! The pizza is delicious also, but I cannot go there without ordering the shrimp scampi. It isn't too rich, it's just right. This place is a diamond in the rough - a MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"I have been here three times and each time it's been better than before.  The sausage/pepperoni pizza is soooo delicious.  The waitress said she has been there more than 20 years, she was very fun and had great service."}
{"text":"Food was awesome!! The outside of the place does no justice for how great it is inside. The waitstaff are super nice. Our waitress was having an off day, and forgot to put our food order in till about 30 minutes later, but she then spent the rest of our time there making it up to us. Will definitely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"This is a great little place. It's not super authentic Italian food, but it's definitely very tasty. The pizza was delicious as was the soup. Staff was very kind too. I recommend!"}
{"text":"Great family owned  & operated Italian resturant. Perfect size dishes with very reasonable prices. Would highly recommend this place if you want a home cooked Italian meal!"}
{"text":"First time here. These guys get it! Wow! What a surprise. Ordered the trio to go. Owner over sees all the food coming out of kitchen (sat at bar waiting and watched) wait staff on point... everything appears homemade and might be some of the best Italian I have in Phoenix ever. On point. Well done guys."}
{"text":"We were craving Italian and found this place. The red sauce was good but the alfredo sauce tasted like it came out of a jar."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place since I was a little girl. You can't beat the lunch specials here!! The only thing they are missing is a patio and happy hour!   Try the lasagna and the manicotti! This lasagna is seriously one of the best I've ever had!!! I don't know what it is about the simple garden salad here but it's amazing!! I also love the antipasti salad!! The garlic parmesan bread that they give out with the meals is mouthwatering and worth going in just for that alone!  The menu is pretty large so you have several options to feed your craving. The portions are great for sharing but also great for one person who's decently hungry.   The building has a small bar that can seat about 7 but the dining area is split in two which is great if you want to have a large party. They have both booths and tables which are both very comfortable. You can always count on seeing off duty officers or local firefighters enjoying a meal here (always makes me feel safe).  The staff here is always friendly and I always have a enjoyable visit."}
{"text":"We've been loyal Anzio's fans for 15 years or so. Food and service are always top-notch and a good value (exceptional with a Groupon, which seem to be published fairly often). Pizzas and Calzones are generous and good; pasta dishes are fresh and the sauces are rich and simmered/reduced, not hurried.  I am a fan of the Parmigiana dishes (Veal, Chicken and Eggplant); my wife loves Alfredo - we've never been disappointed.  Service is consistently efficient and friendly - many servers have been here a long time and seem to like working here."}
{"text":"Authentic Italian food!  Sauces are amazing. We had the chicken Alfredo and shrimp ravioli. Garlic bread was brought out hot. Crusty on the outside and soft on the inside.  I really enjoyed eating here."}
{"text":"First of all, We been coming here for years.... My iPhone has the restaruant wifi password, so much we come here... Yesterday after a long day my wife and I decided to hit up our favorite Italian food restaurant.. When we got there around 3:30 or so, we walked in, the wait staff saw us walk in and sit down (per the sign at the entrance to seat yourself).. It took 18 minutes for one of the wait staff to come and give us a menu... The young man (waiter) and our waitress were bickering about who would take our table... I tried to be formal and decent and not say anything since we have been coming here for many many many years... after we got the menu, another 14 minutes passed by before she came to ask us if we were ready to order... took another 15 minutes for our cold dinner to get brought over to us.... Seems odd that we were served so dismissively and uninterested in our food and experience... the same was felt by the group who sat down next to us, as they looked at us with a frowned look while they waited for their menu as and drinks as well..... I don't like to complain to the waitress, and we always Tip very generously, but she ignored us when we walked in, took forever to bring a menu, drinks and the food..... Sad that after many many many years,  we will not be going back because of how she treated us..."}
{"text":"Have been a loyal customer for 20 years. We order the same things almost every time we go. Start with some of the best wings in town (no joke!), antipasto salad, and one of their unique tasting pies - usually a veggie or deluxe with normal crust.  It's a mom and pop joint all the way, and it's not fancy. It's very reasonable from a price point, which keeps us coming back. I have had other dishes, and they are decent as well. However, the staple here is wings and pizza! Trust me on the wings, they are prepared perfectly which is a lost art."}
{"text":"Small friendly family run restaurant with outstanding food.  I've been regular here now for a couple years and the quality is constantly superior. I usually end up with the pasta trio Fettuccine Alfredo, chicken Parmesan, and lasagna. It's far too much food for one person and  it's even better cold for lunch the next day. If you want some good Italian comfort food this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Drove a long way to get to Anzios because of all the great Yelp reviews.  Was there in time for the luncheon special. It included a salad and a choice of garlic or french bread.  As my entree I chose spaghetti and meatballs (which turned out to be one meatball).  The salad was iceberg lettuce with shredded carrots & mozzarella.  Not a stellar salad but it was included in the special and the garlicky salad dressing made it taste quite good.  French bread was toasted and quite fresh.  The sauce of my spaghetti & meatball (yes 1) was too sweet and had too much oregano for my taste and so I had the meatball and left the pasta almost in its entirety.  My companion had a sandwich of breaded chicken breast and eggplant with marinara sauce which came with the most amazing french fries --homemade french fries just like my grandma used to make.  I thought that was a lost art in restaurants.  Everything is frozen nowadays but clearly not here.  BTW most of their salad dressings are also homemade.  So he totally enjoyed his sandwich and fries until his plate was clean.  The server, Brianna, was wonderful.  She celebrated my first time at Anzios with a complimentary dish of ice cream.  Really, really sweet--Brianna, not the ice-cream!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best pizza dining experience I've had! Came here on a double date with family it was their first time here. Anzios has been my bf and mines hidden gem for some time now. Shelly, our server made this experience by far our favorite! She was attentive, hospitable and welcoming to our family. Shelly helped with their menu selections and anticipated they should select your delicious garlic bread with their main coarse. The hype by far did not disappoint. We are never disappointed with our food items including Pizza and appetizers. The wings were our favorite too. Food is perfect every time. Thanks Shelly and thanks Anzios staff for your warm hospitality."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch during the week. It was a slow time of day and pretty empty. We seated ourselves and were promptly brought menus. Our server was very pleasant and answered our questions about the menu.  We ordered the antipasto salad and sampler plate. Both were delicious! Portion sizes were generous! It's clean inside with a nice size menu.  Will definitely be back to try other dishes!"}
{"text":"Please don't waste your time or money. Ate here twice, years apart and got food poisoning both times. Horrible, just horrible. Save yourself."}
{"text":"Amazing food, seriously. We ordered the thin crust spicy bbq pizza, and it was really really good. Trust me, order it thin crust, it comes out more like regular crust. If you order the regular \"classic\" crust, it's a bit much on the bread side. You wanna taste the toppings, with a hint of crust. I look forward to trying other items on the menu, they all looked great as I watched them being brought to other tables. The service is top notch, too. Great decor, clean as heck, and just all around awesome."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite pizza place! The interior gives off an Italian feel and is actually quite roomy. I usually order the sausage and pepperoni pizza, with a side of their amazingly crunchy and perfectly sauced wings. The pizza is slightly greasier than other pizza places I've been to, but it doesn't detract from the fulfilling taste. I've also noticed that it lacks sauce (which I don't like anyway) and is replaced with a little more cheese (which I LOVE, but who doesn't??)."}
{"text":"First time coming here, I didn't know what to expect, we sat at the bar and decided to split a lasagna. It was very big and we both got full from our half portions, we were served garlic cheese bread and it was sooo yummy! The lasagna tasted very home and had the perfect amounts of cheese and the sauce was sweet tasting. We also got canolis  which were very good and has bits of chocolate chips in it. Our waiter was very friendly and checked up on us regularly And made sure we had everything we needed. This is a family oriented place and I definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Populated with lots and lots of old people = a bad sign. Sure enough, the sauces were very tomatoey and a touch sweet, sort of Chef Boy R Dee-like. There was little hint of garlic, and none of herbs.   In sum, service was a bit slow, the dining rooms were nice and cozy, skip the iceberg salads, but do order the garlic bread."}
{"text":"I don't understand what all the hype is about. My husband and I had the pizza and wings. Pizza was like something you get at a buffet or school cafeteria, nothing to write home about. The wings we ordered as extra crispy which were just that extra crispy, not very flavorful. One nice thing I would like to say is the server was polite and attentive. This was our first and last time coming here."}
{"text":"My husband and I has been dining at Anzio's since it opened (35? 40 years ago?) and it remains as excellent as ever.  It serves marvelous Italian-American dishes in generous portions with friendly, efficient service in a pleasant, relaxed atmosphere. The salads are cold, fresh and delicious, the pasta with accompanying sauces amazing and the garlic bread incredible.  Great for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Giving stars pretty much for our server Shelli. She was the best thing here. The Hostess (kid) must be a family member because she didn't greet at all \"how many\" then started walking and acted like we inconvenienced her for coming in. Grabbed menus and stomped us to our seat like a bratty kid doing chores she didn't want to do. We got our first greeting from our server Shelli. She did her job. The food was ok but not anything we would come back for. Super super saucy. We may try pizza, it seems most people had that. I got the raviolis and Joe got the combo platter. Kinda all tasted the same. :("}
{"text":"Really good food and service. Medium priced menu with lots of choices. I enjoyed my entrée and side dish. Very flavorfuI and reasonable portions. Didn't have to wait long to be served. Nice atmosphere. Restaurant has big screen TVs with the game on."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant with family that was in town! Found the reviews on Yelp to make our decision! We had read how yummy this restaurant was & we were not disappointed! I called ahead to be put on the list and we only waited for 5 minutes on a Friday night. Our server was very attentive & the food came out quickly. We had a mix of pasta, salad & grilled cheese for dinner, as well as toasted raviolis & garlic bread! Definitely a great experience that didn't break the bank. Spent a couple hours eating & visiting, we appreciated that we weren't rushed out even though we were there for a while. Our drinks were never low & we never had to ask for anything.  Finished the meal with a chocolate chip calzone! Sooo sweet & so delicious"}
{"text":"Great restaurant with delicious food, excellent service and a fairly extensive menu! Many entrees to choose from including various pizzas. We visited on a Tuesday night for dinner and received excellent service from our server Shelly. Salad or soup is included in your meal price for most entrees. My wife and I thought the salad was delicious and we loved the homemade dressings- creamy Italian and honey mustard. For my entrée I enjoyed the Manicotti-flavorful, cheesy (fresh ricotta) and served 3 to a plate. My wife enjoyed the Tuscan pasta which is loaded with olive oil, artichokes, chicken, garlic, tomatoes, spinach and feta cheese-awesome!  Try the garlic bread- it won't disappoint! They offer wine and beer but do not have a full bar.  We left the restaurant stuffed and vowed to return again soon."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner tonight and I must say as long time Anzio's fans we were a little disappointed with our dinner. It started off great, our waitress even brought out some watermelon for our boys to eat while we were waiting on the food. The 1st thing they brought out was the pizza, which we ordered thin crust because we like it crunchy. Well, it wasn't at all, it was soft, greasy pizza. Then my boyfriends spaghetti came, the meat sauce was a little sweet & the meatballs had way to much bread filler & no flavor. Some things are better homemade I guess. I ordered some chicken wings which they brought out & gave to the wrong table so I had to wait for them to make more which wasn't that big of a deal because it gave me time to get everyone else situated. The garlic bread was stale & over buttered and it almost tasted like they used old butter. Really upsetting, hopefully just a fluke....."}
{"text":"Great experience. I ordered take out. Girl on the phone was very pleasant and help full. Ordered pizza and wings. Pizza had a crispy crust, great sauce. Tons of pepperoni. The wings were sauced well. Not over sauced. The experience at the take out counter was pleasant."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good overall. The garlic bread was AMAZING. The pasta was better than average. The decor was nice and comfortable. Looking forward to coming back soon."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with a friend this evening, I ordered the veal, he ordered the fettuccine Alfredo with chicken. I enjoyed my veal, and he enjoyed the fettuccine. How ever we ordered mushrooms for an appetizer, they were burned,and they still gave it to us. Very disappointing. Also the salad was watery and the dressing was bland. My garlic bread was dripping with butter and I couldn't eat the second piece. The service was very good, but the sides leave a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"\"Trish\" supposedly a new waiter was probably the worst waiter I've had and I'm not just trying to be harsh, she didn't even give me a menu, when I ordered she didn't get me the soda until the end although asked for it while I wait for my to go order, and it seemed like the soda and meal should've been less than $20 with only some change back but what do I know I didn't get a receipt, other times I've been here I don't mind it and I know the food will be good (usually get the don steak but tried the shrimp scampi along with the chicken noodle soup and garlic bread which was all very good) but I don't even like greeting people and I could wait on people better than her I felt."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how to feel about this place. They were very nice and the restaurant is good in size too. There is plenty of room for a large party. The restrooms are very clean and the staff were all very friendly and attentive. The food in my opinion was just ok. I had the lobster ravioli and I felt the sauce was good and creamy but after a few bites it was just to heavy. The fettuccine Alfredo was good and the shrimp were pretty decent size. It was good it just left a weird aftertaste that I couldn't really get the feel for what it was. My husband had the spaghetti and he compared it to the old spaghetti factory which I am not a fan of so I can't say that it was good, although I didn't try it. They had coke products and accept Amex which is always a plus for me. I'm not sure if I would come back because the food was ok it just didn't leave me wanting more. Maybe next time I will give their wings and pizza a try."}
{"text":"Cleanest restaurant I've ever eaten at. Not a speck of dust anywhere. Not to mention Great food! The meat raviolis are really good so is the lasagna. Yummy meatballs. Lunch specials Mon-Sat untill 4pm. Great for an early dinner."}
{"text":"Oh my god!!! Frickin amazing!!! Great pizza,great garlic bread, and get the combo platter so you can try it all. The waitress went out of her way to help us find chocolate cake and see did . WOW what a great dinner!!!"}
{"text":"Mahalo Trish for the awesome service,  the large Antipasto was a great starter  And the spaghetti with sausage and meatball was excellent   To end the Tiramisu is a must"}
{"text":"You know that off-the-beaten-path gem that you hardly even want to tell anyone about so you can hog all the food for yourself??  Anzio's ain't that place I'm sorry to say. I'm actually very surprised at the number of people with positive remarks about the garlic bread.  Now I ADORE a good piece of garlic bread, do not even go there.  But theirs is the greasy, fake tasting crap like you get in the frozen section at the grocery store!  The salads are basically non-descript piles of white iceberg lettuce with some mozzarella on top.   My buddy had lasagna which the sauce was a bit on the sweet side for my tastes, and I had a personal sausage pizza which I thought the dough had a good flavor.  A bit on the oily side, much more so than necessary. So, although we thought the food was nothing special I will give them props for the reasonable prices and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Went there on a Sunday night and they were not too busy.  We had very good service and were quickly seated.  The food was good (not extraordinary) and I would certainly go back.  I had the combo with veal parmigiana/lasagna/fettuccine but they were happy to substitute spaghetti with meat sauce for the Alfredo based pasta.  I appreciated that.  We did finish off the meal with a cannoli and it was good.  Again, not extraordinary.  If you are looking for good italian this is a good place.  Lot's of 'goods' there, but if in the area give it a try."}
{"text":"Nice family restaurant. We enjoyed the trio dinners that came with lasagna, chicken parm and fettuccine Alfredo. The red sauce was very rich in flavor and the Alfredo was delicious. The dinner came with a perfect size salad and garlic toast. Our waitress was friendly but we did find ourselves flagging other waitress' down for refills and any extras we needed. It seemed as though our waitress was spending most of her time in the kitchen not on the restaurant floor. Aside from that the place was clean and enjoyable."}
{"text":"Fantastic food.  Fresh, bit, delicious.  Trish is an amazing and attentive server.  Thank you so much for being so attentive and kind to my family.  Definitely reccomend."}
{"text":"This review is for the service and management. Great food, disappointing service and management. I was craving toasted ravioli. I brought guests with me to introduce them to my one of my favorite foods in the valley. The server was quick to serve us even though it was a crowded Friday night. We ordered 3 toasted raviolis, one grilled chicken fettuccine Alfredo, and a cinnamon bread sundae.  Clue one that there might have been a problem. \"Would you like soup or salad?\" I responded, \"I thought we'd only have 1 salad.\" Server, \"Oh, you ordered 3 raviolis and 1 fettucine, that is four salads.\" The toasted ravioli's were off the appetizer section, but I thought that they were being generous.  Caesar salads were great. The dressing is homemade. Shaved Parmesan and crunchy crouton garnish was lovely.   After a wait, which on a crowded Friday night was understandable, our meal arrived. Our waitress brought out boiled ravioli and not toasted ravioli. \"This is not what I ordered. We came here for toasted ravioli.\" Our server was not happy. She took it back. Then returned.   \"Well, it's going to be a wait.\"  \"That's fine with us because we love the toasted ravioli and came tonight specifically for that dish.\" My guests told me that she looked really unhappy. We enjoyed our fettucine Alfredo, the sauce is incredible. I didn't care for the grilled chicken. She returned again.  \"Well, do you want your ice cream now?\"  \"Sure.\" We all agreed that we didn't mind eating out of order.  \"The ravioli is going to be a while. The fryers are all tied up.\"  Shortly, the toasted ravioli arrived. \"I guess it was faster that I thought.\"  The cinnamon bread sundae was heavenly. Crunchy chunks of cinnamon with vanilla ice cream sprinkled with cinnamon sugar and caramel topped with whipped cream. The toasted ravioli was heavenly. The meat filled ones were flavorful. The ricotta cheese is rich and fluffy. The baked cheese over the marinara is the bomb!  Sadly, the bill was deflating. \"We had to charge you for the salads.\" To add insult to injury, they charged me 4 salads, one should have come with the fettuccine. When they wanted to stick this to me, they should have said something when they were taking the boiled raviolis. I was too embarrassed by our treatment that I uncharacteristically did not ask for management. This is our second time coming to Anzio's. I love the food which I would give 4 to 5 stars, but I have always left with a poor taste in my mouth as I think about their customer service."}
{"text":"Really good wings yummm so good!! such yummy ranch too. I ordered to go and the pizza was done in 25 mins!! I used a googleoffer and for some reason they made me pay for tax after even though the googleoffer was enough. The place was cute very Italian felt like a mom and pop place :)"}
{"text":"Got to start with the antipasta salad. Small is good for 3 people easy.  Love the portions here. Friendly staff. Pasta is cooked perfectly....not to mentioned drained well. Hate it when you go somewhere and the plate is full of water. Consistently well drained pasta plates with hearty sauces.  Also love the hot sandwiches. Pizza and wings are an old favorite for years and always good for the big groups. Recently had the veal parm, tender with nice flavor but the breading just wasn't there. Soggy as it got to the table....but hey what can you expect when you put sauce on breading. Next time I think I'm going to ask for the cheese to be melted on top and sauce on the side.  It was still darn good.  Been coming here for years and years and years and so have people from the local neighborhood....it's like Cheers....but better."}
{"text":"I love this joint. Amazing pizza. I live in Central Phoenix and my folks up in Sun City... I make sure to stop by to get a pizza to go."}
{"text":"The food was terrific and the service was top notch!  Will definitely be back!  Shelli B our server was the best!!"}
{"text":"Great basic Italian food. I had the rigatoni with meat sauce. Husband had the combo plate (lasagna, chicken Parmesan, fettuccine Alfredo). He loved the Alfredo sauce but said there could have been moreof it. Excellent lasagna. I loved the taste of the chicken in the chicken Parmesan. Thought the meat sauce on the rigatoni had a little too intense tomato flavor. Garlic bread was good but not very garlicky.  Another note-when we were led to our table we had to walk past, trying to avoid, a bunch of food on the carpet. Very unappetizing and was not picked up or vacuumed up while we were there."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza I have found in Phoenix. Perfect thin crust and great quality cheese and sauce. The hot beef sandwich is tops too. They have fair prices and are featured on Groupon. I definitely think this is an Italian food lover hideaway. Very conveniently located off I-17 and Cactus Rd. Great for a nice family dinner or romantic date. Lovely Lambrusco."}
{"text":"This was a delicious dinner! I started with a great house salad (get the house Italian!) and then had the baked rigatoni. The marinara sauce was so good. My mom had the lasagna which I think was the favorite between all of us. My husband had the Don steak sandwich with creamy Italian sauce- it was sooooo delicious. Honestly, everything was great. We had a great server which made the whole experience even better. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Came to the restaurant on a Groupon.  So glad we did.  Took our two grandson, 7 & 3.  Gave us a nice booth and they brought out a couple of toys for the boys to occupy themselves with.  Fabulous way to start the dinner.  Had a lot of other options for the kids to drink besides pop.  Breadsticks were homemade and delicious.  Pizza was wonderful.  Our server was attentive, but not overly.  I have already recommended this place to two other people.  I look forward to going back and trying other items on their menu.  At the end, since we were first timers there, we were presented with a free large dessert that we could all share.  Nice way to welcome guests."}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I found this place after purchasing a Groupon deal. We were a little skeptical at first as a glance from the outside doesn't paint the prettiest picture. Upon entering however, it was a beautiful & quaint place that has a real Italian restaurant feel. The hostess & waitress were SO friendly and had exceptional customer service. The food is very reasonably priced & the amount of food you get for the price is exceptional. To make things even better, everything that we ordered was absolutely phenomenal. The pizza we got reminded us of one of our favorite small town pizza shops back home so it was a nostalgic experience. I would highly recommend this place to family and friends, and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I grew up around the corner from this joint when it was just one side of the restaurant it has become now. Kevin and Barb, the owners are usually present on the busy nights. Local police and firefighters stop in for the pizza and wings. I have always loved their wings, I compare different place's wings to theirs even now 15 years later. I love the pasta, love the pizza and heck even the garlic bread is tasty. Not authentic, but delicious just the same."}
{"text":"This is pretty good Italian place. The ambiance is great and had a good vibe. It definitely had that Italian feel to the place. Lots of pictures in the wall and vibrant colors. There was a good amount of options to choose from. Large array of items on the menu. The prices are comparable to other sit down restaurants and the food portions were pretty good.  There is a lot of parking available, so no issues there.   The service was okay. A couple of times I had to look around to find our waiter. Our food took awhile so we had to ask when it would be done. This is probably the only negative things about the place. Otherwise the food was good.  Definitely a place I would recommend to others. It could have been an off night for the poor service. I would try the place out again in the future."}
{"text":"\"Good Food, But Another BAD Experience\". Ordered the pizza and wing special from Anzio's main menu. Also ordered extra pizza sauce and a sample of their suicide wing sauce with no mention of any extra charges. Got our bill and noticed  the waiter charged us for the extra sauces. Questioned the waiter and manager about the extra charges. They stated, sorry but that's the way it is... In addition, Anzio's would not honor Groupon because it's a \"daily special\", even though it's on Anzio's main menu. Also BEWARE, Anzio's will not honor Groupon on ANY specials from their main menu, includeing the lunch menu that's on the back of their main menu. Just another prime example of BAD WAITER, MANAGEMENT, COMMUNICATION AND BUSINESS SKILLS..."}
{"text":"Glad I stumbled onto this place. I come to Phx once a week and it's hard to find a place to go eat that's good. Lobster ravioli was great. Great service too. Gone back a few times when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Unsure why this restaurant is so well reviewed...The food was extremely bland. We had cheese sticks, Caesar salad, and pizza, and all of it lacked pizzazz. The restaurant was clean and the servers were nice, so two stars is about as high as I can go."}
{"text":"We have been going here for years, This place has some really good food, delicious wings and pizza, Have also tried the alfredo very good."}
{"text":"Great portions good food . Great service. I lived I Glendale AZ for 28 years and the other day was a first time visiting this place. Never knew it was here.   The food was to die for . I will defiantly be back to this place ."}
{"text":"What a wonderful find in Phoenix! First time customer,  but we will be back! Wonderful food that reminds me of family-owned Italian restaurants back East. Excellent Chicken Parm and the Chicken and Broccoli was superb! And kudos on service! Our server, Shelli was fantastic! Attentive and helpful and was quick to offer suggestions when requested. A pleasant experience, we look forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"My favorite Italian restaurant by the quality of food and good services. Prices are also reasonable.."}
{"text":"Great pasta. Overall great food. Have ordered a few things and haven't been let down yet. Staff is friendly but scarce when super busy."}
{"text":"Family wanted to go to dinner for Mothers Day so we had 12 people. We tried to go the Olive Garden but the wait was 2-3 hours at the 78 th and Bell location. They dont take reservations. So we called a couple other Olive Garden location and got the same thing, 2-3 hour wait for a party of our size. Someone suggested Anzios and we called to find out the wait time and to our surprise they said no wait time we get you seated right away. So we headed over and sure enough they didnt blink an eye at our big party and seated us right away. They were very busy too.  The wait staff was super and the food was great. I will be going here again and again. Everyone left satisfied. I hope Olive Garden goes out of business."}
{"text":"Came here tonight hoping to have the great food that I remembered from years ago. My parents used to take me here and it was delicious. What happened?  I got the combination dinner of lasagna, fettuccine alfredo, and chicken parmesean. They pass this platter off for 14.95. The chicken tastes like it is frozen... I couldn't take more than  two bites of it. The tomato sauce is overly sweet and basically flavorless. The fettuccine alfredo.. The sauce was bland... thin enough to not be clinging to the noodles... The lasagna.... The only thing that had any flavor was the ricotta...   Now for the service.  Bad. The server that wasn't even ours basically threw the menu on the table without looking, hitting my fiance in the arm with it then came back with a second menu and plopped that carelessly down next to me.  We're both pretty indecisive,  so it did take us a bit to order. The server was very ingenuine, and it was obvious. Having been in the food service industry for almost 10 years, I know when someone just wishes you weren't there because they want to go home. After our salads were brought out then taken away in haste by the other server, we were brought our meals.... without the server noticing we needed silverware, which we couldn't find our server for. .. we ended up taking some off of another table. (The salad came with a fork on the plate) Our server asked once if we were okay and hurried away quickly almost as soon as she asked. Came back once more where my fiance was finally able to ask for parmesean. The server left our table to hopefully grab it,  but instead went immediately to another table to help them, grabbed take out boxes, went to help another table,  then finally grabbed the parmesean.  I get it. We're not a large party. We don't look like we have a lot of money... buy I tip darn well when I get good service.  Needless to say... I will not be returning... ever."}
{"text":"My wife and I had our first date here almost eight years ago and ever since I try to eat here as much as possible.    While everything here is really good, I come for the pizza and wings.  The pizza is awesome and the wings are some of the best in town.  Be sure to get a basket of their garlic bread, which is with out a doubt the best I've ever had anywhere, ever.    Everything is reasonably priced and the staff is very friendly.    Definitely worth checking out if you enjoy good food."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went for dinner on a recent trip to Phx and we had so much fun. Great food, sweet wait staff, very mom & pop and authentic feel to the restaurant. We ordered ravioli and a sample platter. Everything was fantastic. I'm usually ambivalent to restaurant Italian food but this was so good, I would be a regular if I lived there. I got the cannoli and it was hands down the best I've had since my Italian godmother passed away. The bread pudding was awesome too. Highly recommended restaurant."}
{"text":"Building looks questionable on the outside, but is beautiful inside. Typical Italian menu. Great Customer service. The chicken in my chicken and broccoli pasta was not to my taste at all. My friend ordered the meat and vegetable ravioli, which was a lot better than the chicken dish. Because I wasn't happy with my dish, they brought out free cheesecake and a mini canoli, which made our day."}
{"text":"I have to start out by saying I was raised in a 3rd generation  Italian household and that some in my extended family spoke only Italian. Further, I, myself, can cook very good Italian food based on my exposure to my family.  My wife and I went to Anzios  mainly because we've driven past it a number of times, we had a credit with Groupon and wanted eat out.  Eggplant Parmigiana - Eggplant was cut to thick and slightly undercooked. The pasta was cooked well but the sauce lacked any direction.  Side salad - basically a small potion of lettuces and shaved carrots on a plate.  Meatball Hero - Sauce was bland. Meatballs were small, tasted like meat and bread crumbs, were heavy and lacked any real flavor. While the sauce on the meatball hero was different than the eggplant parmigiana it too was bland and lacked direction.  Because of my history with Italian food I deliberately avoid \"Italian\" restaurants and if I do go to one I set my expectations pretty low. While the food was fair I don't think I will be going back to Anzios."}
{"text":"Food is amazing and their customer service was outstanding!!! Everything from their pasta to their wings is absolutely delicious. Wish I could eat here everyday"}
{"text":"Me and my family came here, service has never been great and hostess barely even acknowledge you when you come in.  Was told when we came in 35-40 min wait.  I have waited with my party here for a hour and 15 and someone who is not the hostess comes and says they do not put tables together after waiting this long. I'm sorry but this is a complete lie!  We have eaten here before and tables were put together on more than one occasion.  Problem is they seat people who parties haven't even arrived yet!   This is the worst service I have received.  And still waiting as I write this review, I was just offered to sit at bar with my family who children are included ."}
{"text":"The minestrone soup was well seasoned. And had good flavor. We had lunch here and they had a special lunch menu that had good sized portions. The food was good but did not stand out to me to make me visit again.  Nice atmosphere and not crowded at all for a table of 8 for lunch during the week."}
{"text":"I am here several times a week. I am obsessed with their food & desserts. The pizza is amazing and their fettuccine Alfredo & parmesan chicken is to die for. Recently they started serving Cocktails's, and I was afraid to order a martini since I am very picky with my drinks. I was pleasantly surprised when I order a kettle one lemon drop martini & it was made perfectly. The staff could be friendlier since I am their often, maybe they are tired of seen my face & my two kiddos. over all I keep going back because of the food. After a long day in the office is nice to go around the corner  from my house & have a delicious dinner & cocktail."}
{"text":"Excellent dinner here tonight! Soup, pasta and garlic bread - all were delicious! The canoli for dessert was a great finisher. Service was good as well."}
{"text":"This really is a great Italian Resturant. The food is great with a superb presentation. The decor takes you black to old Italy.  I knocked it 1 star for two reasons. I want to hear Italian music and not top 40. The music just didn't fit the ambiance of the place. In fact it ruined it for me. The second reason is the slow service. We stood at the hostess station for several minutes before a waitress came and seated us.  That's a big issue. There should ALWAYS be somebody at that station to assist the customers. Other than that it is really well worth your time."}
{"text":"Went here with a group from our league had the cheese pizza with olives recommend this place good service good food"}
{"text":"After seeing Anzios come up under Italian food, my wife and I decided to go.  I didn't know what to expect.  From outside it could be anything but inside it was quite nice, well decorated, and fairly quiet.  So atmosphere was impressive.  Next thing was the friendliness of staff.  I asked to see the manager who turned out to be the owner and told him that something wasn't working right on internet since I couldn't see the menu.  He was unaware of the problem and said he would fix it.  Next came the food.  Wife had a pizza which she glowed over.  I had a combination plate of different kinds of dishes.  Was wonderful.  A lot of food. I'm glad I took a chance on Anzio's.  We'll probably return this evening."}
{"text":"Well, that was delicious. The Don, I think it was, with chicken, marinara and no green peppers. Sheesh! I just ate it 6 hours ago and I want another right now."}
{"text":"By far my favorite Italian place in town.  Everything I've tried, I've liked.  It's a small family owned business, which makes for a nice environment with good service.  Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Best pizza and wings in Arizona. I moved here from Chicago and could not find a pizza restaurant that even compared to Chicago. Till today, MY BOYS AGREE!!"}
{"text":"Such an authentic and delicious Italian restaurant. Great service, homemade pasta and sauce and a variety of menu items. I got the lobster ravioli and my hubby had the combo with chicken parm, fettuccine and lasagna. Extremely homey and very Italian"}
{"text":"Don't let the lack of curb appeal fool you.   Very welcoming inside and the food was delicious.  A little far from home, but well worth the drive.  We will be going back!!"}
{"text":"One word to describe this place: bland. The food can be equated to microwave ready food from the freezer section of your local fries. The service was friendly and the decor is cute, but the food just does not measure up. I was genuinely disappointed after reading all the great reviews."}
{"text":"First time here and it was awesome. Shelly our Waitress was awesome she kept checking on us and making sure were ok. Awesome service Kailey the owners daughter is exceptional !! She is super mature and very humble and was checking on us also and we even saw her cleaning tables and helping out. Great restaurant- very authentic Italian food"}
{"text":"Really? Really, Schott? As Good As It Gets?  Yup!  That's Anzio's. Now to start the story, I belong to a fine dining club, and we go to a new place on the first Friday of each month. My Fiancé and I find its a great date night to go and dine with our friends.   Well, with that said, our host Nick, arranged for the Club to meet at Anzio's this last Friday.  Lucky for us, Anzio's has a private room hidden in the back, that could easily hold 40 hungry folks. (Although we were only 20, we ate like we were 40). First, let's talk about the ambiance, Yes its charming, cozy and has all the little Italian accessories you would expect and more. The service was terrific and the food better. When it came time to order, we couldn't decide, so we ordered the combination with Pasta Alfredo, Lasagna, and Chicken-Parm. Not good...BUT GREAT. The Alfredo sauce was light and tasty. The lasagna, and its hard to say this, Yes, True, as good as Mom's... hope she doesn't read this review. The chicken-parm... awesome.   Now, without my dining club, I would never have stumbled across Anzio's. Its in a strip center. Nothing really special about the area, so it needs to be a destination. Again, fortunately, it has a private room, because the waiting line was all the way into the parking lot, which was also full, but don't let that discourage you, plenty of parking all around, and they work at getting you seated fast.   Now how good was it really? Well, we told Mom and Dad all about it, and they went today (which is Monday, just 3 days after we went.) It's important to note that Mom and Dad are from Chicago, so they are \"dialed in\" to great Italian. The question on your mind is this, What did they think?... Final Answer: They loved it, and Dad said, as good as it gets.   Give yourself a treat, and go to Anzio's. Lunches are a deal at about $8 average, and dinner entrees start about $11. ..and worth every penny. See you there, 'cause we are goin' back again soon!"}
{"text":"First time trying Anzio's Italian Restaurant w/ a friend.  Overall, the experience was pleasant.  I had the ravioli lunch special and tried the meat and florentine ones which were both good.  Comes w/ soup or salad and garlic or French bread (the bread was the best part of the meal and I'm not even a bread guy!).  My friend tried the chicken and broccoli and it fell a little under expectations.  The garlic bread was amazing which had that hard-to-find crunchy and chewy combo!  We also tried the cherry cheesecake which was phenomenal.  Great way to end the meal!  Very nice casual to nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"If you drove past it, you would never think it'd be good but the pizza is the best in town. My husband and I drive 20 minutes just to go and eat there. Now I haven't eaten anything else there so can't judge the rest of the food except the pizza. Also the staff is super friendly and nice."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was the only thing that only stood out about this place, but do not order the baked rigatoni. They skimp you bad for the price they charge. Finished my whole plate a good 10 min before everyone else and they got their food before me! Big plate small serving.. estimate: 15-20 noodles"}
{"text":"The lasagna was delicious, the pizza was also delicious. Service was great and the food was served fast even with a lot of people there.  . I would recommend this place absolutely.  And I will be back when I come to this town again.  Thank you"}
{"text":"Groupons took me here :)! Now I'm not sure how relevant my review would be when it come to Italian food since i only have Olive Garden Italian food so far lol... but I love the atmosphere and the friendly services they provided. Of course, we can leave out the good Groupon deal xD  Came 2 times so far... appetizers, soup, and salad were only okay imo. However, the combination plate has tons of food! And they were all good! I hate chicken breast guys, i would always prefer the fatty thigh  better but the chicken parmigiana was moist! I like the fettuccini Alfredo enough to order the shrimp alfredo alone for my second visit... it was a great generous amount of shrimps :)   For dessert I love their tiramisu!!! The cannoli is a bit too sweet for my taste but I know it s my problem for not liking sweet dessert :p"}
{"text":"OMG, the sauce is so good! I  requested the vodka sauce on my shrimp scampi and ate myself into a coma. My boyfriend ordered the trio, the red sauce is the best ever. The service was great and the owner greeted us like we were long lost friends. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"What a fabulous place!  My husband and I had the Shrimp Skewers!  My compliments to the Chef.  So incredibly delicious!!!  We had not been here in a couple years because we do not live too close,  and we were so happy to see so many people here, and we had great service and a delicious entree.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to anzio's since I was a baby with my parents back when this place used to be half as big as it was and they needed to expand. The food is top notch. I highly recommend any of their normal dish pizzas and the chicken and broccoli. Also, their wings are some of the best I have ever had. I bring all of my friends here for some authentic delicious Italian food. Try it, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Tonight's dinner as usual was great truely a great restaurant McKenzie our server treated my wife like a queen and we love this restaurant we've been here several times the food is great small close family atmosphere and don't forget to go to Groupons and get your groove on they're always there"}
{"text":"Anzio's is THE go-to for casual Italian dining in Phoenix. Every dish is good and tastes homemade. I absolutely love their red sauce (on anything) and especially their lasagna. Best lasagna I have ever had anywhere. Their pizza is also exceptionally good, and I even love the table bread they bring out with your entrees. I've read a couple reviews on here complaining about service. Listen, it's not a 5-star joint, and that's not the clientele they serve. Still I have always found their service to be just as good as the food. If you want great Italian food, family friendly atmosphere, and family-friendly prices, you won't find anyplace better than Anzio's."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here. The food was great!    I eat out a lot and this place separates itself from the rest. The food was very good and the place was very clean.   The owner definitely pays attention to detail. As he walked in he even noticed the fingerprint on the glass door and made sure it was taken care of.  This place has a very clean environment (which I really like) and again the food was awesome!"}
{"text":"When I am too tired to cook and want a treat to eat with my tv watching night this is one on my list.  Anzios is located off I 17 on the way home from work.  I always get ToGo.  The Cashiers are always nice and there does seem to be a Manager or Owners present.   On this ToGo, I ordered one of my regulars:     Tonight's  3 pieces Cod Fish very fresh however batter very tough , the fries, garlic bread and tartar sauce all excellent.  Chicken Soup always tastes like Mix just add water and boil.   The treat of the night were the Cannoli\"s.  I think they made the shells in-house or they are using a high quality shell.  Meal 2.5, Service/To Go Careful Packaging 4.5 +Cannoli 5 = 4 Overall Rating.  If the batter on the fish was tender and the soup was changed they would have an easy 5."}
{"text":"Definitely one of our \"go to\" places. Their food is so authentic with terrific prices and service."}
{"text":"Love this place!  I love that they are always on Groupon too.  The onion rings and some of the best.  My husband loves their wings and the fact that you can split up what flavors you get in groups of 6.  Not alot of places offer that.The pizza is to die for and very filling. We have figured out that we can just get a small, the onion rings and 12 wings and we are stuffed.  While we are creatures of habit and always stick to pizza, my father in law has gotten their BLT and loved it.  We were all surprised how large of a potion the sandwich was and the amount of fries he got as a side. They definetly ddn't skimp on it.  We come at least once a month.  We weren't sure what to expect the first time we went since it looks like it is just a hole in the wall place, but I am finding those are some of the best places."}
{"text":"My only issue was the seating issue, and that was due to the hour.  Tiny lil neighborhood place that is gorgeous inside and soooo goood.  Lobster ravioli, man."}
{"text":"I came with a friend thanks to help suggestion. The place is small but cozy with a very vibrant decor. Is a family own restaurant which makes it a more comfortable place to be. We ordered a Small salad which ended up being a huge salad but it was good for the 2 of us also a minestrone soup very hearty and creamy. Then we ordered the chicken rigatoni with broccoli and this was very creamy and had a hint of zest and not very overpowering with the spice. To end the night I had the delicious and cute Mini Canolo. Our server Taylor was very attentive,  Knowledgeable,  and great smile. Taylor took very good care of US. I will come back again and tell my friends."}
{"text":"Once again my family dined st Anizo's and had out standing service. Tonight we had a new Water who did a very good job he was very out going and friendly. When the food came out it was hot and fresh as always everything was perfect. I have never has a bad experience it's always been topnotch.."}
{"text":"Wow!  I ONLY like Italian if it's Excellent. First time here...and I don't like it, I LOVE IT!!!  Best I've found in Phoenix, thanks for an unbelievable meal. I had the Lobster Ravioli, and garlic cheese bread. The meal also came with the best garlic toast...the only other place I've ever had garlic toast that would compare, was at Mancini's Steakhouse in St. Paul Minnesota.   And...for it being my first time there, they did a complimentary 'Welcome' ice cream.   I highly HIGHLY recommend this little hidden find!"}
{"text":"First time customers.  The restaurant was very quaint.  The service was decent, they were very busy.  The food was good, not fantastic.  We got the combination plate to share which was lasagna, chicken parm and fettuccini Alfredo.  We also got a pizza.  The entree was good the pizza we didn't really care for.  Very thin cracker crust and an over powering amount of oregano. The kids pizza was more of a traditional pizza and was very good.  The comped us an icecream for being first time customers.  Thought that was very nice.  Also want to add that the website prices were not updated with their current menu and prices were different."}
{"text":"I went here the other night on a date. I didn't even know it was there all these years. The service was excellent and the food was great. I am not really into Italian food so I ordered the Fish. Three big pieces with fries, salad and garlic bread. It was way too much food and not really expensive. I was sorry I didn't save room for dessert. The Chocolate Calzone looked amazing.  I will be back again."}
{"text":"We have lived in this area for 25 years and we kept driving past his restaurant so I will try it one day. The restaurant has excellent food and a great atmosphere. We have done carry out to and the quality of food is excellent just like it is at the restaurant"}
{"text":"Family friendly home cooked meals..it taste like Sunday dinner. Staff is awesome! I order the lobster ravioli my first visit, and it was incredible. My second visit I had the old time favorite the trio- except I ditched the lasagna and got eggplant parm, and that was delicious. I have never been disappointed and will be back next week."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden treasure! This was our first time, I can't believe we've never heard of this place. It's tucked in a corner, almost didn't see it. Once we walked in the look and feel was lovely. Great for families or a romantic date. The food was excellent and a nice change from the usual big name Italian places. Loved all the choices on the menu too, I ordered the lasagna and the spicy meatballs. I have to say the meatballs stole my heart, so moist and just enough spiciness. Our waitress was wonderful, she even brought out a beautiful dessert on the house since it was our first time there.We were so surprised, can't wait to go back!  Thank you Anzios!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. It's a hidden gem. My girlfriend said she has been bringing her family here since 2007 and I can see why. Great service and great food."}
{"text":"My family and I love this place! It's our go-to for birthday dinners. I always order the same thing; spaghetti with meat sauce. I love their salad that comes with it and the garlic bread... OMG so delicious! If we have room we always get dessert. I'm not giving it a complete five star only because I feel like their dinner prices have gone up quite a bit in the last few years and the serving size isn't much bigger than the lunch special size... so if I do go I try to make sure it's at lunch time; saves me $5 on my spaghetti. Plus the monkey bread dessert is now more ice cream than monkey bread, which is disappointing.   P.S. They must put crack or something in their strawberry lemonade because it is addicting! So good!   Keep up the good work Anzio's!"}
{"text":"This is the best Italian I have had here in the Phoenix area. The best pasta I have ever had. Yummy. I will definitely be back. It is a cute little restaurant."}
{"text":"So we are in Phoenix for a soccer tournament, need a place to accommodate 50 people for a team dinner on a Friday. We call later that afternoon and Anzio's graciously accommodates us.  Did a great job for us literally dropping in with a ton of people.  Service was great and the Anzio's team was organized.  Took a while to sort out the bills at the end, but that's understandable.  The room was nice and arranged perfectly for us.  Most importantly got us drinks fast, big thing for me. :)  I used to work in a Italian restaurant when I was going to school, so I know thing or two.  The place:  Nicely laid out, clean restrooms.  Cool Italian motif.  The Food:  I asked everyone) Pretty good overall.  They make their own Ranch dressing-a must.  Marinara and meat sauce was good.  The Don sandwich was the Bomb.  Pizza took a while, but it was Friday night.  We will come back again, but we will give them more than a few hours notice next time.  Great job Anzio's!"}
{"text":"I'm from out of state and was in the mood for spaghetti and meatballs. I didn't want to go to a pizza joint nor did I want a fancy place. Anzio's was perfect. The food was great. They have the best garlic bread. And the Banana Nutella Cheesecake is to die for!  Service was attentive without being intrusive. Wish I had an Anzio's near home."}
{"text":"Never had a problem with these folks. Great customer service, good eats and a nice bar that should satisfy the majority of drinkers. Nice for couples. .. GF gets Groupon but we have gone without it. (That's how we found this place) Check it out."}
{"text":"So good! Little shady area but beautiful place and food is amazing! Highly recommend the tiramisu it's obviously made in high you'll not want to share!"}
{"text":"Great food and service last Fri evening. Our waitress could tell we were visiting AZ and brought us a gorgeous ice cream dessert at the end of our meal. She was the sweetest. Wish I could remember her name.  I ordered meatball sandwich special and my husband got pizza. We also shared the antipasti salad. Everything was delicious and freshly prepared. Thx!"}
{"text":"(Writing this as we are here)  After reading rave reviews about Anzio's, my wife and I decided to give it a try. Trying to find the place with GPS was...well...an adventure. Upon arrival, we were warmly greeted and handed a pager. The other \"regulars\" inside waiting were very warm and hospitable. One gentlemen commented on how they come to Anzio's every Friday night for family dinner. I figured that it must be good.  We were seated in a quiet corner next to a large 60\" flat screen with the playoff games on. The atmosphere was pleasant, not too loud, not too quiet. Normal conversations being had at the different tables. The wait staff was well dressed and professional. We waited a little bit more that 5 minutes to be greeted by the server, but, he did make up for it in his attentiveness and speed of service.   The dinner menu was somewhat overwhelming. So many options, so many different food types. Heck, there was even 1 lb. burgers on there?! I thought this was an Italian restaurant? We started out with some wings, sweet and spicy and medium. Texture was good, seems like they went through the pizza oven and then mixed with the sauces. Not bad, but, I'm not sure that it's worth the price.  For entrees, I decided to go with the classic trio (Chicken Parmesan, Fettucine Alfredo, and Lasagna). My wife had the chicken and broccoli dish. Our meals came out with our choice of soup or salad. I tried the chicken noodle soup which was surprisingly VERY good. My wife's salad was a typical house salad but was generous in portion and was the right starter to the meal.   The food came out PIPING hot! We were warned to let it cool for a moment before we dove it. I don't think I let her finish the sentence before my fork was in the Chicken Parm. The Trio was darn good! The Chicken Parm was the best part of the dish. The Lasagna felt that it lacked something in the sauce. The noodles, cheese, and filling were great, it's just that the sauce was bland. The Fettucine was cooked perfectly and the alfredo was very tasty. I would try that again. It was not too heavy, not too garlicy, just right. Not many place can do that!  The Chicken and Broccoli dish was just what my wife (8 months pregnant) was craving. It came with their signature garlic bread which was cooked to perfection. Perfect amount of garlic butter, cheese and crunch to the baguette. She had \"way too many\" (her words).  My 2 year old son devoured his kid's spaghetti. He ended up licking his fingers after shoving the last forkful in and proclaiming aloud \"dee---rishious\" (his best attempt to say delicious). He was quite upset when it was gone and asked for more.  Overall, we were very pleased with our experience. The server was very attentive and the speed of service was perfect. Only complaints would be waiting more than 5 minutes to be greeted at the table and the taste of the sauce on the lasagna. Everything else was great.  We'll be back soon to try a couple of different options. 4.5/5"}
{"text":"Maggie took great care of us and surprised us at the end of our meal with a plate of ice cream decorated with \"Happy Anniversary!\" on it. The food was delicious and even their salad dressings are made in the restaurant. The only downfall was that the red sauce was a little bland and Maggie said that she brought me creamy Italian dressing when it was actually ranch. But it was still delicious and I was very happy with it. Oh, and I didn't like that combination platter I ordered had the alfredo dish sandwhiched between the two red sauce dishes and I did not like that I didn't get to enjoy my alfredo sauce because it had red sauce mixed almost entirely throught. It should come on a separate plate, or at least offered to be plated separately. The atmosphere is awesome and everything is very clean. The garlic bread is delicious. Overall, great find!"}
{"text":"We LOVE this Italian Restaurant! The food is always over the top but sometimes the service can be iffy. We are happy when we get the same server as she takes great care of us and creates an experience. The other servers are ok but don't do anything to make it a special experience. They have the BEST wings in town. We also love their traditional Italian dishes. We are trying their pizza during our next visit. Parking is a little hard since there is only a limited amount of spaces and it's in a dim lighted area so seems a little sketchy but we've never had a problem.   Try their chicken noodle soup. Add salt and pepper and it's great!  Save room for their Cannoli's and ice cream. It's worth the calories!   Support this great local restaurant and you'll be pleasantly surprised!   Full Disclosure: I only gave 4 stars instead of 5 because sometimes the service is average and if they seat me at that weird table that faces the wall, I will never come in again. LOL. Seriously they need to remove that table or use for water pitchers and iced tea.   Highly recommend giving this place a try!"}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favorite finds from yelp!  It's not fancy inside but very cozy. Sometimes seat yourself, sometimes there's a hostess.  I love the pizzas(thin crust), wings, pasta, salads, and garlic bread. I've tried the buffalo chicken pizza, make your own pizza with spinach, mushroom, and chicken,  the pasta with chicken and broccoli, lasagna, chicken parm, fettuccine Alfredo, and the chicken Caesar salad. I have a hard time deciding which to choose each time and there's more I'm dying to try!  If you're on this side of town, make sure you stop in! Ohhhh and the canolis!! Holy canolis!!! I'm no expert by any means, but Anzio's makes the best one I've ever had!!!  Great. Now I want to go get one!  I've posted a few pictures also."}
{"text":"Very good food! Lunch menu was very reasonable!  Salad or soup, entree & garlic bread included! I had baked ziti with meat sauce,it was delicious!"}
{"text":"I like the comparison to Lady & the Tramp that Nathan S. made in his review. This place totally reminds me of that scene too with the red & white checkered table cloths.  The service at Anzio's is usually very good. The salads are very good. The bread is good. The pizza and the other dishes are just ok. The beer selection is lacking, no good micro-brews (get some Sierra Nevada, New Belgium beers or at least some Four Peaks, would ya?)  And that's all I've got to say about that"}
{"text":"Great place my wife and I go to when can't decide what's for dinner. Not only is this a great Italian restaurant. But they have great Non Italian food like spicy chicken sandwiches, hamburgers, great hot subs and fish and chips. Also you have to try the cannoli. Great food great price what else do you need?"}
{"text":"My aunt has been coming to Anzio's for years and years.  I enjoy going with her every now and then. They have good pasta dishes, good pizza, and my husband likes their buffalo chicken sandwich.  Service is sometimes slow but the food is always good.  I like their antipasto salad and chicken and broccoli pasta.  Lunch specials are a good value!  Would definitely recommend eating here."}
{"text":"I'm very loyal to my restaurants and we love this place. We've had the pizza, salads, spaghetti, lasagna, chicken noodle soup, and wings. Al very good. You can never go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"The Sweet Hawaiian had no damn cheese in it no sauce it was so dryyyyyy This was my first pizza from here the main dishes and wings are great but that  expensive ass pizza was terrible"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for a date night about a week ago, and I wanted to leave a quick review letting everyone know how great this little hole in the wall is! Very quaint and cozy atmosphere and very attentive staff - our glasses never went empty! Our waitress was very sweet and helpful (I wish I could leave her name but I've since forgotten). I had the lobster ravioli with garlic bread while my boyfriend ordered their grilled cheese with onion rings. And to finish off, my boyfriend wanted to try their smaller cannoli (he'd never had one before and loved it!) and we ordered the strawberry cheesecake to share. Everything was delicious! I want to come back here again the next time we're craving Italian!"}
{"text":"Really yelpers, you think 4 stars?*&$  They are very nice people but this is pretty bad Italian food.  The pizza was pedestrian at best and the lasagna was just down right bad.  I'm talking a  step above airplane lasagna.  I wish them well here but don't come thinking you are going to have great Italian food."}
{"text":"Not really a review, but definately worth a mention!    Monday night pasta special: Spaghetti dinner with your choice of one topping. Served with either homemade soup or salad and that knee-knocking garlic toast. All for $8.50.  Seriously?!! I have to take over half of it home, so it easily makes two meals and in this economy that is a bargain for some yummy Italian eats!!"}
{"text":"First visit tonight and so glad we came!  Our server was wonderful, attentive and personable. The food was absolutely wonderful  from our salad, bread to the entrée.  Our friend tried the chicken noodle soup and loved it. I ordered the lasagna and it was probably the best I have ever had. They said they make their sauce there from scratch and it makes every dish. The salads come out on a cold plate with a cold fork to make it fresh and their house italian was excellent.  We were going to try a few things off the desert menu and the owner came out and we started talking.  In addition to sweet cannolis and tiramasu, we got to try a new item coming on the menu soon. We will be back for sure!!  One last thing we commented on with the other couple we went with was that while it was busy (most tables occupied), we were able to sit and have a pleasant conversation without the noise usually associated with a busy restaurant.  So 5 stars on the atmosphere too! If you are driving down 17 make the stop, it is worth the trip.  Prices very reasonable and food the best."}
{"text":"My wife and I have not been to Anzio's for many years. I saw a Groupon Coupon a few months ago. This evening we used it. It is not a fancy place. It is crowded. Clearly a favorite Friday night outing for many families. I had the trio combo and my wife had the Tuscan pasta. It was all good. After we lost our favorite Italian restaurant when it was sold last December, we believe we have found our local replacement. Bon Appetite!"}
{"text":"I used to love coming here with family and friends! I would recommend it to everyone. Lately, their staff and customer service is lacking. Multiple times they've messed up my order, they're truly incompetent. There's two great workers, an older Hispanic man and a wonderful middle aged woman who are amazing!  I'm a manager of a retail store, I expect excellent customer service if I'm paying for anything. I'm weary of coming back again."}
{"text":"Well we saw you on check please... And thought we'd give you a try on a Friday night. Fail. Epic fail. Ignores by your staff for over 25 minutes. Moved to bar hoping to get better service, and extremely rude girl working there.we were really looking forward to trying  your restaurant. Spoke to both ownes one followed us I to the parking lot. Highly doubt we give you a tried try. Good luck. Speak to your staff. It's hard to find good local restaurants."}
{"text":"Tried this place on a whim one night with my kids who wanted Italian, they like the big name place that I won't name drop. Lets just put the initials OG. Anyways this was a great choice. Super neat place with a fantastic wait staff. I seriously loved our server, sadly I don't remember her name but we actually hugged before I left. The food was FANTASTIC. I am now an official fan and will return"}
{"text":"Awesome food and service!  Highly recommend to anyone looking for a great local Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"Really great service and food.  We've been coming for years and really enjoy the italian food.  This visit we ordered garlic cheese bread as an appetizer (lots of bread) but we ended up liking the free bread (same thing only no cheese) that came with dinner.  Could've saved $8.  Try this place out -- you'll really enjoy it and leave with a happy, full tummy."}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking for good Italian food , so we googled \"best italian in Phoenix\". Angio's came up.  Then after reading the Yelp reviews we decided we would definitely give it a try.   The atmosphere when we walked in was cozy and casual. We were seated immediately which was another bonus.   Our server was Mike...he was awesome and recommended several menu options for us to try.  We started with the coconut, macadamia shrimp, which came out hot and with two delicious sauces.  We then decided on the Chicken Alfredo Pizza.  Again, another great choice.  The crust was just right and the toppings were very flavorful.  GREAT food added with GREAT service made for a GREAT Birthday dinner for my husband.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for the first time by google searching italian restaurants in phoenix.  The atmosphere was inviting and cozy. The staff was friendly and prompt. I ordered the chicken parmigiana with spaghetti side salad and garlic bread. My boyfriend had the spaghetti with meat sauce and a side salad with garlic bread. Both meals were excellent and the price was very good. Portion size was great too. I will recommend this restaurant to my friends."}
{"text":"I have been eating here since I moved to Phoenix almost a decade ago. This resturant just keeps getting better and better!  They serve real, authentic Italian food, always with a smile!  The lunch menu is very affordable and still offers good portions for the cost. While the dinner menu is more pricey, but offers enough food to spilt with a friend.   When you've been going here as long as I have, you get to know the servers, and they are all so hospitable. Many even remember repeat customers, know their orders, etc. I love the family vibe this restaurants puts off."}
{"text":"Went to lunch on a Sunday with some girlfriends, and they picked Anzios, found out that the place has been in business for 28 years, I love small local places!  And it looks like fellow Phoenicians love it too!     I ordered the fettuccine alfredo and added chicken to it, the creamy alfredo sauce has some great flavor, couldn't get enough of it, even used the garlic bread to mopped it up, oh soo yummy! The noodles cooked perfectly and the chicken tender and tasty! The garlic bread was perfectly toasted & soaked up sauce beautifully!  The side salad was crisp & fresh, a perfect little salad.  Our server Gus made sure that we were taking care of, very friendly and helpful!    I love local places & great service!  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service. We drive from Laveen often for this traditional Italian deliciousness! Come once and you'll be a regular."}
{"text":"We had the ravioli. It was fabulous. Lasagna, veal Parmesan and garlic bread. Yummy. Very accommodating staff."}
{"text":"Really really great food,  great service.  The garlic bread is ridiculously great.  Seems like everything is made from scratch.  Great value to,  not expensive.   A++++++"}
{"text":"I started going there in High school when a girl I dated worked there and have been going back ever since!  I took my current girlfriend of 3 years tehre on our first date and go try to stop in with the same group of buddies at least once a month.  The wings are AMAZING and the Pizza is probably the second best pizza I have ever had!  It is a quite and quint place and the staff is always nice.  it is a MUST if you live anywhere near here!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Anzio's for no less than 10 years now. You can always count on good food, great service, and dinner can be an exceptional value especially when you have a Groupon which are fairly easy to find. Their pizzas are good however I always go with the pasta. My favorites are the Lobster Ravioli, the Manicotti, and the Veal Parmesan. Service is always fast and friendly and I've never encountered a problem. It is definitely one of our favorite down-home Italian restaurants."}
{"text":"All of the food here was amazing! We ate too much because it was worth eating. The dessert, banana Nutella cheesecake was fantastic. Service was great and the price was right. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Just went to lunch there today (10/23/09). When I first walked in I was actually a little disappointed that smoking is banned as it would have added to the atmosphere, which is \"generic local Italian place\" but not too gaudy and the dining room might even be called \"cozy\". Kind of like a Mimi's Cafe but less cluttered.  Had the hoagie with Italian minus onions with the shoestring fries. The ingredients were fresh with a surprisingly good sub roll. I'd drop the American cheese though. My coworkers had \"The Don\" (steak hoagie) and a spaghetti plate. Everything looked good if very simple.  I'll offer an an extra star for a local independent that's seems to making a good go of it. If you're in the area and looking for Italian, you could do worse, but I wouldn't drive more than 30 minutes for this."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Italian restaurant in the valley for chicken parmigiana with spaghetti! It's a mouthgasm. Their garlic bread is my new literal bread and butter; is butter a carb? who knows, who cares- when it taste that good! Service is mediocre to good, don't sit at the bar unless it's your only option... very noisey in that area. The prices are well worth the quality and portions. Id give 5 stars if they had better available seating and consistent servers."}
{"text":"Best little family owned Italian restaurant in the area.  The large Antipasto salad was enough for three adults.  The lunch lasagna is just right size.  The staff is friendly and efficient.  I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Ate here last week for the first time. Took the wife and kids and it's definitely family friendly. The staff was really cool and the menu was interesting. I was scared at first to try their marinara because they are from Ohio, and Ohio people put strange things in there tomato sauce like cumin or cinnamon, crazy huh? But this place did not disappoint and the marinara was great. My wife had lasagna which was very yummy and I had a chicken parmesan hero. The kids had linguini in anice Alfredo, which they love to eat. I was afraid to try the pizza though because they only use provolone they don't even carry mozzarella in the restaurant. The specialty pizzas did look yummy on th. menu so maybe I will give it a try next time. This seems like a nice little neighborhood joint hidden away on 28th Drive."}
{"text":"Great little place that is hidden from the main group of \"restaurants\" in the area. This was my first time here and I had the Tuscan pasta. It was great, perfect amount of olive oil, and pasta was cooked perfectly al dente, nice and firm, unlike the mush you get served most places. Staff was friendly and they don't rush you out of the place.  Restaurant is very clean and well lit, with pretty painted frescoes on the walls.  If you're in the area, do yourself a big favor, skip the Olive Garden and head to Anzio's!"}
{"text":"In to the area to visit family. Found this restaurant under local flavor recommendation. Decent time waiting for seating. Excellent service. Our waitress was very friendly and helpful offering suggestions. The food was DELICIOUS. Despite it being a busy Friday evening, we didn't wait long for our dinner.   The family and I would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"I have been going to Anzios for years and their food is very good.  However, after last night I assure you that my family will not return. We ordered the cheesy garlic bread and a pizza. My 13 year old son was eating the cheesy garlic bread when he bit into something hard. I saw him spit out the bit and he stated he bit something hard. He finally cleaned it off and it was a piece of thick glass. The waitress quickly took it back to the kitchen and another lady came over to make sure my son was not hurt and didn't suffer a broken tooth, which he had not. We had them remove the cheesy garlic bread from the table. They offered to make us a pizza to go, which we declined, then they offered us a free dessert. My son of course took the dessert. We remained calm throughout the entire experience. As we paid the bill and btw they charged us for that cheesy garlic bread, the Chef (?) came to the table and thanked us however he was oblivious  that the piece of glass came from the cheesy garlic bread and said he was told it had come from the pizza. This was not a case of getting the wrong order, this was a piece of glass that my child bit into. Not only could he have broke a tooth, he could have swallowed it which would be a lot worse. And if you have one piece of broken glass in your food, chances are very high that there's more. Very disturbing, the fact that there was so little concern on their part that they paid no attention when we told not one but two waitresses what my son had bit into after handing them the cheesy garlic bread to remove from the table."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town.  Try the vegetarian with pepperoncinis."}
{"text":"Had the chicken parmesan lunch special.  Came with a salad, pasta and garlic bread.  Fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"Recommend the appetizer and dinner platters. They rocked our world. Ps maybe split 1 app and 2 dinner platters... You will still feel like you went to Fogo De Chao."}
{"text":"Always wondered if the food was any good.. Really liked the pizza. Taylor our waitress was very friendly, service was great. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"The food at Anzios is AMAZING! I enjoy the combination dinner! And the garlic bread is soooo tender! The look and feel of the rooms are warm and inviting. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Forget the chains...come here! We have been here many times and I have never had anything I didn't like. They have amazing homemade Italian food. I love their shrimp scampi, trio plate, and OMG their wings! I am really picky about wings but theirs are crispy and smothered in sauce. WIN WIN!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for the best Italian restaurant in Phoenix you need to try Anzio's. We were greeted with a smile and exceptional customer service. Hostess, waitress, and owners all ready to make our experience fabulous! I had the chicken and broccoli alfredo  with a side of meatballs with sauce. Wow! Huge portions! Very delish! My husband got the trio which was chicken parmesian, lasagna, and fettuccine alfredo. He will definitely order this again. And the garlic bread... Yum! Our daughter got the children's fettuccine alfredo and enjoyed her smaller portion so she could have dessert. The cheescake was perfect! Not too rich but just right!  I always say the wait staff is what ultimately makes your food taste even better. This restaurant gets 5 stars from us for delicious Italian cuisine, excellent wait staff and comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"Not a bad place. Small, quiet, good atmosphere. The food is reasonably priced and the pizza is better-than-average.  My wife and I like to go here once in a blue moon because we used to live in the apartments right down the street from it. Plus there is a 2-for-1 coupon in the Entertainment book that makes it a great way to try it out.  Service was pretty good too. Never had to ask for a refill."}
{"text":"Anzios is great, good food, good service, and we never have to wait for a table to open up. All their dishes are pretty good the only one I wouldn't really recommend is the chicken fettuccine... The pasta is good but it's either the sauce or the chicken that gives it this taste that right away reminds me of the chicken noodle soup thru would serve us at school... Other than that it's a great place."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were over the typical chain restaurants and we wanted to try a mom and pop Italian food place. Anzio's was the first to show up on google and after reading all the reviews we couldn't wait to try it. To our surprise everything we read was TRUE... It was absolutely amazing. The dishes are also big enough to split if you don't eat large portions .We split the combination dinner which had Lasagna, Fettuccini Alfred, and Chicken Parmigiana. The desserts were not a disappointment either. We choose the Strawberry Shortcake which was made right there by Sana our waitress which by the way was great. While we were waiting Casey the owners Son came out and took some time to chat with us and give us some history on the restaurant and its food. We can't wait to come back and try their other dishes and dessert. Wish we knew about you guys 30 years earlier ."}
{"text":"We just finished the most fabulous Italian lunch the anti-pasta it was to die for, chicken wings were incredible and the personal pizza was wonderful and our sweet waitress Christine was so pleasant and nice. This is one of the nicest restaurants I've been to in a long time and I will always come back when I'm in the neighborhood. Don't miss it."}
{"text":"Anzio's has been my go-to spot for Italian for many years. Great food. Reasonable prices.  Nobody makes a better pizza.  Everyone that I've introduced to Anzio's pizza is now a fan.  Anzio's lasagna is the only lasagna that is better than mine. I love their salads.  They are simple but are chilled.  Nobody within miles of this place is nearly as good."}
{"text":"Came here with my husband for dinner tonight. It was about 6:30pm on a Friday night and there was about a 10 minute wait before we could be sat. The Host asked if it was our first time dining and we said yes. He said they give free dessert if it's your first time there (we never received free dessert, nor did our server even ask if we wanted dessert). The wine was decent, I had the Chianti, my husband had the merlot. We started with Toasted Cheese Ravioli. The Ravioli were really good, the sauce...not so much. It's very thick and very sweet. Also had sort of a metalic taste, canned maybe?? Oh, it also had a giant slice of barely melted provolone cheese atop the marinara (think deli sliced provolone for sandwiches), this just made it awkward to try and eat the sauce. For our meals I had the baked rigatoni with marinara. Fail on my part as it was the same sauce that was served with the Raviolis. Blech! I ate half and decided it wasn't worth the calories finishing it. My husband had the Eggplant Parm. He said it was bland and not a whole lot of flavor. Our server cleared our plates and dropped the check. Not even a word of dessert was mentioned. We weren't even concerned about getting it free, we couldn't even get it at all. I do believe however, if you're going to mention it, you should follow through! All in all this place did not wow us. For 2 glasses of wine, Toasted Ravioli app, baked rigatoni and eggplant parm our bill was $50 bucks. Not too bad but so not worth it. On a side note I need to mention how distracting it was seeing both a server (stocky male, facial hair, longer hair slicked back) and a female busser (reddish curly hair up in a bun) chewing gum! Gross, spit it out!! There were also quite a few female employees with longer hair, past their shoulders not pulled back in a pony tail. To me this says this place does not care about sanitation and for that alone, I will not return."}
{"text":"Heard about this restaurant in Groupon. Thought we'd give it a try.   Honestly, we fell in love with it. Its extremely tradition, so if you're looking for fancy or updated, this is not the place to go. It's very traditional italian with a mom and pop vibe to it. The wait staff was great!   Warning, if your going to order garlic bread as an appetizer, it's probably going to come out with your main meal. We'd had pasta and pizza here. Very delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Nice local place. My husband eats to go from here at least once a week. Today we went there, together, for lunch. I had a yummy antipasta salad with the BEST house Italian dressing. The oil and vinegar, not the creamy. The salad was huge and we could have split it between the two of us, and that was the small.  Ben had the spaghetti, which was good, too. Server was super friendly and efficient. I am glad we have a close option for homemade food."}
{"text":"They updated the tables and brought on a delicious new Dark Horse Chardonnay !  Great service, food is delicious, and never a long wait.  We love it.  Suggest thin crust pizzas, eggplant parmigiana, wings."}
{"text":"We are just passing through and Anzio's happens to be right down from the hotel. Boy did we luck out!!! We didn't have one thing that wasn't mouth watering. I highly recommend the spaghetti, fettuccine, and wings. The garlic bread and side salad were delicious as well. We are going to try the pizza tomorrow before leaving town. I'm going to crave this place long after I get back home."}
{"text":"Such as this is what makes cannoli holy.    It was Saturday evening the the lot was nearly full and as could be seen from the outside, the restaurant and staff were busy.  On entry I was greeted by a \"Please wait to be seated sign\" and the distinct, wonderful smells of Italian cooking, I was promptly seated in a comfortable booth overlooking the south side of the sizable dining room filled with booths and tables and plenty of people who seemed to be enjoying their meals, whether pizza or pasta or both.    I was starved and eagerly anticipating filling, tasty Italian, and the menu hit all the right notes with a multitude of appealing appetizers, pizza and pasta favorites, and nearly equally appealing sounding sandwiches as well as a dessert menu I couldn't quite keep my eyes off of.  I went for the \"Combination\" dinner of lasagna, pasta alfredo, and chicken parmigiana.  With that came a crisp, fresh house salad, and of course buttered garlic bread.  The platter contained 3 generous but not insanely oversized servings, and it both looked and smelled wonderful.    My first thought about the whole meal had been \"There will be leftovers,\" but alas, there were no survivors.  The alfredo and its pool of white cream sauce was situated between the two red tomato sauced lasagna and the chicken parm, and was excellent: flavorful, rich and creamy without being almost nauseatingly over-rich as it is in many places.  The lasagna was a tomatoey, cheesy delight; the chicken parm moist and satisfying, and the garlic bread perfectly warmed, lightly crisped around the edges but not scorched and burnt.    A very satisfying meal and I was plentifully but not painfully full, and couldn't keep my mind off that dessert menu.  There was a delicious looking brownie sundae, cheesecake, and more, but my eye was on the cannoli.  Once I confirmed they were made in-house, it was a confirmed order.  There was a \"mini\" at only $1.99, but none of that for this caloric splurge, I went with the regular at $2.99 - and was not disappointed.  This wonderful touch of sweetness in this ricotta and chocolate morsel flavored crispy fried pastry might have been even better enjoyed with a good cup of coffee, but given what might have appeared anyone around as my own private speed-eating contest, there was not time for that.  It was a perfect, meal-ending delight, such as what makes for the expression \"holy cannoli\".  Apologies that I can't compliment my server by name, but she was personable without being overly chatty, friendly and efficient, attentive without hovering.  Food was served in reasonable amount of time.  All in all, an impressive meal for under $20. Anzio's is a genuine family-run Italian pleasure.  It was my first and only visit, but it won't be my last: too many temptations left untried on that menu. Good food, good quantity, good service and good price in a clean, pleasant, comfortable sit-down restaurant.  Beer & wine available, as well as banquet room facility seating 35-70."}
{"text":"Wouldn't recommend the pizza, oily, not a lot of toppings, had a couple pieces and dumped the rest, my GF & I both agreed we've had better pizza from several franchise places, we're in our 50 & 60s we've had our share of pizzas, can't speak for the rest of the menu, one and done. Not a great value for 25.00"}
{"text":"This was definitely some pretty good Italian eats! Being Italian myself I find it very hard to find good Italian food out here in Arizona compared to the east coast but I will definitely return here in the future! The service was great and the food did not disappoint."}
{"text":"A friend of mine, suggested that we go here based on her past experience.  We ordered several items while we chatted: Ceasar salad, garlic bread, fried mushroom, zucchini & mozzarella sticks and the combo pizza.  The combo appetizers were a bit over cooked/deep fried for my taste.  Everything else was good.  The service was quick and the waitress was very friendly.  I would have no problems coming back."}
{"text":"Wow! If you want authentic Italian Food from a precious Italian Momma and Papa, this is THE place to go. It's so good there is oftentimes a wait,but weLL worth the wait. OMG best I ever had. My son and I are from California and we haven't found anything that can even come close to this place. I recommend this wonderful restaurant 100% Thank you so much for the best time and food. T is our go to place every time we go to Phoenix Arizona."}
{"text":"This used to be our old neighborhood place, we don't get in very often anymore, but it's still going strong....still the best little restaurant, food is fantastic. Today we tried the tiramisu...it was the best!"}
{"text":"Took my son to Anzio's for Father Day Lunch.  Had a coupon from the Disabled American Vets booklet.  Read it a couple of time to make sure there were no holiday restrictions.  There WERE NOT!  When we ordered, I took the coupon out of my purse and showed it to the waitress.  She said to keep and she would apply it when we were finished. Well, when we were done, she said they can't accept it because it was a holiday.  I told her it didn't exclude holidays and showed it to her.  They would not honor it.  Will NEVER go there or recommend them to anyone.  My money was limited so I was totally disappointed and upset."}
{"text":"Good food and very friendly service. I had the tour plate with lasagna, chicken parmesan and Fettuccini Alfredo and it was delicious. I also had a spicy meatball which was also very good."}
{"text":"I had the baked rigatoni with a meatball. My honey had a combination plate. We thoroughly enjoyed the did and the service was impeccable. I'll return for sure!"}
{"text":"Anzio's is my new fav, great appetizers, the  lobster ravioli was amazing, luv the ambience, the service and its reasonably priced, luv it!"}
{"text":"I have given Anzios quite a few chances because it is close and the food is decent. The service is awful. After sitting in Carolyn's section tonight we will not be back. The tables around us were yelling across to one another laughing at how unbelievable it was. Last time I went there and was served the wrong entree.  If you want to eat there-- take-out."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of Italian but this place has my attention! Awesome food. Had the fettuccine alfredo and the hubby had ravioli with pink sauce (mix of marinara and alfredo). The bread served with it was a garlic and parmesan crusted bread...crunchy and soft at the same time. I loved this meal. Finished with a mini cannoli. Yum! Recommend any time."}
{"text":"We've been eating here for almost 2 decades. That says it all.  This time we both had penne with mushroom sauce and Italian sausage. The mushroom sauce is darker and thicker than the marinara with visible chunks of mushrooms. The sausage was lean and tasty without the over powering fennel flavor of some. Their own blend made in house. Pasta dishes come with the ubiquitous salad, croutons and Provolone cheese along with a basket of french or garlic bread. A carbohydrate orgy worthy of a Tour de France rider."}
{"text":"I wanted to take a moment to tell you about our recent experience at Anzio's.  We were looking for a venue for my niece's upcoming graduation dinner celebration from ASU Business School.  We had Anzio's on our list of restaurants that could provide us with great food, service and a private dining room to accommodate 30 guests.  After searching for days, we met with Barbara at Anzio's and immediately knew we had found the venue.  There were plenty of restaurants to choose from, but none had the personal service and \"go the extra mile\" attitude that Barbara and your team had.  Not only did Barbara have great ideas, but she went above and beyond to accommodate any special requests we had from the linens to the plates to the decor.  Barbara made us feel and treated us like family, and I can't tell you how important that was to us.    All future family events will be at Anzio's because Barbara was the icing on the cake to an already fantastic place.  Thank you for being a business of integrity and great customer service.  Places like Anzio's are hard to find, and when you find it, you want everyone to know!  Thank you for being \"Phoenix's Best\".  It's a title you've truly earned!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Definitely recommend! Strawberry lemonade was delicious as was the combination entree."}
{"text":"Classic place - They have the BEST sweet tea I've ever tasted and amazing mozzerella sticks. Their pizza is tasty and everything is very affordable. They have a banquet room for special occasions. It's a small, family owned business that's close to my home. We love it and we will be back!"}
{"text":"This is my New favorite restaurant for my family and I.  Service is great the food is even better. Catch it early before the weekend. Savory flavors, I even my catch my kiddo's trying to lick there plates. My secret spot for now."}
{"text":"Not much to look at from the outside. However the interior was super cute.  The service was fantastic, wouldn't have changed a thing.   The food was awesome as well. I got the shrimp Alfredo and my fiancé got the Don Sandwich.  Both were great.   Really glad we checked this place out we will be returning!"}
{"text":"The service is pretty hit or miss, but I still love this place! Anything from a plain old dinner salad, to a sandwich, to a home-made feel entre--- amazing! The prices are fair, and the food is great!   It's hard for me to leave with out a dinner salad that comes out on a chilled plate, with grated carrots and cheese on top. Their ranch is the best! The pizza is bananas! So good! I love ordering too much, and then eating it again for lunch the next day. And you HAVE to try the cinnamon dessert. I could most likely just live on that alone for the rest of my life and die a very happy girl."}
{"text":"Anzio's is a casual, family restaurant so, since it was too hot to cook, we felt comfortable heading there in shorts. Have you ever noticed how much better even the simplest things taste when you don't have to prepare them? The house salad consisted of fresh crisp lettuce, carrots and some cheese and croutons on top, served on a chilled plate. It's so nice to start a meal with something basic that was perfectly prepared--no wilted or past their prime greens, and just the right amount. I couldn't resist, I had to try the wonderful bread. In fact I \"tried\" it again and again. I'm not a huge pasta fan but my husband's chicken parmigiana with spaghetti certainly met with his approval. I ordered the baked cod. The portion of fish was large (the size of my hand) seasoned and cooked perfectly. I rarely have anything good to say about restaurant veggies. They are either close to raw and too crunchy or cooked to a consistency more suitable for nursing home patients. The ramekin of broccoli and carrots had just enough \"chew\" but not mushy, so I really enjoyed it. Since chocolate comes from the cocoa BEAN, I can only assume that the chocolate ganache cheesecake counts as both dairy and a vegetable and a great way to end a meal. With that rationale, I all but licked my plate! I enjoy this place. The atmosphere (sometimes noisy) makes you feel like you are at your  Italian grandma's. It's a comfortable place to bring kids (lots of families), no one is rushed and service is attentive. There were a lot of really great looking pizzas being served and that's what we are planning on for our next visit."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Have been here many times over the years- both dine in and take out, and it is always excellent food. Amazing pizza and wings. Their teriyaki sauce is superb. Top notch. Will be a customer for years to come."}
{"text":"Well I have to admit, I probably wouldn't have found this place if it weren't for Groupon.... but isn't that what Groupon is for?  My family came to dinner here awhile back.  It was a Saturday night and the place was full but we didn't have to wait too long.   This truly is a hole in the wall, Mom and pop type of place.  And sometimes, that's a good thing.  The decor is adorable.  Besides the tv's one might feel like they're in Italy.  We started with the toasted ravioli.  It was delicious.  Love the sweet marinara they serve it with.  All our pasta entrees were quite good as well.  Nothing fancy, just really good tasting homemade Italian food.  We were stuffed, but oh so tempted to try the banana Nutella cheesecake. I listened to my gut (literally) and opted not to.  I will for sure have to come back.  Their desert menu looks heavenly!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this restaurant. We are addicted to their cheese bread that comes with the meal. It is perfect and often it is what brings us to this restaurant...just thinking about that bread makes me salivate now as I type this.  Service is pretty good here. The food is not spectacular, but consistent and the bread is amazing. Really good deal for the prices as well. My favorite dish here is the broccolli and chicken pasta dish."}
{"text":"I've driven by this place numerous times and never noticed it. I bought a veterans coupon booklet and decided to go check it out. Based on the reviews it seemed pretty legit. I can say everthing was great. The atmosphere was very Italian. The service, food was amazing, the dessert and i even left my money clip there and they kept it for me in the safe.  Oh and the portions were very generous for the price. If yoy want a great Italian restaurant to eat at, this is your place."}
{"text":"I was back at Anzio's recently with a large party (10+).  There was no problem accommodating us.  Service was quick and very efficient, my iced tea never got below 50% full (or 50% empty for those of you).  The pepperoni pizza and hot wings were again delicious."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing!  Wine was excellent.  Meat filled ravioli!!!  Absolutely the best!  Haven't had since I was visiting my old stomping grounds in St Louis.  And the staff is incredibly friendly and welcoming.  We will be back often!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice, pretty good food. We love to fill up and then walk it off walking around brass armadillo..."}
{"text":"Omg I just realized I got this restaurant confused with a different joint and erroneously gave it their poor review! So so sorry!  I actually did eat at Anzio's with my cousin from Tempe and her two picky eating sons. I had a shrimp scampi pasta which was quite delicious. I enjoyed fresh garlic toast and my daughter had a small pizza and loved their crust. I don't remember what my cousin and her kids ordered but they were quite pleased."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since childhood and have had nothing but great memories of tasty food. Today however was somewhat disappointing. I think it was just the kind of pizza we got, the spicy BBQ. It was pretty much just spice, no BBQ. It was quite greasy and bland. It was just chicken, cheese, and \"BBQ sauce\". It could really use onions for flavor as I've had on other BBQ chicken pizzas.   I still give them 3 stars review because our boneless wings were exceptional and seriously I think just this pizza was bad. Maybe next time I'll try the sausage pizza, I remember that being really good when I was a kid. Stay away from the spicy BBQ pizza! Blek!"}
{"text":"Went here today for lunch with my family am boy was I glad I did.started with the strawberry lemonade which was amazing an the garlic bread was the best I've ever had. Salads were cold an crisp. Entrees were hot an even better, I had the combo dinner an my husband had rigatoni with sausage an mushrooms. What really impressed me besides all the fresh made ingredients like the sausage an lasagna was the  outstanding service. Before we got a chance to leave she brought us a few scoops of ice cream which tasted hand churned an melt in your mouth delicious. All for 46 dollars this is the type of hidden gem that you want to keep under wraps for yourself but just have to share. My family will be back I know for certain couldn't find one thing that I didn't throughly enjoy. I'm sure my leftovers will only last a few hours as I just ate an want more."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here for a 50th wedding anniversary party last night and upon entering the place reminds me of a small family pizzeria.  It's in an older part of town right next to a auto store.  When we walked in, they pointed us to the area where the party was.  It was a long hall-way and opened up into this huge room!  From the front of the restaurant you wouldnt think it was there.  By the way, the place was packed.  Service was great with drinks and  since it was a big party, they had two choices of food: lasagna and chicken alfredo, along with some garlic bread and salad.  The salad was just a basic garden salad, but the ingridents were fresh and it was deliscious!  I opted to have both the chicken alfredo and the lasagna and I wasnt sorry one bit.  It was the most delicious tasting italian food I think I have ever eaten at a restaurant.    My girlfriend lookd over and said to me.. \"I could eat 4 more plates, but Im so stuffed\"  I replied \"I would love to get sick here\"  It was THAT good.  I highly recommend this food and even though we live in Scottsdale, we WILL be back.  Incredible service and food!"}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favorite Italian restaurants. The food was absolutely fabulous, and I was even able to take home some leftovers! Who wouldn't love eating here two days in a row? The service was great! I was seated quickly and the food arrived at the table in no time. Also, their waiters are always super friendly. To make the experience even better, I was able to use my Groupon, which made the price significantly cheaper! If you ever pass by, it is definitely worth the stop."}
{"text":"Best Italian anywhere great service , Wings n Fries are amazing too"}
{"text":"Called in a to go order the other night and was fairly impressed. Ashley took my order and was very friendly. We ordered the combination platter (which includes chicken parm, lasagna and fetticini alfredo) as well as the manacotti entree. Both came with your choice of soup or salad and garlic bread. We selected a Caesar salad and some kind of beef and vegetable soup. We were told it would be ready in 20 minutes.  Hubby went and picked up the food and described the inferior as a mom and pop kind of place. It was still piping hot when he returned home. Plus! The soup was hearty and flavorful, I highly recommend it. The manicotti was decent, a nice blend of ricotta and parmesan rolled into perfectly cooked noodles topped with their delicious marinara. The chicken parm was by far the beater. Very tender and breaded perfectly. Their lasagna was also quite tasty and I was suprised by the generous portion we recieved. The fetticini was tasty, their sauce tasted home made and had a nice flavor to it. The garlic bread was fresh, buttery and delicious. I would recommend ordering extra if you like to sop up your sauce as you eat.   I'll definitely be going back to try their pizza and will update this review when I do!"}
{"text":"No words can describe..  It is the very best in food, service and staff. I have been going there for many many years and I always walk away with my next best dish..   Tonight after a minor seating issue, and we celebrated my son's birthday and the owner brought out two plates (Really a Tonka dump truck and Radio Flyer wagon) filled with cake and ice cream... No words to describe that act at all.. So, you know I'll be back..  Anzio. You guys rock.  Thanks"}
{"text":"Whenever I come back to the Phoenix area for a visit, Anzio's is always my first stop. Friends and family (shout out to Bryan B. !!!) know that if they want to see me within the first 6 hours of a visit, they should just head straight there and a order up a mess of pizza and wings.  The Pizza: I have never ever had a pizza like this. As mentioned before, they put something in the crust to give it a sweet sort of tang that is addictive. The pies are always cooked perfectly, never soggy and never overly greasy. (It's pizza, so there's gonna be *some *grease) And it's so good the next day straight out of the fridge.  The Wings: Again the keyword here is consistency. They are the same every time. Cooked up perfectly, just the right amount of sauce and some of the best ranch for dipping you can find. I wouldn't mind it if they offered something a little spicier than the \"hot\", but that's never kept me from erecting a massive bone sculpture in honor of my tiny vanquished foes. Also delicious the next day either straight from the fridge or reheated. (if you take some home, don't forget a side of ranch, the store bought stuff just doesn't do them justice!)  The Filler: I love the wings and pizza here so much that I've always looked at the rest of the menu as being just filler. But every once in a while I'll sample someone else's goods to see what I'm missing out on. The salads are always simple but tasty, especially with the ranch dressing. They also have a steak sammich called ' The Don' that has officially made it into my Anzio's rotation. It's a steak sammie with peppers and onions and cheese (provolone?). They serve it with your choice of a creamy or marinara sauce. Do yourself a favor and get it creamy and you'll never look back.  I've been coming here as long as I can remember and it's always been good. The service is always good, whether it's with a smile or a scowl.    It's been 5 days since my last visit and I'm already starting to get the shakes and dreaming of my next visit..."}
{"text":"If you are a Foodie---DO NOT EAT here!!  I admit I am a food snob so it is hard to please me but my husband and brother are like kitchen sinks...they don't care, just feed me and they're happy.  They didn't even like it.  (And, NO---it's NOT because they are used to my cooking). These two will admit things aren't as good as ours but they still like it....not at Anzios.  My husband had the chicken parmigiana...meh.  My brother had the ravioli and it was smothered in too much sauce.  My mother and I shared the antipasto salad....um no thanks.  And dessert? Ha...tasted old and was not eaten.  Top it off the service was terrible.  Happy Fathers Day hunny---so sorry it wasn't good :-("}
{"text":"I was looking for great lasagna. A friend talked about his restaurant. The temp was perfect. The sauce was tasty but the noodles were softer than I would have liked. I could tell the dish had been created hours before I ordered it. Oh and the garlic bread was a perfect complement. I can't wait to try another dish."}
{"text":"I LOVE this Italian Restaurant!!!!  They use to do mystery dinner show long time ago. I really missed it!  Both pizza & spaghetti is delicious.  Wish the prices was a little bit cheaper."}
{"text":"Worst food I ever had .... Sauce taste like Prego checking was old and we had to send it back chicken wings were way to greasy and sauce is not tasty.. Would never go back I can't believe this place had 4 stars.."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today, was great! Food was tasty and just perfect size for lunch. I was hesitant to get spaghetti, since I am not a big sketti eater, but it was very good and so were the meatballs and the sausage. And the garlic bread. Nick, our server, was also wonderful."}
{"text":"I took a lady friend out for an italian meal the other night, this place was new to us.  Figured we would give it a shot, and we were very happy that we did.  The food was full of flavor, the staff very friendly, and the menu was full of traditional italian favorites.  I will come back to Anzio's again and bring more people with me"}
{"text":"We came across this place while antique shopping. Great food and atmosphere. Service was a little slow."}
{"text":"Just have to take my words for this and go with it...with where the locals go. Great food, ambiance, with good local offerings. It's not fancy, but value to the community...and homemade Italian meals - Yummy for the not so pricey! Definitely recommend for the the foodies."}
{"text":"Yum! I love the garlic bread and the pasta dishes. I haven't found many good Italian places in Phoenix - this one is great!"}
{"text":"We went out to Anzios for a night to celebrate. The food was excellent and well priced we enjoyed a nice glass of red wine with our meal. I had the veal parm and my wife had the sampler. The spicy meatballs were also very tasty. Our server was personable and we had a cannoli and tiramisu for desert both were excellent. We will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Anzio's is some of the best Italian food in the valley.  Their antipasto salad is incredible!  Their pizza is great, and their steak sandwiches are incredible.  Overall this is a great place with great food."}
{"text":"Everything was so wonderful. Fast and affordable way better then Olive Garden this will be our new place(:"}
{"text":"Dropped by here with a co-worker for lunch today.  She had been several times before and was dying to take me.  She had the wings which she said are \"always crispy and delicious.\"  I don't eat wings - but I will take her word for it!  I had a grilled cheese on rye with fries (yes, at an Italian restaurant) and it was GREAT.  Crispy, wonderful warm fries and a grilled cheese toasted to perfection.  Great lunch prices and the big lunch rush to match and indicate that the food IS tasty.  Can't wait to go back and have some \"real\" Italian."}
{"text":"This is a reality check review.   Anzios is a decent enough place with decent enough food but these 4/5 star reviews must be paid for.   I consider this place more of an Italian diner with a large enough menu to satisfy most. Emphasis on Italian food but not exclusively Italian... (see cheesy fries with bacon or burgers)   Ample parking  Service isn't bad but it's just mediocre like everything else.   They have a very sweet red sauce. If you want a dense home made style red sauce this isn't it. Maybe they make it but it tasted canned.   Sent the lasagne back because it tasted like desert pasta   Veal parm was pounded piece of something over breaded and under seasoned. Breaded shoe leather.. No creativity.   Friend ordered small pizza.. Ate 1 slice..waiter didn't say anything at all even when he didn't want to pack up the extra to take home. A little better customer service goes a long way  Dining area was nice and not loud or over crowded   This is likely a very good daytime lunch neighborhood place. However for 4 at dinner, we went here based on yelp reviews, it was weak. There is really nothing special here.   Best reaction: meh"}
{"text":"Amazing customer service & food! Way better than olive garden! Plus they have a Groupon voucher!"}
{"text":"Took my parents for our first time . My dad and I ordered their combo plate which had lasagna , fettuccini Alfredo and chicken Parmesan . I enjoyed sampling all three. Definitely took home leftovers. Their medium chicken wings were super tasty and nicely crispy.   Their ice tea was so delicious. I think I got full on tea ;)..  Look forward to going again and trying something different"}
{"text":"So good! Pasta & Wine, no complaints! Our table had the chicken Alfredo, lobster pasta, spaghetti and meatballs, combo dish and Mac and cheese... And everyone polished off their dish! Great service and fun atmosphere. Would have just passed this by if not for Yelp and glad we gave it a shot!"}
{"text":"The pizza might be good, but the pasta and sauce is terrible. It's basically mid-west EYEtalian style. Only seasoning used, is sugar. Staff is ok, but the environment is straight out of the 70s."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and you can't beat the ambience. Our waitress was friendly and very efficient.  We just arrived to town and our hotel recommended this restaurant. We were starved when we arrived but left very satisfied. We definitely are coming back."}
{"text":"Went with a friend for lunch on Sunday and it was alright. The place was decorated in a cute way and the wait staff was attentive. The fried zucchini was good. My friend liked her spaghetti with meat sauce and I enjoyed my ravioli. Skip the grainy garlic bread but substitute the tasty French bread instead! Spumoni was good. Basically a step below Olive Garden in both quality and price. Not bad but not great either. Decent."}
{"text":"We had our first me we did not care for had the fettuccine noodles they were very band no taste the ravioli we had were great first item we did not like"}
{"text":"This restaurant looks a little deceiving from the front because it sits in a shopping center, but once you walk in it is very nice! The waitresses were prompt and friendly. It was a convenient place that came highly recommended by the Holiday Inn staff down the street. Me and the hubby had  the personal pizzas which was more than filling and the crust was buttery. It takes about 25 min to make them but it states that on the menu and were worth the wait. We got the chicken parm and meatball parm to go and they were very delicious as well. Also great strawberry cheesecake . Great place with great prices."}
{"text":"Walked in and loved it right away, because of the decor. We were seated right away, even without reservations on Friday night!  The food was above average and the service was 5 star. Our server was Shelley, and when she learned we were first timers,  she was very helpful,  answering questions and offering info. We tried the Combination Appetizer and loved it. Zucchini, Mushrooms,  Onion rings and Cheese sticks.  Yummy! Our entrees came piping hot, served with hot garlic bread,  crusty and good. I enjoyed the Ravioli and Hubby loved the Chicken Parmesan.  Our server,  Shelley,  surprised us at the end with a wonderful Ice cream plate with Welcome written on it. We will surely recommend this place to our friends and will return again."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for spaghetti Awesome meat sauce & the garlic bread is amazing. So much that I have lunch for tomorrow. We were seated in what appeared to be a banquet room which was much quieter than the main dining room. Our server was great. Unfortunately I was too full for dessert this time and didn't think to bring home a small order of the cinnamon bread (highly recommend it). Oh well, next time."}
{"text":"I've had better pizza, much better. The salad was great, but the marinara that came with the cheese sticks had a weird flavor. The waitress was very friendly but the service was slow. It looked like she had way too many tables to take care of. The kitchen also was slow. Took way too long to get our food. I doubt very much that I will be back."}
{"text":"First time was Saturday eve close to 5:00.  I had a craving for Italian in neighborhood.  We try to stay away from chains so this seemed like interesting choice.  Stares from huge staff.  Table for 3.  We wee sat in booth against window.  Surprised by cute (now new or elegant but clean) decor.  Our menus were laminated and easy to read.  The lamented children's menu was torn at edge but also easy to read.    Drinks were Sprite, water and milk.  No appetizer for us as most options were fried.  Husband was not in mood for Italian so his meal was fish and fries.  My child - pizza.  Manicotti for me.  The description of house blended ricotta and provolone sounded interesting.  Came with soup or salad.  I opted for house salad.  Chicken noodle - ick.  Now, I would have upgraded for a Caesar but I asked if they made own croutons or dressing and that was an obvious negative.  Decided in blue cheese as our server said they did make own blue.  That salad came out FAST!  It's $4 in its own and sadly it seemed just bagged lettuce with carrot shreds & 3-4 box crotons.  There were a few long shreds of cheese (nice touch) but it was waxy and flavorless - provolone?  The dressing really lacked blue cheese flavor.  Just low grade mayo with a few lumps.  I expected more.  Cherry tomatoes and cucumber, perhaps?    Waited a bit  longer than what we'd expected but that is fine esp if they are creating all dishes made to order.  The place began filling up.  People were waiting outside!    My pasta and daddy's fish came out first.  My child had to wait for his pizza.  I have never had that happen.  The child is always served first. My plate was HOT out of oven.  Pizza was hot too!  Good thing.  Both of our meals were just good.  Good as in everything about my plate was fine.  Cheese as expected.  Pasta was a wee thick.  I love it when it is paper thin.  Red sauce may have been reduced canned.  I would have loved a garnish of fresh green parsley and maybe lemon wedge.  It was seasoned well.  Pizza was a good size for a child.  Housemate dough?  Smelled nice and yeasty.  $12 for the three rolls of manicotti.  Around $30 all said and done.  Nice staff.  They DO become busy.  Local folks must LOVE it here.  It was mush better than what I remember about Olive Garden.  There is some personality here.  We may come in again if we really crave (not cheap but not expensive) Italian close by."}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall Italian restaurant that is off the beaten path in Phoenix. Nice decorations and a small establishment with a family feel. We only had to wait 5-10 minutes for a seat and the waitress was extremely friendly. Service was fast and food was hot. Would definitely recommend trying this place out! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Come in and stop in a great local restaurant been around over 30 years. Owners and staff and food are great.Come in & be served by Great Hannah & others.Their Antipasta is Awful, they put carrots, they shred cheeses instead of slices, there is no Genia Salami, no Capicola, do not order this."}
{"text":"Short wait coming in, sat quickly. Pretty busy place. Overall a friendly family environment.  Super yummy strawberry lemonade & delicious wings!  Not to mention that their cheesy garlic bread is absolutely delicious  (Mmm!)  Decent prices for good food!   Attentive to our two little ones (under 3) , always had our drinks filled & very good service. You can tell the servers work/communicate well."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I both had the trio with lasagna, alfredo and chicken parmasean. Everything was flavorful and tasted homemade. Honestly the garlic bread was my favorite. I took a star away becuase I felt the sauce was missing something."}
{"text":"We've driven by this place probably a hundred times and never paid much attention. Don't let the exterior fool you, it's a cute little restaurant. We were promptly seated and greeted by our waitress. Ordering was smooth (even with a special food request). The plates made it to the table in good time. The food was plentiful and very yummy. I wish we hadn't had blinders on for so long."}
{"text":"Not bad, not bad at all.  Can't really say anything spectacular about this place, can't really say anything horrifying about it either...    I came here for lunch with my coworkers and we had a blast.  We would of had a blast anywhere regardless where we were... The restaurant is pretty clean, and the decorations are very inviting and nice.  The staff was super attentive and super nice....even butted in our conversations and took it to the next level, which was pretty cool I think.  The food was good, portions was great, we shared a pizza and some pasta.  Overall a good experience I have no reason not to come back."}
{"text":"A friend was itching for some Italian food last weekend and wanted to try some place different so we looked on Yelp and saw the good reviews for this place. They offer gluten free pasta so I was game. I ordered the Tuscan pasta dish with spinach, artichokes and feta cheese, along the GF noodles. It didn't taste like there was any sauce on it, just the veggies and cheese. I added pepper and salt, but it was still a bit lacking. My friend got their spaghetti with meatballs and an order of garlic bread. I have to say that it was disappointing to me that, like so many other restaurants that offer a GF pasta noodle, they did not go the extra mile to offer a gluten free garlic bread is beyond me. Garlic bread and pasta go together like Forrest and Jenny! Aaand no GF dessert either.  This is why they garner 2 stars and a big Meh from me."}
{"text":"To begin, the service was great.  However, the ravioli seemed frozen and the meatballs in the spaghetti and meatballs were flavorless.  A lackluster meal all around."}
{"text":"Had their pizza again recently and I liked it better than the first time.  This place is great when I'm in the mood for pizza with a bit of a thicker and crispier crust.  Their pasta dishes sound awesome too."}
{"text":"Been here a handful of times over the course of many years. Went again recently and had a salad, fried zucchini and a pepperoni pizza. Everything was very good and the service was excellent. It's kind of an out of the way place, but it's definitely worth going to."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood place with the same owners and consistent quality for the last 20 years. Anti pasta salad and wings and you can't go wrong!  Pizza is one of the better ones too. Friendly and fast service (we did let them know we were on our way to a concert)....."}
{"text":"I really don't want to hurt a small business, and normally I would send a private message to the owners through Yelp, but they do not have that option. I literally would give them 1 star, but again I don't want to hurt a small business so I will compromise (giving 3 stars will hurt less than 1 star in their overall ratings).  We used to eat here often until about 15 years ago. They USED to have an awesome Philly cheese steak!! That was our go-to order! My dad even used to meet up with all of his buddy's on a weekly basis and they ALL ordered the Philly! We stopped going when, like other posters have noted, we had a deal and they refused to honor it despite their excuse for not honoring it being NON-EXISTENT in the fine print!!   Well, we were going to be in the area and we decided to fill our craving for a good Philly!! I think it used to be a prime rib Philly, now it is sirloin. I ordered the \"smaller\" version and my hubby ordered the \"larger\" version. The problem is that his \"larger\" version had very little meat!!! Mine as a \"smaller\" version had just as much meat as the \"whole\" sandwich!! My hubby kept making comments comparing our sandwiches as he ate his \"bread sandwich\". Since he asked for no onions and no mushrooms (and since there was minimal meat), he literally had a bread sandwich!!! To make matters worse, the meat just wasn't the same... AND for $10.00, my hubby's puny sandwich did NOT include a side!! To make matters double worse, my hubby's bread was overcooked and dry!!  So my hubby ate his bread sandwich and I could see the hunger in his eyes despite having finished his sandwich... so I gave him half of mine!! I really didn't mind, because I didn't think it was very good!!! I called my dad and told him not to feel like he is missing out not being in the area and not being able to enjoy as he used to do for so many years. It is a good memory, and that is ALL!!! We won't be back!!  NOTE to owner:  Having gone there for so many years so faithfully, along with many family members and friends, we stopped going when you refused to honor a deal/coupon. That was the last time we went for about 15 years. I notice another poster was recently very upset about their deal not being honored despite no fine print as a warning. You do often offer deals. You NEED TO HONOR THEM!!! It will cost you a LOT MORE when you REFUSE to honor them because, like us, people will not return!!! You lost years and years of our business over a few bucks by not honoring a deal YOU OFFERED!! NOT a smart business move!! With that said, someone needs to be accountable for making sure that the meals are served in a way that will make this business PROUD!!!  You are lucky that I'm not posting pictures!!! We are so very disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"First the good. Pleasant ambiance and friendly staff. The onion rings were crispy and delicious. The side salad not only good size and fresh but properly served. The bleh: deep frying the eggplant parmigean. The veal parm was also deep fried, but that is less a sin against Italian cuisine. Of course, the veal wasn't a real cutlet. This is a good place for non-picky families, but not for us."}
{"text":"Thank you Barbara for having such great food, great atmosphere and great servers! Shout out to our server tonight Mitzi! She is super efficient and outgoing! I would definitely love to be served by her again! Thanks again and see you soon!   -Beth"}
{"text":"The service is excellent; while they do not take reservations the wait was reasonable.   The food is basic and a high quality.  The pasta is fresh and the specialty.  Too prone to over-eating here"}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood Italian family restaurant. The lobster ravioli is my favorite here. Delicious garlic bread is served with your meal as well. Great service and food!"}
{"text":"OMG what a gold mine.  i found this restaurant on Yelp close to my hotel and feeling so grateful.  this is the best italian i have had in years.  Everything tasted incredible, from the lasagna to the salad.  the garlic bread was amazing.  Wow - what a gem of a place.  friendly staff and beautiful decor.  when i am back in Phoenix, would go out of my way to visit again.  thank you for a truly memorable dining experience!"}
{"text":"Food is great. Prices are good. Lunch menu has a great variety. Awesome staff. Cathy is great."}
{"text":"Great food, great service.  My Daughter, her friend and I split the Caesar Salad andthe Combination pasta plate, it was perfect amount for the 3 of us. The parmesan cheese is fresh and delicious, the Lasanga was delicious.  Must try"}
{"text":"This restaurant has such a warm family feeling. The food and service was outstanding!  Loved it!!"}
{"text":"My office is close to this restaurant now and I was craving for GREAT itialian food.  I have not been there for years but I remembered how yummy their food was. The young waitress was very friendly, courteous and I asked her should I get the pizza or one of the other lunch special specials? She did mention receiving a salad with the meal and suggested the pizza is the BEST! The WORST thing the waitress could do was not come back to me with a salad that I thought I was going to receive. One of her customers came in and she had a longgggg conversation and totally forgot me as a customer and still waiting for my salad. Waiting for about 15 minutes.... I stood up and told 2 other employees who were having a break at a table.  They attended to me with the salad and one of them explained that I really wasn't suppose to have had the salad with the pizza.  I explained that the young lady and I were talking about 2 different type of lunches and I thougt she said salad was complimenting both.  I then told the other employee IF the young lady came back to check back on me-IF I needed anything, she could have told me then I wasn't suppose to have received a salad, BUT there was \"no\" checking back on me at all!  I also was waiting for a refill on my drink and told them again I was waiting and I was going to the bathroom.  At this time I was totally disgusted. :(  Then when I walked out of the bathroom, the young lady was talking about how I wasnt suppose to have received the salad.  I interrupted her and said IF she would have only checked back with me, I would have been ok with her level of service. I haven't been back since and not sure IF I ever will. The OTHER employee did comp me as she said she WANTED me to come back and she was sorry. This is a mom and shop restaurant and I am shocked that with ALL the restaurants going out of business that this level of service exists. This wasnt a real recent visit but thought it should be mentioned."}
{"text":"Our first visit to this restaurant via Groupon.  Have to say, was very pleasantly surprised! I chose the Pasta Combo, while my partner chose the Tucson Pasta.  We started off with the Honey BBQ Wings.  Have to say: 1. All was delicious! 2. Our Waitress (Magdalen) was phenomenal!  As was the additional wait-staff that assisted in keeping our drinks filled and ensuring our meal was on spot! 3. Menu was more than anticipated.  Arriving at the location, we thought it was just pizza, however, they have an extensive seafood, pasta, as well as pizza menu. This is a restaurant that we will add to our list of favorites.  As a side note - checked the Maricopa County Restaurant inspection - this restaurant has pretty much had a grade A since 2012."}
{"text":"This place was very friendly and great for families.  I had the veal parmigiana and my colleague had the egg plant parmigiana.  Both meals came with salad and French bread (or garlic).  The meals were outstanding and service was great.  Our waitress was very friendly and did her best to be on top of things.  Also, when we asked about her favorite meal she was very quick at responding to her favorite.  I hate it when we ask and they say \"well\" and give a cop out answer.  Everything was great aside from the French bread it was a little too cold.  Wasn't stale but it would be nice if they were warm.  Otherwise I recommend this place for anyone who likes Italian food.  Also, found it strange they had teriyaki chicken on the menu.  Everything was in line, but teriyaki chicken?"}
{"text":"good food but sitting there I hear a manager Ashley be very rude and disrespectful to a co-work.  Life is full of haters I do not want to be around it when I an enjoying a meal."}
{"text":"One of our favorite neighborhood pizza restaurants. We've also tried a few Italian entrées. For take out for two, we generally order the small 10 inch Hawaiian pizza and two dinner salads with Italian dressing. $22 plus tip. Price a little hiGh but Worth a little more for a consistently excellent pizza. We ask for the pizza well done because typically our pizza gets soggy in the center.  I would definitely recommend Anzio's for their pizza."}
{"text":"We've been here twice now and really enjoyed ourselves! The staff is very friendly and attentive.  Our drinks arrived quickly and our order was taken very promptly. Our food arrived shortly there after and was piping hot.  The menu is kind of interesting because as well as Italian food and pizza, there is quite a variety of café type food. We've always had the Italian food and it was quite delicious. Pretty basic Italian comfort food. My husband absolutely loves the lasagna and says it's the best fettuccine he's had.  We never have enough room left in our stomachs for dessert but they look wonderful and are huge!  We will definitely return to Anzio's."}
{"text":"I come here occasionally with the family and we just love it here. The staff has shown that they know customer service and are committed to it. The food is as always excellent. A very nice Italian atmosphere."}
{"text":"Anzios is a cute little Italian restaurant that has some tasty food options. I had their lasagna which came with garlic bread (decent) and soup or salad (got the soup...they said they make it from scratch, but it was a bit on the salty and canned veggie side...not terrible though). The lasagna was tasty and the portion was large (enough to take half home). We also had the tiramisu, which was large and delicious. Is this the best Italian in town? No, but it's solid. They also have a Groupon so you can get a fabulous deal. I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite place for Italian food! Last night we had a small (10 people) birthday dinner for our granddaughter. We truly enjoyed our experience. Our server, Tricia, was fantastic, she exceeded all our needs. At the end of the meal they surprised The birthday girl with a HUGE ice cream sundae in a radio flyer wagon! Anzios is a small place with a big heart and great food. Thanks for making our dinner memorable!!"}
{"text":"If food were the only rating factors, I'd have given our Anzios experience an additional star (3).  I was disappointed ownership decided that smack-dab in the middle of the noon lunch hour (12:15) indoor construction (saws, nail guns, etc) on the booths was exceptable.  We were shocked!"}
{"text":"Fabulous casual family Italian restaurant. Our friendly server, Carol was on the ball. The food was delicious. Yummy garlic bread, really good chicken noodle soup and a wonderful Cesar dressing. Tempting wine list. Mini canollis, made in house, were wonderful. The lunch special was the perfect size. We will be back with the rest of the family. It looks like they do a big take out biz too. The restaurant also is amazingly decorated."}
{"text":"Chicken parm was thin and dried out spaghetti was real mediocre   The toast was assume. I try to support my local businesses but sorry this is bad"}
{"text":"Loving the zesty Italian aromas...and the pizza   definently is the icing of the cake. Customer service was excellent. I'll definently be coming back. :)"}

{"text":"Went here for the first time and it surpassed our expectations! The food was fantastic and we received outstanding service from Trish who went above and beyond for us. We even received a complimentary dessert for being first-timers. We will return and ask for Trish!!"}
{"text":"Had delicious delivery tonight and was very happy with everything! I had the fettuccini alfredo and I may be the pickiest person when it comes to my alfredo- and I was beyond happy with it! I have found my go to place for my fav pasta. Delivery was fast and this is now my go to place!!"}
{"text":"I decided to take my friend here for her birthday. The reviews were good, and as I read there was a Groupon for this place. Who doesn't like to save some money? Unfortunately, I wasn't overly impressed. The food was ok but nothing to rave about. Out of the 6 of us we all got something different. No one in my group had anything great to say about the food, the main highlight being that it didn't seem too greasy and the portions were ok. The garlic bread came out cold and our food wasn't brought to the table at the same time. Our waiter was friendly, though I never received a refill on my soda. I had expected a little more from this place based on the reviews. My out of town friend specifically asked for a non-chain Italian restaurant, but she and I both agreed that for the same price, Olive Garden would have been the better option. I think if this place simply added more flavor to their foods as a whole, and had a slightly more attentive staff, they would deserve 4 stars rather than 3."}
{"text":"Very cool place! The atmosphere was awesome and the staff was great. Maggie, our waitress, was on it! Never left you hanging or wanting for anything. The food was good, I thought my meal was heavy on the sauce but thats a preference thing and nothing to do with quality. I will eat here again, I'm looking forward to it!"}
{"text":"After finding this place on Groupon (and I am a big Groupon user), I decided to give this a shot. Being from NJ, where the Italian population is quite high and every other restaurant is a pizza or Italian place, I would like to think that my standards for Italian food are higher than average. In the end, the food is slightly above average but I wouldn't exactly call this authentic Italian food. If you go in expecting Americanized Italian food, then it's not bad at all.  I ordered the lobster ravioli while my girlfriend ordered the combination dinner (manicotti, chicken parmigiana, and fettucine alfredo). Portion sizes were definitely on the bigger side, so that was a plus. The lobster in the lobster ravioli wasn't exactly the freshest and who could blame them really? The closest source of lobster isn't for at least a thousand miles. The sauce itself was VERY cheesy and there was so much of it that I had to buy pasta at home to even out the pasta to sauce ratio. I would say my dish was just OK. My girlfriend's dish was better than mine and I actually did enjoy the chicken parmigiana. The fettucine alfredo was pretty standard and the manicotti (like the lobster ravioli) was a bit over-sauced but tasty. I would have liked my pasta more al dente, but that's just my personal preference. Both dishes came with either soup or salad, and garlic or french bread. I do have to admit that the garlic bread was amazing - awesome crustiness on the outside, warm and soft on the inside.  As for the service, the waitress was very sociable, attentive, and nice. No complaints about the service here. It was relatively busy when we went but we were seated immediately. I can't comment about their pizza, but I would try if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This place has been here forever and when you go it is obvious why...it rocks.  Great pizza and wings...so good, I haven't tried any of there actual entrees and I've been there close to 100 times...okay maybe 50.  And I'm always amazed how we can order a big salad, a sampler platter, wings and a couple of pizzas to feed about 10 of us and the bill is like $60...yes 10 of us!  There is a great area in the back for private parties that you wouldn't even know about unless someone told you or you got lucky enough to be invited to one.  Great for groups and families."}
{"text":"This was always the restaurant my grandma would take me to as a kid. We loved their pastas and the creamy Italian dressing is a must have. Make sure to go in on wing night, they deep fry their wings and the buffalo sauce is like nothing you've ever had before."}
{"text":"Our party of four enjoyed a delicious meal at Anzio's tonight!  We each had a different entree and found our meal to be exceptional.  The restaurant has a charming atmosphere and our server, Robert, was fun and attentive.  We had a wonderful dinner and hope to return soon!"}
{"text":"Delicious garlic bread! Very nice people, cute atmosphere"}
{"text":"We like it here, always good food and almost always great service. The only thing is we always ask for \"half dozen\" of BBQ and 1/2 dz of the suicide wings and ALWAYS always always they bring me the whole dozen of each! Never fails!  That gets a little old after awhile.. I swear I've been there ten times and easily 8 out of the 10 times they've gotten the order wrong.  But like I said the food is really good so I'll most likely keep going back :)"}
{"text":"The food is good. Don't get me wrong with my rating but it is based on the server who we encountered with a bad attitude. Slow, rude and argumentative then blamed it all on being sooo busy with the few tables that she had to serve.  The other servers seemed to be on their game and got customers seated, served and cashed out within a reasonable time frame. Our lunch took an hour and a half for two small pizzas and a salad. At least we didn't get sick like our one of fellow reviewers.  ** I do not recommend this place if your in a hurry, but if your tolerant of a potential bad service experience then the food so far has been pretty good."}
{"text":"Anzio's is a great little Italian place.  The antipasto salad with bread is a nice light meal for 2 people.  Add some fried zucchini and shoestring potatoes for a treat.   The pizza is very nice as is the chicken parm.  My only complete is the place is cold temperture-wise."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim after making spaghetti at home and hating the new sauce we tried that time.... olive garden wait time was over 1.5 hrs, so I saw this place.  Never ordering olive garden again!  Alfredo sauce is some of the best the wife and I have tried!  Have been several times since.  Seating is tight inside, but they stay busy, which is a good sign!  Doesn't look like much outside, but if you are reading this and have never tried, DO IT NOW!"}
{"text":"First visit last night, Friday evening. Went there based on Yelp reviews and we were not disappointed. We got there before the dinner rush and we're seated quickly. We were seated in a booth and it was a tight fit, not much room there. Next time we go we'll sit at a table. Ordered a basket of cheese garlic bread and wine. Wine good and cheese bread very good. When ordering our dinners the menu said it came with bread. We didn't realize the bread is an entire basket of bread. We had lots of bread. Next time we'll forego the cheese bread appitizer and get something else.  As for the entrees, they were all excellent. Generous portions, we had traditional spaghetti and meatballs, feticini Alfredo and chicken and broccoli which came with pasta in an Alfredo sause. Really good, all of it. Service was very good and prices very reasonable. This is a homey, casual place, very comfortable. As we left, there were about one dozen people standing outside waiting to be called for their table. A very nice find and will definately be back."}
{"text":"Early Sunday evening with another couple and our kids. Surprisingly the place wasn't that busy, the 7 of us sat in the middle of the dining room but still have in view of the TV's in the small bar area to watch playoff football.  Drink order taken and a few minutes when are young waitress returned she took our order. We opted for the pizza and wing special with the addition of a meat lovers pizza. I ordered a cup of chicken noodle soup.  Pepperoni pizza delivered along with our 30 wings. 10 medium, great sauce. Not too spicy with the traditional vinegar tang. 10 BBQ, run of the mill. 10 sweet and spicy, I don't really know how to describe these wings, but sweet and spicy. Tang and spiciness of the medium but with a hint of sweetness. Really good. Meat lovers delivered shortly there after.  Pepperoni pizza is pepperoni pizza. The meat lovers is another story. Loaded with toppings, finely diced sausage and bacon with cheese that was a golden brown  The soup, clearly homemade but lacking in something.  Kids meals reasonably priced starting at $5.25  This is a great local mom and pop restaurant and they have a large back room for banquets and meetings. Service was good, nothing spectacular but for the young waitstaff it will do."}
{"text":"Shout out to Yelp again for finding me a great place to dine at. The deals & combinations that dey have are amazing. The parking lot out front saves you the headache of searching for parking. The waitress was great. Very consistent, quick, polite, & funny. The toasted ravioli was delicious. But my main dish, the 3 in 1 meal was off the chain. But the most unbelievable part of it all was the entire meal was under $30. Which is always a plus on vacation lol. The portions were so much I ended up wit a nice doggie bag to take back to the hotel for a late night snack. This little Italian spot definitely gets my seal of approval as a must visit."}
