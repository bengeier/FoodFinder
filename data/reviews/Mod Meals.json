{"text":"I had the BBQ brisket and it was amazing. They delivered it to my work and I popped it in the fridge that night and made it the next day for dinner. It tasted just like a homemade meal! It's the perfect size for one person, I will definitely be ordering again soon!"}
{"text":"I got really excited about Mod Meals when they started, I ordered a handful of times. The sandwiches from Flying Fig never disappoint. I wasn't too thrilled with the indian selection I ordered. But then it started to feel stale. The menu doesn't change enough. I'm vegetarian so if you don't like what they have as the option then you have to wait a week or two. If I remember too. With Uber eats coming to Cleveland I found that more convient with more options. But, if you happen to like whats on the menu this week, give it a shot."}
{"text":"I agree with everything in Roxanne's and Lauren's reviews.  I absolutely love the concept.  The service and packaging were phenomenal.  The food was good, but the value was not.  I had the chicken tinga tacos, and the chicken was flavorful and the salsas were exceptional.  I would have been more satisfied with a complete meal for the price.  Maybe include a salad or slaw or some chips or something.    I'd also like to see them post menus in advance.  There have been a few times when I'm having company and planning to order take-out, but can't plan on getting Mod Meals because I'm not sure if what they're offering that day will be acceptable for everyone.  If I have to take the time to make a back-up plan, then I'm just going to make that my plan, you know?  They recommended I just order food earlier in the week if they have something I want, then reheat it when I want it.  But that really defeats their whole \"fresh from the farm this morning\" thing.  I gave them 5 stars anyway because a gift card to Mod Meals is the exact thing I've been searching for to give to all my friends when they have babies.  This service is tailor-made for gifting meals to people when you're not exactly sure when is convenient or what they like to eat.  There are things I think they could do better, but right now this really is as good as it gets in Cleveland for meal delivery."}
{"text":"Hells yes.  Let's see...what's not to love.  Take all of your fave independent eateries in CLE, have them prepare delicious fare, pick what you want on their Web site, and BOOM, dinner is delivered to your doorstep that night.  I received a text saying, \"I am on my way if you want to preheat your oven to 375.\"  How Rockstar is that?   And voila, just like that, pot roast and Yukon gold potatoes from the Flying Fig and a cherry chocolate cookie from Spice are on my front door step.  Dig it.  Perhaps the biggest plus?  They only charge $2.95 as a delivery fee.  You cannot beat that."}
{"text":"This is the second time we've ordered and we continue to be impressed! When ordering online, we failed to get a confirmation email but customer service was helpful and promptly told us our meals were on their way. Drivers text when close with message to heat oven if we're eating now. Nice touch.   And the food! Tonight included a roasted eggplant sandwich and soup. Sandwich was huge and super flavorful. Overall, the sandwiches have all been great. So full that the soup will be lunch tomorrow. Also ordered kale verde caesar with spiced chicken. Salad dressing was amazing!! Tea house chicken and noodles was a little bland but perfect for kids. My daughter loved it. Haven't had the peanut butter pie yet but how can that be bad!?"}
{"text":"We had the Memphis barbecue brisket. It was delicious! Tender and smoky.  We will definitely order again."}
{"text":"I love the concept of Mod Meals - pick from a short list of items created daily by local chefs, click a couple buttons, and then food is whisked to your home or business.   The good:  - The web site offers great descriptions and pictures of the items available. - Menu items are clearly labeled for people with special dietary needs - vegan, gluten free, etc.  - The packaging is really innovative and pretty - Great communication from delivery driver when order is on its way - Staff responds quickly when you send an email   The not so good:  - From what I saw, there wasn't a way to tip online - as a person who rarely has cash, this seemed inconvenient - My food (all vegan - vegetable salad and mushroom tacos) was ok - but nothing was amazing. I expect to pay restaurant prices for high quality restaurant food but I also expect to enjoy my meal and not feel starving afterwards.   I definitely think this is a great concept and once the kinks are worked out, I think they'll serve up great meals all around town. I just think that they need to keep working on refining their menu to provide good food at a better value. (or better food at the same price)"}
{"text":"I was so psyched when I read about Mod Meals in Scene magazine, that I actually ordered a meal for that night. Such a cool concept....ordered short rib with veggies and potatoes from Flying Fig for $14. The service is also pretty great; in accordance with Jen's comment, they let you know when they're close so you can pre-heat the oven, and a $3 delivery fee isn't much to sneeze at.   However, with how excited i was about the price and anticipated quality of the meal, I was a little bummed by what I came home to. It was a very small, and sort of sad-looking amount of food on a sort of cafeteria tray. The vegetables weren't much to speak of, and the short rib was incredibly fatty. I felt I didn't get my money's worth, especially when there are so many places in Cleveland (i.e., India Garden) where you can get heaps and heaps of delicious food for the same price. I may try it again because I desperately want to love Mod Meals, but I was left feeling a little empty inside...."}
{"text":"Just wanted to update my initial take on Mod Meals. We have used the service two more times--including last night--since our first review and both times the food was great.  Last night we had Chef Sawyer's BBQ pulled pork with bun & slaw and Chef Sawyer's grand knife Caesar. Both were excellent, the pulled pork sandwich surprisingly so. \"Surprisingly so\" not because we didn't expect it to be very good but because it was flat-out outstanding. We can't wait to have it again. And the portion size was not skimpy in the slightest. Yum.   It is SO very convenient to have Mod Meals as option. No more worrying you couldn't get something together or didn't have the time to go out. Let the (really excellent) food come to you. Seriously, this is an awesome concept and I encourage doubters to give it a try."}
