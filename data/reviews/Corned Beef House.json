{"text":"I always make sure I stop in to the CBH whenever I'm in Toronto. If you like massive mounds of delicious deli meat, this place is for you. Great sandwiches, good sides and a great staff."}
{"text":"This place isn't very noticeable when walking by, but is definitely worth popping in once you spot it. The massive sandwiches are delicious, especially the beef brisket. Service was awesome, our waiter was very knowledgeable and humorous. It was pretty dead during the midweek lunch, but would be a good place to go with friends at night for a drink. The atmosphere is great, it's very welcoming, and has a bar that calls our your name."}
{"text":"Go for the meat, stay for the chat you're having with the dude who makes you feel like you've known him since the early 90's. Good vibes.  The meat is really effing good, and as a former Montrealer and Schwartz's regular, my opinion carries some seriously fatty, steamed, well-seasoned weight. Although not melt-in-your mouth like Schwartz's, Corned Beef House has some of the best smoked meat and corned beef I've had outside of Habs Town.  My fave here is the Reuben, but given the tastiness of the meat, the basic Montreal and corned beef sandwiches are both highly recommended as well. Now I'm just waiting for CBH to team up with the Pizzaiolo downstairs and make a smoked meat pizza!  These dudes lose half a star as a result of a few small things: prices are JUST too high, they ditched their after-6pm deal after they moved, and their signage is just insufficient for this busy corner. I dislike that this means I have to explain their location relative to Hooters."}
{"text":"I came here after the auto show on a Saturday just a bit before closing, but the waitress still welcomed us in very politely. I've always wanted to try this place out and finally decided to when I came across a groupon (two sandwich platters for the price of one).    It had been a long day apparently, so the choice of bread was limited. It was not a big deal though. I settled for the Montreal Smoked Meat sandwich with honey mustard, and my friend decided on the Corned Beef with dijon. The platter also comes with fries, coleslaw, and a delicious pickle. My friend also got a cup of coffee because it's free! How can you go wrong with free coffee?  The only iffy thing was that they mixed up the mustards. The dijon mustard ended up on mine, which took away from the delicious smoked meat flavour because the dijon flavour is too strong for me. However, my friend and I swapped half of our sandwiches, so I got to try the corned beef with the honey mustard. SO GOOD! I will have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed the corned beef more.  All in all, the service is great (even at the end of a long day), and the atmosphere of the place is very chill and relaxing. I will be returning!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and myself come here almost every Saturday for lunch and they have the best club sandwich ever (fresh crispy lettuce/tomato, warm toasted toast, grilled chicken breast with bacon).  The corn beef sandwich is one of the best in Toronto.  You will get the best friendliest service.  Must try!!!!!"}
{"text":"We've been in Toronto for 4 days and we've eaten here 3 times. YUM. YUM. Incredible poutine! I'd never tried this French fries/cheese curds/gravy dish before and this was a great place to dive in... Amazing Montreal Smoked Meat Sammies, too. SUPER COOL STAFF here, as well. Wish I lived next door."}
{"text":"I work in the area and this place is a very popular place. I've eaten here a couple of times and I think the lunch special is great since it comes with half a pint of beer. I would say this is this a very popular place among guys - Everyone I know who comes here on a regular basis is a guy! Personally the sandwiches have waaay too much meat for my liking, but the sandwiches definitely taste good. I think next time I will just ask for less meat ;)"}
{"text":"I'm from Montreal and I have to say this was the best smoked meat I've had in years. The beer, the atmosphere and the service were just amazing. A definite spot to visit."}
{"text":"Wow,  The best Sambo i think i have had in TO... I had the roast beef with honey mayo.. A-mazing! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Wandered in for lunch and was impressed with the friendly and helpful staff and virtually no wait at all.  It's pretty easy to miss this place as the signage is minimal at best.   I ordered the corned beef on rye (smallest size) along with fries and the portion sizes were huge - easily enough to feed 2.  Corned beef was smoked perfectly and the fries were a bit on the greasy side - perfect compliment to the deli sandwich.   Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's easy to miss because the entrance is literally a hole in a giant wall off Adelaide & John. The staff are nice and service is great (Brenda with the tats!). Love the old nostalgic decor with n&w pics of Muhammad Ali & The Beatles. It terms of food my go to sandwiches are Montreal Smoked Meat and the Reuben. I opt for the large size poutine as my side dish and it'll keep you full for a long time. My only gripe is that it closes at 9pm weekdays. I don't think they get the traffic from before or after the Jaya games so that can work as an advantage to you vs going to Hooters across the corner (which packs up quick) during Jays games. Bee on tap i go with Amsterdam Blonde (they use to have Creemore). Enjoy :D"}
{"text":"Located at the corner of John and Adelaide, I almost missed it as I walked right past the front door facing Adelaide street.  I had the Reuben for lunch which came to $8.49 plus tax/tips.  It was delicious!  The corned beef sandwich with swiss cheese and sauerkraut came quickly and is served with half a giant pickle. The bread (marbled rye) was fresh, light, soft, and crispy (grilled with butter) to perfection.  The meat was thinly shaved and piled on high/piping hot - so high that it was a challenge to take a bite out of it.  If you can manage to fit a bite in your mouth, the whole thing melts and its heavenly. The pieces were not very fatty though there were some fat around it but the meat tasted very fresh and light.  The fries were the home cut kind with skin and were very delicious!  The service was good and fast.  I had a glass of water with ice very promptly.  I could only finish half and they were nice enough to bring me a take-out box for the other half and a brown paper bag.  Our waitress was friendly and personable.  We went as a group of 13 and they were able to seat us all during lunchtime.  The only thing they couldn't do was separate bills but they were willing to process individual credit card payments.  I haven't tried the other items though people at my table ordered the turkey and montreal smoked meat.  Their order looked ok but I think the Reuben should be what you go for at this establishment. I would definitely recommend ordering the Reuben for a dollar more!!  I did not try the poutine but after looking at the pics, definitely will try it next time!"}
{"text":"How much I miss this place! Simply awesome sandwiches, great quality, super delicious. One of my favorite downtown eateries, without a doubt!"}
{"text":"This place is always great- ordered a lunch take out for my office, 14 sandwiches and all my coworkers loved it. Some underestimated the size of the Gigantic (there version of a medium size) Great portions, great taste. The closest thing you can get to an original Smoked Montreal Meat in Toronto.  If you plan to order take out during the lunch hour I would recommend calling in or you will be waiting for a long time. The place tends to fill up very quickly."}
{"text":"My husband found this place and insisted I try this place. All I gots to say is , best corned beef sandwich ever!!!! Meat is fresh and plenty. It comes with a side of fries or their fresh potato salad. They also play this amazing selection of oldies that takes me right back to my childhood days. I would go back again."}
{"text":"Damn good all the way around.  Rueben was great, bartender was friendly, belly is very full."}
{"text":"I came here on my lunch break and nabbed one of only two seats left in the place (both were at the bar). So, it gets very busy at lunch.  Because it was busy, I had to wait about 25-30 minutes for a Montreal smoked meat sandwich/platter. Once I got it, I had to wolf it down to make sure I got back to work on time. It looked like some people had to wait even longer.  If you're on your lunch break and you're in a rush, this could be a roll of the dice.  But the food is good and plentiful, no complaints there."}
{"text":"The place looks OK from the outside. They need to get something that would distinguish them on the street instead of having people telling you that it's across from Hooters... Nice cozy set up inside though.  First time I came here, I ordered corned beef poutine. I'm not a huge poutine fan, but they make awesome poutine. The second time I went there, I got their huge brisket sandwich; it taste fantastic!  Food price is decent for lunch Servers were very friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"Went here with my mom after a morning of shopping. Everything we had at this place was tasty (Huge Rubens, coleslaw and poutine). Could only eat half a \"huge\" sized sandwich with the sides. Everything was flavourful and there were several bread and mustard options."}
{"text":"Yuuuummmmm!   I came here after a recommendation from my hotel. It was making me hungry hearing him describe the place so I had to come.   I ordered the Montreal smoked meat with Dijon on rye by itself. It was plenty filling for me. The meat was thinly sliced and juicy. The bread had just the right chewiness to it. It was amazing.   Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"So good!  Very well priced for the amount of food you get.  The Reuben was so tasty. Not at all salty or overdone. Coleslaw was alright, sauerkraut was tasteful. Fries were good. I had my Reuben with honey Dijon and I recommend it, as it usually comes with a ranch sauce.    Atmosphere is casual and the staff are very friendly. I went on a Monday during lunch... This place is 70% men and 30% female. Just sayin :)"}
{"text":"This place isn't that good. If you've ever eaten real smoked meat  n Montreal (in Toronto try Caplansky's), don't bother with this place. The restaurant has a cool design but the food was disappointing. The only thing I enjoyed were the fries. We tried both the corned beef and the smoked meat and they were chewy and not authentic. The owner was very nice, but I didn't appreciate that he tried to engage us in a political discussion while we were just trying to have a private conversation."}
{"text":"A trip to TO would not be complete without a visit to The Corned Beef House. Friendly staff and the food is great! Well proportioned servings.  I had the corned beef on marble rye with medium mustard and a crisp dill pickle.  Best sandwhich in TO? I haven't been to all, but it would be hard to beat! Can't beat the place that names itself after its food!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot to grab a quick bite to eat before checking out a movie down the road.  Every time I get the gigantic corned beef on a kaiser with regular mustard.  You just can't go wrong with that.  Definitely get a portion of fries as well.  They are crispy, taste fantastic, and large enough to share.  And I always order extra pickles."}
{"text":"This place is a little hidden, I finally saw it when I was walking to Queen Street a few weeks ago. And finally, had a chance to try it out as we needed something quick to eat before watching a musical. It was not very busy when we went in, there was only a few tables. I ordered the Montreal smoked meat sandwich on rye bread with honey mustard - the huge size which is just the smallest one. And the sandwich was big, huge stack of meat! It was hard to eat as a sandwich as everything felt apart. It was delicious with the honey mustard, a little sweet.  Compared to the famous Montreal Schwartz's - it is still now as good. Now, it has been years since I had that sandwich but to my memory, their meat was a bit more flavourful. But I don't have to wait an hour in line and don't have to drive 5 hours for the sandwich. So this place definitely satisfy my smoke beef sandwich craving."}
{"text":"I come here about 4 or 5 times a year and its by far the best corned beef I have ever had.  Owners and staff very friendly.  Washroom always been clean.  The roast beef has been a bit fatty or greasy sometimes but still very edible.  From reading some of reviews I must try the fries sometime."}
{"text":"If you want a delicious meaty treat, this is the place to go! I got a roast beef sandwich piled high between delicious rye bread with a really delectable spicy sausage soup. What can say, I love meat! So, if you're a meat lover as well, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"My wife and I kinda ended up here by accident after watching a movie at the Cineplex movie theatre.  It was fairly dead when we got in so we weren't sure what to expect but damn! These guys know how to make an awesome Rueben and Montreal smoked meat sandwich!"}
{"text":"Room was nice, but quiet, service was great (waitress terrific, quick, friendly), but the food was \"meh.\"  At best.    Corned beef was flavorless, uninteresting, bread cut thick and overpowered the beef (though the portion was VERY large).  Onion rings were awful - worst kind of Sysco freezer *&^#%.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, has always been, I absolutely love it.   Been going there for years, from when they were originally located in an old home down the road at 303 Adelaide, to now at the corner of Adelaide and John.   I dont get there as much anymore due to the lack of parking, but was fortunate enough to walk by the other week, walking my friends dog, called in my order from the sidewalk, and they delivered it to me on the street. hehe  About a year a go, I paid the exorbitant downtown parking prices just to get a sandwich from there. so in the end my 10$ or so sandwich ended upp costing me near 25$ but it was worth every penny.  Gotta love the sandwich sizes. Huge, Gigantic and Colossal! Never tired their Colossal, but the Gigantic has always been more than enough for me.  In Toronto. Montreal Smoked Meat done right, as well their namesake, Corned Beef. Unlike a few other places that have came and went, they know what they are doing when they add in the half dill pickle at no extra charge. (Needless to say I have been shocked when I have ordered a corned or smoked meat from one of the now defunct similar places, and they charge extra for the dill - really? Does the sandwich and pickle not go hand in hand?)  Highly recommended! A++"}
{"text":"Yummy. Corned beef sandwich was good. Will try the Montreal for sure next time. Great service"}
{"text":"Love a good stacked meat sandwich, and this place did not disappoint. I got the Montreal smoked meat, and my girlfriend got the beef brisket..  both were outstanding. Eaten at similar well regarded joints in NYC, Philly and Montreal and CBH was just as good.  Place was a bit empty, although it was 4pm. Nice diner/pub like setting and the service was actually great.  Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"The special is back! $6 sandwich after 6pm...yes!  EDIT: the special might be 4-6pm. Just tell 'em Bryan G. sent you and I'm sure you'll get the hook up.  HUMOUROUS STORY I saw the guy putting up the sign for the special while walking with my roommate and excitedly yelled \"IT'S BACK! YES! THE SPECIAL IS BACK!\" to which the dude (who would recognize us as the guys who used to come all the time but stopped as soon as the special stopped) looked up at me, laughed, nodded and said \"See you soon\" and then proceeded to tell the guy helping him with the sign that we're the motherfuckers who will only come to his shop if we can get a ridiculous deal. Everybody knows the score. Now I'm gonna get me a corned beef sammich...after 6."}
{"text":"I was waiting for a matinee at the Princess of Wales of theatre and I was craving Montreal smoked meat sandwich-i ordered it with the medium spicy mustard, and I requested the \"fatty\" brisket which the server accommodated. I also had English breakfast eat (it's a pub!) and the server brought milk and two bags in case the tea wasn't strong enough! Excellent service, great food and reasonable priced! It isn't Schwartz' Deli but it was very good!"}
{"text":"Montreal Smoked Meat is pretty good.  Colossal size as well.  The potato salad not so much.  Parking absolutely sucks so it's difficult to stop by for a sandwich."}
{"text":"1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent  Food: 4 Service: 3 Ambiance: 3 Overall: 3.5  Extra information:  * Serves sandwiches, soup and salad * Closed on Sunday * Open for lunch and dinner * Good for family * Serves alcohol  I first found out about Corned Beef House on facebook, my friend uploaded a photo of giant sandwich filled with layers of meat and I couldn't wait to check them out. I am in Entertainment district pretty often but didn't notice Corned Beef House until I literally looked it up. It's not tucked away, but a little hard to find around the corner just off of major street where you can find milestone, jack astor and hooters.  I decided to drop by for a dinner on a week day with a friend and walked into a restaurant pretty much empty. Corned beef house is not really set up like your ordinary deli, but more so your neighborhood bar. The atmosphere is pretty laid back and would be perfect spot for quick lunch or family dinner.  Every Monday, they have a Man VS Sandwich contest where if you consume a 40oz sandwich within 1 hour, your sandwich is free! Anyone up for the challenge? I don't think I could do it..  The menu is pretty simple, you can get a deli sandwich ( choose from Montreal smoked meat, corned beef or couple other choices) and then choose the size (Huge 7oz, Gigantic 10oz or Colossal 16oz). You can get the sandwich by itself or make it a combo by adding couple more dollars and get it with soup or salad. With the bread, you have choice of light, dark and marble rye and then choice of mustard with yellow, dijon and honey mustard.  Ordered: Corned Beef Sandwich platter 4/5  * 7oz sandwich with light rye bread and honey mustard on the side * Substituted fries for poutine, coleslaw and pickles for $13.25 * Corned beef was super flavorful and there was so much of it * light rye bread was dense and held up quite well but I still wouldn't try to hold up entire sandwich * I am not the biggest fan of poutine, but really enjoyed it at Corned beef house * Generous amounts of cheese curds on top were squeaky and delicious * Coleslaw was tangy and complemented the heavy sandwich   Ordered: Montreal Smoked Meat 4/5  * 7oz sandwich with light rye bread and dijon mustard on the side for $8.49 * This was my first time having smoked meat sandwich and honestly I couldn't tell the difference between 2 sandwiches * I enjoyed both of them nontheless * Dilled pickle on the side was juicy and just perfect  Ordered: Onion rings  * Since we were getting poutine with the platter, we decided to try their onion rings * Really large portion and loved the crispy batter   Summary: Overall I really enjoyed Smoked meat sandwiches at Corned Beef House. If you are in the entertainment district feeling hungry, check out Corned Beef House and maybe try their challenge if you are brave enough!"}
{"text":"Had smoked meat burger and CB burger with fries. A bit salty but very good. Heavy side becuz there's no vegetables at all.   Strongly recommend: fries!!!! The best I ever had.  Salad was soso. Soup was ok but still too salty. I got very thirsty after soup."}
{"text":"I am NOT a fan of corned beef or smoked meat in any way - but I can appreciate when a place does things well from the moment you step in until you leave. Despite not being a fan of the food, I ended up going there almost 6 times for lunch with co-workers and was never disappointed and would come back. This is how well they do things.  Service is excellent - can get packed around lunch but always managed to find a table. Waitresses have been there for a while (got served by the same one almost half the time) which shows low turnover and good service.  Their smoked meat is not Montreal Schwartz' quality, but it will do. Their corned beef sandwich is where it's at though. I usually have the corn beef sandwich that comes with a pickle on the side. Good option for a meal under $10 which is relatively healthy.  Recommend it to anyone that loves corned beef - and it gets a 5 star rating because it got a non-corn-beef lover to actually enjoy the place. An example of a business well-done."}
{"text":"Located on the corner of John and Adelaide (across from Hooters), this place is a good choice if you're craving stacked meat sandwiches.  The menu consists of Montreal smokes meat sandwich, turkey, Reuben and more deli sandwiches. Sizes to choose from include \"Huge\" which is 7oz, \"Giant\" which is 10oz and the \"Colossal\" which is 16oz!   I ordered the huge sized Reuben and it was enormous already! I don't know how anyone can finish the Colossal size. The meat was very tender and full of flavor, complemented with sauerkraut that they managed not to overload on. The rye bread was perfectly toasted so that it didn't rip the roof of my mouth. I wasn't a fan of the fries, which reminded me of Swiss Chalet fries. The coleslaw was a bit too watery for my taste as well.   The service was dismissive and I get that the one girl needed to wait on the whole place but she looked miserable and her attitude showed it. If this place stepped up their customer service, I would be a regular for sure!   Remember to check in on Yelp for your 10% discount!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love corned beef house. I would walk five miles uphill in the snow to get here. My favourite sandwich is the Reuben, but they're all good and it's honestly really good beef.  The smallest sandwich is always enough food for me to be stuffed.  I love going here for lunch, except if you don't go early, you won't get a seat."}
{"text":"Delicious corned beef sandwich at a very reasonable price. Be prepared for big portions whatever you get -- especially the delicious fries."}
{"text":"This place is not hygienic as I found hair in my corn beef sandwich.  When I saw it, I removed it and thought it is just hair - it won't kill me.  But then I saw another piece and it was enough to make me throw it out. Pulling hair out of my food is gross.  The cooks told me it might have come from this one container - which is still gross!!  No thank you, I will be dining somewhere else"}
{"text":"This place makes devine smoked meat sandwiches, one of the closest to Schwartz's or The Main in Montreal! The homemade cheesecake is wonderful also!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of time now.  It easy to walk by and not notice it, but make the effort and give it a try. Reasonable price for a nice big sandwich in Toronto. Not like those big chain sandwich shops everywhere in the PATH that are more bread than meat. Service was fast and friendly. Good selection meats, breads and mustards.  So good."}
{"text":"Craving for a thick, deli style, Montreal smoked meat/corned beef sandwich, my research led me to this place and this place did not disappoint. The Reuben sandwich I had was better than I thought it would be so I will boldly rate this place higher than Centre Street Deli.   For the record, I have not tried the smoked meat in Montreal which i've heard is off the charts so I might not be the best source for an accurate review. All I know is that I had a Reuben here, my wife had the corned beef, and they were both very satisfying."}
{"text":"First tried Corned Beef House at a lunch at my office and thought their cornbeef sandwich was pretty decent. Been there a few times for take away since then but never got their smoked meat sandwiches.  You can easily miss this place since it's around the corner filled with a bunch of restaurants on John St. It's hidden away with just a simple glazed door on the corner of John and Adelaide, just around the corner of Pizzaiolo.   My top pick at this joint is the good 'ol poutine. It's gotta be one of my faves in the city and inexpensive at $5.99 for a very filling box. The gravy is spot on! Tried the smoked meat poutine once but it was just too salty. Recently tried the classic BLT... It was Legit! Simple toast, lettuce and tomato, but they had a good amount of bacon. No bites went without a good chunk of bacon... Mmmm... Bacon.  I can't give it a full 5 stars cuz the service can be slow even outside of the lunch rush. But other than that, I'll be coming back for the cheap eats and maybe someday end up with a smoked sandwich.  Don't miss out on some good sandwiches and excellent poutine."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a Saturday with my boyfriend. We ordered the platter - upgraded to 10oz smoked meat sandwich + a poutine. We felt it was a good amount of food to share and was super tasty. We would return!"}
{"text":"Proper Montreal smoked meat stacked high. This is my go-to place for lunch when I'm working in Toronto. Love it!"}
{"text":"Been to the CBH a number of times now. The food is excellent and the service is friendly and usually quite fast. The sandwiches are very large so be warned, and I am told by my friend that the potato salad is great (not a potato salad fan myself). The soup is always good and hearty and the pickles are nice and sour with a good crunch. Pricing is reasonable, certainly better than other places in TO.  Great place to go before seeing a movie in the evening. Wish the place was open later though - the only reason this place is not a prefect 5 score."}
{"text":"My co-workers took me here because I wanted to try some Canadian delicacies. Did not disappoint! Very indulgent; the only downside is the post-lunch food coma afterwards.  Montreal Smoked Meat Sandwich: Very generous portion of meat. Tasted like a cross between ham and corned beef; was delicious. The tart pickle helped cut the richness of the sandwich.  Poutine: Thin crispy fries. An insane amount of cheese curds. Lots of tasty gravy. A very huge portion that is near impossible to finish if you also have a sandwich."}
{"text":"Stopped by today ..had the smoked meat on rye...wow what a sandwich..was huge...and very tasty..will be returning"}
{"text":"Best corned beef sandwich I have ever had.  Sandwich was absolutely huge....highly recommend"}
{"text":"4/5 - delicious. If you love meat.  My friends who came with me enjoyed it, but were not wowed. Me? I really enjoy it.  Now - is it as good at Katz Deli? No (go their and get their beef tongue).  But when you're in the mood for just a massive sandwich of meat, this is the place. I recommend going with the middle size, and go for the rueben - a sandwich is much better with cheese and sauerkraut than just the meat.  If they don't have rye, at least ask for your bread to be toasted. I had the onion bun toasted - damn good too.  The fires were OK. Above average, but nothing to make me go \"woah.\"  Oh - and their version of a side salad is a full plate. It's pretty large."}
{"text":"Nice waitress, took a bit long on an empty Monday, but with 20% off for a check in, I'm not complaining too much! The corned beef was fine...mediocre. Really wasn't nearly as tasty as i would have expected...kinda just like hunks of meat on bread. Now, it lasted me for 2 meals, so I'm not complaining. Waitress was nice enough, but she brought me my coffee after I was already done with my meal, so the service is definitely a bit slow! If in the area, and still had a check in deal, I'd go. Otherwise, there are about 1 bagillion other places to eat."}
{"text":"Another place I walked by for years without trying. If your in the Financial or Entertainment area and craving a deli sandwich, this is a good choice.   I will say it up front - don't expect top notch Montreal or New York smoke meat, you will be disappointed. The smoke meat is still pretty good and a decent substitute if your not in Montreal / New York.   The restaurant looks more like a sports bar with lots of TV's and a large bar area, not your traditional deli. Service was excellent on my visit - fast and friendly, just the way I like it.  They do the deli sides incredibly well. The large juicy pickles were perfect (watch the spray when you bite it), amazing coleslaw (if you like it slightly vinegary) and kick ass potato salad (not to much mayo, lot's of potatoes and great dill flavour).     The sandwiches are huge and include Smoked meat, Corned beef, roast beef, Ham, Turkey and a traditional Reuban. Sandwiches come with 7, 10 or 14 oz of meat and served on extra thick rye bread (three types). The 7 oz should be good for most appetites.  I tried the smoke meat sandwich. The meat still had some good spice & smoked flavour but the texture is more like the standard variety sold in a grocery store (as noted by a few other yelpers).  I sampled the Turkey and Roast Beef as well and they were pretty good. I think I will get the Turkey next time. Meats are all lean which is the way I like them (I also get Schwartz smoke meat lean).   The poutine was surprisingly good and they use chicken / turkey gravy as opposed to the traditional dark gravy. Warning, it's a large portion - 3 of us shared.     I will be back for sure - great service, cool decor, good sandwiches and amazing sides.  PS - they have a Man vs. Food type challenge. If you can eat a 40 oz smoke meat sandwich and pickle in one hour - it's free. If you fail, the sandwich is $30."}
{"text":"3.5 stars?  I tried the smoked meat and the corned beef sandwiches.  Both were decently portioned and the meats had distinct flavours.  Not quite Schwartz's in Mtl, but still good.  I liked the fries."}
{"text":"Probably the best smoked meat west of Montreal."}
{"text":"This place is top notch, exactly what you expect you get here. Great corned beef or montreal smoked meat (my preferences for sure) and definitely the bigger the better for me. And to top it off, great pickles to go along with it as well. I cant say anything else about this place other than it is great value for either lunch or dinner and you wont be disappointed. Definitely give it a shot if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I'm originally from Montreal and have lived here for over 17 years and kind of a Smoked Meat Hound as I have done almost every Smoked Meat place around the GTA.  Dropped into this place today after trying to go last week in the  TO location. This was off of Weston Road and Hwy 7 in an industrial area.  The place was really nice for a smoke meat house. Great service and the Montreal Smoked Meat sandwich I ordered was good. I had asked for Medium which usually has a little more fat in it and juicier. This one was a little dry for my liking. The ff were great as well as the Cole Slaw and Pickle as I ordered the platter.  So where does this place stack up to all the others. I would say Middle of The Pack.  If anyone cares, here are my Favorites in order:  1.Pete's On Eglinton (West of Dixie on Eglington, Missisauga).  2. MD Montreal Deli (York Blvd) North York (sister location at Dundas west of hwy 427, not as good) 3.Moe Pancers on Bathurst  4.Centre Street Deli (Centre Street, east of dufferin) * this one goes up and down the list through the years. 5.Wolfies Sheppard west of Bathurst 6.Corned Beef House (Weston & hwy 7) the others dont need mention and some were just awful and never went back. Maybe you have a favorite that i havent been to?"}
{"text":"it was definitely good; we had the Montreal Smoked Meat huge platter and upgraded our fries to a poutine. I was expecting the serving size to be a bit bigger, but the Montreal Smoked Meat was amazing. Oh - the poutine here is amazing; the gravy leaves a little something to be desired (not beefy tasting enough) but THOSE CHEESE CURDS - were absolutely squeaky! Overall, a little bit expensive for what you're getting, but solid food."}
{"text":"Fantastic smoked meat sandwich!  Thick sliced light eye bread perfect match for unbelievably tender smoked meat. Side of Cole slaw was also perfect.  Friendly service."}
{"text":"Decent corned beef sandwich here and friendly waitstaff. Fries were actually great too!"}
{"text":"Shocking how empty this little gem is.   In the heart of the entertainment district, this spot remains virtually empty just before a Blue Jays game. We arrived early expecting a crowd, so it was a complete surprise when we were able to pick any table in the house. Hey Toronto, if you're looking for a sandwich before the game, I recommend giving this place a try, just across the street from Hooters and the Cineplex.  We enjoyed our first time at Corned Beef House (CBH as they call it).  As someone who has eaten corned beef and smoked meat for many years, I can say with some level of authority that this place has it going on, if it's deli meat you're after.  Our server was Brittany, and she was delightful. A little quick to want to clear our table, but hey, that's just initiative, right? Anyway, she tends the bar in her spare time.  We had the corned beef and smoked meat - 10oz sandwiches. Don't let the names fool you, and don't get anything smaller than the 10oz, that's what we had, and while it was just enough, we probably could have gone bigger.   Both meats were excellent, living up to Montreal or New York City standards. The rye, while it kept together until the last bite, was a bit thick, and I prefer mine with caraway. But nonetheless, it was fresh, and the meat was outstanding.  We had platters, so the usual suspects came along for the ride: fries, coleslaw, dill pickle. Frankly, I wasn't expecting a dill, and it was great. The coleslaw - standard fare - and posed no surprises, and the fries were nice and crispy, just the way I like them.   Had dinner with a bottle of Boylan's cream soda - just the way deli was meant to be enjoyed!   P.S. If you don't like mustard, be sure to tell them or it's coming on the bread. Brittany asked us in advance, phew :)  P.P.S. The notes on the side say \"beer and wine only\", but they do have a full bar."}
{"text":"Nothing too special. Was a little disappointed because of the high reviews here. Around $12 after tax for decent montreal smoked sandwich and potato salad.  The service wasn't great because there were so many people to one waitress/waiter. Had to wait a while for the food and to get the bill."}
{"text":"Corned Beef House is like a two block walk from the office in Toronto.  That and the fact that their sandwiches are so good means that I eat there relatively often when in town.    I've tried the corned beef and the montreal smoked meat, both of which are great.  I've also been with friends who have tried the turkey and had good things to say about that as well.  You've essentially got 6 choices for meat fillings for your sandwich, then you choose from 5 bread choices and multiple types of mustard.  Sandwiches come in 3 sizes, Huge, Gigantic and Collosal.  With 7 oz of meat the huge is usually enough for me, especially given the 9.99 special for a huge sandwich and a beer! :)  Yeah, my typical order is the special: huge smoked meat on marbled rye, extra spicy mustard with an amsterdam blonde.  maybe a side of potato salad if I'm feeling extra hungry (the potato salad is good)"}
{"text":"Delicious large portion sandwiches.  I tried to be a gangster and eat my wifes half sandwich too.  I regret it after.. But not when I did it."}
{"text":"I called in my order at 12:25, was told it would take 20 minutes before I could pick it up. Got there at 12:35, waited till 1:25, still no order. I was told, they didn't actually right down my order so I just stood there waiting even though the waitress knew, because I told her, that I had called in advance. Terrible, terrible, terrible. The place is busy but this is beyond unacceptable for a sandwich. After an hour waiting, the waitress took my order again (third time). I would have walked out a while ago but I already paid for my order when I arrived. I was offered drinks as an apology but really, I just wanted my lunch."}
{"text":"Great location and service, but NOT the best corned beef in town, in my opinion.   A friend and I came here to enjoy a groupon I bought a while back. We were both really impressed with the atmosphere and decor of the place. It was very modern, but comfy. There was one guy running the show, pouring drinks, taking orders, bringing out food, and he did a great job. He seemed relaxed and was really nice.   We ordered a pitcher of beer and the corned beef and roast beef brisket plates, with potato salad and french fries. I love the fries. They were perfectly crispy and just fantastic. We got a side of gravy to go with them. It was a very good choice. I found the sandwiches were fine, but not great. I've been hitting a Jewish deli uptown for a while and found it hard not to compare the two. The meat from the Corned Beef house was lean, salty (not overly so) and had the texture closer to grocery store deli meat. My friend pointed out the problem: the meat was LEAN. It was still juicy and flavourful, but I was missing the veins of fat that I've become accustomed to. It was also not shaved paper thin, which is also how I prefer it.   It was a great place to hang out... great atmosphere and service, and awesome fries, but I'm afraid I'll be staying uptown for my deli sandwich fix."}
{"text":"This was hands down one of the best poutines I've ever had. What makes it so great was the gravy , it tasted like they use the drippings from the meat they cook. The fries where cooked perfectly and the cheese was perfect as well. I even saved half for a midnight snack and it was still good. Definitely recommend this spot."}
{"text":"Delicious Montreal smoked meat sandwich! Good coleslaw and pickle. Potato salad was good. The beef stew soup tasted home-made and the broth was great! Overall, I loved everything, excellent place to eat if you're craving a delicious meat-filled sandwich!"}
{"text":"I thought I missed Swartz in Montreal but not anymore. No place can take over Swartz but this place comes in very close second in my books. The new location is very nice.  Delicious! Come in and seat yourself at a empty table anywhere. I had the Reuben sandwich which is huge as stated in the menu. I don't know what the fork and knife was there for but it was tasty and messy - no other way to eat it. They've finally switched their fries from baked to fried. Nice."}
{"text":"The Montreal deli meat sandwich was nothing like the sandwiches you get in Montreal from any of the established delis there.    As one reviewer already put it, it's very similar to what you'd get from an Arby's sandwich - only better, but not far different.  Truly a disappointing experience - especially considering the prices of these sandwiches.  I guess I'll have to drive all the way to Centre Street Deli up in Vaughan to get a taste of true Montreal deli meat."}
{"text":"5/5 for a good reason.  They don't do much, but anything they do, they do really WELL.  I suppose it's to be expected, since they've been around forever.  So corned beef?  Best you've had.  Coleslaw?  Great balance of health and taste.  Pickles?  Good choice.  Club?  Great mix of flavors.  Reuben?  Wonderful.  Let me give you a story of this place to give you some character.  I go here regularly with a group of friends.  We used to go every night that was also  pie night at Canteen just around the corner.  So we'd do Corned Beef house and then Canteen for pie.  Canteen pies were pretentious, style-wise and modest, amount-wise, but decent in taste.  I don't want my desserts to simply taste \"decent.\"  Some nights they didn't have pie.  The guy who works at Corned Beef House, \"Germaine\" (I call him Jerome for some reason), who's a laid back bartender/waiter there, he would always suggest that I try their Apple Pie.  We never did.  Finally, pie nights ended at Canteen or we got sick of the savoury pies they always ended up having on \"pie night.\"  So we gave Corned Beef House a shot.  Their pies were amazing.  With ice cream?  Just a picture-perfect and wonderfully tasting pie.  We wondered why we wasted our time so much trying out the Canteen pies.  So we kept having the Corned Beef House Pies.  Eventually, Jerome suggested we tried their cheesecakes.  He told us they were good.  As per tradition, we ignored his suggestions until the day that they had run out of pie (they tend to do that, so make sure if you come late that you order the pie with your food).  So we were forced to have the Cheesecake.  Lo and behold, just as good as the pie, which is to say VERY good.    Same process repeated with the biscotti.  Jerome suggested, we ignored, finally he actually just gave us samples.    Pie, Cheesecake, Biscotti, limited flavors but some of the best you`ll get.  I wholeheartedly recommend this place.  Tell Germaine that Zaid sent you.  And call him Jerome.  Doesn`t matter, the food will taste just as good."}
{"text":"Food is good  Service is slow as stone  Sandwich place should be quick in and out. It's frustrating for wait 30min for couple of takeout sandwiches"}
{"text":"We wandered in to this place, really so that we could get out of the cold lol.  The service was friendly, and the food was fantastic.  What really stood out were the oven cooked (not fried) french fries.  The sandwich was very good too, but those fries stick out in my mind."}
{"text":"Corned beef on rye (with a pickle). As promised.  It's easy to miss on your walk along Adelaide. Hooters, Office Bar, and Pizzaiolo are all competing for your attention at Adelaide and John with high contrast signage. Corned Beef House sits with its frosted glass doors recessed into unadorned brick. When you do see it, you assume it must be a tiny little place.  Walking in is revelatory though. A few steps of walk up to a bright and open dining room with a few tables and some bar seating as well. Friendly staff, simple menu.   \"I'm torn. Do I want a corned beef sandwich, or smoked meat?\"  \"Tough choice, they're both great. But go with the Corned Beef, it'll have you coming back for the smoked meat.\"  \"Sold.\"  \"Great. How hot do you want your mustard?\"   My \"huge\" (by their sizing, the smallest of the offerings) sandwich on Marble Rye (hot mustard) came out quickly and paper bagged for take out, with a separately wrapped pickle. I picked up a Boylan's soda as well, tried not to feel pompous in the process.  Their slaw (the vinegar kind, not creamy) probably came out of a bucket, but it was tasty and let me believe I'd eaten a vegetable. The sandwich itself was great - stacked high, good flavour. I could have taken more mustard, but I'm sort of a strange fellow when it comes to mustard.  All in all, a solid sandwich joint with a nicer inside than you'd expect. Prices are a bit high for a takeout sandwich, but not so as to keep me away.  Pro-tip: as pasta wants sauce, deli meat wants mustard. Take it from a strange mustard fellow. Choose carefully, they have at least 5 or 6 options.  Also: don't bring a big group. 4's fine, particularly since sandwiches take up relatively little space, but I think larger groups would have trouble here. Call ahead, at the very least."}
{"text":"I have been reading these reviews, and honestly, I am frankly shocked at the happy reviews of this place.  I am wondering if this is one of those joke review sites that are the opposite.  And it was not cheap for really fatty (and I mean fatty for corned beef, not fatty like I don't know corned beef can be fatty) tasteless meat.  My family is a foodie casual group, a la \"diners, drive ins and dives\" and are not food snobs, but this is the worst corned beef we have had next to Pickles in AC, NJ.  The service speed was pleasant and ok, and the bread was ok for middlin' rye, but the corned beef, ordered lean was the fattiest most foul, yucky meat and did not look or taste like a good corned beef sandwich at all.  If you are used to a good deli corned beef sandwich you will NOT enjoy this place.  My hubby almost vomited from this.  Seriously."}
{"text":"Ate here once, a while ago, and really loved it.  I need more (single) friends who are into this sort of food.  Drop me a note if you are in the same boat!  Knowing me, I probably got the Reuben.  Whatever I had, it was great.  I do distinctly remember that they had \"old timey pops\"--it was lunch and I was at work so getting a beer was not really an option.    Actually, now that I think about it, I have been here twice--once in the old location, about a block west and on the south side of the street.  The new place is certainly more upscale although the older location had its charm.  If you are into big, meaty sandwiches, this is a wonderful place to get one.  You won't be disappointed--or hungry, probably for the rest of the day!  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place is always awesome! Great food and atmosphere for the price. If you like giant sandwiches filled with meat, you need to check this place out."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday night for dinner. The place was deserted. Hmmm. Good French fries, pretty good corn beef, you can order what size sandwich you want. Gravy on poutine was gross, tasted like it came out of can. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Loved it!  I got the huge Montreal smoked meat with poutine.  Overall, the service was excellent and the food was great as well.  The huge is a bit much and difficult to eat so I recommend a smaller or get a plate instead."}
{"text":"The corned beef is delicious, that's for sure. It's moist, not too salty, and served in portions large enough to feed you AND your evil twin. The poutine, on the other hand, is rather meh. Granted, I only had the plain (non-beefy) version, and I'd say it's skippable -- the gravy is bland, and the fries just get overly soggy underneath the weight of the gravy. I've had much better poutine elsewhere.   The service, on the other hand, is not so great. The server was so saccharine and her tone was so forced that you could tell she didn't want to be there -- it was so bad that it made the meal a bit uncomfortable to begin with, and then went downhill from there as there were a few miscommunications that left our experience there rather sour.   So... yeah. I'd come back, but grab my sandwich to go."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick dinner on a week day before grabbing a movie at the Scotia Bank Theatre which is just up the street. This is a nice little restaurant with a cozy retro decor that is instantly comfortable. There were only a couple other diners at the pre-dinner hour which meant quick service and nice quiet environment.   The food were nicely done and was quite reasonable at an affordable price. We had a Montreal Smoked Meat sandwich ($8.75 medium), which has several bread and meat cut options and comes with a whole pickle. We also had a side of Poutine ($4.99) which was just plain gravy over cheese curds and fries, but well done.  Overall a hidden gem for a quick diner meal. Would definitely consider coming back when in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Come here everytime for a special occasion. Gives my boyfriend a reason to come back. So much yummy meat.  The desserts are also amazing!!! Big portions too :)"}
{"text":"Visiting Toronto and looking for a Reuben. Found one. You have seen the pictures. Yes, the sandwiches are monstrously packed. Even the smallest option, \"huge\", was, well HUGE. Service was great, atmosphere was cheery and prices reasonable."}
{"text":"Excellent roast beef brisket sandwich - the meat was perfectly seasoned and so flavorable. U must order their fries - perfectly crispy outside and soft inside."}
{"text":"Wonderful! Probably the best corned beef sandwich I've had since college. Outstanding. Wish I had found the place earlier in my trip, will be back on my next visit to Toronto."}
{"text":"\"Section 74.05 of the Competition Act is a civil provision. It prohibits the sale or rent of a product at a price higher than its advertised price.\"  The Corned Beef house was hands down the worst dining experience I've ever had. A few buddies and I went to the corned beef house and attempted the challenge- if you dont complete it, both the website and the signs in the building say the sandwich is 29.95. The waitress tried to tell us that its actually 3995- to which we said, hey, the advertised price is 29.95, thats how much we have to pay. She then tried to charge me the 3995, to which I repeated that they must honor the advertised price. At this point, the chef came out yelling profanities- he called me a \"fucking snake\" and told me both that he didnt care about the extra $10 and then to shove the $10 up my ass. He yelled at me for about 5 minutes in front of both my friends and other patrons, screaming insults and profanities.  I will never go here again, ever. I cant believe I was called a thief and a snake as a paying customer that merely asked for Corned Beef House to honor their advertised pricing. I cannot support any business that will engage in both underhanded behaviour to avoid honoring their prices and then will abuse paying customers. I will be posting this review in as many forums as I can- people need to know about this experience. Are the people running this business aware that their employees are acting in this fashion to customers- previously I was happy with my meal and the quality of the food, and would have returned. I would like an apology for the service I have received and I think you would do well to rid yourselves of such an abusive employee.   Please avoid at all costs as a consumer and take your business to restaurants that value their customers and will honor their legal obligations."}
{"text":"If aren't looking specifically at this place and looking for the entrance, you'll likely miss it.  There isn't a large garish sign, or entrance to this place.    I'm very happy that I didn't miss it.  Had pre-ordered to do take-out order as I wasn't in the mood to sit in a place.  Arrived around 8p on a Monday and found that there was only one other table that had patrons.  When I arrived, the cook indicated that they were out of rye bread to make my sandwich and offered up a kaiser bun as an alternative.  Rye would have been ideal, but I'm not going to cry over the kaiser.  There was only one server in the place and the cook.  Both were very friendly and talkative.  Got the Corned Beef sandwich and because I felt like it... the poutine as well !  Got back to the hotel and unwrapped my piping hot food !  The Corned Beef was good (I've had better) but this is still a solid Corned Beef Sandwich.  The Poutine was again... good, I've had better, but still good.  Overall, I like this little place with solid food and friendly staff.  Yup, comfort food is good !"}
{"text":"This place seemed like a local hotspot. Not too busy on a Saturday night after a blue jays game (tourists piled into the hooters across the street), but some regulars were there. Be prepared for a mountain of food. 3 of my group had their \"huge\" sandwiches and a side of fries and none of us could get close to finishing our meal. Very reasonable prices though especially for the amount of food given. Would definitely come here again (after I recover from my food coma)."}
{"text":"I think these guys have successfully converted me in to liking beef!! We came for lunch on Friday. When we arrived the restaurant was already pretty packed. We were lucky to get a table for 6 at noon!!  We were seated promptly and handed the menu. Everything sounded really good on the menu.   We started off with two platters of complimentary fries! I guess they knew that it would take time to make our sandwiches and I really appreciate that they didn't leave us starving. The fries were delish!! They were freshly made as could tell from their temperature! The seasoning was also perfect. They were a bit on the greasier side but come on this is a diner after all!!  We all ordered platters which came with coleslaw (without mayo), a choice of potato salad or fries, a dill pickle and the sandwich itself (which was huge!!). They let you choose the bread and the mustard.  Montreal smoked meat with light rye bread - We had this with Dijon mustard. The meat was smoked to perfection. It had the right amount of fat to keep everything moist. I couldn't stop eating it.  Beef brisket sandwich with onion kaiser - I loved the bread. The roast beef was cut really well (thinnest slices I have seen).  The Dijon mustard again added a big kick to a usually boring roast beef.   The service was great throughout. I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I had my first corned beef sandwich here at least 5 years ago while I was burning time before an interview- I had another sandwich afterwards(cuz the guy was super cute). I didn't get the interview, but fell in love with corned beef & deli sandwich in general and  I spent last few years trying to go back here.  Unfortunately for me, I have no sense of direction - but this inspire me to write the address down when I saw it in passing, so I may be able to look it up. Oh no, I trusted my abnormally short memory to remember where it was.  Because I couldn't remember where it was, I couldn't even suggest it when my friends and I were trying to figure out what to eat. Then one day, I swear to everything that's holy - it disappeared from where it stood -and I thought I lost it finally.  But then I've been seeing a restaurant bearing the same name - I've been telling myself months now that I must find out if it was the same. Today , a perfect opportunity presented itself and I magically remembered to suggest it. It was totally meant to be - all the signs were there - and it proved to be the same love at first bite.  When I told the incredibly friendly server my search for this place, he  explained to me that  I wasn't crazy - they had actually moved only a couple of years ago - and crushed my hopes of living off social funding like so many capable people do.  I like the new place  too. The old place was small and dark wooded - but it fit the overall theme of the place and the food was just so good I didn't care about the size of the place - I'd eat it anywhere. The new space was modern and sleek. I love the \"menu board\" and the food was still so delicious( I am salivating as I am writing this) - with the freshest slice of pickle...and even during these \"hard times\" they give you your money's worth. The sizes range from Huge to enormous(?) and they aren't not kidding. They don't give  you bunch of tiny old pickles either - they give you a huge hunk of a pickle, that will last you the whole sandwich.  Their homemade cheesecake? I dunno. it's homemade - and the only thing that beats a homemade cake sold in a restaurant? is the homemade cake mama/spouse makes you with love - It's just the way cheesecake was meant to be.  I almost resent going in there today because now I'm going to have to fight to stay out of it....but if you've never enjoyed a good deli sandwich - this place will change your mind, at the first bite."}
{"text":"This was undoubtedly the best Reuben sandwich I've ever eaten....and the smoked meat was awesome as well. My wife and I have explored the deli world in Toronto pretty thoroughly ie Yitz's, Centre Street, Caplansky etc and this is our favorite. Portions and value are amazing! The atmosphere is charming and neighborly. Jermaine, your host is sure to please with his warm, welcoming hospitality. Rob in the kitchen looks very serious as he goes about delivering expertise to every component of our platter. It is obvious he takes great pride in his restaurant!  There restaurant slogan is \"Toronto's Best Kept Secret \" and this restaurant should not be a secret..... it's far too good!"}
{"text":"A little crowded at lunch (obviously), but excellent waitressing, a monster sandwich, and a great selection of beer make the wait worthwhile."}
{"text":"My gf and I did not know what to do on a frigid cold Saturday.  She told me that she had a group on for Corned Beef House.... so off we went.   Immediately when we walked in there was this laid back, friendly kinda vibe.  With Sam Cooke and the James Brown playing in the background,  we enjoyed a large Smoked Reuben Sandwich and their Mochas (which totally hit the spot).    This place is classic, unpretentious and just plain badass.  Love the decor, Great food, Great service, and Amazing Reubens."}
{"text":"Been coming here for the past 5 years! Jermaine the manager is always a welcome face there. Great service and the Rueben sandwich is downright ambrosia!"}
{"text":"Wanted a quick eat before watching as show and dropped by this place.  Staff: Seat yourself when you walk in. It was a quiet Tuesday and there was only one server. Everyone was good and the food came pretty quick.  Ambience: When you enter it is up a flight of stairs. Modern facility with sports playing behind the bar. It was nice, but nothing unique.  Food: The Montreal Smoked Meat Sandwich with Honey Mustard was perfection! The portions were huge and I ended up eating with a knife and fork like a dork, so that I wouldn't cause a huge mess. I also had a Caesar Salad on the side and that was a very hefty plate as well. I wish the salad was a little more dressed up since it was quite generic.  Will return!"}
{"text":"It is definitely the best Montreal smoke meat I have ever had in Toronto. And the service is wonderful. However, there were only 2 customers including me at that time. I have not experienced a busy time there, so don't really know if the service would be good during lunch hours. But the sandwich is great though. Just a little bit too salty for my taste, so I would probably try roast beef sandwich which is a little bit less salty as the waitress suggested next time."}
{"text":"im full.... way too full.... we just crushed 3 GIANT sandwiches, the brisket, turkey and montreal smoked meat... the Brisket was hands down the best deli sandwich ive had in Toronto... the mtl smoked meat was great too! the turkey was kinda blah.... just regular turkey loaf sliced up and stacked high but it aint anything you couldn't get at home... but trust me you wanna go and get a brisket sandwich asap! and then maybe a couch...."}
{"text":"Corned beef was fantastic! The bread was the perfect consistency to compliment the beef. Great customer service too. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"It was good but nothing to write home too. Bread was a little thick and not toasted enough for my liking but meat was delicious"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Not a bad place for a casual lunch. Nice, casual place to sit down inside, but the menu choices are limited outside of corned beef and smoked meat (note for anyone with dietary restrictions or traveling with kids). It's not a kid-oriented place at all, but the waitress was definitely polite enough to us, and we had a comfortable area to sit in. I thought the montreal smoked meat sandwiches and poutine were just okay for me. Would not make a special trip to go here, but would stop by if in the area."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped here for lunch on our last day in Toronto. The best way to describe this place is high end deli. The menu consisted mainly of sandwiches. My friend ordered the Reuben and absolutely loved it. Mine however, left me a little disappointed, not because of the taste mind you but the presentation. I ordered the colossal turkey, and what I got was 16oz of deli style turkey meat playfully stacked between regular sized sandwich bread. They should have used a hero sized bun or something similar in sized as I was forced to eat my \"sandwich\"  with a fork and knife. This is why I didn't give the Resturant five stars, but, everything else was so amazing I couldn't bare to give them anything less then four stars."}
{"text":"So yes, I've been to Schwartz's in Montréal, but I can't say this place was terrible by comparison. Not a bit. The seating is far more comfortable and I really don't care about \"authenticity\"...like I've said before, \"real\" and \"authentic\" lose their appeal quickly when you're talking about fruit cake, steam-powered transit, and 19th-Century public sanitation. Believe it or not, sometimes things improve with a little tweaking.  Anyhow, this place is really good if you want a massive wad of salted meat between two pieces of decent bread. I liked the salad too. I know it's not fashionable to like iceberg lettuce but the crunch always gets me. I thought the server was pretty good too, but the huge meat wad is definitely the main attraction.  The bathrooms were clean and very brightly lit."}
{"text":"Great spot!  The owner is a very cool, friendly guy.  The beef barley soup is salty but overflowing with chunky, meaty goodness.  The smoked meat is fantastic, the reuben sandwichs are perfect.  I'm not sure the restaurant's NAME is all that attractive, but the food is filling and fine."}
{"text":"Since my hubby is a huge fan of smoked meat sandwiches, we went to this place. We liked their retro ambiance. We ordered Roast beef sandwich platter (gigantic) and shared. My hubby liked their coleslaw which he ended up not sharing with me, and he was really impressed by their fries which I thought ordinary. I really enjoyed it, too but nothing was extraordinary about it. At last, their gigantic Roast beef sandwich was good. Gigantic sandwiches contains 10oz. of meat, so it is really big. I don't think neither of us can finish it alone, but we don't have big stomachs either. For most of women, \"huge\" is probably enough to make them feel full. For men, they can try \"gigantic\", it will satisfy your appetite. The flavor is ok, a bit salty to me however my husband seemed pretty happy about it. We may return sometimes when we are in the area with empty stomachs."}
{"text":"Gord and I had lunch this afternoon at the Corned Beef House ... it's our favourite place for corned beef and Montreal smoked meat sandwiches.  We were hungry so got a gigantic corned beef sandwich and a gigantic Montreal smoked meat sandwich on light rye ... as usual, we had half of each.  And as usual, they were delicious!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a late lunch at 3:30pm and were the only people for sit-down service.  Ordered two \"gigantic\" sandwiches (i.e. Roasted Beef and Montreal Smoked Beef) and with a side of poutine.  Filling but not overly stuffed and induced to a food coma.  Free (decent) coffee.  Free wifi.  20% off with Yelp check-in!"}
{"text":"You would miss this place on Adelaide if you didn't stop and look for it. Really good smoked meat. I loved the hot mustard served here. Only weird thing was hot sauerkraut. Who serves their sauerkraut hot?? The fries are very good.   I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on Monday with a friend.... Seated quickly.... waitress made herself visible quickly.... brought menus and waters pdq.... friend ordered 10 oz corned beef sandwich and soup of the day, cream of mushroom,,, i ordered 10 oz mtl smoked meat on dark rye and soup of the day.... both sandwiches come with pickle and choice of mustard.... soup was good.... sandwiches arrived and we got busy devouring... friend was disappointed with corned beef.... i sampled as well and found it lacking depth of flavour, almost like it was sitting in hot water and not a brine... mtl smoked meat was good, but just...."}
{"text":"For me, the corned beef house has the best Deli sandwiches I have tried.  I usually go with the wife and we both order a sandwich each and split a poutine.  I have tried the Montreal Smoked Meat, Roast Beef, and Corned Beef.  I haven't heard good things about the turkey so I haven't bothered with that one, at least not yet.  All come in 3 sizes:  Huge (7oz), Gigantic (10oz) and if you are feeling extra hungry, go for the Colossal (16oz).  They even do a \"Man vs. Sandwich\" challenge every Monday, where if you can conquer a 40 oz sandwich (Bread, meat and pickle) in an hour, its free.  Otherwise its $29.95.  The meat on ones that I have tried is always very juicy, never dry.  The buns/bread are always fresh and the pickles on the side are among the best I've had.  I always take a few pickles home.  You also get your choice of mustard, ranging from mild to spicy, dijon, or regular yelow mustard.  The fries and gravy that is included on the poutine are great.  Crisp hot fries and a tasty gravy covering melty cheese curds, you can't go wrong there!  I live a good distance from there but try to get there a few times a year if possible.  Its just that good."}
{"text":"Finally, a Reuben I can love!  It's taken me awhile to find a sandwich place for what I call \"old fart\" sandwiches... you know, the ones you generally only see old guys in old movies or in film noir books order.  These are big fat sandwiches, the sides are great (garlicky potato salad FTW).  I had the Reuben platter (coleslaw & potato salad) and my husband had the Brisket.  They were absolutely great.  The meat was tasty, and as a once in awhile salt splurge, this was really satisfying. =)  Next time, I'm going to try the soup too.  And some fries.  The staff were nice, it's easy to find, and the atmosphere is nice and light.  Definitely worth some return visits.  You won't be sorry you went, ya old fart!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the Montreal smoked meat sandwich platter here. It was huge! By the time I was done I could barely move. The sandwich was stuffed with smoked meat that was juicy, not overly salty, and very tasty. The fries were crispy and just the way I like them. The coleslaw was saucy, creamy, and tasty. The pickle on the side added a nice touch, but wasn't crunchy like I prefer.  Either way, I was impressed. I'll be back soon enough."}
{"text":"A bunch of my colleagues and I came last night for dinner and I must say that we were NOT disappointed.   We ordered their corned beef sandwich, smoked meat sandwich, roast beef brisket sandwich and smoked meats poutine. All the meats were thinly sliced, and packed with flavours. You can choose between the light rye, marble rye or the onion kaiser, and pair it with different type of mustards. They were all superb, and everything was fresh. The gravy in the poutine was not overly salted and the cheese curds were squeaky fresh - two thumbs up!  I will be back very soon :D"}
{"text":"Under the radar deli that doesn't get the hype like another deli in the city which serves hideous food with outrageous prices and minuscule portions (Caplansky's). This place has the best corned beef in the city hands down! You have the option to choose from 4 different sizes. The bread is always fresh and the sides are solid. Now that CBH is available via UberEATS, I can't resist ordering a couple times a week!"}
{"text":"Maybe not my type of food but I feel it was very well delivered by attentive waitresses. Nice atmosphere as well. A side note, the portions are quite big, we ordered the smallest (huge) and it was more than enough for a lunch. Recommend a visit to try this culinary experience if you haven't before."}
{"text":"My wife's pregnant and this is one of the spots she craves every few weeks... Even the small sandwich is more than enough for me but that may be because I like to save room for sides. The potato salad is garlicy and delicious I also like to start with a Greek salad but it's just OK. I wish they had more craft beer but that's really the only thing I'd change if I had too.   If you still have room try, the pie with ice-cream on top. Like everything else it's a larger portion."}
{"text":"I'm mad I haven't been eating here since the day I moved to Toronto. I went after work with my friend today who highly recommended it. The bartender was super helpful and friendly, he even read the menu for me cuz I'm too cool for my glasses (I think his name was Jermaine). I got the roast beef on light rye with hot and honey mustard (loved the multiple options on bread and mustards) and a side of potato salad to go. The sandwich was massive (I got the smallest size) and absolutely delicious. The potato salad was just like my grandma made me when I was a kid, I wish I had gotten a second side! They also put a pickle in a small zip lock bag. It was so cute! I'll definitely be coming back, probably in the next few days."}
{"text":"Let me say this review is based on my personal tastes and if you don't agree then discard it. So I have heard great things about this place. I was excited to try it. I prefer New York corned beef or even some Montreal smoked meats. This was not that. I got the huge corned beef with regular rye bread. The meat is sliced extremely thin and stacked on the sandwich. It's a good amount of meat and not too overwhelming. But it's like a better version of Arby's. Sort of that consistency. The flavor was fine but it tasted more like a ham sandwich than rich flavorful corned beef. They slather it with plan old mustard. Not exciting deli mustard. So overall felt meh about it. Not for me."}
{"text":"Uggghhhhh. The smoked meat sandwich lives up to the hype."}
{"text":"I wound up here because I was given the nigh-impossible task of fielding a dinner for a group of 40, on a Friday, in the entertainment district, on a budget of $25 a head including tax and tip.  Which is practically impossible; even a throwaway like Gretzky's or Jack Astor's is going to run past that budget, and it's Toronto, so virtually nobody takes reservations nor can they seat such a massive group.  And lo, Corned Beef House somehow fit the bill, despite being a far better option than something painfully average that would've cost even more.  I was elated to not have to subject my party to a TGI Friday's or Milestones or something.  Holy hell.  While CBH doesn't normally take reservations, a couple painless phone calls saw them being extremely helpful in accommodating my party, even going so far as to offer to stay open past their usual hours to fit our needs.  The dinner was a success, the service was wonderful, my group of picky eaters were all pleased, and everybody went home happy.  Awesome.  Before committing to the booking I snuck in solo to try the place out, stopping in for lunch.  I tried the Corned Beef Platter, which is a \"Huge\" Corned Beef sandwich (that's 7 ounces of meat), potato salad, slaw, and a pickle.  I also ordered a side of poutine.  The sandwich was quite large, and the meat was tender and fairly moist.  It wasn't quite as good as Katz's up by Yorkdale, but it was by all accounts a good corned beef sandwich.  The potato salad and the slaw were both very solid, and I'd gladly order both again.  The poutine was MASSIVE, and surprisingly good - the fries are well prepared and not too greasy; the gravy's light and flavourful; and the cheese curds are plentiful and have just a little squeak to them.  There's alot of value here.  When I returned with the group for dinner I had the larger \"Gigantic\" sandwich, clocking in at 10 ounces and photographed below next to a penny below for sake of scale.  I guess because I grew up on eBay or something.  Some members of my party ordered the \"Colossal\" at 16 ounces, and were awe-stricken by the sheer size of their order.  I don't know if anyone managed to finish it; one diner dropped half of his Colossal turkey breast sandwich on the floor, and still left full.  Someone ordered a dinner salad and was delivered a garden.  There were \"slices\" of pie ordered for dessert, and my friends received what appeared to be a quarter of a giant, threateningly large pie.  The kind of pie that if encountered in an alley, would beat you up and take your wallet.  You may notice that out of the 60+ pictures for this restaurant on Yelp, not a single photo of pie exists.  That's because everyone who's ever tried to eat a slice of pie here has perished in the attempt, frozen in a rigor mortis of their own gluttony, left to remain where they fell like a dead mountaineer climbing Everest.  This place is awesome.  The food's very good, the location's prime, and it's dirt cheap since everything's enormous.  On top of all that the service is warm and attentive without being intrusive, and they really bent over backwards for my group."}
{"text":"This place is on my regular lunch circuit rotation despite the somewhat long walk from bay street (relatively speaking that is) - definitely go with the smallest size on your first going - the portions are ridiculously big and probably no need for a side of french fries - first few times I ordered fries and only ate a few until I learned - you go there for the meat!!! A true meat market in that sense!"}
{"text":"O M G....SERIOUSLY!!  The best deli I've ever had!!  Seriously!  Btw, if you don't eat pork, they have turkey and roast beef too!  Where to start.....hmmmmmmm....!  Well, I ordered the Rueben platter, huge size, with Dijon mustard, on rye (next time I'm gonna try an onion roll!) .  All I can say is that if huge is the 2nd of 4 sizes, don't order anything bigger, unless you haven't eaten in a while!  You also get a huge mound of hot, fresh, fries, and a generous portion of vinegar-based coleslaw!  Everything was hot (or cold for coleslaw!), home made and spectacular!!!!  The corned beef, stupendous......!  The fries, I ordered gravy, the gravy amazing, and good amount!  The cole slaw was phenomenal.....vinegar-based is NOT normally a favorite for me....but theirs definitely IS!   And.  The prices, especially given the portions, are truly exceptional.... PARTICULARLY for downtown....right?!!  I can NOT recommend them enough!  My only complaints are a) NO desserts....for at least the next week....when they're HOME MADE.....SERIOUSLY??  Please fix it!!  B)  The lack of a handicap push button for the entrance door.  If you have a cane, it's hard to get the door open!  My other issue is the stairs, but, I have managed to tear the meniscus in BOTH of my knees  (yes, APPARENTLY, I'm a perfectionist in EVERYTHING I do!!  I simply can WAIT for surgery!  )  Anyways, you simply MUST check this place out.  Run, don't walk."}
{"text":"I tried to finish my platter. Oh how I tried! I'm just not fat enough. Maybe one day, if I play my cards right, I'll be big enough to tackle this place. If you're a fat American in search of poutine you've found the right place. Poutine for days. And sandwiches so big your cankles will forgive you for the trip."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good deli-style sandwiches north of the border!  Guess you don't have to be in NYC to get good roast beef and corned beef.  Speaking of which, the latter was very good, moist, and the large (7 oz of meat thin-sliced and piled high) sandwich was more than a handful and filling.  Kids had roast beef with gravy open-face sandwiches which were also very good (despite filling up on the reuben, Dad here happily polished off their leftovers! Hey, it's vacation ... ). French fries were fresh-cut with skin, and addictive. Even better when smothered with their rich gravy. A pleasant - and filling - surprise!"}
{"text":"Not a New York deli but still really really good! I got the Reuben and it was delicious... It was simple but done right with quality ingredients.. I got fries on the side and my boyfriend got the potato salad.. They're big portions... The fries were hand cut and super fresh.. Potato salad really simple and not a lot of mayo.. I'll definitely come back and maybe swing by on my way home because they do take out"}
{"text":"Lookit: I've never been to Schwartz's in Montreal. I'm sure their sandwiches are good (possibly even great) but the endless comparisons make this chauvinstic Torontonian crave another Seven Years' War. Is it really chemically impossible to infuse smoke flavour to meat west of Ottawa/Hull?  Anyway, Corned Beef House is an excellent choice for lunch. I visited to test their claim of \"Toronto's Best Kept Secret\" and while it's not quite Mayor Ford's Dungeon of Doom 'n' Gravy[1], I was fairly impressed.  CBH is at the NE corner of John and Adelaide, right across from Hooters. The non-descript façade led me to believe this place was more of a hole-in-the-wall. I was wrong: it's spacious and nicely decorated inside.  Let's talk sammiches. Your options are unhelpfully sized as Huge (7oz), Gigantic (10oz), and Colossal (16oz). They might as well park a Jaguar E-type in here because these names are clearly compensating for something. I reasoned that Huge would be sufficiently monstro, so I got their Corned Beef on Light Rye ($7.45) with a side of Coleslaw ($3.25). You can also choose your type of mustard.  The meat was juicy, flavourful and really tender. The Huge really is a tall pile of meat, so I can't imagine what circumstances would compel me to go larger (mid-life crisis?). It was a winning sandwich, but not the Bestest Ever. But still very good. The sandwiches came with a fat pickle, but I didn't love it. Priced about the same as their peers in the T.O. smoked meat world and they do have an evening deal after 6pm.   I shall return!  Obligatory Title Pun: She's a BEEF HOUSE/She's smoky, smoky, just lettin' it all hang out.  Menu Readability: It comes on a solid tablet. I felt kind of like a Flintstone.  Need to mention: The onion kaiser actually seems like a smarter choice of bread.  What this place teaches me about myself: I probably shouldn't libel the mayor. I'm also really hard on Montreal for some reason.    _____ [1] Fact."}
{"text":"So good. You'll come here hungry and leave so full. My favourite spot for a cornee beef sandwich and a beer in the city. Huge portions and the sides are decently priced as well."}
{"text":"If you're debating between the corn beef and Montreal smoked meat, go for the corn beef.  It's tender, fatty and delicious.  Was pleasantly surprised by how large the poutine was!! They're very generous in how much meat/cheese/gravy they give you."}
{"text":"Wow!  You know you're in for a treat when the menu choices for the sandwiches are Huge, Gigantic, and COLOSSAL!!  I had the Huge Reuben, my wife had the Huge Montreal Smoked Beef and my son the Huge Smoked Breast of Turkey.  My son's reaction after the first bite:  Wow! This is gooood! And half-way through eating his sandwich he said, \"we need to eat here before we leave Toronto!\" (We're tourists).  The Montreal Smoked Beef and the Reuben were both awesome.  You couldn't go wrong with any sandwich.   After our meal we were offered coffee for free.  We couldn't refuse free coffee after feeling so stuffed. And to our surprise our free coffee was much better than many breakfast places we've eaten.  Really good coffee.  Then we tried their homemade cheese cake.(Yes we're such gluttons).  :-) .... Another Wow!  You could tell it was not one of those mass-produced, factory made cheese cakes.  It was perfect with our coffee.  For an unassuming restaurant that looked just like pub/bar/diner, we had a heck of a surprise of an experience.    We definitely will visit Corned Beef House when we visit Toronto again."}
{"text":"Yum! Ordered a corned beef sandwich (huge) and a montreal smoked meat (gigantic) with a side of fries. Portions are orca big. Corned beef sandwich tasted exactly like a corned beef sandwich should, the smoked meat was nothing like Schwartz's in Montreal but it was still pretty tasty for Toronto standards. Wasn't a big fan of the fries, I like mine thin with the skin on but it was still good enough to eat. And I like the fact you can order half a pint of beer while waiting for your take-out :)  Will be eating here again."}
{"text":"We ordered the Montreal smoked deli sandwich and a BLT during lunch. Everything was on point - the bread was perfectly toasted, the ingredients were fresh, and the meat was mouth watering.  There space is pretty small in the restaurant, so make sure to go early if you can! The environment was nice and casual, a cross between a bar and cafe. Also, this may have been a coincidence but 90% of the customers were male for some reason.  The menu is pretty limited, but they're great at what they do!"}
{"text":"Food is good, a bit understaffed for lunch.  I ordered a montreal smoke meat with side of coleslaw and potato salad. Got fries instead of the coleslaw. So I had potatoes and potatoes..  Waitress did not try to correct the mistake."}
{"text":"Grabbed a bite and some beers here with friends when we were all visiting Toronto.  I'm glad we did as the food was tasty and it was all reasonably priced."}
{"text":"This is a cool low key spot with a full bar and great food.   I ordered the \"huge\" Montreal Smoked sandwich and the Wife got a poutine.   The sandwich is served on rye and is a nice size. The meat is lean and has a nice flavor...   The poutine was one of the best poutines we have ever had. The gravy was perfect!   This is definitely a go to sandwich spot in the city. Another winner to add to the list."}
