{"text":"Great food and service. We have stayed at the Westin several time and never have been disappointed."}
{"text":"This restaurant was right around the corner from our room at the Westin, and it was not too bad! The service was always super nice and when they were out of something, they offered if for free the next day. It was an unnecessary, but appreciated gesture.  My favorite item on their menu are the Truffle Fries. Dear lord, they were heavenly. Their sandwiches and salads were good as well, but those fries hold a special place in my heart."}
{"text":"We love love love their pizza! It's so good. Freshly made, nothing is frozen. We have also gotten their turkey club, it's fresh and melts in your mouth. Staff is wonderful and service is great. You can eat inside, outside, or order take out. Great for kids or family's. Or go outside and sit at their bar for a cocktail. Something for everyone. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This restaurant is part of The Westin Villas. I'd imagine you could make your way in here even if you aren't staying at the hotel/resort. It sits on the backside of the lobby near the pools. It would be a great place to people watch or to watch a game with a group on their TVs.   I went here twice during vacation and the thing that prompts this review surprised me! The menu item to order? GREEK SALAD!  That's tough for me because salads are rarely good when you go out somewhere. Opting to make my perfect salad at home is always preferable. That wasn't the case with this Greek Salad. It was huge and it's the first salad EVER to fill me up! I never thought I could be so full from eating a salad!   This salad is on the pricier side at $11 but it's well worth it. Not only is it huge but you get a fair amount of everything included in the salad. There are plenty of tomatoes, lettuce, olives, feta, onion and lemon oregano dressing... oh! Did I mention the lemon oregano dressing?! Nom nom nom. I still can't believe how satisfied I was with this salad and it has been nearly three months since I had it!   If you check Yelp while here and see this place, do yourself a favor and order the Greek Salad even if you get it to go.   Additional notes: -- Short rib sandwich - On the 2nd visit, I ordered the short rib sandwich. It was good but it could've been way better. It made me wish I would've ordered the Greek Salad again.  -- Truffle fries - If you just need a snack, order these."}
{"text":"This is the restaurant on the villas side of the Westin Kierland in Scottsdale. And it is pretty alright.  Prices are a little high, but that is to be expected as a hotel/resort markup. I have got to say the service is great. We had a couple different servers each time we visited and they were friendly and patient. And on our last evening, they were kind enough to turn on a heater for us for a little bit.   The first time we went, we got the truffle fries to share. YOU WANT the truffle fries. If there are more than two of you, you might want to get TWO orders of the truffle fries. For real. They are so dang good! I also got the Greek salad. It was huge! Definitely worth it's price. And super tasty. Lots of tomatoes and olives for topping. The salads have an option of adding a protein, and I wanted the fried calamari to put on top of it. I think they might have messed up and given me the full appetizer of the calamari...it was SO MUCH.  I can't remember what I had on my last visit (except for more truffle fries) but I am sure it was tasty. All of the drinks we tried were delicious! They have a pretty big selection of cocktails, and we were not disappointed by any of them. It is more on the casual end of things, and they will probably be showing whatever sporting event is currently happening at the time on the big screen.  I think you will enjoy yourself here, and if you are staying at the Villas, will probably find your way back here more than once just like we did!"}
