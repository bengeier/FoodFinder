{"text":"Went there 3 times in a month. Very big different between 1st and 3rd time. Order the same dishes but with different taste. Seafood paste with Cream Sauce, very creamy at 1st time but 3rd times was vert salty. Soup also have same problem! Just a new restaurant, control the taste don't make too big different! Otherwise, people won't come again!"}
{"text":"My go to place for hk afternoon tea menu.  It packed by 2:30   so go 10 minutes ealry or go after 4:30 on the weekend.   Today I shared


Pork chop mini buger - with a small portion of fries served hot.     Solid   5/5

Deep friend chicken wings   good but typical. Moist meat and crunchy skin
4/5

Beef tendon and brisk it.     Great broath,  tendor and flowvour meat   
5/5


Malaysia curry beef brisk it  $9.50   off the a la carte menu.    A liitle pricy compared to the discounted tea time prices but   5/5

Hong Kong tea     5/5    solid smoth taste



It is cramped and busy   but if you don't mind it. It is the best deal  in  town . Hence only the 4 stars.   But you can wait an extra 15 minutes if you really want a booth and less people would hover over you or bump into yiur table or chair"}
{"text":"I tried the cheddar cheese baked bolognese, sadly the sauce wasn't fresh. The noodles weren't that soft... 
Although the other dish Tuscany chicken penne with basil marinara sauce. Was alright, again the noodles didn't seem too fresh. But the sauce was zesty and nice. Thankfully there is an afternoon tea menu, so that means soup and a drink will be provided. 
The soup I ordered was vegetable, I felt like I was drinking tomato only. The drink i ordered was lemon tea. Somehow it tasted different. Over all, the portion for the price you pay is worth it. This new restaurant is a competition between new city! (seems like it). But it is doing good for a new business. There is also no dessert listed on the menu. But there is cheesecake offered for 3.99!"}
{"text":"Our company order's take out from here from time to time, this review is based on the food and that ONE time experience with one of my dishes.

-Indonesian Shrimp and Chicken Fried Rice w/Egg - The egg was cooked, I thought it was suppose to be runny like the other HK style cafe's and the rice was blend, would not order in the future

-Baked Chicken steak rice with tomato and cream sauce with cheese - It was average but nothing very wow

-Satay Combo - Very tasty! the Satay is very different from other places, they do claim it's made in house. Combo is very cheap and filling

-Thai Minced Pork and Eggplant Braised E-Fu Noodle - HORRIFIED !!! Order this and my noodles were black !! like moldy black, spots and spots on my noodles! I had to call them and advise of the situation, the lady apologized and told me to leave my name and phone number for a refund next time or they could change a different dish for me. So I went for a refund and she stated she had to bring the noodles back to the kitchen to inspect prior from giving me back my refund. After taking my noodles back to the kitchen she came back and argued with me that the noodles were not moldy and it was from the discoloring of the Eggplants. I told the lady that it's not my first time ordering this dish from the restaurant, but she still said I was wrong. I questioned why she was arguing with me, and why not just give my back my refund and so she did unpleasantly.

Overall the food is average and the service isn't great, they have restrictions on their menu's were you can;t order snacks if it's not the afternoon tea time, and you can't order the satay combo if its not breakfast or afternoon tea time.

I don't think I will come back at all, when there are other HK cafe's around the area"}
{"text":"Terrible service
 I went in with my dad on a weeknight, when the place was not very busy. My dad and I stood inside waiting to be seated for at least 5 mins without being acknowledged. We didn't want to wait any longer so we left. Before this experience I have been here one other time when they just opened and the service was equally as bad."}
{"text":"Food is average here but just come here for the lobster seafood bisque in puff pastry(extra $3.99 with any set meal)!    Amazing!"}
{"text":"We come here regularly as it's in the neighborhood and the food is consistent. Do not come here expecting good service. The ladies here are efficient, but when it's busy, it takes a while to get their attention. The place is also small so there may be quite a bit of a wait during busy hours, and some tables are very close together so it may feel a bit crammed.  Prices are standard for an establishment like this in markham. I usually order the bacon and clam stirfry spaghetti with cheese and butter during dinner time. It is very flavorful and the texture is great. But the main reason I keep coming back is because of their HK milk tea. We go to many different HK cafes and this has one of the best teas."}
{"text":"This is a very unsatisfy place. There staffs let the customer wait a very long time for the food. The horrible things is unwanted things in food, evidence in photos. Bad waitress service and food quality!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"BAD / RUDE service !!    I was there on 5/10 Saturday.  My husband & I ordered a Japanese donburi & a fried rice.     God knows it took us 20 min but still no food.  The customers right next to us sat down 5 min after us.   They almost finished their food, but we were still waiting.     So we POLITELY asked the waitress.    She asked us \"what did you order?\"   Gosh!!    That means she did not even put our food into the system.  
10 more min later, fried rice came & then the donburi.     But there was NO APOLOGIES whatsoever.  So I POLITELY asked the waitress \"Did you guys forgot our food in the first place?\"   She rudely said \"NO !!\"  Then RAN AWAY~~

NO EXPLANATION the whole time for the LATE FOOD.   Won't going back anymore !!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch last week and was not overly impressed. The staff are friendly and took our orders promptly; however, the food was just \"eh.\" At almost 10 dollars a dish for baked (chicken, pork chop, or fish) on rice or spaghetti, I would've expected better. The other thing is that I sat at a booth and the amount of dust on the light fixture will make you sit still and not breathe if you don't want any extras on your dish. Will not be back unfortunately."}
{"text":"So I went there on a weekday I believe at around 10 am..and yes there were a lot of people but they sat my friend and I down right away..which was great.  We ordered the beefe satay noodles and this other breakfast item with noodles and ham.  They are would normally take 15 minutes max to make...but after 25 minutes we were still sitting at the table with nothing.  So I asked one of the waitresses and she told me that the take out takes priority and there were a lot of take out orders so ours will need to wait.  I was pretty annoyed when she said that but she also told me that they were making it so I believed her and said okay.  

15 minutes later....our food were still not at the table..but the funny thing is that the table in front of us sat down way way way after us but the mother and her kid were already pigging out on the instant noodle and sausages or whatever else were in the bowls.  So at that point i was pretty furious and I asked a male waiter where our food was and that we were waiting for 45 mins already.  The waiter looked at me, said \"I don't know\" and was about to walk away..but obviously I did not let him way away.  I told him about the other table and how their food arrived before ours.  While I was talking to him, he ROLLED HIS EYES AT ME!!!!!....I was so shocked that he actually ROLLED HIS EYES AT HIS CUSTOMER!!!  So i called him out for that and he had nothing to say so this other waitress came over and tried to sooth everything out.  She told us she will bring the food out asap..which she did.  

I will never ever ever go back to that restaurant ever again.  I can't believe that man!!...AND the looooong wait time!!"}
{"text":"LOVED ITT! 

My friend dragged me all the way here from North York. Oh boy was it worth the ride. The place is a bit hidden, in a plaza with all these other chinese restaurants. Don't really understand why the name is sugar sweet cafe, has more meals than sweets. 

The food... Oh My... It was heavenly. I ordered the BBQ pork rice dish. The pork was so moist and delicious, talking about it makes me want to go grab it now. The meal is certainly filling with their complimentary soup. YOU MUST TRY their mushroom creme soup. SO YUMMY! I also ordered a lemon honey sweet tea. It was more lemon than honey or sweet. 

Overall, a great place to have a date or to catch up. Staff are friendly and ready to help. Give this place a try. However, be ready to search for a parking spot.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Don't know why they get 2.5 stars.  I have eaten in most Hong Kong style Cafe restaurant in Toronto    This is probably one of the best ones.  Been there twice, really like their food. Taste really good, they give you big portion.  Always good business, fresh food. Price is really reasonable.  I do not expect full service like an expensive restaurant.  For the money that the customers pay, it is really worth it."}
{"text":"Quality of food definitely declined compared to couple years ago. Food is over priced for its quantity and quality. There are much better hk style cafes and restaurants around the area. Would not go again and would not recommend."}
{"text":"Went in Thursday for the chicken curry for dinner...I got a stomach flu now. Which means the chicken was under cooked. Thanks."}
{"text":"Inside and on the north end of \"Sun Wong Kwok\" Peach Tree Plaza (Kennedy and South of Hwy7). 

This is another Hong Kong style cafe like a few inside the plaza but this one is newly renovated and still kept some interesting food choice and combos.

Prices are reasonable and so are portions. They open early for breakfast choices. 

Overall I'd come back for a quick meal but wouldn't expect to be wow'd.

Bring cash! Seating are also limited."}

Fast service, fast in and fast out."}
{"text":"Ordered double chickens in black pepper sauce and chicken in cream and tomatoe sauce. Both are good and reasonable price. However, the chicken in mixed sauce is tends to be bigger portion and slightly cheaper, lol. But I guess if you want different sauce then you just need to pay 74 cents more! ;)"}
{"text":"Valuable meal and above average food. I had breakfast
And the most expensive breakfast is $5.75. No additional charge for switching coffee and tea to Horlick or Ovaltine. Their Satay Beef Noodle is one of the best place in town."}
{"text":"Location/Service
- Within New Kennedy Plaza, plenty of parking available (just be careful!)
- Easy to find sign, like their name it's very blue
- Restaurant size is small, so get pretty busy during peak hours - they do offer takeout as an option 
- Staff are nice, can speak Cantonese/Mandarin
- Decor/Atmosphere is pretty standard to any typical Chinese HK Style cafe

Food
- I tend to come here more for their dinners, portion wise was relatively big in terms of their price and I like there is a variety of items for you to choose from
- Their milk tea is also nice and consistent as well
- In this picture is their breakfast menu - your standard typical egg + sausage + macaroni with a side of butter toaste
- Eating this while growing up, so it's not super good nor bad, does give a good comforting feeling
- Again, breakfast portion is pretty heavy - so for around $7 (drink included) it does fill you up!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times, and I think this is a decent go to HK style cafe. I particularly recommend their malaysian curry dishes which I think they do very well. Other dishes I've enjoyed here include the baked pork chop rice as well as their baked pasta dishes. Pricing for their dishes are pretty fair too in my opinion. What sets this HK style cafe apart from others is that they do not charge an extra fee if you want to switch your drink (that comes w/ your meal) to Horlick/ Hot Chocolate! Since sometimes I'm just not feeling the milk tea/coffee it's nice to be offered an alternative without being made to pay an extra .50-$1. Overall, one of my go tos for a quick lunch if I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Meh, They used to be better when they first opened.

I don't know why its always crowded though."}
{"text":"I frequently come here for a quick hearty lunch. I always get their baked chicken steak with black pepper sauce. They make it much better than most places; the chicken is cooked more well done, and the skin is crispy. 

The place is small, so it will be busy during dinner time. Sometimes you may have to wait."}
{"text":"Hmm, not sure if its just this time that I wasn't impressed, but this is a cafe I don't regularly come to. Gotta say, it was an underwhelming experience. 

First off, the wait on a Saturday was a bit long for a cafe like that, but at the same time, not surprising considering the location. Upon sitting down, they moved us to another table. A bit annoying, but okay since we moved to a more comfortable table.

We ordered the BBQ Pork and Curry Beef Tendons, but both were a bit off. The BBQ was all overcooked, making the meat a bit tough. I personally like my BBQ pork tender with some fat on it, so it was a bit hard to eat. The curry was too sweet, as the balance of flavours was off. With too much sweetness and not even saltiness/spice, it made the curry unbearable. Thankfully, the Milk Tea was quite good, making it the best part of the meal. 

Service wasn't all that great either. I understand working quickly/efficiently to have a faster turnover rate of customers, but you can also be a little nicer. One server was just kinda bitchy when she took our orders. 

Not the best cafe I've been to, and don't plan on going back anytime soon. Ended up here on a secondary option, so it's not an ideal situation anyways."}
{"text":"I used to come to this restaurant often for lunch and dinner. In the past, the food was decent and the management of staff and service wasn't particularly bad either. However, in recent months, I have experienced tremendous decline in their service and quality of food.

When we sat down at our table, we asked for three cups of water and subsequently ordered our dish. I believe we waited for 10 minutes before any server even approach us (clearly they have forgotten the drinks). Later, we observed and noticed that the table next to us already got their food, even when they arrived later than us. We asked for water again, and took another 6 minutes before the servers finally brought them to our table. When we asked for the bill, I was raising my hand for a good 5 minutes before any server notices me. Let's be clear: This restaurant isn't big at all and they had four servers in total. Clearly, the servers or management weren't efficient at all.

Food quality: My mom had a cow tongue dish with rice. The meat was very hard and over-cooked. The dish was supposed to be baked but it turned out to be under-baked. I had unagi spaghetti pasta. As you may have guessed, the unagi had bone in it. 

Not all is lost, the pasta spaghetti itself was good. Unfortunately, the quality of service made the whole dining experience down the drain. Potential customers should be mindful of it. The servers are way too busy for you."}
{"text":"I used to be a regular at Blue Ocean, but as the time passed, the quality of the food, I found, started to go down hill.  This HK style Cafe is more modern and bright than some of the other neighbourhood restaurants.   The food itself is more pricy for your average Cafe.   If you want a set dinner with baked rice or spaghetti, soup and a tea, you're looking at about $10+tax.  The veggie soup was questionably super oily tonight.  As I was attempting to drink my soup, I eyed my husband's mushroom cream soup with envy.  The Thai minced pork and eggplant E fu noodles just didn't taste right.   I ended up leaving half of it untouched and didn't feel like packing the rest for lunch the next day.   

I had to force the husband to treat me to woofles after tonight's dinner.  If I had other options, ie husband doesn't force us to eat here, I'd go to another restaurant in this plaza."}
{"text":"I see a lot of 1-3 stars here which I'm not exactly surprised. The food was like the rest of the bunch out there. Here they have a big focus on baked rice/pastas, which I totally ooze for.. But that's not why I gave 4 stars. Reason for the 4th star was the service and how quickly they worked. This place reminded me a lot of New City Cafe where food came fast, service was good and everything taste decent. I'm a big sucker for good service, I don't care how good your foods taste.. If service sucks, it leaves a bad taste in my mouth.
They were very friendly from the time we strolled in until the very end. Service was quick and adequate, never took too long or had us waiting much. Food like I said was decent and no different than the rest around here. I said I ooze for baked foods, so I obviously ordered a double cheese baked chicken rice. Honestly, the chicken was slightly over cooked and on the tough side. However, their service made up for it.. For me it's kind of like a freebie point lol do me right and I'll be nice 

Altogether it was a wonderful night with decent meal and good service! What more can I say..?"}
{"text":"I come to this joint when I'm craving cheesy baked fried rice. YUMMMM"}
{"text":"WARNING: don't speak Chinese,  expect to get no service. They prefer to serve Chinese speaking customers. I'm Chinese,  but I'm born here so I don't speak it well. Got no service. Actually I got bad service. 

If i could give this place a ZERO STAR I would. And I see myself as a veey fair reviewer and rarely give a 1 star to restaurants. But this place just broke that record for the worst service and lack of organization. 

First of all, Good luck getting served here if you speak English and not Chinese or remotely look Chinese. We waited 20min for any server to give us service once we got  seated ... that's actually kind of ridiculous. My friend and I didn't speak Chinese we spoke English which got us less service as the waiting staff didn't want to give us eye contact. What are we? ALIENS or something? I thinking living in Canada you need to know English as a language no? We literally had to flag someone to give us some attention 2x before they actually took our order. 

Secondly, when my order came it was missing parts to it (I.e. the sauce bowl that came with the plate was empty) took us another 10 minutes to flag someone to let them know they gave me an empty sauce bowl. The waitress took it to the back kitchen and then came back with my meal 5 minutes later. Once my meal was plopped in front of me, I then begin to notice a HUUUUGE LONG piece of pewbby hair on my rice (notice on the photo I am attaching with this review). I was so disappointed and now disgusted with my order I don't even know how we continued to wait here and eat. My friend was hungry so we toughed this one out and stayed. Finally all our orders came but after a long wait. I felt that after I complained about the long disgusting piece of hair in my meal, all they did was pick it out with their finger and plopped it back on my table. GROSS!!!! 

I didn't eat my rice at this point. By the time we finished our meal we realized they didn't even serve us our soup which came with our meal. This is literally an hour later they didn't even think to check if they got our order right or wrong. Here I am frustrated with this nasty place. Service is horrible and kitchen is possibly dirty. 

Please do not go here unless you want to be ignored and not get any service at all. I'm a very fair reviewer but when your restaurant gives bad service to paying customers, I think someone has to speak up and say something otherwise restaurants that are run badly will continue to run badly because they don't know. I won't be coming here again. I'll be going back to my favorite one which is NEW CITY located literally beside blue ocean restaurant. 

This place gets a ZERO star from me if it was even possible. Fix your customer service weather you are a small restaurant or a large restaurant. Otherwise you will get bad reviews for treating your customers badly. 

Dining should always be a good experience especially if your a paying customer to eat at such a place."}
{"text":"I had their curry this time and it definitely tastes weird, it felt like i was drinking pure corn starch with minimal water.

I enjoyed going to the previous restaurant in this location, Happy Cafe but I believe I will no longer be visiting this restaurant. It is very unfortunate because the decor is nice, it's in a great location and many regulars of Happy Cafe look forward to the quality of food and service. WHAT HAPPENED?????"}
{"text":"Hands down. One of the BEST HK-style milk tea in Markham/GTA. Just for that, I've increased my 3-star rating to a 4-star. 

MILK TEA: If you're looking for good HK-style milk tea, this place will not let you down. Tea is rich, at the same time the milk is thick. Syrup is integrated. I have no complaints. Their milk tea is one of the very few in the GTA that will keep me awake - their tea is that strong. It's good :) I can fully rely on it for my night shifts :)

As for menu options and their food though... it's a-ok~ 3 stars. Their quality is good, don't get me wrong, but portion sizes are small, and menu options are... unusual (not strange! but definitely not your usual standard HK-cafe choices!) They limit their menu selection for some reason, so if you're looking for a meal here on the cheaper end, you're pretty much stuck with soup noodles! Only certain limited items on their lunch or dinner menu will come with a soup and drink - and I personally don't like the choices offered. Menu is kind of difficult to grasp, fonts are small and could be more organized. But all in all, most standard HK Chinese dishes are there, but pricey for what it's worth! You might as well go eat at a food court and you'll get greater quantity!"}
{"text":"Came in on a late Saturday afternoon and surprisingly did not have to wait. The restaurant is small but like most HK Cafes, tables turn fairly quickly.

Prices are on the higher end but most things come with a soup which was quite decent. As for the main dishes, nothing to write home about. 

Fried Instant Noodle with Pork Chop ($8.99) was very meh. Wasn't as tasty as I had hoped and left more to be desired. I've done better with instant noodles. 

Baked Rice, Double Cheese with Pork Chop ($9.99) looked delicious but I was not a big fan of the nacho cheese. Would much rather have more mozzarella or parmesan. The pork chop and cream sauce was pretty good. I still stand by Keung's baked rice though.

Didn't particularly enjoy anything I had but rather just ate for the sake of eating and to get some food in my tummy. We finished a good chunk of our food and left it at that. I probably wouldn't go back.

There are much better options around such as New City that's in the same plaza."}

{"text":"Your average Chinese ???, on the slightly expensive side, but a lot of the dishes come with soup. 

I tried the Hainanese Chicken, which was mediocre. I think the Lobster Bisque soup is really good, thick and creamy for a Chinese place though. This dish I would recommend! Another dish that I think is really tasty is their stir fried instant noodles dish. It has a lot of flavour, though a little pricey as well. 

I guess this place is kind of in the middle of the average overpriced place for teenagers to come and ???."}
{"text":"When I first started going to Blue Ocean Cafe, it was because of the previous previous restaurant in the same location. 
The food was five stars at first, but then it started deteriorating.

Dishes came out very boring, bland and curry tastes like it came out of can. The same canned curry paste i use at home. Why am I paying 12 dollars for canned curry???

Design is nice. Staff is friendly-ish. Could be better."}
{"text":"Summary: a decent \"cha chan teng\" with a couple of standout dishes with somewhat cramped seating conditions

Top Must-Get: fried instant noodles
Top Regret: hainanese chicken

It's hard to stand out in Markham's oversaturated Hong Kong style tea time meal market. Blue Ocean doesn't do anything bad - it offers a fairly typical menu with alright prices - but short of the fried instant noodles, no dish really wowwed me.

First off, the seating arrangements come across as a little cramped. It's not a huge space, but they pack in quite a few tables - if you don't like sitting with strangers, you might be out of luck (although from what I see, it's not THAT packed mostly.)

They offer two kinds of complimentary soups and I always get the cream one - it's pretty solid here, perhaps a bit thicker than other places (which is how I like it!) Quite good!

I have two meals that I judge these kinds of restaurants on: hainanese chicken and Portuguese sauce chicken.

The Hainanese chicken was not at all impressive. In fact, it was downright disappointing. Chicken lacked flavour, rice lacked flavour, and portion size was severely lacking.

After that, my friend kept wanting to come here for lunch, and I didn't have a better suggestion, so we kept coming and I just kept trying new things... Nothing really stood out until I stopped the fourth day and said \"bro, can you order me what you get?\"

Instant revelation: the regulars who come know what to order.

I got the fried instant noodles and they were GOOD. Flavourful and lasting taste in your mouth... Savour it. It transformed this from a forgettable experience to a pretty solid lunch spot. 

I'm not a huge fan of their breakfasts, but my friend has gotten that a couple of times and seemed to really enjoy it.

For their baked noodle specials, they are not shy about loading it up with cheese, and I appreciate that they don't cheap out here.

All in all, I have got to ask my friend to order again for me next time as well (something different!)"}
{"text":"Went for weekday lunch.
Love that they have Cdn style cream soup option.  Not the standard starchy ones at other cafes.  Think today was either squash or pumpkin.  Nice change.

Their curry brisket was very tender.  Their curry tastes of lemongrass and coconut.  Really good stuff.

Food came fast.  Lunch menu has lots of options such as noodle soups,  Malaysian stirfried noodles, rice and the standard pork chop/steak rice dishes.

Probably the best diner at Peachtree.  Can't wait to go back to try their ramen and other dishes.

Only minus is tables are a bit cramped but usually meal is fast and efficient.  Get in and get out."}
{"text":"We wanted to head over to New City for late afternoon brunch but since there were too many people there, we went to Blue Ocean instead and were seated immediately. 

Service was slow and inefficient but I am told that is the norm for these kind of places. That is okay! You just got to be assertive here. 

We went for the baked pork chop rice and the Malaysian style beef brisket curry. Although the menus aren't clear you do get your choice of a hot drink and soup. Cold beverages and Ovaltine upgrade do cost extra. 

The food came out quickly but the soup and the HK style did take longer than I would have liked.

The food was comforting and satisfying. The brisket was tender and plentiful and the curry was really flavorful. The pork chop was nicely breaded and I liked the fried rice on the bottom. Both of the meats were fairly lean and weren't fatty. The tomato sauce was nicely sweet and acidic. But despite being called a 'bake', it really wasn't because the sauce was just thrown on top of the rice and pork chop with some cheese. We went with the tomato vegetable soup which did have a decent amount of veggies and was nice, sweet, and warm."}
{"text":"Perfect for those late lunch and dinner location for good price and huge portion. The milk tea is one of best for the value, you will get more than what you pay for, meal comes with soup and drink. A huge selection of different dishes for everyone craving, can't go wrong coming here. Highly recommend for anyone want a quick bite"}
{"text":"very Hong Kongy food. the tables/seating look almost like a cafeteria if not for the booths. but food is pretty decent, a variety of specials/combos(dish/drink/soup). had hainanese chicken and rice here, wasn't bad"}
{"text":"A decent hk style cafe. Food tastes good, always arrive fast, lemon iced tea tastes good and fresh. I would highly recommend you if you like hong kong cafe. It's usually packed during weekend and it's just walk in, sometimes it's very hard to find parking at the plaza. They only accept cash, so make sure you have cash."}
{"text":"TIP: Make sure you DO NOT order from the middle-aged lady (See Lai) in a ponytail and glasses with the RBF. She is rude AF, forgets your orders and is completely unapologetic about it.

This was one of my favourite HK style cafés (Cha Chaan Tengs aka CCT), with their Ribeye Steak being high quality for a CCT. However, quality seems to have gone down as of late. 

To top it all off, the RBF waitress with the rectangular rimmed glasses forgot our extra orders of Escargot and  French Onion Soup, which she had repeated to us when we placed our order. When we brought it up to another waitress, who consulted with the RBF waitress, cleaning the table in front of us, she unapologetically responded with, \"Nope - didn't put it in\". 

We decided to cancel the FO soup order as we had  pretty much finished our meals, but were still missing the regular order of Soup that comes with the Steak Dinner, and the RBF waitress did not even have the courtesy to offer us the soup, for which we had to ask for. When we did ask for it, again she acted as if we were making a new order, and did not appear apologetic for her multiple mistakes throughout our entire meal.

While I do not go to CCTs expecting good customer service, this level of bad service was simply ridiculous and unacceptable."}
{"text":"My friend who lives in Markham recommended this place as an alternative for the Hainanese chicken rice since my bf loves the one at Phoenix. We came on a Sunday night, relatively late for dinner between 8pm and 8:30pm and the place was still packed surprisingly. We waited for about 20mins and were finally seated. My friend recommended the Malaysian curry, but I opted for the baked rice/spaghetti. The bf got the Hainanese chicken rice and it definitely comparable to the one at Phoenix. I liked the one here slightly more as the chicken was a lil more tasty and 'fresh.' I tried my friend's curry and it pretty good- not too spicy and had a sweetness to it. Next time I will be ordering that for sure. I had the baked chicken with 'ying yang' sauce and their tomato sauce was pretty good- not too sweet or sour. Their baked dish portion was pretty big, good thing I was hungry but this is definitely shareable.

All our meals came with a soup and drink and were approximately $10 which is a pretty common price for dinner at the HK cafes in the area. They have many dishes to choose from so if the above items aren't your fancy- try something else...they even have ramen lol. 

The last item to mention is their Milk Tea- man oh man...this was pretty good, smooth and freshly made. Now I have another Tea spot in Markham! Be prepared to wait and give this place a try. 
Not sure about the previous reviews about bad food causing stomach issues but the 3 of us were fine :)"}
{"text":"Their portion sizes seem to have become larger and in particular their lunch specials are quite on par with nearby restaurants in the mall. Their lunch specials are around $8 and include a starter soup and hot drink along with the main. Most people tend to go for the baked rice or spaghetti since their other lunch items are around $12 which is a little higher than standard lunch fare."}
{"text":"This place is located in New Kennedy Square and has been opened around a year, I believe.

Blue Ocean Cafe is like most Hong Kong Style Cafes that you roll into. Sometimes it gets crowded. They don't have enough staff to serve when it gets busy.

The Tea sets are not really tea set priced. Just like any other item you see on the menu. Most items are over $4.75-$5. I.e. A bowl of Fish Ball noodles with Soup is that price. Cold drinks are additional cost of course. Additional charge is more than usual Hong Kong Style Cafes.

The price is a little bit like Phoenix which is considerably more pricey but I would prefer this place compared to Phoenix. 

All in All, would be back."}
{"text":"Located at New Kennedy Plaza in the heart of Markham, Blue Ocean Cafe has a lot to offer ranging from the typical Hong Kong cusine staples to South East Asian fare. Now onto the food and drinks. 

The Food.

My party of three tried out the Hainanese Chicken Rice, Chiu Chau Style Beef in Satay Sauce Stir Fried Noodles and Peppercorn Sauce Mini-Steaks with rice from the extensive lunch menu. I also had a peek at the dinner menu and I must say the choices are abundant and can easily satisfy even the pickiest of eaters. 

To start off,  we got the complimentary soup that came with our lunch order. The soup was a choice between creme of mushroom or borsch. The creme  of mushroom had a bit of mushroom and flavour but not enough flavour to my liking. 

The Hainanese Chicken Rice was tender and flavourful which is always a good sign. The Satay Beef Stir Fried Noodles was delicious albeit the presentation looked really sloppy. The mini-steaks were tender and juicy with enough peppercorns in the sauce to give it that extra kick. 

Portions were just right for all of us. 

The Drinks:

Since it was a pretty balmy date out, I decided to order the iced lemon tea. 
The tea was a bit more sugary than sour for my taste buds.

Overall, it is a great place with an extensive menu to grab a bite for any of the three meals of the day. Definitely give this place a try when you're in the area."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: quite crowded for lunch, a place to grab quick food

Food: 
1. Cheese spaghetti bolognese: 2/5, nothing special, sauce wasn't that flavourful 
2. Hai nam chicken: 2/5, the rice was a bit too moisted, chicken had lots of fat  
Price: 6.00-8.00 for lunch special, included soup and a drink

Overall: nothing really stood out, prices were cheap, burned myself a few times with the hot spaghetti plate"}
{"text":"This place is hit and miss but you wouldn't know it if you were standing in line. You will find crowds during lunch and dinner time but the turnover is pretty high (all thanks some sort of mutation back in the day that has made us Chinese folks super efficient).

There's been a lot of good and bad said about this place and I agree. At least for the food but as for the service, one would expect this kind of service given our culture and the style of establishment this place stands for.

I am not going to tell you what to eat but I do have a few tips. They don't bake or sear meat very well here. Quite often if you order pan fried something or baked something...chances are the meat is way overcooked, dry and somewhat chewy. If you want meat then stick to stuff that's braised such as curry or stir fried.

Secondly, don't do pasta unless if it's spaghetti bolognese (it's alright). The pasta will often be overcook, underdone or too dry but never really right.

They have some very interesting and appealing fusion stuff with Malaysian, Thai, Japanese and of course Western influences. I would say stick with the true HK stuff and their Malaysian curries."}
{"text":"I usually go here for breakfast during the weekend.  It is always busy, so service is a little lacking.  Food is good.  Their milk tea is worth visiting this place."}
{"text":"This is a pretty average HK style cafe in Markham. Good value, nice options, and portions are fairly decent depending on what you order. I find that the service seems slower when they're actually not too busy, but when they're packed (like for lunch, afternoon tea, or breakfast) they move a lot faster. Suppose its a kitchen staffing thing? But it's not a mega long wait or anything so I don't really mind. Usually I get the baked pork chop rice. I find the sauce to be quite decent here and not overly salty like other HK cafe's I've tried. The cream sauce dishes are not ones that I recommend, just because I personally don't enjoy them as much. Sometimes I taste it and it's just really weirdly watery cream sauce, and other times, it's thick like they added thickener but no seasoning to balance it back out. I just haven't really had a good experience with the cream sauces so I order tomatoe based sauces or the black pepper sauces. Noodles in soup are quite standard here so a safe choice :)
Fairly clean place and a nice amount of seating considering the size of the restaurant. It's a great place to just stop by for a quick bite and parking is relatively easy :)"}
{"text":"I came here because of Yelp this past Sunday.  Been meaning to look up new places to try and I swung by here after looking through the Yelp page for this restaurant.  Arrived after 2:30pm on a Sunday and it was packed.  Waited for a table for about ten minutes and was seated... The restaurant itself is pretty small, so it was slightly more cramped than I expected.

Ordered the afternoon tea special for a thin steak with salad ($6.75), and my mom got a satay noodle ($5.50).  Overall, pretty good flavour even though portions are more appropriate for an afternoon snack (not lunch).  Will try to come here again and see what their full meals are like!"}
{"text":"Typical Hong Kong style cafe with prompt service and pretty decent food. In the afternoon, they have an afternoon tea menu as well as a lunch menu.

I got the fish ball rice noodle soup (from the afternoon tea menu) and my boyfriend ordered the baked fish fillet cutlet with cream sauce & cheese on rice (from the lunch menu). The noodle soup was good but nothing special; I actually liked the baked rice a lot more, would recommend!"}
{"text":"This is a promising HK-style cafe in the area. The first time I went was about a month ago, went 3 times in a week 'cause I was so eager to try the menu items. I would say it's similar to Firefly/Phoenix type, but with better service and more variety. With white walls and grey/black tables/chairs, the interior is very clean and modern. 

The first thing I tried was the Curry Beef Brisket for lunch. The texture and taste of the curry is very flavorful, not too spicy. (But on another occasion it  was much spicier with many pieces of beef tendon/skin rather than brisket) Some of the bigger beef pieces were a bit tough. The meals come with a drink and soup. I really like the vegetable soup - very good flavor with lots of vegetables. 

Another time for dinner, I had the Hainese Chicken Rice. The portion was huge - about 7 large, meaty pieces of chicken. It did not have much Hainan flavor, but was very tender. The rice also lacked Hainan flavor and even the sauces weren't that great, but as a meal, it was good. **EDIT: 7/25 The Hainan Chicken Rice today was so good! I think it improved. Both the chicken and rice were oilier and more flavorful, and the garlic chips on top of the rice were very crispy. **

The Baked Pork Chop Rice is imo the best in the area and my staple dish here. The sauce has tomato flavor without being too heavy/thick and with the cheese, it's so good!

The Japanese fried chicken donburi is surprisingly good - crispy chicken, rice with a sweet sauce. (But no combo)

Overall, for lunch and dinner there is a lot of variety - from the standard baked rice/spaghetti to Taiwanese-broth noodles/Japanese/Malaysian curry influences. The value and taste is great for the price (for most combos that are around $7.99) This has definitely become my go-to cafe and is very popular and packed most of the time."}
{"text":"Typical Hong Kong-style diner. They've got all the standard stuff you would expect. A fairly good selection of set menus for breakfast, lunch, tea time, and dinner. 

Food overall is pretty good. 

I especially appreciate how concentrated their tea is. It's perfect for a yuan yang (half coffee half milk tea drink).

There may be a queue when you get there, but turnover is quick. You rarely need to wait long. 

I enjoy coming here with my family when we crave quick Chinese food."}
{"text":"My family and I typically go to New City but because they're closed this week, we decided to go to Blue Ocean instead. We have been before and it wasn't bad but yesterday's experience was horrible. We each ordered a plate and upgraded our soup to the lobster bisque and usually it takes about 20 minutes to make. Waited and waited and nothing came. Even my dad's normal soup never came. So when we flagged down a waitress, she's like the bill? I said no. She walked away and comes back and reiterates the bill again and asked if we needed a box. We said we didn't ask for the bill yet because we wanted to follow up with our soup order. She claims she doesn't know anything because she's only in charged of the bar and turns out the waitress didn't even put it into the system that we wanted the lobster bisque. She said she can put it in now but I was not going to wait another 20 minutes for it. Overall, not the greatest food and definitely not the friendliest staff members."}
{"text":"Looking at the ratings for this cafe, one would think that this place is really not worth checking out. I actually only gave this place a shot because my best friend said the food here is really good, and sometimes you can't judge a place for yourself without actually trying it, despite the experiences that other patrons have had. So a few weekends ago when she suggested to eat there since we were in that plaza anyway, I figured I\"ll give it a shot and see how it is. 

I was quite surprised at how good the food tasted. Granted I only tried two of the dishes they serve here so it's hard to say whether everything on the entire menu was good, but the fact that we had to line up and get a number ticket in order to get a seat tells you how busy the place is for Saturday lunch. We got a table about 15 mins later, and I like that for a chinese cafe they didn't rush us to order food.

In the end we ordered spaghetti with bolognese sauce and cheese (chinese style) and fried rice noodles with beef (with swiss style soy sauce). Both dishes were great! They were tasty and delicious. I always liked spaghetti and bolognese (chinese style) so usually that's one of the first things I try at chinese cafes to see if they are any good. This place did it pretty well :) The sauce wasn't too runny, it was sticky enough that it would hang onto the noodles so I din't thave to scoop sauce afterwards. Not too salty, and the taste reminds me very much of the spaghetti and bolognese that they serve in HK cafes. Next, my biggest surprise was actually fried irce noodles with beef. Not a lot of places do a good job of making this dish, despite how popular it is in chinese cafes and even food courts. the soy sauce they used was very good. My fiance (who was also with us) loves this dish, and he said that this is probably one of the best renditions he has ever had. The noodles were fried perfectly, not too mushy because you can easily do that to rice noodles, just the right texture allowing you to chew on. The beef was seasoned nicely and overall the entire dish did not feel overly oily (another problem with this dish in a lot of chinese places when they use wayyy too much oil) and so it didn't feel greasy when we were eating this dish. I would come back to this restaurant just to eat this dish again because I can honestly say that I haven't had much better ones in the other chinese cafes I\"ve eaten in.

Anyway would definitely like to come back again sometimes but perhaps not during SAturday lunch coz it's so busy. But I would say if you like these two dishes it's worth coming here and checking it out :)"}
{"text":"Not sure why the low-ish review here, because I quite like their food and the place is certainly packed all the time. Wifi doesn't work though, like many had pointed out. 
We came in for lunch and had to line up to get a seat. Our food came rather quickly and the taste was pretty good too. Even though normally order cold milk tea, their hot milk tea is suprisingly really good.
I did end up getting upset stomach though, but my tariyaki chicken rice bowl did have raw egg in there..."}
{"text":"This place is in New Kennedy Square towards the north side and near New City Restaurant. Pretty standard HK style cafe - decor is modern and looks clean. Service is a standard as an Asian place - brisk and to the point.

Food is fairly average - nothing spectacular but if you're craving this is a good place to go to get your fix. Meals usually come with soup, usually tomato or cream. The cream soup is generally okay but this time it felt oddly chunky/powdery. It looks like there's a bit of mushroom in there too. The tomato baked pork chop rice is a good choice - the sauce is nicely balanced without too much sweetness and a natural tomato taste as well. The pork is already in pieces rather than having a slab of meat - good for if you're feeling lazy!"}
{"text":"It was really busy for the morning breakfast special before 11am. Had to wait about 10-15 minutes. Inside is pretty small and tables are crammed close together so its almost like you are eating with strangers. 

Food was average. Prices were good though with most dishes costing about $5-7. 

We were given an extra scrambled egg sandwich and we told the waitress that we already got all our sandwiches but they let us keep it and we were not charged extra for it. More food for me :) 

I would much rather have food at New City which it right next door since I find the food there to be one step above in quality."}
{"text":"Ahaha funny story with this place! At first I thought this place was a spa of some sort! Boy was I wrong! This place is similar to those chain Chinese restaurants that have Hong Kong style tea and baked pork chop. 

This place decor is quite calming and the staff was friendly. The tvs there slide show the food which is pretty nifty. I love previewing what food I eat, especially at new places haha.

I ordered the Malaysia beef brisket curry with rice. It was quite good, but I wish it was a bit spicier. The prices seem similar to other places so that's good haha! There is free wifi, but it didn't seem to work for me oh well. There is tons of parking in this plaza so don't fret on spots!"}
{"text":"Service @ lunch is very very quick.  They come out with your food 5-10 minutes after you order despite it being very busy.  It's pretty good relative to other \"cha chan teng's\".  I had the baked pork rice and it wasn't too salty and just the right amount of taste.  I liked that they put cheese on it ^-^!  We also ordered BBQ pork rice, which was quite good as well.  I was pretty surprised at how tender the BBQ pork was.  Lunch comes with a soup - cream soup or borscht."}
{"text":"They must have been checking my reviews. I came back here twice in the past week as New City is undergoing renovations until the 18th, and I noticed they added a lot of new stuff in their menus. I tried a few of their new items, including beef enoki mushrooms in satay noodle soup and tonkotsu ramen.

The satay noodle soup didn't have enough soup to start. Once they gave me more soup, the meal was actually not bad! The tonkotsu ramen had decent noodles and pork, but the soup was quite sweet for my liking.

They recently discontinued the braised beef noodle soup. Thank god! That had to be one of the most MSG-y items I've ever had.

Welcome back Blue Ocean. You still had better food when you first opened, but at least now I probably won't overlook you if New City goes under renovations again or is overcrowded."}
{"text":"One of the better HK style cafes around. Speedy service and tasty food. My favourites are the baked pork chop rice, satay beef noodle, and cha siu fan. Pricing is on the higher end of HK cafes (similar to a place like Phoenix).

Service is fine although you can't really expect anything from HK style cafes"}
{"text":"After hearing my father-in-law's rave about their curry, I decided to give it a try. I ordered Curry Chicken and Baked Pork Chops with rice. Not only did it come with one piece of pork chop, the meat was of poor quality, it was fatty. The curry chicken though was above average- proportion was reasonable, and the sauce was addictive. Think I'd only go back if I have severe curry cravings , since this place is not that far from mine."}
{"text":"I'm usually a big fan of HK style cafe, and they usually are a hit or miss. This place unfortunately didn't really work for me. Prices were alright, although I will admit I've been to places that are both cheaper and tasted better."}
{"text":"3.5

Another weekend, another HK style cafe to try.  Blue Ocean offers more than your average HK style cafe in terms of dishes and is a pretty good place to try out if you're in the area.

Pros:
Menu is more extensive than most HK style cafes
Prices are good

Cons:
Service is a bit slow

Reading past reviews one would think to avoid this place.  However, after going myself I didn't see most or any of the problems the previous reviewers experienced.  We came on a Saturday night.  It was busy but the turnover was fast and we were seated within minutes.  Blue Ocean is situated in a plaza with a ton of other HK style cafes.  If the wait time is huge, you can always go to the other ones here so it's no biggie if this place is too busy at any given time.

One look at the menu and I see items offered that I don't normally see at other HK style cafes.  They have 10 oz rib steak dinner here!!  I didn't order it this time but I will be back to try..  maybe.. lol.  There's also Japanese inspired pastas a la Shiso tree.  I ended up ordering the Hainese chicken on rice and my GF got the pan fried chicken steak on pasta with cream and tomato sauces.  Both items were on a seperate special menu dinners which all come with soup and a drink.

The food came out rather quickly.  My Hainese chicken rice was pretty standard.  Nothing special, nothing amazing.  One thing to note is that it was all boneless.  I don't know if I just got lucky or if this is a standard for thm, but it's a good thing.  My GF's pasta was alright too.  My little one loved the pasta and she's rather picky now so that's another plus.  The tomato sauce wasn't tomato-y enough though.  It tasted a bit watered down.  All in all, the food is good for HK style cafe standards.  You can't come in to this place and expect 5 star cuisine.  You shouldn't be going to HK style cafes if you do.

The prices here are standard and at times pretty good depending on the dish in question.  You get pretty good value to.  The portions could be bigger, but it's not downright abysmal.  The service can get slow at times when it's busy, but it's nowhere near as bad as previous reviewers say it is.  I saw a table beside us order a baked pasta with spaghetti. It came out with penne by mistake and tbe customers really wanted the spaghetti and they took it back for them no questions asked and made them a new one pretty quickly.  

All in all, Blue Ocean was a pleasant experience for us.  It wasn't amazing but it was nowhere near as bad as previous reviews make it out to be.  Either they've really cleaned up their act since those reviews are it was never that to begin with.  Either way, it's a decent place and I can totally see myself coming back when I want a cheap meal."}
{"text":"Closer to a 2.5
Quality and value has went significantly downhill for Blue Ocean and it pains me to update this review for my go-to HK style cafe.
Prices generally increased by 10-20%. Tables also got smaller?
One night we asked for cream soups and were brought borscht instead when we were already having our entrees. When we asked, the servers said the cream soups were long gone and we should have asked sooner...sure, we understood you run out of things but this attitude?
In their ramen, there was strong tastes of dish water and its just not edible. 
I think the decline in overall experience is easily reflected in the amount of customers. There used to be huge lineups but now you can easily get seats within moments."}
{"text":"This is a slightly better version of your typical HK style cafe, still shouldn't be expecting more than what's the usual. It's clean and not too squishy. It is expected that service may be a little slow and you need to be a bit more assertive when making sure you're on the waitlist for a seat or that your food is ordered correctly/still coming. If you're coming during lunch hours or afternoon tea, expect a long wait. The waitresses here are very nice, not the typical loud and rude.. you know. Definitely works in your favour if you can speak Cantonese. Their service isn't too slow in comparison to other HK cafes, I honestly feel like it's on the faster side actually. OH and they do have a card machine. It's rare that a hk cafe takes debit because most of them are cash only. 

The prices are average, and usually includes a cream or borscht soup, your decently sized entree, and a drink. You'll probably spend between $7-12 per person depending on if you're coming for lunch or their afternoon tea specials. I've tried many different items on the menu but the ones that I usually go for are the Malaysian ox-tongue curry, fish cutlet/chicken wings/steak with fries, or a baked rice (which is served on fried rice, not plain white rice). I usually get the cream soup which is a hit or miss because I don't like their carrot one, but I do love their mushroom one. Their iced lemon tea and milk teas are sooo goood! I also love the way they fry their fish cutlets and fries, it's better than some other hk cafes. Their afternoon tea portions are slightly smaller which is expected, but their lunch portions are huge (I never finish it). However, I do want to mention that I love Hainanese Chicken but this is the one place I won't order it from. I've had it here 3 times already and yeah I seriously don't like it. It's very small, dry and lean... tastes like chicken breast but it probably isn't, I have no idea. The ones at Phoenix and Fav Cafe are 100x better. If only they can execute this dish better, I'd come more often. All in all, it isn't as bad as some people claim it is. You just have to come here with the right expectations."}
{"text":"Looks can be deceiving, food there looks really good but just average, my double cheese seafood pasta was disappointing, and the double cheese is just cheese sauce with the processed cheese squares that has been torched to melt on top. The cream soup was powdery and bland. Would not recommend getting it, but there's wifi there, joking, doesn't work."}
{"text":"I think this place definitely deserve more then the 2.5 star rating it currently has on Yelp. It's a legit HK style Cafe.

Been here many times over the past 5 years or so.

I think they make the one of the best Portuguese Chicken Baked Rice ever!!! - which is my standard order.

I do usually get take-out and rarely dine-in.

My friends like to order the Pork-Chop Baked Rice, HK-style Toast, and Hainanese Chicken Rice.

Take-out lunch with a milk tea drink is usually just under $10pp."}
{"text":"Milk tea is too bitter.
 
Like others have said I also get stomach aches from ordering the afternoon tea menu.

Really hope they get this checked out before someone gets really sick. 

Probably won't come back until they get their heads back in the game."}
{"text":"Came here a few time, and it's been my go to place lately because it has pretty good prices, a lot of specials, and the food is decent and always up to par. I've had many dishes from Portuguese chicken rice to various noodle dishes. 

This place is always busy around lunch and dinner, and is fairly popular. Parking is also pretty hard to find in this plaza. This restaurant is kind of small too and you'll be sitting pretty close to other customers, but this is common in this type of restaurant.

I think the rating doesn't reflect how great / fine this restaurant is, it's not bad at all. It's what you would expect from an HK style cafe. I'd definitely come back here again, because I haven't been here in a while!"}
{"text":"One of my go to places when I need my hk style cafe fix. Whenever I go in I always have to order their milk tea because it's close to the milk teas in HK. I'm a lover when it comes to hk style baked bolognese spaghetti and I like to give them a thumbs up because they nailed it! I've had some of their other dishes and it's a pass in my opinion. People tend to hype about the ramen but I find it mediocre. The price for two is usually 20-30$ which in my opinion is super worth it since I get a drink with my meal. The service of this place can approve but I honestly don't expect customer service when I walk into a Chinese restaurant anyway. Been coming here for 5+ years and their quality is rather stable !"}
{"text":"I learnt some people said that they have the BEST HK Tea in Town.
That was why I came here to give it a try.  I ordered a cheese Penne.
The taste was not bad though but can't say very good.  But their HK TEA really
good and the price a little bit on the high side. The cheese Penne cost $11.99.  I didn't complain because i am a cheese lover."}
{"text":"Pretty good. I got the ramen with pork bone and it was delicious! $10.50. I was expecting a bit more noodles for the price but in regards to taste, it was really good :) 

Very busy place -- but turnover is quick. Typical Asian cafe where service isnt the 5 stars you hope for but they make up for it in food. 

Parking is pretty crazy because of the plaza itself. Busy times is lunch hours! 

Not a bad place to eat if you're craving some Chinese food."}
{"text":"The only thing about this restaurant is the timing. Sometimes I find service is very slow. So it's very inconsistent. 

Atmosphere is same as usual HK restaurants
 Nothing to really specially talk about. 

I do like their tea time menu as it is very comparable to their next door neighbor friendly competition , new city restaurant. Their menu has a little more variety of meats than their competitor and the quality isn't too bad.

Last time I went for a lunch and got the double cheese baked rice with fish. That cheese is delicious and so melty. Loved it! And definitely recommend it to anyone who hasn't tried it yet."}
{"text":"Blue Ocean is a Hong Kong-style restaurant/\"cha chan teng\" with a more modern twist on its dishes compared to its neighbour: New City Restaurant, which is more traditional. The interior decor is very nice and modern, and there are a fair number of tables. Seating is slightly cramped, and there's often a bit of a wait for a table if you're coming for dinner. The waiters/waitresses are friendly, but often take a while to get things done (like grabbing extra napkins or your bill). There can also be a bit of a wait for your food, so this isn't the best place to go if you're really hungry.

The food itself is pretty good! Portions are very filling and the prices are reasonable. I usually get a pork or beef baked rice or spaghetti, but the hainanese chicken rice is also very popular. The complimentary soup and drink are also nice. Of the drinks, I've had the milk tea, ovaltine, and lemon tea and they're all done pretty well. It's nice how there's a $4 upgrade from a regular soup to a lobster bisque, which is fairly rich in flavour, though no actual lobster in the soup!

All in all, this is one of my go-to Hong Kong-style cafes in Markham. It's a great spot for a quick fix of \"east-meets-west\" style dishes."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite go to HK style cafes in Markham! The food is affordable and delicious and has been consistent throughout the years. Service is as good as you can expect. Fast and efficient!
There is a wide variety of options on the menu and everything is quite decent ranging from their noodles, baked rice and curry, not to mention the large portions!
Almost all dishes come with a set drink and soup making it a super great deal.
Overall, I would totally recommend this place if you're looking for something quick yummy and affordable!"}
{"text":"The menu is your typical Hong Kong style cafe. Milk Tea is delicious and portion sizes are good. We order the Japanese Eel with Spaghetti and Ribs with rice. Service was lacking because the place was pretty busy. They only had 2 servers for about 50 seats. Our tea was never refilled or table cleared when we were clearly done our lunch. I would have ordered another milk tea if they had asked. Prices were slightly higher than other Hong Kong Style Cafes. Lunch for two was $27 including taxes and tips."}
{"text":"Another HK cafe in the Markham area. 

We've came here several times and unfortunately, bf & I both agree that the food just doesn't taste too great. 

I love their Lobster seafood bisque with puff pastry soup and escargot. That's about it. We've had a few different dishes and none of them impressed. So we're giving up on this place.

It's too bad because their soup & escargots are really good."}
{"text":"Food not warm enough by the time it gets to the table.  Some dishes are too salty.  Curry was all the rage from friends so I tried it, just too much peanut butter in the sauce.

Noodle soup broths are also too salty.

3 stars because it's cheap, it's cleaner than most HK cafes, and flavours can easily be improved. Has promise."}
{"text":"This is actually one of my favourite HK style restaurants despite the tight space and it being super busy all the time. The food is consistently good and the service is quick. I have enjoyed everything I have tried from the menu, and they make the drinks pretty well too. One time they gave incorrect change and we had to tell them, but they were quick to fix the error and apologize."}
{"text":"I have been back to Blue Ocean Cafe numerous times over the years and the quality of food has steadily going downhill.

Price wise still decent. But yesterday my Baked Pork Chop Lunch ($7.99) was served lukewarm: fried rice was cold and the sauce was gooey due to not being baked long enough. Borscht soup was bland and watery. But at least my pork chop was cooked while the lady next to me was served under cooked fish.

Maybe a pass for me for the time being."}
{"text":"Oh my god what happened to this place? Wow. First of all, for some reason they thought it'd be a good idea to install drawers under the tables during business hours. The noise, dust, and debris really made it uncomfortable to say the least but we were willing to let it slide. Unfortunately, things went down hill from there. My God. Got the drink order wrong, meal came out before the soup (russian borscht, under a thick layer of oil). Buddy got the Steak w/ garlic sauce, what he got was a boiled slab of meat heavily treated with tenderizer beneath a tasteless dark brown goo. Gross. 

My historically good Malaysian Curry has become a watery, soupy mess. 

It's crazy how bad it was. We ended up settling the bill and going next door to New City instead."}
{"text":"Came here on several occasions. The first time I came to Blue Ocean was because New City cafe was too busy. I would say it is just your average Hong Kong style cafe which serves a variety of items from baked rices to instant noodles. On the several occasions that I have come here I never had to wait in line for a seat and service was not too slow as I have read in other reviews. I have tried their afternoon special of curry fishball with noodles ($5.99) served between 2:30pm-5:00pm. It was surprisinly very flavorful and had a hearty curry taste. Nothing to really complain about other than the portion size but for $5.99 it is a really good deal. I have also tried the Japanese style Napoleon noodles which has a mixture or ingredients such as hot dog wieners, ham and spam and tomato sauce. The first couple of bites were pretty good until the sauce becomes overwhelming as it's a bit too sweet and salty. The milk tea is decent however I still prefer the smoother flavor from.New city cafe. Overall this is a nice place for Hong Kong cafe food and they do have pretty good specials for lunch and afternoon tea time."}
{"text":"Horrible. Had the Malaysian curry beef brisket rice for take out. When I got home and started eating it, the sauce was good and the beef brisket was tender BUT after I took a bite of my last piece, it was dry and smelled awful. I spat out everything that was in my mouth. The beef brisket had turned bad but they decided to cook with it. 

The soup that came with it was tasteless and watery.

Do not recommend this place at all. 0/5"}
