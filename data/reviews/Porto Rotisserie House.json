{"text":"Well to start the wine prices are great but thats where it ends. Had probably one of the worst main dishes ever. Ordered the grilled codfish which was so overcooked i coukd not cut through the exterior. It was also very very salty. The vegetable sides were the opposite very bland and no thought was given to presentation for example the boiled potato was just cut on half. Brocolli was served as one big bunch Service wise no water was offered. Table was dirty from previous customer."}
{"text":"If you have not tried it then you defiantly want to! Amazing food & great people who work there. From the meat to the fish everything is always amazing especially their in house sauce that comes with a lot of the meat dishs!  Highly recommended. I have been to a bunch of Portuguese restaurants and for the food this is one of the best. Prices are very fair also. in the summer months the patio is also great to eat with friends.   I have been coming here for years & have brought many new people to this restaurant everybody is always amazed on how good the food is and they always end up coming back!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to the place since it opened the only thing that I can say is the food is good and it is not about presentation it is about the food. Service has improved and is always getting  better. This is not 5 star dining this is down to earth dining no bells or whistle just good food."}
{"text":"Great dinner with my hubby . Started with cod cakes, bbq chicken with chip fries and rice. Meal was delicious, our server was so sweet. We love this place, great food , no reservations required."}
{"text":"I'm giving it a 4 because my boyfriend swears by this place and thinks their bife a casa is amazing and authentic. He is Portuguese by the way. I ordered that dish and didn't think the same. I thought the sauce was too salty for my palate. The fries was good tho. The service was great - thank gosh my bf and his cousins can speak Portuguese!"}
{"text":"We were just passing in by, my bf spotted this place. I'm Portuguese he's not but we love Portuguese food. I was craving bife a casa. So we said why not, we sat down the place was empty was about 5 Saturday evening. The lady was nice. We got bread and butter very fresh. We got our big plates. So the menu says it's 10oz meat, covered in house chips. The chips were incredibly thin like lays chips. My bf didn't like that, I thought it was okay they gave you a lot even though, I still enjoyed it. I dug through the chips to finally get to the meat and it was little. It was thin and long. I cut into it took my first bite and was in love. It was very yummy I had no fat on my meat it was tender, not chewy or over done. I asked for medium well it was the most perfect piece of meet. I just wish there was more! We have big appetites this would have not filled us up in its own but we had gelato across the street after. We would come back it's our number 2 choice for bife a casa! Banaboia is number one still"}
{"text":"Made reservations and visited tonight with a group of 14, not 1 enjoyed their meal. After ordering we waiting 1 hour and 50 minutes for our food. What we got was an assortment of over cooked meals. When I say over cooked I mean the pork was jerky status!! Others had the steak which looked at though it had been microwaved and tasted freezer burned. The salad was drowned in vinegar and the clams were cold with a gelatine like sauce over them. All of our complaints were dismissed with apologies from the inattentive waitress . Needless to say I confident that no one from our group will be giving this place a 2nd chance."}
