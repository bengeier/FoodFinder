{"text":"Went there just after lunch time about 2:30 pm in July. Just a few chairs by the window, place looked dirty/unkempt. Food was nothing special - lots of noodles/rice, little meat, nothing to say about flavor, pricing average for Chinese fast food place.
Disappointing."}
{"text":"This is one of those unassuming Americanized Chinese food restaurants you wouldn't think has some of the best dishes around. I was introduced to this place by a friend way back in 2002 and have ever since ordered takeout when I'm in the area. What got me hooked was the flavor of the chicken wings sold here. No where else in the GTA will you find Chinese style chicken wings flavored this well. You can get them either regular or spicy. I recommend the latter. Pairing the chicken wings with the shrimp fried rice of special fried rice will leave your taste buds changed forever and has made me a loyal customer for the past 15 years."}
