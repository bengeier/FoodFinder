{"text":"Honestly, I wasn't impressed. The place itself is nice: the patio is gay boi heaven with lots of seating in the summer for people watchin'. There was a sufficient smattering of hunks in tanks and their older followers. I think that is the main draw here: the patio. It seems like the inside is very 'meh,' your typical converted Victorian home with the standard modern decor. My boyfriend and I went for Summerlicious and truthfully the food was good. I started with the caprese stack, had the streak frites for my main, and finished with the brownie. The price for the fixed menu itself seemed reasonable: $35. But seriously those portions were TINY. I mean the 'stack' literally had maybe 6 leaves. I mean, really!? Do I look like a bird? I need to EAT mofos. So while what was on the plate was tasty, there really wasn't much of it.  The steak was FATTY like, that's not ok. And the piece of meat was small. I understand that us Canadians may be used to big pieces of red meat, some the size of your arm, but this was just SMALL. 

The host was a nice enough guy but our Australian waiter was so abrupt. I mean like he was a bitchy queen. I saw him ordering around the bus boys, and demeaning the other staff. I mean, lighten up ol' boy. And while this is a relatively minor point I noticed that almost EVERY table they brought the wrong food to the wrong person. We were approached twice with someone else's food. None of the waiters deliver the food to their tables: they have the kitchen staff do this. And it seems they don't even tell them which table its supposed to go to because they just wander around aimlessly asking 'steak frites, anyone steak frites.' Like that is sosososo 'Applebee's' of them.

The bill was $140. I KNOW. FOR TWO PEOPLE. I really find that over-priced, especially considering it was during SUMMERLICIOUS! Like, it's supposed to be cheap. Only cheap bitches go out during summerlicious. The pitcher of sangria was $39!!! Honestly the one thing that is really really overpriced here is the liquor. You could've made that shit for $10 yourself. Not impressed. 

Won't be back. We'll try some over spots in the Village before coming back here."}
{"text":"Fuzion is kinda the new kid on the block at Church & Wellesley.
In the winter, it's your basic restaurant (which I haven't eaten at, so i can't comment on that). They book out their top floor for private parties; it holds about 50, standing, and is endorsed by promoters and scene-queens in the gayborhood.

But in the summer, damn girl, you get hot! Fuzion has a great wrap-around, garden like, corner lot patio with comfy couch seating and regular tables. They have a semi-covered, garden-like bar with quick bartenders and the overall feel is sort of like a higher end backyard party at your friend's Rosedale mansion.

It's dope as dope can be. A nice break from  the touristy booze cruise that can be the rest of the gay village."}
{"text":"Had a thoroughly good time at this lovely restaurant. I ordered the prix fixe dinner for $35 and had the best gazpacho I've had in years, exquisite scallops and a wonderful apple tart.  Don't miss this place."}
{"text":"Fun \"garden patio\" atmosphere with an equally fun lounge inside.

While my friends dined, we bathed in the warmth of a heat lamp and I drank a few too many negronis (gin + vermouth + Campari) over the course of the night. There was a hip birthday party happening on the other side of the patio at the same time, and a DJ playing for the couch-sitting masses on the second floor.

At $9 a cocktail, it's about par for this kind of place, but they do start to add up...

I was actually quite impressed with the service. Charming but not grating, they made a special effort to ensure we were comfortable and searched for more propane tanks when they kept running out!

One question I forgot to ask: They serve Fuzion wine as their house wine, but how exactly are the wine and the lounge related?"}
{"text":"Nice place on a summer evening either on the patio or at the bar.
Nice selection of Tapas & wine by the glass. One block East from Wellesley TTC Sation and one short block North."}
{"text":"I was here on a Friday night for dinner around 7.  The place was very quiet & may be because of this, the service was exceptional.  They had the 1$ oyster on Friday from 5-8, which I tried and was good for the price.  The portion size is good & adequate.  I ordered the lamb which was undercooked.  My friend had the Filet Mignon which was cooked properly.  Both main courses were very good. Didn't get to try any dessert."}
{"text":"I arrive and am greeted by a charming waiter who is looking for the hostess. He checks the computer and tells me my date has already arrived and is seated. Then, oddly he and another continue to search for the hostess for 5 minutes, then take my jacket and seat me at a table ALONE, telling me they'll find my date in a few minutes. I spy him across the room, sitting alone so I tell the waiter and move.  My man tells me he asked for the drink list 5 minutes ago, the water glasses are empty and he's been there 10minutes. I take a look at the menu (and realized this was not the place we had wanted to dine- I mixed up the Winterlicious menus somehow(!!) but decided to make the most of it- my date was awesome and I'm not cooking! 

Winterlicious Prix Fix...  
The 'Stuffed Risotto Balls with Buffalo Mozzarella Tomato Ragout & Salted Cucumber' appetizer was akin to a deep fried mozzarella stick, glamorized with bland rice rather than batter and sitting atop what tasted like pizza sauce from a can. 
I had the Seafood Paella as a main- the rice tasted like it was bathed in cheap chicken broth it was so salty, four clams, two mussels,  two shrimp and a scallop gave it some texture but I could not distinguish any flavour other than salt! I didn't finish it- and that's not my style!! 
Dessert, I got a trio of sorbets- electric orange colours, very very sweet orange, mango was pretty good and a third flavour I couldn't distinguish- and no one mentioned. 
The highlight of the evenings meal was a glass of NZ Sauvingon Blanc and my great date!"}
{"text":"Prettiest terrace! We were looking for nice outdoor terrace during Pride weekend to chill and people watch. Service was pretty good. Food was ok. My fish was pretty tasty. We had sangria for the table, it tasted like water-down wine. None of the drinks (mojito, ceasar, martini)  we ordered were any good."}
{"text":"As a person at the table seated next to us remarked part way through his entree, \"ohhhhh I get it! Fusion! They FUSE the different ingredients together!\" Yeah.

My partner and I went on a Sunday afternoon, and were pleasantly surprised to see they were still offering their summerlicious menu, even after the festival was over. This meant we could have a full meal for cheap! The standard menu was also offered, and I recall the prices not being too ridiculously expensive.
My entree was the lavendar-honey glazed cornish game hen. The chicken was yummy - cooked perfectly. But oh my, there was a lot happening on that plate. There was a polenta-goat cheese tower thing, and some creamed corn, and some sort of greens, and another sauce/reduction... and for some inexplicable reason, roasted cashews just thrown on top. Not a garnish, but not exactly a part of the dish either... just there. Sitting on top. So, I guess they fused the cashews with the chicken? I don't know. 
This isn't really the type of cuisine I usually go for, as I prefer simple food. I'm not opposed to experiencing new flavours and unique presentations, but I don't like throwing ingredients together just for the sake of it. I'm basing this off of just one meal, so I'm not sure if all their dishes are like this. The quality was certainly there, and I definitely enjoyed my meal, but it just seemed like it was trying too hard.

{"text":"I finally made it to this spot which is always popping up on the short list of places with patios on Church street to meet people, that isn't a pub.  I went with a large group for Summerlicious 2010.  I figured with most of the bad reviews involving it costing too much, I was in a good position to get a deal with the prix fixe.  Ahhhh, sadly, they cut the portion sizes so much as to make it similar to the $35 one might spend on a main on a regular night.  I must admit the appetizer I had involved grilled calamari and was my best experience with the sea animal to date. It wasn't battered and fried, but nicely tender and well-seasoned.  
This IS one of those places where salt and pepper are off the table, because they know exactly how much you want on your food, or will bring round the pepper mill when they remember. 
The sangria was decent, but not cold enough for a hot night on the patio and too sweet.  
My Summerlicious main was gnocci. Almost no toppings, buttery, little tomato garnish, but by the end I was still hungry. Gnocci costs like $5 at most, if you are going to serve the vegetarians tiny portions and the meat eaters whole birds, I am going to feel short-changed.  
So, yes it's uber-expensive and maybe if you have a bird's appetite, you'll be impressed, but this is sadly no value."}
{"text":"I'm a stranger to high class dining. I'd admit, I love Taco Hell. The only reason why I dined at this swank place is because I got gift cards for it. 
We got seated on the patio which is really nice. Our server was good although I'm sure he figured we were out of place. The gift cards at the end probably confirmed his opinion. I felt like I was giving a coupon.
We both ordered a salad. I went for the one without beets as I'm not particularly fond of beets (especially after my co-worker told me of her experience over-dosing on them and throwing up. Note, too many beets will guarantee a puke fest).
My salad had some foreign-looking greens, pomegranate and what I think was an avocado paste. A little on the bland side. My main dish was asparagus sheep's milk gnocchi. That was pretty awesome. It melted in my mouth. The thin broth sauce was a touch too salty (for me to say that says a lot since I'm a salt-fiend. I'm surprise my blood pressure isn't through the roof). 
My partner and I had gnocchi in Venice and it tasted like scario-oh's so this was a real treat. I haven't had much gnocchi in my life but this had restored my faith in it!
My partner had the arctic char which he said was really delicious. Our meal (a bottle of sparkling water, two salads and two mains) came to $108 with tip & tax. Pretty pricey considering we didn't even order booze or dessert. If you driveway is paved in gold though, then it's no skin off your back but for cheapos like us, once we use up the other half of our gift cards, we'll probably go back to dining at Taco Hell (okay, maybe Chinos Locos since there's no Taco Hell near us)."}
{"text":"Fuzion \"Resto-Lounge and Garden\" gets its 4 star reviews from 2 things - atmosphere and service. As far as design goes, the restaurant... sorry \"resto-lounge and garden\", is great. They have a nice big outdoor patio for people to enjoy in the summer. It has a feeling of being removed from the street (even though it's in the 'gay ghetto'). I've been at the restaurant a couple times and each time the service has been excellent. The staff are friendly, outgoing and attentive.   

The only downside to this place, and it's a big one, is the food. The menu is overpriced and pretentious. Take for example the 'milk-fed (from Quebec), apricot and hazelnut stuffed, chocolate-chile glazed pork tenderloin with cream sauce' for 27 bucks. There's a lot happening in that dish and it just screams pretentious. The meal was good, but so is the food at the other restaurants on church street that offer similar meals for $5-$10 less. The overpriced rule applies to the alcohol as well. The martinis were weak and with an $8.50 price tag that's really disappointing. Someone reviewed this place as fine dining and I disagree; a big-worded menu and overpriced food is not fine dining."}
{"text":"Pretentious? check.
overpriced? check.
tasty small portions? check.

It's like this place went through restaurant makeover and made everything into small portions on square plates.
Yes the lounge is nice to sit in.  And the service is above average nice (not making you feel rushed at all while still being attentive).  
But yeah.. it feels like an inside out club when I have to pay 10-15 per drink and 15-20 for 3 creatively placed cocktail wienies on a square plate.

I'm not going to say this is an outrageous rip, but it meets almost none of the requirements of what I look for in an easy weekend place for dining and wining."}
{"text":"The food was actually surprisingly pretty good, they have a nice patio but it was hideous inside. ok service, bad decor, bad ambience. I probably would go back and eat outside on the patio when it gets warmer, especially since I get 30% off my meal via diningdatenight.com"}
{"text":"Went for Winterlicious - and this is what i summed up from my experience there:

Food - small quantities, good presentation, overpriced, lacked pizzazz. 
Service - host very friendly, server not so friendly and had memory loss. 
Ambience - very nice, well furnished and good mood lighting."}
{"text":"First of all.. let me just say.. that i've eaten in more than my share of \"bougie, upscale\" establishments... and this was my first time in Toronto.. and I was less than impressed w/ the service here.

It started with confusion...we were greeted by a host who told us that our wait would be 10-15 minutes. Then a man came up.. smugly looked around and told us we would have no longer than 5 minutes. Not sure if this was an effort to make us stay... even though we were on vacation.. and clearly had no where else we really wanted to go. Anyway.. my friend and I ordered drinks... they told us our table was ready.. and we were assured the drinks would be brought over to our table...our drinks arrived at our table... about 15 minutes later along with our bill for the drinks.. now i dont know what type of restaurant this is.. but I think the drinks could have been added to our tab.. none the less my friend paid for the drinks. 

It took about 10-15 minutes for us to even be greeted by our waitress...Who came over and told us that the there were no specials.. because the kitchen \"just didn't feel like having any\" ... me and my friend were stunned w/ the rudeness.. I mean its ok if you just omit specials.. that's fine.. but don't tell us that the kitchen just doesn't feel like making them.. how ridiculous! Then she went on to tell us that the food would take at least 45 minutes to come out... this is fine.. I understand i've worked in restaurants when I was in college.. and sometimes the kitchen gets back upped.. I realized this and would not tip any less because the food took along time.. it was the service that was awful.

we placed our orders... and asked for some water to go with our cocktails and told the waitress we would order some wine later most likely... we were a party of two... and indicating to her that we were really going to be no hassle... we were ok w/ the wait for food.

She then ignored us... never brought us over our water... and what was worse didn't even really look busy while we were waiting.. she finally came over after we asked her again for waters... and gave us.. a tiny snifter of water each... it was ridiculous.. by doing this she was really just creating more work for herself... she could have at least half filled the glasses.. but sounding like a pessimist they were half empty. We ordered our wine when she brought over the glasses of water...

and waited.. and waited.. and waited... finally when we saw her walk by again... we got her attention and asked if she remember the wine we had ordered... she said \"what do u think I would forget..\" (clearly she did) it took her about 10-15 minutes to bring us over our wine... finally she delivered it.. at this point my friend just asked her to leave a bottle of water on the table... since she was clearly not going to do anything.

our food came out we hadn't even taken a bite and she offered some fresh ground pepper and asked how it was. We said it looked fine.  

the food was surprisingly ok.. for the rancid service we had had so far...during our meal.. she walked over to her table next to us... proceeded to count the money from the bill.. and click her tongue and roll her eyes... my friend and I were so disgusted.. her actions were not professional in any respect... we decided then.. that she was not getting a very good tip from us either... 

we had to ask someone else to get our waitress with our bill.. because we hadn't seen her again in some time... she came over w/ the check.. and ran our cards at the table... she sat down next to us.. and said I think I deserve a rest after that... 

ok honestly.. if the waitress took on other tables and could handle it fine... but when she was outside.. it didn't even look like she was running around doing anything.. this was just the worst service I had ever seen.. as a former waiter.. I still have had terrible service and still left a 20% tip.. but this waitress.. did not deserve it at all.. we left her a 10% tip... it had to be the worrrrrrrsssst restaurant experience I've ever had.. or at least I hope I'll ever have."}
{"text":"Went here for Summerlicious in 2007 or 2008, can't remember. They have a great patio. Good presentation. Can't really remember what I had but I remember enjoying it very much. The main course was bison, and I still think about it sometimes. Fuzion is definitely one of the classier joints on Church Street. Service was friendly. Always looks like a great patio for classy cocktails and martinis at night, but my friends don't like fancy places and would rather go to the dyve bars surrounding it. I'd like to come by in the evening and try out the night life as I have been thoroughly disappointed with Slacks and Voglie."}
{"text":"Fuzion offers a little something called \"Martinis and Manicures\" every Wednesday, Thursday and Friday evening. While I didn't eat at Fuzion, I did (*cough* make the mistake) come for a manicure and drink with a friend, and boy... was that a special experience. 

We decided to come after a FabFind popped up for this deal. It was $18, but they have listed as $40 regular price (I can't imagine someone paying for this, how disappointing would that be!!) So, I was pretty excited for this deal, as it seemed like a great idea, AND we got to watch Sex and The City episodes while we got our nails done. However, it didn't even close to live up to my expectations. 

To start, we showed up to our appointment only to find out that the manicurist was double booked, and that we should come back in half hour... not a great start. When we returned, I quickly realized this wasn't going to be the manicure from my dreams. First of all, I never saw her clean the tools from the previous group, nor did I see cleaning supplies. She did the manicure on a pillow (no tables) and it literally took less than 10 minutes. There was a bit of filing (round on one hand, square on the other, great!), a bit of cuticle treatment, and then a coat of polish and a top coat. It was to the point that when she finished I said \"You're... done?\" and yes, she was. 

My friend was up next, and I can say for certain that the tools were not cleaned. Also, my friend was CUT by the tools, that weren't clean!! AGHHH!! Worst thing ever!! (She had poked me, but didn't break the skin!) She had a similar (lack luster) experience. 

When we left the dimly lit restaurant (maybe that was the problem) we realized that our nail polish was uneven and bubbly, and all over our fingers as well as our nails. The moral of this story is, if you want to get a manicure, I could probably do a better job if I was drunk. 

So Fuzion, maybe scrap this plan and go back to serving food."}
{"text":"The patio seating was nice. The arctic char was a bit dry. The potatoes were undercooked. The lychee drink was stiff.  No smile on the waiters. It was packed during pride week (or because it was Canada day) but fun crowds."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch. Great Caesars, slow service. My friend was about to chew his arm off he was so hungry. It took almost an hour for the food to come and the order was by no means difficult. 
I heard it closed and is re opening as a pub."}
{"text":"Despite not so great reviews, me and two of my friends decided to try Fuzion out for Winterlicious. The place itself is small, looks like the inside of a house. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that the service was absolutely wonderful. Our server came to our table right away and checked up on us several times during our meal. My friend ordered the tuna tacos, and didn't realize it came with ham. She doesn't eat ham and the manager saw her picking it out of the tacos. He asked what was wrong and our server came to our table as well and apologized for not letting us know about the ham (even though it was our fault for not reading the menu properly). He offered to take it back and get a new order made with no ham, and we took him up on the offer. WHile we waited for the new meal, another server came and offered us a round of shots on the house. The risotto balls were amazing. Unfortunately the restaurant had run out of one of the dessert options (nutella pie) which was dissappointing. The food was good, but the service was excellent."}
