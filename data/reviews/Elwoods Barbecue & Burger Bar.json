{"text":"Shitty food, service and management. The one decent thing on the menu isn't even BBQ.. If you decide to go to this \"restaurant\" get the wings but be prepared to wait at least 20 minutes after you order them cause the kitchen has no concept of time. Not sure how this place is even staying open. Both times I've been the place is dead as a door nail."}
{"text":"The BBQ pork was good, but everything else was lacking, including the service. This was our second bad experience in the past 2 visits. Big fan of the joint in the past, but there are menu changes along with personnel. Collard greens weren't cooked. The okra fries taste mainly like breading. Lots of customers along with us, were complaining about excessive smoke coming from the cookers."}
{"text":"Terrible service.  The cook as well as the cashier had a verbal ddispute in front of us. Our order was wrong, they never offered to fix it, they only voided it without even asking. Although I wouldn't have wanted it fixed as pissed as the cook was as soon as we arrived. First things first the food was soggy. their version of correcting my order was hand picking out what was wrong.  It's sad to say, because a year ago Elwood's was awesome, boy has it changed for the very worse. Don't waste your money here folks.  Sincerely,    one pissed off customer."}
{"text":"The best BBQ in the Ballantyne area.  I love the ribs."}
{"text":"Pros: food was good. Nice clean place w easy parking. Cons: Slow service...food was ready and sitting on the counter for almost 5 minutes before waitress brought it.  Never checked back w us to see if we needed anything or refill drinks.  And music too loud."}
{"text":"Enjoyed lunch with a coworker here today. Great atmosphere with lots of tvs, and the wings were decent. I'll bet this is a good place to go on a Thursday or Monday night to watch football and have a few beers. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I hate to say it but the WORST service I have had in a LONG time!  It's obvious that the manager/owners have no idea how to treat a customer and it trickles down to the line staff!  The pulled pork plate was ok, at least eatable,not great nothing to brag about certainly.  The soda was flat.  Nobody there cared and it showed!  I can't see going back-EVER"}
{"text":"Elwood's is always a regular stop for me in the Ballantyne area.  Whenever I'm craving a burger, this is the place I must go! I'm also currently obsessed with their fried okra and Barbalo wings! I went with some friends this pass Sunday and found Elwood's to be an awesome spot to watch the NFL and college games.  They have added a ton of t.v.'s so you can see the action from wherever you are sitting.  I continue to highly recommend them!"}
{"text":"Carly is awesome, as well as, the BBQ! I recommend the Carolina Mojito and BBQ sandwich with the Parmesan Tots."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed. I was really hoping for a great new place. I ordered the brisket and it was 50% fat and tough as nails. My wife ordered the burnt ends and it was tender, but 50% of it was a thick fat layer."}
{"text":"We ate there for a late lunch and both got sick.  We asked for brisket, but they said they were out.  My friend had the burnt ends sandwich, which turned out to be globs of fat.  I got the bbq pulled pork sandwich.  For sides we got the fried okra and the sweet potato casserole.  We liked the honey bourbon bbq sauce, but I think we just were not used to that much greasy food.  We ate at Midwoods BBQ twice and didn't feel sick afterwards.  I thought the pork had a funny, slightly rancid smell to it, but thought it was just part of the bbq.  Something was bad and the place was empty.  I didn't want to write anything but thought I should warn others.  I don't like writing negative reviews.  We both were burping grease the rest of the night..."}
{"text":"Just got a take-out order and was so disappointed. We asked for the bbq sauce when we placed the order and if my husband hadn't checked we would have had no sauce as it was not included. The amount of pulled pork for the $13 entree was a joke. The sauces left much to be desired - one was nothing but vinegar and the other tasted like jarred tomato sauce! The jalapeño cornbread was hard as a rock, the potato salad was by far the worst Ive ever had...we couldn't even eat it. The potato salad had zero flavor and was so dry it was crumbling when you tried to scoop it. Also, there was a free order of the fried pickles attached to the Yelp app but I found out AFTER we ordered them that the offer was for a half order.  This was a complete waste of money!"}
{"text":"Went on a Monday night for first time. Five other tables other than us (2 adults/2 kids). Menu looked great and decent beer selection.  Server was nice and gave recommendations but forgot multiple requests. Kids meals were just ok. Apple sauce killed with cinnamon. Wife got pork plate with mac and cheese and slaw. Granted it's pulled pork shoulder, but was about 75 fat. I ordered the brisket sandwich with onion rings. Brisket was well flavored, but a bit dry and tough.  The one item that was really good were the onion rings.  Overall, food was well below expectations and it took much much longer to get our food given how empty the restaurant was. Very disappointing as the menu sounded great and very convenient to where we live. Really wanted to like it but I won't bother going back unless they get a kitchen staff that can deliver on the promise of a superb menu...or if I crave those onion rings and a couple cold beers."}
{"text":"Went to Elwood's tonight with my wife after not going for several months. We received a flyer in the mail and it said new management and new menu so we figured we'd give it another chance....and we're so glad we did. It's honestly like night and day. It is simply amazing now. The meat tastes fresher and you can taste the smokiness. The hush puppies don't taste like they were frozen. Wings are amazing. And is swear that even the sweet tea tastes better than before. What made it even better was that the wait staff is all new and our waitress was a sweetheart, the owner came over and thanked us for coming and was telling us about the improvements they have made and what's in store. We can't wait for live music!! You can really tell that the owner cares about the restaurant and the people that come in. All in all a great experience. I usually don't write yelp reviews, but I believe in 2nd chances and everyone should give Elwood's another shot..you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Greens and slaw were excellent and atmosphere is cool.  Would not recommend the pulled pork......looked like it sat our for a while under a heat lamp and had a strange crust on top.  I'll give it another chance for the ribs though"}
{"text":"Went to Elwood's a couple weeks ago in search of Carolina BBQ.  I had heard some great reviews about this place from coworkers, so I figured I would give it a try.  When we first got there, the restaurant was rather empty - yet, we were sat right in front of the door, which I thought was a little awkward. Not only that, but they continued to seat people in the tables right next to us.  You would think that they would spread people out so that they are not right on top of another.  Anyway - on to the food... I got a pulled pork sandwich, fries, and hushpuppies.  I'm used to Eastern style BBQ. This was far from it.  Dry, tasteless, and even the vinegar based sauce they had couldn't save it.  Not impressed.  Hushpuppies were way too fried and just heavy. I felt like I needed 4 gulps of water per bite.  Not sure if the recommendations I heard were from people who don't like the eastern style BBQ, but I think I'll pass on this restaurant from now on."}
{"text":"this was a totally disappointing experience.  I wasn't expecting to eat out of paper baskets with so-so plastic utensils.  My friend ordered the pork plate with onion rings and slaw.  There was a puddle of grease in the bottom of the basket under the pork, which had no flavor, as did the slaw.  She couldn't find the onions in the onion rings.  They were very greasy also.  I ordered 1/4 bbq chicken, baked beans and green beans.  The chicken breast I was served was very small even with the bone in and difficult to cut with the plastic knife.  It was cooked quite well but very greasy.  The baked beans were acceptable but the green beans tasted out of a can.  We won't be going again nor referring our friends."}
{"text":"There have been stories in the news lately about business owners vilifying their unhappy customers on social networks after their establishment received negative reviews. In light of that textbook example of how NOT to do business,  I'm happy to say that Elwood's management sets a perfect example of how you SHOULD do business.  After my first, lackluster review of Elwood's, and particularly of their pork barbecue, Justin - the owner of Elwood's reached out to me. He let me know they had reworked some of their menu items, including how they hold the pork after it's cooked, so that it retains its flavor better. He offered to send me a gift certificate to try out the restaurant again. I hung onto the certificate over the holidays and my husband and I managed to get in to give Elwood's a second try last Thursday.  I ordered the pulled pork platter, along with hush puppies and macaroni and cheese. As we waited, someone came by with some cornbread for us, which I hadn't been able to try on my first visit. It's good, but a little cakey and a bit messy because it falls apart so easily.  Once our food arrived, I couldn't wait to dig into the pork. Justin wasn't lying, the pork really IS really good now. It had a nice smokey flavor to it, which was exactly what I was missing before. It was substantially improved over the pork I had the first time. My husband ordered the potato wedges and green beans along with brisket (I think, I wasn't looking over at his plate much because I was so busy with my own). We both really enjoyed our meal.  If Yelp allowed for 4.5 stars, I'd grant it to Elwood's. I enjoyed my meal and I will be back. Equally as impressive as the food improvements however, are the people who run and staff this restaurant. They are a class act."}
{"text":"Walked in to elwoods at ten till one on a Saturday afternoon. There were about four tables eating and two other tables walked in around the same time as my family. We ordered and our food came out 40 min latter, for a grilled cheese sandwich, two scrambled eggs and a Buffalo chicken wrap. The grilled cheese was burnt and cold, the eggs were extremely cold along with everything on the plate and my wife's chicken wrap she took three bites and was done. The waitresses never asked how the food was and didn't come back until I had to Flagg her down for the check. We will not go back!!! Poor food and even worse service."}
{"text":"Very attentive service but the burgers and ribs are mediocre at best. Kids eat free on Tuesdays? and easy parking.  But these are the only redeeming qualities.  Place has a very generic, fast food feel. The bar area looks like an afterthought. Probably one of worst rack of \"ribs\" I have had.  The sauce is bland, the meat is over cooked.  My daughters burger was a step below Burger King. A bad thing for a restaurant with \"burgers\" and \"ribs\" in its name.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"Better than I expected, me being a BBQ aficionado LOL (thats right kids it's the word for the day). I had the brisket and it was really good, no knife required to cut the meat. Their portions were surprisingly big for the price too. The one or two things that I didn't really care too much for was the mac and cheese and the dip your own sauce out of the bucket. I would think that they could have the different sauces in bottles rather than buffet style. Other than that the wait staff were excellent and came by and checked on us several times."}
{"text":"we went for ribs and were a bit disappointed. not terrible but def not the \"best in town\" as advertised and trumped up. cole slaw was boring. wings truly average.  service was pretty good and the employees tried like heck to convince you the food was special but they simply could not overcome the reality of the actual product."}
{"text":"Service was friendly, we were greeted nicely at the door. Pulled pork was dissapointing and the worst thing of all is the Goyurt squeeze yogurt that was given to my daughters with their kids meals was expired. No manager came over to apologize just another server saying that they looked and they all have the same date so they were all expired.  That is disgusting that they don't have a process in place to check those things. Turned me off to any future visits."}
{"text":"Elwood's has a relaxed atmosphere & sumptuous BBQ. The food tastes as good as they smell when you walk inside. I like their pork BBQ & hush puppies with honey butter. The drinks are tasty--I like the John Daly, sweet tea vodka."}
{"text":"Three (and a 1/2) of us went on a  Living Social deal on a rainy Saturday afternoon.  We gorged on brisket, pulled pork, chicken wings, and 1/2 chicken...with fried pickles (done just how I like 'em - crispy!), coleslaw, and some outrageous onion rings.  The sauces are delish - my favorite being the vinegar-based.    Elwood's is close to home, so we will go often to feed on some delish barbecue.  The service was impeccable.  Greeted at the door, menu explained, order taken promptly...and several check-ins throughout the meal.  Definitely on the ball.    I think Elwood's is a winner, winner, barbecue dinner!  (and lunch...and possibly to--go breakfast the next morning...)"}
{"text":"My brother lives in Hawaii and everytime he makes it to Charlotte I make sure I take him to Elwoods for some Barbecue. I am from Robeson County and we make homemade fresh barbecue every summer. Since I now live in the city limits and can't string up and bbq my own piggy Elwoods is as close as I can get to home. Its great! The sides are always good, I mean really, who has collard greens as a side and they're actually GOOD!!  I have never had any customer service issues and my food has always been hot, fresh and really tasty. Thanks and I will continue to visit!"}
{"text":"For me, this is the best burger in Charlotte.  Had the Double Don.  Woman I was dining with summed it up best when she left one bite on her plate:  I don't want to eat the last bite because I don't want it to be over.\" Good friendly service, decent prices.  Would eat there more if I found myself in the area more."}
{"text":"Went for the first time last weekend.  Our service was slow, but our food was pretty good.  We ordered the roasted red pepper pimento cheese to start and it was pretty tasty.  My veggie burger was customizable and very good, with fresh jalepenos and sautéed mushrooms and onions and the house made parmesan tator tots were delish!  The Mr. ordered brisket sandwich which he said was a touch on the dry side but tasty nonetheless and his slaw and beans were both tasty.  Music was on point, thanks to Nick Shaw and the beers were cold (decent draft selection too).  Just wish the server was a little more timely.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Very pleased. Service was very good, food awesome and fresh and priced well. I had fried chicken sandwich, hash brown casserole. Mac n cheese was OK, I have had better. To runny. For sure will return"}
{"text":"OK folks in Pineville, Indian Land, and Fort Mill, we got us a real bonified BBQ joint here! We need to step up and support Elwoods because we only have this and 521 BBQ that serve BBQ this good! I have to admit I was somewhat leary about going there because I had called ahead and they do not havr chopped BBQ and to me, that is a North Carolina staple. We did however have coupons for a free BBQ sandwich out of the ValPak envelope everyone in our neighborhood gets in the mail and, by God, I was not gonna let a FREE BBQ sandwich go to waste!    The restaurant is so clean and modern looking and yet feels friendls. You place your order at a counter when you come in and they are all so friendly & helpful! I wanted to substitute french fries for their JoJo potato wedges and they said no problemo! You can see all the food being cooked right there behind the counter, it was cool! You then get your own drinks and condiments and find yourself a table. They bring your food to ya and the ladies are always refiilling your drinks and they bring you complimentary cornbread while you wait. We did not really like the crnbread. It was dry and way too sweet, almost like a cake. My Mom said if you put icing on it it would be a great birthday cake! Not what I want my cornbread to taste like.    Now for the food. The pulled pork was spectactular, especially for these parts. It had a deep smokey flavor and was pulled fined and almost looked like chopped BBQ. The bun my sandwich came on was so fresh and had to be made locally and it just melted in your mouth! Muy Delicioso!! We all shared a chicken dinner too and it was so good! They fry all the foods in peanut oil and that always gives foods a nice crisp, crunch. The hushpuppies were good but once again a little too sweet for us. We are more used to an oniony, more cornbready pup. They did however give ya alot of them for two bucks. The fries are another story though. I was so devastated because they were so greasy and very limp. I like mine crispy and soft inside. These are not those kind of fries and I LOVE good fries! I can only hope they'll go to a more traditional crispy fry to accentuate the BBQ! Other sides they serve are hashbrown casserole, mac-n-cheese, baked beans, collard greens, cole slaw, onion rings, and those aforementioned JoJo potato wedges I saw another person with one of their Philly cheesesteak sandwiches and it looked delicious and boy was it HUGE. It looked worth the 7.99 they are charging for it!    That leads me to my last topic, prices. We found them to be somewhat high. I don't spend 10 dollars at lunch often and it looks like that is easily what you'd have to spend for lunch. All the side orders are 2 bucks a pop and drinks are 1.79. Small order of ribs 10.99, large- 18.99. half chicken order- 8.99 BBQ plate-8.99 beef brisket-8.99pulled BBQ chicken-8.29 Create your owm burger-5.59 create your own Doulbe Don(?) burger- 6.59    So that's Elwoods according to our visit. Well definitely going back. We only wish we could afford to eat there more. Bottom line. it's good BBQ and that's enough for me!"}
{"text":"I had a really good experience at Elwoods the service was top notch. They even brought around some free cornbread.  I had one of the best burgers I've ever had around town and the fries were fresh and delicious.  My coworker and together sampled all the yummy sauce and we both frowned when are burgers were gone.  I literally didn't want to take my last bite because I was so sad it was going to be gone.  To bad there isn't an Elwoods closer to where I live but anytime I am out this way they will definitely be receiving my business."}
{"text":"I want to start by saying I went to Elwood's tonight for the second time with plans to make this a new regular for my wife and I . We had been to Elwood's once b4 about a month back and the food was good. I checked the place out online b4 going tonight and found the ownership had changed and there was a 20% off coupon on the web sight and the new menu stated that all sides were hand made fresh. I'm not one to normally complain and was still very kind to my waitress. I still hope this criticism is taken constructive. I ordered the brisket  with onion rings and green beans. I have to tell you the brisket was terribly dry. I have had way better brisket from Sams out of a package pre cooked. The onion rings were almost round balls of dough and I could only eat one, they were terrible. The green beans did not tast like green beans they tasted like someone had poured liquid smoke flavor in them. Needless to say I took one bite and was done. My wife ordered the garlic Parmesan wings and she could only eat 3 of those which did not look or taste like garlic Parmesan at all.  This restaurant has defiantly not gotten better with new owners but just the opposite. Our service was good and waitress was very kind. The beer was good to.  I would love to see this place improve and succeed. I live close to here and it's nice to have good atmosphere and food in the same place. I don't recommend this place for now maybe in the future."}
{"text":"The wait staff is what kept me from giving 4 stars. The food is pretty good, but other local BBQ places can beat it by a bit. The hushpuppies are tasty though as is the mac and cheese. The waitress seemed less than pleased to wait on us leaving us at a table without beverages for nearly 10 minutes and empty glasses throughout the meal."}
{"text":"When you're a Barbecue and Burger Bar, how can you go wrong? My fiance got the ribs and the sweet tater tots. Both were delicious. I ordered the BBQ sandwich with a side of onion rings. The onion rings were very thin, which isn't my favorite style, but for $5, I can't ask for much more. Also they gave us cornbread. I will definitely be going back sometime."}
{"text":"Order the Elwoood Ribs w/ side of collard greens, mac and cheese & side salad. Using the 20% off coupon that came on Yelp. Omg who would have thought I could get this good of barbeque on Balyntyne.,. The food was fantastic.. the ribs were so tender meat fell off the bone..I ate my ribs with a fork got all the meat off..The mac and cheese was so good & creamy w/ nice crunch topping on it...I was very impressed with the Collard greens they were cooked to perfection had a little spice kick to them. I'm so glad I came to this place over Sticky Fingers."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I came just in time for happy hour today.  We ordered the nachos which were half price.  They were delicious! The plate was piled high with toasted tortilla chips topped with a generous amount toppings. I highly recommend using one of the many in house BBQ sauces as a zesty addition to anything you order.  On too of the great food we received great service. Our bartender was A.J. who was very accommodating with our drinks and we also enjoyed quite the stimulating fantasy football convo along with Marcy and the manger, Brian. Overall.....top notch services, food, and experience!!"}
{"text":"OK...  so after hearing some better things about this place, I decided to give it another serious shot.  I went with a coworker during our lunch break, and was sincerely impressed by the overall experience.  It wasn't just that the food seemed better (pulled pork actually had flavor this time, and wasn't dry!).  The service was better than in the past also, with our wait time for the food to come out being less than 5 minutes.   Good job Elwoods, keep it up!"}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place. Very cute atmosphere. And as I am originally from Chicago, I loved the Elwood factor. However, when it got down to the food, it was just like the Blues Brothers dry white toast, minus the four fried chickens.  The offerings of Barbecue sauce is extremely limiting. And the main sauce tasted not more than ketchup to my pallete. I asked if they had any spicier sauce or a way to kick up the heat. Server had nothing. I guess I am used to Texas, Chicago and California BBQ which always has a hot option. Dickeys, Famous Daves, and Kinders all have hot sauces. Big fail in Elwood's court.  Homemade mac and cheese is a big gross out when it is spooned into a container and obviously reheated in a microwave. And I had to think twice of whether the pulled pork was pork or brisket. Way too dry for pulled pork.  Will be checking out other Charlotte BBQ joints. This one off the list."}
{"text":"Ate at Elwood's again this evening.  Only one change... rather than ordering at the counter, you are now seated and served at a table.  Great service! Great BBQ, excellent sides, prices are reasonable... and still, the fried pickle appetizer is a must for us!"}
{"text":"Been a few months since I have been there but really liked it.  The collard greens were awesome and the beef briscuit was as good as I have had in  NC."}
{"text":"Went here twice because we had living social deals.  The first time I was not at all impressed.  I got the pulled pork with hush puppies and onion rings.  The pork had a good smoky taste but was pretty fatty. The hush puppies were overcooked, but the onion rings were good. They give you \"corn bread\" but its very sweet and more like cake, which my wife loved.     The second time I went, I got the pulled pork again and it had no noticeable fat.  It had the same smoky flavor and was pretty moist.  Much better this time.  This time my sides were potato wedges and onion rings.  The potato wedges were not done, but the onion rings were good again.  My wife got the slaw, which was very good and complimented the pulled pork perfectly.  She also got the hash brown casserole, but the potatoes were not cooked fully either.  All in all it was a decent meal, but nothing to write home about.  8/15 After my first review, management responded and ask that I give it another chance, so I did yesterday.  I must say both my wife and I really enjoyed our meals as we both cleaned our plates.  All of our sides were better this time, although we stayed away from the potato wedges."}
{"text":"We really liked the wings and pulled pork. The hushpuppies and fried pickles were also great. They seem to have a few more events since it came under new management, which is nice for the locals. To top it all off, the service was outstanding!"}
{"text":"This place is a joke. When I drove up at first I thought it was closed for the night as all the chairs were up on the tables. Then I saw a couple being seated so went in to check it out for myself. I'm sorry I did.  I was immediately told they were out of most everything: pulled pork, wings, chicken,  plus a whole list of other stuff I can't remember. I asked if they still had brisket  (yes) and burnt-ends (yes) so decided to stay. Looked through the menu then ordered a burnt-ends sandwich and specifically said to put the horseradish sauce on the side.  About 15 minutes later the waitress brings me the sandwich. First thing I notice is that the bread is two different thicknesses. One regular slice and one heel, and the heel slice is about a third as thick as the other. And as I lift up the bread I see the meat slathered in the sauce I had asked be put on the side. I called the waitress back and reminded them what I had ordered. She turned around and left without saying a word, nor taking the sandwich away.  She gets into a deep discussion with another waitress and a guy behind the counter I assume was the cook. Another 5 minutes go by then she comes to tell me that the cook made a mistake by putting the sauce on the sandwich, but she can't give me another sandwich because now they're all out of bread. I left. I have no idea if their food is good or not but this was such a crappy experience I doubt I'll ever go back to find out."}
{"text":"Went here for a work lunch because a colleague had posted coupons (buy one entree, get one free) in the break room. The positives are the service and the BBQ sauces, as well as the variety of meats (ribs, pulled pork, brisket, burnt ends).  The negatives are the taste of the meat, taste of the sides, and small size of the cornbread side (looks like a miniature muffin, but dry and tasteless).  I tried the burnt ends platter.  For $17, I got a sizable portion of meat; however, nearly half was fat.  The sides I tried (collard greens, loaded mashed potatoes) were bland and small.  As mentioned, sauces were good, but a BBQ joint lives and dies based on quality of meat.  Elwood's is on the lower end of the spectrum for taste and quality of its BBQ meats."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like it but it just wasn't that good.   Great service, lots of TVs and a good beer selection just didn't make up for the \"average\" food.   We pretty much sampled everything and here are the highlight and lowlights: Ribs were excellent and if I'm back I will order a full rack. Wings were good if you like them smoked and grilled.  I did but my finicky 9 year old didn't.  The pulled pork was better than average and included lots of yummy bark. The brisket was tender but VERY dry.   Both the onion rings and hush puppies were bland and greasy. Green beans, red slaw and fries were all boring.  Good place to take the family or friends on game night but if you are looking for better than average bbq and sides  I suggest you keep looking."}
{"text":"Stopped in to try the burnt ends. Delish! A ton of food for the value. Also scored the half plate of fried pickles through the yelp offer. Those were good at first, but after awhile, it's just too much oil to consume."}
{"text":"Really good pulled pork and wings. Try the signature Elwood sauce."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot for some delicious BBQ.  Service was prompt and friendly.  Kansas City Burnt Ends Meal was not a disappointment!!"}
{"text":"I've wanted to go to Elwood's since it opened and today we finally had the chance - we sneaked out for lunch.   Atmosphere-wise Elwoods is a hybrid quick service/sitdown restaurant plus a bar. Decor is modern with some bbq/western items. Not great, not bad but not the reason to go. The reason to go here is the BBQ.  We ordered the large salad with smoked chicken and the pulled pork platter, sides included Collard Greens, baked beans and hushpuppies. There are three sauces available, all on the side: the Elwood (which is this hybrid vinegar sauce and very good), the traditional (tastes like bullseye) and the vinegar (old school NC). While I didn't try the salad it got thumbs up from my wife. The pulled pork is very good, juicy, just a bit of bark, and good solid chunks. The beans were ok (and you could see they actually cooked them with pork) but the star was the collard greens, peppery, smokey, excellent! Hushpuppies were also good - fresh from the fryer.   On a sidenote the cornbread is different, not dense at all but light and fluffy like a homemade cake. It's fairly tasty but not if you are a traditionalist.  Overall this is a solid spot and I'll be back."}
{"text":"Used the 20% off coupon from Yelp. Now onto the food...   I agree with David S... if you live on the south side of Charlotte, by Ballantyne, then we FINALLY have a real BBQ joint. We went there on Sat night ordered to go. When we brought it home, no one was disappointed.   We all had the BBQ pork. the Ellwood sauce is really good. The beans, the mac n cheese and the hashbrown casserole were great as well.  Now granted it's not as good as some places in the mountains, but it's real darn close.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"This was my third time visiting Elwood's, and I must say that this is quickly becoming one of my \"go-to\" restaurants in South Charlotte, as they have consistently provided friendly service and great tasting food at a reasonable price, so what more can you ask for!  They recently started testing sit down service in the evenings, and I must say that this was a nice touch, as it made for a more relaxed experience vs the typical order at the counter process that seems to work well for a mid-day lunch, but doesn't feel as natural for an evening dinner out on a Friday night.  The service was very attentive, as we had a party of ten and everything went off without a hitch.  Drinks were refilled consistently without having to ask, and at no point during the meal did we have to do the \"waitress search\" which is far too common in many restaurants.  You know, the whole \"looking around the place wondering where in the heck did your waitress disappear to\" routine.  Have yet to experience that at Elwood's, as the service has been topnotch every time, and the manager always makes a point to ensure everything is running nice and smooth.  Some of my favorites so far include the pulled pork bbq with the red sauce, the almost tennis ball sized hush puppies, the baked beans, and the cornbread (cake mix in the batter is the twist here).    From an atmosphere standpoint, it has a small bar area with a few beers on draft, and also has a few tv's scattered about, but the place isn't so loud that you can't hold a conversation with the person at your table.    Definitely recommend that you give it a try, as they told me they will be tweaking the menu in a couple weeks to change up a few things, add some appetizers, etc, so looking forward to see this place evolve over the coming months.  Hopefully they will stay focused on providing a superior customer service experience, as this definitely sets them apart from their competition in my opinion."}
{"text":"Yay Yelp deal for money off! Anyway, went here with a friend for lunch before a band competition. Service was fine, although it was nothing special. We ordered corn bread and hush puppies as an appetizer. They came out fairly quickly. The corn bread was pretty good, maybe a bit dry. The hush puppies were nasty, just full of grease and heavy batter. I wouldn't get them again.   I got a huge plate of ribs for lunch with too many sides to even count (lol, just 2, but they really put a lot on the plate). The ribs were delicious, and I almost ate the whole rack. The cole slaw was good as well. My friend got a BBQ chicken sandwich and ate the whole thing. I've had BBQ from here catered, and I must say, I have not been impressed at all, dry and hard is what I've found.  Overall, I'd probably go to Shane's right down 521, but if I was meeting someone or someone wanted to go here, I wouldn't object."}
{"text":"Food is Excellent! we had the pork plate with onion rings and collard greens and they were great! We are going to make this our BBQ destination!!"}
{"text":"This is a good local BBQ joint. I try to always get the burn ends (well, maybe I should say that, cause once they are out... they are out. The ribs are very good, fall off the bone tender. The sides are also different, but in a good way (hush puppies, mac and cheese, cornbread... mmm)  They have live music in the evenings, good bands. Service is average."}
{"text":"Had a great meal with the family for a very reasonable price.  Relaxing environment, great service.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"How is this place still open? Let's start with the service (fail). After sitting down at the bar and studying the menu our server asks us \" are you ready, tell me what you want\" ; Extremely unprofessional if you ask me. We ignored the rude comment and ordered the following: beef brisket plate with hash brown casserole and green beans , dark chicken plate with fries.  Although the brisket was tender it had no flavor, the casserole   Was cold and the beans were not worth mentioning. My girlfriends dark meat plate consisted of one wing and a breast.   Come on folks, dark meat is not that hard to distinguish.  We kindly asked for the plate to be switched out for \"dark\" meat. The server took the plate and returned with dark meat but this time left out the fries.  Trying not to explode I walked up to the server and asked to replace the fries.  That clearly was a mistake   Since the fries came out undercooked. This place has nothing going for it. Crapy cold food and terrible service.   This place deserves zero stars but this app will not let me turn it off. I give it a negative five stars and will bet my 401k and Roth Ira ( both seen better days) that this place doesn't  last another 3 months."}
{"text":"My top brunch pick:  the brisket BBQ Benedict with poached eggs and grilled tomatoes nestled on English muffin halves and topped with their signature red sauce.  It made a brunch believer out of me.  I'm also a big fan of their burnt ends (juicy as pork belly) and their chunky loaded baked potato casserole."}
{"text":"I really want to rate then higher, I've been a fan since they opened. I am just frustrated with the inconsistency. The pulled pork is always decent. Yesterday the fries weren't crisp at all as they have been previous times and the hush puppies held a little too much grease. I think my biggest issue is that 2/3 of the time we have gone they have been out of the pork belly appetizer. This wouldn't be a big deal if we were ordering it as an appetizer but it is because it is one of the few items on the menu my daughter will eat. If they are out she is just eating hush puppies while the rest of us eat a full meal. Also they have not been busy any of the times they have been out. This hasn't happened once or twice but at least 4 if not 5 times. If you can't figure out how much pork belly to have ready for each day, take it off the menu."}
{"text":"Family went for lunch today and I have to say the Brisket Tacos & the Smoked Turkey BLt we go was good. Brisket had a great taste. Fries were good also. Down side was the service was slow and the mac & cheese was not very good.....not much of a taste and believe they might use sour cream and if so used to much of it."}
{"text":"I had previously reviewed Elwoods and wasn't a fan.  Management did respond to my review and I do try and give a place a second chance.  Husband went a couple of weeks ago with the guys and said it was good.  So, we went last week with the kids.  I did have a better experience and tried a different dish.  I had the pulled pork sandwich which was good and I like Elwoods sauce on it.  The hushpuppies are very good.  Service was good tonight and I have to say that I do like the drinks in the mason jars.  I did not try the sangria this time.  The cornbread tastes like cake which I am not a fan of, but we all like different things.  Hubby had the brisket which he liked, I  didn't try it this time.  We will be going back and I hope to try some different things and  get a better idea of the place."}
{"text":"Ribs were such a disappointment. Had to send them back. Dry and poor flavor. I love ribs and get them at every bbq joint I visit, not saying I'm an expert but I do know a thing or two about good ribs. Brisket was ok, not great. Server was decent but certainly nothing memorable. I probably wouldn't go back honestly"}
{"text":"Today I went in for a late brunch. We ate the fried pickles, which were awesome. Even better than the old school Penguin pickles. We also had the quiche of the day which was mozzarella and sun dried tomatoes-yum. I had mine with a side of apple sauce which is like eating apple pie filling-so delicious! They have brunch on Sat and Sun. Totally worth it! The kiddos had chicken tenders which are by far the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"It's overall a typical \"okay\" Carolinas BBQ place. The pulled pork was good, but with no special taste (the recommended sauce was great!). The sides: White slaw was a little bit boring, Mac n Cheese was good! My collegue had a burger. His opinion was also \"okay, but nothing special\". We payed about $18 which is in my opinion a fair price ;-)"}
{"text":"I was excited to eat here and boy did it let me down. I ordered ribs and they came out dry and tasted like yesterday's ribs. I ordered Mac n cheese side and it came out cold. I told the waitress and she gave it to the chef who gave me a mean look and put it in the microwave. Very disappointing"}
{"text":"After driving by this place for many months, I finally took the time to stop in and check the place out.  Now, I love some BBQ and was looking forward to the brisket with the mac n cheese with okra, but several things need to be mentioned if you choose to eat here.  For starters, they have a yelp check in offer.....but here's the catch, if you show it up the server, you may chalk up the savings to the mediocre service and food at best. It is if it is your discount for the shoddy service or less than desirable meal. I could only factor this offer as a consolation prize for the opportunity to be disappointed.  So, here's the experience.......My wife and I sat at a high top near the bar area as there were only a few tables available.  Unfortunately, we were unaware that the table was located by the door of an outdoor covered dining area used primarily for smokers.  Since it was at night, the door which was frequently used by two smokers just added to the frustration.  I understand that this is also a bar, but please, eat, smoke, drink, or whatever, but STOP taking a few puffs, and walking in and out! Geez, it was like a doorway to hell, but cold!  Cold, that's the word that summed up my whole dining experience.  The beef brisket which was suppose to come with 2 pieces of bread (toast) did not, the meat was cold as if it had just been removed from the cooler.  The sauce was ok, but again, was not hot, so cold sauce on cold meat beside a cold entrance pretty much leads me up to the following.  Cold Mac-N-Cheese.  Have you ever experienced cold mac and cheese?  Not like the cold mac n cheese at Christmas when you have a huge gathering of people and it gets room temperature after sitting out for a while, I am talking almost ice cold where the texture and temperature, is refrigerator cold. So cold in fact that the texture is almost crunchy cold.  I did not realize that cold Mac-N-Cheese was able to have that type of texture and appearance, so I did have a new experience here.  On the good note, the fried okra was very good.  It was hot, so I am sure that the staff is aware of the ability to make heat, and make items shall we say, not COLD!  So, to sum it up, if you use the yelp offer, beware!  If you like cold meat and cold sides, you will enjoy this place. If you are a smoker, well, let's just say that you will have your own covered smoking patio right near the bar area.  So would I recommend this to any fellow Yelpers...?  I don't think so.

{"text":"The decor is like a sports bar that is in a barn and is not the best place for families with children as the bar gets very loud and there is little segregation with the dining area.  The wait staff is attentive and the appetizers are great. Unfortunately the main courses and sides leave a lot to be desired for.   If you want to have a few beers with friends and have some appetizers and watch a game the. This is a good place. Just be warned that you will smell like smoke (wood) after setting foot inside so don't dress up or plan on going out afterwards unless its to a bonfire."}
{"text":"Service is always friendly, but food is fair at best. Pulled pork is stringy, dry and flavorless. Collard greens are OK.  Hush puppies are overcooked. Mac and cheese was cold. Portions are small."}
{"text":"When it comes to a large group, they can't handle it. Food is served sporadically, i.e. a wave of entrees will come for part of the group, and then the rest have to wait ten minutes while others food is getting cold. Not to mention, they were out of certain signature items, and portion sizes are so small that a grown man would need 3 pulled chicken platters to be equally full from a Big Mac. I'd suggest only ordering sides, everyone's meat was dry. Moreover, zero customers were in the restaurant besides our party of 15. You'd expect better food and better service especially on a Saturday evening. I gave an extra star for mercy as the kids meals were ok...you really cant mess up chicken tenders and mac and cheese. Maybe it was an off night, but have some respect for your establishment, especially for a large group."}
{"text":"Always on the lookout for a different place to try, we headed out to Elwood's. Way out (for us). You just keep on going. But once there, it's a cool place. Open and not your typical establishment, which is a nice change.  Service is friendly, but they didn't really seem to have things together. They offered a deal but had no idea how to redeem it when I showed them my phone. Happy to please, they did so, but were confused about it, and after that didn't want to come back by all that often.  Food was good, but nothing special or worth the extra trip, except as has already been mentioned the cornbread. That was probably worthwhile, but since it's delivered to everyone (like chips at most Mexican restaurants), do you really want to go just for that?"}
{"text":"So walking into this place for the first time I was a little worried about how slow it seemed for a Friday night.  I apparently had nothing to worry about.  The food was excellent.  I got the Brisket with homemade parmesean tater tots and the BF got the \"Burnt Ends\" with hush puppies.  OMG.  The meat was tender, the portions were big and the sides were SO flavorful.  We've been back 3 or 4 times since we ate there the first time and have kind of made it our regular hang out spot on Friday or Saturday nights.    They have live music (usually an acoustic guitar player) on Friday and Saturday who has never disapointed.  The staff are friendly and the beers on draft are very good.  They have a large selection of bottled beer and cider, as well as all kinds of liquor.    They have a very small bar section as well as a \"dining room' area that is a great place to bring kids to hear some good music (the music usually starts at 7).   They are open from 11am to 12am most days.   The only thing is, I can't seem to figure out why it's so empty everytime we go, this place is awesome!"}
{"text":"The food came out fast and the BBQ was very good.  They had live music Saturday night which was good for the kids.  The ribs were very good and lean.  The tots and hush puppy's crispy and had good flavor.  I would go back."}
{"text":"Just eaten at Elwood's BBQ.  Good beer, good music, nice service and good pulled pork.  Poor tasting sides, cold fries, overly peppered beef and tough ribs.  Will not go back for a long while."}
{"text":"I like this place.  Good BBQ, great side dishes, decent atmosphere, good service.  I have no real complaints.  Usually the side dishes are where BBQ places skimp, as they focus on the quality of the meat.  Elwoods has awesome sides:  the hush puppies are spectacular, the mac & cheese is excellent, and they have the best onion rings EVER.  The BBQ beans aren't bad, either.   This place is close to me, which is great, as the next good BBQ place from me is 15+ miles away."}
{"text":"Got a really nice email from Elwood's re: the tip issue.  I'm impressed they took the time to email and show genuine concern.  That makes me want to go back all the more.  Said they were looking into the POS system that puts the auto-tip line in.  POS in this instance likely refers to the Point of Sale (cash register); yet, given my prior gripe about tips at counter-order shops, it might also refer to something else.  Kudos for the attention to detail!"}
{"text":"No thanks. I had high hopes, but realized this was the only place on a Saturday night that didn't have a ridiculous wait - guess why? They're AWFUL. Service was fine - I see what appears to be owners walking around trying to ensure satisfaction, but good golly, the food is horrific. Cornbread has no taste - fried items are very greasy and the meat (I ordered chicken) was all fatty and very poor quality. You have to douse it in sauce to hide the otherwise bland taste. The best item we had was the fried okra - but even that required drenching in ranch dressing. I really want them to be successful. C'mon guys, get it together. Don't cut quality, ballantyne folk will PAY for quality and guess what, they'll come back time and time again. Don't focus on the live entertainment - I'd say do some quality testing and enhancements and you'll be amazed at what happens - aim for a big line/wait on a Saturday night and you'll know you're on par with the rest of Ballantynes restaurants."}
{"text":"We loved this place when we first moved to the area last summer. It used to have good BBQ, great mac & cheese, and decent service. That is all gone now. We have given them three tries now since they revamped.   The first was brunch. I ordered the chicken and waffles. They did not serve any syrup with my waffles. When I asked for some they acted confused like \"why would someone expect syrup with waffles\". It was weird. The waiter spent several minutes talking to the cooks. They all looked confused. Eventually, long after my waffle was cold, I was brought a tiny little container of ice cold syrup. I asked for butter for the waffle and never got any. Chicken strips were good though.  The second was lunch/early dinner. I ordered the burnt ends sandwich and fries. It was too fatty but otherwise tasted OK. Service was very slow and bordering on rude. It was not the worst experience but we had no intention of returning.  We drove by the other day and saw they had posted an award for best BBQ in in Charlotte. We thought that maybe something had changed and they had gotten their act together. NO. Something struck me as off when we first walked in and we almost left. We were seated and placed our orders. We both order burgers. I had the BBQ bacon burger with mac & cheese. Their new \"recipe\" for mac & cheese consists of some cooked pasta tossed with a watery (yes, watery not creamy) white sauce with flakes of peppers in it. I took one bite. Realized 1)it was disgusting and 2)that the red flakes were peppers (allergy). I told the waiter and he stared at me and asked a rude question about my pepper allergy (none of his business). I told him to take it back and bring me fries. He did, however the rest of my food was cold by the time I got the fries (not that it was very hot to start with). My burger which I ordered medium was undercooked bordering on rare. The onion ring on the burger was disgusting. It was dripping with grease. It had a good inch of batter on it that was raw, like still a liquid raw, from about halfway through into the center. And the batter tasted like old fish. Really nasty. I took it off and ate what I could of the rest of the burger. The fries were OK. Not great. My husband said his burger and fries were OK, again not great, but not as awful as mine."}
{"text":"Solid. But not delicious enough for 4 stars.  The service is great, the place is clean and comfy, and the owner is a cool dude.  The menu is innovative (burger topped with brisket?).  You've also got your standard pulled pork, chicken, ribs etc.  Good variety of sides too with big portions.  So Elwood's is def worth checking out if you're hungry and in the area.    But common, we're in Carolina and there's just better 'cue to be eaten."}
{"text":"My husband and I found this restaurant back in 2012 and were so happy to have found a great BBQ place in South Charlotte.  Their food and service was fantastic.  Key word, was.  Unfortunately at some point it seems that they have completely changed management. Their service has taken a nose dive and their menu has been changed. We have given them two tries to win back our business since we loved them so much in the beginning, but we will no longer be returning.  The first bad experience, we brought our parent's with us to try the \"awesome BBQ place\" we had found.  It took 15 minutes for our drink order to be taken and another 10 minutes for the drinks to arrive.  Our server wasn't the one who brought the drinks, so we couldn't even order for another 10 minutes. At 35 minutes into our visit, we ordered.  I still can't get over a BBQ restaurant changing their menu to no longer offer sweet potato fries. My mother in law decided that the brownie/ice cream desert sounded good, so she ordered it.  HUGE mistake.  Not sure if the \"brownie\" was store bought or had been stored in the freezer but it was cardboard like and disgusting.  On the bright side, we all saved using up those calories.  The second experience was two months later and we were hopeful that things had improved.  The service again was slow and terrible.  Given that we were one of three occupied tables and there were at least 5 people working, I just do not understand why it should take so long.   After finally getting our order taken (25 minutes after arriving) we were informed that they were OUT of 1. Pork BBQ 2. Chicken BBQ and 3. Fries.   ARE YOU KIDDING ME?   Why in the world didn't you tell us when we sat down that you were out of the main foods that we came in to eat. The server made no apologies for not telling us sooner and acted annoyed that we asked her to stay at our table while we made new decisions (couldn't risk her disappearing for another 15 minutes).  Thankfully Midwood has opened a location about 2 miles down the road in Ballantyne."}
{"text":"Service is Ok! Food was terrible!  I went into Elwoods because I drive past the place everyday and I love to support local restaurants.  I should have kept on driving.  I arrived, the place was empty and sat at the bar, I asked the bartender if they can prepare there burgers med., to which she said yes.  I was super excited because not every restaurant allows you to pick the temps of the burger.  Yum, I thought a nice juicy burger! I got a beer while I waited and took my $12 cheeseburger (YES just a patty and cheese)  home, only to find out the burger was not medium, nor medium well, the burger was beyond well done and DRY! Also, when I called to complain they told me to come back 3 days later and speak with the owner! WHAT?? You mean someone in the next 3 days wouldn't be able to politely say I'm sorry, let me get you a new burger. WTF!?!?!? It was such a disappointment and spending $12 on horrible burger, when I could have went to Five guys instead made me more angry..."}
{"text":"We ordered it to grand the food was warm and ready to go when we got there.  The size of the food was good and the hush puppies were great.  I would go back!"}
{"text":"Old owner sold business, didn't know service lousy!!! Food was below average not what it use to be, stay away"}
{"text":"Ordered food to-go tonight from Elwoods and we thought it was really good!   We called it in and the lady that answered the phone and took our order was very pleasant.    When I arrived the hostess guided me to the bar to pick up the order.  The bartender was super nice and greeted me promptly with our food and my bill.    I ordered just a regular burger, with American cheese, lettuce, tomato, grilled onions and bacon.   I asked for it to be medium rare because whenever I say medium at other restaurants it's always over cooked.  Well it was perfectly medium rare!  So juicy and so good!  The bun was a perfect accompaniment because it wasn't too bulky but didn't fall apart either!  I chose onion rings for side and they were good too!  Should have asked for a side of ranch but that was my bad.  My husband ordered the local burger that has pimento cheese and bacon on it and he loved it!    So when I used the ever helpful yelp app, they offer an order of fried pickles when you check in.  I asked as I ordered if I could have those since I'm not dining in and they obliged no problems.  My husband and I did not like them.  They were way too salty for our liking.  That was the only issue we had with our entire order.  All in all we definitely will be dining at (or out) Elwoods in the future!  I'm excited to try their brisket!!!"}
{"text":"AWESOME service! Local craft beers! The homemade buns were incredible. Great cozy atmosphere. I had the pulled pork sandwich; it was very tender and most but lacked seasoning / flavor (the reason for only 3 stars). The sauces were all decent.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My family and I tried this restaurant on Memorial Day for lunch.  We were expecting a typical good BBQ place. Nothing spectacular but a good solid BBQ place. We were pleasantly surprised. The BBQ is very good and they meet all of the Carolina BBQ fanatics. They have mustard based, vinegar, and tomato vinegar sauces and all are excellent with the pork. I had the hot Parmesan wings and they were excellent. And what is great is that they have gluten free options for those like me that are intolerant of gluten.  The service was very attentive and friendly. They also have many activities that make it a great hangout place. I will be back and will be spreading the word to others to come here."}
{"text":"First time here on recommendation of a friend. Very good beer and drink special prices. Bloody Mary's are large AND tasty!  AJ, my bartender was attentive without being overbearing. The GM, Dan came over to say hello to me as well. You can sense the place is focusing on customer service.   Had the wings on AJ's recommendation. They were smoky in flavor and the neat was moist. I like mine spicy and was told they are bringing in a Six Alarm flavor shortly.   About to try the fried pickles. As a Northern guy, I'm not sure my review of those mean anything.  Atmosphere is very relaxed. Good place for groups and kids. Looking forward to trying their BBQ sandwiches and plates in future visits!"}
{"text":"We have been long time patrons of Elwood's. We found out when we dined last night they had new owners. We noticed BIG improvements! The food was great!! Loved the new menu items...totchos...yum! Great prices, great atmosphere, great service! They smoke their meats daily, so you know it is always fresh and not reheated.   We are tough critics and Elwood's is our go to place to always be satisfied!!"}
{"text":"Slower service when I was there (during playoffs) but the food was excellent, though slightly pricey."}
