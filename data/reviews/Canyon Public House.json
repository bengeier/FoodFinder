{"text":"I've been to the previous restaurants in this location and I've always liked the location.  It's close to our house and the restaurant is clean, well decorated and maintained.  Unfortunately I won't be going back.  We decided to go there last night for their Thursday \"wing night\".   Unlike most places on wing night, the bar was nearly empty.     We ordered drinks and four orders of wings.   The service was pretty slow, but not terrible.   The wings took a LONG time to come.  When they finally arrived we commented to the waitress and she seemed offended, and went on to make excuses how we came \"during a rush\" and did not make any sort of apology.    Unfortunately two of the four orders of wings must have been sitting out for quite some time because they were barely above room temperature by the time we got them. Furthermore, none of our \"pounds\" of wings even had 10 wings on the plate.   I didn't have a scale handy, but I think it's questionable whether they were actually a pound.   This is all in addition to their wing deal being $7/lb which is nearly double  the price of some other wing nights in the neighbourhood.  As I was driving and the rest of our party was having some drinks, I ordered a pop to go with my wings.    The quality of the fountain pop was also abysmal.  Normally we like to go to wing night, order a few rounds of wings and drinks but in this case we were so disappointed we left after a single round.  I want to support this neighbourhood restaurant but I just can't recommend it based on this experience."}
{"text":"This location is a hard one for business to stay at which is too bad because it's a great location and great on the inside.  It started as Halo then became the Smith and is now called Canyon Public House. If anyone remembers the Smith it was delicious but then one night closed and never reopened. It left employees and bands unpaid and they had just done a huge renovation from Halo. They even left the place a mess.  Because it was just updated when Canyon started it didn't have to do any renovations. Therefore it still looks nice and clean on the inside but they did add a big screen near the bar so that you can't see into the kitchen anymore.  It wasn't so busy on the night we went but the reason it got a 3 is because it lost 1 star for not having friendly service as our waitress was really rude, they were out of the cookie dough cheesecake donuts so I was disappointed and they wouldn't attempt to make or create a cucumber martini when asked. However, they did gain one star because it was my aunties birthday so they gave her a free apple pie.  It also seems they kept the menu the same from the Smith or hardly changed it so I may have to go back and give them another chance."}
{"text":"Next! How many restaurants will have to take over this location before somebody gets it right? We tried the new take over of this building,  so hoping we would have a great place to go close to home, only to be disappointed yet again. It wouldn't even have to be great, just a decent reliable place to go.  My husband ordered the burger and said it was actually one of the worst burgers he has ever had, including fast food places.  I had the fish and chips and struggled to find any fish amongst  the dried out batter that was honestly to difficult to cut with a steak knife. The third person in our party order the oriental salad which she commented \" hard to wreck a salad\".  To end the night my husband went to the washroom in the basement to discover what seemed to be a bit coin mining operation from behind closed doors.   No restaurant that is interested in providing good food uses a room full of racks and rack or computers.   Say no more!"}
