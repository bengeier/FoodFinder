{"text":"Need to buy goat meat?

I am keep buying from this place for  a year as they have nice goat meat. But the customer service sucks, they refused to choose you buy what you want. You need to take what they offer. Don't even go near to that place on friday, they refuse to serve you as they are busy with the restaurant. 

The manner they deal with the customers and blank out response they give sucks. It looks like he is doing a favor to me by selling meat at his store."}
{"text":"I come here to get my henna and fix of baklava. It's always super friendly, the cashiers are quick and effecient and did I mention the baklava? I always make sure to buy a pound or two before going on a roadtrip!"}
{"text":"I went here to buy a couple things and ended up getting some baklava as well. The sign said $8.99 per pound or $1.99 per piece. The man who runs the place told me there is about 6 pieces per pound so I decided to go with that. He said that it's cheaper going with the pound rather than buying piece by piece. After picking out my 6 pieces I did some more shopping. When I came back to pay he told me the baklava costs $13 and some change. I asked him how it came out to that price and he said it ended up being a pound & a half. I never saw him weigh it. The price he charged me was even more than the individual price. He's not the nicest guy to deal with and he's the only person I've ever seen running the store. The baklava isn't that great to want to come back for it. There are many shops in the same area to go to that won't rip you off. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Eat and shop here frequently. Always treated well and always get good deals on hard to find ingredients. The market is tiny, but mighty! Buy some pistachio baklava. It will make your day."}
{"text":"Came here to get quarters for the parking meter, but felt guilty asking for change so we decided to purchase something. The man behind the counter was SO nice, and when I started asking questions about what everything was, he very patiently explained it all to me. Zam Zam water is holy water, didja know that? You can buy it here if you want! 

They also have quite possibly the BEST baklava I have ever had: hazelnut, drizzled in chocolate, perfectly made. LOVED it. I am going to see if they can ship it to me, I have never had baklava that delicious and now that I have I don't think I can live without it. 

YUMMMMM!"}
{"text":"Great prices!  Great food!

I buy certain things here that are hard to find elsewhere.  Here is my typical grocery list:

1 lb. hommos - $4.99
1 lb. kalamata olives - $4.99
1 lb. feta cheese - $3.99
1 bag greek style pita bread (fluffy) - $3.29
1 lb. dates - 4.99
1 pkg dried figs - $5.99
bulk spices - $2 - $4 per 4 oz bag (4 oz is a lot of spice!)


While I'm there I will usually get a dessert to go or a slice of pizza.  Their Gyro sandwich is great too!

Love this place!"}
{"text":"I recently went to this Market and Deli.  The business, though small, has many things.  The hommus from here is quite good.  I would recommend this place.  It is not totally Middle Eastern.  It also has some Northern Indian foodstuffs there.  This is a good place.  It is simple, yet good.  I wish the business luck."}
