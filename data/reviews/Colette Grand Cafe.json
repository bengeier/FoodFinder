{"text":"Great atmosphere. Seafood is great and fresh. Love big glass window.a perfect place for first time dates"}
{"text":"Beautiful place and the service was very lovely. My friend and I came here for dinner in July on a Tuesday night. It wasn't very busy when we arrived. It's a bit more expensive, but based on the food and service, I would definitely recommend it for anniversaries or special date nights :)

My favourite was the Souffle au Chevre, it was very beautiful and delicious!"}
{"text":"Super good dinner, food was wonderful and staff very accommodating, it's a Toronto must do!"}
{"text":"I use to frequent Colette when it first opened; loved it just as I love The Chase. We had a horrible experience one night, so we left after appetizers and decided to go to Patria, where they treated us incredibly (as always.)  I haven't been back since and truthfully; with the amount of amazing restaurants in Toronto that understand how important great food and impeccable service is... why would I choose to go back to Colette? My reasoning for the 2 star rating is because the Parisan interior of the restaurant is absolutely stunning, and the sommelier is very knowledgeable. Also, the food is decent but very overpriced for what it is.  If you need a last minute last resort dinner option this will do the trick, just don't expect anything incredible. But with all the new places in Toronto opening up and all the great places I already frequent, I most likely won't go back"}
{"text":"Beautifully designed restaurant with intricate attention to detail from the cutesy monogrammed plates to the delectable food served on them. I went to Colette just after its opening for a birthday lunch for my partner, which was according to him, the highlight of his birthday! 

The food was stellar, I had the souffle whilst my partner had the halibut. Both of which were a delight to the palette, very light and airy which we found fitting for a weekday lunch along with the Parisien ambiance of the dining room. Dessert, delicious riz au lait with a happy birthday biscuit. 

Yum!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to come and try Colette. Came here with a group of girls for Saturday brunch. Arrived at 12:45 and was told we would be seated between half hour to one hour. At 1:15 there were two empty tables and we asked if one of them was ours. We were told those were for 2:00 reservations. Keeping a reservation on time is completely understandable but holding two tables for 45 minutes is a little bit excessive. We expressed our frustrations and were told that a table was finishing and it would be ours, the manager did offer us mimosas and so we decided to continue waiting. About 10 minutes later we were informed that another person joined the table we were waiting for and that they were now unsure if we would be able to be seated. Unfortunately we continued to wait, at 2:15 the second reservation had not come yet and we were extremely frustrated. We were told by the manager that the party they were waiting on was a meeting to discuss their wedding and that basically we were not important customers because our money was not as much as they would potentially be spending in the future (this is what was the most disappointing for me, not the waiting but being told someone else is a more important customer). I have never in my life (and have been to restaurants all over Toronto) that I was not an important customer and that after waiting an hour and a half there would be no table for me. Didn't even get to eat here. Very unimpressed with the service."}
{"text":"Meh. Colette had been on my list for a while so I was excited to celebrate my birthday here. The decor is beautiful, the service was amazing and the cocktails were fantastic. I ordered the country breakfast and was SUPER disappointed. The eggs were plain (no seasoning or fancy twist at all) and not very warm, nothing special about the potatoes and the one slice of toast was plain - no butter or jam. 
The desserts made up for the blah food. They did bring me a dessert on the house for my birthday which was a little bit of chocolate heaven. 
I'd like to try the Sunday brunch buffet but at a set $50, who knows what the food would be like. 
I'll probably go back but would only be for cocktails and dessert. Too bad."}
{"text":"I have come here on many many occasions. It's been my favourite go-to French fusion restaurant in Toronto for some time. I have sat inside, outside, dined during brunch, dinner, etc. Food quality and decor are absolutely (1 of few) the best in Toronto. However, I noticed it's gone slightly downhill since it first opened in terms of menu quality, washroom cleanliness and customer service. (To be specific, I noticed servers have developed slight \"attitudes\" towards certain, other clientele after more and more wealthy people have discovered this place and come here). However, in my opinion it still deserves 4 stars for the time being."}
{"text":"Je m attendais à mieux ...  éviter de choisir le Canard , viande nerveuse ...
Mais le cadre est vraiment sympa ."}
{"text":"We had the Tour de Colette with Frites for the table. Everything was incredible. We also added an assortment of B.C and New Brunswick oysters that were so fresh. The service, wine, food and atmosphere were amazing. I want to go back for more!"}
{"text":"Pretty to take a photo. The staff are mostly ok. We were put off by the hostess who seemed to think that some people deserved to be spoken with before others.  Also apparently, seating for Sunday brunch stops at 11am? This was very confusing to us.  The coffee take out part is better.  I'd rather spend my brunch money somewhere else."}
{"text":"Went for the Sunday brunch buffet. We had a reservation and it's highly recommended that you make one. The variety would appeal to anyone and they had a nice amount of fresh seafood to choose from. Lots of salads and hot items such as eggs benedict with a really amazing hollandaise sauce. I wish we caught our servers name because she was excellent which always adds to the experience.
I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"1. Ambiance is great. That's all to it!
2. The Place was packed and seems like people were anticipating for a great dining experience. 
3. Our server tried her best to provide good service but you can definitely feel how insincere she was. 
4. We  chose the winterlicious menu and we were greatly disappointed. It did not meet our expectation. Food was underwhelming and lacked taste. We've had better meal.
5. I had Cured Lake Trout Salad,Braised Pork Cheek Sandwich,Tropical fruit Sundae
6. Had to ask for salt and also noticed other tables asked for salt. 
7. Didn't get our money's worth. Will  not come back for sure."}
{"text":"First visit, and did not disappoint. Ticks off all the boxes of a good cafe. Notoriously busy on weekends, I came on a weekday morning and enjoyed a quiet hour by the window in the bakery cafe.

Service is very friendly and attentive. The Batista even offered to bring the hot water to my table when he was clearly busy making espresso.

Food was delicious. I ordered a lemon scone, two cappuccinos, and a nutella croissant. The scone was delicate and fluffy with lovely lemon flavor. The nutella croissant was perfectly laminated with the perfect amount of salt in the dough. The cappuccinos were aromatic and rich, however, would have been better had they been hotter.

Awesome music and lighting. 

Look forward to returning."}
{"text":"Had brunch here on a visit to Toronto from New York & it certainly was the highlight of my trip"}
{"text":"Sunday brunch for 2 at their all-you-can-eat brunch buffet. Great variety! Although this brunch costed as much as a good dinner for 2 ($55 per person before tax and tip), I'd recommend it for a special occasion or a treat as it is worth trying. You could order omelettes and crepes with the forms at your table and freshly squeezed juices, coffee and tea are included with the price! Make sure you make reservations online as I noticed they turned down many walk-ins."}
{"text":"Colette grand cafe Salad Bar
If you love Sunday brunch at this chic frenchie retreat, you'll love the edited but chic salad bar offered weekdays only from 11:30-2pm. The presentation is not just lovely but tasty and variety is top! Everything from seared steak toppings to burrata panini bites, and wait till you discover the decadent dessert options.

{"text":"Absolutely one of the best restaurants in the city which actually has some class. I have eaten around the world and staff were very courteous and welcoming. I had the salad bar for brunch with a friend and we loved it all. Great job on everything - and the macarons are PERFECT!!!!"}
{"text":"Went for Sunday brunch. $54 a head gets you unlimited fresh juices (the grapefruit was sublime!), tea, and coffee, as well as made to order omelette/crepes and of course the buffet. 

The highlight for me were their crab claws and shrimp cocktail which were juicy and deliciously fresh. They keep it pretty well stocked too. Also really enjoyed their French onion soup bar, where you can top with as much or little bread and cheese as you like. The rest was pretty standard French-inspired brunch fair (croque madames, quiche, pastries, salads, bacon, etc. 

Only real disappointment was their lack of brunch cocktails. No Belinis or caesars. But mimosa was good since they use their freshly squeezed oj. 

Ambiance is great. Decor and service is on point. Perfect for birthday brunch parties, meeting the in laws, dates, and hanging out with the girls. Diners were dressed to impress for a Sunday afternoon. Comparable to the Soho House Sunday feast brunch. 

Would be a mistake to not make reservations for the brunch."}
{"text":"The space is beautiful, they really did a great job with the décor. As per the service and the food, it's been a hit or miss over the 4 times I have been here. The food is definitely over-priced. While the tour de colette is beautiful and great to share over a beverage, $65 for a few pickled mussels, one crab knuckle, and a tiny bit of lobster salad with raw/cooked vegetables is not very justifiable. On the other hand, the foie gras was great and the ahi tuna was good. Steak was a steak. I really think this is a better spot for coffee or just drinks, rather than dinner."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday Brunch ($54 per person)..They have seatings and I had the 1230 one for party of two..when I got there around 1215, there was a big crowd of people waiting since I guess the earlier seating wasn't finished yet...got seated around 1250.

the tables (especially for parties of 2) are TIGHT..as in you will need to push the table around to move out to the food area even if you're fashion model skinny... Service was overall good but inconsistent..they seem to not refill my juice/coffee unless I asked but they will take my plates and refold my napkin and even give fresh cutlery each time I go get more food.

The selection was small especially for hot foods..and the \"hot\" foods was cool at most..choices included overcooked scrambled eggs, saussage, bacon, pancakes (hard and not fluffy), french toast, waffles and fried chicken, roast beef (cold and tough) and salmon wellington (taste okay but cool)..that's it!

the cold table had some salads and peeled shrimp and crab claws...there's a lobster salad that was pretty good but they never refilled it after my first serving and they replaced it with artifical crab meat salad..Are they really so cheap to not refill the lobster salad even for people who make it here by 1230pm and paying $54 a head? ...Dessert was very disappointing (mandarin had more selection and better quality) ..they had some macarons but i didn't get to eat it since ..yup...didn't refill it and none left when I went at around 130

overall the decor was nice, but seating was tight, service inconsistent, food selection poor, quality mediocore and they don't seem to refill anything from drinks to to the more \"desirable\" food items.

When I left, I went to bakery side to buy a macaron (dark chocolate) and get an americano since couldn't get macaron from brunch and I didn't want to hound them down for another coffee... and the macaron was okay..not bad, but nothing special either...$3 for a pretty big one.  but americano was bad..flavorless ... 

skip this place is my recommendation or if you must..go for regular meal service and not sunday brunch"}
{"text":"Just had brunch here this morning because of the rave reviews someone gave us from the salon down the street.  Colette did not disappoint.  The patio was very pleasant.  This place is decorated like a cafe in Paris without being pretentious.  Staff were very nice.  Food was excellent."}
{"text":"Had dinner with friends at 7pm on Friday night. The ambience was very nice. Service was good but not great. They were slow to prepare the food. Restaurant was not busy at this time but it became packed as the evening progressed. For my appetizer I ordered a crab cake. Which was cooked perfectly and tasted great. My boyfriend ordered wild mushroom soup which looked more like gravy and did not taste great. For my entree I ordered lamb. It was expensive because I only got ONE tiny lamb chop for $30. Moroccan style lamb chop tasted sweet. My boyfriend's flat iron steak was slightly bigger but it tasted great. We ordered dessert. We ordered a St. Honore cake and creme brulee. Don't order the creme brulee. It was all soft and chewy. 75% of it was left uneaten. Cause the creme brulee was terrible they credited our table for all the dessert we ordered. I only gave three out of 5 star cause portion for my entree was too small for the price paid and the creme brulee was terrible. I won't go out of my way to try this restaurant again but if I was conveniently in the area I might give them a second chance."}
{"text":"Came here for the weekend brunch and that's what I'm basing my review on.

Service, it was really good. Brunch is a buffet style where you go up and take what you like which means you leave your plates when you finish.  Not once did I return back to my seat and saw my old plate there. Not only that, they also swap out your cutlery each time.

Food, I thought it was good, but not worth the cost. They have a omelette station where you custom order omelettes and they take it to your table once they are made (you can order egg white only), small variety of meats (one type of bacon, one type of sausage), there was a hot meat counter which had salmon wellington, ham and lamb, the cheese and meat section was pretty large (I recall 3 types of cheese and the same amount of meat), the seafood section was okay, had again roughly 3 items (smoked salmon, alaskan crab legs, and calmari). The dessert section is quite large and easily my favourite part of the meal. Check out some pictures that others have posted for an idea of the variety and size.

Atmosphere, the place is very well decorated although not really that large of a space. It has space for I would imagine about 100 people, but even then, when we left at around noon, there was a line out the door.

Cost, $54 + tax per person. I think it is a bit much for what you get.

Tips, make sure to get reservations because it gets quite busy. If you drive on Sunday, there is plenty of free street parking until 1pm nearby."}
{"text":"You leave this restaurant feeling completely ripped off. I should have trusted my instincts about this place when I called to make reservation for brunch - and the first thing I was told was that I had to be out within two hours. I haven't even stepped in yet and you're already telling me when I have to leave? Anyways we gave it a try, and it was a huge disappointment. The buffet spread is average at best, with made to order omelettes that were mediocre. The waiters hover over you like vultures - less to help, more to remove your plate the second you taste your last bite. The message is clear - come on, come on, hurry up. The final touch? 55 dollars per person - that's right, fifty five dollars per person for a standard buffet spread. You can get much better value at one of the fancy hotels downtown. Stay away."}
{"text":"Sunday Buffet Brunch Review: $54+tax. The price is definitely high but well worth it for a special occasion. The gorgeous french atmosphere and beautiful food is an experience in itself. The hot food includes: scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, fried chicken and waffles, pancakes, french toast, carving station, salmon wellington, made-to-order omelettes and eggs benedict-which are both brought to your table, so no waiting around. There is also a cold food section with various salads like beet and goat cheese, sweet pea, quinoa, roasted vegetables, quiche and fresh seafood including crab claws, shrimp and calamari.   Save room for dessert! French macarons, creme brûlée, lemon meringue pie, tiramisu, mini cinnamon donuts, mini caramel apples, cake pops...just to name a few! The desserts are truly small works of art. The service is excellent ; servers are attentive and clear every plate and cutlery after each round. Overall, if you appreciate good food, presentation and atmosphere, you will adore Colette!"}
{"text":"Very friendly and prompt service by the wait staff.  The buffet was fresh with many items you could tell were homemade.  The shrimp were big and tasty and the homemade seafood sauce was a great match.  While the roast lamb wasn't anything spectacular, this high end place did a great crispy fried chicken to pair with waffles.  The salmon wellington was also tasty."}
{"text":"My family thoroughly enjoyed our visit to this lovely restaurant. Located within walking distance of many downtown attractions, I would recommend calling ahead as it is quite popular. The service was wonderful. 

We had the salad bar which was perfect to satisfy without going overboard and had a nice selection to choose from, some things that you thought were familiar were made so much better by the quality ingredients (That's right bite-sized chocolate mousse, I am talking about you) All in all, that's what stood out.... familiar foods done so well, they became luxuries. Thank you for a great visit!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service!  Recommend their croissants, macaroons and Sunday brunch"}
{"text":"Came here with my girlfriend for the sunday brunch. The food was spectacular! It's an all-you-can-eat style buffet, yet one with the freshest food. As they are pretty busy, food gets demolished and replenished timely. 

They did a roast (beef?) and salmon wellington, it was delicious, and the amazing staff was able to cut me a small sliver as requested so I can sample more of their food (which i really appreciate)! 

They offer a crab leg seafood salad, probably one of my favourite items they offer."}
{"text":"My favourite thing about Colette is the super amazing decor!  That being said, I think the food was just okay, maybe a bit less when you consider the price.  I have no issues spending a lot on meals, especially on special occasions (like Valentine's Day) but when I do go to expensive restaurants, my expectations are a bit higher and I want to be WOW'ed by my meal.
For apps, we ordered the crab legs for two which had a nice lemon butter sauce and frites. We also got the lobster bisque.  Is lobster bisque supposed to be served lukewarm/room temperature? I'm not entirely sure but that's how this soup came out and I have to say I'd have preferred if it were hot.
The frites and crab legs were the best part of our meal.
For entrees, we got the halibut and a mushroom pasta dish.  Both were under-whelming.  Everything was a bit on the bland side, except for the frites. Not too much of an issue for me since I don't like over-salty foods. 
We skipped dessert as all I wanted was a croissant and they were out of the butter ones. 

I wouldn't recommend this restaurant for dinner, but I am intrigued by the weekend brunch buffet and will likely come back to try that.

(Note: I went to grab a croissant from the bakery one morning to satisfy my craving and it was HEAVENLY! Probably the best butter croissant I've had in Toronto.)"}
{"text":"Excellent service. Delicious food. Nice classy atmosphere here. The 2nd time had a live jazz playing. Their specials were really good. We had to wait a long time for my 2nd time there, with reservations.  They comp'd us wine, which was nice. If I was hungry, it probably would have been a problem. But I was just left with half the girls sleepy by the end of the meals."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite places to eat. The atmosphere is lovely, the staff are wonderful, the food is good, and the prices are quite reasonable. Brunch on a Saturday came out to be less than $25 (if you order a coffee and not a cocktail, after tax and tip). And the decor? Just absolutely beautiful. It's a fantastic place to celebrate an event or catch up with a friend."}
{"text":"BRUNCH! If you're looking for a fun, high end brunch or brunch buffet, this is the place. Gorgeous decor, fun menu items. It is pricey but worth it for a splurge. Try the fried chicken. Great service!"}
{"text":"I love going here for brunch.  The service is top notch, the decor is beautiful and the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Came here for my anniversary and everything about this place is SO ON POINT. The decor, the delicious food and drinks, the impeccable service. We were treated so well and the food is SO good. I got the wild mushroom soup to start and the halibut as my main, and both were amazing!  I highly recommend to come here for a special occasion, they truly do a great job at making it feel special. They even gave us a \"Happy Anniversary\" card and didn't charge us for our dessert. Can't wait to come back here again!"}
{"text":"I`ve been here a number of times.

Come for the decor. Food is OK. Wait staff is generally competent, but the hostesses always suck. As always, given its location, you get the King West crowd out in force (which could be a good or bad thing depending on your preference). Would easily be close to a four star if the hostesses were changed up."}
{"text":"I've been intending to go to this place for a long time. The decor and ambiance don't disappoint. Very beautiful and Parisian. However, the same problem that grapes most Toronto restaurants is present here as well: noise, noise and noise. The level of noise is simply far too high here. We had their buffet lunch and I have to say it was delicious but not too fancy. I would have expected a bit more flair specially with their desserts but overall, I would visit them again to see how their brunch is."}
{"text":"Best brunch I have ever seen! We always go as a treat at least every few months, would definitely recommend to anyone who loves good food.
The atmosphere is so nice, high ceiling, baby blue sofas and bright light from the floor to ceiling windows."}
{"text":"I think the $54 buffet was way over priced. The food selection wasn't that good as they only serve frozen shrimp, mini crab claws, mini desserts and typical breakfast (i.e. scrambled egg, pancakes etc). The scrambled egg, pancakes were really below average. The deserts and the omlette were decent though but $54 it's really not worth it. Furthermore, they never list out the buffet price anywhere on their website, outside of their door, etc.

I give this place two stars for its very nice decorative environment and friendly staff."}
{"text":"A friend of mine from Toronto couldn't stop talking about this restaurant.. so I had to try it out for myself. I went in for Sunday Brunch. 

This place makes you feel like you're in Paris. It's an exquisite restaurant. The food is not only delicious, but also beautiful. 

Everything is perfectly displayed. Their brunch was buffet style. They had everything from sea food, to cheeses and pancakes. 
The staff was very attentive and nice. 

I highly recommend this place.. can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I love Colette's baked goods - the croissants are buttery, rich, and crisp. The pain au chocolat and almond croissant are also particularly lovely. 

Both times I've been here I've ordered from the bakery. The smoked salmon croissant sandwich ($9) is delicious. It includes hard boiled eggs, arugula, and a fresh mayonnaise. 

The interior of the bakery is stunning and it's lovely sitting out on the patio. Staff are very friendly and chatty. The drinks can sometimes take a while to come out, but staff will arrange to bring them to your table if there will be a bit of a wait."}
{"text":"Food: 8/10
Atmosphere: 10/10 
Service: N/A - explained in review
Overall experience: 9/10

My friend took me to Colette for a birthday \"brunch\". It is a fantastic place to go when you are celebrating an occasion. The entire place is beautiful and feels worthy enough to deem unique for your celebration. 

The reason there is no service rating is because there was no wait staff when we were there. We ordered pastries and coffee from the bakery, and it was brought to us, but that was the extent of the service. That being said, those who did take our orders were pleasant and helpful. 

What we ate was good. Nothing really stands out, and I can not speak for their lunch/dinner food. However, Colette gets a high rating due to their design. Sitting in a grand, Parisian-inspired room really does influence your experience, even if the food was just normal. 

The bottom line: though the food is normal, you may come just for the decor (and the instagrams), and that's okay."}
{"text":"Came with a friend for a regular monthly brunch. I suggested we try Colette - I did not realize that SUNDAY brunch is actually $54.  Why did I not know that?  Sticker shock for sure at the end with the $150+ bill (courtesy of a few Caesars - alcohol not included in the AYCE).

That said, my friend and I weren't as dressed up as some people we saw (basically in formals, with heels). He was wearing some trendy ass linen shirt with a hole in it. I can't remember what I was wearing. I think skinny jeans and flats.  We felt under dressed but were treated well regardless.  In fact, they were extremely accommodating when we moved to the patio midway through the meal to enjoy the sunshine and a few more drinks and dessert.

This is a great place for an 'occasion' or anyone spending a stronger currency. Also if you want to put on earrings and heels (guys, I'm talking to you). I've earmarked it for future events."}
{"text":"My visit was for a business lunch with my boss & co-workers. 
This is a chic experience from the moment you walk in, the food and the staff. 

I had the 'buffet style' lunch where you could try a wide variety of delectable miniature sandwiches, salads and desserts. 

Portion sizes were perfect, as you didn't feel super heavy after finishing the meal. And for those who want something a little different, there is access to a regular menu in which you can order from. 

Great selfie and photo ops for sure, the cafe has a very French chic vibe. I hope to come back again in the Spring!"}
{"text":"I celebrated my birthday at this restaurant and had the most wonderful experience.  From the kind and attentive service to the delicious food and decadent desserts -- I would certainly have an event here again!"}
{"text":"I had an amazing ladies lunch, we had the $25 salad bar buffet, which has plenty more than just salad, they had a velvety and delicious cream of mushrooms, a salad with steak in it, prawns, several kinds of salads, a fish dish and lots of dessert.  Their wine list is great and the drinks are delicious, the service was excellent and the decor exquisite."}
{"text":"Visited with my wife last night Colette Restaurant. 

First of all the place atmosphere is amazing! The decor and the live music made us feel like we are away from Toronto in some high end Miami Restaurant. 

The food was delicious, my wife got a charlotte salad for starters and halibut for main dish and I got wild mushroom soup for starters and lamb for main. All I got to say we felt like licking the plates it was that good. 

We finished the night with macaroons.

Over experience was 5 stars. Definitely recommended for dates nights and going out with friends. 

Please note the place is pricey but you definitely get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"I had an excellent meal at Colette.  While I was not keen to have a cold appetizer, the starter shrimp dish was savoury and fresh. The presentation and the taste were outstanding.  My main meal, the trout was also amazing. The outside skin was hot and crisp and the flesh was tender and very tasty. The cod dish was also quite flavorful. I would definately repeat my meal."}
{"text":"If you are looking for an upscale French decor pretentious atmosphere then you've come to the right place. I came here two weeks ago with my cousin, and well, we did not have a good time, especially since I had very high expectations. I never felt so out of place before in my life, and I've been to a few upscale high end restaurants. Apparently, you have to dress up a lot or else you get weird looks from the waiters and staff. 

The interior: The decor is very elegant, classy, and French themed. They have an amazing seating area, lounge/bar area, and the interior are designed very well. There are lots of random paintings, portraits, and photos on the wall, which is nice to look at. The colour theme and music are very pleasant. Overall, it's definitely a beautiful place, and very picture worthy. 

The food: We ordered from the dinner menu, and we were only here for appetizers and dessert. We ordered the veal tartare, goat cheese souffle, mozzarella, macaroons, profiteroles, and smores croissant. The veal tartare was okay, although I felt like the dijon was a bit over powering. The goat cheese souffle was horrible, super bitter, and we had to return it. Mozzarella pretty good, nothing extraordinary. The macaroons were horrible! For a French inspired restaurant, they do need to work on their macaroons, it was very dry and flaky, and you couldn't taste the different flavours. I will say the best dessert I ever had was the Profiteroles with vanilla ice cream with caramel cream and warm chocolate sauce, it was extremely good (even though it's off menu, you have to ask for it now). The smores croissant was delicious as well, and basically was everything you wanted out of a smores croissant. The presentation of each of the food dishes were pretty, and the portion sizes were small, however keep in mind this is a French inspired place. 

The service: It was the most dissatisfying of my entire experience. Our server had a friendly condescending manner, and I'm not sure if that was on purpose to go along with the French atmosphere (joke) or that was his personality. When we ordered the goat cheese souffle, and told the server how unsatisfied we were, he immediately changed it for another app, and it was not counted towards for final bill, and yes that was very generous of him, however it came with a snobby remark, \"Well girls, at least you have a picture of instagram so it can look like you actually ordered two dishes,\" that was very insulting and embarrassing nonetheless. Yes, Colette is a beautiful place and so what if we enjoy taking pictures of our food, and the restaurant. I had to actually explain, that I review restaurants on yelp a lot, and I like to share my photos on yelp/instagram. We live in the digital age, where we want to share all our experiences with the world. We did not ask for it to be taken off our bill, and we have sufficient money to pay for our food. It felt as if, the waiter kept questioning our ability to pay for our food, which was ridiculous. At one point, the server asked us what we do for a living, which I don't think is appropriate for a restaurant setting. It was a very humiliating experience, nonetheless I left a very generous tip for the server, not that I had anything to prove but because I have the ability to do so. 

Overall: Basically, don't come here undressed because the staff and other customers will look down at you. The food is alright, nothing special, and I don't know what the hype was all about anymore. I wouldn't recommend this place if you don't want to be judged based on your appearance, and have people question your capability to purchase dinner or humiliate you. One of the worst experiences of my life, and I would never come back here ever again."}
{"text":"I had a terrible time at this restaurant. I walked in and there was no one at the host station. It took 10 minutes before someone could help us. After flagging someone, the hostess finally came over to sit us. She was rude and made us hang our own coats. When we sat down it took them ten minutes to get someone to come over and attend to us. Mind you the restaurant wasn't even busy. The manager was texting on his phone at the bar. No one ask us about tea or coffee. Or even if we enjoy our meal. The only good thing about this place was the food. Worst restaurant in front of toula at the Westin."}
{"text":"I must admit this place is beautiful and the food is fantastic. The inside looks very elegant and the service was amazing. Our waited was very polite. The place gets busy so it is a little bit on the loud side but we don't mind that.
Loved it"}
{"text":"Yay and Nay for Colette's Brunch

Came here for Sunday Brunch with high expectations since I've been trying to get a reservation here for a few weeks and found out the only way to do this is to book at least 2 weeks in advance.

Colette is a medium sized restaurant with dainty french cottage decor and beautiful natural light.  At brunch the bar is transformed into a buffet of all things seafood, sandwhiches, charcuterie, hot breakfast items and more.

I can say yes, I am a fan of the brunch, I thought all their food items were of fantastic quality; the chicken and waffles was delicious, egg salad sandwhichw as just wow!; seafood items cooked to perfection and every other item on the buffet was even better than the next.  

The cons:  Colette seems to miss the mark on a few details that would otherwise land them a perfect 5 star rating from myself and probably many other reviewers.

Service:  Service is good however not refined for a fine dining brunch experience; servers don't pay attention to empty coffee cups. When you ask for coffee it is poured messily and end up splating on the table. Not what you'd expect from a brunch that is more expensive than the King Edward Hotel.

Food:  Hot dishes such as the roast beef did not come with gravy or horse radish.  No hot vegetables to pair either.  Bread was out for people to cut themselves which is fine, however, they didn't provide a cloth to cover the bread to everyone touched it with their bare hands as they helped themselves to a slice.  Many items in the buffet were not provided with utensils to pick them up.  Shrimp, shanwhiches, etc had to be picked up with patrons bare hands.  Lastly, I came here at 10am and by the time we were leaving around 12:30pm they had not replenished many of the items we got to each ex. the egg salad sanwhich was just replenished with more of the ham sandwich.

The washrooms did not have any soap which was kind of gross considering people had to cut bread with their bare hands.

Nonetheless the food here is very very good and I would recomend going if you like sunday brunches."}
{"text":"Came here for a private shindig....great decor, the hostesses seemed like they'd be more comfortable  serving patrons at a lounge/nail salon than a bistro. But that's the trend these days At some of the dt establishments. Snacked on this and that, didn't have a meal. While ppl were polite, overall this place seems like it is trying hard......way hard. This ain't no Bar Buca (walking distance). 

Overall verdict: Pretentious"}
{"text":"Fist time here, find it through winterlicious. We arrived on time but kept waiting for more than half hour. Unexpectedly the front desk staff offered complimentary drink (non alcohol) which is very nice. The food is OK, not really impressive. The service is more impressive than the food. All the staffs have silmes on their faces,  quite cheerful. After the deserts the complimentary drink seems been forgotten... We asked and our waiter quickly checked with the front desk and then the drink were on our table in 5 min. 
Appreciated all the service!"}
{"text":"Tried the Sunday brunch with some girlfriends.  The space is gorgeous, so bright and airy.  The hostesses kindly checked our coats and we were promptly brought to our table.  The buffet spread is one of the best brunch ones I've seen, maybe I'm partial because I'm a big seafood lover and there's an array of fresh seafood!  Crab and lobster claws, shrimp and smoked salmon.  The croissant was my next facouurite, so big, buttery and fluffy, reminded me of Paris.  The other pastries were good.  I tried roasted rack of lamb.  I tried an omelette too but it was just okay.  The other food was very nice.  Definitely recommend for a special outing as it isn't cheap but you pay for the quality.  The fresh orange juice was also delicious."}
{"text":"I've eaten here four times. Two dinners, 1 lunch and 1 brunch. The first time was for my 30th birthday. They mucked up the meal badly, but kindly sent me a generous gift card afterwards which I found to be quite classy (and also the reason I went back). The next visit was for brunch, which was by far the best meal I had at Colette. The brunch wasn't nearly as good as Le Select or Antler IMO, but it was good. The lunch and dinner visits that followed were both very poor. Food was fine but not memorable. Service was spotty. Wine was not great but I'll own that as perhaps we chose wrong. There are so many great restaurants in Toronto that I find it quite disappointing to eat mediocre food that's especially pricey. I will say that the ambiance is really lovely, can't knock the decor. If you're going to eat at the Thompson, I would recommend the diner over Colette."}
{"text":"Came here for Brunch on a Sunday, it was only buffet for around $50 a person plus tax and tips.  You get unlimited coffee, tea, juice - orange, grapefruit or mixed. There was lobster but when we sat down it was mostly gone and they were did not  refill it.  Missed out on the lobster tails as I saw people grabbing 2-3 each on their plates.  We did get some lobster from the claws (It was all taken out by the worker and sat on a bowl). The french toast was great as well.  All the others is just so-so.  Service was great they refold your napkin each time you left and brought you new fork and spoons.  I still don't think it was worth the money thou.  Good to try it once and be done with it."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of this place is quite cute.  

Food is good. I really enjoyed it!  They de-shell the crab claw for you, have huge pcs of shrimp, Salad selection is quite nice and I really enjoyed the dessert here as well.  Presentation in the buffet area is quite nice as well.

The service here is so-so.  My server was nice at the beginning of our meal but then had a bit of attitude near the end.  He was still polite nonetheless, but it really seemed like he didn't want to be there."}
{"text":"this place was terrible. they made us wait a half hour for our table, which then in turn made us miss out on all the crab and salmon. They should not run out of crab and salmon at 3 if they at open til 5pm. I shouldnt pay 75 because I am a larger group if all the food I am paying for is gone. I do not pay 75$ to get scraps. This is not worth the money, even at 54$ buffet price versus 75$."}
{"text":"Most amazing Sunday brunch - aside from specific seating policies - where people can reserve specific tables... I loved it!

The lobster salad, French toast and Eggs Benedict were to die for! 

Our server was lovely and I highly recommend to anyone looking for a luxury brunch experience."}
{"text":"Excellent brunch, service is very good. Lots of food to choose, very good taste. Definitely come back again."}
{"text":"The food was great. But $20 for bacon, eggs and toast? That seems a little ridiculous to me. This place has potential. Very cool layout and great service. But unjustifiable prices and boring menu."}
{"text":"I would definitely call this place more of a french fusion restaurant if any... It was quite good though. The place and ambiance is an admiring factor for me. Fiance and I went here for our anniversary dinner and were treated so well. 
The food was unbelievable and the service was quite good... but the bar is a little slow. To be honest, their pastries weren't that mind blowing, either. I've had better."}
{"text":"It took us a while to head to this very popular spot that happens to be close to our neighbourhood, wish we'd come sooner, but life with a toddler limits the date lunches with your spouse, hopefully that will change soon. Back to the point;
Walk in and you are greeted by a very friendly server guiding you to your seat, we choose to sit outside on this beautiful fall day.
The space is clean and classy; what you would expect from such place.
We order white wine by the glass, it is spot on, fresh and beautifully chilled.
For food, we go with oysters, beef tartare, mushroom a la creme and the mussels. 
Oysters are a balance of east and west coast. Now, we eat oysters everywhere, and the oysters here are stellar, one of the best in the city, especially the west coast, perfectly creamy. 
Beef tartare is excellent, perfectly diced. 
The mushroom a la creme is simple and elegant, perfect dish size. 
And the mussels, oh the mussels. We're from a city that is surrounded by sea, and we know our mussels and I've rarely had mussels this well cooked. This is my new fave!
I don't ever comment on the prices in such place because I trust that the establishment knows what they're doing, and this is the case here. 
Our first alone time in 5 months ends with amazing notes on our taste buds. 
Love, love, love."}
{"text":"We came here last night at 7:30 to have a drink and eat.  

The good.
It is beautiful inside and has a very Parisian feel to it.

The Bad.
The several people at the reception, who were not very welcoming, asked if we had a reservation and we said no.  They said they could not help us.  They made no effort to even attempt to accommodate us even though the restaurant was half empty.  The patio was also completely empty.  We returned a few hours later after we ate dinner elsewhere to have a nightcap, and the patio was still empty except for one table, and they had around 20 open tables on it. It was impossible to get anyone's attention at the bar and finally flagged down a passing waiter to order a drink from the bar. 

Anyway, I know the place is new, and I will give it a second chance, so I do plan on trying it again and I will increase my rating if service improves."}
{"text":"This review applies to the buffet brunch. This was a last ditch effort to get to a spot that takes reservations as most of the spots were jam packed for a weekday somehow (holiday week could explain this phenomenon)  
I had this spot bookmarked for a few of their brunch a la carte items which were somehow missing on this trip. Luckily the option for buffet was enticing so out group decided to go this way.
Now mind you this is no Vegas style buffet (not a fan of those with one exception) as the selection is limited (from what I read there are more options on the weekend) . Thankfully what they had a was decent and the few dessert options were done well. First the space it is nice and airy with a bright feel. 
I tried a few items so will address those
French Onion soup was decent and flavorful. The chicken burger was a bit ho hum and a bit on the cold side. Didn't try the quiche but the other DC's mentioned it being average.
Smoked salmon dishes were decent.  Shrimps were decent. 
I enjoyed the root vegetable and squash dishes as they were done well. The beet salad was forgettable as the beets were cut into such huge chunks one had cut through them several times to make them edible. 
The desserts were decent to great. The cake in particular was worth a mention . Creme brulee was decent as well. I didn't try the berry parfait but apparently they were quite good. Decent selection of fresh fruit as well. Service is good as we were checked on regularly. Now maybe it was a weekday brunch (Friday) as the price was very reasonable for a smorgasbord of food (weekend is more from what I understand) and very close to what one expects to pay in this area. I think I will be back to try out their other brunch and meal options."}
{"text":"Colette is just about the cutest restaurant in Toronto. I've never been to France, but the interior of Colette hits you with such a European romanticism that you might instantly fall in love with the place. I've been to this restaurant TWICE: Winterlicious 2016 and Winterlicious 2017. As expected, you might NOT get full because their portions are small, but Colette is definitely worth trying. I went for dinner the first time and lunch the second. I would say the lunch menu is better than their second. I would love to go back for their brunch or just lunch in general. Neat location, the food is good, the servers are friendly and I really like the aesthetics of the restaurant."}
{"text":"My friend made the suggestion to check out Colette. I made reservations the night before and was greeted by a friendly hostess and the front of the house manager who led us to a really nice seat by the window with a great view of the CN tower. 

The decor was really on point. Classic elegant cafe with decent space between your table and the other patrons. The menu was limited but prob done intentionally to minimize any issues with fresh ingredients and kitchen capacity. Portions were decent but sides had to be purchased separately. Had the eggs Benedict and side of potatoes (not the best but it came out warm). Water and coffee were never topped. My daughter had the French toast but other than the topper it was dry. 

The biggest issue was service. Our waitress was extremely unattentive and not friendly. She was a meal taker and not a server. She didn't top our beverages and we had to ask the manager at one point to order a round of drinks. The food runner had to grab things from the kitchen for us to start our meals and again she wasn't around. Waitress did not do a quality check otherwise she would  notice that the eggs in my Benedict were over cooked. Our plates sat empty in front of us for 15 minds before a random employee noticed we were waiting for some sort of attention. We waited another 20 mins at the end of our service to ask for the bill which then we waited another 10 mins before she showed up for payment. 


Food 5/10
Service 1/10 
Ambiance 7/10 

Overall 
A bit overrated for my taste and I won't be coming back. Good for those who want to come off as a foodie and take \"nice\" pictures for social media. Saw a few girls who made the effort to do their hair and makeup to take pics with their high end cameras. That's the crowd you get. I think I could score a better brunch experience elsewhere in the city. Best part of the meal was our seat. I think it was the only table worth sitting at if you enjoy a semi view of something besides other tables."}
{"text":"We heard a lot about this place and were somewhat disappointed. Lemon scone had a great texture, caramel macaron seemed like proper macaron, but the flavour wasn't so good. Peach Danish was not good: cheese tasted fake and peach was too soft and tasteless, but croissant dough is very good. I would go for a plain or almond croissant next time.
I absolutely loved their interior. Great design and feels cozy."}
{"text":"Highly recommend.  This was such a wonderful surprise. I loved this restaurant- The decor was highly appealing and the service was great!  But best of all,The food was fantastic. The French bakery was outstanding -best almond croissant in the city!  We had the lunch buffet (which was something new they had just started the day we went in).  The selections were excellent and not like any other normal buffet; shrimp, salmon, gourmet sandwiches, beautiful salads, quiche, cheeses etc. amazing value based on what they were offering (I think it was $25 or $29 per person).  Everything was top notch. it is not an inexpensive restaurant, but worth every penny."}
{"text":"Yelp says they are open till 11pm. This is my second time visiting them this week and the bakery closed at 9:50. I ended up buying a cheesecake and they served it even though the bakery was closed but I was too disappointed to enjoy it. Great servers though."}
{"text":"I went to Colette for lunch last week on a weekday. 

My friend and I loved the decor, very french and feminine. We also really enjoyed the food. 

The buffet had shrimp, a variety of sandwiches and wraps and salads as well as cured meats and cheese. For around $25 (all you can eat) this is a great deal!

I had the shrimp cocktail, which is not such a great deal as it is the same shrimp as the buffet and was like $16. But my club sandwich was PHENOMENAL. There was the usual chicken bacon and cheese but there was also a tomato sauce so it was like a cross between pizza and a club sandwich and it really worked. 

The service was a bit on the slow side. It took the servers a while to refill our water and take our order. 

There are beautiful looking pastries in the adjacent bakery. We didn't have any, but I'm sure they're delicious. 

I will definitely return to Colette."}
{"text":"I came here with my friends over the weekend and I really wasn't impressed. The food was mediocre and overpriced.  The good news is our waiter was very nice and friendly. 

All of our entrées were not the best. One friend ordered a chicken entrée, my other friend ordered a pasta and I ordered a gluten free option (the only thing I could eat), which was not on the menu.

I found my small salad with a tiny fillet of salmon to be overpriced and bland. It had some nuts thrown on top but had no substance. It was nothing special and was lacking nutritious vegetables.

I feel like Colette could cater to the lactose and gluten free market a bit better. I then ordered a mix of fruit for dessert. My fruit plate arrived and it was extremely small for the $12.00 price. How hard is it to put strawberries and apples on a plate?

My friends ordered the chocolate soufflé and they said it was terrible. Their faces said it all. At Colette, they make the soufflé from scratch when it is ordered and it is supposed to be amazing. We waited over an hour for their dessert and it was a huge disappointment.

The Positives:
- Nice Employees
- Great Ambiance

The Negatives:
- Mediocre Food
- Overpriced
- Long Wait Times

All over, I would not return to Colette for a meal. I might go if I just want to sip a glass of wine on a relaxing date."}
{"text":"Stunning decor. Enjoy it and leave. 

Grossly inattentive service. Person really looked like she didn't want to be there."}
{"text":"As we walked in to the reception area, the first thing I thought, \"we're not in Toronto any more\". Wow, what an ambiance, well decorated, and you're almost immediately faced with the luxurious and sweeping buffet. Maybe I just don't get out enough, but Colette's really looked like it was whisking us away, far from the chill of the city, far from Toronto. 

We were at Colette's for Sunday Brunch, and it was wonderful. We were a large group (12), and the service from the time we arrived until the time we left, was outstanding. Very attentive and helpful throughout. 

The buffet required 4 plates, at least that's how it was for me. First plate was a bit of a sampler from the cold dishes, and the salmon wellington - very yummy. The roast beef was a little over done for my taste, but was nice none-the-less. 

Second plate - yea, the carbs. Bring on the fried chicken and waffles, smothered in maple syrup - oh yea. I could have eaten that all day. French toast with all the accouterments was excellent as well. 

Third plate - eggs Benedict, served fresh to the table, was terrific and perfectly prepared, nice and runny. I've never had salmon under my eggs, and it was very nice for a change. But what really made it was the croissant the eggs were perched on. Melt in your mouth, I'll never want to see an English muffin under my eggs Bene again!

Fourth plate - desserts were all very nice. A sweet selection, and just enough to send us on our way.

My only complaint: some of the food ran out, and we had to wait for refills on things like bacon, waffles and fried chicken, creme brulee, you know, the staples. And in some cases we had to point out the empty trays to the staff. That really isn't cool, especially for a brunch set up. Were it not for that, this review would have been 5 stars. 

All in all, very enjoyable, and looking forward to returning one day."}
{"text":"One word, WOW! The food, the sweets, the coffee and the staff, wow! 

My only issue, which is why i didn't give it a full 5 stars, i felt a bit uncomfortable watching the person making my coffee get put down by some jerk in a suit. ."}
{"text":"3 stars for the food and +1 star for service and ambiance.

My friends and I wanted to grab Friday dinner but everywhere seemed to be booked full so we decided to go to Colette, which probably is more popular during brunch/lunch times. It was pretty empty when we first entered but it got a bit busier as the night progressed. We sat by the front patio so that we could take advantage of the full menu, as we decided that we were all too hungry for just finger food (the back patio is for tapas only). The ambiance was nice with pretty flowers and plants decorating the area.

The halibut I ordered was moist, not overcooked, with a very delicate green sauce around it. The dish was very light and summer-like but I don't think I was blown away by the flavours. However, the concept was interesting and thought the spelt was a unique touch. It was aesthetically pleasing to look at though! 

My party sat there were a long time because the place wasn't packed and I appreciated how I didn't feel the rush to leave, even once our drinks were almost done. The service was very attentive and I overall had a great evening at Colette!"}
{"text":"I was SO excited to come here to try the sunday buffet brunch.  The pictures online looked fantastic for the snow crab legs and the shrimp cocktail.  I was SO incredibly disappointed.  The place itself is super cute and beautiful, but that's about it.  French cooking? I don't think so.  The food was horrible and the selection was slim.  After living in Paris for just under 3 years, I can assure you that the pastries here are crap.  Maybe I need to come back and try their regular menu because often buffet quality is lower, but I don't think I will ever come back.  The salads were boring,  soup was EXTREMELY salty, ribs were dry, croissants were dry/hard, desserts were horrible.  They post pictures online of their snow crab legs and it appears to be a large tray.  But in reality they took out only a little at a time (about 15 or so).  I hate when a restaurant misleads you with their pictures.  

The best part was the mushroom egg benny, omlettes and sweet crepes.  Everything else was nothing to be excited about.  NOT worth the $54.  Also I'm pretty sure their \"freshly squeezed\" OJ and grapefruit juice is not 100% real juice.  They were bringing it out in HUGE jugs and refilling it like no tomorrow.  But yet I didn't see a juicing station anywhere.  I am sure this is a lie. So even though I want to give 2 stars for the fab decor, I can't.  DO NOT come here.  It is not authentic good french cooking and it is not quality for the price you pay."}
{"text":"Colette is exquisite. The food, the ambiance, the cocktails. Makes for a beautiful evening out or brunch. I've had an array of dishes all recommended by my server each time and always enjoyed their high quality and authentic cuisine. The only thing that could be a bit better is the service, sometimes our servers are amazing; other times so-so. Will definitely be back, love this place!"}
{"text":"Very good service, solid food and great ambiance. An \"occasion\"y type place. Came on a Saturday around 2:30 and make the cut to have brunch without a reservation. The classic with the croissant was a great choice. Ordered their in house bacon, but wasn't up to my standard of bacon, still fine though. MyS/O ordered the burger, was solid, cheese was good. I appreciated the $9 mimosa special. Super nice and attentive staff. Instagram friendly place; understand why bridal or baby showers are here."}
{"text":"My first time being at Colette's Grand Café  I was expecting great things especially with the reviews I read. We went on a Sunday Brunch and we were promised that the food would always be replenished and that was not the case. One of the food I never even got to taste was the Oysters and that is just an example. The seating we got was extremely cramped that it was frustrating just to move around. We also got 2 glasses that were apparently dirty. Also, the place was so hot inside that we could not eat in comfort at all. For the amount I paid which is quite pricey my experience should reflect the price I paid and unfortunately it missed the mark."}
{"text":"Came during a weekend lunch with my girls. We loved this place. It was not very busy during the lunch time. People started to come in at afternoon tea time. 

We were very pleased on what we have ordered. 

Goat cheese soufflé $16 was a surprise. It's savoury. It's fluffy. I even like the salad. 

Besides the soufflé, I have to recommend their halibut $32 and duck breast $24.

 Entrecôte & fries  were ok. 

$32 is pricy for a lunch entree. But who cares when a dish is so good."}
{"text":"Trendy.  Very trendy.  Came here for a dessert date with a dear friend on a Wednesday evening.  It turns out we were severely under dressed.  The maitre' d was en pointe and looked after our orders thoughtfully but our server was just doing her job.  I had the burger which was good and my friend had the mushroom soup which looked tasty.  It is good but not outstanding.  Then we got the dessert chocolate soufflé for two.  They made a great show of pouring the creme anglais but in the end the taste was underwhelming.  Definitely paid for the trendy ambiance.  

Inasmuch as this place is sooo pretty I think I am ok not to come here again."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to visit Colette Cafe, but never got the opportunity to until recently.  The Cafe is adorable! French inspired from the exterior to the interior decorations, that remind me of an indoor garden.  Everyone who works there are extremely friendly and professional.  When I came here, I specifically went to the Cafe area where it was more casual and lounge-like.  They had a take-out area where they served coffee, macaroons, pastries, and sandwiches/wraps.  I had their 8oz latte and their turkey bacon with apple sandwich.  The sandwich was delicious and flavourful, which I highly recommend.  I thought the apples would be a weird as I'm not usually a fan of savoury and sweet but the apples compliment the flavours of the sandwich so well.  The coffee that they serve is creamy, smooth and freshly brewed.  They even add nice coffee art to every cup.  Even though the Cafe is a take-out area, if you are eating in, they will bring your food over to your table, which is nice. They also offer free wi-fi and they have extremely comfy lounge chairs and throw pillows, that makes you want to stay at the Cafe for hours and hours!  (I stayed there for 4 hours, no problem.)  I'm definitely coming back here and I would love to try their dining experience the next time."}
{"text":"Brunch Review: 
Great atmosphere and design, but the food although good (only ok I would say) certainly lacklustre. 
We had very friendly service but a bit slow.
Don't bother going if you don't have a reservation, they'll even give you a bit of an attitude at the door. Had to go through hoops to make a reservation called several times before anyone even answered and they only leave a bar area for walk-ins."}
{"text":"Fantastic Sunday brunch location! Pretty great selections at buffet.. staff replenished food quickly (everything except oysters). You also order a personalized crepe / omelette from your table.  really good.  As all the others say.. very ig worthy.. one of the prettiest restaurants i've been!  We had to book 3 weeks in advance for a 2 person table.. so plan ahead!"}
{"text":"Yet another Chase Hospitality Group restaurant.  Stunning interiors, gorgeous patio that overlooks the park and really makes you feel like you're in Paris.  Croissants are top notch - one of the best I've had in North America.  Macarons come in good flavors (finally, someone who does a passion fruit macaron SANS milk/dark chocolate - ewww!).  

I would go elsewhere for dinner though.  A month after they opened I went for dinner and it was nothing special, not to mention that I had to \"babysit\" our server as I had to prompt her for things throughout the entire night.  Ugh!

Had the Moules Frites and the fries were so crispy they tasted like they tasted more like the texture of Hickory Sticks.  I like 'em crispy - but this... NON!  The liquid from the mussels WAS very good and I would've sopped it all up with the bread had it not been STALE tasting (um... so much for the Collete Grand Café and BAKERY) part :(

The fish was okay but again nothing wowed.  We also end up ordering a selection of desserts from the bakery which were again a letdown.  Very one-dimensional and not a heck of a lot of layers of flavor.

The wine list, however, is stellar and offers up some yummy wines.

Take home message: Come for the CROISSANT and MACARONS.  Go elsewhere for everything else :p"}
{"text":"Came to enjoy the Sunday Brunch.  Service was pleasant and attentive.  Decent food selection including seafood and charcuterie.  Less impressive was the dessert which, given the inhouse pâtisserie, one would have expected to be the marque feature.  Sadly, the dining experience suffers from the \"little details\" such as completely running out of condiments to accompany the shrimp cocktail, and then once again with the prime rib.  Atmosphere and decor were the redeeming qualities."}
{"text":"The cafe has been removed and replaced by the \"petit dejeuner\" monday to friday. I was told that it was due to poor foot traffic and other cafes opening up nearby. I really liked the light breakfast buffet and have taken my kids a few times. Today was not the same experience. The four of us sat down and wasn't served or even noticed. The restaurant was pretty empty. The server at the bar served a gentleman right away and then looked at us. I've NEVER been treated that way before at colette and have been a patron since they opened. I will never return. I got up and walked straight to Oretta Cafe.  Oretta has such a beautiful natural vibe without pretentious staff who overlook patrons. great food and service.  So long Colette!



THIS WAS MY ORIGINAL REVIEW! 

I've only been to colette for coffee and treat breaks, but I must say...this place is divine.  A short walk from my work, and I feel like I'm somewhere else entirely.  The parisian ambiance is spot on. The roasted hazelnut chocolate croissant is to die for, or was is the coconut raspberry...or was it he chocolate? Haha best croissants ever."}
{"text":"Colette is a little piece of Paris hidden in the streets of Toronto. 

If you're longing for an authentic macaron or a beautifully curated selection of teas and decor, Colette is your destination. Every time I'm looking for a quick coffee break, meeting place, or a place to de-stress Colette is on the top of my list. Their desserts and cappuccinos are beautifully made and the staff are extremely friendly and welcoming.

They often even remember your order if you happen to strike a conversation or two. 

Highly recommend coming here for a couple coffees or cocktails with your friends. Don't forget your camera."}
{"text":"Their orange juice is delicious!!!! Went for their brunch buffet. Lots to choose from! Wide selection for all different palettes including custom ordered omelets and beef wellington! I would come here often, if I wanted to spend $55/head. I had come for a special occasion."}
{"text":"I visited Colette for my birthday brunch a few Saturdays back in August. Great menu, beautiful presentation and delicious food. We had the pancakes, turkey sandwich and omelette. Something as small as picking up the phone after one ring, and treating us to champagne and dessert for my birthday makes all the difference. This experience will surely put Colette at the top of my list for future event venues!"}
{"text":"I came here with generally low expectations given the poor service that pervades trendy, new, corporate-owned restaurants in Toronto. I have to admit I was wrong. The staff here were warm, friendly and competent. I expected the typical blank, expressionless stare from the hostess, but she was friendly and made conversation while brining us to our table.

The waitstaff was equally competent and every dish was thoroughly explained when presented to the table. The food and presentation was excellent. The restaurant itself is beautiful and it is obvious that no expense was spared. The operation was a little awaked at times but I'm assuming this is just growing pains as the staff settle in. It was not busy at all when we attended so I'm interested to see how smoothly it runs with a packed house. Judging by my experiences so far, I expect everything will work out well into the future.

Also, for such a grand-looking French restaurant, I was a little surprised at the limited wine line. I expected something more. However, corkage is available for $30 a bottle for wine aficionados who have a good selection at home.

I will likely return at some point in the future and possibly up my rating depending on how the operation settles in. My only concern is the location of this restaurant. It will likely become an expense account hotspot -- a place to see and be seen. Unfortunately, this usually results in attracting the typical, classless King West types that frequent restaurants in the neighbourhood. The hotel in which the restaurant is located also seems to be extremely popular with the Gucci-t-shirt/sunglasses-indoors-type, so this will likely detract from the atmosphere. Will this place be a fine dining establishment or a local hot spot? Time will tell, I'm sure."}
{"text":"We came here for Sunday Brunch. It's been a long time since I've been wanting to bring my parents here, to show them a brunch that's worthy of $50 (as opposed to their usual place). They are really picky, but even though they would have a hard time admitting it, they enjoyed it. (except I think we are back at our usual place because its closer to them and seating is more comfy). 

We sat in the nice open solarium area. It was cozy, but we were still able to fit a stroller.  The wait staff was excellent. 5 stars. I haven't seen an establishment that does things this well. My water and coffee were never empty. Plates were cleared quickly and utensils replaced. They were friendly, courteous and even responded to my dad's many requests. It seems so simple, but not a lot of places do things well. 

The buffet was great. My stomach is small. (sad face). 
There's an omelette station, made to order and brought to your table. You could also order an eggs benedict (something no one told us until we saw it). There was a salmon wellington, and a roast beef. Scrambled eggs, Sausage, French Toast. Bacon. 
Then there is the huge salad bar of yummy things. A lobster salad that I couldn't stop eating, and shrimp cocktail. Smoked salmon and cheeses, with grapes. 
If you still have room, dessert was amazing too.

You can also get baked goods in the bakery attached. 

I think it would be a great place for a special occasion or family gathering."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the Sunday brunch here very much. It's a very cozy place. Apparently it's not easy to book. Although the restaurant was full, the service was still very attentive. 

The buffet style brunch offered a good variety of food selections. The croissant was fresh. The salmon Wellington was baked to perfection. The oysters were small but sweet. The snow crab legs were meaty and tasty. Note that they were gone very fast! You have to keep an eye on it and go get them when they bring them out from the kitchen."}
{"text":"Great spot for a Sunday brunch! The food tasted amazing and the service was impeccable. The DIY French onion soup, chocolate-dipped orange peels and croissants are a must-try."}
{"text":"Sometimes we need a little French... Whether it's the culture or the kiss. Colette, located in the Thompson hotel is a relatively new spot. They opened October of 2014. The decor is exceptionally authentic with marble and wood shipped from France... Actually, that might make it more authentic than a restaurant in Paris. But I digress.

The restaurant reminds me of a romantic painting, of sunny afternoons gone by. It is a great spot for brunch or a nice luncheon with the matriarch of the family or a place to break bad or celebratory news.

The food is expensive, but no more than your standard fare at any decent French restaurant... So why 3 stars you ask, it was the food. It tried but for me, I wasn't en amour (in love). I had their mushroom soup, which I found too acidic. It should have come with a nice crostini but was fairly naked. I tried their mozzarella pear salad... More cheese than salad but the almost baked pears made that dish. I also ordered the Brussels sprout sides with beef tongue. The beef tongue reminded me more of spam than anything else but the lightly fried potatoes were a winner.

Finally, the macarons... Not macaroons... Macarons. They are professed to be the best in Toronto... I'm not sure. It is true they aren't overly sweet but they tend to be denser and I like my macaron to be light and airy with the right crumbliness as I bite into those colourful cookies.

Ah. To be at la Durée!"}
{"text":"Firstly - what a fantastic space! So bright and open - reminded me of Paris for sure!its all in the details - white & blue decor, marble tables, specialized plateware - impressive! Visited here for my birthday (easy choice, since we share the same name) and it was by far the best birthday meal I have ever had - and definitely up there as one of my top food experiences! Fantastic menu - if you are not adventurous or do not enjoy French cuisine, obviously this is not the place for you. Staff & management were very friendly and knowledgable - service was impeccable - I felt like royalty!
I would definitely recommend the Foie Gras 3 ways - the brûléed mousse is the best thing you'll ever have. 
Chase Hospitality is definitely doing something right - it was not evident at all that it had only been open for a few weeks. I'm definitely coming back to visit the bakery for some bread and macaroons - delicious!"}
{"text":"We came here Wednesday night for 515pm and the restaurant wasn't very busy.  There is a parking directly across from the restaurant and underground beneath the Thompson Hotel. The parking was $15.  The hostess greeted us and took us to our table. Our server Thomas was quite friendly and attentive. The restaurant has a Parisian feel with a nice intimate setting. The menu had a good selection of appetizers and entrees. We ordered the French onion soup and large Chopped salad to start. The soup had fried onions instead of the traditional cooked onions which was a. Ice change. It gave the soup more depth and texture. The cheese was layered at the bottom of the bowl instead of the top which is wheee it normally sits in other restaurants that I have been to. For the main we ordered then trout and duck confit.  The trout was very tasty but a little under cooked (it came with two fillets). We told Thomas the situation and he apologized and hurrily brought it back to have it cooked more thoroughly. When he brought the plate back with the trout the presentation did not disappoint and looked liked a brand new piece of fish.  For the desert we ordered 1 to share....it was a puff pastry with hazelnut ice cream and chocolate sauce all over it.  Overall we had a very nice dinner and found the ambiance nice, warm and cozy. The service was very good and will come back to try their lunch menu."}
{"text":"I had reserved this restaurant on Opentable weeks ago, to celebrate a special occasion with my family. We arrived at our reservation time of 12:30 on a Sunday.  I was told by the hostess that our table would soon be ready.  I sat down with the other members of my party and waited. After 15 minutes the manager came over and apologized but did not suggest how much longer we might be waiting--no offer of a glass of wine, prosecco or anything while we waited. I asked if I could have a coffee--never came. Another 10 minutes passed and my adult daughter went to the hostess and asked when we would be seated and they said we were next on the \"list\"! My daughter rightfully angry, replied that we should not have been on a waiting list-we had a bona fide reservation. We could see a table for four that was empty and was being cleaned and still held a hope that they would tell us that we were to be taken to the table imminently.  Instead they had the gall to seat a newly arrived group of 3 people who arrived around the same time as my daughter's complaint. At 1pm, outraged with what had occurred I stopped at the hostess desk on my way out to complain and she said that she had to do what the manager told her to do.  He was nowhere in sight as we departed, but I did return in a few minutes later when I saw him at the desk, to let him know how pathetic his management was. 
He returned a very feeble apology and promised to seat me THEN???! 
I think not, I think never."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come here for the brunch buffet for the longest time since I've seen so many pictures of the exquisite food. I was disappointed when I visited this weekend. The variety was a lot less than I expected. There was only about 2 small stations and not a lot of variety. The first station had normal breakfast items like French toast, waffles, bacon, sausage, potatoes, and salmon Wellington which I thought was pleasantly good. The second station had more French style foods. The only things I thought was decent was the grilled cheese, crab claws and meat and cheese board. The dessert station was not good at all. The macarons tasted old and the desserts were either too sweet or lack flavour. Not to mention they also had customize omelettes and crepes. The omelettes were okay .. nothing special and the crepes were horrible. No fresh fruit or anything on the crepe. It looked like they smudged Nutella and raspberry jam on a crepe. Also, the service was not great, our waiter was not happy to be there and was not helpful at all. He was never really in sight when we needed something. I would not come back here for brunch especially when it cost $54.99 per person before tax and tip. I was not impressed with the quality and quantity of food."}
{"text":"Came here for after dinner drinks and dessert. It was a pretty happening place. Desserts were great, though a little pricey. I'd come back though. Recommended."}
{"text":"Went on Saturday for winterlicious. It was amazing!!
The appetizer took me so long to finish! The smoked salmon was made with beet juice and not as salty as the one we normally eat. The squid f the main course was nicely cooked not too chewy but still being really tender. The desert was having lemon custard and rum puff with cream. A little bit sour from the lemon but not over powering. It was good for the ending. 

The interior space was highly decorated, there is a lot of details and patterns for the entire restaurant. The waitresses are being really friendly and have enough knowledge about each dishes. 

Really enjoy the time here and for sure will come back for Sunday brunch!!!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch with some friends recently.  Very friendly and attentive staff.  Very classy decor.  The food was excellent and they had a large variety.  I would recommend this place to anyone who doesn't mind splurging a bit."}
{"text":"Colette is beautifully decorated - I love the blue Parisian theme with the arched walkways, sumptuous seats and floral arrangements. The service that we received was excellent. Sunday brunch is definitely worth coming for - we initially came to try out the Summerlicious menu but was told that they did not offer Summerlicious courses on a Sunday. We decided to stay instead of leaving (given that we made an effort to dress up for brunch), and boy were we glad that we stayed! Everything that we had was perfectly cooked and to die for! I thought I was going to knock out after having my vegetarian crepes covered in hollandaise sauce...thankfully I still had enough room for dessert! All in all, our mistake turned out to be a blessing in disguise - I really enjoyed my experience at Collette and I am looking forward to future visits!"}
{"text":"The service was very friendly and the brunch buffet was very delicious and amazing. Yes the price is expensive at $55 but it's quite worthy it since they have fresh seafood and yummy dishes"}
{"text":"I came here with friends to celebrate a birthday, and loved it! 
Their décor and food is French, and is classy/fancy.

I really enjoyed the foie gras dish; creative presentation, and perfectly tender. Melt in your mouth goodness!

Their soufflé was presented very well; the waitress poured a chocolate cream sauce onto it, which was perfect against the batter.

Any of their small desserts are good, and almost too pretty to eat! 

Service was VERY professional, polite, and I really liked their uniforms. Great birthday experience!"}
{"text":"This place is perfect: sunny high ceiling with dainty decor and thematic sections, basically instagrammers' heaven.

We came here for sunday brunch and really really really enjoyed the experience and enjoyed the food (the number of really matters here!!). For the food, the dishes were hit or miss, while all the salads, especially the roasted eggplants, were delectable. Their fresh shrimp salad was out of this world with huge plump shrimps! The hot dishes left more to be desired for the price: their french onion soup was too salty, their salmon wellington was too dry. 

Overall, go for the atmosphere and some of the food."}
{"text":"There was so much hype about this place - from the tv interview back in Jul 2014 of the owners on bikes offering their pastries downtown before the place first opened, to the features on blogto and the like, to the pictures all over instagram - that I was thrilled to finally try out their Sunday brunch. My sister had warned me it would be $54pp. The site doesn't say and it's been awhile now so I don't recall specifics, but it was around there.

The food was alright. In the pictures on the site, it looked much more grand, like an endless display of scrumptious entrées and desserts. The reality consisted of two sections: one for diy omelette, pancakes/french toast & toppings, roast beef, salmon wellington, sausage/bacon/etc; another smaller one for wraps, salads, desserts. Don't get me wrong, the food wasn't bad. It's just that there was so much expectation coming in that I was surprised i wasn't blown away. (At least it wasn't like at Maman where I took one look and walked right out!)

The service and decor, now that's what makes up this place. The café is located under a condo but when you walk in, it's as if you're transported to Paris. (Or how we romanticize it in our heads.) The decor is absolutely beautiful and the ambience alone makes it worth visiting again. The service is impeccable. I've never had someone change my plate so many times during brunch or check on our table so often without it feeling like i was watched like a hawk, but we felt well attended to. I guess that's what you get for the price?"}
{"text":"What can I say... Novelty won me over! Would I do a $60+ brunch again? Probably not though, I WOULD come back for a few of these items on their own and perhaps a beverage or two :)

AMBIANCE/SERVICE
Absolutely gorgeous interior with high ceilings and regal decor. Our party of 6 made reservations in advance to try their AYCE Brunch. We were seated and provided waters promptly by our servers. THEN! OFF TO ROAM!

FOOD
+Salmon Wellington with the house creme fraiche - Outstanding dish. Loved the creme fraiche which paired really nicely with the flaky pastry which wrapped the salmon. 
+Dulce de leche creme puff - BEST item out of the entire dessert selection, this is coming from the girl who's tried every sweet thing there :p
+French toast with topping station (raspberry jam, chocolate drizzle, whipped cream, berries, sprinkles, sliced almonds, walnuts, maple syrup) - Forget the pancakes, do it up with Colette's french toast! 
+Lemon scones with raspberry jam - Delectable.
+Freshly squeezed juice - DO IT."}
{"text":"Colette Grande
I made reservations for my fiance and I to celebrate his birthday. We parked in the lot across the street for $10. On the outside, it doesn't look like much, but its really chic on the inside. When we entered, the host greeted us, asked us how we were, I mentioned we were great because we were celebrating his birthday. 

The staff was attentive and gave great personal recommendations. 

We ordered the foie gras as the starter. The mousse foie gras was great but my favorite was the brioche foie gras which just melts in your mouth. Totally worth ordering this trio!

The fish of the day was juicy, light and tender. The flavors all balanced well without over powering the natural taste of the fish.
My fiance got a really juicy, well-cooked chicken. I usually find most restaurants don't do chicken right, but they did fantastic here!

At the end, I asked to see the dessert menu and the waiter said he was waiting to see what they had left in terms of pastries in the back before he gave us the menu. He returned a couple of minutes later with a platter of 3 of his favorites from the dessert bar with a candle on a delicious lemon merengue on the house for the birthday boy. We never order lemon merengue it was perfect with the macarons were perfect. They wrote a birthday card for my fiance, which was the cherry on top.

By far, one of the best restaurants I have been to in a very long time. Highly recommend coming here. I cannot wait to do brunch here with some friends!"}
{"text":"It was summer of 2014 when Colette Grand Cafe made it's debut in Toronto, opening it's doors to King West socialites looking for modern French cuisine, polished tableware and french-country decorations. The newly opened restaurant debuted with a bakery-café, a lounge and a formal dining room. The bakery is open daily from 7am-6pm catering to the \"on-the-go\" crowds and coffee aficionados with a selection of delicious french-inspired goodies made daily. The lounge and dinning area are open for lunch and dinner on weekdays and dinner service on weekends. Crowds come and go to experience a dinning affair to remember in a place that boasts luxurious décor, comfortable sitting and perfectly put together wait staff. For those looking for a romantic night out, a late-night dinner with friends or simply a quiet drink with appies, Colette is the place to be and be seen.

The food is certainly one of those affairs to remember, with perfectly plated dishes, table bread that is buttery and a must-have, a menu that is well thought-out with dishes that are delicate on the palate yet explode with flavour on bite. Having had a fair share of French dishes, Colette impresses ones taste buds with brilliantly crafted meals, like the Tartare de Veau. A veal tartare delicacy made with fresh herb pistou (a Provençal cold sauce made from cloves of garlic, fresh basil and olive oil), horseradish, hard-boiled egg and grilled seeded sourdough.

And if classic dishes is what tickles your fancy, a highly recommended one is the Lobster Bisque. A decadent soup served with butter-poached lobster, parsnip purée, herbs and semolina dumplings with caramelized leeks. The dish screams modern French like no other.

For the not-so fancy crowd pleasers, look for a quick bite in L'Hamburger, one of the simplest yet tastiest dishes to go with and part of Colette's \"Plates de Résistance\". The infamous burger is served on a basil and chili compound butter with tomato horseradish condiment, crisp frites and aioli dusted with paprika.

Desserts on the other hand are truly the pièce de résistance at Colette. Having a full bakery on the premises does have its benefits, so desserts are never optional at this french-inspired restaurant.

The Soufflé aux Chocolat Pour Deux is the \"it\" dessert menu item. Taking close to 20 minutes to prepare as suggested by the chef, this warm soufflé with grand marnier crème anglaise is suggested as a dessert for two for its chocolaty decadence, rich flavours and fluffy batter.

And if looking for a less decadent dessert, be sure to check out the Vanilla Ice-Cream Profiteroles made with caramel cream and warm chocolate sauce. A small yet delicious treat that is sure to end ones meal with a voilà!

Buen Provecho,
Viviana."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch after Christmas on a weekday so my review is based on their regular brunch menu, not their sunday brunch buffet. We ordered the garlic escargots to share, duck confit, and turkey club sandwich. Our waitress was friendly but service was a bit slow because I'm guessing they were low on staff after the holidays, my suggestion is to come for dinner instead on lunch, honestly the lunch menu wasn't anything special, but the atmosphere was pretty amazing, service was great, nice decor but i don't judge food by their looks, taste-wise my food that day didn't have mucb taste in it . especially the escargots which almost tasted like raw garlic dunked in a pool of oil..no taste at all.  The toast on my grilled turkey club was a bit burnt, the sliced avocado in the sandwich was already brown when served. Duck confit was the best out of the 3 dishes, crispy skin & meat wasn't tough, sauce was good as well.  Will come back again for their Sunday brunch buffet and write another review."}
{"text":"Another try for this large space at The Thompson. I would not run to try it, but if you happen to be in the area and Le Select is full, you can count on good food. 

Pros:  the decor is beautiful and they really committed to the Parisian look. Makes the once cold and open space seem way more intimate.  Some great hits at our table including the Foie Gras three ways, Oysters and the fish special. Also some fun cocktails and a pretty nice wine list. 

Cons: soulless, felt like they were not quite owning it. Reminded me of the Vegas copy of a cool French restaurant rather than the real thing. Horrible front desk/ hostesses. We had a reservation for 8 and the place was quiet but they still managed to make us feel like we were annoying them by arriving. I highly recommend that they get a new front of house manager and replace the entire team at the desk. I would never bring clients again after they felt snubbed before we even sat down. 

Overall I am glad I tried it and may head back, but will not rush and don't recommend you do either. Maybe try it for a glass of wine and a snack?  Or a late lunch on the weekend."}
{"text":"This review is specifically tailored for their Sunday buffet brunch. 

The place itself is beautiful. Definitely somewhere I would want to take my mom for mothers day. Parisian style decor, very elegant. 

The wait staff is outstanding. The starts I gave were for the service. Excellent is an understatement. My water glass and cup of coffee was never empty and they would always come around when I was done with my plate. I love their uniforms as well. 

Now I come to the food. Although there is a lot of quantity, the quality is not present. My spouse and our friends all agreed that there was a lack of flavor in the food. The presentation of the buffet was beautiful though!  

There is a warm station where there was waffles, fried chicken, pancakes, french toast (this was my fave), sausage, bacon and bread pudding. The carving station had turkey, some salmon something that was incredibly bland and some various breads. There was an omelet and egg station where they would take your order, cook your requested item and bring it to your table. However, my husband said it wasn't good. Then there is a salad station, sandwiches (unlabeled! these things should be labeled for allergies, etc.) and then fruit and dessert. The creme puffs were pretty good. 

Everyone in our party agreed that the $54/pp was not worth the price AT ALL. 

I wanted to love this place so much, I really did! We booked the reservation 3 weeks in advance so perhaps we built up unrealistic expectations of the place."}
{"text":"Came here with a large group. Slowest meal I've ever had! The atmosphere and decoration was good. However I've been in meals with much larger groups and got served way faster. The food was ok. Do not recommend large groups to come here."}
{"text":"This place is beautiful! Everything starting from the decorations to the plates and cutlery was too quality. I honestly couldn't stop turning around to see what else they've got)))
The food in my opinion was good, but my friend said its nothing special. I found that they have pretty interesting selection, so I tried a little bit of almost everything. 
Excellent service as well. Our waiter was super nice and would refresh our drinks and plates just when we needed it. 
This place is very pricey, I paid close to a $100 for my brunch, but I think it was worth it. 
I will definitely be coming back here!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch.  Beautiful restaurant, brunch is served as a decadent buffet.  Very pricey but great for a special occasion!"}

I love the decor... All in all I really just love this place"}
{"text":"Breakfast review: Colette has a beautiful decor  it's a very cute restaurant to have breakfast on the patio and do work and drink your morning tea. 

Brunch review:  the ambiance makes you feel like your in paris, it has a very elegant touch. The all you can eat brunch is amazing! Lots of options which makes it worth what you pay so I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"My friend organized a pre-wedding celebration dinner at Colette Grand Cafe. The interior at Colette is very cute, the theme of our area is a tiffany-blue colour. It was a wonderful experience! Service was excellent, the staff were so friendly and attentive to our needs.

* FRENCH ONION SOUP (4.5/5)
(Sherry, sourdough, gruyère)
I loved the onion soup! A great portion of melted cheese and onion pieces. It came nice and hot. There were also fried onion pieces on the top, giving the soup more texture.

* STRIPLOIN & FRITES (4/5)
(Red wine butter & bordelaise jus)
Delish! I was surprised when our server didn't ask us how we wanted our meat but it was all good because my striploin came medium-rare, which I prefer. The fries were actually the highlight of the dish. Loved the dipping sauce as well!

* VANILLA ICE CREAM PROFITEROLE (5/5)
(Caramel cream & warm chocolate sauce)
My favourite part of the meal.. desserts! The ice cream was deep fried and it wasn't oily and overly filling. We were stuffed by the time the desserts came, but there's always room! Highly recommending this dessert - lots of flavour :)"}
{"text":"Food isn't anything special (although still delicious) but the staff and ambiance is so amazing that the price tag is 100% worth it. 100% recommend."}
{"text":"Came here for a bday brunch for 2 today, but didn't know it was a buffet. They should advertise this better on their website cause it's definitely a worthwhile place to go for a special occasion!


At $54 (not including tax) a person, you get unlimited coffee, fresh juices, and three buffet areas with assorted meat and cheeses, salads, seafood (lobster, crab meat, salmon, shrimp), breakfast food (sweet and savory crepes, bacon etc.), omelette table, soup, tons of desserts, assorted warm meats (roast beef and turkey), and fruits! 

The service was impeccable for us. When we were waiting for our table (we were walk-ins and only waited 5 mins for our table), there was a server that offered us crab legs while we waited. The staff was super nice. We stayed over 3 hours catching up and no one rushed us to finish. I told my server it was my friend's bday so she got her a slice of cake with a candle on it. Servers also helped us take some nice pics! Overall, I give the service A! 

The ambience was beautiful, like other reviewers said. People were really dressed up for brunch.

The meal is pricey, but the food is good. I would come back for a special occasion or an outing where I feel like dressing up!!"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend on Saturday for their Winterlicious lunch menu and we both agreed that the food was delicious! Honestly, Licious menus can be so hit or miss that I'm always really impressed when a restaurant exceeds my expectations.

Appetizer:
My friend and I both ordered the goat cheese soufflé, since the lentil soup and harvest salad didn't seem that interesting. The soufflé was super fluffy and flavourful; the goat cheese taste was subtle (not pungent, as goat cheese often is) so I would still recommend this dish to people who aren't normally a fan of strong cheeses. Even the frisée salad was amazing - we cleared our plates in no time!

Main course:
I got the mushroom risotto while my friend ordered the beef bourguignon. I love risotto and this one did not disappoint - creamy and savoury with tender pieces of porcini mushroom. My friend enjoyed her food as well.

Dessert:
Both desserts were very good. I especially loved the paring of the salted caramel with the chocolate brownie cake (wish there had been more of that!), but the cake itself could have been more moist and probably would have tasted better served warm.

Overall, we had a lovely lunch and I thought the food was on par with the beautiful atmosphere. 

One thing to note: the lunch and dinner menus are almost exactly the same but dinner is $17 dollars more ($45 compared to $28), so lunch is definitely more worth it unless you're dying to try the duck confit."}
{"text":"I go to Colette about two times per week for their baked goods.

Their Croissants are excellent -- the best I've found in Toronto. I give them an 8/10 globally, and a 9.5/10 for North America. You can taste the butter and sugar in many of their delights. I've compared their baked goods to those created by Meilleurs Ouvriers de France (MOF) and they are right up there.

I heard they worked hard to source their butter.

Once I bought an 84% butter croissant from around the corner (Portland Variety). I had to take that croissant into Colette and show it to them, apologize, and have them throw the blasted thing out. There was no comparison. And the Colette croissant was cheaper.

I've had dinner there once. It was okay, but nothing mind-blowing. My recommendation is to focus on the excellent baked goods.

The service is slowly coming together.  Some team members are awesome (Pierre, Ariel) and others are sort of clue-less (rat-tail coffee guy). Since the place is new and I see some staff turn-over it seems they are slowly weeding out people and working on concentrating the talent. If they pull that off this place will be amazing.

One funny thing is I always order a Cafe Au Lait.  To me, this means brewed coffee with lots of milk added.  I've had about 10 different interpretations of a Cafe Au Lait though. Grin. For a while everyone was confused when I ordered it since there doesn't seem to be an accurate way to describe what I want. The nice thing about the Colette staff is now, after seeing me order it so often, they all seem to remember. The simple fact they they have a team which remembers your preferences makes it special to me. I go regularly to many other restaurants but I'm just a face in the crowd. Here there seems to be a nice team forming with lots of nice people.  It's still a new team, and has to work on the 'flow' more but that's my only criticism.

The place is managed by \"Chase\", which also manages some sea-food restaurants. It seems they got most things write with Colette:
  1) It is a beautiful BEAUTIFUL place to be. It's really gorgeous inside.
  2) The baked goods are generally phenomenal. I am yearning for them right now.
  3) Several staff members are EXCELLENT (although some are really clueless)

They are still a bit disorganized. It seems when you order what you ask for is sometimes diffused into a cloud of people and often you don't get exactly what you ordered. This needs to be worked on.  The 'flow' of the experience should be analyzed and improved.

Early on, when the restaurant opened, there were errors in what I ordered about 60% of the time. The thing is that Pierre recognized the errors and was super-duper gracious about fixing them. It never caused me any sort of grief, since the staff was so pleasant. They have a real asset with Pierre. You sort of expect it takes time for a new restaurant to get the 'flow' down.  But Colette is a little more challenged than most in this department due to the layout of the floor-plan.  People tend to criss/cross each other as they work through the queue.

If it improves in this area, and if they develop some winning dinner dishes this place could get to 5 star in a year."}
{"text":"Our company had our party here last Friday. 
The place was pretty and beautifully decorated. The food..... I'm not so sure.....

For starters, there was a seafood platter with smoked salmon, oyster, crab, and shrimp. Whatever radish or anything that was on the oysters was too strong. So i felt that it may not be that fresh. For the shrimp and crab, they were pretty tasteless. 

There was also some corn+edamame, mixed green, and quinoa salad. The butternut squash soup was my favorite.

For the main course was penne, mashed potato, chicken and beef. Seriously if they can't make good pasta they'll be pretty doomed. So.... The pasta was good. Same goes to the mashed potato. But the Chicken was dry and beef was bland, soaked in oil.....

As for dessert.... Since it's a French cafe, they didn't disappoint. The macaroon was sweet as usual..... But the little chocolate cake and tart were good. Later on we also had some yuzu cake (very refreshing), dark chocolate cake, ferrero Rocher cake and blackberry cake. I liked all of them ;)  

Overall it's fair. I'll probably come again but only for the dessert."}
{"text":"Dined here on a Friday night for a belated birthday celebration. They seated us at a romantic corner booth by the window as requested on our OpenTable reservation, woot! FYI - the restaurant only started to get busier around 8:45pm.

OVERALL: Loved it here but the two main dishes (shellfish pot and grilled striploin) missed the mark. If you've viewed my photos, I'm sure many are probably wondering the same thing... where can I buy those cute Eiffel Tower mini pans?!?! :o) The great service we received added an extra star to my review, and I absolutely loved the decor and ambience here. Would definitely recommend going to Colette for some fancy French fare minus all the pretension. I can't wait to try their Sunday Brunch!

~!~!~!~

FOOD/DRINK:

~ PROVENCAL SOUR: I didn't copy down the exact description unfortunately... It was a lemony cocktail with lavender bitters and egg white. It was the perfect cocktail for me - not too strong, but a good balance of hard liquor and fruity-lemony goodness. It was dressed up with a flower too.

~ BREAD BASKET: 3 types with apricot-peach butter. It was my first time tasting a fruit-infused butter; quite interesting and delicious. A very nice touch.

~ TRIO DE FOIE GRAS: foie gras three ways: torchon, parfait, and roti. Served with stone fruit and warmed house-made breads.
It was delicious! My favourite is always the seared (or \"torchon\") foie gras, although the fruit (peach?) was way too sweet and overpowered the foie gras, so I just ate them separately. The round foie gras had pistachio nuts surrounding it and a cookie base at the bottom - you must eat it all in one bite or else it will crumble in seconds. The foie gras parfait had some fruit infused in it and was a great spread on the mini flakey toasts. I would definitely order this again, hands down.

~ LA GRENOUILLE: crisped frog legs, braised and served with black garlic, mushrooms and pea puree.
Also pretty good - crispy little legs. I almost forgot I was eating frog... When I remembered, only THEN could I start to smell a bit of the frog in my mouth. Oh, how the mind plays tricks on me!

~ SHELLFISH MARINIERE: Chablis and dijon with garlic and herb pistou served with frites and aioli.
This main was just ok. The crab claws were very easy to eat because the chefs broke the shell pieces for you already. Despite giving us MORE bread, there was no soup base to dip it in. Probably won't order this again. 

~ ENTRECOTE AND FRITES: Grilled striploin with basil and chilli compound butter and tomato-horseradish concasse.
We asked for medium rare but it came closer to medium. The meat was still very tender, but it wasn't seasoned much and barely had any taste to it. The meat was also cool-warm, not hot (and no, it's not because I spent time taking a photo of it, smartass!) The basil butter was flavourful but cold, so it just made the whole dish even cooler to the touch and didn't really melt. The chilli part just tasted like salsa and I didn't feel like it needed to be there on the steak. Definitely won't order this again. 

NOTE: I also didn't feel like the main menu was very appealing. I would've much rather ordered a bunch of appetizers and desserts. I wish they had a more creative menu for the mains.

~ RIZ AU LAIT: toasted cinnamon rice pudding served chilled with sour cherry gelee, mascarpone and pistachios.
I was skeptical at first (because of the sour cherry gelee part) but it was delicious! 
The bottom layer is the rice pudding, then a layer of sour cherry jelly, then a whole lot of mascarpone cream and crushed pistachios at the top. All the flavours came together. Also, since it was my birthday, they added the nice touch of writing a birthday message on a macaron top. I would definitely order this again. 

NOTE #2: I wanted to order the Souffle for Two but it required another 20 minutes to wait for it to bake. I would've liked to know this earlier on in the dinner so I could've ordered it in advance. Boo. Next time! 

~!~!~!~

AMBIENCE: This place is gorgeous and feels like you're in a cute, quaint Parisian restaurant.  I think they also have an outdoor patio area that looks perfect for brunch, although I'm not sure if they've started using it yet. The music was off at times when they played house music. I don't think it should feel like a club... maybe if they stuck to French jazz/lounge tracks.

~!~!~!~

SERVICE: Excellent service. Our waiter was attentive, courteous and free of pretension. We also had 2 other waiters occasionally check up on us to make sure the food was good and our table was clean. We felt like we were being taken care of, but not in a pushy way."}
{"text":"The only thing I don't like about this place is that you pay extra and get no service. We went here for our 25th of December brunch and even though the food was great srbice and as lacking."}
{"text":"The Good:
Very friendly wait staff
Impeccable Decor - French Chic

The Bad:
Mediocre lunch buffet
1. soggy egg sandwiches 
2. dry roasted chicken
3. underwhelming lentil salad
4. cilantro based shrimp salad
5. undercooked quiche 
6. flavourless roasted vegetables

The crowd is very nouveau riche or wannabe 
The atmosphere is very pretentious 
The worse macaroons I have ever had. I had one bite of the pistachio macaroon and had to swallow it because it tasted like green tea matcha and they were all dry and stale. 
The tables are set tooooo close to each other. It feels very crammed with heavy chairs and lots of tables. 

In conclusions, I would not recommend this restaurant. Please save your money. Two people with just their lunch buffet, two bottles of sparkling, 2 coffees and macaroons cost $102 before tip."}

{"text":"Me and the hubby had the Sunday brunch just this past weekend on Valentine's day. We were lucky enough to get a reservation and what a pleasant surprise!

I'll start off with the good- we were seated within a few minutes of arriving for our 10am reservation. They took out coats, promptly brought the coffee, and directed us to the buffet. The food really is fantastic. We are both vegetarians but we do eat eggs and this buffet does not disappoint. Plenty of options, something for everyone and what a treat for the eyes! Photo ops everywhere, kind of funny to see everyone's so busy taking photos they hardly take the time to enjoy themselves.

Now the not so nice parts -although you give your table number at the egg station for omlettes /Benny's, the staff is seen going from table to table asking did you order this?? It was amusing at first but then it became annoying. We were interrupted over 5 times with someone else's eggs being brought over. Why? I have no idea.

Also closer to the end of the 2 hours brunch time slot, there were huge crowds huddled around the buffet. Taking pictures, blocking walkways to the washrooms. Really awkward. They have nowhere to stand and you have to excuse yourself 20 times to get a plate of food. Management needs to figure this out.. Other than that our day was great! We loved it! Pricing is steep but you do get what you pay for! Definitely a good brunch spot find."}
{"text":"Imagine you visited Paris and stepped inside an elegant Parisian cafe. This is Colette and so much more. I came here for the sunday brunch and I was not let down. It was gorgeous and beautiful and everything you could want in a French resto. The brunch selection was diverse but not very extensive. This allows for quality in the food over quantity. With that being side, my date really wished the dessert section had more variety. 

Service was beyond what I was expecting based on the reviews. If you come in as a normal nice person,  you will get good service. Come in a pompous rich snob and you will be treated as such. I loved the servers. They were all outstanding. Kind. Attentive and fast.

The other knock is the price. WOW. Dat price. Its way too much for brunch but for that special occasion or a chance to treat yourself, go for it.

I recommend the fried chicken. Hands down the best item there. The raisin salad with barley wheat was so good. I wasn't expecting it to be crunchy, sweet and savory. Great salad! All the desserts were on point. Some simple. But dessert is what you make of it. 

I would only come again if it was for something SPECIAL. 4 stars ****"}
{"text":"Needs to train their staff on service. Food came lukewarm...Sommelier and waitress couldn't pour wine without spilling some on the table... Asked for additional stuffed zucchini flower and were told it's not possible. Ordered a double espresso and a single was delivered. That's how they treat a seating of two that ordered a $300 bottle of wine and Champagne for cocktails... For a total bill of over $500 this was a deplorable experience!"}
{"text":"Tried the Winterlicious 2017 menu prix fixe at $48 per person. Food was alright to say the least but nothing super amazing. The interior seems fancy and there was a function going on as well. Had a nice waiter whom was attentive. 

[MEH] Baguette & sourdough bread: Hard and nothing too special. Served with two cute butter balls.

[YES, BABY YES!]Cured Lake Trout Salad (Buttermilk dill vinaigrette, radicchio and frisée salad, pistachio, trout caviar): The best and most delicious item on the menu. Sturgeon caviar was fresh and \"bouncy,\" can taste that it was not frozen. Not so much a vinaigrette, but more of a creamy dressing.

[MEH] Lamb Tagine Terrine (Carrot, cumin, coriander, preserved citrus): Friend like the taste of it, but he really did not like cold meat. 

[GOOD] BC Ling Cod (Savoy cabbage, confit apples, trumpet mushrooms, creamer potatoes, crème fraîche): Smelled quite fragrant and buttery. Was quite tasty with the mushroom and was cooked just right. The only thing was that it was a bit too salty, other than that it was not too bad.

[MEH] Braised Pork Cheeks (Coco beans, tomato passata, swiss chard, carrots, jus): Friend did not like the beans. He said meat was tender and juicy, but it did not suite his palate. 

[NOT BAD] Paris-Brest (Choux, hazelnut praline cream): Excellent hazelnut profiterole where the top is crunchy and the cream was not too sweet. Very good, especially with the candied nuts *drools*. 

[TOO SWEET] Camp Fire S'mores (Smoked marshmallow, graham crackers, chocolate ganache): This was too sweet, especially with the puddle of chocolate and marshmallow, but my friend like it more. 

Had a nice experience overall. Will I return? Maybe for brunch"}
{"text":"This review is strictly for the bakery/patisserie take-out experience. 

The cashier-server was being trained on that shift (that's fine!) she didn't really acknowledge me and finished chatting with the more senior staff while I'm waiting to order right in front of her. Maybe it's her first job, a bit slow with everything. 

Pastry-run for the family. Don't bother wasting your calorie quota on the cinnamon bun. Too dry, just sweet, not really flavours in it. Salted choco chip cookie - don't bother either. Rather have a chocolate chip from Portland Variety, Baked Shoppe, and Le Gourmand.

Cakes on the other hand were a delight. Be it raspberry, chocolate cake, white chocolate cheesecake, they were all good. Worth a try and a repeat! It's pretty too."}
{"text":"I wish I could say I loved this place, but I can't. A group of 7 of us came on a Sunday for brunch, and, consensus said it all - in short, beautiful venue, mediocre food. 

But, let me start with the positives. The venue itself is beautiful - it's like you pulled a Narnia and stepped out of the sub-zero temperatures of Toronto and into a bustling Parisian café. Gorgeous décor, large windows for natural lighting, and the little details make the atmosphere here top-quality.

But, the food. The eggs benny was soggy. The brunch buffet, while extravagant in looks, had food items that were, in majority, completely lacklustre in flavour. The varying food items in the chafing dishes that morning were lukewarm and lacked seasoning. In short, it wasn't delicious. It wasn't tasty. It didn't taste as good as it looks. The one food item I actually really enjoyed were the croissants - so light and buttery... but yes, apparently, we paid over $60.00 on brunch so we could munch on croissants. 

Yes, the place is pretty. But it's all glitz, no substance. It doesn't make up for the unremarkable food and the price that comes along with it. I wanted to love this place - but the food was really, really disappointing. 3 stars for atmosphere - but that's it."}
{"text":"Went here a couple months back for a friends birthday brunch. It was nice enough, decor is adorable and the seating area is spacious. 

My eggs benedict was fine, but they forgot the side salad. It was my first time there... I thought it was strange that nothing accompanied my eggs benedict but shrugged it off. However, I noticed other plates with salad/fruit as I was getting the bill, too bad. A place that charges $16 for eggs benedict really shouldn't forget the side. 

Service was good overall."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! First of all, the restaurant is beautiful and is such a great place to start off your day. I always come for the Saturday brunch, this place has great cappuccinos. I almost always get the smoothie bowl and it never disappoints. Also, their sausage is absolutely delicious so make sure you give that a try!"}
{"text":"You'd expect a restaurant owned by the Chase group (as in Chase fish and oyster) to nail ... you, know, fish. 

I think it's a case of style over substance. Sure they've spent a fortune on the decor - and that always makes me a bit nervous. I ordered the beef tartare and the halibut. The tartare was like raw beef ... and that's all. It was devoid of flavour. (Chantecler still rules in Toronto for tartare.)

And now the big disappointment: the halibut. It has so overcooked, it was completely dried out. Are you kidding me? Thank goodness for the creamy sauce below ... welcome moisture. 

My husband had the beef bourguignon and from the teeny tiny portion, he found it quite tasty, as was the bag of chips he devoured when we got home.

Sorry, but to me, food rules over million dollar decor. There are some great restaurants turning out amazing food in TO (for a lot less $$)."}
{"text":"Super stoked to come to Colette to celebrate a milestone with my partner, however our experience fell short from our expectations. 

When we first arrived, there were two people ahead of us in line.  The process for us to check into our reservation took about 10 minutes.  The whole check-in process felt very disorganized, but we thought it was just a one-off.

When we were seated at our table, we waited another 15 minutes for a server.  However, they never came.  Seeing that we had papers to request for omelettes and crepes, we ordered an omelette, left it on the table and explored the food selection.

We both really enjoyed the food. Charcuterie board, hot menu items, seafood (crab, oysters), and dessert were all very delicious.  After we came back and finished our first plate, a server still had not come by, but were attentive to the tables surrounding us.  

A few plates in, and a very scant amount of water left, our omelette still had not arrived.  Flustered with the poor service, we got our bill (which was very easy to get!).

For the amount we paid for Sunday brunch, we would have expected better service, however it was comparable to a Chinese buffet.  The only difference is that Chinese buffets constantly offer you water and the cost of the food is a fraction of what we paid at Colette's.  My rating definitely is not reflective of the good food, but for the poor service. 

If you end up in a similar situation as us, keep in mind that orange juice and coffee are included in the price.  We only found out after we had paid the bill."}
{"text":"Their seafood buffet was fresh, satisfying , & high in quality. It's a nice place for girls day/night out eating or family brunch."}
{"text":"I have never sat down here to eat, but have come often to pick up large amounts of baked goods and breakfast sandwiches to serve at office meetings.  

First, my only complaint:  It can be difficult to reach the bakery over the phone.  This is especially true if no one from Chase hospitality is there to transfer my call. 

HOWEVER, the friendly staff have been super helpful with providing me an email address (for when I need to pre-order a dozen sandwiches the night before a big morning meeting).  

The food is not only beautiful, but quite delicious.  I love that their breakfast sandwich (a large egg patty, cheese, bacon, arugula and garlic aioli mixed with homemade salsa verde on a massive sesame bun) is only $4. 

Every time I walk in, I dream about one day sitting down on their patio for some coffee and pastries !!!"}
{"text":"First off, I wanted to try this place because the restaurant interior looked very pretty and the menu selection looked great. Perfect for girls night out. 

We booked for Friday evening and when I arrived, I was greeted by a lovely host who took my jacket before I headed to the bar area to wait for my friends. They have a good selection of wine, a small selection available by the glass and a short list of cocktails available. The bartender recommended the Wanderlust to me so I gave it a try. A little too floral for my liking but very different. It would be boring if I just had a mojito or sangria here anyways. 

After my friends arrived, we were seated to our table. The dining room is surprisingly spacious and very pretty. The ambiance is nice and slightly dimmed. Part romantic, part stylish and chic. We ordered a bunch of items off the menu because we were famished and also we had trouble deciding. 

They started us off with basket of different breads served with pomello butter. The butter is like mixing regular butter and marmalade together except you get it i one go. Delicious.

Moved onto appetizers. We had fried frog legs and tuna tartar, both of which were nicely executed. The frog legs were just the right amount of crispy and tasted like fried chicken except it was kind of bland. 

Then we moved onto the mains. My friends got the seafood pot and the braised short rib with bone marrow which they both enjoyed. The size of the mains were well portioned (there's no tiny plates of expensive food here). I got the flank steak and I was very very impressed by how amazingly delicious it is. The higher option is the striploin but I always get striploin so wanted to try something new. I was expecting the flank steak to be tougher and dryer since it is the lower end option but I was so wrong. The flank was so tender, delicious and juicy! I ordered medium rare and it was just perfect. 

I had to leave early so didn't get to try the dessert menu but heard great things about it. My sister did end up buying a box of macarons in the bakery there and they were gigantic! Very elegantly placed in a nice box for her. Overall, great place to go for date night or with your besties."}
{"text":"Wonderful service, beautiful setting, small portions but quality of food was delicious. 

Prices are on the expensive side so I would come again for a special occasion. Would also like to try their Sunday brunch, but have been told it's a two-week wait list!"}
{"text":"***REVIEW OF SUNDAY BUFFET BRUNCH***

$54 per person

I have been for dinner at Colette and loved it--truly great experience in food and service. Brunch however, is another story.

I visited Colette for Sunday brunch with a friend on one of the first real patio seasons of the summer.  This was my first time brunching here and I believe it will be my last. The food was fine, but in my opinion, not worth the $54 per person buffet price. 

Upon check-in, the staff at the hostess stand were friendly and welcoming. We called a few minutes before our reservation to advise that we were running late and they were pleasant and understanding on the phone. 

Even though we were late, we had a bit on a wait as they were quite busy--no big deal. We weren't in a rush. 

Once seated, out server promptly greeted our table. He asked if we had been there for brunch before. We said, \"no\" and so he described what was included. What he didn't tell us, was the location of the buffet, nor how to get to it.

The set-up for those of us on the patio is very poorly designed.  There are planters bordering the patio with about 12\" of space between them. There is no clear access point to/from the patio. So, to get to the buffet, one has to manoeuvre through the small gap.  Anyone who is larger may have trouble. 

Once you wiggle your way off the patio (I'm exaggerating here a bit), you must re-enter the restaurant, past the hostess stand and bump-and-\"excuse me\" your way through the line-up and collection of people waiting for tables or for the rest of their group to arrive. This is especially annoying when you're returning back to your table with a full plate. 

The buffet itself is set-up along the bar and just adjacent to it. There is a \"hot\" (read: \"warm\") station with roast beef, waffles, fried chicken, pancakes and French toast, peach crumble, sausage and bacon. They also provide an array of toppings like fruit compote, Nutella, cream cheese (I think), peanut butter, etc.

The cold station included small sandwiches, arugula, quiche, mussels, smoked salmon, shrimp, meats and cheeses, grilled vegetables like peppers, eggplant and asparagus, steamed (served cold) vegetables like broccoli and cauliflower (with Moroccan flavour), pasta salad and couscous salad, Caprese (tomato slices with bocconcini) and cucumber salad. 

The dessert items included, (a bland) tiramisu, chocolate trifle, citrus trifle with a meringue topping, brownies, tarts, mini cupcakes, cake pops, yogurt and granola and fruit.

My first impression if the buffet was negative--there was a dirty, sloppy plate near the end and in front of the stack of clean plates. It was right near where there were a few staff members standing and I never saw the plate moved though it appears to have been in clear view of the employees. 

I would have expected the serving utensils to have been replaced more regularly as they were a little dirty from (understandably) constant use.  

I didn't notice any savoury breads or crostini, etc. which I would have liked with my salmon and I'm sure it would have been good with the mussels.

Carving station service was polite. Table service was fine. Our server was pleasant and he and the support staff always made sure our plates were cleared and we had new, clean cutlery.  It was odd that after our meal, and declining any more beverages, our bill never came. I had to ask for it about 45 minutes after we finished. Like I said, we weren't in a rush.

Brunch for 2, including two cocktails ($9 and $10 each) plus tax and 18% tip came to $166.

In my opinion, this brunch is severely overpriced but people don't seem to notice or care because the place was busy the entire time we were there. Nothing was \"amazing.\" Everything was just OK. I would probably give the brunch a 2.5/5 stars, but I can't and just 2 seemed a little harsh. 

My advice, skip brunch and come here for dinner. There are plenty of fantastic brunch places in the city. For $166 you could get a great brunch and an afternoon of beers elsewhere."}
{"text":"I love visiting Colette Cafe not just for their delicious teas and caffinated beverages but also to admire their beautiful interior design and decor. For those who know me, my absolute favourite colour is blue. They just make everything look so elegant and precious. I'm literally obsessed with every detail they have from tiles, paint, furniture and fixtures. It's very European, which they are, and I absolutely adore. 

I never really had the chance to pick out anything other than their hot beverages and a buttered almond croissant here and there, but they most certainly offer items such as baguettes, cupcakes, special donuts, cake, macarons, quiches and salads. Honestly I get so focused and fixated on their restaurant designs that I lose focus on the actual menu itself. I'm don't have much of a sweet tooth so I'm not necessarily drawn to the sweet items like most of my friends do. Other than that, if you enjoy tea they have a wide selection of aromatic teas to choose from. Colette also has a really great patio which is open during the warmer months. It is located on a smaller street in Toronto so if you like a more quiet, outdoor environment to do work you may want to check this place out."}
{"text":"Saturday brunch was a crowd in a beautiful interior. A modern European feel. We enjoyed taking pictures by the banquettes. 

The tartare was great, but the waffle cut potato chips were too thin to be a vehicle for the tartare. It had a great seasoning, and the egg was a nice textural addition. 

I appreciate fig in fruit platters!

I would have enjoyed it more had it not taken so long to either get our dishes or our bill, no matter how many times we asked for it. The service was okay throughout, but when you're on a tight schedule, it can be a pain. Would have loved to head in for Sunday brunch instead! That'll be a future trip."}
{"text":"I didn't feel it met the expectations of the fine brunch or dining, but to be honest it wasn't that bad. In design of Colette was beautiful and elegant but the food I'd say perhaps nothing to rave about. I'd come again just for the feel of the place and for coffee (: better place to be with friends."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for Sunday brunch. I made reservations a week in advance and there was only a 10 am spot left (which was perfect for me).

The first thing I noticed about the restaurant was the atmosphere. It was so bright, sunny and cheerful. I love the blue and white colours they used at the front of the restaurant.

The server told us that grapefruit juice, orange juice, coffee and tea were all included in the brunch price ($54). I didn't really like the grapefruit juice because it wasn't sweet enough. The orange juice tasted really good and I swear it tasted kind of like pineapple juice.

The presentation of the spread was gorgeous. I usually don't take pictures of buffets but it was too pretty not to. I wouldn't say that there was a lot of options. However, everything they have to offer is delicious and right up my alley. In other words, they gave us quality over quantity. 

My only complaint is their dessert. I felt like there weren't that many options and nothing really stood out.

I can't wait to treat myself for brunch here sometime soon!"}
{"text":"As someone who travels often for work, finding the 'best of's' in each city is my way of enjoying the tedious monontony of constantly being in and out of airports, hotels and cabs. Although pastries aren't typically my first option of food choices, a 6AM spin class paired with a colleague with a sweet tooth lead me to the doors of Colette Grand Cafe at 7:30AM on a Monday morning. 

Although the hours listed begins at 7AM, we walked into an empty restaurant with staff just starting to put things into place. The decor was beautiful and I really wish I had more time to sit and enjoy  but that's what next times are for! In any case, when we finally had the attention of a server, we found that only certain types of croissants were available and others were still in the oven on its way. As disappointed as I was that a regular croissant was not ready (you'd think these would be the first finished), I chose the next  best option, an almond croissant. I'm not a huge sweets person so i was pretty apprehensive about the almond croissant but WOW, I can say this is probably the best almond croissant I have ever had. With bits of sticky crunch from the glaze followed by an absolutely perfect balance of flake and butter, this pastry sat on the perfect line of being decadent but not overly so. The almond custard within was also light and refreshing without being too sweet. The crunch of glaze paired with the buttery pastry, light custard and softly sweet dusting of icing sugar was absolute heaven. We never shared, but my colleague said her chocolate croissant was also to die for. 

Since I was only able to enjoy the croissant and nothing else, my review is based on what I have with one star docked for items not being available despite restaurant opening time. I would definitely go back to check out other items and cannot wait to sample the plain croissant."}
{"text":"Very poor service. Came here on Valentine's Day evening. We had been excited to get even a late evening seating. Waiter took our order but came back 15 minutes later to confirm our selections - he hadn't entered our choices. Dissapointing and unprofessional. 

For main courses,  The beef shortrib had good texture. I could appreciate what the plate was trying to achieve,  but it was overwhelmed by heavy-handed salt.  The same for the pasta plate.  

The highlight of the evening was the goat cheese souffle.  I would have never imagined it to taste so heavenly.  They live up to their name as a bakery.  Their dessert was also delicious! Hostess was courteous and friendly.  

In the end, neutral feelings.  Memorable for the wrong reasons.  I will return for their brunch. Maybe I will have a better impression. Will update this review then."}
{"text":"Came here for Easter Brunch - while the food was good, the price tag surely isn't justified ($75/person, not including tax, tip or drinks). The selection of food was pretty solid - crepes, omelettes, chicken/waffles, seafood and plenty more however again, nothing that blew my mind for that price tag. Also, the crab legs were not available while I was there - something my family had been looking forward too! Definitely a let down.

With that being said, the restaurant itself is beautiful and perhaps we just had an off day. May be worth trying for dinner instead!"}
{"text":"My beau spoiled me over the weekend and took me here for a belated birthday brunch and I enjoyed every minute of it there!

The place is beautiful, ambiance was wonderful, nice plush chairs, excellent service and the food was delish!

If you haven't gone what are you waiting for?!! Make your reservations for a Sunday and give it a try. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"So delicious!! Buffet for lunch with unshelled crab. Seafoods. French toast. Poached eggs. Fresh fruits. Stuffed gdness. Puddings. etc.  Variety was intense fresh and delicious. Wish to come here more often. Though it is pricey"}
{"text":"Went there with my friend. 

Ordered veal tartare and hamachi for appetizer. 

The veal tartare was 2 out of 10. 
And I'm a big beef tartare fan and have tried it at most established french restaurants in Toronto. 

Hamachi was just ok. 

We both ordered sirloin entrecôte steak. 

Both steaks 3 out of 10 and I'm being really generous here since the frite was good. 

She couldn't even finish half her steak. 

Ordered chocolate soufflé for desert which was really good. 

For the price you're paying this place is FAR from impressive. 


3.5 for food. 

9.0 for service 

9.0 for decor. 


As a real estate broker I get to dine at many nice restaurants and I must say I won't be going back to Colette!!!"}
{"text":"First brunch spot I love that's not for their eggs benny, says a lot! Brunch is never brunch without eggs benny for me, but the variety of food at Colette made up for it.

It's an AYCE brunch restaurant that only serves brunch during weekends. The inside of the place is cozy, reminds me of how the inside of a mansion would look like. The decor is so lovely and detailed. I find most brunch places to be a bit too loud - not great for the morning especially before I have my coffee. Atmosphere at Colette is light and peaceful. They serve hot dishes, cold dishes, seafood, carbs, protien, and pastries, you can't look for anything more than what this place has to offer.

Our server is one of a kind, another great thing about Colette. He refills coffee, water, juice whenever our glasses are almost empty. He explains everything, asks questions, and always responds with \"Oui\". 

The best part about Colette? If you sit by the windown, you have an AMAZING view of the park across the street, where a lot of people take their dogs to!!"}
{"text":"Being able to make reservations is a huge win in my books, especially for Sunday brunches. For whatever reason, toronto seems to lack restaurants that allows a reservation system. Very welcoming greeting followed by very informative instructions on how to go about the all you can eat brunch. 

Great selection of foods, all disappearing quickly and replenished as quick as it goes! Highlight for me has to be the oysters and the eggs Benedict, but that doesn't mean the rest were bad. Could not find any food that tasted bad. Servers were on point with the removal of the plates and constant replenishing of cutlery and water. Very impressed with the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Saturday brunch review. The ambiance is better than the food itself. The main dining area, the outside patio... it was all very inviting and elegant. They played Common - Be during my entire meal at a very low volume level. I Didn't realize that this album could be made into elegant restaurant music. 

The food itself was decent, but nothing special. I had the french toast and paid $8 for the foie supplement, only to find out that the foie was the size of a twoonie. Wasn't worth it at all. 

The croissant was very good and came out slightly warm. I would come back just for the baked goods. 

Aside from my $8 foie addition, all the brunch items were fairly priced and well worth it compared to what you would get a Thompson diner next door or anywhere else within walking distance. 

Overall, good vibes but decent/average food."}
{"text":"Came for Sunday brunch.  The food that they have is good quality.  The issue is the small selection compared to other places and there seemed to be a lot of empty serving platters and there was no attempt to keep the food restocked.  The cost is $54 per person and the value for the cost is just not there.  Then, add $20 for parking and the cost becomes ridiculous for the choices available.  We have been to comparable costing buffets in South Florida where for the same price the parking is free, there about twice the food options and the champagne is included in the price."}
{"text":"Cool decor, very slow and sloppy service for fine dining. Salad bar looks stale, no table bread. Water frequently empty. Food served slightly cold. Burger Bun was wet and saugy tasting. Creol chicken had minimal very waters down flavour. Frites were good but aioli was also watered down. Not filling."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant with nice servers, went for a sunday brunch to celebrate my birthday, the cake and handwritten card was a nice touch, it is a little pricey but overall a positive experience. Omelette was perfectly done, bread and croissant are alright but I had better."}
{"text":"came here for sunday brunch with my bf for his bday and considering the amount of bad reviews on yelp.. i was pretty on the fence about coming here but i still wanted to try it nonetheless.. despite the amount of reviews here that say the service sucks, the service we received was perfect! we were late for our reservation so they had to reasonably give away our table for the next reservation but we were seated quickly within the next ten minutes by a friendly, smiley hostess. our waitress immediately offered us drinks. now to the food, i didn't really care that much about the selection of food except i really wanted lobster and crab lol unfortunately, at first glance, there was no crab or lobster, just shrimp and smoked salmon.. was pretty devastated... BUT! heres the game changer,  i noticed a coleslaw type salad sitting lonely beside the platter of smoked salmon untouched but didn't think too much of it. to my pleasant surprise, upon closer look, it was a LOBSTER salad!! they weren't cheap on the lobster either, it was PACKEDDDDD! that made my day lol nothing feels better than lost and found haha i dont think a lot of people knew it was a lobster salad and i'm guessing they probably put it more to the back deliberately so people wouldn't go HAM on it :P subsequently, we asked our waitress about the crab because we thought maybe that's hidden somewhere as well, too bad they actually didn't have any because apparently there was something wrong with the crab supply? overall, i had a good experience here, my bf loved the food (he ate like 7 plates), ambiance, decor and service. will definitely be back for the on the menu desserts!"}
{"text":"A trip to France! A quaint little spot where you can enjoy any meal of the day or even just go for a drink! Their classic breakfast is delicious! Over easy eggs with peppered bacon and their home fries so good! I've also been on a separate occasion for lunch and I had the roast chicken. Very good food! My most recent venture was for a bachelorette where service was amazing and they even included a little dessert platter which was to die for! (Photo attached). You can never go wrong coming here! Love the staff and love the food"}
{"text":"I came here with high hopes from reading reviews and was utterly disappointed.

We were a large party of around 12 and had a reservation at 2:30 pm for their weekend brunch. Our table wasn't ready until 2:50 or so.. Which I was still fine with at the time.  I honestly was not that impressed with the food offered to be worth my money. There weren't any lobsters, and the crab claws were sparse and they stopped filling them half way through our brunch. They didn't refill the crepes either, which sucked, but I can understand since it was later in the day.. But if there is still time before last call.. i would expect there to still be food, especially for the premium I am paying. 

There wasn't that much food as I expected. There were fruits.. Salad.. Apple crumble, pasta of sorts, sirloin, cheese, prosciutto, shrimp, crab claws, variety of desserts and pastries, quiches, and an omelette station.

Service wasn't particularly great either. Idk if it's cause we were a large party but it shouldnt be an excuse. We often had to ask for cutlery after our previous ones got taken away after eating a dish.. And had to sit there for a good 5 minutes just waiting. Only from reading yelp reviews did I know that juice and smoothies are complimentary and part of the brunch price. The servers mentioned nothing of the sort.

What the worst part was the bill... It ended up being $75 per person BEFORE tax, which our party realized after leaving the restaurant. So when we called to enquire why that was, the staff answered that they must have accidentally charged us Easter weekend pricing (we went the weekend before Easter), and said they would refund us the excess of the original $55 pp before tax. But the next day, they called us to clarify that the staff actually did not make a mistake, and because we were a large party, the pricing is actually $75 per person. And after taxes and the required 20% gratuity, it totals to be $100 pp.. Even though we get the SAME amount of food as a small party. #donotcomprehend So now I can say it's definitely not worth my money.

The only good thing I can say about this place is the decor.  SIGH.

Honestly, just save yourself the money and don't do the buffet brunch. Not sure I'd come back to try their regular menu either now..."}
{"text":"Monday lunch with the girlfriends. I really enjoyed the atmosphere of this place. Everyone was so pleasant and accommodating. 

I originally had intentions of coming in and having the salad buffet, however when I had got there I took a look at it and as some of the items looks delicious others just looked like it had been sitting there for a while. So I opted for the Creole Chicken Club which I definitely was not disappointed. I ordered the chicken club with a side of their frites instead of salad (clearly I was not going healthy this day). Presentation was beautiful and the flavours were amazing. The downfall? It seemed like the bread didnt evenly bake which left a space in between the crust and the middle, thus making it rather difficult to consume the sandwich. It was extremely messy, however definitely worth having it all over my face =)

I think I would come back on a Sunday for brunch with my mother so she can give it a try. Thank you for the amazing hospitality, I will see you soon!!"}
{"text":"Underwhelming. The best part about this cafe is the atmosphere. It's unfortunate that the food was very much sub par. Bland and under seasoned, it did not resemble the depth of flavors in simplest form quintessential to French cuisine, even cafe fare. My friends ordered from the summerlicious menu: the shrimp Louie ( shrimp, mayo, over an iceberg slice), pacific humboldt squid (flavor was completely lacking, waste of a beautiful squid steak) and the highlight of their order the summer berry pavlova (absolutely perfect). I ordered the pea croquettes, which actually were delightfully tasty. The natural flavor of the pea really came through but it was slightly dry, required more sauce to really be a stellar dish. I also ordered the moules frites. I didn't think anyone could mess up moules frites, but alas, Colette grand cafe has. The mussels were so fresh and plump but the sauce base was watery and bland. Perhaps they forgot the creme fraiche this day because the wine was overpowering in an undercooked, hasn't simmered long enough way. Overall, this cafe seems to be known for Sunday brunch and pretty beverages, of which the cucumber raspberry twist was both aesthetically pleasing and tasty. If you're looking for the perfect instagram photo, then this place, though lacking flavor, will suffice. Otherwise, beyond Sunday brunch, it is very over rated and over priced."}

Had a romantic dinner here with the wife on a Sunday evening.

First impressions: romantic, classy decor with dim lighting that sets the appropriate ambience. The setting is quite picturesque.

Our server explained the menu and provided helpful suggestions. Service was timely, helpful, and professional.

Apps:
Foie Gras: done three ways. Approximately 35 dollars. The seared foie was by far the best. Of course that also boils down to preference. Foie lovers should all find something to enjoy here.
Goat cheese soufflé: tasty and accompanied by beets, nuts, and presented like a salad. 

Entrees:
Halibut: flaky, tasty, and par for the course. Not remarkable but enjoyable for seafood lovers and fans of halibut
Tenderloin: served with fries. Juicy, tender, and flavourful. Not sure if it's dry aged but for the price not a bad steak and a tasty entree.


Bottom line: A picturesque setting with excellent service and prices in keeping with a fairly high quality food standard. Can certainly see myself returning."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner tonight to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Regretfully, I didn't get our server's name, but he was very polite and offered great service. All the wait staff were great actually. Most, if not all, had a French accent. The ambiance is absolutely beautiful and relaxing. Unfortunately, we could not boast as much about the food. Nothing was wrong with it. In fact, all was good, but not the best we've had. For appetizers, we ordered the French onion soup and mushroom tartine (toasted bread with mushrooms in cream sauce on top). Mains were duck l'orange and steak frites. We really enjoyed our appetizers. In fact, the soup was one of the best we've had. Mains were a little disappointing as they were overly salty. I did appreciate the server asking if my steak was done right though. The desserts did not appeal to us. We also really enjoyed our drinks - my husband had a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon and I had a Virginia kicking mule. Both were great pairings with our food. I would probably come back if I was invited by friends, but would not initiate the return. One star was deducted for the salty food."}
{"text":"Nice place with nice decor and good food.  The Sunday brunch has great selection - Benedict's, mini pastry sandwiches, salmon Wellington's and much much more.  The ambience is upscale with lots of natural lighting because of the large window walls.  

It's a great place to take your partner for a food and social experience."}
{"text":"The service was really good and our waiter parle français :) The decor of the restaurant and the presentation of the food were both on point as always. However the food, this time the Sunday brunch, was also, as always, sub par. One previous time, the duck confit was too salty to eat and this time the freshly squeezed juice had shaved ice in it, like a slushy... The entire buffet had nothing creative  or super memorable except the price tag of $300 in total for 4 people without alcohol."}
{"text":"Came on a Monday lunch time. Slow but polite service. Ordered the omelette that came w salad & toast. Did not offer jam or butter for the toast. Salad had large leaves that you had to cut yourself. Omelette was horrible. Oily, too salty, cheese & asparagus weren't spread throughout. Would literally never come here again. Go to anywhere else for a fluffier and bigger omelette."}
{"text":"The Sunday dinner buffet is an excellent value if you are hungry. Rack of lamb, lobster, shrimp, roast, pasta to order, salads, good fried chicken. and tasty desserts. If you take your time what they bring out keeps changing."}
{"text":"$40 for Sunday feast. Salmon Wellington, lobsters, pea pasta (?) and tons of good quality food for buffet. One of the best restaurants I have been in Toronto. Will definitely come again, possibly during the summer, for croissants, macarons and the patio!"}
{"text":"Went here for Easter Sunday brunch. Price tag was a hefty $75/person. Not haven't been here before, I can't say how the Easter buffet differed from the regular Sunday brunch.
 
Good variety at the seafood station. The shrimp especially was very fresh. A couple of stand-outs from the vegetarian section were the falafel salad and the eggplant.
 
The hot food station had lamb roast, salmon quiche and the usual sausage/bacon/French toast offerings + eggs benny. My favorite was the fried chicken
bites.
 
No better way to finish than with one of their amazing crepes. Unlike at other places that make crepes really heavy and loaded up, their crepe was light but packed with flavor. Highlight!
 
Dessert could have used more assistance. the crème Brule stood out but the cakes fell flat. I would just get more crepe instead."}
{"text":"Beautiful venue both inside and outside. This is an instagrammers dream location- tons of photo oops. Staff was super friendly and the overall venue is great for large parties.

They have a restaurant area and a bakery area. Let's start with their bakery... Um... Tons of baked goods, including decadent macarons (best I've had in awhile). And great coffee and tea choices. They even have chocolate tea!!!!

The restaurant is beyond amazing. I definitely had a Parisian moment. And the food is delicious!!! I had the Colette burger and fries- yes, I finished my whole plate. And of course, I saved room for dessert... Yum yum!!! Definitely going back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"MAKE SURE YOU MAKE A RESERVATION! They prioritize those with reservations, and it fills up incredibly fast. Colette's is a one of a kind experience, the food is incredible, literally anything on that menu will taste full of flavour and aroma. In the mornings they come around with a cart and offer grapefruit mimosas and the original orange juice mimosas. The staff is very accommodating and friendly, I love coming here for breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"Beautiful place. Went on a Tuesday night and had an enjoyable evening. Food was delicious. Little pricey but portions are generous so it is worth it. Complaint was with the service. Only about 50% full but everything seemed to take a long time. Usually dont mind waiting for food but having to wait with empty glasses annoys me. Also had to wait almost 20 minutes just for our bill."}
{"text":"This place is fabulous.  One of my go to dinner spots on King west.  The service is always impeccable, the food divine.  The decor is a treat in and of itself but the restaurant is so much more.  No idea what all these other reviews are speaking about.  Yes, it's not a pub.  Don't come dressed for the pub after a blue jays game.  Some people appreciate a place where you can dress decently for dinner.  Hands down the best mussels in the city.  I have taken friends many times and everyone agrees it's fantastic."}
{"text":"Decent French cafe.  I enjoyed all the appetizers we tried.  In particular, the mushroom tartine on sourdough was delicious; I was expecting crostini but the bread was soft and soaked in the sauce.  The cheese twists were also great and served fresh and warm.  The pea croquettes were decent and what I would expect out of a pea croquette, and I also liked the chopped salad, although one person in our party found the dressing too tart.

I went for a lighter entree and got the smoked salmon, which is pretty hard to mess up but also hard to differentiate.  Others in our party seemed to enjoy the seafood (moules frites, trout, halibut) but were less enthused about the duck.  

Dessert options are limited to slices of cake, and we tried the opera cake and another chocolate cake with raspberry coulis.  Not bad, but really nothing outstanding or memorable either.  I probably would skip the dessert and go elsewhere for sweets."}
{"text":"I only purchased a appetizer here so my review might have some bias. I had the beef tartare which was nice and was a bit spicier than I had expected. However not the best beef tartare I've had in Toronto. The restaurant is cute inside trying to mimic France however it feels like it's missing something- they didn't quite nail the French vibe. Our server had a French accent which was a nice touch although she was most likely from Quebec. Not a very busy restaurant though so the atmosphere here is just okay. I'd like to come back to try the brunch some day but dinner I would skip to be honest, the menu wasn't very enticing."}
{"text":"Fantastic French café with a wide range of choices.  Love the patio looking into the park. 
Best local people watching spot....  And down at the Wellington or on king street for the masses."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been wanting to try Sunday brunch at this place for a while now and we were so sad that we couldn't get any reservations for Valentine's Day. We were finally able to get a reservation this past weekend and it was like love at first sight the moment we walked into this restaurant. From the pretty decor, to the variety of foods and desserts offered at the brunch buffet, we were beyond excited to start eating. Although the price is quite high ($54 per person which also includes drinks (coffee, tea, orange and cranberry juice)) I personally think that it's very reasonable for their good service and high quality foods. 

Service and Environment:
I felt like I was in French restaurant and the Eiffel tower (instead of the CN tower) was minutes away from me haha. We received good service from our waiter who was always making sure we were doing alright and would always take away our plates and gave us a new set of cutlery while we were grabbing more food. The servers at the egg/roast beef/hot foods station was also very kind. I'd say there was a bit of a wait time for our eggs (as you order them first at the egg station and they will bring it to your table for you), around 10-15 minutes which wasn't too bad when you're occupied by other delicious foods. 

Food:

Savoury
Honestly, there was not one dish that I tried that I did not like. Some of my personal favourites:
- Chicken and Waffles: YOU need to try this. Chicken was extra crispy and seasoned well and the waffles were fluffy and semi sweet.
- Salmon Wellington: My first time having this dish and it was really really good.
- French Toast and Pancakes: Both were really fluffy. 
- Roast Beef: It was very juicy however they did not provide any gravy with this which was a bit saddening. 
- Eggs: You can customize your eggs any way you like - omelette style, sunny side up..etc. We ordered an omelette and it tasted very creamy and light. Loved it. 

Sweet
There were so many available that I did not have the stomach to try them all. Again my personal favourites:
- Creme Brûlée 
- Chocolate mousse in a dark chocolate bowl
- Macarons
- Peach cobbler
- Orange deconstructed cake in a cup"}
{"text":"I came here Saturday early afternoon for brunch. This place really cute, really nice decor and definitely a good spot to hang out with the girls. We made reservations and had requested for a preferred seat in the patio, but didn't get it because they didn't have enough staff to open it up. That was a little disappointing. 
The service was very friendly, but quite slow. We waited a long time for our food. But to make up for it we received complimentary croissants. The chocolate almond croissant was amazing. 
I had ordered the smoked salmon Benedict, it was good but nothing amazing. I guess I expected more from Colette. I had also expected the presentation of the food to look better.  My friends ordered the omelette of the day which had lobster it in. It was literally like an egg burrito. Always thought omelettes had the ingredients mixed in with the egg before it is cooked, not just placed in side of it like a burrito/taco. 
Anyways, will come back to try more treats from the bakery but no more brunch."}
{"text":"a very pretty resto. we had the breakfast brunch. unfortunately they told me this would be discontinued soon. yogurt fruit cups, sliced melon, pastries, nutty tasting oatmeal, OJ , and coffee. $10.99. delicious."}
{"text":"Venue/Atmosphere - 5 stars
Service - 3 stars
Food - 4 stars
Value - 3 stars 

I came here for a weekend brunch buffet, and it was quite busy. We made reservations and still had to wait about 10 mins to get seated. For a buffet, the quality of the food is better than your typical buffet, but at the premium that you pay ($50-60), I'm not sure that it was worth it. I can only eat so much, so I definitely don't feel like I got my $$$'s worth. The venue and decor is really nice, so it's an experience. I'm not sure that it was worthy to be classed as a Parisian experience, but nonetheless, the place is nice for a girls day out. The service I didn't care for; our waiter rarely came to clear the empty plates off our table nor to refill our beverages. I can see myself coming back, but maybe only for a special occasion."}
{"text":"When it comes to décor, Colette Grand Café is just... grand.  Very Parisian with the only complain is that they're playing ambient music which in many ways ruined the Parisienne feel of the restaurant.

Food price is more than decent with very good quality ingredients and presentation.  Unfortunately all of the food I ordered (including the desserts) are too salty for my taste.  How is a Dark Chocolate Macaron be salty?  That's just plain wrong.  The fried frog legs are extremely tasty but at $21 for four legs it's plain insane.  I expect \"expensive\" but I didn't expect \"insanely expensive\".

As for service, everybody was extremely friendly and knowledgeable but having four different staff asking \"how's the food\" is a tad much for my taste.

Would I go back?  For certain items such as the Sunday's Special pork dish (at $20) yes.  For the $21 frog leg appetizer or the $58 seafood appetizer, definitely not."}
{"text":"We came here for our one year wedding anniversary. The food was excellent - we ordered the crab cakes to start. They were possibly the best crab cakes we've ever had, and were sitting in a delicious seafood broth. I ordered the seafood bouillabase - huge portion full of seafood and came with garlic bread. My husband ordered the duck confit.
The service was good but a bit slow. When we asked for the bill, we saw that our server spent more than 10 minutes setting up an empty table (when there were many other empty tables around) - I'm sure this was not priority compared to getting our bill. We were getting a bit antsy after sitting for 3 hours. 
I was also a bit disappointed because I had called the restaurant ahead of time to let them know that we were celebrating our one year anniversary. To my disappointment, they were not able to organize any special dessert for us. They did not even acknowledge it was our anniversary when we arrived. Not even a dessert that had Happy Anniversary written on it. I know that if we had gone to another restaurant, we would have had more special treatment. Maybe it's because so many other people come here for special occasions, but we expected more from Colette. Especially since I had called ahead."}
{"text":"This place is definitely all aesthetics. The beautiful interior draws you in and the service is exceptional - both of which are good distractions to the okay food. I came here for an event and had the eggs benedict with a latte. The eggs benny was slightly undercooked and topped off with a bland hollandaise sauce. The latte was pretty good and something I'd come back for if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Such a special spot! It's expensive but the food is amazing ! The brunch is to die for."}
{"text":"Came here late at night for coffee and dessert and it was on point. Sat at the bar. It's a really nice bar. The Italian marble and other decorations help make this place stand out. 

The coffee was great and fresh. Our server brought out a dessert tray. I pretty much wanted everything.  Settled on the raspberry cake. Delicioul, layered and beautiful.

They also serve alcohol till late at the bar. Dinner finishes up a lot earlier. About 45 mins before they close. Loved the house music as I warmed up drinking my coffee.  

I can't say anything about the food of dinner but would consider giving it a shot."}
{"text":"So we showed up at Collette Grand Cafe expecting to sample their Winterlicious menu, but as soon as we sat down, we were presented with the restaurant's usual Brunch menu. And because said menu contained French Onion Soup, which I have to order whenever I see it, the plans immediately changed.

Obviously I started with the French Onion Soup (\"Sherry, Crouton, Gruyere\"), and honestly, this was one of the worst versions of this dish I've eaten in a very long time. There were so many problems I'm not even sure where to begin. First and foremost, the cheese was placed *inside* the soup, which prevented that delectable, irresistible crust of cheese from forming atop the bowl. Equally problematic was the broth itself, which was far too thin and watery. One of the best things about French Onion Soup, aside from the cheese, are the rich, caramelized onions contained within and the deep flavors they infuse into the broth. These onions weren't caramelized, so that depth of flavor was completely absent. I ate the whole thing, but I can't say I enjoyed it.

For my main, I went with the Buttermilk Pancakes (\"Blueberry Compote, Chantilly Cream, Ontario Maple Syrup\"). And indeed, they were a monumental improvement over the soup. The pancakes were soft and fluffy (although a little thinner than I might've preferred), and the blueberry compote and chantilly cream were a perfect accompaniment. But, and this is a big but, the pancakes arrived to the table room temperature. They'd clearly been sitting out while my dining companion's food was being prepared and the dish severely suffered because of this. Taste and flavor mean nothing if your food is being delivered long after it's been prepared.

I think it's safe to say that Collette Grand Cafe's success is due mostly to the ambiance, as the place does indeed resemble a French restaurant. Shame about the food, though."}
{"text":"Colette is very well decorated with a great ambiance. Their service was amazing when it came to the support staff who were clearing the plates, and filling up water glasses. But the actual server himself seemed uninterested near the end of our meal. In the beginning he was on point with our coffee and mimosas, but it took at least 30 minutes until we could wave him down for our cheque. 

The food was okay. I didn't feel blown away or overly impressed. The options were very interesting and they seem to have put some thought into it. But the actually execution was lacking. Not one thing I tasted left any impression. 

At the end of everything with tax and tip I walked away spending $90 for myself. This included the buffet, a coffee, and a mimosa. That is ridiculous! The food was not worth the price I paid. This is definitely a spot for people with cash to burn and care more about their status than the quality that they're paying for. 

If you have that much money and looking for something good to eat, go one block East and check out Le Select Bistro."}
{"text":"This is may not be my best place to go but it is better than most of places which is in same category.I went there for a brunch and I was satisfied except wash rooms area.They have to check more..Food are over standard,service was excellent."}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday afternoon for brunch with a party of 14. We had reservations for 2:30pm but ended being seated at 3pm. Since we chose the AYCE, we were quite hungry by that time and could not understand why it took so long to be seated even though we had reservations. 

The food options are quite diverse however it ran out quite quickly at that time and was not refilled. The quality is high but the food tasted quite average for the price we paid. I did not find the food to be any different than other brunch places. 

The place had a custom omelette/eggs Benedict stand which had a unique twist. The servers were well dressed and the diner had a classy feel. 

With a large group, we ended up paying a group premium with tax and tip. This hurt the wallet quite a bit without the benefits of a high class food."}
{"text":"I just came for the Sunday brunch this past weekend - probably my 5th time since it opened. It's still a great experience and the food is still quite good BUT I have noticed a lot of cutbacks that have affected the food quality - namely the switch from amazing freshly squeezed juices to Tropicana tasting generic OJ. At $60/head I think it's lame and the waiter still said would you like \"fresh juice\". Another quality cut is the loss of the mushroom duxelle in the salmon wellington - wild rice is a pale comparison - more filler than flavor. I also noticed they no longer offered the amazing creme frêche with the salmon and they have cut back to just one roast vs. two. They've also cut back on the sweets - gone are the delicate macarons and beautiful individual layered cakes etc.. These small changes do add up when you have been many times and have come to expect that level of quality. I still think it was a delightful experience overall based on the exceptional service and overall ambiance and decor."}
{"text":"We went there during the week for lunch. The interior of this place is beautiful. Nice Parisian bistro thing going on here. They also have a few tables outside on the quiet sidestreet that has almost no traffic. It's a nice spot to have a long, lazy lunch on a summer day. We opted to sit outside.

Walked by the salad buffet when I went inside and what caught my eye were the chocolate mouse cups! Made a mental note. Lol

I just ordered an omelette. Comes with a side of salad. I know - boring. But I wasn't that hungry. It was fine.

They come by with a little dessert tray to try and entice you but I had my heart set on the chocolate mouse. So I ordered one. And that was the best part of my meal."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. I went there for lunch during the weekday in March 2015. The staff was just phenomenal, very friendly, yet professional.

I got the l'hamburger and it was delicious. The fries and sauce that came with it were equally as good. The service was quick and the staff was very aware and helpful. 

I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Had dinner at this gorgeous Parisian oasis Friday night with a large group of friends. The decor, the ambiance, the energy, hands down 5-stars. 
The atmosphere was like an upscale modern fantasy of an elegant French bistro. There were parties of sexy women from every culture laughing and drinking champagne. 

The service was genuine, friendly but non intrusive. 

We ordered: 
-Cheese straws- made to order and fallen from heaven
- French onion soup- honestly hands down the best I've ever had in my life
- Carrot salad- light and delicious
- small plates- eggplant, asparagus, frites
- le hamburger, which was so good we ordered more for the table so everyone could try it!

Then there's dessert. Which comes out on a literal silver platter on display.
It was hard to choose just one. I went with the raspberry shortcake and chocolate macaroons. You really can't go wrong with any of them.

Can't wait to go back!

Great for: birthday parties, girls nights, out of town guests, first date.

Thanks Colette!"}
{"text":"Staff are so polite! Restaurant is well decorated! You need to book it 2 weeks in advance for Sunday or Sat brunch! 

I ordered mushroom creme ( I don't remember the exact name) for breakfast! It comes with Salad! It tasted good! There was a problem with my food, the server changed it for me and apologized very nicely and they didn't put that food in my bill which is nice of them! I only paid for my drink. 

And I should say staff are good looking and well dressed ;)"}
{"text":"The interior design was great and its worth going even for that but the desserts and service wasn't good. I didnt enjoy the self service concept in the context of a more upscale coffee place."}
{"text":"I've been to Colette several times to try their desserts in the past but recently I tried their Sunday brunch! The restaurant is gorgeous in terms of it's interior and it definitely feels like you have been transported back to Paris.

Brunch is served buffet style where you go up and self serve. The price of the brunch (not including tax) is $54 per person. It is quite expensive but you get what you pay for. Reservations are a must or else you'll be waiting staring at the yummy food right in front of you. Service was attentive.

The brunch buffet included:
-  Organic cheeses, chorizo, cured ham, crackers, etc. 
-  A whole selection of fresh chilled seafood including crab claws, jumbo shrimps, lobster/seafood salad, smoked salmon...
- In terms of cooked food there were bacon, eggs, coconut pancakes, stuffed french toast, cooked sliced ham, salmon wellington.
- There is a make your own omelette bar where you order and the waiters will bring your omelette to you once it is done cooking.
- Other food included several salads and quiches.
- Lastly..the desserts!! Profiteroles, lemon tarts, croissants, etc etc. Save room for dessert, they were delicious.

I would go again only for special occasions. The price may be expensive to go but the seafood makes up for it."}
{"text":"Meh.  Prices are ridiculous for the food you get (only ordered from their counter).   You are paying for the restoration hardware decor and nothing more.   

Croissants tasted like they were from costco, the smoothie bowl is prepared in advance and sits until it becomes a gelatinous mess .  Small (tiny) drip coffee only $3! *note sarcasm.   

Would not recommend."}
