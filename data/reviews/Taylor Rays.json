{"text":"Taylor Rays Bread Pudding   One thing that reminds me of my grandmother's house is bread pudding. Grandma used to make it on Sunday. That would be the highlight of the visit for me. That's why I like the bread pudding from Taylor Rays in Mesa. It is almost as good as my grandma's.  I have tried several different restaurants Taylor Rays is the best. Famous Dave's has one that comes close. Their web site touts theirs as a melt-in-your mouth house-made bread pudding, smothered in pecan praline sauce and served with vanilla bean ice cream for $5.99. The pudding itself is a little dry, and the praline sauce is ok. The price for me is a little high. That's why I prefer Taylor Rays.  Taylor Rays is a small family run restaurant. The cost of their bread pudding is only $3.25. To me that is a great savings, most other restaurants start their desserts at $4.99. With the economy being what it is I say you have a two reasons for getting it there, the cost savings and just because it is good. That is why sometimes I get it to go. My husband and I will share it at home. They give you enough for two.  They bring you out a three inch hunk of pudding. The whiskey sauce is drizzled over the top and down the sides with a pool on the bottom of the plate. That you use to dunk every forkful in. On top of all this, sitting on the edge like a snowy white cap is a dollop of whipped topping.  On your first forkful you notice the plump juicy raisins. When you bite into one the juice just bursts in your mouth. The bread they use tastes as if they use fresh white bread, not stale left over bread that most restaurants use. The first bite you take gives you just a hint of cinnamon. Too much and it would over power this dessert. As you chew and swirl this decadent tribute to yumminess. You detect a slight custard flavor, which comes from the fresh eggs and pure vanilla extract they use. Mingled in with all the other flavors is the scrumptious whiskey sauce they use. As you savor the taste you notice the buttery flavor combined with a creamy texture. Just as you swallow you detect a slight whiskey zing. How can I forget the creamy goodness of the whipped topping, which blends it all together?  That is why sometimes when we eat there I will only eat some of my main course and take the rest home. It leaves me with plenty of room to enjoy the bread pudding. So that is why I highly recommend the bread pudding at Taylor Rays.  Bon App√©tit"}
{"text":"SORRY SORRY SORRY I went for the All U Can Eat Fried Cod today (Friday) at 5:30pm. At 5:55pm I requested two more pieces of fish. The waitress said they were out. Say what? This is FRIDAY All U Can Eat Fish day? She said but we're out of fish. Then why did you charge me $10.99 twice for two people that DID NOT have ALL the fish U can eat? Damn America! Wake up and quit treating people like their return business doesn't matter."}
