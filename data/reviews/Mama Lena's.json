{"text":"The food was terrific.  I had lobster ravioli and my wife had clams linguini .  They carry good Italian beer call Peroni and it was severed up good and cold.  

The restaurant is Ina cool building and you are automatically comfortable when you step in.  The wait staff isn't as professional as I would have expected but nonetheless they were effective.

My wife has already been back once and I am sure we will return soon and often."}
{"text":"They have created a new model for their business - cheapen the food and lower the standard for service. The sausage sandwich had perhaps a teaspoon of actual sausage, while their pizza had a little filling in the exact center surrounded by dried dough. The only dish that generally resembled it's historical antecedents was the lasagna, which had a lot of tomato puree covering a few noodles. All in all, if you must go there, stick to the side salad, the radishes were fresh."}
{"text":"Very dissatisfied with the veal Marsala.  The veal was grissly, tough and fatty.  Also,
The fried zucchini that came with the meal was awful.  The zucchini was sliced paper thin and fried with a heavy batter so all that was on the plate was batter.  I mentioned this to the waitress but she just smiled.  My husband had the osso bucco
which was good but way over priced and portion was very small."}
{"text":"I have had enough of five minute cookie cutter delivery pizzas. I have set out on a quest to find the tastiest made from scratch pizza in the South of Charlotte area.

My date and I chose Mama Lena's in Waxhaw, NC on a Sunday evening. They were not busy, as their day and weekend were winding down.

The waitress looked a little tired, but was warm and sincerely friendly. She was very attentive and helpful as I expressed my desire to try the 'signature' pizza of the restaurant.

I sipped a glass of surprisingly upper shelf Riesling wine as I waited for the entree'. The waitress kept us informed of the progress and wait time, which was no more than expected for a hand made pizza.

When our meal arrived, I could tell by the sight and smell that it was the real deal. It was so hot out of the oven we had to give it a minute to cool. The combination of sausage, pepperoni, cheese, sauce and veggies were well worth the wait.

Kudos to Mama Lena's chefs and wait staff for an excellent pizza. at a very reasonable price with excellent service.  We will be returning for an encore."}
{"text":"Food was horrible. they brought out clams with one closed clam. everything was tasteless and a waste of money"}
{"text":"Today was our first visit to Mamma Lenas.  We arrived at 4:10pm not knowing that they don't start serving until 4:30pm.  We were welcomed anyway!!  We were made to feel like we belonged.  Food and service was great.  The bread.....was awesome!  We will be back!!"}
{"text":"We decided to try Mama Lena's in Waxhaw because we wanted to try a small, local restaurant in town. It's a quaint little place and we were sat near the kitchen soon after our arrival.

There are plenty of pastas and typical Italian fare on the menu. Their fresh baked bread is delicious and you can order beer/wine by the bottle or glass. Service was attentive, once the wait staff figured out who was going to serve our table.

I ordered the manicotti, and I can't recall what my husband ordered. The food was good, but not overwhelmingly great. We enjoyed our meal, and it was reasonably priced.

I don't know if we'll be back to Mama Lena's. It's not worth a trip out of the way, but if you're in Waxhaw proper and are craving pizza or typical Italian fare, it's worth a visit."}
{"text":"I requested a salad on the menu and asked for no tuna. Essentially, I ordered a green salad.  The bill came back at $14.83. When I pointed out that I merely had a green salad, the owner was aggressive with me for merely inquiring how a green salad could cost the same as a salad with tuna.  I stated multiple times that I would be happy to pay any amount short of the same as the salad with protein and the owner was rude and short with me even telling me to \"Forget it\" when I repeatedly asked to pay a fair value. I will NOT return, given how many great Italian restaurants there are in Charlotte, that would be happy to serve a side salad for $7."}
{"text":"When they first closed down the Albemarle Rd. location, I was bummed.  Then they turned up closer to home than they were....and life was good!"}
{"text":"Mama Lena's is not large, it is not fancy and definitely not modern... But, that is what makes this place charming...it has a lovely Italian atmosphere. I like that they care more about their food than table cloths.

We have been several times. There is rarely a wait, but the restaurant is always hopping, with most tables filled and servers hurring about.

I always order from the daily specials, and have not been disappointed thus far. We have also had their lasagna and it is excellent.

Wine is reasonably priced. The bread is fresh...so fresh. I have been there twice when they are making it in their huge industrial sized mixer. It is crunchy and soft inside and perfectly accompanies their dishes."}
{"text":"Walked in, the entire floor was so sticky it took my shoe off and my husband tripped twice because of it,  walked out without ordering anything. End of story"}
{"text":"I recently discovered I have Celiac Disease and thought my life of eating pasta was over; however, the server told me that all of their pastas are gluten free! There is no sign in the restaurant or any notice in the menu mentioning gluten so it was a good thing I asked instead of just getting a salad like I planned. I got the braciola which was very good. The pasta was cooked al dente, the beef was soft, and there was plenty of sauce. Portions are large and the service was great. Even though they are on the pricey side, I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"The food was excellent, the owner Raymond awesome, wait staff awesome.The restaurant very Italian . What more could you ask for but all of that. My wife and I enjoyed our delicious authentic Italian meal while listening to Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin, if you can't understand great Italian good then this is not the place for you . From NY and being Italian makes you appreciate it. Thank you Raymond !!!!"}
{"text":"Very nice, great menu selection of common and slightly different variations of Italian dishes.  Very home made.

Chef is VERY Italian and friendly.  Does everything to include making their wonderful soft doughy bread with the hard crust from scratch.  If you have a favorite or want to do a substitution...ask.

Service was great.

Dining room is large and enough space between tables to give an air of privacy.  Nothing fancy as to decor, just clean and functional.

Lunch menu has just about everything that dinner has, but cheaper prices, so lunch is a good time to try it out.

Our table had gnocchi with \"pink\" sauce, lasagna served like you would get at home, scooped out of the dish and on your plate/bowl rather than the standard neat little square or rectangle of perfect layers, penne with complex tomato sauce and rigatoni with some other tomato and cheese sauce.  The kid menu is just fine and we got to try their pizza, which is also very good.

Wine list is simple but complete and you have good selections by the glass and with bottles.  Prices not too bad on wine."}
{"text":"I like that its in a historical building, it gives the restaurant some unique charm. There was no wait on a Friday at 6. 

Our server was nice, but maybe not that focused. Since it was our 1st time there we weren't sure about portion sizes and when my sister and I asked if a small pie was enough for us to split or would we be better with a large, she couldn't really give us an answer. Sure enough the small was fine for my nephews to share but for us when split in 1/2 it was maybe the equivalent of 1 slice at a NY style pizzeria. Needless to say I was happy I had ordered a side salad as well. 

Okay so inadequate portion aside, the pizza was really good. The sauce was a nice light tomato sauce, not to thick or herby. The pizza was very cheesy, which I don't mind. We had the primavera, and it came with onion, peppers and tomato's. I asked for mushrooms to be added but we didn't get them. I asked the server to please just make sure they were taken off the bill, and they were so it wasn't her fault they didn't get added. The pizza was thin and it got a little soggy with the toppings, but the crust was great, tasted like sourdough. My dad had the soup of the day, lentil and a sausage and pepper wedge and he said it was good. The boys split a plain cheese and liked it. 

Overall its really not a bad place. Not to mention its a lot closer to my sisters house then us driving anywhere else and its a nice change from just Papa John's pizza!!"}
{"text":"Mamma Lena's is charming Old World brick building which make this place authentic...it has a lovely Italian atmosphere. I like that they care more about their food than table cloths.

We have been several times. There is rarely a wait, but the restaurant is always hopping, with most tables filled and servers hurrying about.

The owner Raymond always comes out and visits with the customers and makes you feel like a part of extended Italian family.

Wine is reasonably priced. The bread is fresh...so fresh."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch one day and left the restaurant slightly amused, yet still hungry. This venue is understandably devoted in being an evening location with a dinner and night cap type of focus. 

The location itself is excellent, being that you can look to your left while on the main road and locate it. Parking is sufficient within the area as well. While the menu looks to be good, I was a bit underwhelmed with my lunch entree choice. The chef seemed to be the only employee within the building and had to act as a server for my table and another couple's. Although I wanted to dine in for lunch, he mistakenly thought that I wanted the entree to go and served it in a to-go box. No big deal. He made up for this by giving me a free side order. The chef even admitted that Mama Lena's was more of an evening place, and that if I was looking for something more for the $$$, I might have to check out a couple of other places. He mentioned this in a joking way, hence my amusement. And plus, the entire building was as cold as ice. Seriously, it was as 50-60 degrees inside at the time.

Nonetheless, I'm willing to give Mama Lena's another opportunity during the evening hours."}
{"text":"Seems like the reviews for this place are all over the place, and I'll just add to the confusing mess of reviews that is Mama Lena's. We went here on a Sunday night over Memorial Day weekend. It was a total ghost town--we were the only ones in the restaurant. That's never a good sign. The waitress started telling us about the specials and sort of mumbled through them because she was nervous. Really? I ordered Manicotti and we got bruschetta for an appetizer.

When the waters came out, my dad's had something floating in it. Ew. The bruschetta came out shortly after. It was a plate of tomatoes, onions, and basil with bread buried under. No cheese. It looked so unappetizing that I didn't even try it. Nobody reported that it was good, though. Dinner came out shortly after, and my Manicotti was okay. The ends of the pasta seemed hard and underdone but the middle was fine. Too much cheese though--not the restaurant's fault, just a dish I wouldn't order in the future.

While we were eating, the next 2 groups to walk in were put in the two booths of either side of us. They couldn't bother to utilize the rest of the empty restaurant. My mom didn't like her dish, and got eggplant instead which she said was cold. As mentioned, service wasn't the best. It was also quite expensive--around 60 bucks for 4 of us. Really there's no reason for me to make the drive to Waxhaw for Mama Lena's again. Oh well."}
{"text":"Wow!  Major disappointment!!  We went back after a long time of visiting and service and food quality was horrible.  The waiter mumbled everything he said and seemed  very bored in taking our orders and servicing us all together.  The bread was completely stale and my manicotti came out with sauce splattered all over dish while the pasta was nuked to death.  Owner was present and allowing this food to go out which was a huge disappointment.  Huge bummer!"}
{"text":"Best Italian I've had since Italy!! I was married to an Italian family and seriously, I know good food!  Some say the owner/ chef is cranky  but who cares!  Food is excellent and homemade, bread and Italian pastries are to die for ! Reasonable prices and my favorite restaurant by far.!  I love Waxhaw now......as long as mama Lena's is around!!!! Worth the drive, several times a week!   Service not the quickest but that's ok....sometimes it's good to stop and smell the pasta!!!!! Seriously,, try this place out!!!!"}
{"text":"Our \"go to\" local Italian restuarant for a family dinner night out or lunch break. Food is good and affordable. They make their own bread and I've had the chicken francaise, which I thought was very good."}
{"text":"Well, I thought it was closed..and it could have been for the meal we received. First..the restaurant was EMPTY. The waitress who was really doing a GREAT job just had lost her Mother-in-law an hour before her shift. The Owner said she had to come in to train a new girl. Compassion..NO! Floor was sticky, menus were sticky. We ordered a Artichoke. What we received was a flattened Oil ridden vegetable. We told the waitress - she told the owner..he did nothing! Our party was four people, One ordered Fettucine Alfredo = Under cooked Noodles with No visible sauce. One ordered spaghetti and Meatballs = Undercooked noodles with ends stuck together and two hard meatballs. My Sister and I ordered Eggplant Parmigiana = Well, it was a Grey piece of eggplant, paper thin with red sauce and a sprinkling of cheese..if it was breaded the breading had fallen off. It was horrible. I could not eat it. The entire time we saw the 
CHEF/OWNER going back and forth to microwave the food we received. He was not busy..could he have actually cooked something that night..or just reheated ever single thing we ordered. Even the Noodles, that he had to boil at some point, were not cooked enough. After telling the waitress that we could not eat the artichoke nor finish the eggplant..NOTHING  was taken off the bill.. I hear they are closing...It would be the best thing for them to do..and throw the Microwave out onto the railroad tracks!"}
{"text":"I am very pleased with this establishment!  Delicious handmade noodles,  desserts, crust, bread, sauce.....WOW!!

The building is gorgeous too, gotta love a vintage charmer in the heart of Waxhaw!

The owners wife took time to stop by our table to chat and she's an absolute doll;). 

I can't say enough good things about Mama Lena's, and I encourage you to help support this awesome local business;). 

Simply amazing;)"}
{"text":"My family and I were very disappointed with this establishment!  First of all the server seemed misrable to  be there.  Then we get the bread, which was hard as a rock.  Next 3 out of 6 of us got ranch dressing on our salads, and only one of us liked the ranch.  How can you mess up ranch?  The chicken marsala was burnt on the edges, and had no marsala taste at all.  The fettucine alfredo was cold, and super dry..not enough sauce.  The dumplings were just awful.  The only thing that was okay was the pizza.  Very disappointed, because we were really hoping that Waxhaw would have a good Italian Restaurant.....well, not this one!"}
{"text":"I've been to Mam Lena's several times.  It's good enough that I keep coming back.  My wife loves the chicken piccata.  The building is interesting and the staff is attentive.  The soups are good."}
{"text":"Historical old building.

Didn't have a wait at 6:00 on Sat. night but, by the time we left there was a line.

Wine by the glass was reasonable and the prices were average for here-$10-$18.00. 

I wasn't crazy about the sauce on my pasta or eggplant parmesan, but  my son's pizza was crispy and cheesy.

The cannoli was excellent and freshly stuffed!"}
{"text":"Mamma Mia! Delizioso! Fantastico! 

I'm 1st generation Italian America and have been to Italy many times and raised by an Italian cook. 

This is as authentic as Italian gets anywhere. Period. The fact its only 20 miles from Charlotte is even better. I've eaten at Mama Lena's at least 3-5 times each year for 3 years now and everything I've ordered has been excellent. 

The ingredients are always as fresh as possible. Their lunch sandwiches will surprise you and dinner is always perfect.

HERE'S A TIP: He bakes his own semolina, thick crust Italian loaves and for about $4.00 you can buy bread here also. It's as good as the best bread from Long Island, NYC or New Jersey and its local! YOU CAN NOT BEAT Mama Lena's Italian Bread!

Now mangia --- Mangia!"}
{"text":"Service was attentive and cared about our experience. Owner cooks and reheats food to serve as 'fresh' when not busy. Pretty obvious to me that our food, entree, was reheated. 

Spread for the fresh baked bread was weird. Spread had sugar in it! Highly unexpected for italian. Did not like it. The spread ruined the bread.

Sauce for entrees was tasty and delicious. Too bad the food tasted reheated otherwise would not have been bad, except for spread for the bread.

Sorry. Really was looking forward to this place, but it just does not cut it."}
{"text":"We've been looking for a down-home traditional italian restaurant for quite some time.  Luckily we've stumbled on Mama Lena's.  The food was great.  Everything from the bread, butter, appetizers to the main course.  Our kids loved it too.  Meals at other tables looked wonderful as well.

Quaint atmosphere included an older guy playing music on a jazz guitar.  We will absolutely be coming back again.

As you would expect from a small town restaurant, it was very affordable as well.

The only thing keeping it from being a five-star, was the salads.  They were okay - not bad, just okay."}
{"text":"My family and I have eaten here several times and each time has been great. The food is consistently good and the wait staff is nice. Their house tomato sauce is excellent."}
{"text":"Went driving around (new to the area) stopped at Mama Lena's and was very pleased.  Nice family restaurant, took us back to when life was simple, where you can have a nice meal with your family, something everybody can enjoy, even the kids ( they have pizza)   Asheigh our server was on point, friendly and attentive.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"as you see all the good restaurant leave Waxhaw or the haw please give me a break you can change the name but 90 percent of people are haters the popular place are maxwell and stacks [hamburgers] and [2eggs up]. the people give all bad review of other restaurants they say the other place was packed and this place is empty so this place is disgusting they think they are expert on all kind of food and how to run a restaurant they are all expert . all the good restaurants are in Charlotte got to drive one hour away since you moved in this quaint little town good luck."}
{"text":"Cute place, really nice people. Sauce is good but the chicken was really tuff like it was cooked, then frozen, then microwaved, & then dipped in a fryer."}
{"text":"I like this little Italian restaurant. Nice menu, good prices, and the small wine list has decent quality wines for the money.  It's not Angelo's in Little Italy  in NYC or Dolce Vita in Boston.  But hey this is Waxhaw, NC and this place is a gem in a small North Carolina town!"}
