{"text":"My friend brough me here a few months ago and I got to say I love it. Large portions, small bill, that fits me just fine. It's kind of smells stuffy in the restaurant so they can use better ventalation in the kitchen and maybe crack a window. Love the water dispenser idea, that should be in every restaurant."}
{"text":"small portions, but i love how u can put your own oyster sauce into your noodles, instead of asking like other regular wonton noodle places. also enjoyed having a hot water faucet at my table. clean and good atmosphere."}
{"text":"In terms of wonton noodles, this is as good as it gets in the surrounding area.  I think the restaurant is run by the same guys that opened Jim Chai Kee up north in Richmond Hill.  Menu is small and focused on exactly what they do best - wontons, beef brisket, fish balls, wonton noodles, rice noodles etc.  Can't really go wrong with any choice on the menu.  The wontons though are the highlight of this place.  Huge, juicy, and filled with shrimp.    Seating area is spacious and casual and comfortable enough to let you take your time with your noodles."}
{"text":"Hello Wonton for me is the equivalent of pho, but done by Chinese people.  Not to say that it tastes the same, but it's the same idea - cheap and quick but tasty. It costs average $5 for a bowl which will fill you up, and you get your food pretty much instantly.  The food was excellent but I hated the smell of the restaurant - it was really really fishy.  I kept getting whiffs of stinky after I left the restaurant too...not good if you have a meeting to attend afterwards!  The food doesn't taste fishy at all though. The wontons are a good size and the beef is really tender.  As someone mentioned, it's exactly the same as Jim Chai Kee in Richmond Hill."}
{"text":"My friend took me here when I made a visit to the great white north, Canada. The wontons here are huge! Just imagine a big ball of shrimp. The wonton soup is pretty simple: wontons and noodle in a good clean tasting soup base. All for under $5."}
{"text":"Best wontons ever! Proportions are great; $7 for a whole meal. Take out is quick too. Love the Jasmin Tea and hot water at each table.  Only accepts cash!"}
{"text":"There's nothing like eating a big bowl of Wonton noodle soup on a cold, rainy day such as today. I spotted this restaurant last night and was determined to eat here.  The outside looks quite inviting, and cute!   The inside looks fairly nice, and cozy. One of the weird features that they have that I didn't take to was a water dispenser. They give you  a cup with a tea bag inside, and they have these faucets that dispense hot water. The problem is the water isn't that hot, so the tea bag doesn't completely soak. I'm not a big fan of that system, I much prefer the teapot method, I'm not sure why Hello Wonton decided to install these things.   Especially considering their food was dirt cheap. For a bowl of Wonton Noodle soup, it costs $2.50. THAT's RIGHT, $2.50! For 4 large shrimp wontons (the size of golf balls, de-veined shrimp) with the noodles and soup, $4.50! You can't get any cheaper than that!  Around $10 for two people, cheap delish eats !"}
{"text":"so sad! this place is close! i used to come here but recently i realize that it's been replace by a korean restaurant.  the wontons are so filled with shrimp, the fish balls had bones in them i always get scared the bones might choke me but the food tasted awesome! hot water dispenser is at each table so you make your own tea. the soups tasted too much of msg... delicious but... msg is bad for you.   bye bye wonton place, i kinda miss you."}
{"text":"I tried this place on my lunch break, as I work nearby.  As other reviewers mentioned, the food is very cheap.  For $5  I had wonton filled with nice fresh tasting shrimp (nicely chopped, not mashed to paste), noodles, Chinese broccoli and broth.  It was too hot for tea so I did not use the water dispenser.  The food was quite good, especially the wonton.  However, despite the fact that the place was immaculate, I almost walked out due to the ammoniacal  smell, which I took to be fish combined with cleaning fluid.  I have a feeling there might be a cultural difference between Asians and Westerners in reactions to odours like this.  After all, it was nothing dirty, just unpleasantly fishy to my nose though the other patrons seemed to be oblivious.  Decor is nil.  Service by a mother (presumably) the owner and what appeared to be her son was very friendly, accommodating and helpful."}
{"text":"Just went there for a quick bite tonight but will never do so again.  It smelled really fishy - like slightly rank \"haam yiu\" - and it took awhile before I couldn't smell it anymore.  The beef there was definitely on the lower end and the fish balls had bones in it.  My husband found it fine but I don't like swallowing little bones.  The noodles themselves were pretty good and the wontons were tasty.  The broth I found pretty salty, perhaps over-msg'd?  And the portion of veggies they give for $2.50 I'd say is highway robbery, knowing how much it actually costs to make it!  Save your money and go to Soon Tofu instead.  I will say, though, that the staff were very friendly.  I hope they improve what they have so I can visit again."}
{"text":"I'm actually not a big fan of this kind of mix of wonton and noodles; I like mine separate. However, my mom really wanted to eat there, so we went.   My review will hopefully be as unbiased as possible. I actually liked the soup, and the wontons. I kind of wished the noodles weren't there, but the taste was delicious and the price was pretty good.   If you're a fan of this mix and match, you'll probably like this place :)"}
{"text":"Actually the wonton and fish ball is good, but not for the beef.  And the noodle itself is too soft, V2 is alot better based on the noodle.  Soup base has alot of MSG but it's common among most of the wonton restaurants.  Just curious to know is this store an optical store also?  There's contact lens solution placing on the shelves at the entrance........seems so weird."}
{"text":"I go to this restaurant regularly because of its great value and tasty food. Although their aren't a lot of food choices to choose from, but the Wonton there are amazing!   Prices have increase slightly but its still within my reasonable budget.   Overall, its a good place to go if you are under a budget!"}
{"text":"Interesting place which has hot-water dispensers at every table. The menu is very simple, and has decent tasty soup. One word of caution - if you order the seafood wonton, beware that it contains crunched bones... edible... but may freak you out. The food is probably home made, but I suspect it's frozen.   Very inexpensive and fast!"}
