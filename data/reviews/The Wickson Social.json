{"text":"This was one of the worst eating experiences I've had in a long time. Do not go here with a large group, or ever.

I ordered the pork loin and the dish that came out should have been too embarrassing to serve. The pork loin was the same size and thickness as a McDonald's breakfast sandwich's sausage patty. For brussels sprouts side, there was one quarter or one brussels sprout. This was made significantly more noticeable by the fact that around 8 people of our 20 person group ordered the same dish, and the sizes varited from what you'd expect to what I got. While my dish was the worst, others were also very bad. I suspect they ran out and started cutting down the portion sizes, hoping it would go unnoticed. It did not. 

I asked them to take the dish back and cancel my order due to the size. It was so obviously mis-proportioned that they couldn't even look me in the eye when they took it back. Then, cheque came and they tried to charge me mandatory 60% tip on my drink and dessert to make up for the lost tip on the dish. Just wow.

Also, the service was relatively poor. Dishes were dropped and entire plate of food was dumped on one of our party, all over their face and clothing. 

Go somewhere else. Our group will not be going here again."}
{"text":"The positives... Our bartender Scott was great the entire night. He was knowledgeable, friendly and can make a cocktail. The place also looks great. 

The downside. The salt shaker in the kitchen needs to have a much finer strain.  Our group had fries, red snapper, kale salad, lasagna, the burger and we all kept on looking at each other and saying the same thing. Too much salt. I had the red snapper and it is surrounded in a crispy onion string deep fried coating that was way too salty. 

The price of the cocktails was also silly. They use small ice cubes that melt super fast so despite our great bartender, the cocktails tasted like water in a minute. However, the worst part was getting the bill for and Old fashion with Bullit bourbon (around $40 at the lcbo for a 40oz) with a very measured pour and it was $18."}
{"text":"We had a seriously amazing and uncrowded (which it won't be for long once more people find out about this hidden gem, and once all the construction in the area is done) valentines brunch here. We had the pancakes and some sort of pork dish (I forget what it was called, but they change their menu seasonally anyway! Extra points for that!) and both were exceptional. The interior design is to die for - cozy, quirky and chic. A fun mix of textures and colours, a preserved historic gothic facade, what's not to love? Atmosphere is great for brunch or drinks. The service was excellent both times I've been. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"My first time here and wow. Best burger in the city and a great place to have a few drinks with friends. There is this massive carpet wall mural by a Toronto artist that was manufactured in Germany.......simply stunning."}
{"text":"Fun vibe with great decor and outstanding staff. The food and drinks are tasty and the space is excellent for events."}
{"text":"Had nothing to complain about our visit on a Sunday evening! The food was surprisingly good with generous portion. My favourite was that night's special fried chicken. The chicken itself was crunchy on the outside and tender and juicy inside. The biscuit that came with the dish was the BEST I've ever had. It was moist, not-too-dense, and had a delightful light taste of cheese. The sauteed vegetable and oat-like grain were interesting additions to the dish, making it more flavouful but still well-balanced. The beer selection here is also worth mentioning. I never liked the taste of beer, so my husband chose a light-taste one to share with me. I actually enjoyed it. Had a sip of my friend's choice of dark beer, and liked it too! The place itself is very spacious with modern decoration. All in all it was a perfect dinner here."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out and have dinner.  Nice that there js finally a decent place to eat in the hood. The crustacean tagliatelle was good but they took it off the menu. Its been replaced with mushroom.  I tried the mushroom and was delicious too, not as good as the crustacean.   Place seems very busy on Friday nights. During the week, it's a nice cozy place for dinner."}
{"text":"We popped into this place after checking Yelp and not being able to get into Bar Volo's Peche Mortel event.

Great atmosphere and the service and food were both really good.

I had the lasagna, which comes with a salad with a touch of vinaigrette and some pickled onion.  The lasagna was very good and I was alllmost able to finish the generous portion they served.

My husband ordered a side of the parsnip cheese tots, which were amazing! (Yes, I yoinked one)

Friends we were with ordered a side of fries with a nice dipping sauce and some wings and they enjoyed those as well.

The beer selection is decent although I stuck to mango-tangerine mimosas, which were on special for $10 each on Saturday - delish!

Although there are plenty of restaurants in the city, I can definitely see us coming back here again in the near future and I'm glad we stopped in."}
{"text":"Guys, this place totally exceeded all of my expectations. I walk by this place quite often and thought it looked nice -- the reviews on yelp are okay, so we went there tonight. First off, i love the way the interior was decorated. It was very elegant and modern, with a unique flair (the wall mural!). The people who work there were incredibly friendly. I'd say, the walk to the bathroom was also fun, you get a peek in the kitchen and also see some extra, lounge-like space they have in the back. 

In addition to the great ambience and nice service, the food was incredible. We started off with the spicy buffalo fried okra -- that was wonderful. It was such a unique dish. Okra fried until crunchy, slathered with sour cream and buffalo sauce. It is a bit spicy so if you don't eat spicy at all, this won't be the dish for you. The food portions were HUGE. I got the acadian seafood fricotand when the plate came, it was overflowing with clams and mussels, and buried underneath all of that shelled goodness, there were pieces of monkfish that were so tender yet firm. The sauce that everything was bathed in was incredible.. and it also came with bread with some kind of garlic spread on it -- that dipped in the sauce.. no words. Two members of our party got the night's special with fried chicken and cheese biscuits and those were lovely too. The cheese biscuit was nice and crunchy on the outside and soft and moist on the inside.. all with cheesy goodness. 

After we paid the bill, we ended up staying maybe another hour just catching up,  and during this time they continued to come by and fill our water --That is not common!

I think it says a lot that the 4 of us, who love to eat, gave this place a unanimous 5 star. Love it -- definitely a good spot for dates, friends' get togethers, anything!"}
{"text":"Accommodating staff with great bar snacks and a great atmosphere. Good for larger parties"}
{"text":"One of the best bars in the neighborhood!
Sit yourself down at the bar for a pint.

They have a good selection of cider and beer in tap. The sour beer isn't always available but they have lots to choose from.

I'm a fan of County cider and they have a rotation. 

As for food - I like the fries with housemade ketchup. I can't say I'm blown away by the other items I've tried, but they still hit the spot!

This place has a chill vibe and I like it."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is amazing, very trendy without being pretentious. 
My favourite in the menu are the fried yam balls and the duck wings, SO good! The burger is good (it is literally chopped meat so don't expect a traditional meat patty) and the fries are great."}
{"text":"Very nice find, good portions of delicious food, awesome service and really spacious, lofty interiors"}
{"text":"We've been eating out a lot lately.  Tonight was Wickson Social. Nostalgia strikes if you remember 70s  Disco scene.  This was Katrinas and then Colbys and now it's a pub with grub. This was 2nd try. Good food. Good service. But it's not comfortable. Stools! Little  stools.  Give me a good chair and a sturdy table please.  The food is worth the price but insist on a table with chairs (not little stools) if you are making a reservation. If you're a late diner, bring a flashlight for the menu. The food is inventive and the desserts are good too. Baked Alaska was a nice surprise but there are no backrubs on the menu  for the old and feeble like me. Better seating would give this gastropub a couple more stars."}
{"text":"This place was awesome!! The apple pie cocktail and the kerfuffle was soooo good! The pretzel bite app is also delicious."}
{"text":"Love the food and the decor. The service was amazing and the host as well. Don't mean to sound like a pain but I hate the music. I wish it was more house music. This is the place to be!!!!!!!:)"}
{"text":"A girlfriend and I came here for some Friday after work relaxing. It was busy but we got a decent seating at one of the small booths, which also have some tiny stools to perch upon. (Ok, I have to admit, I'm tired of weird seating at bars - what's wrong with normal banquettes and chairs?)
We had some drinks and wanted some appetizers but honestly there's not many to choose from. We had some parsnip tots   Which were yummy, then some wings and fries. Fries were ok - but seemed dry. We got the wings \"medium\" but I'm still unsure about the sauce...wasn't hot sauce, wasn't barbecue...it was, a bit strange. Also the wings were super tiny which made me feel bad for whatever life that chicken had previous to being wings.
Service was attentive and prompt!
May go back, but not for wings."}
{"text":"Great decor, not great food. The staff very very pleasant, our server was lovely. 

Two burgers ($19 with fries) were ordered at our table and were dressed very, very differently and the server apologized and offered to bring the extra toppings on a side plate. The serving of fries, maybe 10 on the plate, were small, cold and soggy. A friendly staff member apologized before we said anything about the fries and brought over a bowl of fries. The burger was fine but you could find better elsewhere for a lower price (like The Drake). 

Both salads on the menu were shared and unremarkable. The roasted lamb sandwich ($16),was very nice and the salad and coleslaw it came with were also tasty. 

Our table didn't have dessert, we were somewhat disappointed with the food and didn't want to get anything more.

Weird menu overall. It has lasagne, burgers and over priced seafood. It'd be great if they could decide on what they should be serving & perfect it."}
{"text":"Polite and attentive service, robust tap selection,  and the food is a cut above your typical gastropub. Hard to say no to a pint and a snack when you're in the area."}
{"text":"Brb, getting social over at the Wickson Social.  This place is such a great addition to this area! A pretty unassuming place from the outside, but when you walk in you are transported to a colourful and classy bar that honestly I would have never of guessed would be here.

This place has it all- A gigantic beautiful bar area, multiple rooms, great food and drinks, and even a mural of some crazy woodland critters on the wall. The ambience is  so warm and welcoming. 

I didn't even notice there was a whole other room in the back until I went to the washroom. That area would be really great for a private party or larger group get together for sure. 

I would even venture in this area just to go here, and you should too!"}
{"text":"Good service and interior, but overpriced considering the quality and portion of food. Risotto undercooked. Pea to rice ratio was poor. Asked for medium rare lamb and it came medium well. Taglietelle was sub-par. Edit: our group went for dinner."}
{"text":"Service: great and friendly staff. It was a Wednesday night and we were seated promptly. 
Food: us three sisters went for the Winterlicious menu. We worked and studied nearby so thought this would be a cool place to check out. The appetizers were very good and made us excited for the meal.
Unfortunately, the entrees were horrible. Two of us got the haddock which was dry, overcooked, and bland. The fish sat in a bed of beans which were a mix of mushy and raw. Everything was tasteless and it reminded me of frozen dinners. One of my sisters got the daube beef which we agreed was the better of the two entrees. The beef was tough and dry. The sauce was also bland.
The deserts were pretty good and unique. Definitely on par with our appetizers if not better. I don't have a sweet tooth but I cleaned my plate!
I understand that the restaurant wants to profit from this event but I'm never going back here. They should be treating all customers with good food and drink but we felt like the cheaped out on us just to make a couple bucks.
The restaurant itself has good atmosphere and the drink selection was pretty good."}
{"text":"This place is a gem! Tucked away from the hustle and bustle , and touristy Toronto, this is an oasis of incredible ambiance and out of this world food. I was blown away by its atmosphere , the amazing and attentive staff, and the clear creativity of their dishes. The cocktails are impressive as well. Nothing overly \"hipster\" but definitely well-crafted and they pack a punch! 

I had the deep fried okra which was something I never expected to enjoy but I was pleasantly surprised.What a revelation! I then had the lentil chilli which was amazing. Spicy but not to the point of being painful - just an amazing dance of flavours!

The seating and artwork are great - warm and welcoming . Felt comfortable and hard to leave. 

I recommend this place whole heartedly to anyone and everyone!

Thanks you for a great experience!"}
{"text":"I really don't want to be that DOWNER of a reviewer, but here we go. 

I came here with 4 other friends on a Friday night around 6. We all arrived at different times, I was the second to get there, and instead of being led through the beauty of the dining hall by the host, I was brought somewhere else. Even though the restaurant wasn't full, the host guided me to some awkward downstairs location, past the bathrooms, past the kitchens, to a really ugly dining room. 

It really seemed like we weren't cool enough to sit with the people out in the front, and we were embarrassing the restaurant so we were placed in some god-awful location. My friend who got there first said that the host told him that patrons who were eating would sit downstairs and those were drinking would sit upstairs - or something along those lines. (Turns out this was a lie because on our way out, we saw food being served on the nice first floor). Boy was it LOUD down there. We were all shouting on top of each other, and the air conditioning made us all really cold. After the whole dining experience, my friend said his ears were RINGING because of how loud the downstairs was. It was also friggen dark down there. The light was incredibly dim, and none of the curtains were up even though it was still bright outside. 

Also, we asked for a table for five people, and initially we were given two sad little tables in the corner, with a fifth chair awkwardly placed perpendicular to the rest of us. I had to ask the waiter to keep give us an extra table so we could all eat comfortably.  

I usually pick really neat restaurants for our once-a-month get together but I was actually terribly embarrassed to bring them here. 

The meals were mediocre at best and it was very pricey. 

I wasn't too hungry, so I got the Spring Risotto and it didn't taste too good. For dessert, my friend and I shared the flourless chocolate cake, which was quite hard and tasted like a brownie. My friends didn't like their dishes very much - especially the pasta and the whipped cheesecake. 

Overall, The Wickson Social is a very mediocre place. 

Unfortunately, I will never come back here again."}
{"text":"I was here on a date a few weeks ago and I have to say, I had never heard of this place before but I was very pleasantly surprised. Loved the eclectic decor and artwork as soon as I walked in the door. There was a selection of craft beers which is always a plus for me and although the waitress couldn't give me a suggestion, she was very nice and offered to ask the bartender for me. My date and I only ordered drinks so no comment on the food but everything else was great. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the place unexpectedly started clearing out at about 12:00 am on a Saturday, to the point where my date and I were almost the only ones left in the front room at 12:30. I thought it was quite odd considering it seemed to be a cool place. Who knows, maybe people were heading further downtown as the night went on but it was definitely a strange feeling to be the only people left in a bar that had been so busy just 45 mins earlier."}
{"text":"A solid \"destination\" addition to this part of town's kind of limited creative and/or nice looking restaurant/bar options! 

I came here on a busy Friday and was immediately super into the vaguely gothic windows, exposed brick, laid back \"night\" vibe and nice airy ceiling height. Acoustics were good (you can more or less hear your date) as was the music, and there's a lower key back room which also has cool ceilings and big windows. It looks tailor made to parties/corporate events/whatever people do in back rooms with chill couches these days. 

Chill.

Had both of the \"egg white\" related cocktails and was impressed by both - strong, not too sweet, good flavour and nifty presentation; the bartender torched an apple in front of me, which made the whole drinking process somehow more entertaining. 

Service here was quick, friendly and eager to please - I found everyone super responsive and genuine. The food is very good though not quite excellent --prices are reasonable, the options range from basic to a bit creative, and you'll certainly leave full and happy. I had the ham hawk, which was delicious but took 3 unnecessary years off my life (I won't miss them particularly) and my partner had the chicken, which was juicy and delicious. 

Will make this a regular stop!"}
{"text":"A very fancy bar downstairs of a very fancy condo. I can't rate the food because I haven't tried it yet but the drinks are very good and the service our group had yesterday was exemplary.  Shout out to our awesome Scottish barman and our waitress. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"The Wickson Social is has everything going for it. Good food, good service, a patio, excellent customer service. However, the only downside is that the place is very \"usual.\" There is nothing that distinguishes it from the competition. It is just a good, simple, safe option."}
{"text":"Not too bad, good mixed drinks, nice atmosphere, and a very good kitchen and wait/bar staff.

I had the hand chopped burger and that was pretty damn good! my date had the lasagna and that also tasted and looked great too, it's a good place for a date with their mini booths, subdued lighting and excellent service, this place was not mindblowing, very adequate, I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Went to newly opened The Wickson Social for dinner today. We were greeted quickly and shown to our table right away. Servers are very attentive, knowledgeable and check in often. 
The portions are smaller to encourage sharing. We ordered three mains and two sides and found that to be the perfect amount of food. 
As our mains we had the bison with risotto, 100 day aged beef, veal tenderloin. As our sides we chose the mashed potatoes and the brussel sprouts. All were delicious but our favourite was definitely the bison with risotto and the mashed potatoes. 
The space is decorated nicely and is feels cozy while also being spacious. 
It's great to have a new restaurant in the neighbourhood. It's even better that it's a place with great food and great service. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Every place these guys open is an instant classic. 

A perfect spot for an after-work unwind sesh.  You'll walk in and instantly feel at ease. Stellar drink list. I haven't tried a bite that I didn't enjoy. 

Highlight: Love those sour beers - Jellyking IS king. For just a small nibble with drinks try the spicy buffalo fried okra."}
{"text":"Lovely restaurant! Have been a few times for drinks and went for dinner last night for the first time, the food was amazing! I had the fall grouper which was cooked perfectly and in a delicious sauce. Service was also lovely, consistent with their other spots (Oxely and Queen & Beaver). Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars! The Wickson has been empty both times I've come here for lunch, which is a shame because I'd love for a spot like this to stick around in the neighbourhood. The food and lovely service is good - to say nothing of the gorgeous room and decor. It's just a little too pricy when it's not quite \"fancy\", either. If the price point was lower and there were some drink specials, I'd be there more often.

The menu changes frequently (which is great!) so I can't recommend specific dishes, but I've had a delicious creamy tagliatelle, a decent (canned) crab salad, and more than one tasty cocktail."}
{"text":"A bunch of us came to hang out, grab a drink and get some snacks.  I like the feel of this place, the ambiance and the lighting.  It feels comfy while not overly crowded and noisy.

We had a corner table with 6 of us and we all ordered drinks and some of us food.  The Wickson has a pretty wide variety of cocktails and drink selection.

I ended up ordering a Left Field Maris pale ale to go with a hand chopped burger and fries.  The burger while not very large was nice break from the factory produced burgers I'm more accustomed to consuming on a regular basis.  This was a little bit of a treat.  

When I ordered the burger I was asked how I would like it cooked... my reaction was, \"you can do that?\".  Typically I thought burgers were always cooked medium well or up that being the law or something.  Regardless I had asked for medium.  The burger was very good the meat patty being made by hand was a huge difference.  There is a difference and while it had cheese it was overall just the right thing at the right time.  It didn't stand out as one of the best burgers I've had in recent memory at a drink lounge but it was classy, just like the Wickson.

The service here was attentive and friendly and I like the whole feel of this place.  It's sort of hidden off Yonge on a residential street (St. Joseph) which I knew of because my sister used to live basically where this place exists now."}
{"text":"We went there for the first time for brunch. Food was excellent. Everything was prepared to perfection. The restaurant was pretty empty for Saturday 11am. I don't think this place is well known yet. I also loved the decor of restaurant.

We will be back for more. :-)"}
{"text":"Their weekend brunch is indulgent and great. It's a little on the expensive side, which makes it a good pick for one of those treat-yourself-weekends. It's a great place for drunk brunch. Their french toast is to die for."}
{"text":"Love the old world decor of this place, the chill ambience, the delicious cocktails and friendly service. The food is just ok but I wasn't going for that really. I like that it's not too busy so you can have a good conversation. Have already been there twice in two weeks!"}
{"text":"I was here Friday for a former coworker's farewell party and it was a great experience.

I arrived early after school by myself. They had a small patio set up outside which looked nice. The decor inside was beautiful too.

As everyone arrived, we were seated in a corner section not far from the entrance. It was nice and cosy. We ordered some appetizers and wines. Too bad I can't comment on their wines as I don't drink. But they seem to have a good selection of them. The appetizers tasted good, yet they were just typical bar food.

Service was efficient, friendly and attentive. Staff tried their best to accommodate us. They even brought cute candles to our table as it got dark as well, which I found quite cute.

Usually I am not a bar person but I was very happy to catch up with my colleagues in such a nice environment. I will definitely come back and recommend it to friends who like a great bar :)"}
{"text":"Hmm well that lentil chilli with goat cheese and cilantro/corriander was dee-licious, however $19 seems unreasonable. The service is great. I especially loved it when the waitress whispered 'My pleasure' ;)"}
{"text":"Been here several times for drinks and have really liked the decor and atmosphere. Tried the brunch today and was absolutely impressed with the service. Brunch is served until 3pm. We walked in at 2:51pm to try our luck and the waitress was just so welcoming - never made us feel like we gave them extra work or made us feel rushed. I ordered the smoked salmon eggs & scones with hollandaise sauce while my boyfriend ordered the morning standard. Decent food, although a little on the saltier side. Prices are a little high for this neighborhood but I wouldn't mind coming again as I live 2 minutes away."}
{"text":"Came in last week for dinner with a group of 4.

The decor and ambience of the restaurant was very unique. 
They consider themselves an upscale version of a pub and I only agree. It's a great change from your typical chain pub/ restaurant. 

Their menu is on the smaller side but nothing on the menu disappoints!
Our server was very attentive and gave us good suggestions on the menu. I'll be back to try everything else out. 

I do want to see them stay around for a while. 

Hence I would suggest the following:

More cocktail options
Different sizes of cheese platters 
More cheese options
More main options"}
{"text":"Stumble on The Wickson by accident and glad I did. You can tell that they care about their food. Had the grilled cheese and bacon for lunch and it was great.  Respect for making your own bacon. Beer was good too."}
{"text":"I had been dying to try Wickson Social for a little while and finally had the opportunity to head in for their brunch. The restaurant is gorgeous inside, and offers a variety of seating depending on what you're feeling. 

The food is damn good. I ordered the eggs Benedict which is presented on a scone (which I would have never thought of) but wow. It was amazing. The eggs were cooked to perfection, offering the extra creamy element to a buttery and delicious hollandaise. The scone was fluffy yet tasty, and made the entire dish unique in flavour composition.  

The French toast was delicious. Good flavour combination but honestly does not live up to the eggs benny. 

The coffee was gross. Ick Ick Ick. I asked for a French press and was instead given and americano. I'm not exactly sure if the servers wanted to try out the new espresso machine as they had mentioned that they just got it and weren't exactly sure how to make an espresso.. But I was not impressed. I wouldn't recommend trying the coffee unless you like it really bitter and with a bit of spice. 

Service was different. We were greeted by two different servers who both took care of us throughout our stay. Not sure if they were pooling tips as it was very dead, but it kind of made things confusing and messed up with the flow of service. Regardless, they were both very professional and quite proficient in the menu. I applaud their efforts. 

Menu is very expensive, likely why it's not very busy. The food is worth the price, but definitely not the kind of place you would go if you're on a budget."}
{"text":"We dropped in here on a Friday night walking back from the ROM....  Heard lots of great things about this place so thought we would give it a shot.

It's very loud - they should do something to dampen the noise.  

We sat at a table and when we didn't see a waitress we got our drinks at the bar.   Then, a guy came over (assuming he was a manager or owner?) and told us we could not sit at the table as the area was booked for a private function (although no signs on the tables?) and had to go elsewhere.  Was strange because lots of other people were in the area already.  He came across as kind of rude... 

Anyway, we found one seat at the bar and ordered our drinks.  They took a while to get made and they were fine.  Bartender was super nice... she was the highlight of the visit.

Don't think I will go back and not sure if I would recommend it to my friends.   There are a lot of great places to go in the city without the attitude or the noise."}
{"text":"The place itself looks great; cool decor, ambient lighting, friendly service. No complaints there. 

I gave this place two stars because I wasn't impressed/attracted to anything on their menu. We finally ordered the squash fritti which was...flavourless and undercooked, and the grilled halloumi which was just so garlicky. Both were hugely overpriced. 

I could maybe come here again for a drink but there's better places around this area in my opinion."}
{"text":"Visited the Wickson Social for brunch on a Saturday morning. We had The Morning Standard (basically a classic English breakfast) and the Smoked Salmon breakfast bowl. The potato rosti in the breakfast bowl was very thin and was deep fried to a crisp, but everything else was fine. The Morning Standard came with a thick crusty piece of bread, great for soaking up the eggs and sauce from the baked beans. The beans were cooked with tomato sauce and (presumably) braised beef and tasted strangely reminiscent of Chef Boyardee (and I mean that in the most endearing way possible). 

Overall the brunch was okay, but unremarkable."}
{"text":"Great spot with a lot of potential... a few kinks to work out but definitely has promise..   Went for brunch today with a couple of friends.  Was quite excited and the menu looked good, the photos I'd seen looked very appealing, and a little word of mouth had me fairly eager to try it out.  The food was good, not great, but good.  

They could benefit from having a huddle with new staff coming on shift so they know if they are out of anything... our server sold us on the Risotto and then his colleague jumped in and said they ran out Saturday evening... then she went back in to the kitchen and found out it was ready again and good to go.  

When you order your brunch, please note. It doesn't come with any sides.  They are priced separately at $6.00/unit.  We learned this when our eggs bennie showed up, a la  carte.   Just something to remember.  This isn't their fault, it was our fault for not understanding the menu properly.  Through better communication, and making sure the customer knows that their order doesn't include a side of toast or potatoes the experience would have been better.  Service, and cleanliness were good as well.  

I will definitely give them another chance... they've only been open for 6 weeks."}
{"text":"Beautiful space tucked in on St. Joseph street. There is outdoor seating so get here before the summer weather fades!

Service is exceptional; we especially loved Saskia who was bubbly and super helpful - all her recommendations were on-point. Crudo of Bay Scallops & Sea Vegetables is fabulous. I haven't seen the Baked Alaska elsewhere so, definitely give this dessert a try if you enjoy peace & raspberries & meringue."}
{"text":"Just went here on a Saturday night around 11 pm for late night drinks with friends and have to say, I really like the vibe of this place. Really laid back but with a very cool decor. Not too many people there because it was so late. 

We asked the staff what they would recommend based on our preferences, which is generally sweet, nothing with a strong alcohol taste to it. He mentioned the Pumpkin Spice Sour and ooohhh, it was delicious!!! Only a hint of alcohol, very smooth and egg white on top. One of my other friends tried a more berry/fruit blend (forgot name) but they werent too into it. However, I found it alright. It matched what we requested of the staff.

Drinks may be a bit pricey at $13 and up for cocktails but pretty good and similar to what you pay elsewhere. Definitely would recommend and will come back too. Possibly a good option for group outings or celebrations."}
{"text":"This place was not so bad until I got the absolute worst waitress serving me. I was so worried about her spitting in my food that I couldn't really enjoy what I was about to eat. In short, I downloaded this app specifically for this one occasion. Cheers !"}
{"text":"This is a really lovely spot. Lovely cocktails, great oysters, friendly service. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"3.5 STARS

A few friends and I decided to check this place out to get some food and some drinks and just chill.  Located on a side street it doesn't look like much from the outside but wow when you enter in (through the drapes!) it looks so fancy inside - in that dark and sexy vibe.  Having no reservations our group of 7 had no issues getting a table.  

The menu for food isn't extensive but interesting (at least the dinner/late night menu) - the drinks are all unique and lovely sounding.  I had the Cucumber Collins with coriander.  I love coriander and will pretty much order anything with it in it.  It had a light and refreshing taste with that coriander syrup really coming through.  Yum for me!   As I only wanted something to nibble on I decided on the olives and bread snack.  It was ok - olives and bread - you can't screw that up too much..lol.  Others at the table ordered wings (yum) and some cheese tater tot things - also good.  Another person had a burger - I didn't have a bite but others who did said it was really juicy and good.  

I found the service a little lacking - it seemed after a while there was only one server - he was very polite and nice but it took awhile to get our order in, the food, and then to pay.  The restaurant was about half to 3/4 full when we were there so I think they need another server later in the evenings.  However this wouldn't stop me from coming back.  Per their sign they also do brunch so I definitely want to check that out soon."}
{"text":"Based on finances, more of a treat than a regular spot.  Excellent chopped burger and fries.  $19.
Really appreciated the homemade ketchup.
Really nice interior."}
{"text":"I love the decor of this place.  The paintings on the walls, the furniture, the lighting...it gives off a very trendy, modern with antique accents type of feel.  

I came here with my brother and our spouses for dinner.  We tried a few appetizers to share:  the bacon bunnies, the onion bahji & raita, and the parsnip cheddar bites.  I didn't care for the bites as I was not a big fan of parsnips and I found they were overpowering.  The rest of my party did, however.  The bacon bunnies and the onion were both really good.  3 apps were perfect for the 4 of us to share.

For dinner my boyfriend got the burger.  He didn't care for it, but the fries were really good!  Homemade ketchup to accompany.  My brother and I both had the lamb.  We basically licked the plate clean it was so delicious.  My sister-in-law got the chilli and did the same.

We were a little surprised there was no espresso machine for an after dinner treat.  

I'll be coming back here, and can't wait to try their brunch.  

Apparently they do room service for the people who live in the attached condo - I'll start looking for openings.  lol"}
{"text":"Came here for a Saturday morning brunch and it wasn't busy at all. This place is huge and I imagine gets super busy in the evenings. The spirits selection was quote impressive and I think I'll have to come back on a Friday night. 

Service was great, our server was polite and amazingly patient with our group of 10. In terms of food I got the pancakes and they tasted much better than it looked. 

All in all I thought it was a great experience. I finished off with a nice BBT next door at The Alley. Bonus!"}
{"text":"Disappointing. Even though we made a reservation--ordering from the \"feasting\" menu--weeks in advance, we waited almost two hours for our food. Portions were very small and honestly mediocre in terms of taste and quality. We were in the back/downstairs room, which was chilly, dimly lit and uninviting. Exorbitant price for a lackluster experience."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Stopped on for lunch and had the burger and kale salad, both were really tasty but it was the drinks that sold us on this place. We tried a few different cocktails; the lavender sour, blueberry bourbon fizz, a kerfuffle and their tequila negroni. They were all great as was the service. Also the decor was really cool, modern but cozy."}
{"text":"Great spot if you want to get away from the typical hot spots in Toronto. We drove past this place several times wanting to check it out - it looks very cool. They have amazing cocktails, delicious food, late night menu that has a few apps, a burger and lasagna and I thought the service was fantastic. I'm looking forward to going back again!"}
{"text":"I went here on the strength of the Yelp reviews, and I must say that I was a little disappointed.  The space is fine; high ceilings and a funky anthropomorphic mural dominate the room.  It was dark & loud for a Thursday, however, and the bar stools are annoyingly anchored too far from the bar so that you have to lean against them (rather than sit on them) to reach the bar comfortably.  The food started out well with an amuse bouche of fig, honey and house made goat cheese ricotta.  My 
oyster appetizer, however, was tepid and fishy, and was served with a pepper vinegar concoction that I found distasteful.  The burger that followed -- topped with Canadian bacon and cheddar -- was just ok.  

Toronto has a million better options than this place."}
{"text":"What a great vibe and fun place to hang out.   Vibe is cool anytime I have gone."}
{"text":"Ordered their eggs, scones, hollandaise with spinach and earl gray latte. Loved the food and the service. We sat on their patio which was tiny but comfortable."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with a couple friends for winterlicious! Overall had a nice evening with some pros and cons:

Pros:
-Awesome beer list
-Really nice interior
-Decent service
-Appetizer (pea and leek soup) was delicious

Cons:
-Dessert of sticky toffee pudding tasted burnt 
-Main (mushroom pie with salad) was just ok

Would definitely come back for a drink and maybe try some of the items from the main menu. Worth a visit!"}
{"text":"The Tuna Niçoise salad is absolutely to die for! Hard boiled eggs that were fresh and soft as well as a tart dressing . The tuna was cooked medium which was perfect! Also enjoyed a gorgeous plate of mussels with an amazing light fresh and spicy curry! Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Went here for a team dinner, there were 13 of us.  It was great!  Food was good, everyone was happy, cocktails were good and kept flowing."}
{"text":"Just had brunch there today. The decor was nice - high ceilings, proper bar, cute little booths along the perimeter and it is actually quite a large space. I had the smoked salmon eggs benny. The salmon is smoked in house and the scone that it was on (instead of english muffin) was fresh and baked in house.  My boyfriend got the classic breakfast. I tried it and the eggs were done perfectly. The sourdough bread that came with his meal was also baked fresh. The server was pleasant. All in all, a great new brunch space!"}
{"text":"Excellent spot for brunch. I have not ever been disappointed with the brunch, dinner on the other hand is a different story. 

Brunch I almost always order the eggs Benedict and get a side of potatoes. The eggs Benedict is served on cheese scones which could be sold on their own. The potatoes are the real reason I always go back. The fact that you can always get a table without a wait is a bonus as well. 

I love the burger at the queen and beaver so was excited when this place opened. I have had it 5 times at Wickson and was disappointed the last time. The bacon was so burnt that I had to take it off in order to eat the burger. I was so hungry that I didn't say anything.  I have also tried the pork with grits on a different occasion.  It was meh and for sure not worth the money. The pork was cooked well but the flavour did not work. The texture of the grits was weird and did not compliment the pork. My friend tried it and disagreed with me so it may just be a personal preference. 

Definitely check this place out for brunch, and if you are there for dinner. Do your self a favour and play it safe and get the burger."}
{"text":"Was here for drinks with friends a few weeks ago. There had a nice drink and wine selection and were just off yonge street. The atmosphere was warm and friendly and quiet. Nice to catch up in a nice location."}
{"text":"I liked it here. Had an unhurried light meal with friends consisting of drinks and a bunch of small starters. Everything was pretty good. Service was attentive and friendly. We ordered the white bean and halloumi dip, flatbread, a couple cheeses, and risotto. Risotto was a tad salty. Inviting warm atmosphere inside, and the bar area became busier as the night laboured on. Definitely a nice spot for a drink or cocktail and snacks."}
{"text":"Intimate atmosphere and knowledgeable staff - great selection of drinks. Cute little spot that's kind of off the beaten path in an area that doesn't have enough places like this. I only had drinks so I can't speak to the food unfortunately, but wouldn't mind coming back here again to try!"}
{"text":"Visited the Wickson Social yesterday with 10 colleagues and most of us decided to order from the Summerlicious menu. I e-mailed the restaurant the day before requesting the reservation, and they were great at getting back to me within a couple of hours confirming the reservation. 

Once we were ready to order, I asked our waitress that my dishes not include onions, she asked if it was a preference or allergy, and I told her it was a preference but that I really hated them (should not have to emphasize that but I did). However, there seemed to be no issue with my request. 

Once the mains arrived, it looked like my dish was the one without onions (I went with the Summerlicious menu and many of us ordered the same dish). Once I began eating, I found a large ring of onion under my salmon, and I pulled it out with my fork and put it on the side of my plate. I was going to call our waitress over, but by the point a) I had started eating (because I had trusted that my request had been adhered to, and b) because getting her attention was simply too difficult. When she passed by at some point, she did see it and laughed while she said, \"found one\" and kept on walking. Yeah, I found one, and that's a problem!

Two of my colleagues shared the cheesecake dessert off the regular menu, and it came with rhubarb - or that's what we though anyway. They said they did not like it, and I found it odd because I love rhubarb so I stole one from their plate and spitted it out. Omg, it tasted like onion! And they said, \"sorry! we were going to tell you that but you grabbed it so quickly.\" Then the whole table got curious, and they began to try it, and all agreed that it tasted like onions on the cheesecake, and not at all like rhubarb. I told the staff and they agreed, so they gave my friends a new dessert - but it was too late for me. I was ready to throw up because I really am not joking when I say that I can't eat onions. It really makes me sick - the look, the smell, and most certainly, the taste!

All in all...

Food:

Hit and miss - the colleague who ordered the pasta off the regular menu loved it. The salmon some liked and some disliked. The salmon was smoked, so some found the smoke overpowering. Almost everyone at the table needed condiments to enhance their dish - we requested lemon, salt, pepper and vinegar. One colleague asked to have her salmon heated because it got to the table cold, and what she got back was hot and overcooked salmon. 

Service: 

Not great. It was not easy flagging down our waitress, and when they did not have the beer I ordered, I was offered another one, but it surprised me that they charged me for it. 99% of the time, when a drink on the menu is not available, they offer you something else, but don't charge you for it. Anyway, that's been my experience. And I most certainly did not appreciate the amusement and laughter when an ingredient I explicitly asked that it not be in my food, appeared in my food. 

Even with the average and sometimes annoying service, we were forced to pay the 18% tip as is the case for large groups at most restaurants. We did not feel the service deserved 18%.

Portions:

I was happy with the portions, and we left full. 

Ambience:

The space is open, colourful and modern. I liked the space.

In sum:

Considering that this restaurant is near work and my home, I would have considered returning and trying other items on the menu. However, the service and issues with some of the dishes left a lot to be desired - so returning is not likely."}
{"text":"I did my birthday at the Nest, Wickson's private room, and it was amazing! Excellent customer service, delicious food, beautiful room with a private bar, TV and sound system, and a very reasonable minimum spend. Staff went above and beyond to make sure everyone had a great time. No issues with billing, which is rare for a party of 20+ people (I paid for some stuff and the rest was separate bills, so it was complicated). It's been a few days since my party, and I'm still very impressed with the quality of service I received (I work as an event planner, so I've been to quite a few venues). I highly recommend Wickson Social and the Nest to everyone, and special thanks to Steve, Alycia and Adele for making my birthday ideal."}
{"text":"Came here for a Sunday dinner with my friend the other night. Loved the cocktail menu and the ones we ordered were delicious! Food was good, lots of appetizers for sharing. Prices were a little on the higher side but it was worth it. Staff were friendly and the space was cool."}
{"text":"My usual dinner party and I decided to try the newest entry to the neighborhood Wickson Social.  Wickson Social is the most recent project of the folks who brought us the Oxley as well as the Queen and Beaver Public House.  I have walked passed multiple times without noticing as there is much construction in the area and the door is fairly inconspicuous.  The main bar and dining area boast a contemporary stylish decor.  It was fairly busy so they sat us in the back room the \"Bird's Nest\".  

We ordered the Spiced Maple Glazed Pork Jowl & Matchstix and Cheese Plate with Red Onion Jam & Walnut Toasts for starters.  The cheese plate was was fine but the pork jowl was a pass for me.  I shared the Slow Roast Lamb Shoulder with Curried Aioli (5/5) and Cep-Tarragon Risotto with Dry Cured Venison (4/5) for mains.  I washed all of this down with the 2014 Pinot Grigio, Luigi Righetti (4/5).  For me the Chocolate & Caramel Sponge Cake with Salted Ice Cream (5/5) with Graham's 20 Year Old Tawny Port was the hedonistic height of the evening.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Bring your McDonald's coupons because you're going to need them after a meal at the Wickson!  If you're here, it's probably because it is Monday or Tuesday night and nowhere else is open.  I'd forgo that homemade ketchup for a few more \"frites\", a steak that isn't snack-sized, or more tiny potats than I can count on one hand."}
{"text":"3.5 stars... I definitely think this is a great place for a first date brunch or meet up with friends.  The atmosphere is really nice and no one can say they ever left hungry.  For the atmosphere and value... it's almost unheard of in Toronto.  4 stars for the place but the food is where it's a bit spotty.

You can find Wickson within a few seconds of Yonge St.  It's in the first floor of a new building and Wickson takes full advantage of the space. Vaulted ceilings, big windows, and a great atmosphere unfolds as you walk in.  Yes it's unmistakably a bar but it's a really nice one... vibrant reds and gleaming warm woods are everywhere.  There are 2 side rooms which are very cool and allows for private dinners ... one is a blue room which probably can fit easily 12+ and there's a room on a lower 'above ground' alcove that has many tables and it's own bar.  That would be great space for a party.  Unlike most bars, there's definitely a modern hip edge and it's visible in the bold mural in the main room.

Service here is polite and careful ... I think for brunch, they had 3 focused staff with someone at the bar.  It wasn't as attentive or engaging as other places but nothing went amiss and we never had to wait tooo long.  Though I think the table beside us sat with a dirty table for a while before someone cleaned it up and place new clean cutlery down.

Potato Rosti with poached eggs & smoked salmon - Rosti is one of my comfort foods... whenever I am in Europe and just beat from the days travel, if there's Rosti on the menu, decision done pleasethxuverymuch. 
 With the poached eggs, smoke salmon, and goat cheese on top, this would seem to be a winner.  i think execution is what made this a miss... Rost was crispy and generous in portion but it arrived cold.  The 2 eggs werent quail sized thank goodness but they were done hard (yolk was 80% cooked through).  I think it maybe sat a little long before being served? I'm not sure. 3/5

Banoffee french toast - Another potential winner looking at the menu... french toast with caramelized bananas and toffee?  Sounds good.  When it arrived, it was another generous plate but the french toast was very heavy.  It wasn't the custard middle and crisp edges that makes us impressed.  The edges were soft... perhaps it wasn't seared high enough temp and soaked too long in the custard?  Also the flavour was ok... nothing jumped out as being very good.  3/5

Duck Fat Home Fries - Possibly best home fries we've had in Toronto.  Honestly.  We normally get a side dish of the fries and this one by far was one of the best one.  It arrived hot, crispy, with that great crunch on the crust and tossed with a lot of flavourful spices and seasoning that makes you want to order a 2nd bowl.  We asked for it to be extra crispy and this was just perfect.  5/5

If you want drinks and a few snacks... I think this would be a great spot.  The vibe and value is really rare to see in Toronto.  As for food quality, the brunch is a bit spotty... sure they showed a great home fries and large portions but not sure if I'd come back quickly to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"This is a fabulous hidden spot off from the busy Yonge Street. The owners of Oxley & Queen and beaver did it again. With stunning interior and great service! 
If you have a chance to be served by Olivia here, she's great! With a punch of great personality, helpfulness, great recommendations from the menu and care you'll be taken good care of during your visit here.
Amazing cocktails and I even love the red washroom with subtle lights that lights up the minute you step into the washroom. Kudos to having another great hangout place downtown."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday brunch, around noon. The place was deserted, so there was no problem getting a table and quick service.

The brunch menu is pretty standard (nothing too imaginative), but the food was good."}
{"text":"Yesterday we dined at The Wickson Social. It is a beautiful restaurant with a lovely ambience. The service is excellent. Unfortunately, we were not very impressed by the food. The dishes look wonderful, but in the end, some tasted odd and others were just bland. My son had the pork, which he liked. I had the squash bisque, which was good enough, but had an odd spice. I also had the chicken, which was tender, but pretty tasteless. My husband had the duck and the ham and celeriac remoulded, both also very bland. My daughter had the fish and chips, and my other son had the burger. Both dishes were good, but nothing special - things you could get at any pub. Although it is a beautiful place, and the service is very good, I don't think we will go back."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for brunch this morning as we both had heard great things about this new spot. We each ordered the scones with poached eggs, spinach, mushroom and hollandaise, the scones tasted amazing. I also decided to order the buttermilk pancakes with maple butter and a scoop of vanilla ice cream as recommended by the server - the pancakes were so fluffy and the maple butter and vanilla ice cream were a perfect combination. 

The only downfall for me was that they only serve drip coffee which I hope will change in the coming months! The food and service was great and I also loved the interior. Definitely will be back to try their dinner menu."}
{"text":"Love the Speakeasy Vibe of The Wickson Social. 

The sign is so small and you might just miss it in the dark. Walked in through this little door and you would be transport to a different world. A world that serves well crafted cocktails and tasty bar snacks.  A world that is stylish and sophisticated.

I just feel like I am all grown up.

Apple Pie Sour ($14) - dos, Egg White, Lemon, Apple, House-Made All Spice Syrup was just so delicious and with great presentation!

Will definitely drop by for cocktails again. Their food menu is changes seasonally. And if cocktails is not your thing, their crafted beer menu is quite impressive too!"}
{"text":"Love the food and the atmosphere. The staff is great. The food and cocktails are very good. They have a great interesting space. It is a little on the pricey side."}
{"text":"I cannot resist establishments with \"social\" in the name. It usually means you're in for some good cocktails, a decent wine list and creative small plates. The Wickson Social is no exception to this standard. I truly enjoyed my time here last night. 

I haven't been cocktail-minded as of late, though I spied a large chalkboard with enticing names and descriptions. Instead I went with a glass of Barbera d'Asti. I'm not a beer person, but my dining companions chose selections off the exceptional beer list.

The menu is well-curated, with an array of small, sharable plates, as well roughly a half dozen more hearty plates. Prices are lower than you'd expect in an American gastropub. My divine \"small\" massaged kale salad with dates and almonds at $8 really impressed! I'm still thinking about it, the velvety kale, smoky, crunchy nuts and sweet chewy dates (texture party!) It is perfect. And large. Seriously, large. I also ordered the grilled bread (SO GOOD) with warm, marinated Kalamata olives. Our waiter was very helpful in identifying vegan versions of things that aren't vegan on the menu (there are a couple things that are vegan). 

The Wickson Social is the perfect kind of place for nighttime libations and if, say, you arrive not hungry, you may find yourself there within a couple hours, so a variety of small plates and not- so- small plates awaits you! The room is cavernous and lends itself well to social gatherings of small groups (but feels intimate enough for a date). Do venture to the backroom, an almost delicious secret!"}
{"text":"My friends had suggested that we stop off at Wickson Social after out movie this afternoon.  

It turned out to be a fantastic idea!

I had taken a peek at the place the week before and was impressed with the decor and the bar. It was stocked with the very best of everything. 

We sat in the blue section near the front. Cute orbs for chandeliers. Great ambience. 

Our server had that knack to know the exact moments to show up and offer assistance. 

Drinks: We had a pomegranate cocktail, a rum-based Old Fashioned, and a Hendricks gin Martini. All tasted excellent. 

Appetizers: Cheese and Parsnip pops, Lightly battered Onion Rings, and a delicious Kale Salad. 

Mains: I had the Artichoke and Arugula flatbread. One friend had Tagliatelle, and the other friend had a pork main. 

Wine was Italian. 
Desert was chocolate. 

Overall experience was very good. 

If you have a chance, go check it out!!"}
{"text":"Booked The Wickson for a dinner to celebrate a couple of friends birthdays.

Atmosphere, food and service were all great.  Place wasn't to busy when we got there, but definitely picked up shortly after.  Probably a good idea to book a reservation to make sure you get a table.

Was eight of us so we did an assortment of apps to start, that we all shared.  Based on all the empty plates, think it is safe to assume everyone enjoyed the offering.  The mains were a collection of steak, lamb and salmon.  Again, not a single complaint, food was excellent!

As we were all pretty stuffed at this point we decided to share a couple desserts.  Definitely recommend trying the flourless chocolate cake, it was amazing.

First time trying this place for dinner and definitely will be returning."}
{"text":"Great place to go for local craft beers. Maybe the best selection of Ontario craft beers in the province. All there beers and ciders are local."}
{"text":"What a lovely place! It was hidden along a very quiet street but it was packed with people once we went inside. The decor is amazing and they have a cat mural! What's there not to love? 

The food was on point and they have curtains in the hall way to ensure new entrants that come in will not bring the cold air in as well. 

Now on to the food, it was delicious and very nice presentations. I did love every piece I ate and the price was amazing for winterlicious! I think the best part were their drink mixs and I can't wait to go back and try the different ones! I loved my dark and stormy which had a hint of sour. Definitely a place to try!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem along Yonge just 10 mins walk south of Yonge and Bloor! Went there once for drinks and the service was amazing, the vibe and decor is trendy and cool but has a lot of character, there are interesting drink combos and the server was happy to discuss them with you. We were there for a few hours and not once were our waters empty. They brought us a free Appie of figs with ricotta cheese drizzled with honey and pepper and that was delicious and I ordered an Appie to share of roasted shishito peppers with dill and yogurt sauce and some kind of pork fat that was a very interesting and yummy combo. Two colleagues I went with got the burgers and they liked them. Another colleague liked the place so much she booked it for a large group social gathering later on and everyone liked it there. Highly recommend."}
