{"text":"The service was decent, ordered a couple phillys which turned out to be unseasoned steak-ums. Between the 3 of us we ordered an order of cajun onion ring sides & 2 regular onion rings sides. Only 2 onion rings total had cajun seasoning, the others had no seasoning at all, not even salt. It was as if they completely forgot to add the flavor.   Try the chicken sandwich, it was decent size portion & cooked just right."}
{"text":"Food is subpar when you eventually get it. It's the little things too. Like having silverware when food hits the table is nice. And if we ask for something let's not say 'sure' then spend the next five minutes flipping channels and checking out whatever on your friend's phone.  Haven't been there for the Bar part, maybe that's what they are good at because it certainly isn't the grill."}
{"text":"We decided to try lunch at this grill and sports bar , a sister restaurant of the Drunken Goat in Fort Mill.  We were greeted by a friendly waitress. The restaurant has over a dozen wall tvs, high top tables and a few booths. Tables outside for those who may want to smoke. Menu of burgers, sandwiches, a few salads, sides like onion rings, Cajun and regular fries, wings with a great many sauces to name a few. We tried onion rings, they were good and crunchy, not greasy. We tried the wings with bourbon sauce, all good too. We both ordered the chefs special, chicken topped salad with either fried or grilled chicken breast, average salad with well seasoned chicken Food was plated nicely. Hot foods came out hot. Prices on par with the area. Atmosphere typical bar and grill, hard rock music in the background, decor of   browns and blacks,  large scuff marks on  parts of the floor which I couldn't help notice where I was sitting. Probably a good place for the bar and grill crowd. Time will tell."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money.  Mozzarella sticks 1/2 cooked and served with what appeared to be old tomato paste as a dip.  Chicken tenders straight from a Walmart bag, hamburger served on a stale inedible bun, burger itself just a grey patty with no grill/char marks at all, the draft beers that are listed for $3.00 on website, Facebook, and menu are $3.50.  Chicken wings were cooked properly but the sauce was awful. How is it possible to screw up bar food this badly?"}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is BOMB, service is as well! Joe is a hottie! I ordered carnitas tacos which were (what seemed) authentically seasoned and the perfect amount of messy - for tacos. I also had the SBB sushi roll which was an awesome twist on your typical roll. Nice outside area with corn hole AND live music! 5++"}
