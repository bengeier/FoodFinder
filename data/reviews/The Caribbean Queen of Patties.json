{"text":"I drive from scarbough to get patties.   Yes she is a character but her  personality shine after the 4 th years I been going there.   And she was squeezed out of her old location a few years back.  So with new location came higher rent we assume so prices had to go up.



Yes she is a one woman show and make the patties herself.    


Jerk chicken is only ok now but much better at the old location . I get a hot pattie  to eat and a box to go."}
{"text":"I used to go to this place all the time, back when it was across the street. I stopped going when one too many times I was given food that was clearly not fresh.
 
I think the woman who runs it is generally sweet, I went for years and she was always good natured...but then you hit her on a bad day and she's stupidly rude to you. She needs to hire someone to run the register. It could be argued she can't afford it, but she loses enough business (like mine) doing what she's doing to pay for an employee. I go all the way to Bloor and Dufferin to Jerk King because, after years, I got sick of the long waits, occasionally stale food, and the mood swings."}
{"text":"If you're indecisive maybe you shouldn't go here. There isn't much tolerance for tools so idiots should avoid this place too. Fact is these are probably the best patties in the city and the rest of the food doesn't fall short either. Yes the waits can be long but they are worth it. Who doesn't have 15 minutes to spare for some great food. Don't be an idiot and you will be able to enjoy some great cheap food."}
{"text":"I really like the owner, Georgie. She's got a no-nonsense type of temperament that reminds me of my aunt. But if you don't understand where she's coming from, you may easily be taken aback or even offended by her attitude. She's an older lady who runs the establishment all by herself and although Bloordale is a vibrant neighbourhood, it's also a place where you're guaranteed to serve people with a few screws loose once in a while. So I believe her sometimes abrasive attitude is a form of protection.

Despite this, if you're patient and give her a warm and genuine smile, you will eventually uncover her warmhearted nature. 

Indeed, she makes everything with love (and lots of flavour). There are 3 dishes you simply MUST try in no particular order: 

1. The jerk chicken sandwich. It's rare to find chicken breast that is so tender and flavourful. Its topped with a creamy coleslaw and served inside a delicious, soft bun. For some crunch, ask for a bag of spicy plantain chips.

2. The patties. Georgie certainly is the Queen of Patties. She's even won competitions (you'll see the news articles displayed proudly near the entrance). I find it refreshing that in a city where every corner shop is selling mass-produced, preservative-laced patties, you can still find authentic Jamaican patties made by an authentic Jamaican woman. And they're really, really tasty.

3. Oxtail with rice and peas. First off, the rice is decidedly average, but the oxtail makes up for it. Why? It's some of the most juicy, fall-off-the-bone, flavourful, hearty, sumptuous oxtail I've tasted."}

Recommended Dish: Ox Tail

Reviewed during: Mon - Fri Dinner time
Service Speed: 0 / 5 
Cooking speed: N/A (I think everything is cooked ahead of time)
Food Quality: 5 / 5
Food Quantity: 5 / 5
Price: 2 / 5 (approximately $15 for each large entree)
Repeat: Only if you are willing to wait.......

[Beef Patty]
I love the shell of the patty, it's very different than all the other ones I have tried.
But the beef filling was very saucy! Unfortunately it comes in mild only.

[Jerk Pork]
Jerk Pork was recommended by the person who recommended this restaurant.
The piece with fat attached is very delicious, otherwise the meat is a bit dry.

[Ox Tail]
The ox tail is very good and flavorful, and it must be cooked for a long time because the meat falls off the bones! It is definitely the top 3 Ox tail I have ever tasted.

[Curry Goat Roti]
I was not expecting the roti to fill up the whole foam container, and the roti is full of curry goat (which falls off the bones as well), my one compliant was it is not spicy enough.

I was surprised by the generous portion size for each dish, there is a lot of meat for each dish. The food is very good, but the long waiting time is a big issue, we were the first in line when we arrive, but it took the owner 25+ minutes to bring out/bag 3 patties and 3 entrees while she was talking with the telemarketer.

The price is almost 50% above Ritz, but it makes up for it with the taste and portion size. If you are willing to wait for your food, this will be a good place to order the food."}
{"text":"I have to write a review to combat all the negative that's being said about Georgina. I'm not sure what you expect from a one-lady-band (she is the only one there doing all of the cooking and the selling) but maybe, just maybe, if you treat people with kindness - they'll give you kindness in return.

My friend and I are always greeted with nothing but smiles and laughter. I share conversation with Georgina, I share laughs with her, and I walk away with THE BEST BEEF PATTIES THIS WORLD HAS TO OFFER.

Her prices have gone up but you know what? IT'S WORTH IT. No other beef patty in the city is comparable and I've tried them all. The pastry she uses is out of this world delicious and the meat filling is flavourful. A dozen patties will cost you $22 and I'll give her my money every time, no other patty will do!"}
{"text":"The food is great, and best coleslaw I've ever had. The reason why I give a low score is Georginas attitude needs adjusting. Sometimes she is nice and sweet, and other times a wretched old witch. I'll return again, but if I encounter another attitude, I will never return."}
{"text":"Took a taste couple days ago . . . place rocks!!!! As a white-boy (portuguese/itlaian) growing-up in the dufferin/eglinton area between two jamacian hoods . . . oakwood/eglingon - keele/eglington. Carribean Queen, hands-down best pattie joint south of eglington. Big, juicy, seaoned beef. Soft, sexy crust. Yum Yum. Very cool Island-Mama behind counter. Will be back."}
{"text":"The service can be a little slow but worth the wait. Best patties in the city."}
{"text":"The best veggie roti, hands down. The goat roti is delicious as well, well cooked and seasoned with very generous portions. Sad to see unfortunate reviews, maybe the quality fluctuates? 

Georgina is sweet. I think people have to understand that she is indeed running this place on her lonesome. She always makes sure I have extra cutlery and my food is well packed as I usually grab it to go. 

The patties are equally amazing and she does run out so make sure you get there early!"}
{"text":"I'm def a fan of the patties, and the cashew brittle.  The jerk Chicken was ok, but I would still eat here, maybe a curry chicken roti next time."}
{"text":"This place is not worth the drama.  The beef patty was pretty good but not much different from any other place.  Unfortunately mine fell apart to much but I still ate it.  BUT onto the meat of the review...

This woman is a jerk and after the way she treated me I'd rather eat at McDonald's.  I wasn't rude or pushy, nor did I ask annoying questions.  After about 40 minutes of her hiding in the back arguing on the phone while telling us \"it'll be ready in another 10 minutes\" I ended up waiting about 40 minutes and when she finally came out with my 2 beef patties she told me the money I was paying with was counterfeit.  I didn't know how to respond so another kind and patient customer looked at the money and assured her it was real money.  NO she says I DON'T WANT NO FAKE MONEY.   Do you have anything else cold to drink that's not soda?  NO!  What do you say to this kind of absurd person?   Whatever is happening to her in life that causes her to act like a donkey she needs to put it away when she's doing business.  Everyone has problems.  I'm sorry she's doing this solo but don't open if you can't handle doing business.   I waited patiently without complaining (trying to help a small business) even though her slow pace put me into rush hour traffic and she insults me over nothing.  I really truly hope she shuts down soon.  Looking at many similar sentiments on her old Yelp page she needs to learn some lessons.  And to all those annoying people who defend her antics, try being so big hearted after she treats you like crap."}

The Caribbean Patty Queen makes some of the best authentic Caribbean dishes in the city. Try the patties once, and you'll be taking home a box of 12 ($10.99) before you know it. Try a lunch special: usually some delicious stewed meat on rice for around $5. It's the Queen that makes this place so great, and the warm and friendly smile on her face that you've seen in newspapers over the years hasn't changed.
I understand that she might be moving locations soon, but I'll leave the review up here so everyone can stop in and grab lunch or a patty before she moves on.
(I would recommend the roti, but she's a few steps away from Vena's. Tough luck!)

 4 stars"}
{"text":"Best patties ever. The place itself leaves a lot to be desired and the lady that works there definitely doesn't have time for anyone's crap, but the patties make up for it.  $2.50 for a big and delicious patty.  They're even good reheated."}
{"text":"The patties are pretty good but not the best I've tasted like many others have said. The \"queen of patties\" is rude. My jerk chicken that I ordered was not chopped up properly so it did not taste \"jerk\" at all!! Barely any rice. Coleslaw was blah. I wasted my money and stomach it was a truly disappointing."}
{"text":"Very good, tasty spices in the patty and all my coworkers loved it.

Too bad she closed down :("}
{"text":"I came two days in a row while in Toronto. I had the pork and oxtail jerk and again goat and curry. They are all excellent and authentic. Quite hot but naturally. Goes well with their soda. The owner and cook is very warm person."}
{"text":"Went there a while back trying to get the jerk chicken special for lunch, 6 dollars so why not...
I read about the infamous rude lady that runs the store, but I told myself that if I were to walk in there all smiles she would treat me differently, wrong.
She proceeded to talk on the phone and take her sweet time to take my order, while giving me the most attitude I've ever seen. That's not even the worse part about it, I was charged 8.50 for her 6 dollar special.
Oh well whatever, it must be good food...
No, the chicken was dry and hard. 
Definitely not going back there, overpriced jerk chicken and a bitchy lady completely killed all the chances of me going back there.

I do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Bestttt Jamaican patties I've ever had in my life. Ox tail is to die for, same with the jerk chicken. I work close by so I get her patties at least 2-3 times a week. I have no idea what people are saying when it comes to her attitude, she's an absolute sweetheart and always makes sure she has everything I need to enjoy her delicious food. Props to this lovely lady for running an awesome restaurant all on her own!!"}
{"text":"Yes indeed this is the place.
The only place in Toronto to go for authentic HOME MADE patties!!  
Delicious and worth the wait."}
{"text":"Best in the city. 

I can't get behind anyone who doesn't like these. They're often great, and occasionally they are just mind boggling. 

Randys is great, but I like the queen better."}
{"text":"do not fuck with Georgina - she is the goddamn Caribbean Queen and she can be as salty to you as she pleases. do you not desire the spicy bounty of her years of honed experience? then deal with it. this is one instance where the concept of customer service is irrelevant. get your perfect beef patty and get outta my face."}
{"text":"Go for the patties, leave the jerk to others.   The owner is actually a sweet lady who just seems to only have one gear.  Never have I got the abuse others have mentioned in these reviews.  4 stars for the patties 2 for her jerk(just to inconsistent)."}
{"text":"Easily the best beef patties in the city.  Fresh, handmade and available in either mild or spicy (with vegetarian & chicken options available at times).

Be prepared to possibly wait for your patties - although the owner bakes a few times per day, each batch sells out quick (during busy times there can be a line waiting for each batch as they come out of the oven)."}
{"text":"The best patty in t.o, the lady makes these patties with pure soul, and you can feel it once the flavors reach your taste bud. Her attitude fluctuates from visit to visit, but hey if you're there strictly for food all is good."}
{"text":"This place seems to be inconsistent as my last visit wasn't all that positive in that the jerk pork was really dry and super super salty.  Georgina's prices don't seem to match what she has advertised on her chalkboards which is interesting.  I have no complaints about Georgina herself though as she's always been very pleasant with me (thank God!)."}
{"text":"BEST beef patties in the city!

It can be luck of the draw to make sure one gets there in time before she sells out but I try to stop by if I am in the area and see her open."}
{"text":"Finally I get there before she has sold out! Only beef is left but it's the best one for making comparisons. Hers avoid the usual pitfalls (greasiness, tough pastry,freezer burn,  mysterious lumps in the filling) and surpass all previous experiences with flavourfulness (is that a word? It seems the right one).

Don't come for atmosphere; this is no space for lingering and I was served while the proprietor talked on the phone to someone else. It was still more welcoming than many other take out spots in the city. Unpretentious; just good food at a good price point (currently, $2.00 per beef patty). Now my favorite take-out in Bloordale and a worthy member of its growing selection of interesting places to chow down."}
{"text":"You don't come to this place for the atmosphere or the customer service. Georgina, the Caribbean Queen of Patties, is an abrasive but lovely person who knows how to cook. I tried the jerk chicken sandwich, and took home half a dozen patties. Both were ridiculously good."}
{"text":"The pattys are delicious. Lots of meat compared to every other patty I've had. Flakey crust, a little sweet, a little spicey. Service can be slow, but it's worth the wait. I had the chicken roti which was a touch dry but I'll keep going back for my patty when ever I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Georgina has the best patties around- she'll joke that they are not jamaican patties- they are Canadian patties Jamaican style- me? They're Georgina's patties.

simply perfection. piping hot, fresh and delicious.  In a couple months she's going to be moving, but within the same building, I think.  Please please support the deliciousness at here and go give her a visit!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed reading the other reviews on yelp, I'm glad I'm not the only one who finds the 'Caribbean queen' rude and extremely terrifying! (she ripped the bill out of my hand one time,  she grew impatient waiting for me to get change out of my bag..)

Only giving her 3 stars though because her food has been inconsistent at times. One time the beef patty was TOO spicy, it left a burning sensation on my mouth. Other time, jerk chicken was burnt to a crisp. Then, another time, she ran out of jerk chicken on a Friday evening around 5 pm. We ordered the chicken roti instead.. the curry was watery and it was missing potatoes!

Conversation on the evening she ran out of jerk chicken:

BF: Could we get a large jerk chicken to go?
Her: *looks away* What if I told you..... there's NO more jerk chicken?
BF: Wha... what do you mean?

I don't know why she even asked such a hypothetical question, but looking back it was really funny how it all went down lol.

However, all that being said, when she does things right, the jerk chicken and beef patty are amazing! Maybe you gotta catch her on her good days..."}
{"text":"Even though customer service is non existent to most restaurant standards, and a lot of people are put off by it, but I didn't mind it at all.  I took extra effort to get along with the owner.  And she showed some signs of warmth most of the time.  She added character to the place and that character matched the neighbourhood.  

However, the inconsistency in food, is just too much.  The patties, when they are available (they weren't at the beginning of lunch on my last visit), are very tasty.  And out of the 20 times I have been there, 9 out of 10 times, consistent.  And when at their best, one of the better ones' I tasted in Canada (and Jamaica on my several trips there).  However, the other food, is a throw of the dice.  I have tasted the Goat, Oxtail and Jerk chicken on several occasions.  At it's best, they are delicious.  Juicy, full of flavour and very tender but, it was a 50/50 chance of getting this.  I find the rice, is always not that great to terrible.  Either cold to room temperature and way overcooked.  Sometimes you get rice and peas and sometimes you get just plain white rice, not sure why.  The white rice was always mushy/overcooked.  The slaw, terrible most of the time.  A lot of times, it's not slaw.  It's just dry, plain cabbage with nothing else.  Very little of it on the jerk special.  Now, at worst, you will get 3+ day old meat that's really dry, and tastes \"funny\" like I did a couple times including the last time I went.  Which was the deal breaker for me.  I understand that it's expensive to run a restaurant in Toronto, but freshness should not be sacrificed.  Consistency is the key to having a long standing restaurant.  She has great recipes, if only she could hire professinal help in the kitchen that would make food and service consistent, with a focus on freshness.  I think her place would flourish.  But as it is, unfortunately, i'm not coming back anymore.  There are much better options.  Tough for me to leave this review as I like the \"quirkiness\" of the owner and when food is fresh and not rushed, it's some of the better tasting Jamaican food in the city with extreme value."}
{"text":"Is the Patty spicy?  I asked the women as she passed the Patty to me.
The Patty is TASTY[sic].  As I take my Patty hesitantly as she replied.
She reconfirms me that it's a Beef Patty, as I would hate to find it Veg.

Beef Patty($1.50)

The Flaky Pastry had a Skydome(now Rogers Centre) Dome shape that gives it 3-dimensions rather than the 1-dimension flatness I've grown up on.  Maybe it's luck of the draw, who knows.  Not really spicy and somewhat mushy Meat filling inside."}
{"text":"I tried to pay with an immaculate roll of dimes (street value, $5) and she wouldn't accept the money.  She had the patty in her hand, saw the roll of dimes and said no.  She \"didn't want to count\" and had too many of those [coin rolls].\"  If you have so many coin rolls, you'll be off to the bank soon then right?! Nope. She let me walk the fudge out.  

So tired of worrying about being offended when I go to this place. Or waiting forEVER for her to come outta the back.  Next time you're in there, ask yourself this:  why doesn't it smell like food is being cooked?  I noticed that it NEVER smells like curry goat, oxtail, jerk chicken---all \"fresh\" foods that leave an intoxicating aroma when my family cooks em.  I could never go back there; not after that.  No patty is worth the stress.

Goodbye forever you bitter Betsy!

Oh, and I HAD quarters on me.  I didn't want you to have em Georgina.  Those are for laundry! hmmph!"}
{"text":"Owner *might not be super friendly (depending on the day) but its the BEST Jerk Pork you will ever have!"}
{"text":"Awesome patties for a great price!! Best pattie i've ever tried (mind you, i've only had patties at like 3 or 4 other places before and one was a school cafeteria). Can't wait to try the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the best places to get beef patties in the city. The lady who runs the shop makes them fresh several times a day by the looks of things. They are excellent. The shop sells other Jamacian food as well, though I haven't had any yet. There is no place to sit down and eat, the shop is strictly for take-out. Patties are a dollar each, or you can get 12 for 9 dollars."}
{"text":"Excellent homemade spiced beef patties with great pastry that you can eat without a chaser.  I also love the jerk pork - spicy, tender, with a good helping of rice and beans with side of coleslaw. The prices are great. Patties are a couple of bucks and the specials are $6. Tonight, I sampled her almond brittle and couldn't stop eating it -- incredible. I'm also fond of Georgina; she sometimes presents a prickly exterior but she's a softie... a little bit of charm/humour works with her. This isn't \"Have a Nice Day\" service, and it's oddly refreshing. Be prepared for fluctuating wait times. I know it feels like the antithesis of go-go-Toronto, but if you groove with it, it feels right."}
{"text":"Updating my review. Food is great and reasonably price but service can be erratic. I've been at least a dozen times and 90% of the time the service is great but I've had two instances where I've called to place a takeout order and she's given me the large instead of the small and required that I pay the price of the large. 
When you are ordering I would recommend you get her to repeat the order back to you."}
{"text":"Flaky crust and crumbles like short bread. Filling has actual bits of meat and accompanying sauce- slightly sweet and just a tad of spice. Reminds me of a beef stew packed in a patty."}
{"text":"Great Beef Patties --- yum!  
A bit spicy but not at all greasy and generous on the filling.
She has all kinds of roti for sale also.

She told me that she makes Black Cake around Christmas time -- I'll be back to check it out."}
{"text":"Only been once, but to get a bunch of Jamaican patties for the family... we've never had such good patties. The owner is a character... very nice."}
{"text":"rude rude and rude.

I went there with a friend on the weekend. The place was totally empty. A woman came out from the back and just stared at us. The conversation goes as follows:

Me: What's in your veggie roti?
Her: vegetables.
Me: Can you be more specific?
Her: .... silence accompanied by evil stare....awkward...
Me: Are there chick peas in it?
Her: Yes.
Me: I'll take the veggie roti.

She walks away...not taking my friends order. bizarre. later when he was able to catch a glimpse of her from the back he yelled out his order. she didn't respond...but we figured she'd heard him.

We sit and wait. 10 minutes later she yells out \"its here\". We go to get our food. I say we'd like to pay separately. She says \"separately\" and just stares at me. another awkward stare down moment.....and finally I say how much for this one. And she tells me. I pay her. 

After all this I have to say the food was just ok. not cheap and not that good. My veg roti was really watery and so mild; not at all what i'm used to. And I LOVE  channa/veg roti's. love, love love.  If you're going to treat me like crap and least give me some awesome food!!

Pluses: good music was playing .

Minuses: everything else."}
{"text":"If I could give it zero stars, I would. 
I came in, no one at the counter. I say, \"hello!\"  
In the distance I hear someone hollering back but no show for about 2 min. I'm not sure if I should yell out my order or wait for some eye contact. 
A lady comes out but not all the way. I had to lean over the counter to see her. I tell her my order. A jerk chicken sandwich. It's supposed to be $6 by the way. My $6 is laid out on the counter. She brings out my sandwich all wrapped up in tinfoil and tells me it's $8. WTF?! 
I'm hungry so I give her the damn $8. 
I open up the sandwich and its cold, soaked with grease and it was soggy. The coleslaw is falling out. 
I decided to take the top off and eat it like a pizza. 
It was still horrible. I finally decided to just eat most of the cold chicken and throw away the rest. 
I'm still hungry"}
{"text":"This unassuming little shop on Bloor between Dufferin and Lansdowne sells the most delicious beef patties that I have ever tasted. The pastry is flaky but moist and the filling is seasoned perfectly with just the right amount of spice to give the patties some zip but not be overpowering. I have never once encountered any gristle in the patties and they are not greasy or oily at all. I'm a healthy eater and two patties is more than enough to fill me up for lunch for a grand total of $3. This is one of the most incredible food values I've ever experienced. What's also worth mentioning is the delightful demeanour of the woman behind the counter. A beaming smile and kind word await anyone coming in to The Caribbean Queen."}
{"text":"Alright, I've eaten here enough to say the spice is based on her mood. But it's not the way you think. Happy day? Real Spicy. Angry day? No spice. I always get goat or oxtail. There are two places on Bloor to get nice and tender oxtail here and the other place. 
She is there the whole day, every day so if you find her talking on the phone or be slightly angry, just ask yourself- what would you do if you cooked all day, everyday (the full seven days a week)?
As for the patties, go there after 1pm or just before 9pm.
 Beef patties yum, veg- never had it. 
 The only reason why I'm not giving her five stars is that I do not like her plantains."}
{"text":"Best patties in the city without question. Don't expect fancy here just quality Caribbean food. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Amazing jerk chicken and fresh baked patties. The price is great you get what you eat for sure!  Georgina is a sweetheart and loves what she does and cook and it really shows in her food. I have this at least once a week when I had a long day at work."}
{"text":"Quite popular in the neighbourhood!  Authentic homecooking style food.  This is mostly a take out place though there is a really small seating area.  The goat is basically a pile of spicy meat wrapped in flat bread.  The Ox tail is also a lot of tender spicy meat, with lots of rice. The chicken curry is loaded with delicious veggies.  I get take out here a lot and for under $15, it usually makes two meals!"}
{"text":"I went in there with only a few bucks to my name and I was hungry I wanted a patty. 
It was 2.50, I gave her a twoonie, two dimes a nickle and a quarter.
She got mad at me and told me she didn't want my dimes that I had to use debit.
Literally yelled at me over giving her two dimes. 
She is not a nice woman. Don't go here."}
{"text":"The place looks nice.. and the lady is nice too, but I have experienced better Caribbean food in Toronto."}
