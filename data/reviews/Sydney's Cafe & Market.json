{"text":"On my way to Smash Burger I saw a sign for \"Legendary Empanadas\" and couldn't resist stopping by. The atmosphere of the restaraunt is cozy and welcoming, with comfortable couches around the walls. I was greeted by Jason, who kindly helped me make my empanada selection. I ended up choosing the Bulgogi Empanada, which Jason reccomended I try with the Hoissin BBQ Sauce. The empanada had a soft and chewey outside and had great flavor and tender bulgogi meat on the inside. The Hoissin BBQ sauce is a must, and complements the flavor of the empanada perfectly. Not only did Jason bring me napkins and ask how I liked my food, but also brought me an Atomic Coffee to try that he had told me about. The Atomic Coffee is an iced coffee that they cold brew for 14 hourswith different infusions and spices. It was definitely the best iced coffee I've ever tasted, and will blow anything you can get at Starbucks out of the water. I also had a Nutella Oreo empanada that Jason prepared for me. I'll let the name of the dessert speak for it's self. Most dessert empanadas are always hit or miss, and this one is definitely a hit.  After I was finished with my Empanadas and started typing this review, an employee here named Matt asked me if I wanted to try something new and I said sure! He then came out of the kitchen with two plastic cups and put lemonade into each one. He mixed one with Cardamine and the other with Cinnamon and Nutmeg. He told me that he'd been experimenting with these on his own and that they weren't on the menu. Both were exotic tasting and the Cinnamon and Nutmeg one had a great kick to it. I was very impressed, Matt made a lemonade that was originally great even better. I would definitely like to see his lemonade's on the menu one day. He and Zach then talked to me about Arizona and welcomed me to the valley.  The only thing that was better than the delicious empanadas and drinks was the friendly employee's and the amazing customer service.  I've definitely found my new hang out spot and will be coming back a frequently!"}
{"text":"Haven't tried the food, but I came in for a boba drink. As far as pricing, they Should take notes from other boba places. A dollar extra for boba in your drink? My drink came out to just over 7.00. no thank you!"}
{"text":"Stopped by today for the first time.  I order the 2 item combo with the Patio chicken and Paella chicken.  Both empanadas were very good. Two things I had a problem with... the combo comes with a side of coleslaw-which never made it into my to go bag.  The cashier convinced me to try it and I wish I could have.  When she was handing me my bag I noticed on the sign that the combo came with a drink, I asked her about it and she said it did and gave me a cup.  Shouldn't she had already known that? Luckily I saw it so at least I was only missing one thing instead of two! I will go back, I will just make sure to check my bag before I leave next time!"}
{"text":"Great food and great customer service! One sandwich didn't come out melted and they immediately took it back and gave us a new one. Really great people working here"}
{"text":"Empanadas were awesome!! Great flavors and spread. The soups were awesome...we had the tomato basil soup which was too good for a vegetarian soup. Even the other japanese soup available tasted very good. If you ask, they give you sample to taste as well. Servers were  very professional too. Overall loved the place"}
{"text":"Wonderful, friendly accommodating service plus some of the best empanadas you will find!!! The empanadas we tried were all very tasty -- crust was tender and light, filling was flavorful and well seasoned. Excited to try the many variations of savory and sweet empanadas that are all made right there in the restaurant. We were sampled some of the sorbet - light, fresh and fruity - perfect complement to the empanadas. This was our fist visit to Sydney's, but certainly will not be our last."}
{"text":"We were strolling around Tempe market place looking gir coffee and a bite to eat. Our tendency is to just say no to Starbucks,  so we found Sydneys Cafe. Andrew was super helpful,  the empanadas are delicious and the chimmichuri sauce fantastic. All making for a great morning. :-)"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place...it's one of the only quick bites on this side of the center. I wasn't greeted at the door and I had to say hello at the register to the young workers. I asked if I could add turkey into the Big Cheese Classic, but they said they did not have turkey. So I still went with a classic grilled cheese! (Can't go wrong, right? Wrong.)  First I saw him put lots of mayo on each bread which I thought was weird (and extra fattening). They brought it to me with just the Gouda and Swiss cheese. I asked where's the cheddar!? And the guy said he didn't realize it's made with all three cheeses (when the big menu is seen stated above where he's making it). They asked if I wanted cheddar (duh, and I'm not paying over $7 for nothing) and they added it into my already toasted sandwhich. So just more butter added making it tasting over burnt and greasy instead of making me a fresh one from their mistake. Definitely not coming back and will take the extra walk to Paradise Bakery."}
{"text":"This was the worst service I have ever experienced!  It took quite a few minutes of standing at the counter before being greeted, then the cashier was extremely distracted while taking our order.  She not only had us repeat our order 3 times, but still got it wrong when she read it back.  The whole time we were up there and while she was taking our order, there was hot food sitting on the counter waiting to go out.  The cashier started talking to another employee while we were there about who the order was supposed to go to and neither of them knew so it just sat there for even longer.  Our drinks, which were just okay, took a a couple of minutes to come out, which was fine.  We started getting concerned about our food order 15 minutes after we ordered when the same cashier came up to clarify what our order was and claimed there was a mix up in the tickets.  Right after, we heard her go behind the counter and yell out our order for the first time.  Even then there wasn't any rushing and it took about 10 additional minutes to receive our food which appeared to have only needed heating up.  When she finally brought over the order, some of the toppings and the bread on the sandwich had fallen off.  They have sauces sitting out on all of the tables which smell awful!!  You can smell them right when you walk through the door and the scents are so strong that it almost made me gag.  The food was decent.  However, I found it to be very over-priced for the serving size.  But with how awful the service was, there is no way I will ever be returning to this place."}
{"text":"Waited WEEKS for this place to open and when it finally did I was INCREDIBLY UNDERWHELMED! Food was bland, no flavor, empanadas were under cooked, service was slow and the servers/cashiers were unprofessional; un-tucked, messy-looking. The main chef asked how the food was, and when I gave him my honest opinion, he said he had traveled the world and knew traditional Argentinian Empanadas well, and he had never gotten anything but good reviews... so why ask my opinion if you're going to dismiss it? Never mind the fact that I ACTUALLY DO know traditional Argentinian food FIRST HAND, according to him, I don't know what I'm talking about. The ONLY thing I actually liked was the green chimichurri sauce, that's about it. They also serve tea, but even that was not good; It left much to desire. I make better tea at home and remember, tea is just hot water and tea leaves, so how can you get that wrong?!?!?!?! Needless to say I DO NOT endorse or recommend this place and will NEVER go back."}
{"text":"I thought the food was ok -- not great but ok. What got to me though was that their menu doesn't reflect what they offer. I had my heart set on the Peking Duck empanada but was told that their menu hadn't been updated \"in a long time\" and the duck empanada hasn't been offered for quite some time. I asked for a different empanada on the menu and was old that wasn't available either. I ordered another empanada, but I almost felt like the menu is a bait and switch tactic. Then I wanted to get the apple empanada for dessert. You guessed it. Although it was on the menu on the wall, it wasn't offered. The menu is a paper trifold so to me, there's no excuse for not keeping it more current."}
{"text":"Walking in I was expecting a Latin vibe but I was pleasently surprised to find a world map of flavor. Empanadas from Asia, India and Latin America and each with authentic fresh ingredients. A little pricey but you won't leave hungry after two or three of their signature Empanadas. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great food and really nice and friendly people. Must taste the empanadas. Paella's one is impressive."}
{"text":"Big round of applause for this YUMMY Café!  As soon as I stepped in, it was a very welcoming feeling, EXCELLENT customer service.  Wasn't sure what to expect with the menu never really tried food like that, but I'm now hooked ! But what topped the experience was the very nice young man behind the counter, ANDREW was his name! considering I've never been there before I was a little overwhelmed on deciding what to get off the menu.  Andrew was so so so helpful, gave me  tiny samples of the drinks, and went over everything with me on the menu. After a long day of stressful work it was nice to come to a place like this, his cheerful spirit was highly appreciated. I live 30 minutes away from this café, way worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Great empanadas and very friendly staff. We tried 6 different flavors including an Oreo Nutella dessert empanada...all were delicious! Only negative was the lemonade - a little bit of a disappointment...but would definitely go back again for the empanadas!"}
{"text":"I have secretly stalked Sydney's for a couple weeks now and garnered enough strength to finally enter and partake!  Amazing vegetarian options and so inexpensive!  The samosa empanada was my victim, the flavor and texture and deliciousness were Out of this world!  The dipping sauces: amazing! Can't wait to go back and try more delicious options!"}
{"text":"\"Personality\" comes to mind when I think about Sydney's.  While Tempe Marketplace has its share of ho-hum chain restaurants, there are very few indie, non-sterile places to head to.  That's where Sydney's quite unexpectedly enters the picture.  Honestly, you could take Sydney's and put it as a stand-alone in downtown Phoenix, Scottsdale, Dublin, Auckland, etc. and it would fit right in.  And the empanadas!  So good!  I had the Samosa to start (think of an incredibly tasty cannoli-like pastry). It was so good that I followed that up with the Patio Chicken, which turned out to be even better than the veggie Samosa.  And get this...the owner (Sydney) spends time there...and actually talks and befriends her patrons.  And she's genuine!  Sydney's is right next to B&N.  Highly recommended.  I'm going back today, in fact."}
{"text":"Great service. Only Family owned cafe & restaurant in tempw market place. Extremely friendly"}
{"text":"The Sorbetto here is really good. I'm also a fan of their smoothies, especially the Caribbean Smoothie. The atmosphere is modern and trendy, which is definitely a bonus, and the workers are extremely friendly. Definitely check them out."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this place. I love places that are unique and bring character to their environment. The staff is excellent and extremely friendly. On my first visit I opted for a small snack and I fell in love with the chocolate cake they serve. It's what brings me back each and every time!  My only complaint would be that they seem to rotate the cakes so they don't always have my favorite cake but other than that, this place is great!"}
{"text":"Just tried this place out randomly for the first time, this past week. This is an order-at-the-counter type of place, and when the staff saw me staring blankly at the (HUGE!) menu, they were sweet enough to give me a quick run down of their offerings. This place has a little bit of everything. Known for their empanadas (voted \"Best in the Valley 2014\" if I recall correctly), they also have some specialty sandwiches, salads, lots of teas, custom sodas, and a few different alcoholic drinks (sangria! Rejoice!). They had a cute variety of desserts as well- from dessert empanadas (nutella!), to sorbet and cookies. The entire staff was sociable, very polite and patient, and made great suggestions. I had the California empanada with their homemade slaw (which is vinegar based, not mayo based- a nice change of pace!). The food was inexpensive ($7 for that meal with a drink!), and the food was very good!! Excellent variety of empanadas, including vegetarian options (thank you!!). I tried a chocolate chip cookie for dessert, which basically made my life complete. The staff all seemed sincerely friendly- not like they were \"forced\" to be that way- they were all very laid-back, nice, and had a good sense of humor. I will be back, for sure- what a great find! 5 stars for a \"fast-food\" place!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, amazing food, and the nicest staff I've ever met. The owner personally came out and refilled our drinks and stopped to talk and answered all of our questions. I can't say enough nice things about this place.   Support this small business while enjoying some awesome food and drinks. You can't go wrong with that sort of combo!"}
{"text":"Really cool little place in Tempe Marketplace... All about the empanadas- and they are amazing!  Especially loved the dessert nutella empanada.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Not sure what the deal is, but just went there and they are closed up tight. No sign that they will reopen, or why they are closed."}
{"text":"What a cute, quaint, lil' place! Love Sydney's! The tequila grabbed my attention, but the empanadas kept me hanging out. Locally owned and operated. Come see, Lee!"}
{"text":"Located in Tempe Marketplace, cute little place, clean and trendy. Food was delicious!!! coffee was so so good. The employees were so friendly and very attentive to us. Price was a bit high for a cafe, but honestly I was happy to pay a high price for a delicious empanada, crust was so good. Well done! I would recommend it. We visited this place based on the reviews and it didn't disappoint ."}
{"text":"First time here, based on Yelp reviews. I was looking for something light and the Italian wedding soup perfectly hit the spot. It was excellently seasoned, delicious mini meatballs, definitely not too salty and not bland at all which can sometimes happen. I will definitely be back soon to try the empanadas! They looked delicious ~ both the savory and the sweet. Very friendly, helpful staff rounded out a great experience. Great location at Tempe Marketplace."}
{"text":"Sydney's is great, made a hungry traveler feel welcome.  Was greeted and served meal promptly.  Great place for a lite bite or \"Brinner\""}
{"text":"Great food! So flavorful without the grease! Great vegetarian choices but lots of great meat choices too. Owner is a Southwest Airlines employee so all Southwest employees get a discount!"}
{"text":"The Chicken Paella empanada was awesome - the pastry shell had amazing texture and the filling was delicious! I enjoyed the house chimichurri sauce, which enhanced the taste of the empanada.   Besides having a great tasting empanada, the service was really good. Come here for good service and food."}
{"text":"A nice surprise and change of pace from the typical \"What do you want\" / \"I don't care-whatever you want\" conversation that is the theme song of marriage. Good flavors for any palate, but be brave and choose an empanada path. You also cannot go wrong with a Cubano sandwich. If only for dessert...I repeat: empanada. Very Berry is much like berry pie and peach almond was more cobbleresque."}
{"text":"I don't think this place is deserving of the 4 stars that it has. Went in for lunch on a weekday around 11:30 and found the employees just sitting around doing nothing. We were the first customers of the day, but it seemed like they hadn't even bothered doing any kind of set-up until we ordered.  The cashier seemed to have no idea what she was doing. We watched the cook methodically heat a piece of chicken for a \"grilled\" chicken sandwich (Chipotle Chicken Club) in a toaster oven reminiscent of Subway. But at least Subway is fast - it took forever to get our food and it was not very good.  We were the only people in the place even when it hit peak lunch hour - only one other person came in and we watched her stand at the counter for 5 minutes because both the staff had gone into the backroom and didn't bother coming back out.  Perhaps this place is better during the weekend... but I won't be back."}
{"text":"Their food is delicious and customer service was awesome!! The manager recognized me and my wife coming in for the second time and he gave us a free dessert empanada. The cubano is authentic and delicious just like in Miami. Awesome spot you should check it out."}
{"text":"Great empanadas. Had the chicken and beef as well as a peach empanada for desert. Sooo good.  The staff there were all really friendly and easy to talk to. Will definetley be going back."}
{"text":"We went to Sydney's Cafe with some friends for lunch based on their recommendation. Each of us ordered a variety of Empenada Combos. For a little bit more than $10, the meals came with 2 Empendadas with a side (either their house coleslaw or chips) and a drink. They also had an option for 1 Empendada with a side and drink.  I had gotten the Patio Chicken and Zuri Chicken with chips; others at the table had ordered the Peking Duck, the Samosa, and the Paella. After sampling the other ones as well, I'd say that I liked the Patio Chicken the best followed by the Zuri Chicken. Was it worth the money? ... Debatable. While the Empenadas were tasty and enjoyable, I thought the price was a bit on the high side. I'd probably go back but only order the Empenadas a la carte, not as a meal."}
{"text":"Took 15 minutes to get a frozen drink. All she had to do was pull the lever on the machine."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and decided try something new.  Tired of all the normal chain restaurants.  Inside was a very bring and well air conditioned environment.  So nice to be out of the AZ heat.  The empanadas are amazing! Each one has its own flavor representing different regions of the world.  They aren't fried like traditional empanadas, they have a flakey croissant like crust that is perfect.  I had the Gaucho beef empanada and the Cucumber melon drink.  They also have sandwiches and salads.  Everything is made fresh and has a very gourmet taste to it.  The drinks really refresh you on a hot day.  Love the atmosphere too!  Not sure what the 2 negative reviews are all about because I had a great experience.  Skip the Starbucks and Corner Bakery and try this place out!    Good for drinks, snacks, dinner and dessert"}
{"text":"It was just ok. The duck empanada was definitely the best out of the 4 we tried. The dough is thick and not very flaky. The staff was nice but must have been new as she served us our dessert empanada cold. We tried the oreo Nutella one and ate only half because the filling was rock hard. The drinks were tasty though."}
{"text":"I discovered this place with a few co-workers last week and I've been almost every day since! It is a cute cafe feel with amazing, quality food! The empanadas are the best I've had. My favorite is the California, which happens to be vegetarian. They also serve wine and frozen cocktails! Staff is amazing. It's quick so if you're in a hurry you get grab food and run!"}
{"text":"Wonderful little place! I'm surprised more people don't know about it. All of their empanadas are delicious, particularly their zuri chicken and apple dulce. They also have fresh, locally made sorbetto, which I didn't even know was a thing but have fallen in love with it. The iced chai tea with boba is extremely addicting. On top of it all, the staff is incredibly welcoming and know all about everything on the surprisingly extensive menu. They will welcome you as soon as you enter and help you with the difficult decision making process you will have after seeing everything they have to offer. This is definitely one of my new favorite places to go at the end of the day."}
{"text":"Had the Rite Chicken Salad.  The chicken on the salad was very good and plentiful.  I've gotten away from eating salads based on iceberg lettuce, but this salad was very good.  I topped it with the Asian Sesame Dressing.  Raspberry tea was a good change from regular ice tea.  Not the most exotic salad that I've had but a good value for the money."}
{"text":"There isn't anything we have tried that isn't delicious! I can confidently recommend the Zuri Chicken, bulgogi beef, empanadas and the ham and cheese melt as well as the Dutch mushroom and carmelized onion cheese sandwich! I cannot forget the outstanding Oreo Nutella empanada- be ready to be wowed- it is rich and delicious!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this place and to grab a quick bite to eat and was really impressed!  Service was better than some of the 5 star restraunts I've been to! Very friendly and helpful staff.   Tried the duck empanada and green tea boba tea latte - delicious!  Would def try this new spot out."}
{"text":"The ambience in this new cafe is quite chill and good place to hangout during the Arizona heat.  The frozen hot chocolate is good but the chocolate flavor is rich and sweet - probably because of the vanilla bean. It's too rich and sweet for my taste - but definitely something to try. Last time I had a frozen hot chocolate was at Serendipity in Vegas next to Cesar's Palace. Good to did one locally :)  I guess something I should try next time around is the fruit juice blends. Perhaps next time!"}
{"text":"Best empanadas in Tempe. The yellow curry was my fav. The chef was very friendly so was the staff"}
{"text":"I'm normally pretty loquacious in my reviews. In this instance, it's not necessary. Best sandwiches in the Valley, hands down. Incredible."}
{"text":"I tried two of their empanadas and while they were good - not sure if I will frequent this place often since it wasn't as filling as I thought. Even still it's a nice cafe with a great atmosphere and the people that work here are lovely. The Zuri Chicken empanada was great and everything I had hoped for, however I would probably skip on upgrading to a full meal which includes a drink and chips/coleslaw. The Dulce De Leche which is one of the dessert empanadas was decent but overall I would rather have ordered another one of their main empanadas that they have to offer.  With all that said though this is probably one of the best eats in Tempe Marketplace. Their lemonade is quite good as well if you ever get around to trying it."}
{"text":"Came here on a beautiful sunny day for lunch.  This was a very unique cafe.  Empenadas were displayed clearly through the glass so you get to see exactly how it looks before you buy it.  The lemonade and tea was delicious and very fresh.  The empenanadas were heated up and quickly served to us within 5 minutes of sitting down.  Wonderful local cafe inside of the District at Tempe Marketplace!"}
{"text":"The empanadas were great, staff was very professional and greeted me as soon as I walked in. I tried the Frozen hot Chocolate and it was great! Definitely would recommend this place it is awesome especially if you are looking to try something new :)"}
{"text":"Very friendly atmosphere and what an awesome selection! Very reasonably priced considering the quality and variety. I was so happy to get a chai with boba :) the staff were very inviting and happy."}
{"text":"I came here on Monday as I got really hungry looking around at Barnes and Noble for my perfect holiday book! This place has a bit of every thing and didn't seem too unhealthy as these empanadas weren't greasy in the least. I got the chicken picnic and the coleslaw (which is soaked in ginger beer) and really enjoyed the two. I will say they were a little pricey as I'm used to really low prices for empanadas but I liked the location to be honest, as it isn't far from ASU and didn't leave me hungry!"}
{"text":"I have to say I am highly impressed with the customer service here! I've been here twice and both times the employees were eager to help and very friendly!!!  The food is really good if your looking for a small snack (I've only had the empanadas). They have a great beverage selection as well stocked with many different teas and boba!!   I will definitely be back! This is quickly becoming my favorite spot for a quick eat while shopping."}
{"text":"Cuban sandwich was great and wow the fruit smoothie!  definitely going back.."}
{"text":"Talk about GREAT customer service! This little place is located across from Barnes & Noble, inside the mall. We stopped here for a beverage and were not only invited back for free refills (iced tea and lemonade) but were also told if I wasn't pleased with some flavored popcorn I bought for a gift top bring it back for a full refund! Outstanding!"}
{"text":"The only reason I would give this place less than five stars is the price but the empanadas over rule that! Hands down the best empanadas in Arizona."}
{"text":"Sydney's is really good! I never knew I liked empanadas that much until I came here. I've tried the bulgogi beef, BBQ shredded pork, the paella chicken and the Oreo Nutella dessert empanada. They were all scrumptious and bursting with flavor! On the side, they have a cart with what I think are homemade sauces. My favorite is the hoisin bbq and this sauce goes great with the bulgogi beef. They have a variety of drinks such as sodas, coffee, teas, and they serve boba (regular or different flavors). Today, I tried the green milk tea with boba which was pretty good. I've tried one soup there, the pepper jack broccoli which was okay but not thick and creamy enough for my liking. Nevertheless, this place is great for a little snack while you stroll around Tempe marketplace. What I like most about Syndneys though is the service. Every employee I've encountered there were so nice, helpful, and so friendly. It's what keeps me coming back for more. I also love their cute old fashion travel/aviation/international theme as well."}
{"text":"I recommend the cubano and the thai tea. The only thing that would make it better is if was pressed! Everyone there is super nice...perfect luch spot!"}
{"text":"I LOVED my experience here! The staff was super friendly, knowledgeable and entertaining. The shop was clean and not crowded, plus the food was superb. My party and I enjoyed everything about this restaurant, especially the boba tea. If you're looking for a great bite with an awesome atmosphere - try them for sure!"}
{"text":"Cubano grilled sandwich was amazing. Just hot and gooey and wonderful. The pickle is as big as the sandwich so you get some perfectly in every bite. Also had the Tart Cherry Empanada for dessert. 10/10 will visit again."}
{"text":"WARNING: The cole slaw here is just pickled cabbage. I love cole slaw, but this was so astringent and bitter that I had to toss it after a couple of bites.  I had the Patio Chicken empanada, cole slaw, and lemonade. The empanada was OK with an edible crust and OK flavors in the filling. However, the lemonade was sickening sweet. My meal came to a little over $7 with tax. My daughter had a salad, she did not finish it and thought it was below average for the price. My son-in-law had a sandwich and chips (but they forgot to put the chips in with sandwich so my daughter had to walk back to the store once we were almost to the car). The bread on the sandwich did not hold up to the fillings and disintegrated part way through the sandwich leaving him with a handful of sandwich ingredients.  Service was dreadfully slow. Beverages were self serve. Limited indoor seating and a small outdoor seating area. The store is located in the awful Tempe Marketplace with its scary parking lots and brutal hikes in AZ heat and monsoon humidity to get to any of the stores."}
{"text":"Love the empanadas, both sweet and savory. Delicious selection. Employees are very friendly."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in the boba milk iced tea - it was mostly milk and I could not taste the tea. It should be made with a splash of milk, not a splash of tea. I threw it out. However, I was happy with the paella empanada. It was rich and simply yummy. I will be back to try more of their empanadas and their desserts."}
{"text":"Found this little gem at Tempe Market place.  Excellent sandwiches, empanadas, and teas.  Staff is friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Finally found a legit Argentine empanada.  Seriously, I lived in Argentina for a couple years and I have STRUGGLED to find a true argentine empanada since I got back to the states.  Stumbled upon Sydney's....and its legit.  I lived in Western Argentina and this empanada was right in line with what I would eat 3 days a week.  Right down to the chimichurri.  Mad props Syds!"}
{"text":"Place is a cute atmosphere to just hang out or even do some hw. The selection in smoothies and teas are not too great but they are okay. The salads are good and they give you a lot but they don't taste that great. A typical salad taste you buy from a gas station... But. Overall it is a good place to grab a quick bite or smoothie!"}
{"text":"From my experience as a 27 year flight attendant traveling the world on a major airliner, I have had better. But in Arizona there are not many options when it comes to filling your empanada yearning.   My friend and I stopped by for a quick snack to hold us over until dinner. I ordered the Gaucho. He ordered the Zuri. My Gaucho was tasty. But it was even better when I added some of the tableside chili spread on top of it. The texture of the meat in mine tasted as if it had been pureed, kinda pasty. My experience from empanadas in Boliva and Peru the ground beef is still crumbly. Also the pastry dough wasn't flaky. The dough reminded me a bit of pizza dough. It was good, though. However, I do prefer a flaky crust. The price was a big difference too. Over 4 bucks is a little steep for an empanada. In South America you can snag'em for a buck. But I understand the overhead of having a store at the Market Place. My friend who spends a lot of time in Argentina and Uruguay just said his was okay when I asked him how his was. I ordered an Arnold Palmer which was Delicious! Will I go back? Yes. Only if I am at Tempe Market Place. I wouldn't just go to make a special trip to Sydneys. But I would stop if I was nearby shopping again."}
{"text":"Staff is as friendly as it gets!  The Boba Tea is excellent! The Cuban is really great as well. The best drink I've had there is the frozen strawberry slushie. Its soooo ridiculously good in my opinion. Its a must order each time. Ask for a sample before you buy one just so you are sure. They will let you sample any drinks before purchasing one.  I'm a big fan of empanadas and while I love Sydney's I can only say the empanadas are \"fair\" at best. They are small and expensive! I also prefer the fried empanadas as well and these are baked so take my review of them with a grain of salt. The price is not right regardless, though.  Ray, the head chef, is super friendly and genuinely cares about the guests who come in to the restaurant. I go back often and always enjoy being instantly greeted by him. I look forward to trying more stuff here in the future and plan to return many times and often!"}
{"text":"Empanadas are always amazing no matter the time of day. Same goes for their desserts they make daily.  Decent beer and wine selection if you prefer that type of beverage for your meal.  Try the prickly pear tea!"}
{"text":"The sorbetto was amazing. There are four different flavors, and they taste amazing. Best of all, the sorbetto to is both gluten-free and dairy-free. The green tea is quite flavorful, the Caribbean smooth is is refreshing and lite and the chai tea latte is wonderful!    I'll be back to try the empanadas!"}
{"text":"Wonderful customer service! Great atmosphere, conducive to conversation or studying. Love the aviation theme!"}
{"text":"I was fairly disappointed with my recent visit.   I came in being extremely excited about trying the Peking Duck empanada, but alas, they had \"pulled that particular one out of their rotation.\"  That makes sense since duck is expensive, but I wish I knew that before coming in.   I ended up with the chicken paella and the bulgogi flavors. I've been to Spain, and I pretty much grew up on korean BBQ. Those did not even remotely remind me of the authentic cuisine I've had before.   Was it a good empanada? Sure. Is it worth the money and the hype? Not even close.  They've also just been sitting under heat lamps all day, and I can't imagine coming back."}
{"text":"Been here a few times since new ownership. It's a good restaurant. Very delicious food and drinks! However, I do miss the various tea's and boba drinks the last store carried. Overall, I do recommend this as a nice stop-in for lunch :)"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. My husband had the bulgogi beef and chicken paella. I had the California. My son had the hot dog. Food came out fast and We all left full and happy.   The staff was extremely friendly. They were patient with us while we looked over the menu and they checked on us multiple times.   The owner even blew up a beach ball and gave it to the kids on the splash pad while we were there. He made my son's day by giving him one, too, along with a high five.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Awesome concept, great empanadas, and friendly service. Knocked down One star because the staff seemed a little out of it. Great place though, will go back to try other stuff, maybe a handmade soda."}
{"text":"I just happened upon Sydney's Cafe & Market one Saturday night as I was strolling through the Tempe Marketplace looking for something to eat. I thought to myself, \"Whoa, that's different. I haven't had an empanada probably since I was a little boy.\" I gave it a try and now I'm now in love.   The empanadas come in a variety of exotic selections. My favorite so far is the Peking Duck followed by the Chicken Paella. You don't have to wait for them too long and they're served to you hot, so be careful with the first couple of bites. You'll need to let the inside air out a little bit. Sydney's piece de resistance are its empanadas, but they have a very large selection of other items, which as of the writing of this review I have yet to try. I'm really looking forward to their grilled sandwiches. They even serve sandwiches in multigrain bread! How cool is that?   The restaurant itself is a small space, but very quaint. I love the wooden wall on one end that you're greeted with as you first walk in, which represents the marketplace portion of the restaurant. The staff are wonderfully helpful and kind. The outside seating is nice were it not summer in the desert. I'm looking forward to many visits at Sydney's and wish them much success."}
{"text":"I had a work meeting and the people that we were meeting with brought us food from here. I had just a house salad, apple empanada, and homemade lemonade. The house salad felt like I was eating nothing. It was mostly just lettuce. Not much too it. The apple empanada was good just very bready. The lemonade was probably the best part. It was really good. My coworkers tried the Chicken Palleo or whatever its called and they also said it was very good just bready. One of my coworkers tried The Zen Veggie sandwhich. She said it was very good and she would totally go back. So it seems like their our good things on the menu. I would probably order again to try something else out."}
{"text":"I love this place! I love that it is not a chain restaurant, it's one of a kind & you can tell the chefs take pride in everything they serve!! The ambiance is very inviting and cool, it's decorated so cute-you feel like you're in some great city somewhere else besides Tempe. The staff are all very friendly and helpful!! I love this local business and hope that you go try it for yourself!! The menu has lots of yummy choices!!"}
{"text":"Staff was really nice, and the place is warm and clean. They have lots of varities of empanadas and a lot of dessert options."}
{"text":"If there's one thing I like, it's an empanada so when I heard about this place I immediately put it on my shortlist of places to check out.  My boyfriend and I went on a Saturday night. It was about 9pm and there was no one there. We walked in and the guy working the counter asked us if we'd been in before. We said no and expected to get a run down of their offerings. We did not get any information whatsoever. In fact, he just walked away from us at that point. Okay, weird. So we decided which empanadas we wanted to try and each ordered two.  They came out all 4 in one basket. Considering they also gave us forks and knifes I would think we'd get plates or something. Nope. So I asked for a second basket. I should note their \"baskets\" are weird. They are metal and do not have flat bottom so cutting your empanada is really awkward.    I got the paella chicken and the bulgogi beef. Both were pretty good but neither one really blew me away. I thought the dough could have been a little crispier and the fillings a little more flavorful. If I'd never had empanadas before I would have thought they were great but considering I've had better, even here in Phoenix, I can't say they were anything to write home about.  So not bad in a pinch but I wouldn't go out of my way to go back."}
{"text":"I love this place, chicken Zuri is amazing. Service is also good.  Their drinks are kinda expensive but they're really good. I also tried their deserts it was good not as good as their food tho. I wish if this place would have a coffee machine that would be perfect, all they have is a normal coffee."}
{"text":"Genuinely kind staff that cares about the individual needs of each customer. Our cashier suggested a combo that would allow us to save and enjoy a free drink, in addition to the discount for being a southwest flier. I had the California empanada, which has the perfect blend of spinach, mushrooms and ricotta. I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"The food is fantastic. The drinks are refreshing and original. Spoke with the chef. Very nice guy as were all of the employees. If you're at Market Place you really need to stop by here and try a few things. You'll be hooked!"}
{"text":"I was impressed with the service and in love with the grilled cheese but when the owner took time to come check on me and friends- I was wowed. She remembered my name and treated me like the only customer in the place... Something you just don't get at chain restaurants."}
{"text":"Dropped by after purchasing a Groupon deal and I'm sure glad we did! I ordered a Peking duck empinada which was very nice and tasty. The crust was perfect and buttery. My husband had their peach pie a la mode. Excellent! One of the best pies he's ever had! We also had to try their boba teas. Great flavor, not too sweet, and their boba's had that perfect chewy texture.  Their staff were all helpful and warm, and owner was so generous and kind she even offered my husband more ice cream. They made us feel like family! We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've been looking at and liking milk tea photos on Yelp for the last two days when my cousin and I found ourselves shopping at Tempe Marketplace and looking for a sweet and refreshing break.  (We'd skipped dessert at The Normal after having brunch there a couple of hours ago.)  We weren't familiar with TM, so we didn't know if there were even cafes here that served milk teas, but when we spotted Sydney's Cafe at a distance, I recalled reading about it on Yelp and so decided we should check it out.    It's cozy indoors, a little cramped, but felt more like a food stall/counter at a Whole Foods, or Sprout's-- Sydney's specializes in empanadas and milk teas.  It also offers frozen beverages, as well as black tea, passion fruit tea, and homemade lemonade.  If you check-in on Yelp, you get a free 20 oz. fountain beverage, which includes sodas, black/passion fruit teas, and lemonade.  My cousin was too embarrassed to use the coupon, so I went in and constructed an Arnold Palmer (part tea, part lemonade) for her, which she really enjoyed!  I also told her not to feel embarrassed about redeeming Yelp check-in coupons!    She was thinking of trying an empanada and a black milk tea, but she ended up only getting the tea. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sydneys-cafe-and-market-tempe?select=ILwNG0qBkIWwA83N8Z6MnA#ILwNG0qBkIWwA83N8Z6MnA  I wasn't hungry, but if she was going to try an empanada, then I was going to have a bite of the Dulce de Leche and apple, but Sydney's wasn't offering it today.  So, FYI, do not go by the menus posted (overhead blackboard, or menu flyers) if you're hungry for empanadas, but check out what Sydney's has on display.    These are accompanied by signs that list the components of the empanadas, so those with allergies can quickly ascertain if they're safe to eat.  All of the savory items contained something allergenic for me, so my waistline was safe that day, for Sydney had nothing I wanted, or could, try.  :)  The rep/cashier Emily (lovely name, and I told her so!) was kind enough to let me sample the green and the Thai milk teas, which I didn't care for, so I ordered a Frozen hot chocolate, made with Ghirardelli cocoa and vanilla bean powders. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sydneys-cafe-and-market-tempe?select=5Kj3-TxF09BSeta9eoYEPw#5Kj3-TxF09BSeta9eoYEPw  This was my first frozen hot chocolate, and I enjoyed the first few sips until all the liquid, with all the flavors, ran out at about the half-full point.  Compared to the black milk tea, sweetened with condensed milk, that my cousin let me taste, I prefer the tea!  It actually tasted like Thai iced tea, but not too sweet.  I think perhaps the sample versions needed to be poured over ice to make them more palatable, but since I found the one out of three milk teas board offerings that I like, I'll just stop in for a black milk tea should I ever find myself craving for one while shopping at Tempe Marketplace!   Tip:  Sydney's carries popping boba to add to frozen yogurt, but cousin and I do not recall seeing any froyo on display...  The popping boba flavors come in mango, pomegranate, and blackberry."}
{"text":"Poor customer service. Was given the wrong cupcake flavor ($4 cupcake) and when I called to let them know they gave me a flavor I don't like, they said there was nothing they could do. Said they tried calling three times and left a message but there were no missed calls or messages on my phone. They tried to blame it on the wrong cell phone number from GrubHub but gave me the correct number. Oh and the grub hub driver called without any issues. GrubHub also called to let me know they'd refund the money for the wrong item given. At least GrubHub knows customer service is important.   The food was only okay. The Samosa empanada was the only thing we really enjoyed. We were disappointed with the Cuban sandwich, the coleslaw was terrible, Turkey Ruben was better than the Cuban but not by much.  Due to subpar food and extremely bad customer service, we will not be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Buckle Up! Adventure Calls. I love airline theme businesses, so I had to give them five stars. Owned by a Southwest Airlines flight attendant, he or she did a great job with the design.  I had dinner here with my friend Jeran and tried the Flying High Sandwich while my friend ordered an adult beverage. They were decent, but  I love the aviation decor complete with real airline beverage carts and trash cans. Service was also great, so I don't have any major criticism. The next time I come here, I hope to try the other Empanadas. Would I recommend this place? Yes!  I think it's a fun stop over  before catching a movie at the Tempe Marketplace.   Don't delay.... Go today!"}
{"text":"Thank you Lee (business owner of Sydney's) for welcoming our dogs and for your awesome food and drinks. I highly recommend Sydney's Cafe & Market"}
{"text":"Empanadas, bubble tea, and desserts? Wow what a combo! I love the idea but unfortunately the execution leaves much to be desired. I think they might be trying to accomplish too many things and as a result while they have a lot of variety they don't succeed in focusing on creating an ideal product.   I came here for lunch and decided on the #1 combination ($6.75) which comes with 1 empanada of your choice, a side, and a drink. Note that the fountain drinks are either iced tea (Black or raspberry today), or lemonade. Sodas are by the can. The empanada case had a variety of flavors such as gaucho beef, chorizo, and samosa (Which isn't really a flavor per se and I get what they are trying to convey, but it's kind of like saying your flavor is \"wonton\" or \"eggroll\"). I went for the paella chicken empanada, enticed by the description of savory chicken, red bell peppers, and saffron infused flavors. Your sides are tortilla chips, kettle chips, or coleslaw. I went for the coleslaw.  Since the empanadas were already made, it took no time to heat it up and get my side plated. Seating is nice and comfortable with chairs and padded (Leather? Leather-like?) booths.   The empanada dough is not as flaky as Republica Empanada's, and the filling was overly salty for me. There weren't enough textures to add variety to the filling either and I could only discern the stringy chicken texture and the mushy background texture. In terms of flavor, I could definitely taste the saffron, but the salt tended to overpower any other flavors the paella might have had. In addition, I got a small piece of chicken bone in my empanada- not good eats!  The coleslaw, on the other hand, looked beautiful with a sprinkling of black sesame seeds to contrast with the dressed lettuce, but tasted bland to me. I could only taste a very faint flavor of sweetness and vinegar.   I wolfed down my combination meal but was still hungry. If you are going for a full meal I would go for the larger combination #2 which includes 2 empanadas, drink, and side for a little less than $10.  If I'm in the area I might stop by again to try a bubble tea but overall I wasn't overly impressed with the empanadas or coleslaw."}
{"text":"Sydney's is FANTASTIC! The two staff members I spoke to (one looked like a manager) were welcoming and friendly. My boyfriend and I had the Chicken Paella empanada, BBQ empanada and the Flying Chicken Chipotle club. The sauce for the club was so delicious, the empanadas were flavorful, everything really blew me away.  It was really refreshing eating something so original instead of the same old thing. Amazing."}
{"text":"I think this is a notch over Republica empanada.  We've had the patio chicken empanada,  the gaucho, a Korean bbq empanada, and the favorite was the patio chicken.  The chimichurri sauce was minty and fresh. Service was excellent and the staff very friendly. One of my favorite things are the fact the empanadas ate baked,  not deep fried.  We enjoy sitting on the patio and watching the kids play in the fountains."}
{"text":"Sydney's Cafe is a little gem located right across from Barnes & Nobles in Tempe Market Place. it's at the end of the mall area strip but that doesn't mean it's all bad. It's a hidden gem, you go in nice art and table set up. The menu is a bit confusing just because there is a lot they throw at you and categorized. Other than that they are very well known for their empanadas, they specialize in different countries from all around the world, South America to Asia for example. They also cater and make their sandwiches and salads made to order! I had the 3 special ones I was a bit disappointed they did not have the bulgogi (Korean) empanada! I love Korean food!! But other than that it was very fast service was helpful! And make sure if you want to add some spice in your life try the special concoction I forgot the name tho it's a spicy and original sauce that they have! But if I were you I'd check them out they got the drinks and lots of goodies !"}
{"text":"They have TO DIE FOR empanadas. I tried the chicken paella (a Spanish classic) and bulgogi beef (famous Korean barbecue). Both were excellent.  The ingredients taste very flavorful and the crust is buttery and soft. All of their employees are very friendly.  I asked for a recommendation on a drink and I was told to go with hibiscus lemonade, which is a blend of hibiscus tea and lemonade.  It was pretty amazing and very refreshing! Even when my friend and I sat down, since it was our first time, we were explained what the two dipping sauces were at the table.  Later, we were checked on to see how everything was and then our baskets were taken from our table like a full-service sit down place. I was very impressed with the food, the service, and the restaurant overall. I will definitely be back. Keep up the great work!!!"}
{"text":"Having recently traveled to Puerto Rico, my fiancee and I have been craving empanadas something fierce ever since we got back. We've tried a few places around town - from the East Valley to the West as well as North. We've experienced a good array of quality and variation. I would place Sydney's (with regard to their empanadas) as \"fancy\" as opposed to \"traditional\" (based on my limited experience).   I had an empanada and a Chipotle Chicken Club Sandwich. The sandwich was bonkers. The chicken was super tender and flavorful, and I enjoyed their sauce. I also ordered a desert empanada... oreo nutella... it was also insane. Loved it. Molly had a couple of empanadas - veggie and chicken, and a mango coconut dessert one. She was in heaven.   The staff was exceptionally nice, and the place was clean and well designed. It is the first one of its kind, but you can just tell they plan to make many more of them. It's a great concept, and if they keep service outstanding food like this, with top level service, they will make more.  This spot used to be the home of a nice little tea and sandwich joint which also had nice employees and good food. While I liked that place, I'm truly excited for this one, and it's definitely going to be a place I visit often and which I would recommend to friends from out of town."}
{"text":"This place has serious potential but...they were out of lettuce which meant that you couldn't order a salad.  They were out of their soup offering and waiting for a new batch to be made, which was a different of kind of soup than what they had posted.    We went here for lunch on a Monday at 11:30 AM.  It felt like they were unprepared for the lunch crowd.    I did have the Samosa empanada which was very good.  I would go here again, with the hope that I could actually try what I want from their menu."}
{"text":"This a great place! My friend and I met up here for some girl time and it had the perfect atmosphere. Not too loud or distractingly fast paced. I noticed a lot of students who would come in for either private studying or group projects. The food is so interesting as well. Lots of great offerings that are internationally inspired. I had a delightful cup of blueberry tea and a delicious peaches and cream stuffed empanada. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Great food.  I had the Indian Samosa empenada w/slaw.  Delicious and ver authentic flavors.  Not normally a fan of slaw but Sydneys was wonderful with a crisp, fresh taste.  My 10-year old had a grilled cheese w/chips and lemonade.  She loved the sandwich and the chips. Brought her lemonade home to dad to taste because it was so good.  I also tried the iced chai latte.  Definitely one of the best I have had.  People working there were friendly, helpful, and asked if we liked the food.  Very attentive.  Atmosphere was laid-back with interesting decorations.  Very clean. Will be back soon and I will send my friends & family there!"}
{"text":"Awesome place!   Empanadas are great and the staff are awesome.  Sit back, relax and enjoy a margarita on the patio while the kids play in the splash zone."}
{"text":"This review is based only on their drinks. Have not tried the food yet.  Wanted to try this place out after Tea Infusion closed down. Went in today wanting an refreshing iced tea. Problem is the way they make you an iced tea is by giving you a hot cup of tea with a bag and then a cup of ice. THIS IS NOT HOW YOU MAKE AN ICED TEA!!! Did the ownership not take notes when Tea Infusion was still there? I also ordered an iced chai latte. Also poorly made! The old chai lattes were smooth, sweet and creamy. The one I had today was watered down, chalky and luke warm.   Needless to say if they can't get the simplest tea making down I'm scared to try the food.  And where did all the former staff go?! Miss their friendly faces..."}
{"text":"Fair. Almost no vegan options although the guy made me a custom vegan sandwhich that I was grateful for.  If they carry at least one vegan empanada, I will be back."}
{"text":"Yeah, no.  Placed order for turkey rueben at 1:38p. Ready at 1:58p.  Twenty minutes to make a sandwich is ridiculous. This was not a busy time for them.  The sandwich was OK, not great. I walked about two minutes from this restaurant to my office and the bread was already soggy. Not a very large sandwich for $8.49  They would only accept my Yelp coupon for a grilled cheese even though I spent more money. Whatever. Maybe that's a Yelp thing.   I won't return but maybe you'll have better luck."}
{"text":"The place looks nice, it smells good when I walk in...you can smell the butter and baking. But don't don't don't get the boba tea here, its almost $7 and it tastes terrible."}
{"text":"Since I introduced my little niece to Boba -bubble tea we have made it our after school Friday treat. Our favorite is the green tea boba -nothing fancy. This is the closest spot from Old Town when I was searching for places. Our usual haunt is The Street in Mesa -always on point and we have also been to the boba tea place in Chandler -which was good too.  So when we walked in the place was empty with one customer already putting in her drink order. I ordered the jr. grilled cheese, the green tea milk boba, a samosa empanada -with my yelp check in I got a free 20oz fountain drink. The cashier/food heater-upper didn't know how the coupon worked and seemed frazzled while putting in my order -I had to repeat myself a few times. No big deal but I hope he got it right. A line started to form. He gave me my total $17! But things didn't seem to add up. More people walking in. So I just signed the receipt and found a seat - my first mistake. Second mistake was sitting in the full bright sun -we moved back inside -they do have a cozy little patio area. Third mistake -getting the fountain drink -iced tea tasted old but I was thirsty -should have settled with water.  We waited close to 10 minutes when the cashier/food dude came up to us asking what we were waiting for. What are we waiting for? Don't you have a list of orders and I believe everyone that ordered behind me just had drinks! We got our food a few minutes later. Fourth mistake -the empanada was small -not much flavor or filling mostly the \"pastry\" outer shell and barely luke warm. Fifth mistake- the grilled cheese -the regular size grilled cheese -when I asked for the junior one -this is why it was so expensive. It was covered in kettle chips which she enjoyed more than the actual sandwich. I tasted it and the cheese smelled weird and that's why she didn't like it. It was pathetic for close to $8. A Sonic drive thru grilled cheese is better than this thing. My niece enjoyed the tea I was not a fan. Too much milk not enough boba.  It's a nice place with cool design and atmosphere but when it comes to the food and drink it's a miss for me. I wanted to like it so much too."}
{"text":"I am really glad Sydney's came to Tempe Marketplace.  I tried the Oreo/Nutella empanada with whipped cream.  It had lots of yummy filling, not overly doughy like some empanadas can be.  The current check-in offer allowed me to try their fresh homemade lemonade.  Yum!  Service was good too.  The staff is friendly and doting.  Great place!  Keep it up!"}
{"text":"I'm one of those people who complain Arizona does not have good food compared to California (ie. OC and San Fran area), and I'm not easily impressed with food in general...but WOW, Sydney's Cafe empanadas are so YUMMY! Actually, these are my first time trying any \"empanadas\" and now I'm a huge fan! I've tried the Bulgogi, Chicken Paella, and Samosa, and each one was full of flavors and seasoned perfectly. My fav has got to be the Samosa...it's like my grandma's Asian curry stew in a little compact pie! Ah, my mouth is watering just thinking about it! I wish I can eat there every day for lunch (but one empanada is like a snack size...cost $3.95. One does not fill you up). The high cost for the small size is my only complaint. But I will continue to come any chance I have and splurge...since there's really nothing better I've tasted in the Valley! Sydney's Cafe, you're my #1 favorite splurge lunch/snack stop now! Also, the various options of teas and milk teas are fun!"}
{"text":"I only got a drink with boba here, so that is all I'm reviewing.  On the plus side, they have non-dairy alternatives to milk (soy milk) so that the milk teas can be made for those who are lactose-intolerant.  Sadly, the Thai tea cannot be made lactose-intolerant friendly bc the condensed milk is already pre-mixed.  On the down side, I got the green tea milk tea and I did not enjoy the flavor.  It was super flowery, not what I was expecting for green tea.  Also my green tea was yellow...?  Not sure what was up with that... It was nice that they gave me a LOT of boba.  Buuut the boba was semi-tough and not as soft and chewy as I would have liked.  I might give them another try.  Maybe their boba just wasn't very fresh that day and maybe their other drink flavors are better.  Also I spotted some empanadas that looked pretty tasty - like the Veggie samosa empanada!"}
{"text":"Have been twice. First time was an evening visit with a guest. We got a couple empanadas and did some sharing. \"Peking\" Duck, \"Bulgogi\" Beef (x2), and \"Samosa\" Veggie. Bulgogi Beef was nothing special but the Peking Duck was pretty tasty, as was the Samosa. Nothing mind-blowing, but good food. Had a delicious Thai Iced Tea to wash it down. Decided to try out their desserts as well, something I don't normally do, and therein lies my mistake.  Ordered the Oreo/Chocolate Empanada and the Pumpkin Empanada (seasonal, I would assume) and we didn't like either. I didn't try the Pumpkin so I can't comment on that but I did try the chocolate empanada and it was awful. No exaggeration, just awful. The center was not melted, or soft, or anything you would presume from ordering a chocolate empanada. It was filled with a tough chocolate paste of some kind (very gruff, unpleasant texture in your mouth) with broken bits of Oreo cemented within. Most of it ended up in the trash.  Came back another day and asked about the dessert I got. \"Is it usually supposed to be melted or warm in the center?\" The woman working let me know that it is *supposed* to be. When I described what I had experienced to her, she couldn't believe it. I had been served a dessert that hadn't been cooked or prepared in any way. She offered me a freebie, which I appreciate, but my second trip was a lunch run and I don't really do daytime dessert. Perhaps the younger guy who served it to me was new?  Anyway, second trip was a lunch run that consisted of two sandwiches and a couple empanadas (\"Patio\" Chicken and Chicken Paella). The empanadas were tasty enough but one of the sandwiches was a Cubano and they apparently ran out of the bread they use for Cubano, so they substituted. That's forgivable, but they didn't toast or 'press' the sandwich like it was a Cubano and the result was a soft/soggy bun that greatly diminishes the Cubano sandwich experience.  I work nearby so I thought I timed the order correctly but I arrived when they told me to and it was another 10-15 minutes before I left with my food. Something to keep in mind if you've got limited time... I didn't really mind because I figured the extra time would give me a chance to get another Thai Iced Tea but learned (only after paying) that they were out of the ingredients to make it. I was offered a Green Milk Tea or something similar but didn't feel like chancing it with something I've never tried, so I acquiesced for a regular Green Tea. This is cheaper than the Thai Iced Tea but there was no refund or partial refund discussed. I would like to believe they'll give me a free Thai Iced Tea next time I stroll in but who knows. The regular green tea that I asked for didn't taste like regular green tea, pretty sure they gave me the green tea with some sort of berry or fruit flavor involved. Meh.  When they are on their A game, I imagine this is a pretty good place. Points off for uncooked dessert (\"gross\" doesn't cover what my mouth experienced), long wait for food, soggy Cubano, wrong tea, and not being aware of what's in stock before letting people pay. It's very possible that I just had a really unlucky run (within a couple days of each other) so I am more than willing to try again. Staff is friendly enough. So here's to hoping their ingredients arrive, they get a better review and I finally get some Thai Iced Tea."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place for a quick lunch. It is obviously convenient because of the Tempe Marketplace location. My friend and I stopped here because I was hungry. The service was fine but  I think it was way over priced for a non sit down restaurant. I ordered the caesar salad because it was very fairly prices but I was def not impressed. The salad was literally lettuce (some pieces not so crunchy), cheese and croutons. It was one of the most boring salads I have ever had. I could have made it more tasty at home for much less money. Also, the dressing was very tart or bitter or something very strong almost metallic tasting.   The reason for my 3 stars is that I might go back here and give something else a chance because it is cute and the employees are nice."}
{"text":"The Taro tea with boba is my current obsession! I come here once a week because I can't get enough of it. The place is cool it's sort of hidden in Tempe Marketplace. They serve food as well and there's a whole bunch of empanadas on display when you walk in. I will try the food one day but for now, all I want is my Taro tea!"}
{"text":"Boba, empandas, slushies, grilled cheese, beer, malbec, pinot grigio - Oh My!   This place has a little of everything, and it's independently owned! Please frequent this place folks. It's a gem and the staff is amazing! The owners take pride in what they do and will suggest items to you.   We came here wanting dessert... and we're thoroughly impressed with the various offerings. They also have a house slaw that appears to be amazing.   I also noticed Honest Kids lemonade and Inca Cola. These folks gave excellent taste."}
{"text":"Bomb empanadas!! Im glad I found this place so that when my mom doesn't want to make any, ill satisfy my craving here!"}
{"text":"VERY overpriced.  My husband's coffee was truly atrocious, and I paid more than five bucks for a green milk tea that was extremely watered down and had a pathetic amount of boba in it.  Maybe the food is good?  Other reviews are decent, so I wonder if maybe we just had a terrible barista.  At $8 for two crappy drinks, though, it's not worth coming back to find out."}
{"text":"**THIS IS ASU COUNTRY** (said in my radio announcer's voice).  I don't usually venture to this side of the tracks.  Normally I'm on the other side hanging out at Total Wine and More or Michaels. But the area over here is so quaint and inviting.  I had a restaurant.com coupon from my job to try this place out.  It is so cute and at the same time a little hipster.  The empanadas, forgetaboutit,  delicious, and fresh! I am going to dieters hell for eating the Nutella empanada doused with an ample amount of whipped cream,  but it is well worth the trip! The staff was knowledgeable and very patient with us first timers.  I will definitely return!"}
