{"text":"Average food. The eating area was freezing, we ate with our coats on. won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I went here after reading a good review of Chili's but finding a long wait on a Sunday night. Most eateries in this area close Sunday.  This place was empty. I soon found out why. Uninspired service, mediocre food for starters.   I had a burger well done (\"Gas House\") after they refused to cook it medium rare and assured me it wouldnt be dry. it was.   The fried pickles looked good, but the order never got put in. ANother waiter saw me with an empty glass and rescued the helpless lass who was trying to wait on me.  Not much good I can say about it except when they fixed the check for the blunders dinner was $17 with 2 drinks."}
{"text":"This used to be a Fuel Pizza location according to the server and are still owned by the same folks. That's right they have servers which is one of the differences. They provide more 'full service' to keep with their gas station theme.  It gives it an actual restaurant feel to it since you don't have to serve yourself which didn't really bother me and just adds to the cost with a tip. They also had a full bar with $3 well drinks and $1.75 Yuengling bottles on Tuesday night.    As far as i could tell they offered the same pizza and wings, but may have had some additional things on the menu. Although, they only had a 10 inch or a 14 inch pizza that i saw. We got the Whole Engine (something like green pepper, mushroom, pepperoni, sausage..) and the buffalo hot wings. Probably could have tried the inferno because the hot seemed kind of mild."}
{"text":"Well, stopping in for dinner turned into stopping in for a drink as the menu was scarce for veggie friendly options.  Scarce=non existent.  So, we took a chilis detour! Thank goodness for connected shoppin centers.  However, for those interested, the place has got the game on with lots of tvs available and it definitely has a great venue for chilling out with folks, having some dranks, and watching some sports.  The menu is bar foods, like wings and such!  So enjoy!"}
{"text":"I ate lunch here only because it was where my client, and half of their office, wanted to go.  The fried pickle chips were good, and service didn't keep us waiting too long.  The burger that I ordered medium was virtually incinerated and inedible.  I had trouble leaving a burger with only one bite taken, when the client was paying the tab.  I managed to choke it down, although it wasn't easy.  Having paid my dues I now get the opportunity to share with you just how miserable the Gas House Grill is.  Yes, payback is all that it is said to be."}
