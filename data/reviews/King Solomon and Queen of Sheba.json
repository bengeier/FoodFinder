{"text":"A great addition to the neighbourhood in the large space that was previously Magic Oven. We ordered the vegetarian platter and King Solomon Queen Sheba platter to try the assortment. It was beautiful plated and perfectly portioned for a ravenous appetite. The open front windows are great for people watching as well, and we'll be back as regulars for sure!"}
{"text":"Newly opened, but fantastic food, with very attentive and quick service.  The beef was so tender and the vegetarian platter delicious!  Will come back!"}
{"text":"The ambiance is what you would expect in this neighbourhood and for most Ethiopian restaurants. The food was great. Service was reasonable. We did the vegetarian platter which is really the only vegetarian option. Lots more meat options. TV with sports going. Hopefully this place survives."}
{"text":"Good food, but no gursha, which is great, too! While staying at the Westin's Harbour Front in TO, sick of the overpriced?, truly mediocre food there, we felt we'd earned something amazing, and Ethiopian/Eritrean food fits that bill! Full disclosure: we have it whenever and wherever we can; we make it at home ourselves, too--I'm getting pretty adept at making my version of wot and tibs. We picked this place because it was a healthy 20-30 minute walk from the hotel, which was just enough to really work? up an appetite, and we knew the walk back would provide a nice caloric burn after what we were hoping would be? a feast! It was...the ingredients were fresh, the flavours? rich, spicey, and intense, just the way we like it. It was also served hot, which is important? (apart from the kitfo--their version of tartare--and the salad) because? we've been to, thankfully?, a minority of places (usually the \"chain\" versions) that microwave their dishes, and it's not good. This wasn't the case here. I think what we enjoyed the most is that it lived up to our expectations but with a twist: the beef tasted \"beefier\" and the strips of beef had a glaze to it, and the berbere (for this dish only, chu chu I think?) was served on the side as a dipping sauce, which was very different for us. We've never dipped in an Ethiopian restaurant, but it was a nice twist, and I enjoyed the new combinations of flavours. 

They didn't have one of our go-to dishes zilzil (it was on the menu but unavailable? that evening), so they offered a substitute? (the chu chu?) I described? above, so I can't judge as I'd normally judge, but overall this was a solidly good experience with good food, and, as we've come to expect, wonderful and friendly staff who always make you feel like you've simply arrived as invited guests to their home for a homecooked meal, which brings me to the no gursha policy. As amateur but well-travelled? Ethiopian food eaters,? we've built up a nice curriculum? vitae of places and experiences--dishes we've tried, in many cities, in several countries--and one of these is the gursha where the cook feeds the guests ceremonially in the same way you eat Ethiopian food. For those new to Ethiopian, you eat with your hands and you? share the plate, so for all you finger-lickers? out there, there's a reason your? friends leave you off the Ethiopian restaurant invites ;) So, if you do the math, when I say the Chef feeds you, I mean literally, by hand. Now, there is some history? to this, and there are? also different meanings? to different people, but I can only describe how it was introduced? to us. It was a very traditional scene, done to show maximum respect and appreciation for us; we appreciated the ?gesture? and went along with it in the way one does when one is \"on the spot\" and want?s to reciprocate the feeling of appreciation and respect. Having said all that, we'll never do it again, and we've made it a little anecdote we share with our Ethiopian hosts who, after the shock of hearing our story, laugh, then promise with a wink never to give us the gursha! 

I give this a solid 4 out of 5 only because some of the dishes we'd normally get simply weren't available? when we were there? but were on the menu to be fair, and we'd definitely? go back to try them, too! A note on Ethiopian restaurants: though definitely? \"in\" restaurants, abiding? by all the safety and health standards that make a good restaurant? (this place had their TO safety rating \"PASS\" posted), most really good Ethiopian places feel, and? often resemble, someone's house, and there's a casualness to exactly what's available? that day and how long that might take. We don't go to eat Ethiopian for the d√©cor or for the fast food; we go for fresh ingredients, intense flavours, made to order food, and that means sometimes, this meat or that cut isn't available? that night. This place was actually better than most for speed and selection, and our fresh order was served unexpectedly? quickly. 

Definitely,? a place we'd go to again when in Toronto, ?and? certainly? a place that would see? us as regulars if we lived in the area."}
{"text":"An absolutely excellent meal all around.

A friend and I came for dinner on a whim. I was craving Ethiopian food and we were in the area. The restaurant is comfortable, with big windows in the front and a large patio at the back. Service was very friendly without being intrusive. 

I don't know how to order Ethiopian food so we went for the vegetable platter and meat platter. It was enough for four people. I know this because we took leftovers home, which the server was nice enough to split for us. The food was fantastic: super flavourful and just the right amount of spice. We had Beau's dark on tap, which was super tasty, as well. The bill came to about $60 after tax and tip, which was more than reasonable for the amount of food and drink we had.

This would also be a great place to have a party. I know this because a friend of mine actually booked the whole space out for his birthday when it used to be the Magic Oven. Would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"This resto was an exciting find for a few reasons: 1. They're the only restaurant in the eastern downtown core besides Ethiopiques (which has horrible service for delivery, and is not allowed on JustEats anymore due to this.) 2. the owner is lovely and kind, so you want to support her. 3. If you are gluten-free, they have FRESH teff injera made in Ethiopia to offer (unlike Ethiopian House, or Ethiopiques -- the former which never has it and the latter which gives you injera so stale it's cracked). 4. this was the first Ethiopian restaurant in Toronto to actually give me exactly what I ordered! Rendez-vous has fantastic food, and I've ordered from them over 100 times, but I've NEVER received exactly what was described on the menu for the vegetarian platter, but instead, whatever they had around.

The food was good, and less oily and salty than other Ethiopian restos. The injera was fresh and tasty. The flavours of the dishes were good, but not quite as refined as at Rendez-vous. The chickpeas could have cooked a little longer as some were still crunchy and I prefer more of a mush than a thick paste (see the pic). Overall, this is the best experience I've had at any Ethiopian restaurant in Toronto so I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"My friend and I went here on a whim to try some Ethiopian food. The restaurant was empty when we walked except for a few regulars as it seemed. 
We ordered the vegetarian plate for one and the cabbage dish. They both came with injera bread. I would definitely say it was good food.
I would remove some stars just for the environment, it didn't feel very welcoming."}
{"text":"This is my first time eating Ethiopian food.. but it was soooo delicious. I went with spicy beef stew which was filling. The service was fast and I wish I had more time in Toronto or I would have gone here more often!"}
{"text":"Went here today with a small group of friends for late lunch.  Ordered the platter for two as well as the chic pea and beef dishes.  Everything was truly delicious, and the made-from-scratch coffee was to die for.  Each of us admitted to eating more than we should have because it was so good.  The proprietress was really helpful and enthusiastic.   Modern Ethiopian music in background was good and not loud.  Laid back atmosphere.  Will definitely return."}
