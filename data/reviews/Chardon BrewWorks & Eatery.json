{"text":"My wife and I went there for dinner.  We had been there a few times.  We were surprised that they no longer had a full menu. They are focusing on their brews and have a small menu of appetizers and sandwiches.  I had the Pub Boy with Maple Beer B Que Pulled Pork.  It was very good and somewhat different.  My wife had the boneless wings with the same Maple Beer B Que sauce.  Those were quite good also.  The service was a little on the slow side, and we had to go up to the bar each time we wanted to order.  We had the homemade bread pudding for dessert and it was excellent.  I had the Ironworker IPA and the Dark Sky Stout.  Both were very good.  Overall, it wasn't what we originally expected, but it was pretty good."}
{"text":"Great place for beer, not really for food.
The place is not named correctly, omit the \"& Eatery\" and get 5 stars.
The food is bar food and the menu limited.

But come for the Beer! It's very well-brewed and tasty.
When they brew a KÃ¶lsch it's exceptional.
It's a good local bar with the usual local flavor. The owner is sometimes there and he's intelligent and a good conversationalist.
There is no loud music and the lighting is adequate; this is not a dive bar by any means.
Local bands sometimes play there, it can be a let-down but that depends on the group.

They often have fun gimmicks. If I remember correctly, Tuesday is dollar-off night, Friday you can bring in a Vinyl record and they will play it (and give you a discount on your next beer), and if a Cleveland team is playing on the TV they will give a discount on drinks as well. I think they have a few more but I don't remember.
It's dog-friendly if that's your bag.

It's a great local place for beer and conversation."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic, the beer (minus the headache from the nitro injection) was on par for a new micro brew. Their POG Maple Porter really is their bread and butter for a reason.  The rest of the beers could use more refinement in their flavor profile. And in my opinion get rid of the nitrogen injection.

However, the whole experience was soured by a waitstaff that was more apt at disappearing than bringing out drinks, or even being mildly aware of their dinner guests. I am perfectly OK with waiting for food at a brewpub, IF you keep me supplied with your delicious beer. We had finished our first round of drinks well before our food arrived, but once it did, we were able to ask the waitress (who wasn't ours) to bring out a water and a Porter. Water arrived swiftly and she said the beer would be right out. 15 minutes later, no beer, and no sign of either waitress."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a casual beer. Love the atmosphere! Friendly locals and fantastic staff! The Honey Peach Kolsch was a
Amazing!! You must try this place! A hidden gem in Chardon, Ohio!"}
{"text":"This is a great little addition to the Chardon Square!  What a pleasant surprise to stumble onto a brewery in downtown.  The food was great and they use fresh ingredients.  They have an open mic night and kids eat free on Wednesdays."}
{"text":"The Pride of Geauga Maple Porter is one of my absolute favorite beers.  The first brewery in Geauga County since Prohibition is a MUST VISIT when you are in Chardon."}
{"text":"Such a cozy little place in Chardon Square. Staff is friendly and helpful. Didn't stay for dinner (heard that it wasn't worth staying). Beer is solid. I had their IPA and black IPA and thought both were very good."}
{"text":"Very unique......and located next to the public defender's office.  : )

A gem in the middle of nowhere, found when we were traveling through Ohio."}
{"text":"Food is good. Have had steak and seafood. Bar staff is cheerful and friendly. Recommend a reservation otherwise it's standing waiting for a seat."}
{"text":"Just a really weird place. Very small, menu even smaller. A lot of locals go there and pay cards. Just weird..."}
{"text":"Don't go here with the kids or even the wife, their old location had three times the seating and a much larger menu but now it only serves snack food and such. My family and I went in thinking it would be similar to the old location and could not find a place to sit down and did not see anyone eating anything. Good place to stop and grab a beer but that's it , that's the reason I gave it three stars because of their beer selection and the quality."}
{"text":"Real nice folks, decent beer, a true microbrewery. Great small town friendly people. It's what breweries are supposed to be. The beer was decent and drinkable. Probably not going to win many awards, but that isn't what this place is about. It just felt right, keep on keepin on!"}
{"text":"Service was very good. Went on a Saturday night and it was very crowded. Making a reservation is wise.

Food was nothing to write home about. Standard bar food. Onion rings were not homemade, boneless wings were sitting in grease, and the burger was the best part of my meal. 

And finally the BEER! Coming from Denver(beer Capitol) I had hopes this would be good beer. I was disappointed. I had 2 IPAs and 1 PA and both were lacking flavor and were not very hoppy at all. Tasted more like traditional ales...

I hate to write bad reviews but for the price of the beers I was hoping for good. Fail."}
{"text":"Great little beer spot!  Lots of cool stuff on the walls clebrating working class Cleveland history.  Tried 3 beers and all were great.  Cant believe they are all made in back on a system using refurbished kegs as the brew kettle and run-off!  When we came there was a snowstorm and we were literally the only 2 up in the place.  The girl working was literally the reason we stayed as long as we did.  Very abitious and proud about the beers without being all-knowing and preachey like a lot of new places.  They have food but we didnt try any.  Coming from the West Side this is like the other side of the world but it was worth it for sure!"}
{"text":"Went their yesterday while visiting boyfriend. Wasn't sure what beer to order so the bartender gave us some samples. The staff is friendly and helpful. I got the Chardon Summer Ale and loved it! We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"My wife and I checked this out Saturday night.  I'd say it was good, but not great.

She had the BBQ Chicken and I had the bratwurst.  The BBQ had a nice sauce, but the chicken was a little dried out.  The brats were good, but again not great.  I tried their Working Man's Ale (or something like that) she had a gin and tonic.  Again, a good beer, but not fantastic.  The service was good and there was a little three piece band mostly playing Rock & Roll and they were rather fun.

I'd go back, but I wouldn't rush back or travel great distances for it.  But a nice addition to Chardon Square."}
{"text":"We went here and will never go back. The employees are all kids except for the bartender who runs like crazy because she is the only one old enough to serve beer.
Was absolutely the worst service we've ever had.Had to sit up stairS at two tiny
cramped tables. The owner was there and he was berating the poor bartender
because she carried our food upstairs. The food was okay but certainly didnt
come close to making up for the horrible service.Will never go back and I wouldnt
recommend anyone wasting their time or money to go there. The customer isnt
considered to be very  important here."}
{"text":"I'm torn as it seems like they are in between concepts.  The full menu, which produced below average food has now been reduced and the focus seems to be on beer.  I like that idea, but still feel like the beer is lacking.  There are some options that seem to be tap worthy (Maple Porter and Barleywine), but a lot that seem to have been rushed or lacking mouthfeel (watery).  

This place has the bones to be charming, but it needs some help on the food and beer side.  The staff is friendly and works hard...get them the right product to sell and this place could be a fixture in Chardon."}
{"text":"We checked this place out on Saturday for dinner and a few brews. The menu is limited as far as entrees go but the burgers and sandwiches have quite the offering. A lot of the meals have a suggested beer paired with it and some are cooked with their beers. Prices are right and in line with most other pub style places. The upstairs loft bar is intimate and trendy and definitely the place to dine if it's just the two of you. You can try testers of the beers they offer for just $1.50. The beer selection is nice offering something for every palette, stouts, ipas, and the lighter choices. I enjoyed a pint of the honey cranberry and he had the working mans ipa as well as there christmas ale. The atmosphere is lacking something in the dining area but i cant put my finger on it, in time it will grow I'm sure. We will definitely be back with some friends to check it out again. The staff was helpful in the selection of both food and drinks and were quite friendly. This is something the Chardon square was lacking for a long time and I'm happy to see a place like this bring something to the small town.

As an update, we were there on a Saturday night, service was super slow and the bartender a bit rude. This was unfortunate because we brought another couple with us and they were disappointed. The food was good and beers were okay but nothing that took us by storm. My suggestion, stay away on the weekends, this place is too small to deal with a bigger crowd. Bumped down to three stars :("}
{"text":"A few weekends ago, the boyfriend and I were out doing fall stuff (pumpkins, taking a day trip in the country side, the good things in life). We wanted to watch the Browns game, so we stumbled upon this little brewery. Private brewery with some pub food is always right down my alley. They were out of the maple porter (which seems to be their anchor beer), so I tried the pumpkin beer. I forget what style of beer it was, but it was okay. The food prices were high, and the portions were small for the quality we got. My burger (the big beer bq) was lukewarm and well done (when we were asked, I said medium rare). Fern got the buffalo mac n cheese which was also just meh. I guess we were a little more enchanted with the place because the Browns won, but on our way home we both felt sick to our stomachs. The only reason for the second star is because the server was nice and I liked my beer, but Chardon BrewWorks, you can do better."}
{"text":"Wow . . . Worst service we've ever had. EVER! it's not the bartender's fault, but wow this is just BAD. we got here at 4p. Ordered at 4.10p. Didn't get our food until after 5p! We ordered two chicken sandwiches. My boyfriends ordered one with no cole slaw on it. 55 minutes later, we get our food and his has slaw on it. Cook says it will take ten minutes to get another CHICKEN SANDWICH. my boyfriend liked the beer, but it is definitely is not worth it for the horrible service that you will get here. Wow. That's all we can say."}
