{"text":"I went here for a weekday lunch and ordered a chicken/beef combo plate. The meat was somewhat cold and the rice lacking flavour. The salad had too much cabbage and not much else, and dressing was dumped on it before I had time to respond properly with a \"yes or no\". Oh! and when I asked for the garlic and hot sauce \"on the side\", the lady working in an assembly line sort of setup said \"sure\" and dumped hot-sauce in one corner of my Styrofoam container, and garlic sauce in the other. On top of that, the hot sauce was REALLY cold! and made my luke-warm pieces of chicken and beef even colder and more unappetizing.  When we reached the end of the assembly line, the lady informed us they did not take credit cards, and as we took out our debit cards she let another customer pay (in the 10 seconds it took us!!) and then said in a rude tone \" So are you ready to pay now?\".  Awful customer service, the food quality has definitely gone down, and just because you are busy during lunch rush hour does not justify serving crap food and having a sour attitude. The only two things that are preventing me from giving this place an outright zero(if i could) are the decent roast potatoes and the *possibly* still good lentil soup mentioned in my last review."}
{"text":"I went for a quick sandwich during my lunch break, it's OK but not impressive,they reheated some precut chicken on the grill, I always prefer the shawerma to be  be cut from the skewer while its perfectly cooked."}
{"text":"Really bad, tried liking it. Zero flavor in any of the items. Hopefully they get some inspiration and try harder. Lentil soup was water with a small amount of lentil color. Tabouli was very bland. Just disappointing experience overall, again I really wanted to like it, the couple running the place seemed nice. Hope they make changes and it gets better."}
{"text":"Stopped in here real quick for lunch.  The men working were polite and patient, although I was a bit concerned when I first entered because we were the only ones there. More people walked in later on though. My order (I forgot what it was) was in a box and filled - full of the salad, meat, rice, beans, and sauce that I asked for. The flavors were there and complemented each other, although I couldn't finish because it was so much.  2 stars for food, and another star for their customer service :)"}
{"text":"I just ate the worst falafel I have ever tasted in my life.  Picked up my order of a falafel wrap at 2PM.  The falafel had a very prominent/strong taste of licorice (anise?). It was so overpowering,  you can't taste anything else. It had a chunky and crumbly consistency. They were not smooshed in the wrap like other places normally do. The falafel was rock hard - I was unable to break them apart with a plastic fork. It was not freshly fried and seemed like it had been sitting around for hours.  I didn't enjoy the toppings either - red and yellow hot peppers, pickles, pickled turnip and lettuce.   They do not use tinfoil or wax paper to wrap the wrap. They place the wrap in PAPER bag.  My wrap ripped open along the seam on the walk back to work, it soaked through the paper bag. I propped it up on my desktop so the lettuce wouldn't completely fall out the bottom. I finally dropped the remainder of about half the wrap into my coffee mug at work and ate it like a salad.  At the end, I was eating just the lettuce in garlic sauce and purposely avoiding the chunks of falafel.  I regret eating so much of this falafel wrap. My mouth hates me and I need to eat something else to make the awful flavour go away."}
{"text":"No flavors in meat, they even managed to screw the baklava. Two stars only for the quantity."}
{"text":"I can't believe this place is open. My falafel sandwich had zero flavour. My husband who was fasting for 18 hours and starving couldn't even finish his chicken shawarma sandwich because it was so bad."}
