{"text":"This is our place!  They just started all you can eat sushi, too!  Order the volcano roll!"}
{"text":"Really like Kawaii for multiple reasons. We first tried this place with a discount offer and it happened to be during happy hour. They were happy to honor the discount on the happy hour specials too which is something we appreciate as it shows they are not petty and that they care about customer service.  We ordered some extra stuff because of this just so they did not lose money on us. Their kindness payed off with good karma.      We have been back several times and had sushi rolls.  However, my husband does not like seaweed so ask the rolls to be made with soy paper instead.  They were happy to do it and did not charge anything extra for it unlike many other sushi places that will add an extra charge. Once again we really appreciate the customer service.       Another thing they have is a Sunday brunch all you can eat sushi offering. This is unusual in Arizona and love that they do it. Going out for sushi can often add up quick no matter were you go and for what a few rolls might cost you could do all you can eat at Kawaii during Sunday brunch.  Now they do limit the sashimi to 4 slices of each type of fish but no limit on rolls or nigiri and furthermore it includes for no additional charge some appetizers and drink options as well which makes it a nice experience."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! Every roll I have tried I really like. I have not been disappointed. Plus the are reasonable!"}
{"text":"Food is always fresh and tasty. Staff is friendly and accommodating. The service can be slow at times when busy. Overall a great neighborhood sushi go to. I love the creative rolls like the 67th Ave. roll."}
{"text":"Gosh... Maybe it was because it was a Friday evening, but it was PACKED. Though we quickly got seated in the corner bench, we actually had to put our hands high up just to catch their attention. I swear, if we never spoke up, they would of just ignored us until closing time. However, the food was still amazing, I just recommend to go on a weeknight or when there's nobody there."}
{"text":"I came to Phoenix from Los Angeles, this restaurant is delicious to surprise me! Very fresh food, friendly service, in the future I will come to Phoenix for this!"}
{"text":"Huh not good. Nice and clean place but need lots of improvement on food. Shrimps tempura was a 1 star!"}
{"text":"I've eaten there twice so far and I really don't care for it.  If you've never had quality Japanese Cuisine you'll probably thinks it's good.  I didn't care for their seating arrangements.  Orders aren't brought out at the same time, one in the group was half finished with her meal before we were finally served our sushi.  The Wonton Soup was nothing special, average at best.  The sushi was small and warm, sort of gooey, and I don't mean the rice. Bare minimums, just enough, nothing more is how I would explain it, except for the price.  It seems like they skimp on everything, service, quality. Go eat at Ra Sushi then check this place out and see what you think."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of this place. It's near my home and they have accommodated any special sushi or meal requests with no issues. I have a ten year old daughter who comes with me and loves salmon sushi and sashimi.  She also have food allergies And every time I ask for accommodations, they are always met with no issues.  I also find that the chinese items they have on the menu are also vey good. I would give this place five stars, but I haven't had everything yet and only go when it's not busy. Let me go when it's stress time and try a few more things before I give that extra star. I expect it won't be long.  Money wise a good value also. Nothing seemed extra expensive and portion sizes work for the money you spend."}
{"text":"Food was great, service was awesome, and the ambience matched.   Kelly was super nice and we will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"If you want a quiet, elegant place, check Kawaii out! It so happened I was around town, when I spotted this location. My first day, they gave me a free mango dessert cake."}
{"text":"We go there as a family all the time because the food is wonderful and it's very close. However, there is a particular Hostess/Waitress that refuses to take my order (but acknowledges the rest of my family members) and then brings me the wrong dish that I did not order and does not try to correct it in any way. She does not bring plates and my husband has to go up to the sushi bar and request plates to eat with all most every time. Great food but the horrible service makes it almost dreadful to eat there. If my family didn't love it and it was blocks from my home, I would pass on eating there."}
{"text":"We have been here numerous times and we love this local place. Kelly the owner is great and is usually there. The sushi is good and the other Chinese dishes are also worth ordering. The bar is well stocked and they will make what ever you can think of."}
{"text":"The food is VERY fresh and delicious, the staff is friendly and the restaurant is so clean!!! Great happy hour specials and the regular menu is great too! You must check this place out if you are looking for sushi and/or Asian cuisine!!!"}
{"text":"2nd time here. Really enjoyed the sushi. Of course we always enjoy the sushi unless it's really bad. This was very good and we will be back.   We love yen but they are far from our house for a quick dindin, so great to find something good very close to our house. Yeah!!  Finally a local rest. I can get behind."}
{"text":"I'm new to the neighborhood and bought a living social deal for this place to check it out. I was pleasantly surprised! The place was busy, but we only waited 5 minutes for a table. The service was wonderful. Multiple staff cleared our table, filled our drinks, brought the food, etc.  Good team work! The sushi was fresh and delish! We will be back for sure. Good neighborhood staple. Also, wonderful happy hour EVERYDAY OF THE WEEK. 50% of hot appetizers."}
{"text":"Love this sushi place. The food is always fresh and delicious. We used to dine in a lot, but it has gotten so popular here now that we get take out mostly instead. Can be pricey but the food is very good."}
{"text":"Good sushi seems hard to find out here.  This place is decent, they give you a little orange desert at the end for free which is nice.  When I was there, it was completely empty...not sure why because it is a pretty good place for the price.  Not awesome, but not bad. A-OK."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! The sushi is absolutely wonderful! Full bar at a sushi restaurant... What!!! Great staff... Bruce Lee is a sushi master and the owner is so freaking friendly. I literally can't wait to come back! The cha cha roll is like candy to your mouth! Thank you Kelly... Bailey... Gabriella"}
{"text":"Just went in sat down and waited 16 minutes and was never asked what we even wanted to drink. There were only 3 other tables occupied. I have never had the kind of service ANYWHERE!! And the prices were the most expensive I have ever seen for rolls. Their happy hour prices were as much as Ah So regular prices. Never again!"}
{"text":"My background...general manager in the resturaunt business over 20 years, food blogger and restaurant reviewer....two words....SILVER DRAGON resturaunt the epitome of perfection!  I am one to focus on the positive....not the negative especially being in the business for so long...Anyone that truly knows me, knows that about me...focus on the good....however what I encountered at kawaii last night, with kelly the owner has been engrained in my head and reminds me why certain business owners may know certain aspects about running resturaunts but common sense,  how to retain customers and treating others the way you want to be treated is something this owner lacks big time!  To be fair and honest I will say when we have been there during the day and there has been only a very few in the resturaunt the food has been good and the owners friend who has waited on us on a very regular basis has been great. We WERE regulars....2-3 times a week...you figure out over almost 6 months a family of 5 $$$  The last three times we have been there have been disasters....even the servers when they saw us this evening came up to us and said hopefully tonight will be better it's early enough and there shouldn't be any issues....the previous three times....we waited for our food for so long we inquired whether the orders were even put in....the last time the gentleman server even apologized to us and was so frustrated himself and made some comments I don't care to repeat...but all in all confirmed everything we were frustrated about. That particular dinner we not only were there for over two hours, got the wrong food but also missed a movie we had bought tickets for.  Last night we had a server we have had several times before, she also made a comment about us being there at a earlier time and said tonight should be a better experience....I have met Kelly before (the owner) Why go back after three negative experiences? Because I am quick to give people the benefit of the doubt and being in the business I know how crazy it can get.  Ordered our food...there were only four of us this evening....had the server repeat the order to make sure it was correct....first my husbands came.....then 8 minutes later my sons and then I stopped the server and said why can't they all be brought out together and on a timely basis? She said I made a point of telling the kitchen that and then 10 minutes later my other son got his food and then I got mine...I called the server over nicely and I said I specifically requested mushrooms and onions on here and she said I know, I wrote it down and told the kitchen, beside the egg foo young being over cooked it was missing the ingredients I asked for and can't eat water chestnuts and they were in there.   She was very kind and said you are correct I am so very sorry. Kelly came over after I asked to speak with her....instead of her worrying about closing out and running the tabs...a good manager/owner visits with each and every table asking how things are and if they need anything...not her, every time we have seen her she is up at the register closing out the bills dealing with the money.  She said \"we only have two cooks in the kitchen\" and \"the mushrooms and onions are inside the egg foo young\" I cut it in half and said where? I get this every time and it is always on top  ...if I am paying for something, it should be done correctly....and that isnt the way egg foo young is made and has never been made that way there, instead of being honest and saying we forgot and it was chaos in the kitchen she made excuses and lied. I finally said Kelly we have been coming her for over 6 months 2-3 times a week this isn't the way you should react or treat customers let along regulars...she walked away and the server came over and I asked for them to remake it properly.... 20 minutes later my food came, everyone was done eating, plates were all cleared and guess what NO ONIONS...I was appalled...showed the server and by that time I just said please get me a box, we are leaving as I was so aggravated by the whole experience. The bill came and she didn't comp anything even the server said she should have taken mine off the bill. I approached her and said I came to eat with my family, not to eat alone, your kitchen made a mistake both times why should I have to pay for their mistakes,she said because we made it twice especially for you...?? Really??? The first one was overcooked, ingredients were missing, and the second one the ingredient was missing and we waited over two hours, as a business owner you don't think you should do something for us for the inconvenience? Her response no.....I walked out with my family when another patron reached out to me and said she heard how disrespectful Kelly was and they too had a similar experience and would never return.   It isn't just about the food...it is about treating and respecting your customers that makes a business successful! Put yourself in your customers shoes Kelly !"}
{"text":"The beef terriyaki was terrible. It tasted like the meat had been frozen for months. The price was expensive too. We also ordered a couple of rolls. They tasted ok but way over priced for the portion size. I do not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Kawaii Sushi and Asian Cuisine is the best in the Valley for authentic gourmet Chinese food! My mother is Chinese & I have experienced gourmet chinese food all over the United States and California in particular. Kawaii exceeded & surpassed my expectations by far. I was tremendously pleased with all of the chinese appetizers, soups, & dishes. If I had to choose my favorite it would be the cashew chicken. The fried rice is the best I've had in Arizona & probably the world hands down. I would drive to Kawaii just for the fried rice & I live in Scottsdale. If that doesn't tell you how good it is then I don't know what else to say. I particularly like the vegetable fried rice, it is the best I have ever had. Kelly the Owner/Manager is a terrific host and is very knowledgeable about the food as well as the wines. She is always updating the menu with new items, drink specials, and has made some great recommendations. The staff is always friendly and attentive. I don't like egg in my rice and customize my orders, they never mind, and have never gotten them wrong. One time I forgot to mention that in my order and it came my way, they remembered I liked it that way, I was blown away, talk about customer service! The sushi bar has a nice vibe and they have a modern, very stylish, decor thats goes along with some asian style artwork on the walls and it really blends well. The restaurant is extraordinarily clean. I noticed it had a A rating and a award from CBS news for being 5 star clean. It has a nice little patio outside for extra outdoor seating. And, there are some nice TV's inside. They play some cool music in there too I noticed, adding to the hip ambiance & environment inside. I tried some of the sushi rolls, edamame, & the miso soup, it was super too! I just have a hard time not choosing the chinese dishes there because they remind me of California & have that true Chinese taste yet maintaining a twist to their own Kawaii inspired fusion of traditional chinese flavors. Overall, I am just impressed from top to bottom with this place. It just has a trendy, fresh, classy environment inside and the food has been terrific every time. With the atmosphere, service, drinks, and quality of the food it is like fine dining at a fraction of the price. They seem to be getting busier as I see more customers each time I go. Give this place a try and I promise you will be a repeat customer. This is one of the few 5 star reviews I have given on yelp."}
{"text":"Amazing! My bf took me here and it was outstanding! Kelly (owner?) is so nice and friendly. Sushi is great and the white peach saki was so good. Yes, yes."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood restaurant! The sushi is always good and fresh. We recently tried their Chinese food and it was excellent as well! I think they have the best orange chicken and pork fried rice I've ever had. Everything I have ordered has been delicious. The only problem we have is trying to decide what to order because everything is so good...It has a nice comfortable atmosphere with a combination of booth,table, and sushi bar seating with a couple of TV's to watch a game if you're a sports fan.  The owner (Kelly) is so friendly and always makes sure you are having a great experience. She   makes you feel welcome and goes out of her way to personally say hello no matter how busy she is.    I would definitely recommend giving this nice little restaurant a try. It's a gem."}
{"text":"Good food and nice people working here. The place gets a little busy on weekends so I always try to come on weekday nights to avoid the wait."}
{"text":"My family and I go here often because it is close to our house, and every time we eat here it seems better than the time before. My favorites are the Kawaii roll, yellowtail sushi, and the samurai roll. The fish is always fresh and the service is wonderful! The last time we ate here we decided to order extra yellowtail sushi (because it was so good) and Kelly brought us out special yellowtail toro. Then, after we had finished the special sushi she had brought us without even having to ask, Kelly brought us another different yellowtail sushi! It was yellowtail toro wrapped in a delicate spiral of cucumber, with sprouts beautifully placed and sprinkled with scallions. This did not have a name yet, but was one of the best sushi dishes I had ever had, and it was  beautifully placed. I love it here and can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"We love Kawaii! We've been frequenting Kawaii on a regular basis for several months. Not only is the food is amazing but the staff is incredible and so friendly! We absolutely love this place and highly recommend it to anyone looking to enjoy fabulous food at a fantastic price!"}
{"text":"My husband and I checked out Yelp for a sushi restaurant, and Kawaii JC had the best recent reviews, even though it was a bit of a drive.  We got here at 5:30pm for the happy hour, and got two 99 cent appetizers with drinks.  We ordered a fried roll, a chef's roll and a regular (free)- all were great!  We're definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Wow! Very surprising!  We went in thinking we'd get the Chinese food on the menu, but branched out and had the sushi.  Such a great idea!  I had the Dynamite roll, my mom had the Pink Lady roll, and my dad had the Monsoon roll.  They were all delicious!  We also had the crab puffs and they were also tasty. It was a great place and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We went here for the first time. We were very pleased. The food was great! We got a Flaming Dragon roll and it was one of the best we've ever had. I also orders the Lo Mein and it was hot and yummy. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Although the food is tasty the service is terrible! We have been several times and have had issues each time! Forgetting to bring out food, not filling water, charging extra for rice when all they bring you is 1 little cups worth for each main dish you order!  How expensive is rice anyways?!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had a really awful experience at Kawaii last night. We called in for take out and were told it would take 20-25 minutes. We arrived about 25 minutes later and my husband went in to pick up the food. After waiting for about 30 minutes in the car I decided to go inside and make sure everything was okay. My husband had paid and was sitting there waiting, with no idea why it was taking so long. When he had first entered the restaurant he waited about 5 minutes while the hostess was on the phone with another distraught customer who had ordered takeout and half of their order was left out. While we waited for our food that customer's food was remade, they drove their and picked it up while we were still waiting. Finally we tried to ask someone where our food was and we were blown off. After another 5 minutes of waiting we walked to the back of the restaurant near the kitchen and flagged a waiter down asking what was going on. He asked what we had ordered so my husband walked to the host stand and grabbed our ticket to show him. The waiter disappeared to the back and came back saying it would be one minute. The sushi chef grabs a carton of sushi that we had seen sitting on the bar for the last 35-40 minutes and puts it in a bag and angrily shoves it toward the waiter. We finally got our food, well over an hour after we had placed our order and with no explanation or apology by the staff. When we arrived home, it tasted like it had been sitting out for a very long time and we barely ate any because of the taste. My husband then ended up getting sick from it. We are so frustrated and disappointed after spending almost $70 for such a poor experience."}
{"text":"Three years ago this place could prepare some decent sushi. Tonight was a different story. In fact it was downright AWFUL! The sake was colder than the beer. The sushi was drizzled with eel sauce....all of it. The chefs spoke no English. I asked what was \"fresh\" and they all just smiled. The Korean waitress/hostess/bartender ran over and told me \"everything is fresh\" as she waved her hand in front of the coolers glass display ala Vanna White style. Honey, its Tuesday and all of your fish is wrapped in plastic so don't tell me its all fresh when it is clearly not fresh. I could go on and on but I won't. I'll never go back because this place is just horrible. Do yourself a favor and go to Tokyo Lobby which serves edible sushi or go over to Paradise Valley and eat at Yazu Bistro which is some of the best in town.  Honey!!! Where's the Maalox????"}
{"text":"I have given this place an entire handful of tries but I am done. The sushi here is very bland and nothing special. There are definitely better sushi restaurants out there."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced, with good happy hour specials. Glad to find this place close to home. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Some of the freshest Asian food around,always very good Great atmosphere awesome wait staff"}
{"text":"We come here for Sunday lunch fairly regularly. Food is tasty and of good quality.  Everything is always fresh. There is a nice variety of food as you can get Chinese, Japanese, and good sushi. Service is always good. I only wish portions were larger so I could take some home, but I never leave hungry."}
{"text":"This is a great place to have sushi. This is my 3rd time trying this restaurant. I think all of the food is amazing. My personal favorite is the fried rice. Tonight got a little busy when we went in. Our server Patrick was back and forth with several tables. I appreciated him checking on us several times during dinner even though he was super busy. Keep up the good work Patrick. You've got a friendly personality and we enjoyed your smile. We look forward to seeing you next time we come in."}
{"text":"Good food paired with attentive and nice staff! We've had an enjoyable experience the both times we've sat down here. The egg drop soup was really yummy and came out within 5 minutes of ordering our food. There are large portions of the entrees, but I wish there was a bit more vegetables in the dishes given. I'm assuming more rice will come out when asked, but we didn't stay long enough to know.   Orange beef - this was surprisingly delicious. The beef stayed crispy and the orange sauce was not overwhelmingly sweet.   General Tso's chicken - one of the best in the area!  I will be coming back to check out more food!"}
{"text":"Kawaii just opened a few months ago. I've been there more than five times since.. it's just great! The atmosphere is quiet and they have unique tables that have double sided seats. So you are close to the people eating around you. Their food is fresh and affordable! They have a daily lunch special where you can get 3 rolls, a salad, and miso soup for $11!! And you have a list of 15 or so to choose from. If you purchase a beer or sake, you get a $.99 appetizer. The waiters are family and work every day and they are the nicest people I have met in a while. Five stars!"}
{"text":"I like this restaurant. Good food and people. Today I enter the restaurant @12:10 no guest in the restaurant. A waitress was busy rolling napkins.No welcome from her. I thought she was new. Because we've been here often and we've never seen her. We have a dog in a stroller so we went to patio.We never have issue with our dog in patio. We never took dog out from stroller and he does not bark.. Not today.She told us her manager no longer welcome dog in patio and she has 3 years experience with this restaurant.Even she is experienced she did not bring water,no soda refill offered.The worst service I have been here. We did no see the manager so I am not sure about dog policy."}
{"text":"Food is subpar, and service is awful most of the time... Even when the joint is empty.  Wtf"}
{"text":"It might be a bit out of the way for most of us in the area, but it's fantastic!  We actually only got rolls, because they have a bunch of really unique ones...and they were so good we skipped dessert to get an extra roll!  I forget what it was called, but it had paper-thin lemon slices on top...we had a second one of that.  It's a tiny little place, and sometimes they only have one server, so if you're in a hurry you may want to sit at the bar.  The wait wasn't all that long though, because once the server gets you settled somebody else usually brings your food for you."}
{"text":"Very tasty sushi, very good service. The vegas roll was the best I've had anywhere. Service was very quick and restaurant was very clean. The California roll I didn't like too much, it just came with a cut crabstick inside. Overall prices were on the expensive side, but a lot more manageable if you get the living social deal."}
{"text":"BEST SUSHI IN PEORIA!!  I absolutely LOVE this restaurant! Beautifully decorated and wonderfully situated this place has everything you need to satisfy your Asian cravings in a comfortable friendly environment. The owner (Kelly) is a very sweet and very talented young woman who has always been very accommodating (along with ALL of the staff) With many of the items on the menu being her own creations you have plenty of fresh twists on sushi to chose from as well as all of your traditional Asian dishes. I highly recommend the \"Maggie Shrimp\" and ANY of the Sushi Rolls (if your not a fan of seaweed they will wrap the rolls with rice paper:)  This is a restaurant that gets it right in every way and every time, trust me."}
{"text":"Good sushi. Quick and efficient customer service. The restaurant was decorated very nicely and the ambiance was pleasant. I would come back again when I am in the area!"}
{"text":"Don't know why we waiting so long to eat here...but well worth the wait. We had a Groupon, which is what prompted us to try Kawaii Sushi. We came for lunch, and the restaurant was about 1/3 full. Looks like a lot of people were ordering the lunch specials, which looked amazing. Big portions for a reasonable price. The restaurant remained busy while we were there with lots of take out orders as well. The restaurant is clean and modern....and strangely enough, I really enjoyed the music they were playing. They have a good size sushi bar as well as inside and patio seating. Owner said that it gets busy during weekend dinner time, but good news! They take reservations.  We wanted to taste a lot of different things on the menu. The menu is diverse and has something for everyone. We started with the pan fried dumplings which were big and tasty, served with a mild dipping sauce. Then we had an avocado salad which was sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds and came with a mild sweet and sour ( and maybe ginger) dipping sauce. Then we had had an order of California rolls and veggie rolls. Both were delicious! Very fresh and perfectly seasoned. The rolls come with a side of wasabi and pickled ginger. Then came the veggie tempura. Super light, not greasy at all. Totally hit the spot.   While we could have stopped there, we really wanted to try the Mongolian beef and pork fried rice. The Mongolian beef was abundant with well seasoned and tender beef, and a proportionate amount of yellow onions and scallions. We loved the pork fried rice...full of fresh veggies and great taste!  And again, we could have stopped there, but we ended this really delicious lunch with a sweet treat of tempura green tea ice cream! Yummo!  Looks like we found our new favorite place. Fresh and tasty food, versatile menu, great sushi, very nice atmosphere, and super nice staff and owners. Next time we go, we're bringing our friends! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Oh man I am so bummed! First time here and was so excited based on reviews. I order wonton soup and orange chicken and asked for extra spicy.  The place seemed cleaned and the hostess was professional and very welcoming.   The wonton soup has great sized and full wontons but the soup has so little flavor! Needs lemongrass or something. So much potential and yet so bland.  Orange chicken had literally zero kick. None. Again even without the spice kinda bland? Close like the soup just missing something special even if not spicy.   With some minor changes it could be amazing but lack luster now. I'll try one more time perhaps... sad I didn't have any kick like I asked for..."}
{"text":"First time eating here. We ordered avocado salad. It was very tasty. Dressing was light and citrusy. We have usually had a ginger dressing with it, but it was good. Colorado river roll was very good. It had shrimp, spicy tuna, avocado and eel sauce. Presented nicely and tightly rolled so you can fit it into your mouth. Chicken tempura was our next choice. It was different and I really couldn't say I would get it again but it was something we tried. The shrimp tempura roll was thick. The rice was extremely sticky and we had a hard time chewing and swallowing. I wouldn't get that again. Our rule is to try a new sushi place twice before we commit to being a \" fav\" but overall it was a good start. Pleasant servers and attentive."}
{"text":"We love coming here! Prices are great. The orange chicken is the best I have had. Service is very friendly and prompt. The portions are huge and the entire family loves to go there!"}
{"text":"Honestly I was hesitant to try a new sushi place nearby, and on a holiday! But we came by for our lil fam tradition, no reservation, fam of 5 - peak time it turns out to add, and this place delivered! Fresh yellowtail, 2 well put together spicy rolls, accommodating to younger palates to top it off! This was our first visit (and my very first review) but apparently this was quite a crowd for this quaint but well done place, and they really did a nice job! Accommodating and pleasant! Keep up your fresh presentation and variety, we will for sure be back! Thank you for a nice family Valentine's dinner"}
{"text":"Rolls a really spectacular. They are not that large in diameter but they are bite-size.  The sake bombers are huge amounts of sake.  The owner lady is super funny and just a blast have fun with.  The prices are starting to go a little bit out of line.  Overall it is a really good experience even though it is a little too overpriced."}
{"text":"Best sushi!! Great food and even better service! Everyone will make you feel so welcome, especially Kelly! We have never been disappointed here. Great lunch specials and happy hour. Our favorite rolls are: pink lady, spicy tuna, philly, c4 roll and our very favorite, spicy girl roll."}
{"text":"Average sushi with above average prices. Nothing really special about the food. Fresh wasabi would be a nice touch.   Atmosphere is good. Nice wall decor. Average bar, sushi and drink. I didn't notice and maybe they did have, but a couple signature drinks could be offered.  Very prompt wait staff. Best part of visit.  Restrooms are clean with a look of DIY decor.  Could improve on Happy Hour prices and choices, along with regular prices."}
{"text":"There was so many vegan options I was so thankful! Compared to other sushi places...and the waitress put sauces on the side as an option because she knew a lot of vegans don't like extra sauces or calories. The drinks were wrong which is great. One of the reason my husband and I will be back! Service was pretty good and it was a beautiful little restaurant with nice bathrooms too. Glad we had an adventure and checked it out!!! Will be back with the kids. Love it and will come back!"}
{"text":"They were nice enough to cook lobster for me that wasn't currently on the menu but it came horribly overcooked, and the way they present it is cut into bite-sized pieces still in the shell parts. Very hard to eat and requires you use your fingers if you want to eat it. Not good for a $37 meal."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi and Chinese food. Service is great and Kelly is always smiling! I highly recommend eating here. I do once a week on average. The orange chicken is the best I have had anywhere! Eat here, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Food was nothing special or authentic, the jalapeño bombers looked like mashed spam stuffed in a jalapeño, the Las Vegas roll was soggy and the soba noodles looked and tasted like microwaveable noodles with some chicken thrown in, no flavor. Service was great right when we walked into the door that's what got the place 2 stars."}
{"text":"The sushi was good, but the roles were a bit small for the price. Was offered the house wine and the glass came dirty and 10 or so minutes after ordering. Guess it was an experience but left hungry."}
{"text":"We visited Kawaii again on a Sunday evening. We sat at a table for two by the window overlooking the patio dining.  The atmosphere was upbeat, there were many people asking to assist us, to the point that one helper interrupted the server who was attempting to take our order. Needless to say, over the top service!    We had purchase a $40 for $20 on Local Flavor, which made our already inexpensive meal even better. We ordered egg drop soup, this time filled with egg, in fact, so much egg many spoonfuls were almost all egg. A nice change to most soups, which are mainly water.   We then ordered the Rock Shrimp and Crab Puffs. Both piping hot and delicious. Then on to Sushi!  We simply couldn't pass up the spicy California roll. The server waited on us constantly, and we received our order swiftly, arriving just as we finished our appetizers. Then, on to dessert!  As before we did not get a dessert menu, but really didn't need one. The deep fried banana and ice cream was once again selected and was once again delicious!    If you are seeking a small local place to call your sushi headquarters, this is definitely the place. Fast, friendly and  DELICIOUS, leaving us coming back for more.   Next trip, orange chicken, fried rice, maybe a scorpion roll, or some other awesome sushi dish. Then.... Yup, fried bananas!  Why switch from a great thing?"}
{"text":"This is a hidden sushi gem on Happy Valley! Service is great and the sushi is always fresh and top notch! If you aren't into sushi the cooked tools and dishes are awesome! I have been coming here for over 2 years and have never had a bad experience! I highly recommend this place for lunch of dinner!"}
{"text":"Get sushi from a grocery store! Same quality as this place! 1/3 the cost! I have never been to a restaurant that just decided to add a surcharge for \"being busy\""}
{"text":"Kawaii is a great neighborhood place for food and drinks.  The staff is super friendly and the owner, Kelly, is always very welcoming and makes you feel at home.  I highly recommend all their sushi rolls.  My kids and I also love their orange chicken.  Overall we have never had anything that wasn't good.    Two thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best sushi place I have ever been to.  Their food is great, they have great specials ALL the time and the staff is very friendly.  We come here for birthdays, anniversaries and we even bring our clients here.  I love this place!"}
{"text":"So far I wanted the all you can eat brunch that they advertised.  So sorry you can't have that, so I ordered the poke salad,waiter comes back and says we only have it in tuna, no salmon,I told her a poke salad, never said anything about salmon.  She comeback again with a picture of the poke salad and asks again,  this one.  Yes it's the only poke they have. Omg what the hell am I in for? Well the sushi was of good quality although they did forget to make a few of the rolls.  We had also asked for spicy mayo but their answer was we don't make spicy avocado roll? no we asked for spicy mayo. The chicken wraps have a lot to be desired ad they are bland and served with hoisin sauce. Hot and sour soup was good. Don't think we'll ever go back."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. Prefer to go for lunch. Dinner is a bit crowded. Always welcomed and service is good."}
{"text":"Now, I'm probably not the best person to review a sushi place as I'm not a fan of the raw stuff.  Kawaii has all the bases covered though-my Yaki Soba was quite good and my friends really enjoyed the Philly rolls and spicy tuna.  The restaurant is decorated very nicely and the staff is attentive and helpful.  Too swank for being next to a Wal Mart store :) I'd go back to Kawaii, a sure sign of an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Food was fresh!  Enjoyed everything we ordered , squid salad, avocado salad, California roll, screaming O, and a couple other rolls I can't recall the names.  We will return."}
{"text":"What a great little sushi joint!  The menu was varied and they have an enormous selection of rolls.  Prices are what you'd expect although I'm sure you could save a little coin by ordering platters or going to happy hour.  You know how some rolls come with six pieces, some with eight, etc?  All of the rolls we ordered were 10 pieces (I think - I wasn't counting, I was eating).  No skimping on size here!    My only two criticisms are:   Have a sushi list so the old people don't have remember things.  :)    I ordered a ginger beer and she brought it in the can (which is fine) but it was a Fry's ginger beer (that is less fine).  I think it's a bit tacky to be served a grocery store brand.    Good to know there are other local options - I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Freaking amazing.  Got my right hand woman raised on the island of Oahu and she gives it two thumbs up in Z formation.   Poke was fresh and so so good. Sushi was amazingly fresh compared to other comparable places near by in the same price range (Sakana, Ohso).  Everything down to the ice tea was great.  Servers were on their game as well.  Keep up the awesomeness."}
{"text":"Fabulous sushi place that is family owned and operated. The owner is very active in the community as well."}
{"text":"I am sad that I no longer live in walking distance but I still get take out from here and my favorite is the 7pc sushi with tuna roll and extra wasabi - I like my nose to run :)  I have never been disappointed with the food and actually really want some now that I am writing this. The staff is always friendly, the decor is clean and crisp and, if you eat there - the saki is yummy as is the edamame."}
{"text":"Yum yum this place is super good. Everything I have ordered has been very good. The sushi, shrimp fried rice and egg drop soup are my favorite."}
{"text":"I enjoy my sashimi, sushi, wine, and more.  Always fresh, great service and I enjoy my quiet time at the sushi bar. Oh, and Kelly sometimes hooks me up with some interesting wine samples."}
{"text":"You get treated like family in Kawaii restaurant. The owner, builds relationships with customers by getting to know your family. That's why there is a lot of patrons coming back to this restaurant. You can tell by the picture postings in Yelp mainly customers dining.   The menu consist of Chinese  and Japanese food items. My favorite is the love boat. A large collection of sashimi and sushi rolls. It's so pretty to look at and yummy!"}
{"text":"My new favorite sushi place. Great service helpful staff.  Wasabi rush roll is hands down the best sushi save for the spicy tuna roll. Fish tastes fresh and good thick cuts of it. Ask for fresh wasabi. Ask for Erin for sushi and Gabriella for your waitress ."}
{"text":"Overpriced and orange chicken is over cooked and dry/tough to eat. Poor quality of food for the price."}
{"text":"Our favorite sushi place! Fish is always fresh, rolls taste great and the orange chicken is our favorite! It's always pretty busy (because it's good!) so you may want to get there before the rush or sit at the sushi bar. The sushi chefs are not very talkative like some sushi places- they are strictly business and the wait staff are the ones that will deliver everything to you. This place is family owned and even the owner will walk out food to a table, they value the customers and are always nice!"}
{"text":"I always eat sushi is the best.  I read some of the negative reviews and most of it is the wait.  Hey I don't mind waiting for great food.  So pick your poison.  I prefer a bit of a wait and excellent food vs long wait and bad food.  Waiting isn't a reason to knock someone business."}
{"text":"I recently went there with a bunch of friends and found out that they just started all you can eat! We couldn't pass that up! For only $25 we got some huge slices of sashimi (limit 4 pieces of each fish!)  all of which were very fresh and good quality! The server we had was extremely nice and quick. The Samurai roll is awesome and I would come back here for sure!  The only con was on a few rolls they over sauce but I just smeared it off on the plate and it was fine."}
{"text":"Felt compelled to update my review for Kawaii. This used to be far down the top sushi places, but it is quickly rising. Not quite at the top but getting better. Great tasting rolls, fresh sushi and oh my goodness- the build your own hand rolls are to die for. We had spicy tuna in seaweed wrap with asparagus, cucumber, avocado, jalapeño, and then topped with crunch, tobiko and scallions. I've just died and gone to heaven. Areas for improvement: more costly than some of our other favorites, never have quail eggs, uni, or true masago."}
{"text":"Kelly and Team have the best dumplings and fried rice in the valley...keep up the great work Kawaii!"}
{"text":"Great little family owned Sushi and Chinese food restaurant. I really loved the décor and vibe. Its open and welcoming with lots of fun lighting, seating, and little flowers on each table. Plenty of bar top seating and dinning room seating.   It was a very busy Saturday night when we walked in at about 7:30 there were only 2 tables open. But as soon as we sat down we had great and prompt service. Started off with the Hot and Sour Soup. I loved that this soup was hot but not too hot to eat right away, lots of flavor and the prefect starter. We got 2 meals. One General Chaos Chicken, and the House Fried Rice. When they sat them down I knew we would be eating left over's for a few days, there was sooooo much food. You could definitely split a meal here. The Chicken was crispy, thin, lightly breaded and fried. I liked the sauce but thought it could use a little more flavor. The House Fried rice had big pieces of Shrimp, chicken, beef and pork, the rice was cooked perfectly. I don't have one bad thing to say about it.   I will definitely be coming back and hope that they can grow and expand through the valley. I wouldn't mind one a little closer to home."}
{"text":"We waited forever for anyone to even bring is water or acknowledge our presence. Even after we were seated by a hostess. Not very friendly staff and the sushi was subpar. Not very good. Will not return."}
{"text":"I'm no expert on sushi, but the rolls we got here were AMAZING!  Seriously so good.  My husband was leery of trying sushi at all but he did and agreed that this was delicious.  So, we'll most definitely be coming to Kawaii again.  Also excited to try some of the other stuff on their menu after all the good reviews I've read.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Always a great experience here.  Love the Sushi and the service is good.  The owner is on the floor working and does a great job.  Just wish I lived closer to visit more often!"}
{"text":"I used to drive by here almost every day and wanted to try this place for a long time.    So sad that I was disappointed.   I happened to drop by on lunch... had one of their lunch specials of two rolls and a miso soup for $9.  Miso is great.  I am not happy with my choice of rolls... and I can only assume the other rolls are similar in disappointment.  Let me start with, I know my sushi and I know what it's supposed to taste like.  When I go to a new place, I order something simple that really a place can't mess up easily but also has a lot of potential.  I do NOT eat my first rolls somewhere with the soy sauce.  I don't believe in hiding the flavor behind salt.  So I ordered a spicy salmon roll and a yellowtail scallion roll.    We'll start with the (not so) spicy salmon roll that I wasn't even sure was salmon.  It appeared to have been mutilated salmon, to the point where I questioned if it was tuna instead.  And it wasn't spicy AT ALL.  I'm no super spicy person, but I like a little bit and this had NOTHING.  It had this weird smokey taste in it, which I absolutely did NOT understand what it was and made it taste cheap, like something I would get from a grocery store off the shelf.  (which we all know those are terrible)  The rice was very very dry and stuck in my throat.   I seriously wanted my soy sauce at this point.  Look around... and I have no little trays to put my soy sauce in... and it was almost like they expected me to pour it over the top of the rolls?  No.  Not happening.  So I forced myself thru it... I was hungry.  Next roll... the yellowtail scallion roll.  At least I could tell what it was.  But it was so horribly bland... I could barely taste the scallions and there was nothing added to enhance the taste of the yellowtail.  Again, the rice was super dry and stuck to the roof of my mouth, making me seriously think about asking the waiter for a dish for my soy sauce.  But I have strict rules for my first sushi visits... and didn't.  Other notes: their iced green tea is VERY sweet.  I happen to like that.  I just wanted to let you all know.  And the ginger is PINK.  Nothing says cheap more than pink ginger.  Advice to any sushi chef/owner... slice your own ginger and store it in water.  It makes the hard core sushi eaters happy.   Service was good... no issues.  I sat at the bar, the sushi chef said hi and checked on me... as well as the server.  Things were served quickly... which there were only like 5 people in there so anything less would have been annoying.  The decor is kinda neat... I like it.  The stainless steel bar top I'm sure feels GREAT in the summer time, but startled me this winter. lol  That was cold! haha  So... service and decor gets a 2 star... but to me, the food is the most important and I was sadly disappointed."}
{"text":"We thought leaving San Antonio we would be saying goodbye to good seafood and sushi. Amazingly there is great sushi here! Makes us happy. I got the Phoenix Roll and it was great. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place was great! Excellent service, fresh and delicious! I had the pink lady roll and the kawaii roll - both superb! Such a great hole in the wall"}
{"text":"Great sushi and good service.  The staff acknowledged us right away and we tried some new sushi.  It was very good."}
{"text":"So happy they are in our neighborhood!  The lunch special is amazing.  The food is always excellent - sushi or hot dishes.  The staff is friendly and attentive. We are there a couple times a month."}
{"text":"Excellent, too bad many of my neighbors love it too, they were lined up outside waiting for a table"}
{"text":"We have been going here for Sushi since it opened. The other day we decided that we would try the Chinese food. OMG!!!! It was fantastic!!!"}
{"text":"I love this little neighborhood place. Fun music, fun vide, good service, good food, reasonable prices. Try the Phoenix role, it's amazing!"}
{"text":"Went here a couple weeks ago, and ultimately it was Adequate-Plus.  I would have ranked it a 4, but my sushi standards are freakishly high from my time traveling and living in Japan.  The fish was fresh, and the prices were reasonable.  Rolls were well made and beautifully displayed.  The Japanese say that you eat first with your eyes, then with your mouth and the chefs at Kawaii definitely mastered that.   Besides the standards, there were many creative options on the menu.    Service was good, someone was always available to help or refill our beverages but not to the point of smothering.    We would come back without hesitation."}
{"text":"I've tired this place a few times but tonight was not what I expected it to be. My review is based on tonight service and every time I order take out.   I played a to go order 30 min before they closed I get it I'm that annoying customer that waits till the last second.. no, I just happen to be getting off work and was really craving some sushi and an appetizer. In total I spent $28 I don't tip on to go orders Bc I don't feel like I have to since they aren't doing anything.   After I leave was excited to eat and both my sushi roll and appetizers sucked! I spent $28 and went down the trash I ordered their Mongolian  beef plate before and it was great but wanted sushi so paid double and didn't even eat"}
{"text":"Oh Kawaii, how I love you. Hands down the best Chinese I've had in AZ and I'm lucky enough that is stumbling distance from my house...which is a good thing because they have killer drinks and happy hour specials too ;)   Kelly, the owner, makes an effort to get to know all her regulars and does a great job making sure Kawaii provides a great dining experience.   I've never had anything here I didn't like, but my favorites are:  Beef lo mein Orange beef Salt and pepper chicken Egg drop soup (best I've had!) Cucumber salad (great dressing) Crab puffs Peach sake  I should also comment on the high quality of the food. Some Chinese restaurants serve meat that is the equivalent of chewing on a rubber bike tire but everything at Kawaii is fresh, well seasoned, and excellent quality.  I've got probably a dozen friends and family members hooked on this place. Me likey Kawaii!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in north Phoenix. We only moved here a few months ago and have been here a dozen times.  The service does tend to be a bit slow, but everyone there is so pleasant, you can forgive that.  The food is your standard sushi and Chinese food, but it's really well done. The sushi is fresh and the Chinese food isn't greasy.  Also, they have Happy hour, even on Sunday!"}
{"text":"Good, tasty sushi & other food items, horrible place if you're handicapped. Impossible to maneuver in a wheelchair. Wonder when ADA comes in and makes them remove some seating."}
{"text":"OK so, i am not a sushi fan, but the other Asian cuisine was good.  Not amazing, but good. I will say my kid LOVES the sushi here.    I had the Udon bowl, and tried the orange chicken.  If you are in the neighborhood, it is worth trying.  I would not travel a great distance to try this place out."}
{"text":"I went for lunch because its over by GCC north and I was starving!  I got the special which was 3 rolls and soup or salad for $11.  The waiter was very nice and good about refilling drinks but something was off with this sushi.  I don't think the ginger was fresh because it tasted funny and looked like the kind that comes out of a jar.  The rolls were loosley packed and fell apart way too easily.  I choose spicy california, eel alvocado, and tuna skins for my three rolls.  They filled me up but but again there was a strange taste in each of them that I'm not sure that I liked.  Overall if your starving this place will do but if you are a sushi snob you probably won't be impressed."}
{"text":"I heard that Kawaii was under new ownership and recently had a perfect Maricopa Health Inspection so I thought I could give Kawaii another try.  We ordered the most common of sushi to try that should be fresh.  A Salmon Surprise Roll and Sushi of Tuna and Yellowtail.  When the sushi came out I knew immediately  that this was not pristine fresh as it should be. (see close up of Yellowtail Photo)   Honestly I never had sushi anywhere that looked that bad including budget buffets.  I took a chance eating the sushi.  The sushi was put loosely together and most of the pieces fell apart when we ate them.   The tuna and yellowtail pieces weren't seasoned under the fish as they should be.  Really the worst tasting of the sushi was the salmon surprise roll. It was the only one that had an actual raw fish taste to it. I guess raw fish taste was the surprise.  None of the sushi really tasted fresh.   I only like fresh sushi.  This sushi I didn't like and is why some people won't eat sushi.  A while latter our stomachs ached but we didn't get sick.   If they didn't have any fresh fish the server should have suggested a stir fry to me.  BYE BYE KAWAII AND SAYONARA!  I WILL NOT BE BACK!"}
{"text":"So, we live in the middle of sprawl, in the far NW 'burbs.  The only real restaurants around us are the typical chain places... you know... the Chilis, the TGiFridays, that sort of thing. Fine if that's what you're into, but... we like things a little more interesting and unique than that.  So, with a great deal of surprise, a new restaurant by the name of \"Kawaii\" opens up next to our local Walmart grocery store. What? I figured that at best, we'd get some stupid chain fast food dealio.  So, last night, we decided to try Kawaii. Wowsa, the place was packed, and we managed to get a little booth in the corner.  Atmosphere: Good. A hybrid of Japanese tradition (wooden booth benches) and modern decor.  Staff: Nice folks, that seemed to be sincerely there to serve.  Food: Tasty!  My wife and I both ordered Bento boxes. Her: the tofu. Me, the shrimp. Both teriyaki. Our son ordered the Soba noodles, vegi style.   Salad - crisp and cold, with a nice ginger-mustardy dressing. Tasty and fresh.  Miso - Creamy flavor. Again goodly.  Tofu Bento - The tofu was cooked fabulously; crisp and chewy on the outside, buttery on the inside and served on stir-fried teriyaki vegis. The vegis were cooked right and good. 6 little Shumai were nice little bites. The California rolls of course were clearly far better than the ones served next door. Chewy rice and clearly fresh.  Shrimp Bento - Pretty much the same as above. The dish came with maybe a dozen medium shrimp... all good and peppery, with a nice brown teriyaki sauce.   Soba - Man this was great as well. Lots of vegetables, and soba that tasted like they may be making it there. It was really good, and while I dug my Bento, I think that I would have enjoyed the Soba just as much. Really tasty, my 6 year old son just kept eating it.  So, all really, really  great.  Downsides:  No kid's menu, no specific kid's offering. It was a little painful to order a $13 meal for our kid. But hey, I'm cheap.  Prices were pretty standard for this kind of food. It's not cheap food, but they're not gouging you for it either. I felt like I had a great meal, not a stab in the back.  When we go again, I'll let you know how it fared."}
{"text":"Me & my significant other stopped here tonight for sushi not knowing what to expect. We're new to the area & usually do Scottsdale when going out to eat, wanted something easy tonight & this was 3 mins from our home. We were so pleasantly surprised that such an awesome restaurant was right down the street. Great service not only from our server, but from the whole staff including food runners, bussers, & the hostess. The lettuce wraps were delicious & the sushi was too! Especially the spicy girl roll! We will be back for sure! Don't let the fact that it's next to Walmart put you off. This place is great for casual sushi & simple cocktails!"}
{"text":"I'm always on the lookout for a good Sushi place, this one opened up close to home and I wasn't sure what to think.  My wife and I went in for a lunch on a day we didn't have the 2 year old, and boy am I glad we didn't have her.  It's more traditional seating, open back booths, I think we would have trouble keeping the 2 year out of everyone else's space.  But the food was great, lunch was ideal, few customers, lower prices and we opted to try several new things.  I did the 3 Rolls Lunch Special which includes Miso Soup and salad, both of which were very good.  The list of selectable rolls was pretty short, but still good, I went with the traditional Spicy California, Shrimp Tempura and Spicy Tuna, all of which were very good.  My wife selected a Mongolian Beef Lunch Special, which I honestly didn't like and would not order again, typical poor selection of beef that is used, but he spices didn't taste good to me at all, so we'll be on the look out for other Bento boxes to get the next time.  Service was good, the waiter warmed up to use as we asked questions and everything went over very well."}
{"text":"This place has some pretty great service.  It seems that they all work as a team effort here to make sure everyone is taken care of and it works.  I came in on a Friday night with a full house and was very impressed with the service.  I ordered the spicy teriyaki chicken and it was also very good.  A little more sauce than I typically like but that's just personal preference.  Overall 5/5 keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Great local place!  Friendly and fast service with delicious sushi and very good orange chicken.  They also have great specials and a good happy hour menu.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Came here after a friend recommended it to me. Order a beer which came with a chipped glass and about a 2 inch crack. Chicken fried rice and orange chicken was ok but I've had better. Richie Rich roll was good. Apps were ok again I've had better. The salmon tartar took 20 minutes but was good. Overall experience was not that good. Restaurant wasn't even half full. It's Monday 5pm."}
{"text":"I go here once a week if not more. I am absolutely in love with this place! The service, the sushi (which is the best in the valley) and the atmosphere is just incredible. I HIGHLY recommend this place and can't say enough great things about Kawaii."}
{"text":"Great place to grab some sushi!  My wife and I eat here about 2 to 3 times a month and always have great service and fresh sushi.  There was a 1 month period of time where the sushi was not great about a year ago.  Since then we have been back so many times and the food and service has exceeded our expectations.  We have brought many friends and family in and they have enjoyed it as well.  Try the C-4 roll!"}
{"text":"Been here more times than can count... live very close.  They even know my kids by name.  Never had a bad experience here. The chefs do an awesome job at preparation and presentation. The plates with rolls always come out looking like a high end restaurant. We all have our favorites - I don't know what they are called, but they are good ;) Try a few different rolls and you will see what I mean - all good.  The server staff is just the best - awesomely attentive, interacting, and fun to talk to!  Pricing is on par with other Japanese area restaurants - it is not a cheap meal, but well worth the price paid!"}
{"text":"We went for lunch and arrived at 1:15pm.  One man at a table, one at the sushi bar just leaving.  While we were there, two girls came in, two guys came to the bar and one solo at the window.  So the crowd was pretty sparse. First - the service was fine.  The young lady had a rough time with English, but she really tried.  The two males were better on English.  And all of them checked on us every once in a while. The food was good...certainly not great.  It was obviously fresh.  I had the three rolls for $11 special, Jo had a Chicken Teriyaki Special for $11.  Chicken was a little on the dry side - she would have preferred dark meat.  My rolls were good and the price was fine. Their techno-pop music seemed way out of place, especially when they had the US Hockey Team on one TV. All in all, I'll go back.  But, do note that all the \"Happy Hour Specials\" require you to buy a beer or sake.  One drink for every special you order.  Ehhhhhh"}
{"text":"Always enjoy our experience here. We like having a big menu to choose from. The staff is friendly and helpful. The restaurant is always clean and welcoming. The food is always very good. I would say 5 stars however some of the rolls are on the pricey side. But you most certainly get what you pay for. It is quality food!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place. Of all the sushi places I've eaten in my life this is the best. I recently moved to Chandler with my fiance and we still make the almost hour long drive to eat at Kawaii. Seriously I've had dreams about their Chinese pan fried dumplings. The staff is always so nice and friendly, it's a refreshing change to eat somewhere that the owner actually cares that you are having the best possible experience."}
{"text":"This piss poor establishment was a referral to by a fellow Realtor. We wanted to sit at the sushi bar, it was happy hour until 7, and we got there about 5:30. It was full of screaming children and families and we weren't allowed to sit on either end of the sushi bar because you couldn't see the sushi in order to feel like you were sitting at a sushi bar. So we waited, they left our seats dirty for quite some time before seating us and cleaning it in the order for us to sit. Once we were seated, we ordered edemame, and a couple of appetizers, but, we didn't get our edemame until three orders later which should have come first. Our server was great,  he was young , new, and he was smart and he understood our issues with the service, but he was only our server and not the Cook or preparer. We watched the sushi chefs like you do ordinarily at a sushi bar,  which is really a fun thing to do, if it's a good sushi bar, but one of the sushi preparers, I wouldn't  even call him a sushi chef now, named Tony, who was new, dropped a piece of tuna wrapped around some rice on the floor and he picked it up off the floor with his gloves and he put it back on the counter and when he knew that I knew he did that he put it to one side. GROSS! I told our server that and he said he would tell the manager, nobody ever came out to talk to us and we waited a long time for our food, which I didn't want to eat after seeing that. After about 30 minutes Kelly, who claimed she was the manager,  finally came out and I asked what the man's name was. She said, Tony, i asked what his real name was, and she said, Tony.  The manager, Kelly, did not credit our bill for anything and she didn't even really care that that happened. If you want a good sushi bar go to Moira on Adams, in downtown Phx,  it's awesome and it's clean. This place is awful and disgusting and dirty and none of the sushi chefs say hello to you.  They are not Japanese sushi chefs and this place is filthy dirty disgusting.  The health department needs to step in. I'm never going back that's disgusting gross. DON'T  EVER STEP FOOT IN THIS FILTHY PLACE! BUYER BEWARE, EATING HERE WILL COST YOU!"}
{"text":"We have come here for years, it has always been good but since Kelly has taken ownership it is a completely different experience.  Better seating configuration for families, better roll and Chinese food selection.  Our kids never flinch when we ask where they would like to go to dinner, Kawaii every time.  Love having Kawaii close by"}
{"text":"Finally a good quality sushi restaurant in this area.  Everything we ordered here tasted great. I love love their shrimp fried rice, big O, sashimi tuna.  My husband loves their wonton soup and California rolls."}
{"text":"We should have left immediately when we walked in and heard the only people waiting at the entry say they couldn't wait any longer for their take-out food...they were in danger of missing their movie.  But this used to be a really good restaurant, so we stayed.  Under new management or ownership now.    We waited and waited and waited for our food.  Service was poor.  Others came in after us and were served before us.  We noticed that diners who were familiar to the new management were served first and given priority service.  The food was at least 50% more expensive than in the past and the food was not nearly as good.  My son ordered Mongolian beef, and he couldn't chew the beef.  My Kung pao shrimp was awful. I won't be back."}
{"text":"BEST SUSHI SPOT IN THE VALLEY, great staff (very good looking might I add ) and the food is to die for. 10/10 would recommend"}
{"text":"Great spot, good people, affordable prices. Plus they play good music. The owner is super friendly, always making my friends and I feel at home. Make sure you're sat in Morgan's section, she's very accommodating. Not once have I had a bad experience here. Check it out!"}
{"text":"We just flew in from San Diego and needed to eat dinner late.  Fortunately, our plane had wifi and I was able to consult Yelp.  Kawaii had good reviews and was close to where we were ultimately going to end up for the evening.    We arrived at about 9:15 and entered the very clean well laid out space of Kawaii. We had our choice of locations and found one within view of the Hockey playoffs on TV.  Excellent.  They had a very nice and affordable selection of Sake. The waitress was super friendly and let us know about the specials and the menu.    We chose Gyoza and Crab Rangoon as our appetizers.  They were on $.99 special with the order of a sake or beer.  We also ordered the Chicken Yakitori.    The Chicken Yakitori was our favorite.  Excellent flavor and a decent size portion.  I enjoyed both the Gyoza and Crab Rangoon as well.  All of the appetizers came out fast and hot.  Perfect.    Ordering too much food as I often do, we selected the Happy Valley Roll, Cucumber Naruto roll and the Triple Sashimi (3 pieces each of salmon, tuna and yellowtail).  Excellent rolls and super large fresh portions of Sashimi.  The Naruto roll doesn't have rice.  So, it was a very nice complement to both the Happy Valley Roll (Tuna, Avocado, Jalapeno, Topped w/White Tuna And Salmon) and the Sashimi.  Finally, we ordered the spicy tuna jalapeno appetizer.  This had a very unique peppery flavor with a burst of heat that made both of us go Wow.  This is good.    Thank you for a great meal!    We will be back!"}
{"text":"I come here all the time. Service is fast and friendly always! They always have really good deals. They have soooo many types of rolls so you can never get bored and they are super good about special orders (I love to add cream cheese to my roll if it doesn't have it, and I don't care for the spicy mayo) and I have never had a mistake with my special orders. Great spot for a date or just hanging out for friends. I love this place and I am so lucky that it is less than a mile away from me!!!"}
{"text":"Second visit in a week, I love the passion of the new owners, food is fantastic, salt and pepper shrimp was a perfect surprise and ca berne with sushi, love the suggestion, we  will be back........ soon."}
{"text":"The menu features a wide range of Japanese favorites. I enjoyed the clear soup with mushrooms and scallions and shrimp and scallop skewer appetizer, a wonderful start to a meal of sushi.  The sushi menu offered many standards and creative choices. My colleague had sushi rolls, which they did not skimp on the meat and fillings. He also had some tempura, the servings of which are large, light and tasty.  I opted out for sushi and tried their sashimi instead.  I had Maguro (Tuna), Salmon, Hamachi (Yellow Tail), Mckajiki (Sword Fish) and Tako (Octopus).  It was all very good.   I'm looking forward to my next trip to try something different.  This is a great place for lunch at $11 for 3 rolls, soup and salad."}
{"text":"Let's start by admitting that I worked in two different upscale sushi restaurants over the course of the last year and a half. I don't pretend to love sushi but my boyfriend is a seafood aficionado and I'm skilled at finding good places on Yelp.   Our server Gabriella on the sushi bar was warm, friendly and didn't miss a single step! Quick to greet us, remembered every single modification, and smiled the entire time. I will only be back on her shift, she is the reason we had such a great experience.   First course was garlic edamame and egg drop soup, both awesome. We scarfed them down and before we knew it our Phoenix Roll and Rocky Road Roll (?) were there and we quickly gobbled those up too. I will be back for lunch, happy hour, dinner, anytime anyone suggests sushi...I am now a fan thanks to this place.   Already dreaming about our next visit :) :) :)"}
{"text":"Great service, great atmosphere, great sushi. Ordered a bunch of sashimi, it was well cut and  fresh"}
{"text":"I have been here several times and after my last visit yesterday I will never go back.  The service is horrible!  We got to the restaurant at about 4:30 and didn't get served until almost 6:00.  We were one of three tables.    The quality of the food was terrible and the meal was  way over priced.   The owner has no customer service skills and wants to blame the horrible service on her new staff.    For years this was the only sushi restaurant in the area and now with so many other choices it's time for Kawaii to go bye bye."}
{"text":"Website offers happy hour prices for to-go food.    Called and specifically asked if happy hour specials apply for take out...yes says the male order taker.  Ordered 3 different sushi items per the happy hour.  Have had their sushi to go and it has been great.  New owner trying hard to make a difference.   Poor owner had to engage a customer who melted down about $3.00 in noodles.  Lighten up noodle lady."}
{"text":"While not stellar, this is a good solid, high quality sushi joint.  It's near us so we've been here quite a lot.  Service is always friendly and quick, and they have good selections of special rolls along with the basics.  The prices are on the low side, and they always give you one free standard roll with any specialty roll you order.  Appetizers are inexpensive and tasty."}
{"text":"My sister got me a shrimp tempora roll from there, and i was very disappointed. It looked like they just threw it together and spent no time on it and the insides did not taste fresh. They put lettuce in the roll which i thought was weird but it did not taste pleasant at all. Yen Sushi and Sake Bar is way better."}
{"text":"What a gem of a place.  The best food , great service and very reasonable prices. If your looking for a great place to relax eat and have a drink, this place is for you."}
{"text":"Love this little spot for fresh sushi and Chinese cuisine is the best in the area- try their orange chicken!!  I wish they offered more sushi specials because it's is a little on the pricey side."}
{"text":"First off I have to start off saying that we came here because of a coupon we bought off one of the many coupon sites out there. We were very happy we did and will certainly be back. We started off with the garlic edamame and I think it was the best garlic edamame that I have ever had. It had actual specs of garlic throughout and they tasted like they were almost cooked in butter as well as the garlic. Hubby and I couldn't eat them fast enough and were probably secretly racing each other to see who could eat the most! When we were almost finished with those our order of the House Special Pan Fried Noodles arrived. We were both amazed at the quantity and thought for sure there was no way we would be able to eat it all. The flavor was right on and they did not skimp on the protein at all. Plenty of chicken, pork, and shrimp through out. My only negative is the pork was a tad chewy and not as flavorful as it could've been. We really had to pace ourselves and not eat too much of it however because we still had our sushi coming out. The first to arrive was the Scorpion Roll.   It turned out to be a wonderful roll and the sauce they served it on really accentuated the flavors of the sushi. Shortly after it arrived our Sashimi platter was served. This is what I had been looking forward to and I was not disappointed! The pieces of fish were very large and thick and required each to be cut into two bites when eating. We were very impressed with the freshness and quality of it. I had contemplated trying one of their desserts; however, neither one of us could even think about finishing the rest of our pan fried noodle entrée, let alone ordering dessert. We did see that one has to get here early as the place filled up very quickly once we were sat down. And several people waiting for tables upon our leaving. Both hubby and I really enjoyed our meal and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in last weekend and had the pink lady roll and the Las Vegas roll. The pink lady roll was very cool because the seaweed was dyed pink and I would love to figure out how they did that and it was delicious!! The Las Vegas roll is something I order whenever a sushi place has it and this was the best one I've had yet!"}
{"text":"What an amazing place for a great Asian lunch at a phenomenal price!  it is close to home so I have taken a variety of friends to lunch here more than a dozen times and have never been disappointed.  The service is friendly and quick and the food is consistently fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Love this place best Chinese food I have  found. Crab puffs are amazing and they run $30 for $15 often on Local Flavor deals."}
{"text":"This was pretty good sushi! I liked the fact that you can get buy one, get one free on the rolls during most of their business hours. $15 for 2 rolls isn't bad. Wished mine had more sauce but I might have chosen the wrong ones. Will try again!"}
{"text":"So my husband and I had a once in a lifetime (seems like forever with kiddos) opportunity to do a date night last night. We saw this place had great reviews and decided to drive 30 minutes to try it out. We were excited!  We got there and was seated fairly early but our server took a while to even acknowledge us and ask for drinks.  Anyway, we ordered a bunch of food but I would say my favorite was the calamari. We ordered the Laguna roll, big mistake. It was all fake crab and just really underwhelming. Our server made a mistake and gave us a Philadelphia roll, which we clearly didn't order, but we took it anyway and paid for.   We had two main courses, a chicken dish and a mix seafood dish. What's really odd is that they taste the same.  Dishes were meh yet they were on the pricey side. Was really disappointed with the rolls we got."}
{"text":"This place is a fun little sushi place hidden in mini mall next to a Wal-Mart corner store.  Their recent Lightning Bug roll special has become a favorite.  It is sweet, spicy, and completely delicious.  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We had a Groupon and wanted sushi.  Your servant recognized us. We decided on the Fantastic and the Cardinal roll.  the Fantastic has Salmon, tuna, and yellowtail inside and topped with spicy scallop. The cardinal has spicy tuna and mango on the inside and topped with shrimp, tuna and tobiko. Both were delicious.  We always enjoy our on spot freshest of fresh sushi.    A nice restaurant and the owner, Kelly is so friendly.  Our friends frequent often and staff not only remember them but also remember orders.  Nice!  We ordered the Samurai and tuna roll.  Delicious and fast service.  Highly recommend although going back home thru the roundabout circles is a pain that we are not use to. Plenty of parking and competitive prices.  ."}
{"text":"I came in for date night on Thursday and the restaurant was very busy. Our server Morgan was amazing and so kind! Although the wait was a little long, the food was delicious, restaurant was clean and service was wonderful. Thank you for a great experience!"}
{"text":"I tried Kawaii twice before they were taken over by new management and I can honestly say that the food was much better under the last owner.   We ordered about $60 worth of food including sushi. The quality of the food was very poor. The rice was dry. The chicken tasted a bit old. My sushi roll was tiny and poorly put together.  I live a block away from this place but I am willing to make the 20 min drive to any other sushi restaurant. Wasn't worth the money, time or calories. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Just ordered thru their online ordering system, at 7:04 & said it was gona be $37. I got there at 7:20, only to find out that the total is $46.75 . Well this and this change and our online menu isn't updated, well that's no fair to me is what I thought but instead I just said oh okay. Then waited for 20more minutes and the guy had came over to me and said it'll be 5-10minutes can I offer you something to drink I said \"no why is it gona take longer when I ordered my food at 7, it's been 40 minutes.\" He said he'll go back and check. Meanwhile I'm sitting there thinking they probably started making my food when I got there, and plus they should have eaten up the difference in price, it wasn't my fault their online menu isn't up to date with their \"new menu\" in the resturant! And then I stood back up waiting by the desk only to have some lady who works there come over to me and ask can I help you, I said \"yes I wana know why it's taking 45 mins to make my food when these people right here just got here 10 mins ago and already have their food.\" She said they only have 1 sushi chef working and we are almost full and we are busy. I'm like \"it's never taken 45 mins,plus I see 2 sushi chefs working.. (Smh) and we come here all the time. I'm really upset that you are being so rude, & arguing with me, what are you gona do abt this.\"Again she said \"Im trying to explain why .. We're expanding and more busy\". And than finally my food came out by another lady - 50mins later!! I just was so hungry and upset that I just grabbed my bags and said I'm never coming back here. I'm upset because I love their food but HATE THEIR \"new\" SERVICE!  If they are expanding they better pick up their pace!   Their food is 4/5 star, new service blows !"}
{"text":"Fricken amazing sushi!! My mom and I went during happy hour and ordered a variety of sushi and loved every one of them! The \"spicy salmon\" is not very spicy at all, which we were skeptical of at first because we didn't want it to be too hot. The service was good, my water glass was full the whole time. The server came back to check on us a few times but not too much to where it was annoying. It is nice and clean and quiet inside. I would for SURE go back here!"}
{"text":"I love the sushi bar and especially sitting outside on the patio that is dog friendly. They've a huge selection of fresh sushi very tasty and artfully done"}
{"text":"I'm new to Arizona.....I spent most my time in Boston,Ma   I love sushi and had it from China, Hong Kong,Taiwan,Japan ,Korea and others  I was told to try \" KAWAII \" in Glendale,AZ    The fish was  \" sushi grade \" so fresh it was wonderful  I ate alone so I couldn't try too much  I started with a  Tsukiji roll ,salmon,tuna,and yellow tail with seared salmon in a spicy mayo, nicely rolled and tight. The sushi had flavor in the different componets of this roll  I ended my day with a  Hawaiian roll with tempura shrimp,avocado,mango, with seared tuna ....they took their time to create a \" piece of art \" and it was fantastic also , I'm not sure which one I liked better ?  It was definitely a well trained restaurant staff & the owner (Kelly )  was very personable and makes you feel right at home   I will come back very soon"}
{"text":"We have been to Kawaii lots of times. Both for dinner service and take-out. The sushi is pretty good quality. We have always had good service too. I'm confused about the negative comments on here. My husband is Japanese and grew up in Hawaii. This is both of our go-to place for sushi."}
{"text":"Went here this evening to celebrate Mother's Day for Mom.  This is probably my 3rd time here, but my first time writing a review on Yelp.  It is a convenient location, ample parking and the interior is clean.  We were seated right away despite not having any reservation which I was surprised about given it was the Saturday before Mother's Day.  The decor is Japanese / Asian-inspired as you can imagine and tastefully done.    We started with their Stayce Roll which is a fairly good-sized roll.  The interior of the roll has mango, avocado & sake (salmon).  On top of the roll is a slab of smoked salmon.  This was my first time trying this roll and it was nothing short of delicious!  The raw salmon inside of the roll was fresh, the smoked salmon on top of the roll was awesome and the mango really added a level of depth that I'm not sure I've ever eaten with sushi.   Definitely one of my new favorite sushi rolls.  Their Tuna Amazing roll is another one of my favorites which I've had here before.  I've not yet had the opportunity to try many sushi spots in Arizona thus far, but Kawaii does sushi very well, in my opinion.    Here's where things are a bit different at Kawaii.  You've just eaten sushi, right?  But when you flip through the menu - you won't find many other Japanese inspired dishes (tempura, bento boxes, gyudon, etc, etc).  In fact, the bulk of their entrees are Americanized-Chinese dishes (orange chicken, sesame chicken, beef broccoli, general tso's, etc, etc.)  I think the only other Japanese inspired entree I spotted on the menu was the udon bowl.  For some reason, that just seems strange to me, but it seems to work for them.  i.e., if I wanted Chinese food, I wouldn't go to a sushi joint.  If I wanted sushi, I wouldn't go Panda Express.  Again, it's not necessarily a bad thing - it's just different for a sushi spot.  For an entree, I got the Hong Kong Pan Fried Noodles (House Special).  Not as good as the sushi, but it was a fairly good portion of food and everything was fresh and hot.  It was a little pricey (almost $15) for a fairly simple Chinese dish.  Their House Special noodle dish consists of chicken, BBQ pork & shrimp.  Of course, I only got 2-3 shrimp and the rest of the dish is fairly saturated with a lot of broccoli, a lot of water chestnuts, an overabundance of carrots and the noodles.  Scattered in between the vegetables and noodles were a few pieces of pork and some chicken.  There wasn't a lot of gravy in the dish which you would normally utilize to pour over your pan-fried noodles to soften them up.  I'm Asian and this is how my Mom always made it.  As a result of this, my dish remained fairly crunchy because of the lack of gravy and the fact that I don't like my dinner entrees to be described as crunchy.  I will have to try something else next time I go.  Don't get me wrong.  It certainly wasn't horrible.  In fact, I ate the whole thing.  I would just opt to get something different next time.  In the meantime, I think Kawaii is a great spot for sushi!  They appear to have a solid social media following on Yelp & Facebook.  The employees are friendly and the atmosphere is chill & laid back without being terribly loud or overbearing."}
{"text":"the food was good, but the service was not good...no one came to Ask about drink refills, the check took forever..thw experience was certainly not worth a repeat...next time it's squid ink!"}
{"text":"Soooo... I initially ordered potstickers. I know she heard me because she questioned which size I wanted? Which confused me because I wasn't aware that there were any other option of size.   Well we got all our food and she randomly brought those crab wontons to our table and we didn't eat it at first. We assumed it was complimentary to some of our lunch orders. I asked her, does this come with our meals? And she said yes. She also brought out more of our orders and she said that my golden California roll and potstickers should be out. Okay....   Wrong. Potstickers never came out. She charged us for the crab wontons. Which doesn't even sound like potstickers but whatever. I don't think I'll be coming anytime soon.   Another problem!! 3/4 of us ordered sushi and only one of us got a side of wasabi and ginger. We asked for some for my mom and she said you guys can split this one. We had to ask again for extra ginger and she finally gave it to us.   It's 2 stars because I enjoyed the golden California roll and the pan fried noodles. But wow please enforce customer service. There were only 3 tables there including us! I'm sure there would be more customers, if the servers actually were attentive."}
{"text":"Came here for my surprise graduation celebration! My boyfriend had originally made reservations for 9, but had to change it last minute to 18 people. They were very accommodating!   The people taking care of us were very nice and patient. There were many sushi roll options, and with their happy hour, we were able to get a specialty roll and regular roll for around $10-$12. The sushi was the perfect size, perfectly cut, and looked so cute and yummy! And it was!   The bill came, and as a frequent sushi eater, I thought the bill would be very big...but it wasn't. Great service, great sushi, at a great price?! What?!  But most importantly...I went in craving for some Tempura green tea ice cream!! Which they have!! But I didn't end up getting that...because they gave me a chocolate tempura ice cream for my graduation!! So nice of them!  Was it the best sushi? It could be better. But with the good food, service, and price, this place is awesome! All in all, our group had a wonderful time! Thank you Kawaii!"}
{"text":"This place has AMAZING food. We had the general tso chicken  and the fried rice with chicken, BBQ pork and shrimp. So so so good. I didn't get to try the sushi because I'm pregnant but I will definitely be back in a few months for that because it looked phenomenal!!! It was packed and super small inside so I'd recommend making a reservation if you're planning on going during reg dinner hours but if you don't it's still worth waiting for :) I almost took one star off because their iced tea was pretty gross but the food more than makes up for that   Update: I have had my baby and tried the sushi and it was great too"}
{"text":"Unbelievable!! Horrible! If your looking for poor quality chicken and tasteless shrimp that were previously Frozen for $$..then eat here. Kung Pao filled with mostly chopped veggies and nuts..6 shrimp. Chicken was over fried with tiny greasy pieces. Nasty!! The shrimp in the $5 tacos at Rubios have better quality for sure! Pei Wei any day over this cheaply prepared food. Never go back!!! Cutting corners and greed."}
{"text":"I stopped in for take-out on a Thursday night. The place was packed! I ordered the cashew chicken with brown rice. The portion size was huge (three meals worth). It was delicious, even when reheated at home. The chicken was very good quality and the veggies were super fresh and tasty!  It was packaged in a great reusable and microwaveable container. I was impressed from start to finish. I am looking forward to having their cashew chicken again!!"}
{"text":"Owner is great-and the sushi is fantastic!  Best place I have found anywhere near the north side (including and especially the fancy places).  Great food and good prices."}
{"text":"Not fresh. Wife and I agreed that there was something very dry and bland about the pieces of yellow tail and salmon we had as sashimi. They tasted the same which has never happened to us. We were originally excited about a place so close to our home but we're saddened after our first visit. Perhaps a bad night? Either way we don't plan on returning. Not worth risking another bad experience. It's sushi afterall!  ;)"}
{"text":"We have eaten at your establishment ever week since it opened, your sushi is fresh & very good however because of your mangers attitude & unprofessionalism we will not be back!  She has no class & doesn't care wether you are loosing customers or not!  We are a handicap family who adopted special needs twins, I have cancer & so I sent my autistic teen in to pick up a to go order, when she presented the manager with her Groupon she said your not using that for to go, my daughter explained that we are unable to come in because of disabilities & cancer the manger was rude & said that's not her problem. My daughter pleaded with her to understand, to which the manager responded Your not using it! My daughter called me in tears, me too weak to do anything about it! We cancelled our order & are contacting Groupon! Bad reviews will be everywhere! Is this country were we are all suppose to be protected & understood your manager made us feel like we don't matter!"}
{"text":"If you want to eat some good sushi without a big crowd, check out Kawaii.  I've been about 25 times now (I live very close).  I always get a saki bomber becuase then you can have an appetizer for only $1.  Right now, when you buy a specialty roll, you get a regular roll for free.  I haven't had a roll there I didn't like and I usually finish a beer before I can decide what to get.  Besides the sushi, I get the Yaki Udon.  It's great.  It will be even better once the temperature gets cooler.  For dessert, you've got to try the fried green tea ice cream!  It's making my mouth water just thinking about it!  The service is good too but don't be surprised to walk in and catch a some of the staff just watching TV.  It's probobly because you're the only customer there.    See ya there!"}
{"text":"Very good sushi and rolls! Had the New York roll and it was amazing. Also try the orange chicken. It's the best in the north side."}
{"text":"This place has been here a couple of years but keeps improving.   The wait staff is quick and friendly and the happy hour specials (which seen to run all say) are great deals. My current favorites include the Kawaii roll, spicy crunchy yellow tail, spicy California roll, ninja roll, and the hamachi sushi. However, they have a wide menu and we have always enjoyed it when we strayed from our regulars.    Kelley is the hostess most times we are here and she has routinely gone above and beyond for customers. Once, bringing a niece who was unsure of sushi, she offerred anime-style stickers to our neice. It was a big hit and really put a new food adventure for a 12 year old in a fun and positive light.   Don't miss this place, it is awesome!"}
{"text":"Kelly and her staff are friendly and attentive!  When you come here you feel like family. It's unlike anything I ever experienced.  If you go often they take the time to get to know you!  The sushi is amazing, the hot food is wonderful according to my family (I only ever have gotten sushi!)  Going to kawaii isn't just food... it's an enjoyable experience"}
{"text":"This is the best sushi place in the neighborhood, great place to sit down and eat or call it in and pick it up."}
{"text":"An old friend of mine stopped by Kawaii years ago because he had a craving for some sushi to go. Despite living within minutes of the restaurant, I've always dismissed it as being just that. A sushi restaurant. And since I'm not a fan of fish in any form, I've never felt the urge to go back.  However, after passing it one day during a routine trip to Wal-Mart, my girlfriend inquired about why we've never visited them. After looking on Yelp and studying their pictures, I realized that I was completely mistaken by my initial assumption. Kawaii does indeed serve sushi, but the overall menu itself is more of an Asian fusion style that serves a combination of different dishes, appearing to focus heavily on a lot of Chinese favorites.  With that said, we swung by here on a very crowded Friday night. Far more crowded than I would have expected for this area. We ordered some fried gyoza to start, which ended up being quite good. Playing it safe as newcomers, I ordered the orange chicken while my girlfriend ordered the chow mein. We also opted for a side of fried rice with beef.  Honestly, I was pretty impressed with what was offered here. My girlfriend enjoyed her chow mein, while the fried rice was done just right. My orange chicken was good, tasting less processed than what has sadly become the \"norm\" these days. Although it wasn't perfect, as pieces ranged from deliciously crispy to annoyingly chewy throughout. I'm not so sure what that was about.   This minor gripe aside, service was handled well given the crowd and it's nice to see that there's a place in my (mostly) dull neighborhood actually doing well for itself.  We fully intend to go back and do some exploring in the future.  Check them out!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing. The food is done to perfection the vegetables were cooked just right and seasoned with the right amount of flavor. The sushi was amazing and they have a good knowledge of people with food allergies. Kelly was friendly and served with a smile. She was patient with my food allergies and made this a pleasant experience. Highly recommend to anyone seeking great food and great service."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times with our family.  This usually consists of myself, my husband, my 2-year-old, my 6-year-old, and my in-laws.  There isn't anything really that kid friendly on the menu, but they recommended a friend chicken cutlet that they cut up like chicken fingers.  The kids loved it.  Our sushi is always presented very well.  They cut carrots to look like birds.  I've never seen anything like it.  My kids were amazed.  We had to take the carrot birds home and put them in the refrigerator.  The sushi tasted really good.  We ordered a lot of sushi, but finished it between the four adults.  It was so good.  My father in law said the sushimi he ordered was really good.  I had hot sake, and my husband prefers the cold.  Both were really good.  It isn't the most kid friendly, but they do have high chairs available, and the wait staff is very patient.  Our service was good, because all of the waiters and waitresses just seem to work together.  No one is only responsible for their tables, we had drinks filled by whoever walked by.  Everyone seemed to be big on checking every table they walked by to make sure customers were pleased.  It has really good ambiance (in the evening) especially for a strip mall sushi place.  I was really pleasantly surprised.  If nothing else, it's worth coming here for presentation.  I'm really disappointed I didn't have my camera to photograph the way they plated our sushi."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible horrible! My friend had told me about this restaurant, and really hyped it up so I went in with very high hopes. We went in on a Friday evenining so I knew it would be busy, but this was just ridiculous. We got the crab puffs, dumplings and sushi. The crab puffs had no crab in the middle, the tempura sushi was smooshy and under cooked and the dumplings seemed microwaved and just fell right apart when I put my fork in them. I was so disappointed with everything and the manager not only was rude, but our bill arrived and they still charged us for everything we didn't eat!! And also not the mention everything is way over priced! Will not be going back, save the money and go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi, great service with fair prices. Nice atmosphere, has the typical Asian flare but with a modern edge. We most definitely will be back."}
{"text":"This Asian restaurant, originally noted for its varied and excellent sushi selections, has expanded in the last several years to include a general Chinese food menu. Not being an aficionado of raw fish, I haven't tried the sushi; but I can comment on the Chinese food.  Their Chinese food is first-rate, and after probably three dozen visits over the course of several years, I can report that the quality has been mostly consistent. Kelly, the owner, goes out of her way to accommodate special dietary needs. They make the dishes with gluten-free soy sauce on request at no extra charge. They'll make certain substitutions within reason (say, omitting one vegetable and including a little bit more of another). And they serve brown rice as well as white. They don't use MSG as a rule, but as some store mixtures of preliminary sauce mixes already contain it, ask first.  The food is fresh and cooked to order. One time, a dish came to the table not prepared as I'd requested. They removed it when I brought it to their attention and served the correctly prepared one.  The chow fun is excellent. Anything with curry sauce is good, although if you don't like it too hot you can tell them to go easy on the hot peppers. The beef is outstanding and the shrimp are large. One of the best dishes is their spicy eggplant--flavorful, rich, and filling. The large size is a good value. I always end up taking some home with me and putting just a little bit into all of the veggie dishes I eat for days afterward, that's how rich it is.  You can't go wrong with this restaurant. I am almost fanatically picky about my food, and this is just about the only place I go to when I eat out. So if you love Chinese (or sushi--my sushi-eating friends rave about this place!), give it a try."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since this place had opened as I find the sushi to be much better quality and size than some of the other more popular and trendy sushi houses. The sushi comes out in good sized portions and is always great tasting.   Recently the establishment changed ownership and a few things have changed, but for the better. The sushi is still amazing but the food items on the menu have had the recipes tweaked and it's quite amazing. My current favorite is the pork fried rice.   The new staff is very welcoming and friendly. The main hostess (Kelly) is very nice and sweet and always tells me the new items or additions they are implementing. Not sure if they have put it on the menu yet but they have some dumplings that are really good, I like the pan fried dumplings a lot. If they are not on the menu, just ask for them and they will bring me out. Steamed or pan fried, I prefer the pan fried.   By far my favorite hole in the wall sushi joint . Much better than the over prices trendy joints."}
{"text":"We have been here several times and probably would not have came back if it wasn't for the convenient location.    Came here last night an hour before closing.  Ordered 2 Sake and 4 different types of rolls.  Wasn't too filling so we ordered more sake and 2 more rolls.  Kinda hit the spot but also hit the wallet harder to feel full.  Sushi was pretty tasty.  The server was great.  He accommodated us even after we shut the place down and then some.  So he gets  four stars."}
{"text":"EXPENSIVE!   $20.00 for one person, no alcoholic beverages,  at lunch.  There are so many other great sushi restaurants that cost less. One of there servers kept playing with his hair while walking around the restaurant,  Gross!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing and the customer service superb!  They remembered my name on my second visit. I've never had that happen before."}
{"text":"Had basic Chinese food - large portions with reasonable prices.   Owner and waiters are awesome.    Very knowledgeable of menu and food - rare these days.  Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"just ok, not good not bad,.  dont think i'd return."}
{"text":"Myself and my family eat here on a regular basis, one of the things that we enjoy most is how the owner Kelly takes the time to get to know her customers. She not only knows our family but all of our friends who come in as well. We love the MAJOR improvements that Kelly has made since she bought the place. I have read a couple of the negative reviews on here and all I can say is....They must of had a bad day prior to coming into Kawaii. Also, everyone has an off day at some point.  Kelly...keep your head up! The food is great, people are great and prices are AWESOME! i love how you continue to look for ways to improve your place. We are customers for life!"}
{"text":"Such a great little local spot in the northwest valley. Sushi is excellent, food is great and the service rocks. Ask for \"G\", she's the best waitress on the planet. They even have allergy friendly alternatives for a lot of their cooked food entrees. Can't go wrong with Kawaii."}
{"text":"This review is solely on the customer service, and our take out orders.  My family eats here every few weeks, and has always loved the food and the atmosphere.  The last 2 weekends we have ordered takeout, and both times, our order has been wrong.  Both times, we were told our order would be ready in 20 minutes.  My husband would arrive to pick up the food, and it would be wrong.  He'd have to wait another 20 minutes for the right food.  Even when he got home, they made the wrong dish spicy .. and it was for my son.  He couldn't eat it.  The staff would apologize, but that's all.  When my husband called, the girl that answered the phone said she'd have the manager call me, I never received a phone call.  That is horrible customer service.  Sure, the food is great, when it's right.  But if you can't make it right, and make sure your customer is taken care of, why am I going to give you my money.  There's plenty of other sushi places that would treat me better, especially when I'm a regular there."}
{"text":"The service and food is wonderful,  this restaurant hires local high school kids as hostess and busying staff and the wait staff s always kind and attentive. We have tried many local Sushi restaurants and this one is one of the very best."}
{"text":"I have eaten a lot of Sushi but this place is by far THE best!!! The presentation  Great service and super friendly staff!!! The fresh Wasabi is the bomb!!!"}
{"text":"Everything here is great, especially the sushi. Every staff member you encounter will greet you with a smile. Big fan of the place and grateful to have them in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"The 1 star is only for the friendliness of the workers and for the lunch special PRICE.  I've been eating sushi at different locations for 2 years now, at least 1-2 times a week. I decided to try this place yesterday because my friend recommended it to me (she's not a huge sushi lover though).   The sushi rolls are disgusting and the raw fish (I tried salmon) is mediocre at best. The raw fish is not good quality raw fish. The phoenix roll (~12$) was one of the most disgusting rolls I've ever eaten. The ingredients they put together for that roll did not blend well together.. in all honesty, it sort of had a 'artificial strawberry' flavor aftertaste. I tried another roll (I think it was called 'Salmon Dynamite' or something like that... and it was ehhh, ok... the raw fish turned me off because of the poor quality.  I didn't try the lunch special, but the price was on the cheaper side (3 small rolls for $12). However, my friend ordered the lunch special and said the rolls were on the smaller side. She didn't comment on the taste.  I DO NOT recommend this place FOR SUSHI. Utterly disgusting."}
{"text":"1st Time here and very impressed. It's a great blend of Japanese sushi and starters with yummy Chinese entrees. Service was great and our seating outside provided great ambience."}
{"text":"I love this neighborhood sushi restaurant!  I like to come here when I'm in a quiet mood.  Presentation is beautiful here."}
{"text":"Good food. Service was good. Only have one stall for the restroom. That kinda sucks. Rolls were on the smaller side."}
{"text":"I'm rather confused about the reviews that this place has received. I went here for lunch today. We were the first ones there at 11:30 and while we were there, only three tables were occupied. I really cant see any justification for the horrible service....I'll get into that more in the review.   The restaurant itself is the typical strip mall restaurant setup. I liked the booths. The seats were like large boxes without backs. There wasn't anyone sitting behind us but can imagine that some might be uncomfortable with that when it's busy...your back would be literally against the back of the person sitting behind you. I'm a social person so think that it has potential and is an interesting way to provide seating.   The sushi wasn't bad....but wasn't anything to write home about either. It was a bit more expensive than it should have been. An iced tea, edemame, eel roll, and 1 piece maguro/ 1piece ebi ran me 18 bucks. I really wouldn't have minded if the service was good or if it was exceptional in the form of food presentation. Everything was mediocre at best.   The people I was with ordered from the lunch menu. They seemed to be quite happy with the quality and quantity of food. They each spent about 8 bucks. The egg drop soup was kind of bland according to one.   We all agreed on the service though. We had to ask for things multiple times, we were left alone with empty glasses, when our food came we were pretty much left alone, and we ended up sitting around for 10 minutes after we finished eating (staring at the waitress trying to get her to come over) before we had to go and ask for the check from the guy at the register. Our waitress was sitting at a table eating. Again, there were only 3 tables occupied and it was when they first opened. There is no excuse for the horrible service. I'm pretty understanding when it comes to justified bad service - I used to be a waiter. I understand that when things are crazy and chaotic, that service can suffer...and understandably. However, there is no excuse for how we were treated...or not treated as the case may be. I wont be going back to this place. If I do, it will be for carry out. It's been a long time since I've left anything less than 20% for a tip. The service dragged this rating down.  So, pretty much: Don't get the Sushi, Order from the lunch or dinner special menu, Don't eat in."}
{"text":"5 of us came here for my husband's 40th birthday celebration. This is definitely our favorite sushi hangout. The staff is always happy and make us feel like we're hanging out at a sushi version of Cheers!   And if the the staff isn't enough to win you over, the food will amaze you!  Awesome happy hour specials!  Thank you, once again, for making our experience a special one."}
{"text":"Really nice sushi ~ Especially Arizona roll! I love here!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing!! Our waitress Lizzie was super cute and nice. Really helpful with our questions. I had the poke salad, tuna sushi, and the fried gyoza. My friend had the teriyaki shrimp and everything was amazing!! Please please try this place."}
{"text":"Been here twice now and everything so far is fantastic!! Pink lady is my fav. Happy hour is great! Gets kinda busy after so go early!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for Chinese food and sushi. The ingredients are always fresh and high quality. The sushi rolls are awesome (no see thru pieces of fish like at Sushi brokers).  I have tried all the sushi houses in the area and Kawaii's rolls are at the top of the list. Ask the owner - I only order the Samarai roll. (A lot of yellow tail, tuna avocado, white tuna, and salmon) and not a lot of rice.  Yum.  The atmosphere is busy and the staff are knowledgeable and attentive. If you get Tyler or Gabriella you will be happy. When the owner is on the flower helping and running food you know they care. You're gonna wait for a table on Friday or Saturday night but it's worth it. You're also going to pay a little more for quality that is noticeable.    This ain't your cheap Chinese take out joint. There are plenty of those. The orange Chicken is the best in the west valley and the roasted eggplant is off the hook.  Have a special occasion ?  Order the Smokey Robinson roll !"}
{"text":"Quite disappointed with our dinner here. We asked for chicken soup with just chicken and veg (no noodles) - we got a bowl full of noodles with a few bits of chicken and vegetables. We ordered schezuan flounder but they served us tilapia without asking if it was ok to substitute. Did they think we wouldn't notice ? Def won't be back."}
{"text":"Had a bad experience but the owner was terrific at handling it . Will be back"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going here for  a few years now since we moved to the area....and Love it. Its our \"go to\" neighborhood restaurant for good food and great service. We love that we have gotten to know the staff and they remember us each time. We have tried so many different things on the menu and have never been disappointed. So glad we found this place. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We like this place and go often.  I like their happy hour options to add an appetizer for $.99 to your beer.  We order edamame for our daughter who loves it, when coupled with their egg drop soup is a nutritious and affordable kid friendly option.  We like the different rolls you can get here and the prices are reasonable.  I do think they add too much vinegar to their sushi rice which makes all of the rolls taste similar and tangy.  They are friendly and I just adore the decor."}
{"text":"When I moved here from the east coast I was worried I wouldn't find the same super fresh sushi that I love so much... After quite a few recommendations I came here and now I very literally eat here once or twice a week. The sushi is fantastic, the Chinese food is amazing. And they are always adding new things to the menu."}
{"text":"Food is fabulous and service is great!!! Everything we got was so good... great portions for the price. Felt like i was back east... so hard to find Good Chinese out west. Even the water tastes good!!!"}
{"text":"The owner always remembers us and is so kind to our 2 year old. Very family oriented place. It's a regular of ours."}
{"text":"Second time I've been here. The atmosphere is really cool. It's a very tiny restaurant, but there is outside seating and  the decor is neat. If you have the forethought to make reservations, do so, because there are literally two chairs for guests to sit on while your waiting. Prices are affordable, even alcoholic drinks. Their food is good. I like their orange chicken and fried rice. We waited a really long time for our check to both be delivered to us and then for our waitress to return for it. She was really sweet though so I'm not that upset by it. If you're looking for affordable Asian food, this is the place!"}
{"text":"After reading the 5 star reviews we gave this place a shot. It wasn't terrible but not \"the best\" I've ever had. We ordered the California, spicy tuna and the shrimp tempura rolls off the happy hour menu. I felt like the regular menu was a bit pricey. $13-$15 for a roll? Obviously a lot of people like it so maybe it's just a personal taste profile."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant many times and always enjoyed the food, service and atmosphere. Recently, the experience was sub par. We were sat for over 15 minutes with no visit from a server. After seeing at least 4 other tables sat and served drinks, I went to the front and mentioned that we were still waiting for service. Our server finally came and we ordered for drinks, appetizers, sushi and an entree. Our drinks were brought out and then all of our food was brought out at the same time, rather than as we ordered. I am disappointed that the wait staff was not as attentive as we are used to and truly hope this isn't a trend, but the food, especially the sushi, is always tasty."}
{"text":"Whether I keep it basic or get a little crazy with my order, Kawaii always comes through.   You've had General Tso's chicken, you've tried it at dozens of Chinese joints. You HAVE TO try their version. It's sliced thin, then it's breaded in a light batter, then fried to perfection before being smothered in a tangy and sweet and savory sauce, with just a hint of heat. Sometimes the sauce for General T's chicken can be more plum than orange and therefore more sweet than tart but this definitely leans orange with some honey. Every bite is perfect because the crispiness of the fry is always there due to the cut of the chicken and the sauce coats every surface evenly. If you want to, ask them to make it spicy and they will.   Another basic thing to try here is the lomein. The noodles have a nice char on them from those hot woks in the kitchen and the ingredients tossed with them are plentiful.  Salt and pepper calamari is worth a try and while I'm super intrigued by it whenever I see (and hear) that someone else has ordered it, I have yet to try the sizzling steak and mushrooms but I told Alexa to put it on my to-do list.  All the sushi rolls are delicious and they are portioned well. The sushi chefs do their thang behind an open bar so you can see what they're working with.   Happy hour specials are pretty good, wish they lasted til 7 tho.  As it's about the only game in this part of the NW Valley, it does get packed during prime hours so bring a coat and sit out on the patio if you don't want to wait an extra long time for a table."}
{"text":"This place for the price is one of my favorites. They have excellent sushi and the orange chicken is amazing. If you are on the North West Side and in the mood for sushi give it a shot."}
{"text":"Service is a little slow, but very good and very helpful. Always my go to for good food though. Whether you just want some good entrees or sushi they're priced just right. Even though the place is always busy, I've never had to make a reservation. Also, you can never ever go wrong with their $25 all you can eat sushi menu!"}
{"text":"I dare you to punch me, my face is so hard, you'll say \"Ouch, you crunched me!\" -Froggy Fresh  Out of the trio of rolls we ordered, my favorite was the Green Beret Roll, such fresh flavors emanating from the thinly sliced jalapeños, with the crunch of the cucumbers and pop from the matching green roe (which are wasabi flavored baby flying fish).  The potstickers were so plump, moist and flavorful, and hot... essentially pillows of porky goodness.  And just like a real fluffy pillow, these big boys can choke you if you try putting the whole thing in your mouth at once, they're that uuuge!  And after I posted my sushi photo, the owner, Kelly, came by to chat with us for a bit, and to say Thanks for the pic.  If you enjoy an outgoing personality with a whopping side of friendly and gracious demeanor, then ask for her by name!"}
{"text":"Food presentation was terrific, but taste and price was not preferable to Sakana, which is only slightly further of a drive.  (4 mi) Service was friendly and acceptable, but has room for improvement (I had to show the waiter how to open the split of champagne, and they forgot our miso soup.)"}
{"text":"Delicious rolls! 4 stars because the service isn't phenomenal and it's a little pricey."}
{"text":"Waited well over an hour for our food. Several tables that came in more than 30 minutes after us, were served ahead of us. Not sure what happened to our order. We were finally served with the meals coming around 20 minutes apart. The manager was nice and apologized but did not offer any concession. Waiter avoided us. Not a pleasant experience. Not planning to return."}
{"text":"Best Chinese around!!!!! Great ambiance and wonderful service! Super friendly staff too... I wouldn't listen to any bad reviews for this restaurant,  everything is wonderful all the way around. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Place was packed.  Food was well prepared and tasteful. The rolls were fresh and in generous portion .  Service a little slow but with apologies"}
{"text":"My family and I love this place! Delicious food, great vibe, and friendly staff willing to go above and beyond for their customers. The Vegas roll was to die for! It was by far the best I have ever ordered. This restaurant is definitely one of our faves!"}
{"text":"My daughter, wife, and I stopped in for lunch around 1pm today - we had heard positive things and obviously most the reviews are good.  SERVICE: Unfortunately we were disappointed- our server seemed very lost. There was a bit of a rush but we were seated promptly. Server came over w/in 5 minutes to take our drink order. TWENTY minutes went by before my wife went up to her at the front desk and asked if we were going to get our drinks. She looked like she didn't know what my wife was talking about. Another server hopped in & got our drinks within a few minutes.  FOOD: We ordered s/s chicken for my daughter, edimame, and pork slices as appetizers, along with soup, mixed veggie roll, shrimp/avocado roll and a Fuji mountain roll. After bringing out the appetizers (which were delicious) and my s/s chicken (delicious & good portion size), our sushi came out. Much smaller portions than what I've had at other restaurants @ similar pricing. Again, after bringing out the shrimp/avocado and mixed veggie roll I was told they didn't have what was needed to make the Fuji mountain roll. The manager (maybe the owner?) asked if I'd like something else instead. I settled on the cherry blossom roll.  Cherry blossom roll was outstanding, the other two rolls were OK.  The manager/owner came back over and apologized for all the issues we had, which I can certainly appreciate but I would've also thought it warranted a comp'd item.  I have really mixed feelings about my visit today but I don't know if I'll be back. I want to support local small businesses but there too many \"oopsies\" in my first dining attempt."}
{"text":"Love this place. I've eaten here (take out) maybe 4 times now. The General tso's chicken and orange chicken are really good. The shrimp fried rice is the best I've ever had. After having there's, I don't want anyone else's. It's the bomb dot com.   I would skip on the vegetable lo mein. Super oily/greasy and missing some flavor. Also skip the Mongolian beef. Again missing some flavor. There's plenty of green onion and pepper flakes but that's about it.  I'm excited to try more stuff here."}
{"text":"Sushi was good, it was dead at 4pm on a Monday, but we still didn't get very good service. We were checked on 2 times in the hour that we were there. Drinks sat empty for most of that time...  Food came out quick, we ordered 4 rolls and 3 apps. My husband took my two oldest boys to run to Walmart and rent some movies and grab dessert for later tonight and while I tried to walk out with a drink, Togo box and my 18lb baby in his car seat, no one offered to hold the door while I struggled to get out. There was even a kid that works there that was washing the windows on the outside and he just stepped aside while he watched me try to come through the door.. Very rude I thought. I would have gotten the door, but maybe that's just how I was raised..  Food good, service not so good... Place is small but cute inside and you pay at the desk when you walk out, not at the table.  We ordered, chicken tempura, Chinese style dumplings (6), crab puffs (4), chicken lettuce wraps, super volcano roll, dynamite roll, Las Vegas roll and spicy tuna roll and it cost us $86 for all that. With tip it was $100, even with bad service, I'm not a jerk."}
{"text":"The food was solid. We ordered the Osaka roll, Dynamite roll, and a pork udon. Osaka roll was the best out of all, Dynamite roll was mediocre (a bit too much rice), and BBQ pork udon was on the salty side. However, the biggest knock on this restaurant is the server. If this server didn't exist, I would actually give this restaurant 4 stars. Why is she so bad? Well, let me explain...  For starters, we got there at around 8:50 pm and there was no one to greet us. Then, the server came by with this permanent scowl on her face and told us that the kitchen is closing - not even a hello or a how are you. This was pretty ridiculous considering the hours show that the restaurant closes at 9:30 pm. Her boss (this older Chinese lady) had to pull her aside and let us know that we could be seated. Thank you, older Chinese lady - you were the saving grace of this restaurant. Even though the first server took our order and brought the check, she never came by again for anything else - not even for water or to ask how we were doing. She didn't even bring us the food, and left that job for the chef.  All the while we were eating, this older Chinese was doing all the work (wiping tables, putting away utensils, etc) and the girl was diddle-daddling the whole time. She clearly did not want to be there, had no intention to do any work, and just wanted to go home early. Shame on this server for even being in the service industry! She left the older Chinese lady to act as our server AND the one to clean up the restaurant. I made damn sure at the end to give the tip directly to the older lady. How that girl even still has a job there is beyond me. If I was the owner, I would have fired her a long time ago. To all the diners here, if you see the server who looks like a Hispanic lady in her 20's, turn around and RUN THE OTHER WAY. I have never encountered such a terrible server in my life and she single-handedly ruined the entire dining experience."}
{"text":"Great service and food! Quick and fresh! & friendly too :).. overall good. Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Love Kawaii!  The food is delicious, and the service is great!  The sushi is fresh, reasonably priced, and SO good! Definitely try the Happy Valley Roll, Phoenix Roll, Las Vegas Roll, Philadelphia Roll, Mixed Vegetable Roll, and California Roll...YUM!   Not a sushi fan?  Their entrees are fantastic....try their Orange Chicken, Lo Mein, and Mongolian Beef!  Their portions are huge!   Whether we sit inside in a booth, at the sushi bar, or on the patio....Kawaii never disappoints."}
{"text":"Ordered via phone for to go. Quoted about 20-25 mins. Happy Hour pricing on appetizers is available on take out orders.   Ended up waiting over 35 minutes total from order time. They were busy, but they should update pick up time accordingly.  Soft shell crab was not as expected nor as experienced at Japanese restaurants. The batter was far too excessive to the point of being about 80% batter, 20% crab (at most). I don't think the entire crab was provided in an order either. I ended up wasting most of the dish. Will never get it again if cooked like that still.  It was made in a Chinese sauce and was not good nor expected.  Seafood soup was less than mediocre. It was basically egg drop soup with fake crab, and tiny and few bits of shrimp. No scallop was found at all.  Flavor nothing to write home about.  Tempura was battered excessively. There was no flavor to the batter.  It was not crispy, perhaps due to so much batter being on the pieces.   Under this new ownership (since 1st opening in that center), it is more of Chinese style, thus the sub-title description \"Asian\" vs. Japanese. They should have changed the name from a Japanese word to something more Asian so people would not think it was authentic Japanese food/style.  Disappointed. Don't plan to return again."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in the neighborhood. The sushi is fantastic and the owner is one of the nicest people I have ever met. She treats you like family. I haven't had anything other than the sushi and sake, of which they have an amazing selection to choose from."}
{"text":"My sister and I decided that we wanted sushi. We went to this place because it was close to our house and we had both of our kids.   We got there and the lady sat us and then attended to her other tables. We sat there for a good while staring at her waiting for menus. We had to ask another gentleman who also got us our waters.  She was very rude and when we asked for things like soup she would stare at us and walk away.   She only had two tables and barely came over to us. When we got our check we needed to split it as I was explaining what we wanted to do and she walked away. We couldn't understand her half the time because she was so quiet.   To be honest the sushi was mainly rice with barely any \"meat\" to it. Out philly rolls were the tinest I have ever seen.   Their happy hour isn't even happy hour. Just a buy one get one special.   I will not be spending my money here again."}
{"text":"Kelly and her staff are wonderful!! The Phoenix roll and orange chicken are absolutely amazing! My family loves dining in or taking out either way is always fresh and yummy."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic! Huge portions and the prices are reasonable. Me and my girlfriend always share a meal cause they're so big. The staff is friendly and the place is really clean."}
{"text":"Always fresh and delicious! The lunch portions are perfect,  the sushi rolls are so good and there is such a huge selection.  The Dynamite roll is my favorite,  the orange chicken is a must,  the brown rice is always cooked perfectly."}
