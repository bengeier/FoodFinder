{"text":"I'm a great fan of this place. Eddie makes fantastic food and as a lover of spice, I can't get enough. The rice noodles combined with the chilli chicken is fantastic. Also a huge fan of the bombay chicken."}
{"text":"I've been here many times before as it is the only Hakka Chinese place in the area but the final straw was receiving burnt, overlooked, and flavourless noodles."}
{"text":"Giving this place a try for the first time, moved job location and needed to find a new Hakka spot, so far good, great portion size for lunch. Giving the General tso a try this time around, could be more spicy but overall good."}
{"text":"I love their foods, and the price is ok. If you're on a budget, I would recommend going for the lunch special, as it is a good portion of rice and some meat."}
{"text":"Chili chicken (no gravy) and crispy beef are the must have dishes, 10% off when you pick up and pay cash"}
{"text":"Dine in or pick up. I've had both. The portions at this place are quite large for the prices. 

As a vegetarian, this place has many delicious options. We usually order the hot and sour soup. Is usually quite good. Lately it's been more sour and less hot :/
We also order the chilli paneer which is not very spicy unless you ask them to make it hot. The vegetable manchurian balls are delicious. I highly recommend them. 

Lunch special: lots of tasty food for the price. I could hardly get through half of it. Even the left overs tasted great!

Take out: if you order over $25 worth of food and pay in cash, you get 10% off."}
{"text":"The place has a fast-food dining ambience to it; they didn't invest too much on tables and chairs. I order the dumplings which tasted okay, but they were swimming in oil. The plum sauce came in packets. The fried rice we order was undercooked. The lemon chicken was decent. Wouldn't go there again."}
{"text":"Qutie a decent place to dine in but lot of folks were just doing takeouts. I was their to take out as well.

The host was nice and greeted us as he was preparing a massive catering order. The food be packed for catering looked good and was being down very clean. 

We asked for a menu and he was nice and provided to us and also offered to help if we needed to understand any dish. hence, the service was very good and friendly.

I ordered shrimp rice noodles and dry chili fish. The noddles were ok but the portion was enough to fill 2 and half people. The chili fish was very nice the spiciness was great and the food was packed well as it was warm till we got home.

The pricing is decent and expect around $10 for a regular dish but that seems to be a case everywhere now. Food prices are going up and up and beyond!

I would definitely take out here again!

On a separate note - they do serve halal food but have alcohol as well."}
{"text":"Since I've moved from Mississauga it's always a treat to dine in the city as I think It has one of the best multicultural selections in the GTA.

So I was craving some Hakka while shopping at Heartland and Yelp reminded me of this place after a quick search.  I have eaten here before once or may be twice but it's been years.

It was lunch time and not too busy.  For the price you get a decent portion and I actually finished it! I must have been really hungry.

So I ordered the standard chilli chicken gravy as it's the staple favourite ;) though I did upgrade to fried rice. I'd say that it was good.  It wasn't a lasting impression of delicious but pretty tasty.  If anything I'd say it may have been low in salt, which I guess could be a good thing right?  You could always add salt/spice/soy sauce.  But I had it as it came and my tongue and belly thanked me for it!

The place is pretty basic, so it's a casual place.  They have lunch specials and offer a cash discount on regular orders.  Also no credit/debit below $10 or there's and extra $0.50 charge.

It's not my most favourite hakka in Mississauga but pretty decent I think.  I'd go back!

If you're looking for something quick, fresh, good value, and reasonably tasty hive Hakka Magic a shot.

Service was good as well."}
{"text":"It was tasty, but I had better.  I found the Hakka chow mein and chilli chicken very oily.  I find Hakka dishes usually oily, but it was extra oily this time.  They were very generous with the amount of chow mein they gave us, but I would settle for less and better quality and taste.  My stomach did not feel well afterwards, but that could be anything.  I know there are a lot of Hakka choices in Mississauga, so options are plenty!"}
{"text":"Mixed reviews. Living roughly 5 mins away, it's a good fix for cheap Chinese goods. I don't really know what's \"Hakka\" about it? I guess the first Hakka I've had was in Scarborough, at Lin Garden. That's the best I've had. This place is more Chinese than, the supposed Chinese/Indian label.

The best part about this resto, is their $5.99 12pm - 3pm Lunch special. I've posted a pic of the Garlic Shrimp w/ rice and their 6 deep fried wings.

I have to say, I told the owner about \"properly cooking\" the wings. It was still pink on the inside. Blah, what can you do? Didn't get any discount from it, just a \"sorry sir\" and the awkward, here's your bill, i'm embarassed and sorry look. ha!

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND...
- Manchurian Fish (Dry)"}
{"text":"I'm Asian and have never tried Hakka food. To be more specific, I'm an eighth Chinese. I know, I know. Tsk tsk. Shame on me. I even had to have Jennifer N clarify what Hakka food is.

The other day, I finally had my first Hakka meal thanks to Jennifer N! We went to Hakka Magic for lunch and now I know I've been depriving my belly for far too long. I had the garlic beef with egg fried rice plus stole pieces of manchurian fish from Jenn's plate - all very tasty! 

Hakka Magic's lunch special hooks you up! Heaping proportion of your choice of protein and rice with pop/tea/spring roll for less than $10 - yes please! I'm looking forward to returning with a group so I can try a bit of everything from their regular menu.

Happen to be in Sauga, looking for Chinese food with some bite that will contently fill you up, but won't burn a hole in your wallet? Then be sure to make a stopover at Hakka Magic"}
{"text":"Good food and pretty good prices. Lots to choose from. Wait staff are very nice. Lunch specials seem to be fairly good. If using debit/credit to pay the total has to be more than 10 dollars."}
{"text":"I came here last weekend for a lunch with a couple I know.

So, living close to this whole new suburban development of big box stores and hard to access plaza's has been pretty interesting.

The plaza Hakka Magic is located in was once only accessible by a road that only went one way - not sure if that makes sense - but if you were to pass it you would have to drive another 1 km to do a u turn, overshoot it and another u turn. 
(only recently has this changed and they have paved more road to another entrance to this plaza) Gotta love Mississauga.

The food was pretty good. We had soup to start. Big portions. A medium easily feeds 4 people at least 1 serving. Had the sweet corn crab soup.

Next we had the chili chicken with gravy not dry, a fried rice dish and beef dish.

Overall the taste was there, the spice level wasnt out of control and it was flavourful.

It isnt a classy place, its just a tiny little corner store in a plaza sandwiched between indian couture stores. The serve was good , water was being refilled multiple times.

I would go here again."}
{"text":"Have been there on 3 separate occasions
Ordered chilli chicken
Comes out on rice that's burned and chicken that was warm and Ina soupy sauce that tasted ok
Ordered general Tao 
Bares as tricking resemblance and taste
Ordered the Hakka beef and noodles
Tasted good but burned noodles and were hard at points
After all three visits I had digestive issues for three or more days 
Won't go back as there is clearly a sanitary issue here 
Imodium is a must
Oh and there is not heat in the winter they have a small 1500 watt heater"}
{"text":"Flavourful food, great service and dirt cheap prices for massive portions. Their all-day specials are great; Hakka noodles, hot & sour soup, Manchurian soup, chilli chicken and garlic chicken are the best. Been here so many times but I've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Their food is just ok, nothing special to write home about, I usually come down to this plaza and thought I'd give it a try, so I did. The food was very oily and the onions was burnt. Maybe some ppl like burnt food but I certainly don't. But other than that it's alright. It's not at hakkah ren level food."}
{"text":"I really like Hakka Magic. I come here for lunch an awful lot. It's just good Hakka food. Brisk service. Great lunch specials. Main + rice (steamed or fried) + spring roll or drink = $6.99. I always get the Manchurian Fish with Egg Fried Rice and a pop. Pass on the spring roll as it's mostly cabbage. 

Lunch here is fast-paced and can get packed. Don't fret though as people don't linger."}
{"text":"Great meals for lunch definately worth the money if your a regular out-of-the-office luncher."}
{"text":"Great, tasty food that is very inexpensive. Favourite place in Mississauga for Hakka Chinese. Chilli Chicken, Garlic Prawns are great."}
{"text":"If I could rate this place with more than 5 stars, I WOULD. The food is exceptionally delicious, flavourful and the true definition of what I'd call Hakka. The prices and portions are above and beyond my expectations. I've been coming here every Friday for the last two years, and have yet to complain. The service is very friendly too, Eddie is amazing. If you're in heartland looking for some great, fresh and spicy Chili Chicken, Hakka Magic is a must try. I've recommended this place to all my friends and family, who have also become addicted regular customers. Recently got catering here, everything was great. 10/10 recommend!!"}
{"text":"Food is average Hakka food at best. People who work there can barely communicate in English and it was a nightmare ordering from this place. We got back to find out they messed up our order. Big surprise there. Terrible. Will not go back."}
{"text":"Grabbed dinner from here last night. I wasn't too impressed this time. 
The chicken corn soup was too bland. And too watery. 
The chili chicken dry wasn't bad though
The beef with garlic was also just ehhh
The beef was tough. Not sure about the quality of the beef either. 
Maybe it was just an off day."}
