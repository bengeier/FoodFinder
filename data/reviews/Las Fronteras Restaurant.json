{"text":"Yesterday afternoon we went to eat at this restaurant my friend, her husband, my husband and I as we have repeatedly been. My friend order encebollado, her husband order a plate that had beans, rice, and a steak the dish was cold and he asked the waitress to warm it a little, she went and told the lady in the kitchen which is the owner of las fronteras and she heat it up too much, he could not eated until it cooled a bit. My husband ordered la jalea which was old and rare as we gave to try our friends to see what they felt and thought the same as us, so we called the waitress back and told her that la jalea was old and weird, she grabbed the plate and went to the kitchen where the owner was, the waitress told the owner that we did not want la jalea because it was old (we heard everything from the table where we were sitting) the owner left the kitchen grabbed are bill and brought to us to the table instead of her apologizing for la jalea was old and tasted rare, insted she started screaming at us in front of the other customers that she would never sell something old, she showed us are bill as she kept yelling at us that she did not charge us for la jalea, My husband and I answer very respectful and told the lady that we did not have a problem to pay for la jalea, we just wanted to let her know that it was bad as per some customers give their feed back about the food and service. My husband and I we are never coming back to this place we felt embarrassed and disrespected by the owner..."}
{"text":"These people are unreal.  The food is good, but dealing with the staff is another thing.  I call ahead of time asking if they had humitas and tamales de pollo and was told that yes, infact they did.  Mind you, I spoke in perfect Spanish and when I got there... They didn't have both of the things I asked and denied that someone even called.  Are they brain dead? I really don't know, but this isn't the first time I've had to deal with this kind of crap."}
{"text":"The service is horrible. We sat down and waited for someone to greet us. Server handed us the menus and walked away. When she came to take our order she stood over the table and just looked at us like we were supposed to know we should have been ready. Everything time we asked for something she had to check if they had it and most of the time there was nothing available. She seemed so put out that she had to check the kitchen each time.  We order tasteless empanadas, once filled with hot sauce it was meh. They completely forgot my order and my friends were practically done there meals before mine even arrived. The beans were drowning in water and  made the rice soggy. And when they brought the they spilled the bean juice all over the floor and my leg. Honestly this place was just shitty in all aspects"}
