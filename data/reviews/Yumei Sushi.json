{"text":"Very friendly service. Like the hot towel and cold noodles that are served with your meal. Sashimi is superb."}
{"text":"We are in the restaurant industry and I hate leaving bad reviews but after a very disappointing Sunday dinner I felt like I owed it to everyone in my shoes looking for good sushi.. Fish wasn't fresh, wasn't cut properly for sushi, and the spider roll was not edible... hopefully it was just a bad night for them."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi in the beach! Much nicer and fresher than the others (I haven't tried aki yet though) anyways I love the presentation and they are always super friendly. I always get bento box's more bang for my buck for the lunch special, but I have tried other dishes that are great as well. Pricing is also justifiable,  not too steep!"}
{"text":"Found this place last year - very good! Fresh and tasty. Even my mom who is Japanese liked the food (the Korean version of Japanese food isn't exactly the same - she's picky).   I would definitely recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"A friend who is a sushi connesseur recommended that we try it. Usually we go to cheaper places but wow, Yumei was worth it! The sashami fish is definitely fresh, and they use real red snapper rather than cheap talapia for the 23 piece sashimi dinner ($25) that I had. Even the miso soup and salad were better. And the hot towel before the meal was served was a nice touch. Will come again!"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal: a japanese-style sushi restaurant where it's about the fish rather than inventive maki to serve local tastes (though in fairness, they do have a bunch of speciality rolls).  Their nigiri is big hunks of very fresh and carefully cut fish engulfing small mounds of rice...mmm....fish deliciousness. As another reviewer pointed out, the miso is spot-on fermented goodness and garnished with little mushrooms...tasty. Their tea even tastes like the green tea served in Japan. Combined with the slightly kitschy not-really-rice-paper screened booths, you might think you're in Japan.   It's a few bucks more than your standard neighborhood sushi restaurant, but it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"Great fish and also best side salad I've had at a sushi place. Service was quick, efficient, and on point. There are many places where you'd pay the same and get far lower quality."}
{"text":"Best Sushi place in the Beaches by far. Everything looks and tastes fresh and the service is excellent. It's a little on the pricey side, but I'll spend an extra dollar or two for better quality."}
{"text":"I've been to quite a few sushi places and I'm willing to say this is now my favorite. Each item is prepared with care and only the freshest ingredients. I ordered Spicy Salmon and for the first time it was actually spicy! Even the green salad was amazing.  Very delicately made and not just another free item with meal. Highly recommend trying this one!"}
{"text":"First time here? All you need to know is the folllowing:  1. Spicy salmon sashimi 2. East end maki roll with soft shell crab 3. Gyoza 4. Cheesecake  Enjoy, and have a wonderful time."}
{"text":"This place alone is reason enough for me to move to Canada. Yeah, I said it! Every time I come to Toronto, I HAVE TO visit Yumei, and it has never disappointed me in the least.   At a typical sushi restaurant, I'll choose what I want, but not here... I just sit back and let Young choose for me. I always know he is going to pick out the best fish of the day, and from experience, I have no reason to think otherwise. The sushi is by the far the freshest and best tasting I've had in North America, and suffice to say, he doesn't skimp on the portions either. See the picture I posted if you don't believe me!  Also, my girlfriend doesn't like sushi, but that's fine here... the teriyaki was top notch, and they do a superb job with vegetable tempura. Even the miso soup was a cut above!"}
{"text":"Decided to review after my 10th visit.  Sushi places in Toronto have a habit of not being so consistent as time passes.  Food: the menu is very consistent.  All of the sushi, sashimi and maki I have tried is fresh, no one fave.  Heres a pro tip.  Get the chicken dolsot bibimbap (yes the korean stone bowl dish), you probably wont feel like it because you came for Japanese.  However...its the best bibimbap Ive had in the city and rivals those ive had in Seoul.   Remember not to scoop the bottom rice until the end when its nice and crispy!  Also, the flash-boiled lobster sashimi (added recently as a special) is heavier on the wallet but great and  was clearly fresh.    Cleanliness: extremely clean.  Looking into the kitchen you can tell they run a tight ship."}
{"text":"Impeccable.  The uni is always the right temperature and so nicely presented.  Washes down great with a teapot of wam saki.  Try getting one of the grilled fish dinners instead of sushi sometime.  So delicious.  The staff are great and treat you first class from hello to goodbye.  They love kids which is a good thing as kids seem to be a large part of their clientele.  I don't understand how so many young children can have a thing for sushi, but they just do.  I forgot to mention my all-time favorite dish which is the udon noodle soup (seafood version).  When I get a craving I know where to go."}
{"text":"Wow - best sushi I have had in a very long time.  Owner is on premises.  Attention to detail and quality of dishes were amazing.  Everything was absolutely delicious and each dish that passed by our table made us wish we weren't so full already.  Still, we probably ordered 2 dishes more than we should have but we couldn't help ourselves!!  Sitting by the kitchen certainly made our mouths water all night.  You simply can't go wrong with this unassuming japanese sushi bar at The Beach."}
{"text":"After reading many positive reviews I was excited to try out this place. I ended up ordering the sushi lunch for $15. It came with salad, soup, and two amuse bouche - deep fried fish and potato, and rice. The Sashimi was underwhelming - four slices of salmon, 4 slices of tuna, and 4 slices of white snapper. The slices were not even full size slices and lacked flavor.   I wanted to order a side dish of uni however the sushi was priced at $9.95.  This place did have soft shell crab and lobster sashimi however I did not try them out on this visit.   The service was excellent however I was disappointed by the lunch."}
{"text":"This is my favourite sushi place in the beach.. its a little on the pricier side but it is absolutely worth it. You will find the quality of the appetizers are surprizing, the gyoza are melty and overstuffed with meat. I usually don't pay attention to appetizers at sushi, my mind is always set on getting to the fresh fish asap.... but I think you will find yourself enjoying the salads, soups and dumplings here just as much as the sashimi itself. The rolls are BIG, they are serious about that. Between two people we couldn't eat more than 2 rolls, the muskoka and kamikaze rolls get a big thumbs up from us. Spicy, fresh fish, the rolls were so big you wanted to take two bites, but I know how disastrous and messy that can be! Don't do it! If you are in the beach, this is your best bet for sushi, if there is a line up, wait... its worth it!"}
{"text":"\"Yumei\" the word for famous in Japanese is an established neighborhood favourite in the beach, and our friend Martin's as well.. I did put up a protest as I don't enjoy going to generic sushi places especially ones that have also Korean dishes on the menu. However there were many surprises during the meal prompting me to even write about the experience.  My enthusiasm for food gave my dining companions the confidence to let me take the reigns and order our dinner which I did with gusto.  We ordered a sashimi boat for the 4 of us, eliminating the octopus and surf clam pieces and requesting additional butterfish, which is my very favourite sashimi as it just melts in your mouth like butter. The server then upsold us with their specialties of the evening including abalone sashimi.  The makis were very big bites and loosely rolled so they fell apart.  All in all it was a fun night and I would probably go there again if I'm in the East end.."}
{"text":"This is an exceptional Japanese sushi restaurant run by a Korean chef!  Toronto Japanese restaurant quality have been running downhills since the decline of Japanese tourists and closeouts of Japanese hotel chains. Most of the sushi restaurants are run by Chinese or Korean.  Finally, I found a descent one in the beaches area.  Recommending the sushi mix plate, and the tempura.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Full disclosure - I live around the corner.  Still - consistent, high quality. Nice touches and details in the appetizer change-up details.  Never been let down - they consistantly have UNI - sea urchin when in season- not  always found at every sushi joint.  Even when I order the same dish, the presentation is creatively varied to delight."}
{"text":"A tiny Japanese restaurant with the very freshest fish and friendly staff. It's out by the beach area and worth the taxi ride from downtown."}
{"text":"Wonderful service and food! Amazing presentation! Definitely recommend this place, the owner really cares about the food, service, customer service, and everyone works hard there.   Definitely would come back"}
{"text":"Good service, super super friendly. Wish they were quicker with the tea though and I got my first course in reverse order strangely but maybe she didn't realize I wanted to start with my first order first. So fresh it's like it jumped out of the sea onto your table which is a must when you're eating it raw. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Consistently delicious, fresh and the best Japanese food on Queen Street. Polite and gracious service. Worth the price! ...Totally recommend!"}
{"text":"Very fresh high quality food. I ordered spicy salmon rolls and it was actual chopped up fresh salmon chunks...not that spicy mayo squish I've gotten at 99% of sushi spots. This place doesn't cheap out. Prices are a little higher than average, but the quality makes it worth while. We even got our own little private booth/room which turned our quick bite to eat into a nice dinner date."}
{"text":"HANDS-DOWN THE BEST SUSHI IN TORONTO!!  If you live in beaches area, you're lucky.... Lucky to have one of the best sushi restaurant nearby!  Yumei means Popular, Famous in Japanese.. Yes.. it is so true.. This is busy and popular place among the sushi lovers!  The atmosphere is always super clean, welcoming. It is a traditional, authentic and finest Japanese restaurant. Been here many times for 7+ years. Never disappointing.  Everything is top-notch quality and super yummy! I love their salmon, scallop and flounder and uni a lot!!   I think they manage their fish very well and strictly with their special method..  Because their fish is distinctively, extremely fresh..and flavourful.  Anyways I would recommend to order sushi or sashimi from a la carte menu. So amazing and generous portion of sushi will be coming.   And they have BiBimBap on the menu, too. Wow!!..the best quality and taste Bi bim bap EVER!  Actually I didn't like that much before..but Ever since I tried BBB at Yumei, it is my another favourite menu!   They have options for bibimbap...beef or seafood or chicken or veggie. My fav is beef one!!:)  It served in a sizzling hot stone bowl. Feeling very healthy and nutritive and filling..even very flavourful! It is must try. Only $12 at lunch time comes with miso soup and garden salad on the side.   Price-wise, It is reasonable considering the quality. Definitely worth the trip out.   They said chef Young has over 35 years of sushi chef career from Japan to Korea and running this restaurant over 21+ years which is amazing and admirable.  Also the sushi bar chefs are professional and passionate about their fish, as well as their knives and preparation techniques.   And servers are always attentive and friendly.  The best customer service I have ever received anywhere."}
{"text":"I'm lucky enough to live close by but I've come to respect this place as one of the best Japanese seafood restaurants in the city. I came here yesterday to try their dishes featuring seaweed, because i'm researching the new edition of the No Nonsense Guide to World Food, which features \"sea greens\" as a major and extremely healthy and eco-friendly food source still to be fully used. They include wakame (sea mustard) in their seafood soup, but it is served almost on its own as seaweed salad. It is delicious, tossed simply in rice vinegar, soy sauce and lemon, and is served beautifully -- not weedy in the least. If you have any doubts about the tastefulness of \"sea greens,\" try it. Check it out on the web and you'll see it has sizable amounts of about a dozen key nutrients. wayne r"}
{"text":"I think I'd give this place closer to 3.5 stars out of 5. I would give it 4 out of 5 stars if we were just rating on the sashimi alone. It was a busy night, but we still managed to get a table for dinner despite it being a small establishment. Overall, quality of food was good, though some things were better than others.  Service was attentive, waitresses were always coming around to check in and refill water. Ordered a large sashimi boat ($60) to share as a group of 3. I thought the price was reasonable given that the sashimi slices were decent in size and fresh.    We also ordered a seafood pancake appetizer. I would pass on this, as it was mainly an omelette with random pieces of seafood. Also ordered a beef bibimbap, it was good and filling, but otherwise pretty generic.  Didn't try any rolls, but the appearance looked good. It's probably a no-brainer, but if you're coming here, I would stick with  ordering sushi and sashimi rather than any of the Korean dishes."}
{"text":"This wasn't my first choice - my boyfriend and I really wanted to go to Sunset Grill for brunch after reading GREAT reviews on Yelp! So, we made the cold trek and soon found a long line at the restaurant so we knew it was going to be good. Anticipation all around. BUT THEY ONLY ACCEPTED CASH WHICH WE BOTH DIDN'T HAVE! (Super Fail!)  So, we searched around on Yelp for the next nearest, good-reviews-on-Yelp place and found ourselves at Yumei. We walked in and I was instantly hit with a fake pot-pouri smell...the kind used in bathrooms. We waited for a couple of minutes before being seated in a private booth which was great - there are 4 in total. Menus were quickly brought and we decided to order: Spice Age Tofu, California and Chicken Teriyaki Lunch Box, Bulgogi and Tempura Lunch Box (which comes with salad and soup).  The menu is very, very extensive so my review basically is limited to the items we ordered and may not necessarily represent the entire food choices here. The Spicy Tofu was really gross: soggy, fried, COLD tofu that was covered in thick \"spicy\" sauce that only made the tofu soggier. My chicken was all white meat so it wasn't the chicken teriyaki I was expecting (dark meat with that bit of crispy skin on top). Bland, boring, and nothing special. My boyfriend said his meal was all right but his Bulgogi looked dry and sad.  In total, our 3 dishes with one large sparkling water came out to $45 not including tip which I thought was expensive for what we ordered. We even wanted to order more food as we were still hungry but the waitress already brought our bill and we didn't want to start again.  Service. I can only describe it as average. Nothing personal. I had ordered green tea and there was no checking-up to see if I wanted re-fills. In fact, there was no checking up on all. There was only one waitress serving tables so I would imagine service to be quite slow on busier time periods.  All in all, I wouldn't come back here as compared to other Japanese restaurants I have been to, it's just not up to par. If you like fusion cuisine, then you might want to try Yumei as it carries Korean dishes as well."}
{"text":"Best sushi in the Beaches! We also love their Korean offerings. This place can get busy on the weekends so it's best to get a reservation."}
{"text":"All you need to know is that they have the freshest fish in the whole darn city. Every single time. It isn't a haute cuisine kaiseki Japanese place that you would go for a formal dinner, but it is the place you would go for absolutely any other time you wanted Japanese (or some Korean) food.  I like the pace of the place, it allows me to enjoy my dinner and have a nice long chat with my dining companions.  What's your hurry Toronto? I lived three years in Japan (I'm not a sushi expert but I've had my fair share and know what I love) and for sushi, I don't go anywhere else. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Yumei is my favourite sushi restaurant.  The fish is consistently fresh, the service is friendly and efficient, and the restaurant is comfortable and inviting. We go again and again, because we've never been disappointed in any way.   Spicy fish soup!"}
{"text":"I often find comments with \"the best\" and \"the worst\" quite exaggerated, not this time though, this is the worst sushi I've ever had.   Fish isn't fresh with an extremely odd rubbery texture, sushi rice tough as hell :(   I was nauseated afterwards.   Really?"}
{"text":"Yumei is simply \"Sushi Mecca\" if there ever was such a place!  Take the time to know Young and his staff, and you too will long for opportunities to return to Toronto...  I first dined at Yumei in '98 while in Toronto on business.  Mine was not a quick meal but a journey of everything that Young had to offer...  4 hours later, I had enjoyed everything -- thoroughly enjoyed!  I've since returned to Toronto on countless occasions and eagerly look forward to any opportunity to return to Yumei.  As with any fine sushi experience,  - always sit at the sushi bar (make reservations and tell Young that \"Dave from New Jersey\" recommended the place) - never rub your chopsticks together (it's not classy people!) - wasabi goes on top of your sushi, not in your sauce - never order with pencil and paper -- Young knows what's best (explain your limits if you have any) - tell him your budget!  Reservations are STRONGLY suggested particularly if you wish to sit at the sushi bar!  Not only does Yumei have sushi, but they also have a full kitchen capable of preparing any number of Japanese and Korean delicacies   Take the time to venture out to \"the beaches\".  You'll not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Nicely prepared dishes and good quality food. Nice people.  Great restaurant for dates!  Can also hop over to Castro's for a beer after dinner..."}
{"text":"Yumei used to be one of my favourite Japanese-Korean chow stations. Partly because it's in my hood, partly because it was reasonably priced, and mostly because it was pretty damn good. Then they hiked their prices. All the way up to Fujiyama.   Well, this is no Nobu but still, it is an excellent sushi-sashimi-korean-grill stop. My faves here are different - not what I would pick if I was eating at Tojo in Vancouver, say, or Sushi Ran, in Sausalito. But while Yumei is not in that constellation, they are unfailingly reliable.   Their appetizers are extraordinary. Whether shrimp or sweet potato, the panko-crusted tempura with a light thin dipping sauce is perfect. The salmon sashimi is always excellent, fresh, clean-tasting. But when you stumble off the beaten path you discover Yumei at it's yummiest - a salver of grilled hamachi (yellowtail) cheeks come rubbed with lemon and a few flakes of sea salt. Perfect cheek-flesh succulence that can barely stay together in your chopsticks - that's how much it wants to just fall apart in your mouth. The spicy black cod is a new reason for praising all braising.   My favourite maki is the unagi and I must confess I love the toro negi maki - especially when it is at its fresh fatty best. Standard maki orders for me are the excellent cooked lobster, spicy salmon or spicy tuna. If I have company I like to close the meal with some kalbi - grilled short ribs that have had a deep, meaningful relationship with an incredibly flavourful marinade.   On a hot day it goes well with a large frosty glass of Sapporo. On a cold day, some comforting hot sake. Kampai!"}
{"text":"Our new go-to Sushi place!  Fresh, flavourful sushi that is appetizing. Service is good - quick and friendly staff.  Only 4-stars and not 5, as price point is on the higher side for Sushi. They offer a 10% discount for pick-up."}
{"text":"Started off good then got progessivly worse.  Food came out VERY slow and by the end when I was ready to leave the spicy tuna rolls finally came they tased like regular maki with sriracha chili sauce on them.  Fish was all decent but I wouldn't go back.  It is a nice atmosphere though."}
{"text":"Left hungry. I don't like leaving mediocre reviews and rarely do so, but somethings need to be mentioned. Went here with friends for dinner. Saw great reviews here on yelp and my friends who had been here before raved about it. I had the Kimchi salad and the Mandu soup to start. The kimchi was very small and average tasting considering a price of $5. The Mandu wonton soup on the over hand was large, delicious and only $3. My main issue comes with the maki. I had spicy tuna maki and Skydome maki. For only 6 very small pieces in each maki at a price of $8. per there was a lot to be desired for size and price alone. The Skydome roll had few ingredients other than nori, shrimp and rice and came sitting in a brown sauce that gave that maki a burnt flavor. Did not enjoy that one at all. The spicy tuna maki, again very small was alright but not great. The presentation I would expect to be like any standard sushi spot. These maki aside from being small, did not have any uniform similarities. Almost as if each individual piece came from a separate order. Having small unappetizing sushi is one thing, but paired with a hefty price tag is a pretty big disappointment. Judging by the great reviews of others, I can only guess that my bad experience was a one time thing and not the norm here. The service was good but sadly I will not be going back. If I had to, it would only be for the Mandu soup."}
{"text":"Delicious food and fantastic service! It was my first visit, and my table was treated with a complimentary mouth watering braised salmon cheek. Quality fish, intimate setting and an all around excellent meal."}
{"text":"Nice food and nice service. Ordered crazy roll as people here recommended. Turned out really yummy. Got the fine Japanese noodle in fish soup for my daughter (a year and a half) and she finished most of it. This will be our new hangout place."}
{"text":"Food was absolutely amazing! They have a great service. Very nice and friendly people.   I've been to so many places in the city but so far this one is the best.   I'm so excited about this restaurant that I'm writing here after I finished my food;)  So good.... I'll be back defiantly and I'll bring all my friends."}
{"text":"One of my Top 5 Favorite A La Carte Sushi Places in T.O. Amazing Fresh Sushi and Selection.  Friendly Attentive Staff ... Simply Yummy Yumei :D .. However I do have to note the service is on the slower side. However the waitresses are very friendly .. And the food keeps me coming back like a love sick puppy ;)"}
{"text":"Great Korean-Japanese restaurant. We had the Bulgugi lunch ($11) and kalbi lunch ($13) and they were excellent."}
{"text":"I am a big sushi fan and have been to so many sushi joints in toronto , by far yumei sushi has the freshest and tastiest sushi .. Its not cheap but not expensive either .. But you are really getting what you pay for .. Best sushi by far in toronto ive tried so far .. Try the spicy salmon roll .. Very unique and tasty .. Made with their own sauce not typical spicy mayo like most sushi places"}
{"text":"I have been going here for 16 of their 20 years. The food is consistently good and fresh. Healthy menu items abound. I just wish there were a few changes to the menu or specials to add variety. Also, the difficulty in communicating with the serving staff is frustrating at times. However, it remains a go to place for my hard to please daughter and I.  The Bibimbap is a nourishing favorite. I get it with brown rice and seafood. It arrives sizzling and is always fresh. They accommodate me and serve hot water and lemon as I am allergic to green tea. I enjoy the table near the window for lunch as it is a sunny inviting spit go people watch."}
{"text":"The BEST sushi in the Beaches. We went there for dinner last night with the kids and I ordered the boat and some Uni . I didn't realize how much they served as everything was brought out in portions but we managed to eat it all. Stuffed our faces. Everything tasted SO fresh. The boat for 2 came with two salads. We got the seaweed salad which had crab meat, shrimp and octopus. Delicious! M we're definitely going back and often!"}
{"text":"Sushi was pretty average .  I'm a Californian and a bit of a sushi snob though , decent variety but no creativity...second time we've been here. ..still takes just as long even though there were only two tables.  Make sure you have LOTS of time if you come here for dinner"}
{"text":"Pretty good sushi as far as Toronto sushi goes. Definitely the best sushi in the Beach. Not the cheapest, but then, with sushi, you should expect to get what you pay for. Nice, intimate atmosphere."}
{"text":"One of the best experiences in Toronto for sushi. The prices are on par with a higher end place. But the quality was outstanding. We had the smallest sushi boat for 2, and it was way too much food. And my husband and I love sushi.  Some of the nicer touches were the chef. We requested to modify our order, the waitress checked with the chef. After that the head chef came over to clarify, then stopped by to see if our food was ok. In the end he made us a special maki roll, we had asked to not have hand rolls, neither of us enjoy them. His special roll was amazing and like nothing I have ever had. Sadly we only got half way through it because we were so full.  Also the miso was amazing, they put enoki mushrooms in it, which I always like. The seaweed salad was also great as a starter.   Our only complaint, and really it's not much. We went at 5pm. The Beaches are a little too family friendly at that hour. I would definitely go back at 7pm. But be sure to book a booth, they were all booked solid when we went."}
{"text":"Everything is good and always consistent. This includes quality of food and the service!"}
{"text":"We are here in Toronto on vacation in the Beaches area and decided to get sushi here. It's a cute little place with really friendly wait staff. The food was excellent. I would recommend it if you would like to have Japanese food!"}
{"text":"Yumei Sushi is on another level for sushi - the sashimi tastes a world above the sashimi at other restaurants.  The service is great and the atmosphere is nice. This is my favorite sushi place in the Beach hands down."}
{"text":"What a gem! So clean, inviting & attractive. We enjoyed a delicious lunch in a both, although there are regular tables and a sushi bar as well (where sushi is prepared by owner & Master Chef).  Lots of excellent choices for lunch include various Bento Boxes and the Korean Dolsot Bibimpap among others.  I chose a lunch size Sushi lunch while my husband had a Bento Box. Both were excellent. The miso soup was very flavourful as was the salad, not mention our main courses.  The restaurant also has a large selection of cold Sushi -available by the bottle.  We will return and highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Heard good reviews from friends that live in the beach and dropped in tonight to grab take out. Got the Sashimi-Sushi dinner($27). Was utterly disappointed with the quality of the fish.   The sashimi portion was only salmon, tuna, and yellow tail; very disappointing since i was expecting an assortment of 10 sashimi pieces. The slicing of the fish was thick and rough cut, hacked into chunky pieces with a dull knife. I wish i has the foresight to take a photos. I ate it anyhow as i was hungry and only found the salmon and tuna edible as the yellowtail was cut so poorly it was tough and chewy.   The sushi was not much better, only this time, the thinnest slices of more tuna, salmon, yellowtail, a few other cheap assortments was placed atop of starchy clumped rice. The poor quality and execution didn't justify the price. The Miso soup was watery and flavourless.  Felt duped by their wonderful website because what i received was similar to grocery store sushi."}
{"text":"Great little sushi joint. Sort of run of the mill really for Toronto - Korean owned it appears so you know you're getting value, but not necessarily the best."}
{"text":"Great sushi, great udon, love the booths, it's definitely a step above your average sushi place, but not 5-star sushi.  Been here at least 15 times, always happy with the food."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I chose this place from Yelp's list of sushi in the Beaches based on its rating and comments - the good reviews held true! Plus, the place was full of area locals when we arrived, which is always a good sign. The atmosphere is that of a 'typical' sushi restaurant, but had a sort of warmth and charm to it that was immediately recognizable.   I've been to many sushi restaurants in Toronto, and this is ranked among the top I've visited. The food was fresh, creatively plated, and full of good flavour. I noticed the care with which the salmon was cut, which other foodies will appreciate. The service was good, and the staff very friendly.   The only reason I've held back from a  perfect score is that the food was priced at the higher end for sushi. While the food was delicious, and I will definitely return, a 5/5 would require something unique and special, something different. Overall, a great spot!"}
{"text":"This is the freshest sushi in Toronto! Priced high however well worth it based on the quality.  Try the Mandu soup and the best hand rolls in the city. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Loved everything about this place!  Food: The sushi was excellent, for the value, the best I've had in Toronto.We had a combo sushi platter with a maki roll, sushi, and sashmi.  Very very fresh with a nice texture, and not pre-frozen and also not chewy tasting like a lot of sushi I've had recently (esp. sashimi). The miso soup and green salad that came with it were properly made and delicious. The uni sashimi is amazing as well.   Service: Very attentive and always checking up/available. They quickly re-filled water and seem to genuinely care about the customers and food. The owner/chef walked around helping and chatting with customers.  Atmosphere: Typical authentic sushi bar decor, but with nice looking private booths and seats right at the sushi bar (I'd sit there next time!). It was just casual enough to visit after a day at the beaches but could be just nice enough for a date night as well.   Can't wait to go again"}
{"text":"I only gave this a 4 star because it is not authentic Japanese but rather Korean owned. But the food is excellent, fresh and service polite and friendly."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the better sushi places in Toronto, at least it's one of the best I've been to out of many, many sushi joints.   Everything is fresh and the presentation is beautiful. The premium rolls are absolutely ginormous and so nice to look at that it's almost hard to eat them.  We tried the Sashimi dinner as well as 4 maki rolls, so we had a great selection.   Yumei is a small place which probably seats 30 or so, they have 3 private Japanese style booths and the other tables are open. They also have a few Korean dishes on the menu (dolsot bibimbap and bulgogi).  Service was friendly albeit a wee bit slow. Food A++"}
{"text":"Definitely worth a visit and the money!   Food: I'm going to list the items that were ordered.  1. We started with a huge bowl of salad (larger than the average ones you'd get from other Toronto sushi restaurants).  2. Shrimp and veggie tempura. Wow, I'm not a fan of Tempura at all because you never get to taste the shrimp, but this was not the case here. First, the shrimp was thin and large and the batter is so light and crispy that the shrimp can be tasted. I later find out that the shrimp they use are imported from Thailand. The veggies were typical.  3. Sashimi boat consisting of salmon belly, red tuna, white fish, yellow tail. All very fresh! You need to try these if you love sushi. I've read previous reviews and those that say these are mediocre - ha... They may not know what actual fresh fish taste like - you pay what you get. This place is definitely on pricier side but once you realize that the chef gets these, particularly the yellowtail, from Japan.. There's no way these aren't amazing. 4. Spicy age tofu - hot and delicious! Great started dish to kick off your taste buds 5. Grilled yellowtail cheek - first time ever having this, super crispy and delicious. The neat part is that the smaller bones can be eaten with the meat and is healthy for you. The veggies that came next to the fish were too salty for my likings but the others thought it was okay. Perhaps I'm overly sensitive go salt.  6. Kimchi pancake - I love kimchi, but I found this to be very average. I think it's hard to screw up kimchi pancake so if you get a bad review from me on kimchi pancakes... That just means you've over-battered it or put very little kimchi in it.  7. seafood u-don - huge and sharable. Not salty, hot, and loads of flavour! Definitely recommend if you want noodles. Next time, I'm going to try the soba noodles.   Service: Spectacular! The owner truly cares for his customers and knows the regular locals. Chef Young comes around the tables to check up on everything and willingly takes offers on a shot or drinks with them! He teaches you some facts about the dish like eating the white radish with the sashimi aiding in digestion - preventing upset stomachs. He also lived in Japan for a few years prior to opening here and his work in Toronto reminds me of Jiro. Why? Because he himself goes to the fish market to pick his fish haha. He works every night - can't always say that about other owners who choose to take days off.   Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty expensive compared to the other sushi restaurants. I will admit that the fish is very fresh though, but seriously overpriced. I ordered the sashimi donburi, it had a lot of lettuce in it and a good decent amount of fish. the fish that were given to me was mostly salmon belly which was super fat and really delicious, few pieces of tuna. All combos come with soup salad and a really small noodle seafood broth soup thing.   My friend got the chef Bento box which I think was way overpriced. It came with a few tempura items such as shrimp and yam, A California roll, a choice of teriyaki meat, six pieces of Sashimi, which was $24. I think you can get a much better deal when you're up north.  Service is great the waiters are attentive and there's a lot of seating and it is very spacious."}
{"text":"I have known Mr. Lee for almost 30 yrs.  I followed him around as he moved as he always had the best fish.  I have been coming here since he opened and IMHO, it is among the best sushi restaurants in Toronto."}
{"text":"This is a reasonable place for sushi. I'm vegetarian and can't comment on the fish itself. My partner liked it though. I had the vegetarian signature maki which was very good. Service is friendly and fast. The menu has too many items in my opinion. They should focus on what they do best and not add everything to the list. Why would you come to this place to eat a steak?"}
{"text":"I'm happy to report that it seems as though Yumei has gotten it's act together. I just had a great dinner there tonight, after a very long hiatus. I see that my previous review was written in Oct. 3, 2016, almost a year ago. It's literally taken me that long to build up the courage to give it another try. I'll admit my my previous rating was unfair and reactionary because it was based on a few bad experiences (which were all in a row). I'm not sure what happened during that time period last year. Maybe the regular chef was on vacation or something. Overall I've had very good meals there, so the rating should reflect that. I guess it just goes to show you how important consistency is, especially with something like sushi.   Anyway, tonight I started with the maguro sushi and it was delicious this time. Carefully prepared, very fresh and jewel-red, like it should be. For the main dish I had the Chicken Bibimbap, which they've always managed to get right. The beer was ice cold and served with a frosted mug. The miso soup and salad appetizers were also good. So, Yumei has redeemed itself and I'm desperately hoping it stays that way. There are so few restaurants in The Beaches that I can count on. If the quality keeps up, I'll tack on another star."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi. Everything is made right in front of you and tastes so fresh. The employees greet you when you walk in and they all say goodbye when you leave. Very friendly atmosphere. Would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"I've been to many sushi places in the city and none of them come close to Yumei.  This is simply the best sushi place in Toronto.  Yung, the owner, is an amazing person and runs his place with the precision of a surgeon.  All the staff are extremely friendly and the all the menu items are sheer perfection.  Outstanding attention to detail and consistency in the menu items.  Alway super fresh and made to order.  Nothing is every waiting to be served - they make it all fresh.   The chicken yakitori is the best I've ever had as is the soy mien soup.   I love this place and will always recommend it to anyone looking for great sushi."}
