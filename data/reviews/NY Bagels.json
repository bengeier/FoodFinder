{"text":"Huge disappointment. I'm from New York and grew up eating bagels. Bagels were not doughy at all and very thin. I ordered a bagel and lox, which was $9 with tax, and I got 2 slices of lox. Huge waste of money, not going back"}
{"text":"Subpar bagel. They were out of just about everything and it was still early in the morning. Honestly a store bought bagel over at Safeway is going to taste better and save you money"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place. Always room for a good bagel place. To be honest I am not sure how long they have been open, so we may need to give them time to improve.   I ordered just a plain oat bagel, toasted with cream cheese. It was so dry, tough. Not chewy and toasty. I am guessing it was part because it was an oat bagel, but it also tasted old.  Also they only offered plain cream cheese. If you are going to call yourself NY bagel, I expect to see wonderful cream cheese options, almost like you are walking into a gelato shop.  Lastly, I think what makes them 'NY' is their offering of lox. I think it should include so many more things-a really good egg salad as an example.  Lastly, their other offerings are blah at best. Another grilled chicken sandwich? I can get that anywhere. What can they do that makes them stand out from the million of other sandwich places in the area around them? They need to find their voice...and as I said that may come as they mature.  Very nice people, beautiful space and close to campus."}
{"text":"Very standard Breakfast Bagel ~$6. Not exceptionally friendly staff but good enough for a quick bite in the morning.   Cheers"}
{"text":"Love their bialys. Always very quick and in my opinion better than Einstein!! Prices are very reasonable as well."}
{"text":"I used to not be a big fan of bagels, but after trying NY Bagels N'Bialys' green pepper cheddar bagel, I became a huge fan! All of the store bought ones I tried in the past were too doughy, rubbery, or bready. I also purchased their deli sandwiches. They ran out of pastrami, but they made corned beef instead. Still delicious. Their New York egg cream is not as sweet as Chompie's, but there is always room for improvement. Will return."}
{"text":"The bagels didn't inspire much in either my kids or me. They were sort of overly dense and lacking in flavor. We all got \"Eggels\" which are bagel sandwiches with eggs and some meat and cheese. Just average. Friendly staff though. Probably would've been better to get breakfast quesadillas at Taco Bell a few doors away."}
{"text":"I am from New York, and of course I did not expect the bagels to taste as good as a NY bagel. However, that was truly one of the worst bagels I have ever eaten and extremely overpriced. I will not be returning to this establishment ever again."}
{"text":"This place has some serious potential. Amazing location and students can always use a breakfast/lunch spot. I stopped in this morning on my way to class because I was craving a bagel. I came in and got a plain bagel and then decided to try a Vanilla Latte. Really the bagel was terribly disappointing, and it even tasted like onion. It was very dry, stiff and just not good. The latte was also a disappointment, unfortunately. It tasted nothing like vanilla. In fact it tasted very nutty, like peanut butter. I think it's crazy that both things I ordered didn't even taste like what they were!  I gave two stars because the staff was super friendly and gave swift service. Hopefully they improve because I would love to come back!"}
{"text":"Woman that works there (owns it?) has a horrible attitude. It's clearly understaffed and customers have to wait while this woman takes orders/makes food at the same time. I gave it a chance twice and I won't be doing it again. While the mismanaged way it's run is a put off, the deal breaker is the rudeness of the only person that works there. Not the way you treat customers if you want business"}
