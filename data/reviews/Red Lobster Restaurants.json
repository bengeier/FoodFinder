{"text":"Dined here twice over two days (Was staying at a nearby hotel and I adore fish!)  The first visit was the better experience, Ordered the Seaside Shrimp Trio with a Sunset Strawberry smoothie.  Friendly waitress that actually engaged conversation with us. The meal arrived at a decent pace.  One thing about Red Lobster I've always found though, their Caesar salad is just awful, but I digress. The meal was great (though their breaded shrimp was extremely dry, unusual for that to be like that).  2nd visit, The staff just seemed so disinterested, I barely had time to even touch my salad before the main course was served (Ordered the Haddock and Chips, with a Lava Cookie Dessert, not on the speed lunch menu) and was just tucked away in a corner with no sight of any staff after the food was served.   In the end I had to hunt for a staff member to actually pay for my meal, couldn't see my original server anywhere, ended up paying via the bartender).  1st visit - 4 stars.  2nd visit - 2 stars. That was not a pleasant experience.   So yeah, mileage will vary at this place I guess. If it helps, 1st visit was at Dinner, 2nd was at a lunch time."}
{"text":"I had the special 4 course meal.  I was starving so anything would be good, right?  Wrong.  First up was the soup...there was barely any.  I drank that in 1 second flat.  Second meal was the Caesar salad...it was so salty that I finished my drink after the first few bites.  Then it was the main course - I had the shrimp pasta with alfredo...again, it was so salty that I finished my second drink in no time.  Then I was too full from my 2 drinks to have my lemon cake dessert.    I guess I should of ordered the lobster but hey, the ice tea was good, at least.  I drank 2 glasses of it!!"}
{"text":"A - List - Recommended. Excellent food. Great Service. Always busy. The food is rich. Beware! If that is what you are looking for, these guys do it pretty well."}
{"text":"This huge franchise isn't one I would usually cover but thought I should just because of the NON experience I had there.    I was recently given two $25 coupons to dine there and thought I should do the romantic dinner thing with my better half.  I mean the word lobster conjures up the mouth watering sensation, plus it is always such a luxury to indulge in.  When we arrived there, there was a line up and the hostess was so noncommittal in seating us, that we waited for our table in front of a very busy highway which did not set any sort of tone for an evening that would be memorable.    We were finally accompanied through a maze of tables and were seated beside a very noisy Italian international mens' soccer team.  It was hard to concentrate on the menu and it was very difficult to hear what the waiter was recommending to us.  So I decided on some lobster package not because it was what I wanted, just because it was the most convenient and seemed like something that didn't need to be explained to us twice and on deaf ears.  The food eventually came out, quite a long wait maybe 20 minutes and again so uneventful in presentation and in taste. It was the driest lobster I have ever had in my life and the spices and sauce that accompanied it was; I can't remember, again the word uneventful.  This yelper things franchise restaurants like this have to try harder to bring in the client, there is far too much competition in this city from local and private restaurants that provide you with that extra special romantic and unforgettable meal.  I forgot so much about this experience that I just remembered to include it now after 70 reviews.  Thank goodness I had free coupons, because I will not return there to spend my hard earned cash."}
{"text":"So I know that all the people who live on the coast are going to scold me for what I'm about to say, but I'm saying it anyways... I LOVE RED LOBSTER!  What started out as a New Year 's Day tradition slowly turned into a full blown obsession.  I just love gong to Red Lobster for all my seafood needs.  Okay, okay, I'll admit that I always order the same meal every time I go to this place, but why change what isn't broken, right?  I always get the Ultimate Feast because it has everything I love; lobster tail, crab legs, garlic shrimp, breaded coconut shrimp and my choice of sides.  Red Lobster is the only restaurant where I know I'll be finishing everything on my plate, including the garnish!  Honestly, if it were up to me, I would eat at Red Lobster every week, but I know I shouldn't.  Not only would I be the size of a whale, but I'd be pretty broke as well.  I find the meals to be a little more expensive than they should be, which is why I make this a special occasion place.  I wish it was just a little bit cheaper to eat there.  One thing I really enjoy about Red Lobster is the little beepers they give you signalling when you're table is ready.  I've only seen this in a couple other places but first experienced it at Red Lobster.  So, if you don't want to sit around in the restaurant waiting for your table you can wait outside, in your car or just take a walk around.  I usually make my way to the bar for a couple of pre-dinner drinks while I wait for my table.  It's a nice way to pass the time.  Seriously, I love Red Lobster so much that I'm probably going to have to go have dinner there tonight.  I'm craving it really badly right now.  Mmm, mmm good!"}
