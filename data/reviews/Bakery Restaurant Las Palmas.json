{"text":"This restaurant received great reviews and that's why we tried it. 'My husband  and I always find good food at the \"whole in the wall\" places. My husbands meal was decent however mine was extremely salty- It was the tilapia. It looked delicious but not edible.I was disappointed and upset I had to pay for something I couldn't eat."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to try this place out yesterday.
Being honest I was not impressed at all. I read the reviews before we go and was expecting way more than what we got.
The empanada was okay, for entree we both decided on carne assada that came with salad, rice, beans and plantain, I asked that waiter to switch the plantain for fried cassava and she said that she couldn't. ???? The food was just regular. We also order pork crackling that was way over cooked and over seasoned.  
The place it is simple which is no big deal but wasn't clean the way it was supposed to be and a huge spider jumped on my lap while I was eating. 
The waitress was very attentive only down side was she looked not to be familiar with the menu. In my opinion the food is WAY overpriced for what we get. This being said we will not be back.
That being sad we won't be back."}
{"text":"The waitress Gabby, was slow and took forever to bring our drinks.  We ordered our dishes. After 10 minutes we were told one of their newer dishes weren't available and they could not substitute the beef dish I ordered with chicken.  I don't eat beef and they couldn't make a simple accommodation. The waitress apologized but seemed to think it was funny. May we just weren't \"ethnic\" enough for service. I will never go back and I urge everyone else to not visit as well."}
{"text":"The service was great! The empanadas were amazing! The chicken was a little to thin. The beans were by far the best beans I've ever had! Definitely should be on your list of places to try! There was little to no wait time for the food to be brought out hot and fresh!"}
{"text":"I have no idea what type of bakery this place is portraying to be. But with 100% certainty they are NOT Colombians! And therefore you will not find any good empanadas, pan de bono, arepas, or even good cafe con leche. 

The empanadas were disgusting and very tiny! I couldn't determine what was inside them. The cafe con leche was horrible!!! It was like hotel American coffee! 

How on earth can people give this place more than one star is beyond me! Then again they have nothing to compare it to so to them this is probably an amazing bakery. 

NOTHING in this bakery is Colombian so don't be fooled. They microwave EVERYTHING! And please do not order any coffee, it sucks."}
{"text":"This is my ideal breakfast spot, which is ideal because it's right across the street from my home. 

I recommend you either be familiar with Columbian food or adventurous, because the menu is comprised of dishes and ingredients slightly foreign to someone raised on a typical American diet of chili dogs and chicken nuggets.  

For a simple breakfast, you can't beat the freshly made empanadas and a cup strong Columbian coffee. 

Since it's a bakery and a restaurant, there is a large selection of fresh baked breads, cookies and pastries. I recommend a piece of Tres Leches cake."}
{"text":"Wow! Now this is why I love Yelp. A picture of a cup of coffee on Yelp led me to look this place up. Colombian food? In Gastonia? I was there two hours later. Okay, so they have an actual selection of Colombian sodas!! Not to mention a bakery section with home baked breads and pastries.
To start, I tried the empanadas. The shredded beef and potato filling was good but the wrappers seemed a little ready made/prefabricated. My main course, the Plato Tipico, was awesome. It's basically a platter of every protein you can think of. Rice with a poached egg, chorizo sausage, pork cracklings, a steak, red beans, fried plantains, an avocado, and a dense tortilla/corn cake. My waitress said it would be filling and she was right!!! I can hibernate now. When I asked her how long they've been open, she said eight years!!!! Holy schnikees!! How has no one reviewed this place yet? Well there you have it!! If you're passing through Gastonia and want to try something new, this is your place!!"}
{"text":"I walked up to the bakery and tried the empanadas. It was my first time. It was hot and fresh and was filled with potatoes and beef. I got several to go and it came with a spicy sauce. It was DELICIOUS!!!! I will definitely com back and try their breakfast and Colombian coffee."}
{"text":"This place is very unsuspecting, but a great find! I stopped in for breakfast and was greeted by the pastry case filled with unique confections.
You must try the beef and potato empanadas, cheese bread (soooo good), and any of the guava filled pastries.

If Las Palmas was in Uptown Charlotte they would never been empty... I don't think Gastonia can really appreciate a place like this, so if you're in the area you should definitely swing by. Not to mention breakfast was really cheap. I got 3 empanadas and 2 pastries for under $5!

Staff was super nice too."}
{"text":"Delicious pastries & empanadas! The sweet empanadas with guava & cream cheese are my favorite. Super nice staff."}
{"text":"A bit off the beaten path, but a worthy find. They have great empanadas."}
{"text":"Food was good, never would have known this place if it was not for Michael on help. We ate around 2pm today and I am not hungry at all. Bathroom was clean that is a plus in my book. We got a dozen empanadas to go. Only down side for us was no tea or non sugar drinks, but I did have mango juice and it was delicious. Blink and you will miss this place just follow the directions on yelp. I LOVE YELP."}
{"text":"We have passed this place so many times and finally tried lunch there. Delicious! I love the beef empanadas and the spicy sauce that comes on the side. It's nice to see different types of authentic restaurants in Gastonia when you don't want burgers, fried chicken, or buffets."}
{"text":"This is a fabulous, locally owned restaurant.  I love it for the wonderful food, pastries, and Colombian drinks.  I try and bring the kids here as much as possible to broaden their taste buds.  I cannot recommend this place enough."}
