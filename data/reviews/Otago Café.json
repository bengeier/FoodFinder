{"text":"What a pleasant surprise to find this place in the middle of a commercial/industrial area of town. You'd expect to find a collection of burger joints in such a location, but Otago is a diamond in the rough. The menu is full of   health salads and other freshly prepared options.   I had a whole grain quinoa salad and a salmon pizza, both of which were delish. There is also a juice bar that offers a selection of juices and smoothies."}
{"text":"Located in Ruby Foo hotel, I had the opportunity of eating here twice. The first time was for lunch which boasts an array of \"protein salads\". A nice selection to choose from, chicken, tuna, raw salmon etc. After being seated I waited a solid 10 minutes before someone rushed by with a menu, and it took an additional 15 minutes before someone took my order. I was pleased that the restaurant was booming with people, but they were completely understaffed to deal with the number of clients. Once my salad arrived (an Asian beef salad) it was pretty lack lustre. The beef was chewy and the salad had a watery mess on the plate which I believe was dressing?   The dinner is a completely different ball game. Firstly the masses of people are gone and the restaurant looks quite empty. The decor is quite nice and the menu is completely different from the lunch and has something for everyone; beef ribs, pizza, chicken etc. I opted for the salmon. When it arrived I was shocked at how small the fish was, it looked about the size of a candy bar. It was quite delicious (a little salty) but ultimately well prepared. After my plate I was still hungry but decided just to leave since I had been disappointed twice already."}
{"text":"In a sea of mediocre restaurants and big box food franchises, Otago is an island paradise in this industrial suburb.  The fare is fresh, feels healthy (ish) and most importantly, tastes delicious. And with a selection ranging from pizzas to panninis to Pad Thai, there's really something for everyone. Oh, and their smoothies are absolutely incredible.   Worth noting: since this is the best restaurant in a 5 block radius (think long, industrial blocks), it can get fairly busy. Try getting there before noon or after 1pm if you want to get a table quickly. Or if you want to eat back at the office, you can also take it to go."}
