{"text":"This coffee rocks!  We originally bought the regular beans at Sam's Club but they stopped carrying it (go figure).  Thankfully because of the internet, I found that Zavida had their own website, roasters, etc. so I was thrilled.  I purchase at least three 2-lbs bags at a time and with the last order, the shipper apparently severely damaged the box - one of the bags was slit with loose beans in the bottom and even beans in the re-taping of the exterior of the box.  I notified Zavida so they could bring it to their shipper's attention and their customer service is so great that Zavida shipped complimentary replacement beans to us.  I thought that was really upstanding and I tell everyone I know about the great coffee and ease of dealing with this company.  My only lament is that Toronto is so far away, I can't experience it in person.....yet.   Thank you."}
{"text":"Really bad cappuccinos. Weak espresso and poor foam that falls flat a moments after you get it. Tasted like a watery, milky black tea. Also the service is pretty rude. The barista did not say a word to me. Not even a simple greeting. Instead of telling me the price, just looked at me until I checked the total on the register and paid. Maybe that's why it was empty in there? Super weird. Didn't feel welcomed. Not coming back."}
{"text":"this place *used* to be mediocre at best. idk what happened (new management??) but this is by far my fav coffee place in toronto now.  their sandwiches are just so great. the breakfast sandwich is super fresh and made with real ingredients, and doesn't make you feel sick after.  their iced drinks are all super great.  the service is wonderful too... everyone is friendly. look forward to coming here every morning."}
{"text":"Daily routine. Hands down the best cold coffee in Toronto, period. Staff are phenomenal. Food is delicious and sufficiently varied and original. All pastries and sandwiches recommended. Cheese croissant is my fave.   They seem to be getting a bit busier, but waits are still minimal. I'm always a little torn -- do we want to see this relatively low key \"hidden gem\" (ish) cafe maintain this status or continue to thrive and grow? Hard to begrudge the latter. Thanks to Zavida and staff for being amazing every morning. I am officially a fanboy."}
{"text":"Ordered a white Belgium mocha! It was fair price compared to Starbucks but so much better.  They used organic milk and added real white Belgium chocolate pieces to milk as it was being frothed.   The staff was friendly but they could've used another barista. The wait was longer than other coffee shops but as I mentioned they use real chocolate for the mocha instead of just syrup.  Definitely recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"Clean and pretty interior coupled with aromatic coffee. It was by chance that we walked past this place and decided to chill there. Got the Sea Salt Belgian Mocha which had an interesting taste as there was a good balance of sweet and salty, perfect for those craving for something satisfying. They are known for their organic coffee beans and interesting flavours. Free WIFI available and you can also purchase their teas/coffee in the store."}
{"text":"Classy café in the city. Great service along with great coffee. They have it all; wifi, pasteries, and friendly smiles. Everything about this place is tastefully done."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's clean, cozy and stylish. Often I have to rely on Americanos because the drip coffee is weak, but here the dark roast drip coffee has the boldness I yearn for. The staff is the very best feature of the place. Everyone of the staff is welcoming and helpful.    The pastries are good if you like heavy rich pastries, if I could change anything I'd say more variety of pastries, smaller in size and from local bakeries.   The coffee, atmosphere and service are top notch, and they are environmentally conscious!"}
{"text":"If you're in the area and need a coffee or snack, I highly recommend this little cafe! 100x better than Starbucks or Tims in all aspects, IMHO. The only coffee place better in the area would be Jimmys - but I'd even say that the service at Zavida is better! The staff working there always greet you with a smile and are happy to answer your questions about their drinks or menu. There is one guy in particular who works weekday mornings and he will put a smile on your face! :)  You will need to keep an eye out for it! (It is on the ground floor level of the Aura building, which has Marshalls and Bed, Bath and Beyond. You need to access it from Yonge Street.) The baked goods are always fresh and delicious! My favourites are the chocolate baton, banana nut muffin and deluxe cookie! I notice there are rarely any seats available, which I'd say is a good sign! Also, they are on the Ritual app, which is awesome!!"}
{"text":"Beligian Mocha!!! One of the best coffees I have had?  The baked goods are the best specially the ones with chocolate!!"}
{"text":"During this past mother's day, I stopped by with my mother after shopping at the Marshalls above. As I am from the US, I was hoping to find a nice small coffee shop instead of the usual Starbucks. I walked in and instantly fell in love with the décor. The set up from the beans to the food case was very clean and organized. The cashier that was working was very respectful and was the only person who spoke directly to my mother who is hearing impaired the entire day. That really stood out for me as this is sadly unusual. She was also very nice in engaging my mother in conversation on her bright red hair while I was deciding on what to order. She wasn't dismissive and was very respectful to my mother. There were two guys who were making our drinks who were also just as nice and was very catering to our needs. My overall experience on this day was above amazing. I am visiting again in the city, and I saw the same cashier on the street. She proceeded to tell me that she no longer works for the company, however new items were introduced to the menu that I should try. I bought one of the cold pressed juices and I can say that it was one of the best tasting juices that I have ever tried. It was very fresh and I could tell that a lot went into the drink. Although it is slightly on the more expensive side, it is definitely worth the cost. Whatever the manager is doing to have such amazing staff and an amazing menu, I hope she/he sticks to as this café is a quality café!"}
{"text":"Slightly on the pricey side for a generic chain coffee/bakery place, but other than that, no complaints.  The staff here are always extremely helpful and friendly.  I go here frequently and cannot recall a single bad interaction.  The coffee is delicious; it's the same stuff they sell at Costco (and honestly is probably the only reason I keep my membership there).  Free WiFi is fast and reliable and they never make you feel like you overstay your welcome."}
{"text":"Sorry, Zavida, I really tried to like you, but this is my second visit and your brewed coffee is one of the worst I've ever had. I tried the dark roast during my last visit and wasn't a fan, so I ordered a medium roast today, thinking that perhaps it would be kinder to my palate. I took one sip and the first thing I noticed was a weird ashy/smoky aftertaste. The rest of my experience wasn't any better. The coffee was so bitter and unpleasant to drink that I couldn't even finish it (and neither could my partner).   This makes me sad, Zavida! I really love this location and it has everything I need for a good productive study session: reliable free wifi, plenty of power outlets, music playing at a low volume, a decent number of tables. Plus it has the cleanest bathrooms I've ever seen at a coffee shop. Fine, I guess I'll have to give you another chance... Perhaps I'll have better luck with your espresso-based drinks."}
{"text":"Everything I want in a coffee shop - good coffee, friendly staff, clean well spaced tables, free strong wifi and a nice atmosphere. (Fyi, I came here at 9pm so it wasn't crowded)"}
{"text":"After I drew my concerns regarding the service and poorly made beverages, the management quickly contacted me and promised me that the service AND drinks will be better.  They were not kidding! Quality of service went from average to excellent, and drinks taste a lot better.  William, the owner and CEO of Zavida Coffee Roasters, puts tremendous amount of effort in this store and you can tell just by looking at beautiful selections of pastries and new menus.   He is very passionate, caring and intelligent individual who knows how to run the business.   I started to use their loyalty card and go to this place everyday to grab my daily caffeine intake. Coffee is still OK (not the best in Toronto but still acceptable).    Definitely recommended, and it is one of the best coffee shop in Toronto."}
{"text":"This is a cute small coffee shop in the aura building. Promotes itself as a  healthy cafe. Food offerings include protein balls, quiche, salad oatmeal. Reasonable prices.   The coffee is nice. Better than star bucks but not as good as Fahrenheit coffee. I bought a bottle of pressed juice and yes it was good. But at over 12$, I was inspired to go and buy a ninja bullet and make my own juices. Crazy expensive.   The iced tea unsweetened was refreshing. Overall I would visit here over timmys or Starbucks anyday. Just maybe not for juice"}
{"text":"Great little cafe with a nice atmosphere. Got some indie jazz pop (idk) music that had some good vibes. Belgian white hot chocolate was very sweet. Iced mocha was awesome. Both were $5 each. They use some of that real chocolate. Hazelnut croissant was alright. Very flaky and sweet.   Wil come again for a nice chat with a friend."}
{"text":"Was looking for a small corner style roaster.  And the word roaster, to me, designates a hard core coffee shop that actually roars their beans at the location. This place is much more of a corporate place like Starbucks.  But the latte was actually really mellow and good, even though it was from an automatic machine.  Maybe the beans are just good and fresh."}
{"text":"Great environment, friendly staff.  First time trying out their coffee frrida, tim hortons iced cap.  it is less sweet, and very icy. I dont mind it. will come back and try their coffee some day."}
{"text":"A nice quiet cafe near school that's great for studying during exam season. The coffee and quiche are great."}
{"text":"Belgian mocha is to die for!! Love the chocolate they use, unlike others (Tim's) who give watered down versions...worth the splurge but not something I'd do frequently.  Friendly staff and love the decor!"}
{"text":"Located at the bottom of the Aura building, this Cafe is a convenient place to grab a coffee and a delicious croissant.    The chocolate baton is super delicious, crispy and buttery.   They have vegan protein balls for sale as well.  Additional $0.50 for non dairy milk alternatives.  There is a small and basic patio with tables for one or two people.   I'll definitely come back for coffee and treats."}
{"text":"One of the best non-chain coffee places downtown. Coffee is great, but they also have really good espresso drinks. I also like the fact that they dont charge for adding flavoured syrups (if they still do). Pastries also seem tasty, Ive tried the chocolate danish which was great. But overall a really nice place to study, or to just sit down for a cup of coffee."}
{"text":"Walk by here quite often, decided to pop in here today to take a look.  First impression is that the space is slightly rustic but very clean and new. The white desk and chairs are adorable and the space is great for working. They have complimentary wifi access for 1 hr but I didn't see any plugs around unfortunately.   I scanned thru the menu and saw their buttered coffee with coconut oil. I have always heard of buttered coffee but never had it. The owner( I assumed) was very passionate and said it was fairly popular since it was launched few months ago.   I decided to try it, and it was AMAZING. The slight coconut flavor added a lot of warmth to the drink. I would definitely come back and order this again !"}
{"text":"Having seen the coffee beans sold by Zavida at most stores I was intrigued by this cafe. I have only tried their coffee beans at home once and wasn't impressed. However this place is convenient enough for me to try them out once. The setup is a bit odd as it does get quite tight around the counter area though the area in front is fine.  The desserts looked tempting so might stop by for those.  We had a tea and a cappuccino.  Here is the verdict  Espresso: weak Crema': couldn't tell Milk: Frothed poorly Latte Art: N/A A very poor attempt at a cappuccino maybe their beans are roasted for brew coffee but this was just a poor poor attempt at a cappuccino. I won't be back for a cappuccino for sure."}
{"text":"Small, pretty shop. Not a lot of seats because the clientele here will definitely be squatters. Service was friendly. My green tea latte took at least 5 minutes to make so keep that in mind if you're in a hurry; there were no customers ahead or behind me. Got to choose almond milk which I appreciate. Good temperature to the drink (Starbucks always too cold) and not too sweet. Would go back."}
{"text":"I'm not normally wowed by people, but the staff here (William) was incredibly helpful and awesome! I needed a whole bunch of baked good for a meeting on really short notice and trusted him to put everything together. There wasn't a crumb left!  Chill vibe, super staff, excellent bakery! Highly recommend! A new fav for me!"}
{"text":"small but clean. patio outside is a nice touch. iced coffee and bottled coffee was actually really good. dark but not bitter."}
{"text":"Zavida! I keep saying zazida. My bad. I came here around 9AM on a weekday and the store had very few people but they had their fair share of people picking up their daily coffee to go. I got the whole fruit iced tea which was (stated by my friend) a blend of 9 real fruit. The barista suggested syrup but I don't like super sweet drinks so I got it without. And I will say the drink was very, VERY tarte. I don't like sour fruit but I still drink the whole thing because hashtag healing properties! Anyways, if that drink contained only real fruit and had no extra perservatives and whatnot, the price was certainly justified. I do believe that teas should taste good unsweetend (despite tasting best sweetened). So personally, it's not my cup of (iced) tea!  Service was good, the place was relatively empty so it seems like a good place to study, chill, and meet up in the morning time. I am excited to try their coffee other reviews have been raving about!"}
{"text":"I love this place I don't understand what people expect from a coffee place, specially when they complain of staff laughing and being funny between themselves. Should we be all bitter and unhappy like some elite reviewers that only write whatever crosses their minds to get Elite status and badges?!? Anyway enough talking about the haters they don't count. I come here almost every day as I live across the street where're there are plenty of options for coffee like chains, supermarket, small little cafes but this place is simply the best! Great decor, nice music, only 1 hour wi-finwhich makes it perfect to not have to wait for a table because students grab 1 coffee and spend all day there. Their selections of croissant it's amazing! I love the chocolate baton, the hazelnut croissant and the almondine. Absolutely love love love them I can't talk enough about them, I wish they delivery, I know I'm just across the street but would be fantastic to wake up in my pjs and have breakfast waiting for me outside. Definitely recommended. Ps also love the protein balls, yogurt parfait and their freshly squeezed orange juice that comes in a glass jar (healthier) for only $9."}
{"text":"Lovely little coffee shop just off the beaten path. The seed and fruit granola is lovely and the coffee is great too. A nice escape from the hustle. Certainly recommend!"}
{"text":"Love the Belgian mocha and pastries are tasty, but one suggestion is maybe consider buying coffee stoppers for those that are on the go and are worried their beverage might spill. Other than that, great place. Their WiFi is not unlimited anymore, it's only for one hour now!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  I came here for lunch last week after I read all the great reviews.  The baristas(manager?) were super friendly and walked me through their food options.  Tbh, they don't have many lunch items - sandwiches (~$7), soups (~$4), etc.  I ended up getting the Chicken Noodle Soup ($3.95), and paired it with the highly rated Belgian Mocha ($3.95) and Chocolate Baton ($3.25).  The Chicken Noodle Soup was decent - it had fresh celery and carrots chopped up; however, there were no noodles and not much chicken.  The Chocolate Baton was really good - filled with lots of milk chocolate - you'll like it if you like chocolate.  The best of the bunch was the Belgian Mocha.  I've never had a drink quite like it.  It was uber chocolatey and not too bitter like most mocha's tend to be.  The owner explained to me that they mix the chocolate in with the milk so that the drink doesn't even require any extra sugar.  Service was top-notch.  The manager checked up on me during my meal to make sure everything was good.  Additionally, as I was leaving, he showed me their copper pot they use to process cane sugar for the syrup they use to sweeten their drinks.  This is especially cool to me, because I'm fairly health conscious and try to use alternative sweeteners when possible.  I believe most of their products are \"organic\" and they claim on their cups that they plant a tree for every 10 drinks sold.  The wifi here was pretty good too, and there were a bunch of students here, so I'm guessing it's a fairly popular study spot.  The only negatives were the limited seating (only about 10 tables in total) and limited food menu.  Will def. be back to Zavida.  They provide relatively healthy, organic products, attentive service, and a comfy environment."}
{"text":"My favorite coffee shop in Toronto, other thank good coffee, they make the best freshly cracked egg sandwich. And their pastries are amazing too.  You feel welcomed whenever you walk into Zavida."}
{"text":"This place definitely deserves 5 stars.   Great service every time I come here. The space is so nice, cute decor, comfy tables and chairs, and lots of space. WIFI as well of course. It's a great quiet place to study, much better alternative than the Starbucks down the street which tends to get very busy.   You have to try their Belgian Mocha. I got it iced and it was so thick, rich, and delicious. Perfect amount of sweetness. They also have a great selection of pastries, breakfast/ lunch options, and other desserts."}
{"text":"To be honest, I wasn't expecting such high-quality coffee so close to the downtown core (mind you, there are *some* good ones). It's the best brewed coffee I've had (the Private Stock is their lightest roast, and my go-to) and I never get brewed unless I'm at Starbucks or Tim's. Price is a-ok ($2.00 for a small, comparable size to a Tall).   I've had their croissants, and they're pretty good too. A croissant and small coffee came to just under $5. Decent number of seats, but its a small cafe and usually fills up pretty quickly since its located so close to UofT and Ryerson.   Staff are friendly - not super chatty but cordial enough. Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"As a resident in Aura building, My sister and I have been visiting this place since the cafe opened. I can't count how many times I visited here and I can tell it is my favourite cafe! I love the atmosphere and nice environment in this cafe. I have not tried sandwiches and breakfast manu, but tried most of the baked goods here. I love their chocolate baton and croissant!  I usually have Iced Americano, Iced vanilla latte, frozen hot chocolate, and belgian chocolate.  Food 5/5 I just love their baked goods. I always recommend their croissant, blueberry scones and chocolate baton to anyone I know. My mom loves their croissant, so every time I go there I buy them with blueberry scones.  Drinks 3/5 Their coffee is quite good but not the best. I sometimes had diluted iced americano, but could not ask to remake it because I am usually to-go person. Every time I order my drink, I try a sip before I leave this place. I used to love this drink because there is no place making good chocolate drink in Toronto cafe. However, last time I ordered it, the frozen hot chocolate was too sweet. I think they put too much chocolate powder and did not put enough milk. The taste was terrible so I had to throw it away after I had two more sips. I forgot to try a sip before I leave the cafe last time because they used to make a good frozen chocolate. Their drinks tastes are not stable for the most of the time. I think they should prove better tastes and quality of drinks.  Service 4/5 I don't understand when people say that they do not care about the staff's attitude towards customers. We don't expect much from them. We don't want staffs to laugh and being funny. What is the customer service for? It all comes from the staffs. Not all, but most of the customers expect welcoming atmosphere from a coffee place. And these customers usually return because their quality of service makes them feel happy and comfortable. That is why the customer service is important. Most of the staffs in Zavida are very friendly. They always greet me with a smile, which keeps me come back to this cafe. However, a few new staffs' attitudes are not very nice and sometimes I felt uncomfortable because they just throw a drink to me. Since I have a great customer service experience with other staffs and the manager, I know that they can fix this and do better. The new staffs should be trained well so that loyal customers can keep returning to the cafe."}
{"text":"Do not add a flavored shot.  I had the organic latte with a pumpkin spice shot, it was ok, nothing stood out.  My friend tried the ice coffee with hazelnut and it was just plan awful."}
{"text":"Love this place. Always drop by when I'm in the area. Cozy warm design and sweet coffee.. what ealse do you need? Wifi? It's available. Iced mocha is one of the best, recommend."}
{"text":"This place is sexy; subway tiles, exposed brick, mosaic panted floor tiles, rustic wood panels and of course all of this is dressed up with industrialized chick furnishings and decor. Yes, this is a place to hang out for hours... only if their coffee game was a little stronger -- okay, a lot stronger.  This place is a cafe-at-home person's paradise! With so many house blends and flavoured coffees; they even have flavoured coffee additives! Prices are reasonable and packaging is pretty. They go as far as offering a handful of specialty teas!  Now, on to the real stuff. Their coffee is dismiss-able at best. When I asked for medium roast, I don't mean a watered down dark roast (a-la-Starbucks). Coffee was reminiscent of Starbucks at best I would say; lacked body, no complexity, zero acidity, you don't really taste the beans as they are obviously over-roasted. One glance at the grinder and you will see a sight all too familiar - pitch black, oily beans. Beans of this darkness are best kept for espressos, cappucinos and the French press NOT drip coffee.  So from a self pro-claimed coffee affectionado, home barista and coffee roaster's perspective...this is a Starbucks alternative; which is really not coffee for a true coffee connoisseur but it is for the masses though.  1 star for excellent decor with style and for having great pastries!"}
{"text":"Not bad, but would not visit again. Their Belgian Mocha was way too sweet for me - it just tasted like thick melted chocolate near the midpoint of my drink. Their Western Breakfast Sandwich with Bacon was surprisingly small for the price ($4.50) - similar to a McDonald's value pick size - and not much better in taste, except that they use real cheese.   They do have a cute store environment with friendly staff in my experience though - good for sitting down."}
{"text":"Lovely place! I love the decoration and it's a bit hidden away from the busy yonge street, but lovely place"}
{"text":"Very cute and hidden coffee shop. With great coffee and snacks. Pastries and sandwiches are excellent.  Need to try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"I asked for for-here cup to be environmentally friendly. Ordered their organic café latte $3.25 (sm) and a chocolate baton $3.25 which the staff had kindly asked if I wanted it warmed up. It was noted on the menu that all coffee sources were organic..even the milk used in coffee! Store is small but cozy and relaxing, with bit vintage settings. I think they offer free wifi but you will need to ask the staff for password. The staff put an empty mug in front of me after I have paid..which I was bit confused because the whole time I was wondering why there is no coffee in the mug. (I later found out it actually said TIP on the mug in cursive writing...which showed how much I need coffee in the morning...sorry barista!!)"}
{"text":"I got a medium cold brew. First sip before adding milk and sugar, it was delicious. The taste is not sour like some hot coffee or watery like some other cold brews. I usually take my coffee with milk, but after this taste test, Im very content with drinking this black. Will definitely order again :)"}
{"text":"You can tell I'm not a fan of this place when I don't give a *** about my picture lol.   Anyhow, I don't get the rave reviews for this place. First of all the service was *** and unprofessional. Even the Starbucks across the street has better customer service. The cashier/barista didn't walk through the menu/their special offerings, and they started laughing at me?!   I was waiting for my drinks and they looked at me, and kept on laughing. Once they couldn't contain their laughter anymore they went to their little back room and closed the door. I went back 1 min later to ask for their wifi, and I can hear the staff laughed, clapped their hands and said \"see.\" I think my outfit and makeup looks normal today... I'm not dressing like a hippie at all... :(. So i don't know what were they laughing at!   Ok onto their drink..... The Belgian mocha tasted like sweetened hot chocolate to me and I'm not a fan of it.   P/S: they give you a code for their wifi but you can only use it on one device - meaning you can't use the same code for your phone and laptop."}
{"text":"Fantastic place for coffee and breakfast!  On a trip with family and staying at the Chelsea Hotel.  Didn't want the expensive brunch and lucked into Zavida.  Great coffee and delicious croissants and egg sandwiches (made by the super friendly owner, William!).  Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"One of my favouriteeee cold brews in the city - very potent! Or maybe it is just me but I am always flying high on caffeine after ordering cold brew here, which I can't say for all CB's(cold brews ;)).  Zavida Coffee Roasters is tucked away at the bottom of a high-rise in an awkwardly shaped space. Whenever I find myself in need of caffeine and in the area I like to come here over the Tim's and SB's alternatives... especially in the summer! I have always gotten my coffee to go, but I wouldn't be opposed to sticking around inside, or outside. In the summer they have a few tables and seats just outside their door, usually shaded due to the buildings. The café is tastefully decorated and despite the awkward shape of space they made it work really well. They have a selection of traditional baked goods which I have never tried but I noticed upon my last visit that they have a cooler now selling different items... like fruit loop milk :D?!?!?... for $8 maybe next time. It is a good thing it wasn't lucky charm milk or I probably would have dished out the $$. Summer is around the corner so I am looking forward to stopping in for more Zavida caffeine highs soon!!"}
{"text":"Rare source of excellent coffee in downtown core. Knowledgeable staff and excellent service. Reminiscent of the independent coffee houses in Europe or Anzac. Try the deluxe cookie."}
{"text":"One of THE BEST lattes I have ever had in the city! Got a mocha latter which is their signature latte and most popular. Also had a chocolate pastry and it was so good.   I will definitely be going back again."}
{"text":"Hands down best cookie I ever had. I was recommended this place by a friend, especially to try their cookie. They have a bunch actually but all you have to say is I wand THE cookie. They spent three years perfecting the recipe. The crunchiness, the consistency, the amount of chocolate vs macadamia. It was to the perfection.  Have it warm and enjoy few min of pure happiness"}
{"text":"I just want to thanks Zavida's management for reading my Yelp review and contact me privately.   This is definitely good customer service. I received an apology and an offer for a complimentary beverage for my next visit. He also assured that it would not happen to other customer again.  Maybe I would give them another try."}
{"text":"Very relaxing Cafe right in the downtown core area. Ordered one latte here. The decor/ service were awesome, the only thing was no latte art in my latte"}
{"text":"I came here again and the dark roast coffee was just as good as the first one I had. The chocolate baton is outstanding by the way. Get it. The WiFi was fast and didn't drop my connection. Still, it was named 1 hour guest WiFi or something like that which I think is a bit short for me but understandable since they don't have too much seating. They would probably be better served by putting down another table rather than limiting WiFi to 1 hour. Despite this, zavida is probably my favourite coffee shop in the area."}
{"text":"A few steps from hotel Chelsea where we stayed; suggested to us by a fellow traveler. Our primary interchanges (3 mornings in a row) were with William the manager. Exceedingly pleasant with excellent customer service. Breakfast sandwich? Outstanding--light Brioche buns with sesame seeds, fried egg, white cheddar, bacon and tomato. All cooked fresh on the grill in front of you, not microwaved. Terrific coffee, delicious pastries, muffins and in house cookies. Highly recommend a visit to this local spot"}
{"text":"I was wandering around downtown this past Saturday afternoon looking for a coffee shop to read and journal in. I had originally planned on checking out Dineen or Balzac's Ryerson, but both were completely packed. Yelp directed me to Zavida, and I'm glad it did! The place is kind of hidden just off of Yonge St, so I definitely would've passed it by if it hadn't been for Yelp. It's not very big inside but luckily for me, there were a few tables available when I went.   I ordered a small matcha green tea latte ($3.65) and apple danish ($2.95). Both were pretty good, and they heated the danish up for me as well. Baristas are very friendly!  The only thing I didn't love about Zavida is that it was a little dark inside. Sure, the light fixtures and decor are cool, but it's kind of dim especially if you don't sit near the window. I really liked the vibe of the place, but wished it was just a little brighter! Other than that, this is a wonderful place to hang out or get some work done.   Random little tip - the floor tiles are pretty nifty and if you want to take a classic #ihavethisthingwithfloors photo but are too shy to stand awkwardly while you get the perfect shot for the 'gram (like me), go to the bathroom. The tiles are in there too!"}
