{"text":"This must be the most disgusting Korean rice bowl I have ever tasted. The rice is undercooked so there are little hard pieces. The beef is way over cooked so it is like cardboard.  The sauce is too salty and they put in way too much. I am thinking now should I try to finish this off or just write it off and be $11 short."}
{"text":"\"Un-Happy Bowel\"  The Korean Beef Bowl is a mucky mess of touch beef, woody greens, slimy kimchee, and a sauce that's somehow 100% sugar, 100% soy sauce, and 100% garlic (yes, that adds up to 300%... Because it's 3x as underwhelming as it could be).  Skip it!"}
{"text":"Worst food that I've ever have in my life. ordered a noddle soup, the broth taste just like Mr noddle!!! and they only put 3 slices of beef in there!!! and it's $10!! I will NEVER come back and not recommend anyone to try it!"}
{"text":"Grabbed a quick dinner here with co-workers last night. I didn't have high expectations but was pleasantly surprised. The sesame tofu bowl was really delicious. I was expecting food court quality (especially since the guy prepared it in less than 10 seconds literally) but all the ingredients tasted fresh, warm and tofu was niceful grilled. You can get it with organic quinoa instead of rice. It's a good portion size (enough for dividing into 2 meals in my opinion)."}
{"text":"It would be kinda cheesy for me to say that Happy Bowl makes me happy--but I don't care. It makes me ecstatic. The new Richtree Natural Market Restaurants at the Eaton's Centre Food court has taken me out of the dark ages and has made me look forward to lunch once again. I totally forget that I'm dining in a mall.  The Happy Bowl menu offers six choices: Lime Leaf Chicken, Korean Beef Bowl, Saigon Bowl, Curry Curry, Sesamerific, and my favourite--the Salmon Bowl. How can you go wrong with a big fillet of organic, grilled salmon on a bed of brown rice and topped with vegetables? Now that's what I call guilt-free and healthy! I cannot get enough of this bowl.  Other base options include jasmine rice, noodles or organic quinoa. Bowls range between the $7.99-$9.99, but it is quite a good portion.  It is mayhem during the lunch rush, and since they only opened not too long ago, it seems that there are still a few things that need to be ironed out. For example, they sometime run out of brown rice (the horror). Labels would also be helpful for the boxes to go, as it only creates confusion and a backlog of customers. The employees have to re-open the boxes in order to make sure it is the right order."}
{"text":"Happy bowl used to be really good when it first started... Good price, good value, perfect portion... Most importantly, they served very healthy food.  I just revisited happy bowl yesterday, the food was very oily, portion was only half of what it's used to be and very expensive.  Very very disappointed. I will never eat at happy bowl again."}
{"text":"Richtree market is known to be expensive for their foods so it was no surprise that'd I would be spending ~$10 for a meal.  However i do like how they prepare their foods because I always feel the portions are just enough without feeling lethargic, dehydrated, or super gassy/bloated afterwards,  which means they use quality ingredients (according to my tummy at least).    So far I've tried the Lime Leaf Chicken and enjoy the seasoning they use. It isn't anything special but a neutral tasting oil with a few spices thrown in. The chicken is lean but very dry to taste.  There's a fair amount of cooked veggies, with an option of rice, noodles, and quinoa, which are borderline bland but fresh.  Happy bowl is not the absolute best tasting meal but is a healthy option for eating outside. Note that there is 10% off for students."}
{"text":"Tucked away inside Eaton Center, Richtree Market offers a food court of sorts, similar to Marche.   Tried the Lime Leaf Chicken with jasmine rice at Happy Bowl with a friend. Was not impressed by the bland flavor or the unseasoned, under-cooked vegetables. The chicken breast was moist, which made the meal less disappointing.   The price is steep for a food court quality meal. I don't think I will be returning to Happy Bowl, but may try the salad bar or the bakery section.    2.5 stars."}
