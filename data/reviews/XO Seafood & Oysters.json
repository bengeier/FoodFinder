{"text":"The place was empty,  that was the first bad sign.  I do not think the chef cares about his food.  You expect a lot more for those prices."}
{"text":"We reserved a fireplace side table for our 25th wedding anniversary celebration. When making the reservation, we requested a fireplace table - a special spot recommended by a friend. Service was prompt. We asked for the wood burning fireplace to be started for atmosphere but also as it was dark and cool at our table near the very large fireplace opening. A manager returned to explain the fireplace would not be lit as they did not have enough wood to make it through the evening and when it goes out smoke enters restaurant. He said they purchase wood from a local grocery store which had run out. Strike 1. This, on the east side of Cleveland where most burn wood and it is sold on every street and corner. We were HUGELY disappointed, discussed leaving, but not having any good options decided to stay the course. We ordered a $45 bottle of Sauvingnon Blanc. It arrived promptly with an ice bucket. Good thing as it was warm! Strike 2. We added ice cubes from our water glasses and stayed the course. We reviewed the menu and the server nicely explained other options. Steaks on the menu run from $35-45. The server described a Tomahawk ribeye special not on the menu that I could not resist and so ordered it and my wife scallops. It arrives promptly, as ordered and was excellent. We were treated to a complementary anniversary dessert to share, also delicious. With the atmosphere of a cold drafty fireplace table, we decide to continue our evening elsewhere. Our bill was dropped at the table and I was surprised to see my steak alone was $92. I expected something on the high end of the menu rather than DOUBLE. My mistake to not ask for the price initially but Strike 3. Food was terrific but, overall, I felt we overpaid and XO under delivered for our experience."}
{"text":"By far the best steakhouse in Cleveland. Not only is the food amazing, the service is exceptional. The ambience is by far the best of any restaurant in the Cleveland area. A major contributing factor is the owner is personally involved. I would consider him to be one of the best operators and hosts in the business. I would highly recommend XO, whether it is a personal occasion, hosting business clients or just an evening out in the city."}
{"text":"Meeh. Have enjoyed XO in past. But last night was disappointing. Was not asked if it was a special occasion - it was.  We were seating with no drink menu and had to ask for it. When the waiter handed it to us, he asked what we wanted to order? Maybe let us open it first?  The beets on the roasted beet salad were just sliced and served cold.  No spacing between salad and entree. My tuna was delicious but was to have glazed roasted carrots. When I asked, the server said they did not have any. He offered to bring another vegetable but it was so late for his return to follow up  I didn't bother.  Finally got two scoops of ice cream for dessert and one flavor was totally melted when served.  Shabby.  My husbands steak and crab bisque were both excellent - so these comments are based on that extra we are paying for at XO. There is a lot of competition in the high end steak venues - won't be returning here anytime soon."}
{"text":"What a great addition to the east side! The atmosphere is cool. Does not feel like you are in Cleveland. The service was excellent, and the food delicious. I thought the menu had a lot of options and interesting combinations. I had a caribbean  flavored Red Snapper which was the special that night that was so flavorful without being too spicy? The drinks were yummy. I'm not sure why people are complaining about the prices, I have eaten at many steak houses on the east and west sides of Cleveland as well as downtown, and All the prices are comparable if ordering similar dishes. 
I can't wait to eat on the patio!"}
{"text":"After listening to my parents for 6 months talk about wanting to celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary at XO Pepper Pike, I made a reservation for them to enjoy a great night out.  They had good drinks and enjoyed the food, but the level of service was no different than a night out at 2 star restaurant.  I noted the anniversary in the reservation and told an employee about the anniversary on the confirmation call.  There was no mention of their special day by the hostess or server...not even a complimentary dessert or glass of champagne.  
I would expect much more attention to detail from this type of establishment.  I followed up with a note to XO with no reply to date.  Cleveland has a booming food scene and I'm sorry I didn't read reviews to choose a place where they would receive 5-star treatment."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to XO this evening for a Valentine's Day dinner. It was our first time there and we were delighted by the ambiance as we were led to our table. We were expecting a great experience, but our expectations were dashed early on. We were seated at a small round table and two or three minutes later a very young couple was seated at the table right next to us, and I do mean RIGHT next to us, no more then 24 inches from ours, so close we had to almost whisper to maintain any sense of privacy. Our server was the same one who waited on the next table and for some reason, he thought it was okay to inform both tables about the specials at the same time, because \"you all arrived at about the same time.\" We we expecting something really outstanding at this high end restaurant, but it seemed he was more interested in turning tables quickly. Both my wife and I thought that was a bit unprofessional. 

He gave both the young couple and us some time to make our selections from the VERY PRICEY menu (upper $30s to upper $40s for a steak without sides) and returned in a few minutes to take our order, or at least that's what we thought he would do. He actually said (addressing both tables), \"Okay, who wants to order first?\" Seriously?! That is not the way it's done, even at the local tavern. My wife graciously deferred to the young couple and then we ordered too. While we were waiting for our food, the couple on the other side of us (equally close to our table) got the attention of their server, and the man told their server that his steak was undercooked. The server apologized and took the man's steak back to the kitchen. 

It wasn't too long before our steaks and sides came. My wife's filet (medium doneness) was tasty, she reported, but it wasn't really hot. My medium bone-in was somewhere between warm and cool. This at a place supposedly known for steaks. Our server apologized and took it back to the kitchen, and after 3-4 minutes he brought back a hot steak. As for the vegetable sides ($8-$9), the spinach was outstanding, and the seasonal vegetables were tasty. But we didn't go to XO for the vegetables; we went for top-notch steaks and we both felt let down by this \"reputable\" steakhouse. Short of someone giving us a gift card, we don't plan to make a return trip, as there are a number of other steakhouses in the area that far surpass XO, both in service and quality of the food."}
{"text":"from friendly fill-in bartender, dave - to the giant shrimp cocktail - to the perfectly cooked strip steak (charred on the outside/rare on the inside) - to the saut√©ed onions & mushrooms - to the brussel sprouts - to the incredible potato pancakes - xo was an absolute home run again

always is"}
{"text":"BEST STEAK in my LIFE! My wife and I came to xo for our date night and while it was on the pricy side it was well worth it. The juiciest most tender steak I have ever had melted in my mouth! The asparagus was amazing. Everything was well seasoned. My service was exceptional. Will def be back!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere! I went with my husband on opening night- we both got the Crab Bisque as appetizer. My husband had the Bone-in Ribeye with garlic/ herb butter and said it was perfect.  I had the Linguine Del Mare and the sauce had a bit of a kick to it but quite a nice amount of shellfish meat on the dish.  We love the Bananas Foster Cheesecake they have at the downtown location but they didn't have that as a dessert choice here- we were a bit disappointed as that is what we are accustomed to ending our XO meal with each time we visit the downtown location.  I know they are trying to keep some differences between the two but that dessert is not something the east siders should be denied."}
{"text":"Dinner last night was extremely loud. Could not hear the conversation at our own table.
The food was not any better. Asked if they could chop my wedge salad and the answer was no. Strip steak was just ok. Salmon tasted like onions even after asking for no onions. The sea bass was good and the fish special was below average. however the jojo fries were delicious"}
{"text":"I would have given them 5 stars if were not for the over priced menu.  This is compared to the competition with Mortons, Flemings, and others to choose from.  For the 2 of us our check was $271 which included an app, mid priced wine and 1 dessert to split....kind of high but we said \"1st world problems we have\". 
Really enjoyed our experience, service and food was wonderful.  $150-$200 for a meal is reasonable and that can be found anywhere else in NE Ohio, not $271......."}
{"text":"This was our first time at XO.  We had a reservation and got there a little early to hopefully enjoy a drink at the bar.  We sat in the bar area and were told someone would be over.  That never happened!  My husband went up to the bar and tried to order a drink and was pretty much ignored.  We did almost walk out.  Finally we got a seat at the bar and were still ignored for a few and then finally did get a drink.  We were not seated until 45 minutes after our reservation time.  Our waiter was very good and could tell this was not a good experience so far.  We ordered apps and a salad and that came out on time.  Our entree's took a very long time! Our waiter did apologize.  I can tell you after the price and experience we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Great Chilean Sea Bass! I would recommend this restaurant to anyone! Great for large parties and group events."}
{"text":"Interesting to see the range of reviews here. My wife and I went on Christmas Eve for a special date and it was probably the best dining experience we've had in Cleveland in the last 7-8 years. The steaks were cooked to perfection - I had the bone in ribeye and it was very tender and flavorful. The sides were outstanding - the Brussels sprouts with bacon bits were phenomenal and complimented our meal so well. Potatoes au gratin were also good. And we had a special burrata salad recommended to us by our server which was to die for! 

Finally, the wine was just truly amazing. Our server, Mark, was right on the mark throughout the whole meal as he recommended wines for each of us and our appetizers and meals (he recommended a particular Sauvignon blanc for half shell oysters that totally blew my mind). The atmosphere, the food, and service - hands down one of the best in Cleveland.  We used to go to Fleming. No more!"}
{"text":"I agree with some of the other reviewers, if the prices were lower, this might be 4 stars.  I dined at the new XO on a Saturday night, met a girlfriend there for dinner.   We started our meal with cocktails.  My Lipstick cocktail was just ok, nothing to write home about.  We were presented with 2 varieties of warm sliced bread and butter which was delicious.  I ordered the shaved heirloom vegetable salad which was very good, ingredients were fresh and salad was dressed appropriately.  We each ordered the petit surf & turf entree which consisted of a petit filet mignon and (1) shrimp scampi, a side of augratin potatoes and we both requested that they hold the spinach.  I ordered an a la carte side of brussels sprouts instead.  The entree's arrived in a timely manner with 2 small issues, my girlfriend's (1) shrimp scampi was the size of a small lobster tail and mine was the size of a large (not jumbo) shrimp.  The server rectified by bringing me an additional one (thx:-).  We also ordered are beef medium well, but received medium rare (didn't send it back).  The meat was tender, the scampi was grilled and seasoned well and the potatoes and brussel sprouts were good too.   We each opted for ice cream/sorbet (Mitchells) for dessert.   The bright spot of the entire evening was our server Jake, very attentive without being overbearing.   We enjoyed our meal, but once again, not sure that it was worth the price."}
{"text":"We had many choices for NYE reserved, but chose XO, as neither of us have ever been and wanted to try. We may have had high expectations for a $50 steak, but when mine was cooked perfectly, but cold, as were the sides, and my husband's was way overdone, we were disappointed. We really didn't have a chance to tell our server as she didn't come back to our table to check in, so we ate as we waited for the wine we hoped to enjoy with our steak. She was very sweet and offered us wine, coffee, or dessert on the house, but we did not want that. She told us she asked the manager, Zeke, who was \"scary\" (her words) to come to our table, but he did not. We paid our bill and left. On our way out, I told my husband, to go back in and just tell them about his steak, as we paid, did not want anything, but wanted them to know we were unhappy. Zeke, who said he was not a manager, but the owner, told him he was busy and chose not to stop by our table. It wasn't that busy; Applebee's is busier on a Tuesday night and the manager still stops by the table when everything is fine. SO disappointing."}
{"text":"As far as steaks go, this is up there with Urban Farmer. It's got the hallmarks of how I'd love my steak done: a crusted, charred surface, and a juicy, smokey center. Temperature was right on the money, with meat tender enough to cut with a butter knife.

Appetizers were great: oysters Rockefeller, lobster and corn fritters (although this was a bit on the starchy side), sides were excellent. 

The ambience was elegant, great for special occasions or simply to satisfy the carnivore in you. GROWL!!! ROAR!!! (that was my tummy)"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Yes the prices are high but you get what you pay for.  The service is always great in my opinion. And the valets are always prompt. 

Their specialty butters are always exciting to try. 

Salad:
The wedge salad is simply amazing. The candied pecans and bacon are really tasty.

Steaks:
The first time I ordered the 18oz ribeye (med) and my boyfriend ordered the bone in filet (med/well). Although my favorite cut is the ribeye his bone in filet was absolutely amazing so now we both order the 12oz bone in filet when we dine. They always cook them perfectly so I have no complaints.

Side:
Brussels and Bacon were great. I offer mine cooked a bit more but they were still great. 

Scalloped Potatoes are so good. I can't eat here without ordering them. Idk if it's the cheeses they use or what but they are just perfect. 

Dessert:
I love their seasonal cheesecakes. I've tried Raspberry Mango and Bananas Foster."}
{"text":"After a mediocre, overpriced dinner a few months ago, I had lunch at XO and had a terrific experience.  The food was delicious and while many of the menu items were extremely pricy, I chose a delicious flank steak salad.  It was prepared exactly as I had modified the order.   Our server, Charles, was outstanding and added to the enjoyment of my meal."}
{"text":"Took my son for his birthday. Excellent food , excellent service   The roasted  garlic was also delicious.  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"This is the best location serving the highest quality of Prime USA Cuts of Meat, locally sourcing the majority of their produce and cuts.  The serve is great, the servers are knowledgeable and effective doing their jobs making the dining expirence enjoyable and easy.  My only issue with XO Prime Steakhouse is the fact sides aren't included as a portion of your entr√©e price, which is already above market value but everything included it is a worthwhile dining experience. I love their bone in ribeye and their tuna is extremely fresh even though XO in Ohio."}
{"text":"First off, the place inside is nice it just lacks customers, the place was very empty so I was kind of worried. I will just start off talking about the prices of the food, I just expect more food for the price. I ordered the petite surf and turf, and it was literally for a baby lol, with a high end price tag. The only thing I truly loved was the bacon butter that went on the steak. Everything else needed more flavor and seasoning. I think there are other places out there better for less."}
{"text":"Dinner was good, but not excellent.  For the prices charged, it should be excellent.  My \"prime\" steak didn't seem prime to me.  It was not as good as Fleming's or ML and not in the same league as Red.  Neither the manager or anyone else came to the table to see how things were.  With the food and restaurant disinterest, I will not be returning anytime soon.  I had been to the original location a few years ago and thought it was far better.  Oh well, there are many better restaurants in the area which will receive my business."}
{"text":"We live down the street and we've never stopped in, but we've always wondered about XO. Finally, last night we made a last-minute reservation. It was spectacular. The space is exquisite. We were stunned to discover this fabulous dining space was hiding in that boring office building. It was wonderful.

Our server was incredible - Jeff, I believe. The food was delicious. I'm 6.5 months pregnant and our server helped me navigate the menu to maximize my experience while still abiding by the rather stringent pregnancy food rules. I removed the tuna from the tempura roll and loved it. I ordered the scallops for my entree and Jeff even made sure they cooked my scallops a bit more than usual due to my pregnancy. The entree was lovely. The risotto was a perfect complement to the scallops. My husband had a blackened steak (I forget exactly what he ordered) with prawns and creamy spinach. He loved everything.

We were disappointed to skip dessert, but we had other plans. Yet again, our server was phenomenal in getting us our check quickly to ensure we were on time to our next plans.

This was such delightful experience. We look forward to returning very soon and we'll be recommending it to all our friends. I just feel foolish that we waited to long to try it."}
{"text":"Went here with a group from work, had the filet and garlic mashed potatoes, both were excellent, great flavor. Everyone else enjoyed their meals, and our server was on point. No complaints since my manager covered the tab, but the prices are definitely on the high side and I'd have a more difficult time justifying the cost if it was coming out of my wallet...price was the only reason I couldn't go with a full five stars."}
{"text":"We had not been here before and now think that XO might be our first choice of restaurant for the 5-6 times a year when we visit Cleveland (family visits). The food and service was outstanding, the menu offered a good selection of choices, and the venue quiet enough for us to converse comfortably with each other. But again, the food is what we really found would bring us back again and again."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and closed on a house so i wanted to treat her to a nice late lunch/ Dinner. Since it was only 4pm it was very empty. 1st let my start by saying the men's bathroom had a oder of a truck stop McDonald's. Smelled like old urine inside of a gym sock. For my appetizer we got the blue cheese lobster  beignets. They were very creamy, crispy and tasty. For my main course I got the Halibut with purple potato hash & creamed cauliflower With scallop potatoes on the side.The creamed cauliflower was the star of the plate. The Halibut was dry but flavorful enough for me to enjoy it. My girlfriend got a big ass steak and a baked potato. For the price it was not worth it. If this wasn't a special day I would not have came."}
{"text":"I've been to both the downtown location as well as this one. Both times the service and food were fantastic. 
At this location I have the linguine in a spicy red sauce, which was amazing. Several large scallops (though one was a bit meaty and tough), lobster pieces, and the largest shrimp I have ever seen. The sauce was spicy but not too much so. 
I also had a Caesar salad, which was perfect."}
{"text":"The restaurant is nice looking inside, however is way over-priced for the quality of the food. My strip steak was full of fat & veins, and way over cooked. The Caesar salad had bad/soggy lettuce, and the service was bad. 
The side dishes were good, the sweet potato fries & mashed potatoes were yummy. 
definitely would not recommend this, very over priced & you will not be satisfied"}
{"text":"I came back home and saw OX on the side of Chagrin. I had to go, and I'm happy I went. It was classy, sexy, and a lot of beautiful people in there. I was blown away by my steak (bone in filet) so much favor and cooked perfectly. My Father dish was seafood linguini with lobster, crab, muscles, scallops in a red spicy sauce. Let me tell you I'm happy he couldn't eat it all.....cuz I did!!! Lobster and crab was mouth watering, and the scallop melted in my mouth. Just writing this review I want to go back and I just ate there a few hours ago. Well done XO and great name, I love it. Cognac \"XO\" means perfection and the owner initials. Classy, romantic, upscale place. 1st Class... Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We usually love XO but New Years Eve is definitely a hard night to go. We decided to eat at the bar, which we normally do. Not a great choice tonight. Bartenders were nice, but not very attentive to diner service. Drinks were great, but sides were wrong, no bread even when they told you it was coming. $50 crab legs were fishy tasting. Steak was good, but no sear. 

Red is still my favorite."}
