{"text":"I don't normally write a review after the first visit but I am making the exception for this outfit. I ordered a classic with bacon, a pickle, coleslaw and a bottle of Lac St Jean's. \"Red Champagne\" to go. The sandwich had eighty grams of gooey life-affirming Quebec cheese and three slices of yummy smoky bacon that came together in a symphony of nostalgia and mommy hugs. The coleslaw, a beautiful blend of cabbage, celery, fennel and homemade mayonnaise provided crunch in perfect counterpoint to the swoony sammy. The dill pickle, plump and juicy cleansed the palate in preparation for my second bite off the grilled cheese.  The Red Champagne topped it all off perfectly, adding an exotic flavour reminiscent of cherry coke and brio.   You owe it to yourself to get down there and try out ANY of the fourteen sammies that these food-geniuses have to offer. Just saying."}
{"text":"This place has no business hours. They just open when they have food, which isn't often.  For a month, I went to this place at various times and they were closed for no reason. But I finally got to try them. My review is a bit tainted because I was really frustrated that they were closed all the time.  The grilled cheese was good. I ordered the classic bacon because they were out of ingredients to make the mac and cheese (I'll go back and try it though).  The ingredients did feel fresh and I really appreciated the bechamel sauce and the cheese on the outside and inside of the sandwich. I think it's great that all the ingredients are from Quebec, but it that does mean it's a bit pricey for a grilled cheese (9$ without tax, students do get 20% off though).  He toasted it a bit too long and so the bread wasn't perfect. The bacon got lost in the rest of the sandwich."}
{"text":"Excellent grilled cheese, les meilleurs que j'ai mangé. Ambiance et décore tendance et épurés. Staffs attentionnés et professionnels. Ça vaut le détour."}
