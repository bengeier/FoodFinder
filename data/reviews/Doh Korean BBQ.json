{"text":"Great korean BBQ. I've been here twice and the service is always fast. Servers are all nice, modern feel vibe-place. Food is awesome too. They have a good ventilator so you wont have that bbq sticky smell on your clothes."}
{"text":"My first time here was a great experience, probably cause we were the only customers in here but Ryan was a really good server. The food taste good as well! It's kinda far from me but I'd def come here again cause I don't have to wait hours for kbbq!"}
{"text":"Love how friendly the staff are. Great to finally find a good Korean restaurant near our place."}
{"text":"Tried out this korean bbq since it Is very close to my house, our go to korean bbq is tofu hut but were always on a hunt for something that is closer.  This place did not dissapoint, their salad tasted very close to tofu hut's  as well as their fish cake, the macaroni one was good safe to say we enjoyed the side dishes.  We got brisket, beef tongue, marinated ribeye and the squid.  Everything was very good but the one that stood out for me was the squid,  it's got this spicy coating that I really liked and the way its cut made it so much easier to cook it (unlike the one from tofu which I never order)..  The grill could be better though, because the meat sticks to the grill, however their very good customer service saved them from me deducting a star because our grill was changed twice without us having to ask :) only sugguestion is please add TRIPE honey comb like the one from tofu hut..   Overall I would definitely return.  Good food, Good location, outstanding customer service!! The amazing squid made up for the absence of tripe on the menu.. :)"}
{"text":"The interior is clean and nicely decorated. No wait time at all since it recently just opened. The place could include a bit more variety with their tapas. The beef brisket and pork shoulder were great! Shoutout to our server Adrian who gave such awesome service. He constantly checked on us and made sure we were properly cared for."}
{"text":"I went here with coworkers and my friend is Korean. The service was amazing! All the meats we tried were good quality. Loved the onions... salad!!! Then then tea. The atmosphere is welcoming. We will be back"}
{"text":"First time here and we love it.  Quantity of food is excellent. 5/5 Quality of food overall 4/5... -Marinated sweet and mild chicken lacked flavor 3/5 -Beef tongue was juicy, big portion (even after cooked) but was a little chewy. 3/5 -Beef Bulgogi very tender, juicy and no fat. 5/5  Favorite side dishes: -Kimchi.. Nice crunch to them, very juicy, fresh and beautiful color. 5/5 -Fish Cakes... Delicious, great texture, not too fishy. 5/5 -Mac Salad... Perfect. Pasta nicely cooked, not over powered by mayo and not too tangy. Very light. 5/5   Customer service!!! The best in Las Vegas!!! They are so warm, friendly, helpful and inviting. Very attentive!! Very professional, yet we didn't feel intimidated by them at all. 5/5  Price: 19.95 for AYCE Dinner 1. Cant beat it. 5/5  We WILL be back. Yum!"}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly, attentive, and are always willing to change out your grill for a new one. You can't beat the price for a Korean BBQ place that provides good quality meat, side dishes, and a clean environment."}
{"text":"Super cute place. My family and I eat Korean often and thought we'd give this place a try. One of our top favorites now!  Service is great!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I wanted to try this place out because of tofu hut, but this place is way closer to where I live. We have been going to hwaro, but hwaro  is just  as far as tofu hut. Nice urban interior, very clean, but there are a limited number of tables, so it's better to go earlier, especially on the weekends. There are three choices of AYCE, would definitely go with dinner I, because it includes everything except the prime ribeye I think. The meat quality is better than tofu hut in my opinion. The grill was changed multiple times, and you're provided some fat to grease the grill.  The only complaint i have is that when  the fan/vent is pulled down,  it sits right smack dab in the line of sight with whoever is across from you.  So you sit either to the left or right of it if you want to see each other.   Overall, I think it's worth a try, for quality kbbq that is on the west side of town.  It's also close to brew tea bar and serenade, so if you want dessert, it's just down the street."}
{"text":"The worst kbbq I have ever had in my life!! Horrible quality for 23! The beef part is really disappointed! Dun even wanna try the pork after having the beef part and squid. The only thing taste good is the steam eggs SAD"}
{"text":"Tasty, affordable, and attentive. Doh kbbq is a must try place for kbbq lovers in Clark County."}
{"text":"The food was great but unfortunately the service was not. Most of our group was new to the Korean BBQ concept and our server failed to explain how it worked even when asked. Then our drink orders took 15+ minutes to fill on multiple occasions, and we had to flag down our sever to reminder them to bring us refills and when we wanted to order more items, again on multiple occasions. When we asked our server about ingredients in the dishes for dietary needs, it was a I don't really know response instead offering to check with the chef. I don't like writing bad reviews and I hope it was a one off for this restaurant, but it was really disappointing to not receive better service and it put a damper on the rest of our night. Then on top of all of this we were automatically charged 18% gratuity for having a party of 4. I don't intend to return to this restaurant after this experience."}
{"text":"I am so glad there's finally a Korean bbq spot near my side of town. I'm not sure why people are giving this place low ratings. The price was perfect $19.95 for AYCE is pretty dope! Friendly staff and clean restaurant. The quality of the food was really good. Our server Adrian was hella cool and professional. He was always courteous and tentative. I'd definitely go back here! My wife and I loved this place. If you decide to go check out my homie Adrian. Hella cool dude!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is clean.  Food is good.  Service is fair."}
{"text":"Our favorite kbbq joint here in town. Almost rivals the best ayce restaurants back home in L.A. Although they get quite busy, the staff is always attentive and serves you with a smile."}
{"text":"Here is good food and service. I love this place. Beef brisket is the best. Also short ribs is very delicious. I love those meat."}
{"text":"i came here the other day. we had Ryan as our server and he was excellent!! great customer service and he always check up on us. food was great, it's worth the $19.95 dinner price. definitely my go-to kbbq ayce place!!!!!"}
{"text":"1. POOR Services!! Server thought we don't understand Korean, so they standing behind us and talk about our eating, but they were wrong!! One of us was able to listen n talk in Korean!!!  2. BBQ pan made all meat taste as dry as paper... 3. Ventilation tube blocked eye contact between us!!! 4. Four people ordered shrimp n served only three...how we gonna share those....no common sense of serving at all... 5. Only 3 kinds of Side dishes and two of them are kimchi...(cabbage and radish) 6. They give free steam egg but charge for soup! So be caution when you order: 19.99 does not include soup( most of AYCE Korean BBQ places include soups) **Won't go there again, I would rather drive to spring mountain or Henderson for better Korean BBQ."}
{"text":"Food are just the same like All you can eat Korean BBQ, the  service are good,  but  the seating arrangements is not a good idea."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots for Korean BBQ AYCE. Love the ribye and pork. Place has a cool atmosphere about it. Minus one star because service can be pretty slow sometimes. Great food though!"}
{"text":"Was excited that a KBBQ place opened up in the Southwest area, and better yet, no long wait lines compared to other places (like Gen).  After two visits there, my guess is the long wait line won't ever be an issue.  We went for lunch during the first visit and found the non-BBQ lunch menu to be quite limited.  Basically stews and soups, and surprisingly, no soon dubu (go figure).  The few ban chan side dishes, usually one of my favorite parts about eating Korean food, was disappointing.  At least one of them was kimchi, I suppose.  Decided to try the place again for dinner and the AYCE BBQ.  Long story short, the meat and salad were good; plus there's the usual selection one would want: brisket, bugolgi, galbi (not bone in), beef tongue, and pork belly.  There's an option to pay extra for Dinner Menu 2, which I guess includes one rib eye steak or something for each person.  Everything else was underwhelming.  AYCE KBBQ dinner did include steamed egg, but not soybean soup/stew (what the heck); side dishes, again, were limited, not to mention the absence of rice paper, radish paper, or hot sauce.    All that aside, what sealed this place's fate for me and the one reason why I'd think twice about coming back--automatic 18% gratuity for our party of 4.  That's a pretty aggressive in my opinion.  Though clearly stated on the menu that gratuity will be added for parties of 6 or more, apparently they recently decided to change it to 4 (note the place just opened a month ago).  Somehow that just irks me.  Next."}
{"text":"The restaurant was super crowded and busy. We had to wait for an hour to get a table. They should consider expanding. Once we got the table, the server was rather in a bad mood. He was rushing our order and when we received our rice, it was cold and hard. After we got order, we had to wait another 25 minutes to get more meat. I would give it a one star but their meat is good. So three stars for this restaurant."}
{"text":"Nice, clean, pleasant atmosphere.  Greeted by staff as we walked in the door, seated and water and beverage service was immediate.  Since this was our first time here we got the AYCE Dinner II.  A bottle of black raspberry wine and the sides started coming.  Excellent and plentiful.  First out and on the grill was rib eye steak.  Our server Na Eun was very helpful  cutting up the steaks as they cooked.  They were juicy, well spiced, and flowed well with the rice and house salad, as well as the other condiments and sides.  While we were eating a bowl of beef bulgogi  was placed on the table, and are we to be very busy eating our hostess got the beef grilling for us.  When we asked she gave pointers keeping us supplied with meats and seafoods as she went with extreme graciousness.  Even as it got busier and she was handling far more than the two of us we did not lack for care and courtesy.  The food was marvelous, the staff even better.  We were hungry when we arrived and the only picture we took shows what we felt.  WE WILL BE GOING BACK!"}
{"text":"Oh my god! My husband had food poisoning right after having the korean bbq at this place! Wont recommend this new opening place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Really yummy food! Good service. I always end up burning the grill though lol idk how to work it."}
{"text":"Staff is extremely friendly & attentive. Food was great!!  New favorite spot for Korean BBQ in the SW."}
{"text":"Great value, great food! Came here for lunch with a party of 8. We had the lunch all you can eat which included all the side dishes, salad, and meats. Meats were tender and juicy. The servers were very attentive. Water and sauces for dipping were always topped up right before we needed to ask them too."}
{"text":"Came here at 1050 pm and they literally locked the door as we were approaching. One of the servers ran to the door to lock it, then shut off their open sign. Last call on the door says 12am and so does yelp. You guys need to fix this."}
{"text":"Ambiance was great! Service was impeccable and the food was delicious!! I absolutely loved the salad that they provided on the all you can eat menu! The side dishes were really great too! If you don't mind cooking your own meal and enjoying fun and laughter with friends this is a great place to do it. The only thing I did not like was the tight quarters in the booth area! If you are a big guy or even a tall guy it would be hard to fit in through the sides. I hope they open it up a little more so it is easier to get in and out of the booth. That is why instead of a 5 star review they got a 4 star! Change that and my review would be updated!!"}
{"text":"Nice clean place a little on the small size so we had a small wait but the food made up for it tasted as good as any Korean I've been to and the price was very fair definetly will return here"}
{"text":"Amazing experience! Was in town and looking for a great AYCE KBBQ place not too far from the strip. Happen to scroll through Yelp and found this awesome place! Great decor and interior with booth seating.  Their brisket was fantastic with lots of marble, shrimp was fresh, and their pork belly was off the hook!  The staff is phenomenal! Very courteous and professional.  I have many experiences at other BBQ places where the service was rude and disrespectful. Not this place..... So if you all are in town, check out Doh Korean! You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"I went here a few weeks ago with a group of my friends. Splendid service from the servers, very friendly and casual. The interior was also nice and the food was good compared to some other places that I went in the past. The side dishes that they has was also delicious and seasoned well~~ ^^"}
{"text":"It is understandable for the restaurant to have last call and I absolutely have no problem with that.   Just kinda hard to understand when the restaurant close at 12am, last call is at 11pm and does not want to take in customers at 10:30pm.   Hhuhmmm i would change the last call to 10:30pm, not 11pm"}
{"text":"Descent Korean bbq and the staff are friendly. It would be nice if they had more variety of meats but other then that it's pretty good overall!"}
{"text":"Overall the quality of the food is good. The selection of meets seemed a little limited for the price in comparison to other similarly priced places such as Hwaro. The only problem I had is that they automatically added a 18% gratuity because they said they do that for parties of 4 or more. I think that's a little excessive for serving a family of 2 adults and 2 kids. You're looking at a $17 tip (for 4 people) for them to bring you out food that you're going to cook yourself. It's closer to the southwest side of town so if you live on that side and don't feel like driving far then it's an ok choice, but if you want more variety and not pay an excessive tip. Make the drive to Chinatown and go to Hwaro you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"First visit in for me & the fam tonight and we absolutely loved it.  We opted for the AYCE Dinner I which is $4 less than Dinner II but does not include Beef Ribeye.  We ordered:  Beef Brisket, Boneless Galbi, Beef Tongue & Chicken Bulgogi.  My fav was the Boneless Galbi, nice & tender w/ great flavor.  Beef Brisket was a close second, its super yummy if you dip it in the sesame oil w/ salt & pepper and wrap it around some of their delicious Korean style salad.  The portion sizes are good, not too big but enough to keep you happy.  You can even order half sizes of the meat dishes to allow you to try a number of selections w/out busting your gut.  They had a nice variety of banchan & their kimchee was tasty and we all know, if the kimchee is good at a Korean restaurant then the food is gonna be bomb!  All the way around Doh killed it tonight, food was delish, service was phenomenal, awesome location & the prices were incredible.  AYCE Dinner I was only $19.99 & kids 3 & younger are free!"}
{"text":"I tried this place out on a recommendation by a colleague of mine. She really liked this place for the price and for the flavor. Upon entering I liked the warehouse typrle, modern décor, but that's all that this place has going for them.    We entered to into a half filled restaurant with lots of open seating. Without a smile we were directed to one of the tables to which the grill was slammed in its place making a loud banging noise. The lady who came to take our order was rude and seemed irritated.   We waited a really long time for our order to arrive, so much so that we noticed a group that came after us were sat, served their meal and left before we even finished our last course.   In addition to that, every time we needed something we had to flag the waitress down. And yet she continuously was at tending to the table behind us.   Aside from the relatively low cost and the all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ, I would not recommend this place to anyone else. In a restaurant where you are doing all of your own cooking and all they need to do is prep the food and serve it to you I feel that service is more important than anything else."}
{"text":"We had a gift certificate from the business I worked for and let me tell you, it's not fun having the owner practically yell at you for coming in on a weekend and it's not great having to show the staff how to redeem the gift certificate just so I could use it. The food was good; however, the portions are kind of large so order very sparingly or they really will charge you for the leftovers. The food was good and the service was friendly but the issues with payment (the whole fiasco took almost an hour) was ridiculous."}
{"text":"Tried this place due to good reviews but family was unimpressed with the food.  First off, service is good, but the marinated meats lack flavors therefore nothing in the mouth to appreciate!  Make sure get the beef and double up instead of thin slices of  pork coz otherwise they'll bring you large portion of pork slices and you end up consuming less beef!  Korean places such as this serve small portions of salads or kimchis but you're really in there for excellent  marinated meats or seafood and for that Doh is underwhelming! Oh they added gratuity of 18% for my party of 4 so don't be surprised !"}
{"text":"Second time to Doh and it won't be the last.   Not only are they conveniently located near my neck-of-the-woods (SW), it is next to two popular dessert spots - Gelatology and Serenade! We don't have to travel all the way to Spring Mountain for AYCE Korean BBQ (yay).   Customer service was great. They were attentive to our needs and were really quick in setting us up and got us whatever else we needed without having to give the \"waiting look.\" I was impressed how efficient they were especially on a busy holiday.   There are two options: Dinner I or Dinner II. The difference? Dinner II offers Prime Rib Eye for $4 more ($23.95) than Dinner I ($19.99). In my opinion, go with Dinner I. You get all the same stuff anyways. Unless you absolutely love Prime Rib then go for it. My favorite is the brisket, bulgogi, and short ribs dipped with three options of flavorful sauces. For you guys that enjoys the steamed egg like I do, I'm happy to report that they are unlimited; not like other KBBQ places I've been to where they only offer 1 per family.   Tip *** They allowed our party of 3 to have one of us pick Dinner II so that we can try the prime rib, without having to charge the rest of us that price. That was nice of them."}
{"text":"This place was nice inside, fairly clean and the staff was kind. However, the food was less than desirable. Every piece/cut of beef we ordered seemed like it was chuck or ground beef. It was so weird. We go out for Korean BBQ every so often and it's always good. The flavoring just wasn't there and the texture of the meat was off. The bulgolgi wasn't sweet enough nor the right consistency.  Had they had the flavor and texture correct as Korean BBQ, I'd not only return but I'd gladly pay whatever the cost. Sadly, after our experience, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"I had a food poisoning last night after eating dinner at Doh BBQ. I will never go back here!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. One of the cleanest KBBQ I've  ever been here in Vegas. They are very friendly and attend to your needs right away."}
{"text":"Had dinner here for the first time & it was packed. Small little place, very clean looking. It has a couple booths & about a dozen 2 & 4 top tables. Each table comes w/ a grill. If you're not up for cooking your own food this isn't gonna be the spot for you. It's an interesting concept to go to a restaurant & you cook your main course yourself.  We ordered the all you can eat Dinner 2. Dinner 2 is different from your regular dinner as it comes w/ ribeye. We were served a dipping sauce that I used for all my meats. The sides that were brought to the table was macaroni & one other item I can't remember. There sides I'm told vary day to day. We ordered the ribeye, pork belly, pork shoulder, short ribs & another meat. The server brought out our meat to lay on the grill. We got caught up in our table conversation that our meat was getting over cooked to our liking. Not sure if the server saw this & it's apart of their service or was trying to help the meat not get burned, but he cut up our meat & served us. We didn't see anyone getting this service. It's great if this is the service, but I think they'd have to know how we want our meat cooked. I think that was my big hang up is if I'm out eating & into the conversation there's a chance I may forget to check the meat even if it's right next to me cooking away. So for the remainder of our meal he would set the meat then cut it up & move it around.   I haven't had Korean BBQ in quite awhile so I was trying to remember flavors. Flavors didn't jump out at me. The sauces we were provided helped add flavor to the meat, but it was due to the flavor stemming from the sauces only.   The service was great & everyone was all smiles. Side note this place is a sister location of Tofu Hut. If you've eaten there then this place is for you!"}
{"text":"After trying other KBBQ places in town and coming to Doh a few more times, it has become my favorite spot in town! They serve good quality meat in a clean restaurant, where their staff if very accommodating and friendly; they are always checking up on their customers to make sure they are satisfied.   The meats I usually order are the brisket, bulgogi, and pork belly. The bulgogi is flavored well, but the stars are the pork belly and brisket. They are lightly seasoned just enough to enhance the natural flavors the meats already have. The restaurant provides three different sauces; a house made brisket sauce (my personal fav for all my meats), a soy paste, and a salt, pepper, and oil combination. The meat by itself is already spectacular, but the sauces make it that much better. In addition, they have a spectacular seasoned egg. It is light and fluffy and is a great side dish as you eat all the meat.   If you haven't tried Doh, do yourself a favor and try it out. You definitely won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I love this place for the food, the service, and the close proximity to my house. All you can eat is my absolute weakness and of the places I've gone to this one is by far my favorite because not only is the food good but the service is even greater!   When you're sat they get you immediately set up with sides and barley tea (you can ask for plain water instead, but I prefer the tea). Usual sides are kimchi, fish cake, jap chae, mac/ potato salad & and pickled vegetables. You also get a trio of dipping sauces consisting of a spicy bean paste, oil w/ salt & pepper, and brisket sauce.   My favorite meats to order are pork belly, brisket and beef tongue. On a recent visit my friends introduced me to red wine pork belly, and it is safe to say it's a permanent addition to the rotation. I tend to stay away from bulgogi completely or only order when I'm with a big group that's sharing. Personally it's too heavy and I feel like I can't eat as much but it's nicely marinated. As for my favorite cuts, the brisket and the tongue are sliced super thin which means it's perfectly cooked within 30 seconds after hitting the grill. The pork belly is like a thick slice of bacon and I like to treat it as such on the grill and make it extra crispy! They also have squid and chicken, but I tend to overcook those so again, I only order them when there's a group (and someone else can be responsible for it).   Aside from the meats definitely ask for their salad, steamed egg and rice. If I'm suggesting salad that says something because I tend to distance myself from all things leafy or green. The steamed egg is so good! At some places they limit you to just one per person or one per table, but here it's part of the all you can eat which is awesome. Oh and don't forget to get a mochi ice cream for dessert!  As for service, I never feel neglected nor do they hover! My two gripes when doing all you can eat is when you're limited to a certain time and it's wasted on waiting to order or when you're always mid-mouthful when they ask how it's going. The servers here have genuine care and attentiveness. They help you cook if you need it, you never have to wait too long to get in another order, consistently replenish your tea/water, and they've never made me feel rushed once we've hit our \"time limit\". All the servers help each other out and have all been super helpful and pleasant from my experiences.   Long story short I recommend this place to anyone that loves to eat all they can. Bonus they have a really cool feature wall that plays k-pop music videos! Good food and great vibes for around 20-25 a person is totally worth it."}
{"text":"When it first opened, we were curious cos we LOVE tofu hut and doh and tofu hut has the same owner. It is a little bit pricey than tofu hut but i like it. I would definitely come back to this place. Their meats are good and the people here are very courteous. And the place is clean and nice."}
{"text":"Went here 2 times, first time was when my family & I first moved out here. 2nd time was when family came down from Arizona. Both times were great, service was excellent, a little bit of a language barrier but it's understandable. My brothers got bulgogi, short rib, brisket, and red wine pork belly, all were great along with the sauces that they provided. My favorite was the spicy squid, I ordered about 4 of them just for myself. Lol. All in all I would give it 5 stars. Service was excellent, food was excellent, ambiance was nice and relaxing!"}
{"text":"***Yelp Challenge 2016 3/100***  After my sons wrestling match, we decided to eat here. I thought with it being part of Doh Sushi, the quality of their food will be equivalent or surpass the other spots. It was EH OK. The tongue was very chewy. The pork belly and bulgogi were not OK.  The pros is that it is near my house. It was all you can eat and it was not packed. Service was also on point. Kudos to great customer service!"}
{"text":"A PERFECT hidden gem away from China town & away from the crowds. Everything is new & clean. Cute lil date spot. Every table has personal vents that come down so it doesn't smoke up or smell. Food is to die for! Best customer service ever! Growing up in CA, this is now my new favorite go to place!!!"}
{"text":"Doh is a dope little Korean BBQ spot located near Smith's on South Rainbow. For those who are unfamiliar, many KBBQ restaurants serve you the meat raw and you cook it yourself right there on your table. It's cool because you can cook it the way you want it, just don't forget to take it out when it's done. Fun experience whether it's your first or millionth time going!   The food was delicious and they have AYCE (all you can eat) so definitely come here hungry! They offer many meat choices to include bulgogi, spicy pork, chicken, shrimp and beef tongue. There is also rib eye available but it'll cost you extra. You can order unlimited rice, salad and sides with AYCE so take advantage. The sauces they serve are bomb as well, makes the meat taste so much better although it's already bomb as is.   Service was alright, not bad but a bit slow because of how packed it always is whenever I eat here. The waitresses made sure we always had water though but it took a minute to change the grill for the meat. They also said they only had big bottles of soju available but when they brought it out, it was smaller than expected (maybe 16 ounces). Still tasted amazing though so couldn't be mad!  Love coming to this spot when craving Korean food! They have the good stuff and it's never a long wait unlike the other KBBQ spots in Chinatown."}
{"text":"Don't say that you're open til 12 and stop taking new guests at 11. Need to update your time to stop seating new guests at 10:55 if thats when you're going to turn us away!!"}
{"text":"We usually go here all the time and today was the first time we were automatically charged a 18% tip without anyone even saying anything to us. Luckily I looked at the check again. After I asked why we were automatically charged tip the response I got was because of the party 4 or more wth ??!!! I had 2 adults and 1 kid 8 yrs and another kid 3 yrs ummm wth. I am upset and can't believe this !!! If they only knew they would have got more tip because we always tip 20% oooohhh well !!!! Just can't believe no one said anything to us would have tipped double !!!!"}
{"text":"Our favorite place too eat just got closer  I have already came here 4 times since They opened. That's really bad"}
{"text":"This is the worst Korean bbq place I've ever been! It is not owned by Korean people and it's not authentic at all! Do not waste your time and money here! We had to cook everything ourselves. The meat is always stuck to the grill, and the waitresses don't even realize that they need to change a completely burnt and dark grill and we had to ask, every single time! They were not even busy! They just walk by and then walk away. I'm like hello!!!? And we just could not understand what one of the waitresses was saying."}
{"text":"I am so happy this opened up right down the road from me! I lived in Korea for a year and the food here met all of my expectations. Absolutely delicious! Hopefully they put some desserts on the menu."}
{"text":"A few months ago, a coworker at one of the hospitals i work at mentioned about a KBBQ rumored to be opening in the area... Then later, at a visit to Serenade next door, saw a banner saying tofu hut (or something similar). Later it was named Doh Korean BBQ (still owned by tofu hut anyway but yeah) Lol   I had been a fan of tofu hut in the past purely because of its late night special for kbbq after a night of tennis or such costing like $14/person ($17 if u want steamed egg). So i had expected this place to be about the same.   Interior is completely different from any KBBQ i've been to or anything in town. Brightly lit with booths similar to Soyo/Hwaro but facing towards the room (weird... Lol) Whats UNIQUE about this place is they do not have the \"usual\" exhaust hoods way up in the ceiling, but they have the rarely seen anywhere (in the US) adjustable height hoods where you can lower just above the grill. For a table of 4, yeah you can see the person diagonally from you but its managable. The tube itself is not that wide. Benefits of adjustable hoods is they are in closer proximity to the grill, so lowering the chance of the smoke from the grill to escape outwards towards the customers or the restaurant. If you pay attention, you can actually see a slight \"windtunnel/tornado\" effect in the smoke, twirling its way up into the exhaust. YES ! finally someone had been able to put these into their restaurant after seeing it in Korean shows/dramas/etc for so long ! its an ingenious idea but maybe its costly to manufacturer/buy as it may not be produced in this country as opposed to the usual hoods. Definitely helps reducing the smell ON you but not 100% proof.   Back to the food. AYCE options $19.95 or $23.95 for dinner. The more expensive option allows for the order of ONE rib eye steak PER person. So essentially paying 4 bux to get a rib eye steak.   NOTE : apparently you get a different grill plate if you do get the rib eye.. more similar to one on a BBQ grill with the grates... i never tried it personally but thats what i heard from my friend  Ban chan (side dishes) include kimchi, ddukbokki, macaroni/potato salad thing, pickled daikon, and shredded pickled radish. Also the usual shredded salad   Each person gets a triple plate of jalapeno slices and garlic slices, bean paste, and sesame oil with salt n pepper. Initially not much in each spot (prob just in case people dont like it or dont use it, dont waste too much) but you can definitely ask for more.   Initially we ordered brisket, beef tongue, marinated kalbi (no limit), and pork belly. with a side of 2 steamed eggs.   The grill plate is the same usual but its un-oiled. Comes with a small block of fat (probably beef fat) to oil the plate. If you started with brisket and tongue like we do, thats definitely not enough and your meat will DEFINITELY stick. the ONE time it DIDNT stick is when we cooked the pork belly. TONS of fat from the belly. Definitely NON-STICK ! Would be nice if they oiled the grill plates themselves before putting it on the table or putting oil on it so the customer doesnt have to take this small block of fat and \"oil\" up themselves..   Brisket and tongue was great. Tender and delicious. Pork belly was nice. Good amount of meat to fat. Marinated kalbi (5 pieces) was tender. you can see they had put slices into the meat tenderizing the meat and the marinade tends to have something like kiwi or asian pear which is a natural tenderizer. So double tender. Also their marinade isnt overpowered and overly sweet like some places, but im still a \"unmarinated\" kind of person. Steamed egg is like the usual steamed egg. fluffy and water filled (well u do mix water into the egg before steaming... Lol). Light flavored as well.   Our second order of brisket and tongue. Tongue was good. Brisket was... uhm... well.. incident of \"would you like some meat with your fat?\" as each slice was like 75% fat 25% meat x_x   Bulgolgi is like the kalbi. tender. and not too sweet.   We had ordered beef tongue again, twice. Reason being that we realized they may have been doubling up on our orders initially, so when we ordered ONE order of beef tongue, it seemed so little. LOL.... Ordered a \"half order\" of the head-on shrimp as well. The waiter asked how many we wanted, so we gave him a number and he gave us that. Maybe works with things like pork belly too? since they are like frozen solid slices.   So in the end, similar to how the original Tofu Hut is. Minimal amount of selection. Not listed here was a few more pork belly options, and chicken. Oh also calamari. Though i did notice they dont have intestine, like Tofu Hut had (but i havent been there in years so i dunoe if they have it anymore...).   Overall, not bad. Service was pretty attentive. The waiter (not waitress) was super nice and attentive. Quick to deliver whatever requested. Our water was filled pretty often too.   Definitely a good location for those in the SW. Good to try for the price w/o the drive"}
{"text":"Doh Korean BBQ is a new Ayce Kbbq on the southwest/west side. They are part of the same restaurant group as Doh Sushi, Tofu Hut, and J Karaoke on Spring Mountain Rd. They are also located in the popular shopping complex that houses gelato shop Gelotology, coffee place Seranade, and the Rice n Noods. These guys are doing a solid job and it's a welcome addition to this neighborhood.  They have a couple of different menus; lunch, dinner 1, and dinner 2. Lunch is available until 3pm, Dinner 1 includes everything for lunch plus short ribs, and Dinner 2 includes everything for Dinner 1 plus rib eye. I chose lunch this time, but I would like to come again to try the dinners.  What I noticed first, Doh is using the more modern vents that more places are switching over to, a smaller fan that sucks up the smoke that is adjustable, rather than the old fashioned hoods that creates a lot of noise. After ordering, the food quickly started rolling out.  The banchan was good, and their kimchi is very good, aged correctly. The steamed egg came out, and it was good as well, nice and fluffy, without being watery.   My meats then started coming out. The brisket is excellent as well as their beef tongue. I thought their bulgogi is good, not at the Gen level, but good nonetheless.  The service was excellent, with my server asking if I needed anything, and asking if everything is good, which it was.  While Tofu Hut has been declining in service and food quality progressively through the years, I'm glad to report that Doh shows that a brand can reinvent themselves. Oh yea, one more thing...  Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr Ftr   Doh!!!!"}
{"text":"Refused to seat me because I came in solo, party of 1.  They said each table has a grill so their policy is to not seat single parties.  That's the first time I've ever been refused service due to being a single party.  They have smaller 2-seater tables that would have been just fine. I won't be coming back here due to the way they handled tonight."}
{"text":"Finally found a good Korean restaurant near our place. Not to mention it's all you can eat! Even my kids enjoy eating here. Very warm and friendly staff. They make sure that you are well taken cared of."}
{"text":"My family and I loves this place! We don't quite crave for Korean food all the time but when we do, this place always hits the spot!! I love how friendly and attentive the servers are, and even when it's busy, they can keep up with the pace. Thank you DOH for always keeping our bellies happy lol!"}
{"text":"From the same people that own Tofu Hut so the food is just as delicious! But what this place has over Tofu Hut is the service! I've sat in the booth area several times and each time they pretty much stay with you and cook and serve your meat! All I had to do was sit back relax and eat! Amazing service, amazing food!"}
{"text":"This is by far the closest thing to genuine Korean BBQ in Las Vegas. I was stationed in S. Korea for 13 months and I have been searching for a great Korean BBQ since.  This place is it, great food and service. All they're missing is the lettuce wraps!  But still awesome."}
{"text":"Customer service is always on point! Their soy bean paste soup is the best  definitely a place to come try, the best part is their all you can eat, everything is just great here"}
{"text":"I'm a huge Korean BBQ fan. First time here and it was cool. I didn't do AYCE just ala Carte and their portions were perfect. I got their bulgogi and brisket. Their brisket is bomb af probably one of the best I've seen out here. Not a big fan of the bulgogi but it's bulgogi so you gotta try it anyway. I wish they had fresh lettuce. Service started of okay got a younger guy Korean service and it was ehhhhh  then idk what happened to the guy and then got a lady server and she was on point !!! Overall it was a cool place I'll be back cuz of their brisket lol"}
{"text":"If I'm craving AYCE KBBQ, this is the spot! I love this place! Ever since these good a-la-carte KBBQ places opened up in the valley, I haven't had AYCE in awhile. However, sometimes I'm so hungry that I just want to indulge in some AYCE meat!   This place is cheap, close to my house and have such great service. The quality isn't comparable to non-AYCE KBBQ but it is probably one of the top ones for being AYCE. They also serve you a ton of side dishes and you can always ask for more if you run out! My favorite thing about Doh? Their salad!!! I literally eat the salad as my rice, I'm not sure what's their secret dressing but I can't ever get enough!   I highly recommend Doh if you're looking for an AYCE KBBQ. I've been here multiple times and there never seems to be a wait (which I'm surprised because it's so good!)."}
{"text":"I was really excited that an ayce kbbq was opening close to my house since i dont like driving to chinatown all the time for kbbq. My girlfriend and I came here for the first time last night and it was a less than satisfactory experience. It took them a while to take our order or to even bring us anything. The beef brisket was dry and the other meats were just ok. They didn't have brisket sauce and they couldnt give me extra salad dressing because \"its already mixed in.\" I guess. So anyway, I'll probably continue to make the trip to chinatown for Kbbq unless this place steps it up a bit."}
{"text":"We eat here at least ever other week!! The quaint restaurant has a nice vibe with music video wall  and friendly staff. Foods great of coarse!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried this place out last night (1/29/16), definitely had its ups and downs. Upon walking in we were sat in about 5 minutes. They only had one server working at the time, Ryan. Ryan was great very attentive, explained the menu and how everything worked since we were new to this particular kbbq spot. We ordered the brisket, beef tongue, beef bulgogi, red wine pork belly, and steamed egg. That was only the first round. Every thing we ordered came out timely and tasted great, good fat to meat ratio. I wish I could have said the same about the second half order of brisket I orders it was 60% fat. I had to trim it down with scissors. I also noticed about half way through the meal our server left to go home I guess because we had another woman attended to us, I didn't catch her name. Most places when a server leaves they will say something and introduce the server taking over their table, but oh well. The other server was very nice but she was alone and had a lot of fresh table to take care of in her own.   Overall not the best but also not the worst experience I've had at a kbbq place."}
{"text":"The food and the service are amazing.  The Banchan selection was great.  Each one had a distinct flavor that was very enjoyable.   We had the tongue and pork Bulgogi and they were amazing.  The Bulgogi was perfect.  I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Service = 4.5 stars  Food = 4.5 stars Cleanliness = 3.5 stars  Price = 4 stars  Reasonable price, wash area not as organized as it should, as I have observed no assign crew monitoring this part. We came around 9-10 pm. If you want to avoid long waiting you should go here. Overall, I will recommend this place to friends and family."}
{"text":"Recently went in for dinner and customer service was lacking in all areas. The three girls working the floor seemed to be more concerned with talking to each other and leaning up against their corner work area rather than attend to their guests. I'm not sure how much waiting time we allocated during but it seemed to be more than the time it took us to eat our food. When I looked around the restaurant, I would see other guests looking to get their attention as well. When we finished out food, our waitress that took our order cleared off some plates. We waited for our check, assuming she'd bring it since she asked if we were done and we replied yes. Nearly 10 min have passed and still nothing. We've made a couple eye contact with hem while they were in the corner talking, but no one came. As one walked by we said \"Excuse me can we get our check.\" She brings our check shortly after and we return it right away with our card. A different waitress comes to pick it up and as we hand her our bill, we ask for dessert since they never offered it. She looks down at our table and sees there are some meat  left and says she would have to charge us for the leftovers if we wanted our dessert. We said ok that's fine (although we've eaten here a dozen times and have left a little meat here and there and were never charged and still got our dessert). She goes to the register to swipe our card, the other lady who originally gave our bill goes up to her and before she swipes, tells her she was going to charge us extra for the meat, but soon realize they over charged us to begin with because the bill stated we ate rib eye but we didn't (it costs a little more). She brought our bill back and didn't end up charging us the extra for the meat since they already over charged us for the rib eye dinner price. This was probably the worst customer service I've had at this restaurant. We normally have a gentlemen as our waiter and they're usually pretty attentive. If those three girls spent half the time they did talking actually attending to their tables, they would have happier guests and happier guests mean better tips! I'm all for tipping 15% and up if the service is fairly reasonable, but that night unfortunately didn't deserve anymore than 10% The restaurant has cameras right above their work area, I hope who ever watches the recordings notices their work ethic, or lack of, each night they work together."}
{"text":"I am pretty much a KBBQ neophyte, so I certainly can't compare as a connoisseur.  Easy to find, once you know, less than a mile from 215 & Rainbow, south on Rainbow. The venue is tastefully-appointed, sort of an industrial-chic look.  Two visits. It was the best-of-times (2:30pm on a weekday) and the worst-of-times (8:00pm, Saturday, no reservation, right at 100% capacity). Still most every aspect was positive.  The servers were kind enough to provide a good bit of GIY (grill-it-yourself) tutoring during my initial weekday visit. My return on a Saturday night was the final exam, as they were really too busy to provide much further guidance. I think I earned at least a B in the course. (Then again, you know the old academic saying: Pay your fees and you get your Bs.)  The deal here is basically $17 AYCE lunch, $20 AYCE dinner.   The banchan (side dishes), again, I am not in a position to judge, but it was all pretty tasty. I focused my refill effort on the kimchi and a couple of the other items. Then I mostly hugged the rib-eye bulgogi (hey, it's rib-eye, right?). But I threw a bit of the short ribs in there as well. Servers were as attentive as they could be (obviously more so during the weekday visit.) Still I had to be a wee bit aggressive (both visits) to accomplish the more serious work: more meat on the grill, a grill cover swap, etc.--all while keeping an eye on their 90-minute AYCE countdown.  Again, everything was basically pretty tasty. They comped me a little ice-cream cookie desert to take out the door.  Note this is a branch of a rather popular KBBQ venue in Chinatown named Tofu Hut, so I take that as an additional stamp-of-approval for this venue.   This is likely one of the best/better options for KBBQ in this immediate area ... so have at. For myself, I am not feeling I will be turning into a KBBQ kind of gentleman, but I may hit it again from time to time."}
{"text":"I don't write many reviews, but my fiance and I had been hoping that a Korean BBQ restaurant would open near our house, and one finally did. Honestly, if it had been decent, I would be quite happy.   That being said, it was fantastic. $20 for all you can eat dinner, add $4 per person to get ribeye as well. The kimchi and daikon were both excellent. The salad was very good and the steamed egg was also well done.   The ribeye was actually the meat that may have been the worst, but it was still quite good. Not overly seasoned, but a fresh piece of meat that was quite good. The brisket, kalbi, and pork shoulder were all fantastic.   The modern vents they use were nice and didn't have to deal with the smoke of many of the other joins in ChinaTown. The service was absolutely outstanding as the drinks were constantly refused, we were offered more meats regularly, and they made sure if we wanted any additional sides, salads, or sauces that we were taken care of.  This is the type of place I can see myself returning to 40+ time per year if the service and quality remains anywhere near the level it was at on our first visit."}
{"text":"Super bomb place , love their all you can eat deal , it's a very cool neat place , the portions are good and the meat is marinated so well . Drop by and check them out !"}
{"text":"I've been down to Doh a couple of times now. For KBBQ, it is a little small compared to others, but the atmosphere is comfortable with their choice of decor and music in the background.   The service is quick and friendly: hostesses were attentive to refilling our water and banchan and making sure the heat on our grill was at a good temperature.  The selection of meats is pretty good as well. The best meats that I've tried there would hands down be their beef bulgogi and brisket. The shrimp, squid, and beef tongue were all good as well. We also ordered the mild chicken bulgogi and unfortunately, it was a miss for my entire table, so I would not recommend ordering it. We each finished off with a mochi ice cream (they have strawberry, mango, and green tea) which was a perfect ending to the meal.   To be honest, if you live nearby, Doh is worth going to, but I live on the opposite side of town and would pick others over it. However, if I found myself in the area, I would go and encourage others to give it a try."}
{"text":"Amazing, price is incredible and it's close to home food quality is on point and service is spot on. Location by far cleanest and nicest of all places I've been on spring mountain. Must try!"}
{"text":"I would come back again! Loved the brisket and salad! Priced right . Servers super attentive. Clean and great southwest location.  Went back again don't like their \"standard gratuity\" of 4 or more people you pay 18% tip! I thought it was 6 or more."}
{"text":"I don't know if I was expecting this place to be exactly like tofu hut but I was left disappointed. First off, they \"oil\" the grill with pork fat.. What? The customer service, along with the food is mediocre. They don't have gochujang like they do at tofu hut, so I was a bit disappointed. The best thing here is probably the beef tongue and brisket. Ventilation is good, I'm not left smelling completely like KBBQ which I normally do. I dont know if I'm willing to give this place another chance. But as of right now, there's better kbbq places."}
{"text":"The meat was served in small portions and it was busy when we came on a Wednesday night so service wasn't great. I liked the cleanliness of the restaurant and the cool exhaust fan that lowers to the stove. The meat options were pretty limited and I feel there are other KBBQ places that'll give you a better bang for you buck. The typical steam egg wasn't included in the AYCE price and was an add-on so that was interesting. They served the 5 typical side dishes that were underwhelming. I will continue to look for a KBBQ place in the neighborhood to satisfy the occasional cravings!"}
{"text":"This establishment was a very happy surprise find!! My friend said we were going out and he took us here, and I was blown away with both the food (which was in simplest words, divine), and the service by Ryan! He killed the customer service game and really made the whole occasion feel incredibly special! Thank you Ryan, and thank you Doh for making a boring Wednesday night into something amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Doh Korean BBQ is a place where you and your groups of six can hang out plus talk. It is neat and clean place. They have air hood which help to minimize the burning smell and smokes. Also, the price can be little costy depending what meats you order. For me, i get \" all you can eat \" which is about $20-40 dollars. there is not a lot of selection of meats unlike spring mountain but it is good for those who live near by south rainbow Blvd."}
{"text":"It's delicious and everyone is so attentive. Loved meeting Jimmy and learning how to do Korean BBQ. I hope to be the new regular."}
{"text":"Updating my review to 5 stars since my changing table review has been addressed. We really love this place esp. Their salad. Although we just had hwaro for the same price and realized doh doesnt have as much to offer on their menu, 20$ for all you can eat kbbq meat  still satisfies the craving when you don't feel like driving all the way to chinatown. The staff here is also super friendly"}
{"text":"Walked in, and it felt like Koreatown! Playing awesome K-POP videos the atmosphere is absolutely top notch!   Unfortunately for me, I have a picky Korean BBQ hating boyfriend. The banchan wasn't as good as I hoped for, and the marinades are pretty much similar in taste. I love that they have separate. grills for the different meats, and change the grills often! We ordered the veggie tempura side... they should probably change the name because it was more like a fried frisbee of vegetables.   This will unfortunately be a last resort if we don't feel like driving to Chinatown."}
{"text":"Food was good. Establishment was comfy. The greeting staff needs to be better when greeting people. You cannot be seated until your entire party is complete. What I didn't like is how she told us bc it was said coldly as if we were a nuisance for coming to eat there. The only reason we ate there was bc one of my girlfriends likes the place despite the staff's demeanor. But I would not return."}
{"text":"We love KBBQ. This location is nice, clean and service is way better than the majority of KBBQ restaurants on spring mountain (if you've been in Vegas a while, you know what I mean) They added Mochi, which is awesome."}
{"text":"if you like cheap meat - go for it... being asian i guess i have a higher expectation for the BBQ and service.... there are plenty better ones out there if you search..."}
{"text":"Food was great as well as the service.  We truly enjoyed the experience and will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I used to go to this restaurant when it was located in China Town. That location was never really busy for some reason. The food was decent but the restaurant seemed unnecessarily large for the number of tables they had. I like this new location a lot better. It's in a quieter shopping plaza off the Las Vegas Strip which likely makes this location a lot more accessible to locals. Tons of parking available. Located right next to Serenade which is a perfect spot for dessert after AYCE KBBQ since Doh's dessert offering is pretty much limited to just a few flavors of pre-packaged mochi. The place is clean and food hits the mark for standard KBBQ (nothing groundbreaking but good food). The staff is very friendly and accommodating, regularly checking up on you but not overbearing. They also project KPOP music videos onto the wall for your viewing pleasure (if you're into that!). The one thing that isn't ideal about the KBBQ set up (though I won't hold it against them) is the overhead air vents. They come down to eye level when you're cooking off the grill so you basically can't see the person sitting across from you. Similar KBBQ restaurants like Gyu Kaku have ventilation systems built into / surrounding the grill which eliminate the need for an overhead vent and the suffocating smoke that rises from cooking off the grill. Again, not a major issue but it is a little annoying given that there are now more convenient grill set ups at similar restaurants in the city."}
{"text":"The quality of meat was just okay. Most of the variety that came with the beef combo were very tough and chewy.   The panchang were great. However, if I'm craving Korean BBQ, I think I'd still drive to hobak in Chinatown. The beef there is more tender and more flavorful, in my opinion.   Really wished this place could do better since it's soooooo close to where I live"}
{"text":"I went out with a group of friends and I super enjoyed it. The only thing I will recommend is call them in advance if you are dinning out with more than 6 people in your party, because the place is small to be able to accommodate large groups.  The quality of their AYCE meats are impressive and not to mention their side dishes (ban-chan) are delicious as well.   Their service is excellent, I think our table asked so much and never saw or heard them complaint. They just continue to assist us with a genuine smile from start to finish, that's freaking excellent customer service.   I enjoy the food, the company and the atmosphere of a place."}
{"text":"First time trying this place and was impressed! Doh is near where I live so it is convenient, I don't have to drive to Chinatown for AYCE BBQ. The place is in the corner of the Smith's place, next to Gelatology and Serenade. The place is very nice and clean, lots of tables, good for large and small parties. They have one of those tubular vent that is pulled all the way down so it captures more of the smoke than the ones from the ceiling, I left Doh not smelling too much like grilled meat.   We came at a slower time around 5:30, were seated immediately and our orders were quickly taken. Even later when more and more tables came in, the staff were still very attentive, water was re-filled, empty plates were picked up, staff were also very friendly, service was great!  They have 1 lunch price, and two dinner prices. We went with the Dinner I (which does not include 1 strip of rib-eye). At first I thought that Steamed egg and rice were extra because of the way it was listed on the menu, but we were not charged when we got our check, so many only if you want seconds?!?!   We got two orders of brisket, tongue and pork belly, 1 of short rib. The short rib and pork belly both come with 2 strips/order, their brisket and tongue were quite large per order. All meats were very good, the tongue stood out especially, so fresh and \"crunchy.\" AYCE comes with: a big bowl of salad and 7 sides.   Overall I like this place, especially for Dinner I being $19.95. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Rocky start, but one of the best Korean BBQ spots I've had in Vegas! Great value for AYCE and the quality is excellent - noticeably better than other places around town.  Everything we had was delicious and the meat was very tender! My favorites in order are the rib eye, pork shoulder tied for second place with the short ribs (boneless kalbi), then chicken bulgogi. The ban chan was also good and I'm glad it came with a salad, to break up the meat extravaganza.   The decor is clean and contemporary, very inviting and comfortable with large tables. We sat at a communal table, which usually I hate, but it was spacious enough where I didn't feel claustrophobic.  My only criticism is service. They recently opened and perhaps wasn't expecting such a large turnout, but they are clearly understaffed. When we walked in, no one was at the front desk to check us in. We saw numerous staff running around and finally I flagged someone down to check us in. The wait for a table wasn't too long though.  In our section, our server was also checking in guests, bussing/clearing tables, taking orders and serving food. So needless to say, she wasn't very attentive to the tables. She was clearly working as hard as she could, but additional staff is definitely needed."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, once for lunch and once for dinner. Dinner was definitely a lot busier, but there was no difference in service; both times it was attentive and polite. This was my first time trying Korean BBQ, and I had no idea what to expect. The food was really delicious, though, and the concept was intriguing. It definitely felt more fun cooking the food ourselves over the grill than if we had just had it delivered to our tables fully-cooked.   The menu/pricing was a little confusing at first: you can order one meat entree for a set price or pay a couple dollars more for all-you-can-eat. If one person at the table chooses all-you-can-eat, everyone has to get it. Lunch hovers around $15 and for an all-you-can-eat dinner, it's between $20-25 depending on if you want the pricier meats. For parties of 4 or more, there's an automatic 18% gratuity added.   Both times I went, everyone in my party had a really great time and were impressed by both the service and the flavorful food. I loved how nicely Doh was decorated, too; it's definitely a spot I'll be returning to!"}
{"text":"I visited Doh with my friends and my baby. At first, everything is great but then at the end we were trying to change the grill because the grill is turning all black. The waitress didn't want to change the grill for us because they said they don't change grill for shrimp! I don't get why the grill already looking like this and the waitress wouldn't change the grill for us! She literally turned around and walked away! Although she came back with new grill but the customer service I received was very unexpected and bad! I had visited Doh many times, this was the worst customer service I had with them. The waitress name is Crystal. After I talked to the manager, Crystal came to our table and said you still feel bad after I change the grill for u? Trying to reason with us. Unbelievable bad customer service!!!!"}
{"text":"Great all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ place.  We always try to come here at least once when in the city.  Good quality meats and tasty sides.  Only recommendation is go hungry!"}
{"text":"I like this place but having been to Hobak in Korean town many times I can't help but compare. Doh's food is good but not high quality. Very busy place and it was very cold next to the doors so we got lucky we got a booth. The service was good but not very friendly. Fast service (they do hustle to clean up tables and bring food) and we did not need to ask twice for what we wanted, or repeat orders. The \"all you can eat\" price is a bargain if you have teenagers or a big appetite. Overall a good little spot for a casual week evening meal, but not for a special occasion! I will go back because it is the closer Korean barbecue to our home, and overall the experience was ok."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars, trust me; I would. I arrived at the restaurant right before the dinner rush, so the server on shift quickly seated us and got out dinner started. She was polite and patient with us as my dinner partner and I ordered. Our third guest arrived shortly thereafter.  While waiting for our drinks to be served, we noticed a small, white block on our grill. Since the server did not initially tell us what it was, we were immediately disgusted at the realization that it could be leftover food from the previous guests. When we asked her what it was, the server told us that it is a fatty substance used to oil the grill.   Our dinner lasted for approximately one hour. In that time, many tables had come and gone. I felt like the only way I could get attention from my server was if I stood on top of the table and waved my arms in the air. At one point, I waved at her for a drink refill. She looked at me and ducked into the kitchen. I thought she might've been waiting for an order to come out, so I waited. A few moments passed and she seemed to ignore me, so I got my refill myself.    Finally, when we asked for the check, we were informed our card would be charged $45 for the price of 2 AYCE guests. We were a party of three, but my dinner partner and I intended to pay for only the both of us. When the server returned, however, we noticed she had charged us $65 without informing us about the change. Unprofessional."}
{"text":"Seriously the worst staff I've ever come across. Good food don't get me wrong but literally that ruined it by the staff and taking an HOUR to pay our bill and them over charging and splitting everything incorrectly. Just AWFUL."}
{"text":"Great servers, the ambiance of the restaurant is nice. Great food The prices are doable."}
{"text":"Such a cute Korean bbq spot. Love the brick and white granite theme. The booth is the place to sit at. Super clean and a lot of room and private in a way. So much sides. Exciting thing is that they had japchae which not a lot of places have that as a side regularly. They're salad is super good with a hint of spicyness to it and the salad is shredded which I like so I can get mix my bbq and salad in every bite :D my boyfriend said the macaroni salad is good, even asked for seconds lol the price is great. 16 for lunch 19 for dinner and it includes all meat with shrimp and squid if u want! Very clean utensils and service was great. Our waiter even cooked the meat for us while we stuffed our mouths which was nice. Lol I would compare it to hwaro on spring mountain. Love how rainbow is blowin up so many new Asian spots. So convenient than driving all the way to Chinatown."}
{"text":"I love the sides it's super fresh and tasty. We normally go to Gen so this is a closer option for all you can eat. I wish that their portion were a little smaller so we can try other dishes without ordering a ton."}
{"text":"Korean BBQ on a budget! If your low on cash and don't care about quality of meat & service then come here. AYCE K BBQ. Don't get me wrong for the price the food is decent. What really turned me off was I brought a cake for my friends birthday and at the end of the meal the server brought the cake out to our table in its original bag and box. I mean seriously wtffff? The server is that lost that you don't know that you bring the cake out ready to serve?????  She literally placed the cake in the center of our table in its original packaging and plastic bag? That right there dropped this review down to 2 stars."}
{"text":"Soooo me and the husband are a big fan of AYCE KBBQ, he's a big guy that likes his \"protein\" lol. After 2 failed attempts of 40 minute waits in Spring Mountain for a table for KBBQ, we decided to stick closer to home with the thanks of Yelp to the rescue. We were sorta hesitant, but upon walk in on a Monday night (8pm), we were able to seat at a booth right away. I would say the booths are nice, reminded me of where you can take off your shoes and high walls enclosed in where you're able to look out onto the cool industrial decor and clock with a projector featuring K Pop music.  All right let's get to the food and service, $23 dinner (Monday night) for AYCE is awesome, this includes rice as well if you're wondering, husband didn't know because of the charge of sides prices on the menu below. Service was great, we had two people serving us, checking our grill, needed any extra sides (they give you good sides prior to your meat coming - salad was really good and their kimchi, mild flavor), or more meat. Food was marinated well! I stuck with the bulgogi (spicy and sweet marinated) meats, also the sliced meats. How can you complain when you can cook it yourself. Husband liked the experience, as I as well. The space and area was clean. It was a nice mom and dad time (90 mins for AYCE), and a coffee shop next door if you're hindering for free wifi and a cup of joe post meal."}
{"text":"Food is good and always get great service from Chang and Ann!  Pork shoulder is my favorite!!"}
{"text":"Food is reasonably priced and everything we had were very good. Kids fave is the steamed egg. My fave is the salad surprisingly. I hope they will offer more seafood. All sides are good except the sauteed seaweeds. Overall its a great b place and I'll be visiting again."}
{"text":"Felt like KBBQ but didn't feel like driving all the way to Chinatown so I was super happy when we found one by our house. I was a little reluctant because I had heard some bad things about this place but I have to say, i was pretty pleased with the food and service. The food was actually really good. The bulgogi had tons of flavor both the short rib and shredded. The brisket was amazing (words of my son) and the side dishes were all an added touch. They offered tons of sides. Its an AYCE so make sure to come hungry.   Service was also great. We were checked on quite a bit and offered more of things we were running low on before it was actually gone. I'm glad we found this place now we don't have to drive so far."}
{"text":"No vegetarian friendly option. They used to have a radish cold noodle but removed it, only thing offer is hot stew or bbq.   Bbq non marinated meat is good, marinated taste old and soggy.   Overall decent food for price range.  Update: doh is very consistent with their food quality and I think overall I always enjoy my visit there. They added free ice cream mochi at the end of the meal, but it is a hit or miss. Some days they do run out.   The marinated beef is a hit or miss, make one order to make sure it taste well before adding anymore."}
{"text":"Food: 5/5 - Nothing to complain about here! Our first time and the food was delicious.   Service: 5/5 - The service was fantastic! The waiter  made sure to check up on us and everything was out in a timely matter.   Location: 4/5 - There's a lot going on in this plaza so parking was a little difficult, but there's a couple of dessert options for after you finish here.   Price: 5/5 - We did the dinner 1 AYCE option, I believe it was $20. Worth it! I believe there is also the option of not getting AYCE.   I would definitely recommend this place, great price for great all you can eat KBBQ!"}
{"text":"First time here... Seen plenty of my friends eating here, so it was about time I experience for myself. No wait for lunch, we were seated right away. Wait staff was very friendly and attentive. Food quality was good, sides were also good. Salad was similar to Tofu Hut since they're the same family of restaurants. Grill vent is high-tech and very strong, so you don't smell like bbq...lol. Water was great! I don't know why, must be the plastic pitcher with the Soju advertising...lol. Steamed egg was on fleek...lol. Will be coming back soon."}
{"text":"Clean interior. Reminds me of soyo.   I like the grills with the lowered fans.  Blocks the view across the table but definitely keeps the smoke out of your face.  All you can eat is great when you have a good appetite.  Ideal during lunch hours.    I wish they had bean sprouts but I've been told their sides are always different. Sometimes they have it, sometimes they don't?  Tastes more fresh and clean than other places.  Very good service here too!  I have to say I still favor a 24 hour Korean bbq spot on spring mtn."}
{"text":"I'll preface this by saying that my husband and I are virgins...when it comes to Korean barbecue I mean. He had just gotten off a long cross country flight, so I picked him up from the airport and knew I would need to feed him quickly before hanger set in.   We were seated immediately and decided to do the AYCE option so we could try multiple things. The server quickly brought out a large bowl of salad and a bunch of smaller dishes of different sides (banchan.) The salad was delicious, loved the dressing. I also liked the kimchi and the rice noodle dish.   We told the servers it was our first time, and they were both great about showing us what to do. We took their recommendations for ordering our protein, and got the brisket, the short rib, pork bulgogi, pork shoulder, and sweet and spicy chicken bulgogi.   The brisket was my favorite, and my husband liked the short rib best. The pork was fattier than we would have liked, as was the chicken. We agreed we wanted to try it again, but probably won't do the AYCE option again.   Loved the decor, very steam punk. I wish my chair would have had a back on it, I felt sort of exposed and was uncomfortable.   One of those situations where a half point rating would be good - I would really consider this to be a 3.5/5 for me."}
{"text":"DOH IS THE SPOT.  The price per person is typical KBBQ. The place is clean and trendy, which makes it a perfect location for a date or for a meet up with friends. The service was on point-- very helpful and happy to bring new plates of meat.   The meat was great quality and well worth the price, which can be a hit or miss with AYCE. But you know what makes this place different than all the other KBBQ places?-- the salad. What is in that dressing? It was magical and I ate so much damn salad. Definitely not your cheapy KBBQ filler salad. I didn't think it was possible for me to eat more salad than meat at AYCE BBQ.  Oh and if I wasn't already completely content with our meal-- you get a mochi ice cream included with your dinner. Oh yeah!  Doh, you da real MVP of KBBQ!"}
{"text":"Best quality and value in town. I wish their tofu soup doesn't cost extra. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"I've been on the hunt for THE ayce kbbq in vegas since moving here from socal. I was hoping it would be Doh but I have yet to find it..  The staff is really friendly and the place looks really clean, but the main food wasn't all that good so i gave it a 3 star. My hunt continues.  The food: their samgyupsal (pork) was disappointing; dry and thin.. their kimchi was really good though. Their marinated wannabe kalbi was disgusting lol The only thing on the menu worth ordering was the chadol (brisket) but know that anywhere you go the first plate of chadol is the best so order a lot. Their chadol dipping sauce wasnt really for me, since i dont like that horsradish taste. Their steamed egg was really good, the banchans were good. But there was NO rice paper! :(  Also, the way Koreans eat is we order rice and bean paste stew at the end of the meat session. The staff warned me not to get it because it isnt good and Korean customers have expressed disappointment before. So I didnt order it and got kimchi jigae instead. It was pretty good, and then i realized ayce didnt include the stews lol -.- So note that stews are additional 4.95, half of what they charge normally."}
{"text":"This new Korean bbq spot is great! Friendly staff who are also very quick with orders. The design on the inside of the restaurant is very modern/urban. My boyfriend and I felt that this design created a nice and relaxed atmosphere in the restaurant! :)  Prices are decent, similar to hwaro. All in all, this is our new favorite Korean bbq spot :)"}
{"text":"Yesterday we tried a new Korean BBQ place called Doh. The food was amazing welly seasoned and marinated. Although the service was horrible the waiter did not speak to us she had an attitude the whole time she was speaking very low and wasn't mumbling her words, but the environment is nice I love the sitting down and cooking your own food environment all in all the rating is a 5"}
{"text":"I must say I was very excited when I heard a Korean BBQ place offering All You Can Eat was opening up in the area. So excited that I'd frequently pass by and peak in the window to see if they were open. It's basically near Serenade, Gelatology, and Rice n Noodles on south Rainbow.  Well the good news is that they're now open and for all of us in the area or South West in general no more long drives to Chinatown to indulge in AYCE Korean BBQ only to be stuck in a food coma and worrying about getting home.  The bad news is that service needs improvement but understandable for a new business. Not that they were mean or anything. They just needed an occasional nudge or reminder that we ordered something and never got it, we need more food or water, etc. They came around to change the grill too often and they were pretty slow at bringing food out.   They have 3 AYCE options Lunch $16.95, Dinner I $19.95, and Dinner II $23.95 basically the only difference besides the price and time of day is you're adding boneless short ribs with Dinner I and  you're adding that and ONE ORDER PER PERSON of a 6-8 oz rib eye prime with Dinner II. They'll bring out some sides like kim chi to start but you'd have to pay extra for more.   I wanna say they don't have to many selections with 5 beefs (brisket, tongue, bulgogi, boneless shortribs, and rib eye), 4 porks (two pork bellies, shoulder, and bulgogi), 2 chickens (spicy or mild bulgogi), and 2 seafoods (head on shrimp and squid). I enjoyed the beef short ribs, pork shoulder, and red wine pork belly. Everything else was ok.   You don't have to eat AYCE but it seems like pretty much once you buy 2 orders of meat you've paid for AYCE.  The interior is nice. The vent system they have is good at sucking all the smoke out but because it's low and right above the grill it's in the way. You can't really see the person in front of you without looking under or around the vent. I guess it's good if you're by yourself and don't want everyone else to see you."}
{"text":"We were in the way to a different restaurant when we found Doh and I'm sooo glad we stopped here instead.   We had to park a couple of blocks away and could smell the amazing aromas of Doh from the minute we got out of our truck. Once we realized where it was coming from, we abandoned our original plans in favor of Doh.   This was my first experience with Korean Barbecue. Doh won me over immediately. We opted for the all you can eat so we taste all of the varieties of meats available. In all, we tried the pork belly, squid, shrimp, bulgogi, brisket, & ribeye. All were fabulous. The Korean salad and dipping sauces were a perfect compliment. I was pleasantly surprised at the value considering generous portions.   Staff was very knowledgable (we had Adrian) and he was very helpful in explaining things to me and making recommendations.   Doh is a must visit."}
{"text":"One of my good friends treated me out for a belated birthday dinner, and I really wish I picked somewhere else. I'm not sure if this is another Tofu Hut or is it owned by Doh? I don't like Tofu Hut, but if you're a fan then this might be a good spot for you because this is what their quality of meat reminded me of. For 20 dollars per person I would rather go to Hwaro. To begin, my friend and I ordered beef brisket, pork belly, and two steamed eggs. We got the brisket first, but turns out it wasn't brisket... it was beef tongue.. GROSS. I hate beef tongue and so does my friend.  The taste of beef tongue haunted me the rest of the night. They tried covering their mistake by saying it was brisket but we could taste it wasn't, which was really annoying. We had to remind our server to give us our pork belly, and half way through our meal we finally got our steamed eggs but we had to remind him. Our server was extremely forgetful, and it was truly a bothersome to remind him about every single thing. The interior is nice though, it reminds me of Korea but that is about the only good thing about this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is the one and only great all you can eat ayce Korean BBQ spot. Excellent fast service, clean facility and yummy food!!!"}
{"text":"I really love this Korean bbq place. It's really convenient because It's close to the house. The food here is better than most of the places in China town. The price is really affordable and I love that it's AYCE. There are three different prices and different food that go with it. I especially love the japchae and salad they have."}
{"text":"Serving and food presentation were great here. Love the stainless steel used for everything. Banchan and meats were just ok for me. Maybe even below average. Scratched this place off my bookmarks, but sadly, we won't be returning. So many other kbbq spots in town with the same price, but better quality meats."}
{"text":"I had my first time here today. To start off, I'm the biggest kbbq fan so out of the the places I went to, this place is definitely a so-so. To talk about the atmosphere, it's a little restaurant with many places to seat mostly benches. We came around 6pm so it got a little busy with more and more people coming. I could tell it's a famous one that's why it definitely packed on a normal weekday. Service - we were greeted right away when we walked in and seated after 3 mins. Lady came and got our orders and brought out pretty much it. Other than that we were pretty much having have to help ourselves. Unless when we really needed something, we would have to struggle a lot to get the servers attention. Ok I get it you're busy and there's only 2 of you, but you gotta come check on ur customer atleast once to see if their grills need to be change or not.  Food quality is fine. Don't get me wrong it was delicious but was not the best I had. Most disappointed thing is the squid. It looks so good looks like it has been seasoned really well but turned out taste like straight squid nothing else.  Will come back!"}
{"text":"Granted it's right across the street from my house but I think they have the best AYCE KBBQ for the price in Las Vegas. It's ~$20 for dinner and the sides are always delicious!"}
{"text":"Service-on point Food-on point   It's far from me but when the family said this was where we were meeting for our family dinner I was onboard!! Food is great and service is too! It is a time limit so don't think you have all night to eat up!"}
{"text":"I'm happy there is a Korean bbq restaurant on the southwest side of town instead of having to go to Chinatown. My first time I've ever been here I was satisfied with how clean the restaurant was and the modern look they have. The chopsticks are not wood. The food is honestly about the same as any other AYCE chain but I prefer this place mainly for its location and how clean it is."}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome! Yup, it's not in Spring Mountain. It's here on the southwest side, which is good so you don't have to go all the way to Chinatown to eat some Korean BBQ. I'm so lucky to have this place just near my house! It's near the smiths, right beside Serenade. So we got the Dinner, $19.99 per person. You can have everything right there on the menu except for the dessert and the prime ribeye. Their sides are so good, fish cakes, salad, macaroni salad, Korean style noodles, and many more. For the meats, we ordered a lot!! Pork belly, Beef brisket, Marinated Chicken (glad it was like a mild one, not spicy!) And they got some seafood too! Hell yeah! Shrimp and squid, you better not skip those! One thing I didn't like was this place is kinda small. You're gonna have to share like a long table with other customers. A long table that is divided between two parts.. but mostly everything was pleasant! Good quality of food, good customer service, good place to come back for Korean BBQ :)"}
{"text":"I went there for dinner with friends to try out the new restaurant yesterday and It was ridiculously slow! There was only 1 male server and it was rush hour. How can a restaurant have only 1 server during dinner hours when it gets busy?!"}
{"text":"Hands down, very good price for a lot of food. The atmosphere was great service was great! I would def go back and visit this Korean BBQ!"}
{"text":"I have to admit, I Am huge Korean eatery fan, and this by far is my favorite Korean bbq! Man so good and so much better the Gen in Henderson.  They have much more selection and the meats are so delicious! The sides are on point too. I can't wait to eat here again lol"}
{"text":"Love this place. Atmosphere, food, and the sides! If you like having a lot of sides with your Korean bbq then come here. The all you can eat prices are very reasonable, and I prefer this place to bring a group because of that. I've been to other Korean bbq joints where you pay a set price for a set amount of food with a group and honestly felt super jipped because A) the price B) I didn't get a lot of food. Whereas here at Doh you can order a plate for yourself while everyone else can do there thing etc. just easy!"}
{"text":"The all you can eat menu is definitely worth it.  The water glasses are small which I find a little weird but they leave the pitchers of water on every table to make up for it.  The service is pretty consistent.  The staff is helpful and polite.  The whole restaurant seems to work together as I'm never quite sure who my server really is.  You can see right into the kitchen from some tables and the back of house staff doesn't have an actual uniform so there's a bit of a weird vibe when it comes to that.  All in all I definitely recommend giving the AYCE menu a chance."}
{"text":"A great BBQ joint. The quality is very good and the price is reasonable. The service is a little slow hence the 4 star. The decor is nice and cute. My wife loves this place even though it's quite a drive for us."}
{"text":"Didn't know this gem of a place was so close to my area.  It's a breath of fresh air that I didn't need to drive to China town to enjoy some Korean BBQ.  Loved the fact that they had then Japchae as part of the free accompaniments they give you whenever you do all you can eat.  Went here middle of the day so wait was not bad. I can imagine this place to get very busy at night.  Consider relocating to a more visible location. You guys are quite hidden!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are foodies.  The first time we visited this restaurant we were with my sister and her husband. Our server was great and attentive but the lady who took our checks screwed up horribly and my sister was charged double the price and unable to get her money returned for almost 2 wks!  She was ignored every time she called.  The only reason my husband and I went back was because our home is nearby and we were craving KBBQ.  The same lady who screwed up my sister's check seated us.  She wears glasses and ties her hair back. She never came to check on us to take any orders. We had to holler for her.  My husband was communicating with her in Korean so I didn't understand what they were saying, but I can tell he's was getting frustrated.  After he ordered us beer and 2 types of meat apparently she kept cutting him off and said \"that's it right?\" And he said no also can we have etc etc...  And she just kept cutting him off so he got angry even further.  Again she never came back and so another server came and we said our order of meat never arrived. He was nice and pleasant. She came back with an attitude and without a word said just did a drive by meat drop off.  My husband had to get her attention AGAIN for some extra sauce. Her reply was \"that small one is enough you won't finish it.\" I thought that was rude!  I work in the customer service industry and I would NEVER BE THAT RUDE, EVER.  Even if my customer was a jerk I would still be nice since it is my job to please the public.  When we finished I went up to the register myself and of course she came quickly to take my payment. Ignored us the entire time we were eating with a rude demeanor but quick to close my meal ticket. I'm not a jerk and I still tipped a fair amount- which she did not deserve. Granted I know a restaurant can be busy and stressful, I watched her tend to the other tables with a smile over and over while we were ignored for some reason.  Perhaps my husband and I should've spoken to her in English maybe then she would have treated us better? We are very polite and courteous people so I don't understand when people are rude for no reason. I don't think we will be returning there. Which is a shame because it is so close to our neighborhood. I guess we will go far when we want KBBQ.  All in all this is the 2nd time the service was horrible from that lady. The only reason I gave this place 2 starts was because the food is OK.  The steamed egg could use a little garnish.  The meat is excellent. Enjoyed the tongue the most.  And the Kalbi short ribs we got were so pounded out that they looked like a fence as they were cooked and that made them tasted grainy.  Didn't understand why this time it was so pounded out. Beer selection is pretty good compared to other Kbbq places. The seafood selection is OK.  Others don't have the option of shrimp. But most people prefer the baby  octopus rather than squid.  Food is great- the service we received from that woman is terrible.  The other servers are pleasant.  Maybe we will consider returning one day but if she seats us again we are walking out and going elsewhere."}
{"text":"It's ok. Not too many choices as far as what I was looking for. I wanted intestines only tongue was available. At least it curbed the Korean Bbq craving"}
{"text":"Been to Doh a few times and it was fine but last night was the worst.. wish we could give 0 star. Service was bad.. meats and items all taste the same.. either no flavor, to spicy or like sesame oil.. servers were rude and would tell us we were cooking wrong and we asked for extra chapchee and they gave us a small plate of it overflowing w attitude .. Rude!. tempura was so oily and salad was unedible and had to ask for our order of brisket 3 times.. Worst part was after we paid we realized they over charged us and charged us for dinner 2 $23.95 instead of the dinner 1  like we ordered.. Horrible cheaters!!  We will Never go back again as there are so many better and friendlier and non cheating Korean bbq places!!! And Beware make sure you check your bill as these guys will try to over charge you for dinner!!!!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite AYCE KBBQ places! I guess I always luck out whenever I go for lunch or dinner because there seems to be a table waiting for me compared to other people. Although, it does get busy. Usually by the tend I finish eating, there seems to be some sort of wait for tables.   Doh is your typical KBBQ restaurant. You select what you want off the menu, the staff brings it to you, you cook it, you eat it, etc. Comes with usual sides, oil&salt, brisket sauce, and salads. You can order the steamed egg if you'd like. Unfortunately the only have rice; no rice paper, but that's how most places are in Vegas. :(  The thing that stands out about Doh is their staff! The staff is always friendly and attentive. They are consistently walking around seeing if you need anything, filling waters, and changing your grill when it is all charred up. They also help you cook your food from time to time although I usually waive them off as I or whoever I go like to do it ourselves.  After you're all done and ready to pay the bill, they offer you mochi ice cream. What better way to counter the taste of bulgogi, brisket, and pork belly (my typical orders) with good ole ice cream?"}
{"text":"AYCE.. but NOT a lot of variety of meat.  Only 4 beef, 3 pork(NOT GOOD) and 2 chicken and maybe 1 or 2 seafood.  The decor is just like Hobak Korean BBQ.. small and the vent is not good cuz I smell like BBQ afterwards.  The girl waitress is awful, doesn't smile or talk to us.. and we have to pay 18% gratuity (so wrong)!!   Even tho it's closed to Home I don't think I'm coming back to this.. I'll stick with Gen in Henderson.."}
{"text":"I really tried to like this place based on the yelp reviews but I couldn't bring myself too... The menu was limited, the salad was soggy, the cuts of meat were small, they did not seem fresh, and they were definitely bland and flavorless despite having the dipping sauce. The short rib bulgogi was were I pretty much drew the line...it had the consistency of ground beef and I couldn't even eat it. For $23.99, it was truly a disappointment."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. What a fun experience! I wasn't sure what to expect but I was open minded. When we arrived, we were immediately greeted by our waitress, Anne. She was warm and friendly and sat us immediately. Before I could even glance at the menu she had arrived with water, salad, and sides that included kimchee, tempura veggies, macaroni salad, potatoes noodles  (YUM!), and more along with three different dipping sauces. My date and I ordered the All you can eat 2 dinner special. We had prime rib, steaks, shrimp and beef tongue. Everything was superb. Anne was very attentive and explained everything as this was my first time ever eating Korean BBQ. The beef tongue was by far the best. My recommendation is to let it crisp as much as possible then dip it in the bean paste and eat with rice. AMAZING. While we were eating, I accidentally dropped my chop sticks and as soon as I turned around to call Anne for another set, she was already behind me with a fresh set and some napkins. She was fantastic. I have only ever experienced this kind of service once before and it is very rare. I would definitely recommend this restaurant and I will be visiting again soon!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  We live in Lake Havasu and come up to Vegas for cultural eating experiences, and this place a must do!!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Saw the reviews on Yelp and decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did, I love Korean bbq.   Fast service, friendly staff, very clean, and awesome food.   Price is very reasonable for all you can eat. I will definitely be visiting again."}
{"text":"Yay for fermented soybean! And love that this place is so close to home. It's not a huge menu but what more do you need when everything they have is great. Ask for RYAN!!"}
{"text":"Love this place and its so close to my house, never had a bad experience and I have been here plenty of times.!"}
{"text":"We arrived 10:50 pm, and it's supposed to close at midnight, they didn't allow us to sit saying that last call was already in progress..."}
{"text":"The newest addition to my KBBQ binge eating days itinerary, if I ever did see one.   My friends told me it was a step up from the Doh or Tofu Hut on Spring Mountain we used to frequent. For the most part, they did not disappoint whatsoever. It may be on the other side of town, but the food experience was definitely worth the travel and expense.   Service: quick + super friendly + highly personable   We didn't wait that long to get seated even with nine people. The staff were very accommodating and the guys who waited on our group of nine were hilarious. There was also a really sweet ahjumma who would come around to make sure everything was okay and if we wanted more rice. Otherwise, it is a family sit down type service where you do your own cooking of the meats provided (typical of any KBBQ place).    Atmosphere: comfortable + relaxing   We sat at a long bench with two grills on opposite ends which was effective in serving such a large group. The overall decor is a modern twist on a rustic country look, and they have an interesting projector feature as the main fixture against a brick wall where one can watch Korean music videos throughout the experience too. So when you're eating you can have the option of entertainment in the background, which was cool too.    Pricing: semi-decent + worth it  It's worth it if you stick to the all you can eat options for lunch and dinners. It's a good steal considering the good quality meats and seasonings provided alongside unlimited servings of other side dishes and rice bowls. For one person, I paid for dinner and it was $22 not including tip."}
{"text":"I was hoping to have another option for AYCE KBBQ since Hwaro is getting more and more popular, and although this place was a-ok as the 3 stars suggest, I'd probably rather wait at Hwaro to get my AYCE KBBQ fix. Quick rundown:  Pros: -Staff is super efficient and checks on you often -Steamed egg here is delicious, make sure to order it -Clean with large seating areas -I really liked that unlike other places, they didn't want to give you more meat than you could handle. We got very appropriate portions for 2 hungry, but not overwhelmingly hungry, diners. I didn't feel like I was being forced food I didn't want. Just explain to them what portion size you want of anything.    Cons: -We only enjoyed I would say 1 out of the 4 meats we ordered (the marinated bulgogi); everything else lacked flavor and was a bit tough -The vent gets in the way of you seeing your dining partners -A lot of banchan options, but the japchae was lacking in flavor and bean sprouts were noticeably absent -They give vegetable tempura, but it came cold with no real dedicated tempura sauce (the sauces for the meat don't really work)  The bathrooms all have a shared sink which are on the outside of the bathroom and viewable from the dining area, which I found a bit odd. I'm seeing this more and more at restaurants now. For bolder flavors, I'd go to Soyo up the street for non-AYCE."}
{"text":"I been to many all you can eat but this  place was amazing. Excellent customer service and good food. I recommend to everyone if you like Korean food."}
{"text":"This was my first experience at a Korean BBQ spot. I went with a girlfriend, we ordered a combo with brisket, pork belly and a couple other pork cuts that was more than enough food for the two of us. The server was awesome and could tell we didn't have a clue what we were doing so he pretty much did everything for us and it was definitely helpful! The food was great except for the fried rice at the end which is very bland. The barley tea they serve to everyone is great as well, but the cups they give you to drink out of look like something out of a hospital cafeteria."}
{"text":"So glad we found this AYCE BBQ. Price is great. They have dinner option 1 and 2 the different just a few dollars more if you want one more particular item that is not listed on dinner option 1. Service is attentive they even helped us do some of the grilling too. Definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place has been on my radar for a while now, especially since it is so close to where I live. Finally decided to check it out last night and I was wildly impressed!  (+) Service was top notch! All employees were incredibly nice and helpful! This was only our second time enjoying a Korean BBQ place and Judy really went out of her way to help us out!  (+) We tried several of the meats, but the steak and the short ribs certainly stood head and shoulders above the rest! Don't get me wrong though, the bulgogi, pork belly, and thinly sliced brisket was also tasty as well. (+) Sides were good too! My personal faves were the mac salad, kimchi, and salad (greens). (+) Prices were good. I had dinner II ($23.95) which included 1 steak (Yummy!), while my friend had dinner I ($19.95). I definitely feel like I enjoyed my moneys worth of good food! (+) Cozy, but clean and comfortable dining area with amusing K-Pop videos playing on the wall! lol  (-) That vent totally blocks you from seeing the other people at your table. Wish there was a better way of setting that up. (-) Shared sink outside the restrooms is visible from the dining area. Just an odd set up for that.  This was a very enjoyable experience and I will certainly be back to enjoy Doh Korean BBQ again! Highly recommended!  5 stars."}
{"text":"Update....09/03/3017 Better than the first time. All I have to say.  Food waaaaaas aaaaaaaawsoooome. Seriously. It was pretty good. Better than Lee's. Only thing I regret is I ate two bowls of thier Kimchi sides and as I sit in the ....... in a little pain round the rosey..... I say why did I do that. Answer...tasted great. Meats were well seasoned and cooked by staff to perfection when I didn't do it on my own...staff was always helpful I just like cooking the food myself sometimes. In the words on our next President (once the Constitution is changed) Arnold Swartzeneger..  \"I'll be back\". Suggest only a dabble of Kimchi next time........ahhhhhhhhhhhhhouuch."}
{"text":"The menu is a bit limited but the quality of the food was really good. Our server, Adrian, was awesome and made sure we didn't wait for anything. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Love all the yummy side dishes and the cuts of meat were good too. Loved the marinated kalbi and jap chae but the spicy salad seemed old. Minus a star for subpar service and we had to consistently ask for water and more side dishes."}
{"text":"I love coming to this place. The food is great but most of all the service is the best I've seen in town. I recommend the shrimp most of all."}
{"text":"This is the best local Korean BBQ on the southwest side of town. Love that this is in my neighborhood. My best friend was so sweet and knew I loved Korean BBQ so suggested that we try this new place even though he was a bit skeptical.  We ended up ordering the boneless short ribs, beef bulgogi, spicy pork bulgogi and steamed egg.  All was amazing and my friend loved it so much he's now a fan like me. Service was top notch and food was the same. I could eat this 24/7 . I'll. E back for my bday next week.  Thank you Doh for coming to our neighborhood and helping me to convert on friend at a time on being a lover of Korean cuisine."}
{"text":"Among all you can eat korean bbq places, the combination of price, quality, and service here is hard to beat. Yelp brought me here on new year's eve cuz I wanted to get korean bbq somewhere for under $25 where I didn't have to wait in line for 45 minutes (cuz of new years). Menu has everything you'd expect from a Korean BBQ place plus shrimp all for $20 (dinner price pre tax). I also liked the layout of the place. My pictures aren't great because I was concerned about looking like I was taking pictures of ppl eating but it's somehow small and roomy at the same time. They've got a good ventilation system for the grill smoke. The grill somehow makes it easy to grill. I've been to places where I feel like I'm straining to put and move around meat on the grill and this pave felt easy.  And they have a convenient, clean sink outside of the bathroom for just washing your hands before and after your meal do you don't have to think about handling the door knob when b you enter and exit the bathroom. I know 5 stars is high, but this place is pretty great for $20. My one ding is the chicken bulgogi. I guess everybody has their own style but I was expecting smaller pieces rather than large chicken chunks.   Additionally you can pay about $4 more for one serving of ribeye steak. I didn't try it so I don't have an opinion on it."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite spots. Excellent service! The food is delicious! & We never have any complaints when coming here. Even the salad and macaroni are amazing."}
{"text":"One of mine and my family's favorite Sunday spot. Usually come here for lunch. Super friendly staff! Their service is exceptional. There's always someone who comes around asking if we're doing ok or if we need something. Portions are bigger than most AYCE kbbq so make sure you come hungry!"}
{"text":"There's some pluses and minuses to this place. First, it's convenient and usually never busy, so it's an easy place to go whenever. But, there aren't a lot of variety of meats. There's only a few options for each category, and some options are blocked out for only dinner options, or if you pay extra. The appetizers sometimes change, but for the most part, they are okay. The service is fast, but there's nothing exceptional. It's just like they're there to get the job done and not so much there to make your experience better. I'm giving it 4 stars because of how local friendly the location is and it's an AYCE that gets the job done, but there's not much more to it."}
{"text":"Doh Korean BBQ is a great place to go when you're on a budget but really want that Korean BBQ fix. The selections are brief but they carry the basics--bulgogi, brisket, and what they call short ribs but it feels more like chuck pounded till tender. Nothing wrong with that since the meat is pretty tender. The banchan is great and they have stuff I don't normally see, like the clear noodles and mac salad. They also provide three dipping sauces, which is cool and very tasty.  The vent is low so the smoke smell isn't too bad when leaving.  Overall, a great stop when you just want clear cut Korean BBQ."}
{"text":"GREAT SERVICE!! Friendly staff and FOOD is ON POINT! I have been in a lot of Korean BBQ, and this place is very good. They change your grill plate when they see the it is burning. This is a great service and you can really experience the taste of their food, not the burnt  taste in your mouth.  This place is highly recommended."}
{"text":"Love that all the good places from China Town are opening up in the SW. Food was great and the service was as well. Max was our \"server\" idk what you'd call um lol. The decor inside is really nice. Went for lunch, so was a little disappointed I couldn't get the kalbi as its only a dinner item."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. But parties of 4 or more get charged an instant gratuity on the check. Just an FYI."}
{"text":"Honestly, I have been to many Korean bbq's in my life. The food at this location is very good, I'm not gonna lie. Everything is marinated properly, and the food tastes fantastic. But the service is not very good. The servers started out very nice but when you ask for more meats they get annoyed and frustrated and that's NOT how it should be at a Korean bbq. This place seriously enforces the time limit and I think that's a load of crap to enforce a time limit if it takes them like 10-15 minutes to bring out just one plate of meat. Isn't it funny how once they tell us that they are kicking us out, they suddenly become nicer again... Hmm..."}
{"text":"This place is a pretty good all you can eat Korean barbecue place. They take reservations which is nice if you have a big group of people. They also have a few big tables if you have a big party. They have a nice interior design which makes the experience even better. The tongue is good along with the short ribs. They had good customer service and were very friendly. Their bathrooms were clean. The only weird thing is that they have their sinks outside of the bathrooms so you have to wash your hands out in the open. Their mirrors are by the sink as well so you can also fix yourself or get the food out of your teeth in front of everyone, which feels a little strange. They have plenty of parking so that's not an issue and it is in a good area."}
{"text":"Loved this place! First they give you the little sides and an amazing salad to start...so good! The meat was had was all delish and the service was great! Get the steamed egg! All of the people we came into contact with were so nice and friendly. My toddler son was with us and the staff was not at all bothered by his presence. So I would say kid friendly. And it was a very hip and CLEAN atmosphere. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"I love tofu hut and this is closer to my side of town! The service was amazing. They refilled, cooked for us and always checked on us to make sure we are okay! All the meats were different but the pork shoulder was the bomb and recommended to us. Yum!   The only downside was the menu says for 6 they include gratuity but it was only 4 of us and they added gratuity. Otherwise it was good."}
{"text":"It's great to finally have an all you can Korean restaurant close to home (southwest). My family And I love it here it. It's really clean, service is great and the food is good. It's not the super traditional Korean food- but if you like meat... and lots of it. This is the perfect place."}
{"text":"TL;DR: very standard experience, reliable options, awkward fan  Doh KBBQ provides a very standard and popular Korean BBQ experience with good options and competitive prices. There wasn't too much that was beyond ordinary from this location, but nothing came close to disappointing as well. With nice table setups, friendly staff, and enough menu options, I would suggest this KBBQ for an affordable KBBQ experience.  Of course, a friend and I ordered the regular AYCE.  ALL YOU CAN EAT DINNER (4/5) - Not a huge number of options, but all you really need - High quality meats, especially brisket and bulgogi - Some meats felt chewy and fatty, filling me up quicker - Table felt a little cramped, even with only two people  One thing that felt a little odd to me was the table fan. The fan lowers down above the grill to an extremely low level. I felt that it sat in between my friend and I, which made conversation kind of awkward. It works because it sucks up all the fumes and you don't smell like food afterwards, but I did find it a bit odd. At the end of the meal, you're offered a free mochi ice cream, which was great!  There isn't much to be said about the standard KBBQ experience. If you're looking for that at a good price, Doh is the place you're looking for."}
{"text":"My roommates and I were SO EXCITED that a new Korean BBQ place was opening in our hood. Especially a sister restaurant to Tofu Hut, one of our regular spots for KBBQ. Unfortunately we had a terrible first experience here last week.   As soon as we walked in we were charmed by the cute interior. But five minutes later not ONE server acknowledged our existence at the door. They were avoiding any possible eye contact as they were scurrying around the restaurant. All I expected was a greeting of some sort upon entering the restaurant and maybe a hint of how long the wait is. There were no other customers waiting for a table and there were three empty tables available at the time.   I'm a reasonable person so I understand that the opening of a new restaurant is probably very stressful and hopefully they're trying to work out some kinks or training blah blah. So I waited patiently and was a relatively happy camper once the food started arriving. Once I was less hangry I started thinking of the positives like great banchan and romaine cabbage salad, tasty boneless short ribs, and solid rice lol. Things were going swell despite the obvious flirting between the older female waitresses and table of drunk gentlemen next to us (apparently the older waitress with the glasses IS SINGLE for all you lucky dogs, the other is married sorry).  At this point we had half plates of bulgogi, short ribs, and brisket on the table that we were still powering through. The \"single\" waitress with glasses came around to check on us so my bff stated \"I'd like to order something please\" to which the waitress briskly responds with \"YOU DIDN'T FINISH WHAT YOU HAVE AND WANT TO ORDER MORE?\"   What. The.   First of all, my bff just wanted a steamed egg. It's not like we were ordering extra helpings of meat. Second of all.. THIS IS ALL YOU CAN EAT. You don't know me.   You could tell she felt guilty for jumping to conclusions but there was no redemption after that point. They also forgot to bring us the last plate of beef tongue we ordered but by then we were over it.   Overall the meat was inconsistently marinated, edible but nothing to rave about. Banchan decent. Service was obviously lacking. I would gladly drive to a further location for a better experience."}
{"text":"Fuck this place! Please stay away as far as u can. All the food items are tasted like dog/animal foods. I fucking wasted my money. The rest of my life, I would never visit this place again. There are a lot of bad things that I wanted to say but I just leave as it is.... u know what's up..... The worst Korean food I ever ate..."}
{"text":"Love that this is close to home. Food is good. Service is great. The staff is really nice. Our server Jin was very sweet. My kids and hubby loved it here. Great place for family."}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant for dinner yesterday and the service was extremely slow. It was a full house and only one guy server that was helping us out. I came with family that were visiting from out of state, and it was very embarrassing to bring them to a restaurant and have us wait. The restaurant was highly understaffed considering how busy it was."}
{"text":"This place is not open until midnight, like they say. We came here and walked in at 10:55. We were told they stop taking guests at 11 by the girl at the little podium. I said, great it's 10:55. She said we were too late and I pointed at the \"OPEN\" sign that was still on. She then turned off the light and said she was sorry and the grills were already turned off. So really they're open until 11pm."}
{"text":"Sitting in a concrete booth... No, we weren't kidnapped.  Jo and Ness were just taking soju shots while waiting for cousins for a late dinner.  Late dinner?  ppptthhh ummm no such thing in Vegas.  Doh is a small restaurant in comparison to ones I've dined in before.  But I'm diggin' the brick and metal pipes look.  It helps keep it cool inside considering all  the grills going off.    The menu is as simple as chicken, beef, shrimp - marinated or non.  Side dishes spread out on table like normal.  We had like fifths on the noodles serving (I forget the name in Korean).  There are pickled onions and jalapenos I recommend with every bite of grilled whatever you toss in your mouth.  And also I suppose you're drinking healthy alcohol if you choose to get a bottle of Soju hahahaaa.  It literally says 100% pure mineral happy water (18% alcohol).  Yeah GO FOR IT!  You are grillin anyway; chill and grill.  Service was good.  They tried not to bother our dining but wanted to make sure we wanted anything else.  I think we ran out of water too quickly too often.  Sure I'd be back.  I'm also one of \"those people\" that would like to try other Korean BBQ restaurants, there being multiple in the area."}
{"text":"Tried something new and have been to Tofu Hut before. Same owners here and was really tasty. Great service and friendly staff! Went for the all you can eat lunch. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"This place was excellent, and very busy during dinner time. The service was great and so was the food. The staff was courteous and friendly. If you are into cooking and eating Korean food. This place is the place to eat, in Vegas."}
{"text":"Is it the greatest AYCE KBBQ I've ever had? Not exactly. However, it does the job for being so close to my house and not having to drive all the way to Chinatown (extra 7 min, but hey we're all spoiled in Vegas).   I had their brisket, red wine and regular pork belly, and marinated short ribs.  I wish they offered more side dishes. I also wish they had rice paper and brisket sauce.... then they'd be perfect! Price is very reasonable for AYCE and the atmosphere is pretty cool."}
{"text":"Just went to have dinner .. advertised closing at 12midnight, As we walked in they said they are already closed ?! Really ? It's 1115pm ..."}
{"text":"This Korean BBQ is sooooo bad! First, when we come in there, nobody service us until we stand more than 5 min! Second, the meat is not fresh, the taste so bad, too dry. The last, this BBQ is all you can eat,but I can't believe that soup need extra charge!"}
{"text":"OH yay...a new korean bbq place nearby!  I remember passing by this all the time, and I couldn't wait til it opened!    Walked inside, looks kind of like Hobak with the hoods suspended from the ceiling.  Clean, and staff were very attentive.  Price wasn't bad: $16.95 for lunch.  Small menu, but it's fine with me.    So the grill comes with a block of fat.  We requested oil to grease the grill, but they said no, and that's what the block of fat was for.  Ok, I'm not opposed to it.  Different experience for me.  I'm not used to getting no answers when I'm at a restaurant.  Why can't i get oil on my grill if it's my preference?  Also, my mother requested to only do a la carte while my father and I would do AYCE, and the server wouldn't allow it.  It was either we all did AYCE or a la carte.     For lunch, we got the marinated sliced ribeye (bulgogi), brisket, shrimp, and red wine pork belly.    Bulgogi, was good, but would be better if they included some onions and green onions with it, but only one AYCE korean bbq place in town does that.  Still a good marinade.  Nothing mind blowing, but still good flavor.    Shrimp was lightly marinated (if even), but I'm okay not having saucy fingers when trying to peel shell on shrimp at korean bbq.  Lightly seasoned, still great flavor.  I can only do red wine pork belly in these places.  The red wine is a great marinade, and makes all the difference in a well red wine marinated slab of pork belly.    Overall, this place is good place for korean bbq.  Not something that blew me off the water or I would crave, but still a good place for some good korean bbq."}
{"text":"First time here. I heard about this place through some searching through Yelp. This is a new Korean all you can eat Korean bbq. I would say their service is wonderful, their food selections such as the meats was okay, not a lot of options compared to other Korean bbq places I've dined in. I would rate their food and experience a 4 out of 5, nothing special about it just your typical Korean bbq place with a small atmosphere."}
{"text":"Been here a few times with my husband. Tonight we had excellent service, first time having the male waiter I can't remember his name but he was the only male server tonight. We had the usual brisket, tongue, pork shoulder, streamed egg, tempura veggies. I would recommend asking for a smaller portion of the pork shoulder for a small group. We have also tried the rib eye which was tender but I'm more of a thinly sliced meat lover for kbbq. Also nice having the vents come down so you don't leave smelling like BBQ"}
{"text":"first of all, shoutout to Ryan (our server) during our trip to EVO haha.  probably the best server I've ever had at a restaurant. so yeah, the service is good, and their all you can eat is great to be honest. For the prices you definitely do get a lot and everyone urges you on to eat as much as you can. Which honestly is great because the food is so good. Definitely a really fun place to go with friends, and probably one of the best kbbq locations I've ever been to!"}
{"text":"There aren't many options but the food and banchan are SO good! I'm so in love with the salad - best salad I've had at an AYCE Korean BBQ; so good that I even skipped the rice! What I really love too is the exhaust hood at the table - it does a great job at eliminating the smell from cooking. The brisket was my fave. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"If your get tired of casino buffet and want some change.   This place is good start.   All the meets were fresh and marinated perfectly.  It's delicious.  Only wish the soup was included in the price is bufffet."}
{"text":"If I could leave them 10 stars I would..  Great staff, different experience and excellent food! I was very surprised to see 16.99 on the bill  for all I ate .. I Will definitely go back and absolutely highly recommended !"}
{"text":"I came in today to have dinner with my parents. The food was okay but the service was terrible! Our server was a girl and we were having a hard time understanding what she was saying and it seemed like she was giving us attitude. She keeps forgetting the stuff that we are asking for. This is my first and last time that I'm going to eat here. Service sucks!"}
{"text":"Came here for a friends birthday about 15 of us. Quality was good but our server was super rude kept coming by and I felt like every time we ordered she had a attitude about it. They close at 12 we got there around 9:00 stayed till 10:00 they shut  off our vents while we were still cooking food and our waitress came up and asked if we were going to finish our food or they will charge us. Of course we would finish it with the group we had. I understand rules but don't be presumptuous about it. I rather go to Hobak or Gen."}
{"text":"As the current undisputed Duke of Doh, it's no surprise that I eat here A LOT...and for good reason. DOH IS THE F***ING BOMB WHEN IT COMES TO KOREAN BBQ!  If you're doing Doh, you're doing All You Can Eat (AYCE), there is no other way to do it: $16.95 for Lunch, $19.95 for Dinner I, and $23.95 for Dinner II (at the time of writing this review). That's INSANE for KBBQ prices!  The difference between Dinner I and II is that you have access to Rib Eye if you're willing to spend the extra $4. Do it!  The best meats you can order are the Brisket, the Signature Marinated Boneless Short Rib, and the Rib Eye. The Marinated Sliced Rib Eye Bulgogi is also good, but tastes almost exactly like the Marinated Short Rib, but with a texture reminiscent of barbacoa. In my opinion, the Marinated Short Rib is the best thing on the menu; it's sweet, delicious, and addictive, especially when you get the perfect amount of crisp on the exterior.   Included with every AYCE is a wide variety of side dishes (banchan), my favorites being the Glass Noodles (Jap Chae?) and the tempura vegetables for a nice contrast of textures to complement your meat selection. You also get rice included with your AYCE as well, but it doesn't come immediately, so make sure you ask!  The staff at Doh is always super friendly and helpful. They are very attentive to your grill temperature to make sure your food doesn't accidentally burn, and they're always making sure you have everything you need to have a good time...especially more food!  Overall, Doh is one of my favorite restaurants in the city, and I will continue to solidify my reign as Duke of Doh on Yelp for years to come. YOU NEED THIS IN YOUR LIFE! Grab some friends and head on down! They're also open super late! I promise you'll have one hell of a time and be craving Doh again the next day!"}
{"text":"From the same owners as Tofu Hut but a TOTALLY different experience. Don't get me wrong, TH is one of the best food bargains in town. But if you have wheels, spend an extra two bucks for AYCE and come to Doh! Clean, fresh, modern environment. Similar food to the Hut, different banchan here and there including a little tempura sampler, add shrimp and another item or two to the menu, more dipping sauces offered (ssamjang and some kind of tempura dip as well as the traditional oil/salt/pepper). But what left us astounded was the attentive, genuine service. Totally into making sure you are satisfied. The waitstaff will add their expertise and help you cook if they notice something needs turning or if you're unsure what to do. Our grill surface was changed twice! The last time we said it wasn't necessary but she said \"no, this is better for you. It's no problem!\" Well alright!! We've tried 5 Korean BBQ in town so far, you'll make a good deal if you choose Doh #1."}
{"text":"I'm probably in the minority when I say I haven't been to Tofu Hot before trying Doh Korean BBQ. I have, however, eaten at plenty of other Korean BBQ places in Vegas and California, and oh my gosh, this place is good.   Honestly, what made me fall in love with this place is its layout and seating options. The interior is very charming. Although there aren't a great deal of decorations, the decorations that are there make for a nice and laid back atmosphere. The restaurant has a maximum capacity of 99 people and has relatively spaced out seats for its customers. Aside from the standard tables in the middle of the room, there are three booths facing the middle of the room, so customers can watch the music videos projected on the wall while they sit in the booth and talk. Each booth can seat 6 or 7 people comfortably.   The technology here is obviously geared towards serving Korean BBQ. The vents are brand new and can be moved very close to the grill, making for less smoke than most other Korean BBQ places. It minimizes the distinct Korean BBQ smell that tends to linger in people's clothing long after they leave the restaurant, which is a definite plus.     My friends and I came here during lunch, when there were only two servers present, and our server was excellent: He answered any questions about the menu, checked on us on a regular basis, and was fast to fulfill any requests we had. It got busier towards 4 PM, but the server remained attentive throughout our eating experience.  We ordered briskets, porkbelly, and marinated bulgogi beef. I thought the salad was a little bit salty, but both of my friends loved it. The side dishes were plentiful and yummy. Overall, the food was good. Not \"wow-I've-never-had-meat-this-amazing-good,\" but good enough to be worth $17.99 (lunch) in my opinion.  On another note, I'm not sure what is up with dessert here. When I asked if they have dessert, the server told me they have mochi ice cream that just came in today, but they hadn't decided on the price yet, so he suggested we go to Gelatology in the same plaza for dessert. I guess Doh Korean BBQ hasn't figured out all menu items yet. Hopefully there'll be updates soon.     So far, Doh Korean BBQ is off to a very promising start. I'll be glad to make this another future go-to food joint in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Very good food! Just the sides alone will fill you up. Great servers. Clean place. Price is very reasonable. Their vents are great! You will not smell food when you walk out. :)"}
{"text":"ABOUT DAMN TIME WE GOT A KBBQ IN THE SOUTH WEST!!!! Walk in and the staff immediately greeted me and my friend even though the place was pretty busy. We had to sit down for a couple of minutes and while we were waiting Young \"our server\" handed us a menu to look over. Got seated and within a minute or so Young was already back with our side dishes and to help us with the menu. He gave us excellent recommendations and was very apologetic when I asked for sake because they do not have a liquor license yet. The meal went great, the food was amazing, service was on par. Young made the experience well worth it. So glad it's right next to my house, they will definitely be seeing me again. When you go, ask for Young."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Never been to an AYCE Korean BBQ place before. The service was beyond amazing. Ryan and the rest of the crew took such good care of us.   The food was also phenomenal. They are very accommodating and can make 1/4 or 1/2 orders with the meat. Each portion has a lot of meat so If you want to try something out before investing in a whole plate it helps to order a portion of it. The meat was fresh and flavorful. My favorite was the boneless beef ribs and squid. Great flavor! Also loved all the side dishes. The kimchi was delicious! There really wasn't a single thing that I didn't like about this place.   Great service, excellent food, good price, and nice decor! A+ all around. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Great food, Great service, And great ambience.... What else do you need? I am so happy that we have more choices when it comes to Koran BBQ and Doh's BBQ will be my first choice.  Two thumbs up from me."}
{"text":"This is my new spot for AYCE KBBQ. Sister company to Tofu Hut, and much closer to where I live. Plus it's really nice inside!"}
{"text":"My favorite Korean bbq place in town. Service is quick and the venue is modern. It gets pretty busy on the weekends, but I'm sure most restaurants do."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time last week because my friends and I decided that we should do something since we all haven't hung out in while. One of them suggested Korean BBQ but we didn't want to take the bus all the way to Tofu Hut. Then another one suggested this place since he found out that they opened up recently. Needless to say, we were ready to go. We came in and they seated us immediately. The hostess was kind and made sure that we had everything we needed. We ordered the beef rib-eye bulgolgi and OH MAN was it good. I couldn't stop eating it! We literally all fought each other with out chop sticks to get some. The waiters came by ever so often to help us refill our meat supply or change our grill. The Korean music videos that play are also very entertaining. It is indeed a little pricey when coming in with a larger group of people but I know I'll be coming here the next time I get the opportunity to."}
{"text":"The food/flavor was good but the menu/meat choice is def smaller compared to other similar eateries. The service was good. The decor is cool but the booths are a little tight. Also, their bathrooms don't have sinks. There's a common area that you have to use which is visible to everyone in the restaurant. I mean, I guess you can see who doesn't wash their hands which I suppose can be a pro but I thought it was kinda weird."}
{"text":"This was far from us but had to try it since we love Tofu Hut and was excited since the place was new and they're second branch. Nice set up, vent was nice cuz it was lower and we dont cook with smoke all over our face. It was clean, modern and more spacious. The salad was the same and bomb as ever. We had 2 extra dipping sauce here aside from the standard oil, salt and pepper. The server didn't explain what they were for but when we asked they explained it well. Our Lady server was a bit stingy on giving us what we ask for like she was worried we can't finish it. The male server was good and provided us more than she gives us. The side dishes wasnt as good as what the original Tofu Hut has though. Glad we tried it."}
{"text":"My third favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. Value for the money, very nice ambience, attentive staff. Cannot ask for more."}
{"text":"After my friend posted on his social media that he went here & said it was better than Tofu Hut, my boyfriend and I had to try it. For starters, lunch is $16.95, Dinner I is $19.95, and Dinner II is $23.95.  I really liked the environment and the layout of the place. The thing that I thought was really cool was the vent system there - it's not your typical KBBQ place where there's a huge hood thing on top of your grill. The food was pretty decent. We ended up really liking the marinated sliced rib eye. But honestly, I didn't think the price was worth it for the food. At the end of our meal, we were definitely full, just not satisfied with how much we paid and the food. If we had gone to Gen, we would've spent less money for more food and everything. Not sure if I'd want to come back but it was definitely a different experience."}
{"text":"My experience here was amazing! Our waiter Young was a really fun, charismatic gent! He made us all laugh and brought out some really good meat. I recommend the black porkbelly and the pork shoulder! Great time, fantastic service and delicious food! Will be back :)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I go to Doh every week and we absolutely love it! Love the side dishes, and the meat quality is good! The service is always perfect and quick and there are enough seats in the restaurant so that we have rarely had to wait. We love Doh!"}
{"text":"Love the price and quality of meat here. The service is always fast, friendly, and consistent for every visit. As with most kbbq places my son, 9 y/o is full price. The restaurant is spacious and clean. Would definitely return and is our go-to for kbbq in the SW area."}
{"text":"I can't even give them one star but I have to. Shittiest service ever. Only think about saving tables. Wtf, I have a party of 6 and they want to squeeze us on a table of 5, with another family. They had another table open that could fit my family comfortably but no we couldn't sit on it because we need to share. Really what about the other table. I really don't get it. Give good customer service if your gna take this as a career. Don't be a stuck up lady. So rude!!!! My family so disgusted on how we were treated we left although we like the food here and its close to our house. We'll make the drive to Korean garden for their better service."}
{"text":"First time I've ever had Korean BBQ and this place does it right. The atmosphere is so fun and it kind almost feels like your camping. They give you a ton of sides to choose from and all you can eat is only $20...so worth it! Try them out"}
{"text":"Like many others, I was super excited to try this place since it's close to home and there aren't any kbbq (that I know of) by me except for Chinatown.   Came in and it was super dead. Had a party of 3 and only 2 of us wanted AYCE since our third person was going to a party soon but wanted to hang out and maybe grab just a drink. Told our waiter this and she said they would have to charge him extra for sitting at the same table as us. I guess that's understandable since they don't want to risk people trying to sneak freebies. Anywho, we ordered brisket, spicy chicken bulgogi, beef tongue and steamed egg.  Service was fast since it was just us and another table. However, they brought out the chicken and brisket along with this oil thing? I thought it was a piece of lard or something. She just set it in the middle of the stove and left...I wasn't sure if we were supposed to touch it cuz she didn't really say anything. So I just went about placing the chicken on the stove then she comes back and says \"Awww I was going to start the brisket first since it cooks fast\" Oops. But how was I supposed to know when you didn't explain anything? I thought she was just gonna hand the meat over and let us do our thang!?! Well the chicken took freaking forever to cook because the waiter kept coming and turning our heat high and low which was just a little annoying cuz it took forever for the brisket to cook (& yall know it don't take that long for brisket to cook!). I appreciate that she and other staff members kept checking up on us but I just wish they would let us cook our meat lol. Me and my friend like our brisket kind of charred and they kept coming and stirred everything up and mixed it in with the tongue (I don't like tongue) so I was kind of like ehhhh. I think it's because they weren't busy so maybe they were bored.  Anyways, the brisket was good. I love any brisket. I could eat just brisket at any kbbq. The spicy chicken was more on the salty side though. & be careful cuz that salad is freaking addicting lol. Steamed egg was okay too. I do wish they gave more side dishes. The macaroni looked stale and crusty.  Overall service is 4.5/5. Again I dunno maybe I was just hangry but I like being independent when it comes to kbbq. I don't like when people meddle when I cook my brisket. Maybe I'm just used to other kbbq place leaving you alone. They did check up on us many times to refill water and salad so that was good. Food I give 3/5, the chicken could have been better. I will probably return since it's so close to my house and to try other menu items :)"}
{"text":"I love this place - I live in the northwest and I drive all the way to this place. I like it that much."}
{"text":"This place is a definite must for anyone in Vegas and craving some Korean BBQ. The service is astounding. Every 10 minutes, a server would always be there to check up on how we were doing. The side dishes were free and there was a wide variety of them. Dinner is only 20 dollars per person which is awesome for AYCE Korean bbq. The portion sizes for the meat is very very generous. The marinade for the meats were delicious !! The inside look of the restaurant is great, good character making the dining experience even better. If your looking for good quality Korean BBQ without having to break the bank, definitely come here"}
{"text":"First time eating here. It was really good! Love the cook your own style because you can decide how long you want your food to be cooked. We did the AYCE (all you can eat) It comes with a bunch of complimentary sides such as a huge bowl of salad, cold noodles, picked onions, Kim chee, vegetable tempura, inari wraps, cold seaweed amongst other items. Not too sure if they were refillable but one of our servers (everyone helps everyone) offered us more Kim chee which was a plus because we love Kim chee. There's also three dipping sauces you can choose from. There's two tongs for cooking & a scissors for cutting the meats if they're too big. The service was good, attentive & even gave their advice on which soju was good. Everything we asked for we got it in a prompt manner. Would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I found my NEW go to AYCE KBBQ. Seriously, I'll travel all the way here to eat some good KBBQ. Their sister restaurant is Tofu Hut. I had Tofu Hut and is closer to home, but I rather travel all the way to the Southwest side of town.  You'll know why after you try some Doh. Every meaty morsel and the squid... mmm mmm the squid so soft and tasty. And who can forget about their red wine pork belly. YUMMMMM... also, their steam egg and banchans all so flavorful. I might have to visit soon. Lol maybe mothers day. Hopefully, it will not be too busy."}
{"text":"I've been to the Doh AYCE on Spring Mountain and they have a large menu with plenty of choices.   It was my first time here at DOH AYCE KBBQ. Prices are decent. I believe the AYCE Dinner Premium is $25/person. The menu is simple. I got the tongue, marinated bulgogi, short ribs, pork shoulder and belly. All delicious and went well with the 3 complimentary dipping sauces.   Tip: If you're eating with just one other person, I recommend ordering \"small portions\" - that way you can try everything on the menu.   The server was fast and attentive. Wasn't too busy on a Saturday night. Anyway a, great food for a great price."}
{"text":"Great place for FOOD and the overall atmosphere was great.   We were seated in the middle \"bench\" section and sitting there for a while is not comfortable, what so ever. Literally just a wooden bench with a little area underneath the seat for your purse. We couldn't really get up after our meal because our bums were so sore.   All the servers seemed to have been running around to absolutely every table so I wasn't too sure who was our actual server. If you like to drink a lot of water, the water cups were pretty tiny and they offered each table a decent sized container to constantly refill your own cup with.  Of course, the food is great because YOU are cooking it yourself. Just make sure you don't order too much because you have to pay for the pieces that weren't finished. The servers constantly refilled the sides which was fabulous.   Gratuity is already factored into the check so remember that!"}
{"text":"This place is good! Its cheap compared to most kbbq in vegas. The only thing i wish they have unlimited is the tofu bean soup:( Other than that this place is worth to check out! :)"}
{"text":"I was getting really tired of Gen and I have been looking for different Kbbq restaurants to try. I would definitely put this on the list!  Something different about this place is they put fat on the grill to spread around so that it sticks a little less, which is a huge plus!   I had to deduct a star because when I sat down there was just random brisket chilling on the table, but the restaurant wasn't busy so I'm not sure why they didn't check if it was thoroughly cleaned.   The selection here is pretty basic, but sometimes less is more. I kind of wish they had a little more appetizers we can pick from, but maybe I've just been spoiled with other places. I usually am not a fan of brisket because it just tastes basic with nothing going on, but I loved the brisket here! I ate so much brisket! When I came they were out of pork shoulder, it was only disappointing because their selection is pretty small so I was hoping they'd be fully stocked with everything.  One huge plus was that they off you mochi ice cream. You never see that at Kbbq places!  I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Great food and great service for a reasonable price. The tongue is BOMB. I enjoy everything on the menu. My only gripe is that the menu is somewhat limited compared to some other places, but not by too much. We'll see if they eventually add more options, which I wouldn't mind paying a bit extra for. Definitely a must try for those who are in the southwest area. It's conveniently located and even has a great dessert place next door."}
{"text":"First time here & I was not very impressed. Everything was kinda just ok. I'm a big fan of ayce kbbq so I like to check out different places. This place has way less items to choose from than the other places I've been too. The servers were nice though. Just wish they had more on the menu , like appetizers or something. Hwaro cost bout the same & has waaaaaay more on their menu."}
{"text":"Amazing experience this afternoon.  I really enjoyed the ambience and atmosphere here at Doh Korean BBQ during a business luncheon this afternoon.  Cool new concept on how to enjoy your food while it's cooked right in front of you.  We ordered Pork Belly, Brisket and Beef Bulgogi.  They cook it right to perfection in front of you and it was amazing.  The sauces to accompany it really give the nice kick afterwards.  They served water in a nice gallon jug and leave it at the table.  Place was immaculately clean and left me craving more.  I also really enjoyed the starter salad it came with for our $16.95 per person all you can eat lunch.  Really great staff and food for the price you pay.  Bravo!  Bookmarked as one of my favorites."}
{"text":"Wonderful place great service and fresh selection !! Great first impression ;) of this Korean AYCE place!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! To be honest I'd chose only 3 items for now until you eat it all then you can order more. I didn't finish a few and kinda regret it what a waste! But let me tell you the meat was sooooooooo well marinated it was so good! Love it! This is my 4th time here and nothing disappoints me at this restaurant!   Free mochi ice cream at the end! Nothing beats strawberry! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Worst service and staff ever.  When I asked for the manager they directed me to the bathroom. I thought it odd that our waitress didnt take 2 seconds to explain menu or how the place worked when I immediately mentioned it was our first time there.  Then we dared ask for extra tongs and got a long pause and stare before we got one.  My husband never got his iced tea...the one she explained came unsweetened.  Oh and everytime  we needed something we had to flag someone because waitress was more interested in chatting with staff and eating her own food.    So,I out found out manager was out of town.  I proceeded to give my complaints to the apologetic young girl.  I was given excuses such as they were short staffed and they were recovering from an earlier rush.  I counted 3 other parties so the place was not even 1/4 full.  When our waitress found out we complained she was confused why we were upset although clearly she knew what she was doing.  She then excused it by saying she was so tired all the while ending each comment with mocking and dismissive giggles and smiling.  I then had to pay an $80 Bill with much disgust and I left a $1 tip.  I also told them I would be sure to never come back and I'd go out of my way to discourage others. Too many restaurants in the valley struggling who have good food and great service.  I'd rather go to those places and pay $80 plus 20% tip for a good dining experience.  Oh and did I mention this was my birthday dinner.  I'll never forget this birthday!"}
{"text":"We got to the restaurant at about 6pm on a Friday night and were seated right away. No wait and not needing to drive to chinatown for AYCE Korean bbq is a huge plus! We opted for dinner I which includes all meats and sides with the exception of the ribeye. My favorite to eat in places like this is the beef brisket anyway. Right off the bat, service was fast and friendly. The servers frequently checked up on us, filled our sides/meats/drinks, and even assisted in the grilling of our meats. The quality of food is great!  The restaurant was clean with a contemporary design. The portions of each servings weren't too large either so even the most modest eaters with an eyeful of appetite wouldn't find it overwhelming. Overall, a great dining experience. Highly recommend this new chic AYCE Korean bbq on the southwest part of town"}
{"text":"Love that this place is open late. In this area, there are not much restaurants open other than fast food and who wants to drive all the way to china town? Not I. Lol.  Place is clean. Not much of a wait. The food was really good but they don't have much of a variety. Other than that, great place!"}
{"text":"Great Korean BBQ for the price and service. I live a few minutes away and this place is my go to restaurant for all you can eat. Food tasted great and the staff was very friendly. If you're eating dinner here, there's also a gelato shop and a cafe next-door for desserts!"}
{"text":"Cleaner tofu hut but outside of Chinatown.  The place isn't bad and if I need to get my AYCE Korean BBQ fix and don't feel like driving to Chinatown I would come here.  The fat they put on the grill is to help grease up the grill.  If you ever have trouble finding this place, just look for the delicious Gelatology.    If you come here with a party, the fan in the middle of the table might be in the way for you to talk/see each other.  But the spot isn't bad, I rather prefer tofu hut on Spring Mountain, the meats there taste better.  This spot felt like it was over marinated.  The briskets were good though, you can never go wrong with briskets.  Come try this spot out."}
{"text":"Gotta love AYCE KBBQ. This restaurant is right next to my parents' house in Vegas and it is UHMAZING! The food is really affordable, the side dishes (banchan) are tasty and clean, and there is a solid number of them, unlike some of the other neighboring AYCE spots. The lettuce and side sauces for the meat are plenty, as well as the rice. You get your choice of a side of stew and you also get steamed egg! I'm a huge fan!"}
{"text":"First time here and service was great! The restaurant is very clean- Food is yummy. Not sure if I saw spicy pork on their menu. Ordered pork belly, brisket, kalbi (its boneless- not what I wanted but it still tasted good)."}
{"text":"I visited on a Saturday afternoon at 1:30 PM with a party of 13 = 10 adults + 3 kids.  We were all hungry af as we just unloaded an extra long Uhaul truck of boxes and furniture.  We needed some AYCE Korean mf BBQ to recover, Doh!!! =)  Service: 4.0/5.0 Our party of 13 was seated in under 10 minutes over 3 separate grills.  As soon as we sat down, they took our drink orders, asked who was doing AYCE and we were off and running.  The usual banchan/side dishes were already at the table.They replaced the side dishes quickly after each request and kept the water jugs filled.  We had 3 grill changes and all were done quickly to keep us eating. Above average service for a busy korean bbq place overall.  Food: 4.0/5.0 Very simple menu made the ordering easy. The usual side dishes Japchae, kimchi, kkadugi, Eomuk bokkeum, etc. were all fresh and tasty.  The big bowl of salad was very fresh and the steamed egg was good.  For the grill, we went with the 1) Thinly Sliced Brisket 2) Marinated Sliced Rib Eye Bulgogi and 3) Squid.  The Brisket had no fat and was tasty and the Bulgogi was fine.  I've never had this much squid come out in a plate in one order.  Awesome!    Value: 4.0/5.0 $16.95 for our AYCE lunch was a great value and would still be a good value at their Dinner I price at $19.95, the max price of Dinner II at $23.95 (same as I with one serving of prime rib-eye per person) is the ceiling of how much I'd pay for the experience here.  Kids 4 and up are half price and it applied to us. I don't know the age when full price kicks in.    Ambiance: 4.5/5.0 Great brick walled, Industrial, steam punk kind of vibe going on.  The fan in the middle did a great job of keeping the smell of the grill off our clothes. There's a clock faced projected on the wall and they were playing K-Pop videos when we were there.  I totally appreciated that.  The storage areas underneath your bench were simple but such a design win!  It keeps the benches and/or tables free of purses, backpacks, fanny packs, etc.  Summary:  Next time I'm visiting friends on this side of town (southwest) and we want good Korean BBQ WITHOUT traveling to Chinatown. DOH! is now our go to place. I would definitely consider this place for a casual date night, as the place has a pulse but it's not too loud where you can't carry a conversation.  Definitely a great place for groups and our group left full and ready for a long afternoon nap. =)  Enjoy...!"}
{"text":"With one of the newest AYCE Korean BBQ places just a hop, skip, and a jump away from my favorite gelato shop, I knew I'd be trying this place out sooner or later. It ended up being more of a \"later.\"  Originally advertised as Tofu Hut, the restaurant group behind this place and several others decided to brand it as Doh Korean BBQ for their opening. It certainly looked clean and inviting inside when I first wandered in to check out the decor and the menu. I took my time getting around though, but I finally cajoled a friend into joining me at lunchtime today.  The menu items are prices in the double digits, so you might as well go for all you can eat. The AYCE offerings are lunch ($16.95, only available until 3:00 pm), dinner I ($19.95, including marinated boneless short rib), and dinner II ($23.95, including one-per-person rib eye). I wanted to get a chance to try all of the options, so I chose dinner II even though I could've stuck to lunch pricing.  Ventilation is from a quiet vertically adjustable fan that could get in the way of eye contact. They changed the grill plates quickly and provided good and timely service, contrary to some anecdotes that I've heard. Perhaps we were was lucky, or perhaps service has improved.  They brought out the rib eye for me first. It's a huge piece of meat and it's a little unwieldy to cook evenly on the grill because of uneven heating. It was tasty beef, but I didn't find it enticing enough such that I would order it again.  My companion had ordered the beef brisket in the mean time, and it was about as good as any other AYCE KBBQ brisket. It was a good portion for one or two people.  I had the marinated boneless short rib next at around the same time as my friend ordered the marinated sliced rib eye bulgogi. They were both pretty decent, but I was surprised that my short rib seemed to fall apart a little too readily. I don't mean in the tender way either. Having tried the dinner I/II options, I'd say that lunch would be sufficient if you can arrive before 3pm.  Sliced black (pork) belly and beef tongue were the final options. The pork belly was good, but didn't stand out. The beef tongue plate held a massive portion that would have been sufficient for four people, and the tongue was so sliced so thin that it cooked in seconds.  I was more impressed with the sides and condiments than the meats. The banchan included delicious crunchy kimchi, really delicious macaroni salad with corn and raisins, pickled radish, onion, and a late addition of ddukbokki that was more pleasant to chew at a well-known nearby restaurant. For dipping the meats, there are a nice salt and pepper oil and a fermented bean paste, both of which work in modest amounts. The sliced jalapeño and sliced garlic were very modest, and I mostly ignored them. The side salad with somewhat sweet dressing was standard fare. The steamed egg bowl was fluffy and delicious. Skip the vegetable tempura though. It was a strange mix of thinly sliced or julienned veggies and a ton of breading.  In a hypothetical world where there isn't awesome gelato in the same plaza, I wouldn't go across town solely for Doh Korean BBQ. But I can't say that I didn't enjoy my meal (and it's hard for me to give fewer than 4 stars to a limitless meat smorgasbord). It's a good neighborhood option if you want endless meat and don't mind the quality and variety reduction compared to the \"barstaurant\" just down the street."}
{"text":"First time here to eat and it was cold asin the dining room. I don't know if their heat wasn't working because one of their severs was wearing a coat, or they use an old trick McDonald's use to use to get you to hurry up and eat and leave lol cuz that's what we did and it's too bad because that may be what keeps me from going back.  That being said I will admit the service and the food is fantastic"}
{"text":"In comparison to East Coast KBBQ, it wasn't as filling as I thought it would be. The menu was very limited for all you can eat and had 2 prices for \"dinner all you can eat\" which are $20 and $24. The extra $4 difference is a one time service for a boneless ribeye steak.  It had the barley tea, water, and seasonings all well and good, but this kbbq is very limited, but overall filling!"}
{"text":"Awesome ayce kbbq place! The atmosphere was really chill and the place was beautifully decorated. From the moment we walked in, the servers and host attended to us. They always remembered our orders and We never had to ask for anything twice and that's very rare for an ayce kbbq place.  I was very impressed with their meat quality especially. The brisket was very thin cut, which I love, and had just the right amount of fat on them. Beef tongue was awesome too! I dont think i ordered any meat that I didn't Like! All the sides were good but the only thing I wished they fixed was the steamed egg. It was really watery towards the end. Also, they didn't have any rice paper /:   I recommend coming here with a big group of people because they give very big portions of meat. We were given complimentary mochi ice cream at the end too! This place deserved 5 stars, they're doing quality kbbq right!"}
{"text":"Good Korean BBQ. The meats were all very flavorful and the ban chan side dishes were great, especially the salad. Japchae given as a side dish and making it all you can eat was a pleasant surprise. Only disappointment was when it came to the bill. We were a party of 4 and an 18% tip was added. Usually tips are automatically added with groups of 8 or more."}
{"text":"First time at DOH, front waiter was extremely nice and helpful, back waiter(female) was a typical Korean rude , charged my son and I , 2 people 18 % tip on check. Never EVER have I seen this!! Added to our total!! We will NEVER go back!! Hope you enjoy your tip RUDE Korean lady! And your yelp review"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and really good cuts of meat! I love when they cook the meat for me, but my friend prefers doing it himself lol. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"All you can eat Korean BBQ? What else can you ask for. This location is too small for how popular it is, but it's still pretty good. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Right when you walk in, there is a first thought to yourself. Is this really a Korean BBQ restaurant? The inside is interesting but it gives off a hipster vibe. The decorations don't really fit your traditional decorations. I think they don't need the projector on the wall since you can't even see anything.   Location is not too bad. I'm not from Vegas so not too sure how much traffics and attention they get there. It seemed pretty far from the strip. It's not in a busy plaza either. And the restaurant itself is not that big.  There was three larger tables, three small tables and some booths.   Staff was awesome! I give them five stars for the amount of people they had to serve. One point the place got so busy that all the tables were full. Only two servers handling the entire place. Hands down to them.   Food was alright. Not too many selections on meat but the game changer was the marinate and seasoning for each meat. Most kbbq places have a whole menu side dedicated to choice of meat, not here. Only four sides given and salad and noodles. Rice costs extra."}
{"text":"Rude! We came in hostess acknowledged us and asked us for how many. We said two and she assured us a table was finishing up and we were next. I even asked if I needed to sign in. She told us no. I leave my husband for two minutes to use the restroom and come back to find she have two tables away! She assume we were with another party...how could we be with another party when we said we were a party of two!  What even frustrates me even more is that the hostess didn't apologize or made sure the next table was ours. Never coming back because of the customer service"}
{"text":"An AYCE kbbq place with good air conditioning unlike GEN . This place has great servers always making sure we had everything we needed from filling our ice water to changing the grills often and  making sure we had an abundance of meat and banchans. My fav was the beef short rib and brisket . Kids are half price ."}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to try Doh for my birthday since it's so close to where we live. I noticed how small it was compared to other Korean BBQ restaurants but you can tell this place is clean. And the decor is very cute and modern.  First I noticed how minimal the selection was but thought for the cost and convenience, it must be fine since how busy it was. I went straight to ordering because I know what I like and hate waiting for food to arrive late. What set me off was our waitress feeling the need to stop me in mid sentence of ordering and lecture me about how I shouldn't order so much. I was just about to order a 4th item and I just jokingly said that we are sure and are hungry. She went on to explain about how she had a previous group who over ordered, then argued with her about the waste charge on the bill. I totally get it. But there are different ways to address this issue by kindly advising that their plate sizes of meat is on a larger scale than other restaurants. Just because it happened to you once, does not mean every person will fall victim to this scenario. Eventually we got over this awkward moment and she finally let us finish our order.  Honestly, I was not a fan of any of the meats. I like to cook my meat between a medium rare just to a slight pink and somehow it was dry and chewy here. The sauces were good but could only help so much. The japchae was way overpowered with soy sauce as well. The only thing enjoyable here was the steamed egg, salad and I liked how the mochi ice cream came in their own packets.  I would rather drive another 15 minutes for any other Korean BBQ and not get lectured on my eating habits."}
{"text":"I came here around 2:00PM PST with my friend and we were quickly seated at our table. I personally did not like the grill hood being so close to the grill/table, as it blocked my view of my friend. If you sit to the left or right sides however, you won't have that issue.   We ordered brisket, beef bulgogi and spicy pork bulgogi. All three items were good and AYCE comes with salt/pepper/oil and other flavor enhancers for you meat. The salad was not too spicy, nor over dressed and was a perfect pairing with all of the meats.   One thing I don't like about KBBQ restaurants is that it feels like after you sit and order the initial round, your waiter/waitress doesn't check on you frequently. I'm not saying they have to come by every 10 minutes, but in general I felt they weren't at our table that much. However this could be a personal problem.   Overall, for the price and quality of the meats, I will definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"Had dinner here for my first time a few hours ago and it was delicious! I'm not very big on Korean BBQ but this place really made me change my perspective.   The location was a hole in the wall. Small restaurant. When we arrived it was pretty packed. I'm thinking we arrived during the busy time, but we were seated fairly quickly. The service was great. The food was absolutely delicious. We ordered the steak, brisket, cows tongue, and bogolgi. Everything was so tasty!   The price was reasonable. The experience was fun too. I definitely recommend and we will be sure to be back!"}
{"text":"I am happy that my friend took me here for Korean BBQ last night. I don't have to go to Chinatown anymore because this location is 15 minutes away from my house! The restaurant is small but with a good vibe. Everyone is happy in a KBBQ joint, right? There is a Korean movie playing in the background, which is kind of hipster cool. The menu is easy enough: AYCE 2 options (pay more if you get rib eye). My friend and I liked the brisket and marinated bulgogi. The dipping sauces enhanced the flavors of the meat. I like mixing the sesame oil with salt and pepper with the brisket sauce. My friend preferred the bean paste sauce. The banchan included japchae, seaweed, kimchee, fish cake, a terrific salad (the dressing is killer!), tempura, and rice.  With soju and tip, I paid $30, which I found completely reasonable. The best thing was the ventilation system. While it makes for difficult conversation, as it is literally right in front of your faces, it ensures that you will not smell like all the delicious meats you are cooking. The servers are very attentive, helping my friend and I cook (not burn) all of our food! Hahaha! There are several add-ons you can try, like steamed eggs or soups but we were both too full to try. You can also add ice cream mochi for dessert. Hidden gem in Smith's shopping center. Will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"I took my family here for my daughter's 18th birthday and we loved it!.. We had the eat-all-you-can for $19.99 and everyone enjoyed.  The servers were very friendly and helpful.  The meat marination is tasty.  We are diffinitely coming back! I only wish that they would lower the kids price ages 5-12yrs to at least a half price for kids at this age doesn't really eat that much. (Like my kids) More power to DOH! :)"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and it's always amazing. The waitresses are very attentive and will help cook the meat if you want them too. If your here for dinner, get dinner II as the Rib eye prime is worth the extra bit of money. A++ and I will be back again!"}
{"text":"ATTENTIVE SERVICE ... Tasty, fresh and massive quantity when ordering All u can eat lunch special   Great value... clean and pleasant with unique decor."}
{"text":"The only KBBQ place I've been to that doesn't leave us smelling like a campfire! The inside is very clean and modern. Great portions of meat for the price, and servers are very attentive. This is definitely on my favorites list!"}
{"text":"AWESOME place to eat!  Service is amazing. Staff is super courteous, attentive and friendly. Love the exposed \"brick walls\". Decently priced and unlike other AYCE joints not everyone in your party isn't required to get the same AYCE dinner in order to share. I love that there's a great AYCE Korean BBQ place in the southwest (about 10min drive from the Southern Highlands area). Menu is simple but meats are well marinated. Macaroni salad is served instead of potato salad and there was no pickled radish (daikon). This bummed me out a bit but, the caliber of other menu items and service made up for it.  You can also do half orders of the menu items. Which lets you to taste more of the menu items to figure out your favs!  I recommend the sweet and spicy pork and the beef bulgogi - both are very flavorful. FYI - you will get charged 18% gratuity for a party or 4 more but, they work for it so it's worth it.  I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Doh is one of the only places where I will go for KBBQ the atmosphere is great. Their food is amazing and I get more than what you would expect for the price and it is definitely my go to place with my family. It can get very busy and it seemed like they are understaffed but they try their best to attend to you as fast as possible."}
{"text":"We came here after work on a Friday around 530pm. There were 12 of us and the place just started getting busy.   There were two dinner choices. Dinner 1 was ayce with the exception of ribeye.  We decided to go with dinner one:  Started with two orders of brisket, bugogi, red wine marinated bacon, and short ribs just for the four of us since we got 3 grills. We also ordered 4 steam eggs, rice, and endless amount fof pickled kimchi.    We ordered the same amount of meat on round 2.  We thought about round 3, but opted out and went for the mochi ice cream instead.  Oh the meat were perfect and they were cooked to perfection by the chef...ME."}
{"text":"Love this place, food is great, everyone that works there is super nice, especially our server Derek. I found this place on yelp and thought I'd try it out, when we pulled up we was kinda of sketchy because it was in a not so nice neighborhood but we went in and the rest is history, we fell in love with the place."}
{"text":"I thought the food was great.  The bulgogi was very flavorful.   The brisket lacked some flavor but the sauces complemented it.   The salads were great and the service was excellent.  There was an all you can eat for lunch for $17 and it was worth it.   Will return."}
{"text":"I enjoy Doh!  AYCE KBBQ that's not in Chinatown. Located Southwest on Rainbow in between Windmill and Robindale.   - $16.95 for lunch menu  - $19.95 for dinner option 1  - $23.95 for dinner option 2 (only difference from option 1 is prime ribeye - 1 order per person)   Reasons why I would recommend Doh: - Clean, open, and well ventilated - Attentive servers (Hannah is super friendly!) - Prime ribeye steak melts in your mouth  - Well seasoned beef and pork  - Salad is on point - Not a huge selection of banchan (side dishes) but the ones they provide are consistently well seasoned   Playing devil's advocate I can see why this AYCE spot might not be everyone's favorite. Brisket can be hit or miss - either super tender or a little chewy.  Pricing is a little high for the number of menu options to choose from. Hwaro's pricing went up but it's still less than the dinner option 2 here and has like quadrupole the number of menu items...   I've enjoyed my few experiences here and have had great service (replenish banchan frequently and always coming by to check if we need more meat) which is why overall I'm giving Doh a 4/5. I honestly am their biggest advocate of the prime ribeye... So tender and delicious!!"}
{"text":"Very good prompt service. Refilled all sides and checked on us frequently.   Grill was changed on a regular interval.  Overall one of the best in town.  The salad is by far he best of any KBBQ in Vegas."}
{"text":"Came in for dinner Friday night because some of my friends wanted to eat kbbq. We chose Doh because it's really close to home compared to driving to Spring Mountain.  Perks is that the food is decent $20 AYCE dinner one and $24 for the dinner 2 which included one order of Ribeye Prime.  Cons is that the service was pretty slow. We got sat and than they dropped utensils and plates. Our server than left without asking what we wanted to drink. There were 3 servers 2 females and 1 male and they looked like they were struggling to keep up with the volume of customers coming in. There were a lot of yelling going on each time a server walked in to the back. The service here is poor only good thing is the food"}
{"text":"Great service, friendly and food was delicious!  The salad dressing was also tasty!!!  I normally go to china town area but this was closer so we thought we would try it out.  Very pleased and We will be back!"}
{"text":"Located on rainbow in the southwest, I was very happy to find this place. Since I usually have to drive to spring mountain to get my Korean bbq fix.  We opted for the AYCE dinner I. We ordered brisket and 2 kinds of pork belly. The brisket was good and cooked fast which was good because I was starving. They gave us a lot of side dishes and their Kim chi was actually spicy. I liked their salad, it had a lot of flavor. The black pork belly was very good and they give thick cuts. Everything was good and service was very nice. My only thing is I wish they had more choices as far as meat selection. Also included dessert with the AYCE. I may try the dinner II just to try the rib eye."}
{"text":"The decor was nice and staff was very friendly. Limited  meat choices , we paid for the extra ribeye steaks.  The banchan was simple but good. For parties of 4 or more you are charged an automatic gratuity. Quality of meat was fresh."}
{"text":"Went last week and thought the place was great.  Very clean, food was great, kimchi was very good and the salad....awesome.  The staff was friendly and helpful and they made great recommendations.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Forget Tofu Hut!! Try Doh Korean BBQ!! I use to be a fan of Tofu Hut when I first moved to Vegas but, have stopped going completely for about 4 years now. Especially since they have been featured on \" Dirty Dinning\" twice on the news...yuk!! Tofu Hut has gone down hill as time went by. Dirty, bad service and the quality of the meats has been very \"questionable\" in regards to freshness.  How I missed eating at Tofu Hut when it was all good & clean.  Doh Korean BBQ will be my Tofu Hut replacement. Clean (very clean) modern, great friendly service, and very good food with fresh quality meats and ingredients!! Portions are fair and of decent amount. You will definitely satisfy a mean hunger!  We tried the AYCE Dinner 1 with steamed egg, beef brisket, shrimp, pork belly, and pork shoulder. The accompanied side dishes were amazing. My favorite was the clear noodles, kimchi, veggie tempura, pickled seaweed, and the pork shoulder, which was very favorable. The salad that comes with the meal is served in a huge bowl that is enough for at least 4-6 servings and delicious as well!! I was not too crazy about the macaroni salad or the tofu fish sticks.   So why 4 stars instead of 5 you ask? Well, though Doh K BBQ was very good, it has not beat the best Korean food I have ever tasted, and that was at a Korean BBQ restaurant I use to frequent in San Diego, CA back in the day. Doh is just one notch below what that place was in taste.   If you want great service, fresh meats, good food, with a clean and modern ambience then give Doh Korean BBQ a try. A la carte or AYCE you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love this place! The staff is friendly their sides are yummy. It's very clean. I have no complaints. :)"}
{"text":"Quality of the meat is probably the best of all the KBBQ restaurants. The pork belly crisps up like a thick slice of bacon, and the two types of bulgogi are marinated perfectly well. They have really good quality brisket, and have this steamed egg (which look weird but is oddly very good). It's still the same price as all the other KBBQ places, but differ from them when it comes to their quality of meats. What I definitely will be coming back for is their different sauces! OMG! best dipping sauces ever! It's good for big groups, too! Try their plum wine!  Service is also really great, they are very attentive."}
{"text":"Amazing food, especially for the price. You automatically get starters when you sit down that are all great so you don't have to wait to long to get a bite in while you're waiting for the food to come/cook. That being said, you have to cook your own meat but that's not difficult at all."}
{"text":"I had a great experience! Our waitress was so customer friendly, always refilling our drinks, and changing our grill when it wasn't looking clean anymore from us cooking. And the meat never came out frozen, always fresh.  The only thing I can complain about was the pork belly, not as flavorful as I wanted it to be but it was still delicious!"}
{"text":"Walked in at 5pm on a Tuesday and it was empty. Around 6pm is when it started getting packed. There's two options: AYCE and A La Carte. Thank goodness for these two options! This was our first time here so we just ordered 3 meats to start off with. Glad we only ordered 3! Their portions are huge! We're Polynesians and we couldn't even finish everything from the 3 meats we ordered! Lol, if this will be your first time going here, do half orders to start off with. Their full orders will make you switch from paying the AYCE price to the A La Carte price because you get to take home whatever you don't finish. That's what we had to do. Other than that, service and atmosphere was great. Good date night place and it's conveniently located near Gelatology for dessert :)"}
{"text":"Doh is a solid option for AYCE Korean BBQ. The restaurant is modern, trendy, and spacious. The wait on a Sunday night was less than 10 minutes. There is ample parking. Pricing is competitive. It loses a star because the amount of menu options is limited compared to a place like Hwaro. Nevertheless, I'd come here again."}
{"text":"I love a good KBBQ. This was our family's first time. The place looked clean, seating was nice and not cluttered. We were there in a Friday night with a party of five and it was 815pm. There were only 3 parties ahead of us and it was a twenty minute wait. We were seated in 15 minutes.   The place was modern and there were cute semi private booths on the right side of the restaurant, which is where we got seated. We sat perfectly since our party included two children (5 and 3 yr olds).   The staff was courteous and attentive. They refilled our water carafe frequently and made sure we were okay on our meats.   We had beef tongue, pork belly, beef brisket, spicy squid, boneless kalbi, steamed egg, and red wine pork belly. My fave is always the beef tongue and I really enjoyed the boneless kalbi because they sliced it thin enough to cook quick and the meat was very tender. The salad was awesome too! I enjoy salad with my meats because I hate to eat just meat. My kids looooved the steamed egg, although, I wish I knew there was going to be that much green onion because my 3 yr old kept asking me to remove the onions.   At the end of dinner we got single packets of Michu ice cream which we all love!   Overall, I'd definitely love to go back here again. Didn't get to review the restroom, as we didn't need to go this evening."}
{"text":"The food was great but very very limited choices   I would definitely go somewhere else for ace Korean bbq that's for the same price. Shout out to the guy who was serving us and the whole restaurant too while his Co worker sat back and just watched him"}
{"text":"This place has amazing customer service *came in right when it opened* super friendly waiter, I'm not from around here and had a craving so I kinda was skeptical when I saw the limited menu but truth be told it was good might go back next time I'm there"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and it was really good. We had the bulgogi, brisket and short ribs. We had to pay extra for these options. Service was good, there were only about 4 other parties.  We had the standard Korean sides, kimchi, macaroni, etc. It was all you can eat so you can't really go wrong. The place was slightly smoky but not too bad. We were in and out fairly quickly. Overall, the food was good, service was prompt and I'd definitely return."}
{"text":"BEST KOREAN BBQ I'VE EVER EATEN !  We were Lucky to find this all-you-can-eat (AYCE) Korean BBQ. In a new shopping center 5 minutes from the strip. I've eaten at a lot of AYCE bbqs.... Around the country.... This was by far the BEST!   The brisket and boneless short rib was tender and tasty. All the meats including spicy pork melted in my mouth. Sounds cliche but it really was that good. The shrimp was fresh and marinated. The sides were various and plentiful. In some AYCE places the staff is Luke warm to customers. In DOH they were great. They all smiled and kept asking if we wanted refills of anything including the meats. This was a very friendly group.    The decor is cool too. All new modern stainless steel and marble with a music video screen in form of a cool clock running K-Pop vids (who doesn't love K-Pop) non stop but with low sound so it was really enjoyable as background.  If you like Korean BBQ you have to find DOH. You won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"Me and my husband are not AYCE ppl, so I can't really commend on AYCE other than that they look reasonably priced. But two a la cart along with all the side dishes are enough to feed 3 adults!!! Love the beef tongue, the barley tea and the service. It's our new go-to spot when we crave for Korean food!"}
{"text":"We loved this place!! We are vacationing here & decided to try this place out since they had great reviews.   Service was awesome. Our hostess was so nice & explained to us the menu. What a great price for all you can eat!!!  So much selection and everything tastes great. We will definitely be back here again.   They also gave us mochi ice cream & that was really good. They had a selection of strawberry, green tea & mango   Interior of the restaurant was really up to date & modern. Loved their look"}
{"text":"It's not as busy as other AYCE Korean BBQ places, which is a plus for large groups &/or when I'm starving & can't wait. It's also more convenient if you live in the area & don't want to drive down Spring Mountain.  Their service is incredible. Their waiters just seem to rotate around & constantly make sure we are okay. My boyfriend & I even ate here when it was Christmas Eve & New Years Eve with no issues.   We're in & out under an hour leaving very full & satisfied."}
{"text":"Love this place. Small and cozy. Everyone is very attentive. The side dishes are delicious and they give you a mochi ice cream for dessert."}
{"text":"Yay we finally have Korean bbq near where I live . I gave this place two stars despite it being new .. They are the sister of tofu hut so I would think they would have more experience with handling everything .. Waited a while for the servers , meat was ok , they definitely need more ban Chan tho.  Hopefully the next time I go it'll be better ."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time tonight, love that it's 5 min from my house. Service was friendly and excellent, they were very prompt and refilled everything we needed. The meats we ordered were very tender and tasty and the salad was Delish. My favorite was the steamed egg dish, you can't get that at every Korean BBQ and the barley tea, which you can get hot or iced. The prices were great, especially compared to Sura. I would definitely recommend. They're open for lunch and dinner, we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place because it's close to home, but I can't. After trying it out 3 - 4 times since they first opened, I don't think I will visit this place anymore. The main reason is the meat quality is so bad, it tasted like chewing a thin stack of bland school paper that has been soaked in water. Take beef bulgogi for example. It seemed that they buy really cheap and tough quality meat, hammer the heck out of it (including the juice) to make it tender to eat and marinate it with really sweet bulgogi sauce to mask the blandness of the meat. I don't expect the quality to be as good as Hwaro or other a la cart place; because of close distance to home, I'm okay if the quality is just decent. So disappointed, I guess the nearby Goong will do for now."}
{"text":"One of the newer all you can eat Korean bbq places around. The place is small but has a nice rustic feel to it. I like the design of the place, but that's not the only thing, the food is pretty good too. The meat is probably one of the better meats I've tasted at a all you can eat. The short ribs are very tender and they removed the move already for you. The only thing we got that was frozen was the pork belly. The sides her are also pretty good. The salad was surprisingly good and helped balance the meat out nicely. They always give you a good amount of food in each plate you order so make sure you don't order too much. We couldn't finish some of the meat on our last plate but they were nice and didn't charge us extra or anything but don't test that. The service and food was pretty good overall, will be back!"}
{"text":"Not bad, came here three times for lunch, since it was semi close to the house.  All times, we didn't have any issue.  The service is better than most AYCE KBBQ.  I feel like this is a quick bite, some KBBQ spots I feel like you're there forever waiting to be seated, order, pay the bill.  The food was good, nothing special though.  We never had to wait longer than 5 minutes, there were tables open the times we went.  Only waited for the server to setup the table."}
{"text":"Just finish eating here with my dad and let me just say the food and service was great.  This is my 2nd Korean BBQ spot and I say it's past their competition.  If you're wondering it is all you can eat with about 16 meat selection. Unlike other spots that are by the sections. I will definitely come back if I'm in the area.  My server was Ryan."}
{"text":"First time here, had the best experience.  Customer service was hands down the best I've ever received.  Our server, Ryan, took great care of us, was super helpful, and even opened the door for us on the way out.  The brisket, bulgogi, and short rib were on point!"}
{"text":"Decent all you can eat kbbq local spot in the area but very slow service. Fairly nice staff but I wish I had received more attention."}
{"text":"Good price. Nice decor. Service is on point. Variety of meat to choose a little small but we're love this place. I have been here a few times never disappointed. Will comeback for more."}
{"text":"Better than tofu hut! I know they are sister company but this is waaay better than tofu Hut. Meat is well seasoned and salad is great. It's clean and the servers are great. I went during opening time and it sucks that there was only 1 server until 12 or so. It made ordering slow since the half of the restaurant is already filled. Love the place will come back! Supper cheap too!"}
{"text":"My husband wanted Korean BBQ and I didn't want to drive across town.... I am so pleased that we tried this place. Food was great, service was great, the only negative was an automatic gratuity for a party of 5."}
{"text":"In trying to get Korean BBQ at a wider range of places while here in Vegas, I asked another local friend for recommendations and Doh was one of them. We came in last night around 8:30 and just had a short wait. I like the décor in here, it's stylish and simple, and I love the k pop projected on the wall.  While we waited, a group paid and they were able to split the check as many ways as the group wanted. Maybe that's standard here, but in California, most places limit the number of cards they'll split the check into.   I don't love how big all of the tables are though, since it seems like there is a lot of wasted space when there are couples at all these tables that seat 4-7. And the booths, while really cute, seat more people than should really share just one grill, imo.  The grill is shaped weird to me, being higher in the middle and sloping to the outer ring. It makes it hard to cook shrimp, since the hottest part of the grill is the middle but they slide down the slight slope. The vents though are where it's at! I love not cooking in a cloud of smoke and not having to worry about my clothes and hair smelling like cooking meat when I leave.  Once we were seated, service was so fast!! We just went with dinner 1 since we weren't really hungry enough for the 6-8oz ribeye that the dinner 2 gets you. Only four more dollars for a ribeye per person? That is a great deal.  The salad is similar to the one at tofu hut (owned by the same company) but it seemed to have a bit more kick to it. I loved the macaroni salad that came out with the sides - sooooooo non traditional but so yummy and a little taste of carbs for someone who doesn't care for rice.  We got the tongue, brisket, beef bulgogi, and head on shrimp. I found the tongue here chewier than some other places so I wasn't really a fan. The brisket was great, and complemented by the oils so well. It was nicely marbled and I, who doesn't like to eat the pure fat, could avoid those parts easily enough. The bulgogi was sweeter than I liked but my friend really liked it. The head on shrimp were wonderful. I love them and can't get them at tofu hut. I ate them all.  The wait staff were really attentive, asking how everything was and if we needed anything else quite a bit throughout the meal. I'd love to come back when I'm hungrier or with more people so I can try the ribeye, and also the shirt rib and chicken bulgogi. Also there's a gelato place next door for some dessert!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite AYCE Korean BBQ restaurant other than Hwaro which has been too busy n far to go. The location is great!! Love that it is in the southwest on Windmill & Rainbow in the Smiths Plaza by us making it our go to spot because it's so much more convenient than going all the way to Chinatown. This will be the new cash cow plaza in the southwest with Doh being here along with Serenade, gelatology, Pho 88, and more to come with the new additional buildings being built.   Inside is super spacious and very clean! Everything is stainless steal from the chopsticks to the bowls to the cups. Table is made of granite (I think I could be wrong lol) making it very nice and easy to clean. Ventilation is great with the vents that pull down towards the grill making it way less smokey. Service is great! Everyone here is very attentive and they come to change your dirty grill often without you even having to ask which is a major plus!  Quality of the meats are very good!! My go to order is the Beef Tongue, Short rib meat (so so super soft), shrimp with head, squid, and brisket. Ban Chan is great!! Love the salad here!! Their dressing is so good and flavorful! $19.99 for AYCE with great quality you can't go wrong with that. Every paid meal comes with 1 mochi ice cream each"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere since we're in the booth and felt so separated from everybody somehow and had privacy. Service was on point and I never had to ask a waitress to refill my drink. However, food was not the greatest. I actually prefer Goong Korean Restaurant for the food quality compared to here. The beef was so thin that it breaks with I try to remove it from the grill.  but 5 stars for the atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"The lady who helped me was friendly and helpful (first time doing Korean BBQ) the restaurant is clean and modern I loved the food and the service the price was well worth it!!!"}
{"text":"This is our new favorite korean bbq place. The food is great and the service is wonderful. They will help you cook if you are unsure of how to cook the meat you ordered, and make sure everything is served quickly. We like the brisket, the pork belly, bulgogi and steamed egg. Definitely worth visiting on this side of town."}
{"text":"I'm a little disappointed in my experience because I did have high expectations.  Ambience is simple, not much of a \"wow\" factor.  Dinner is about $20 for AYCE. There aren't a lot of choices on the menu, just the simple ones; brisket, short rib, chicken, etc & 2 seafood choices. However, the quality of the meat is very good. There was a time where our server forgot to bring out something we ordered, but we let it slide.   MAJOR CON: One of us ordered a soup and apparently you can't have it a la carte, so they were going to charge her for an AYCE, but she knew we didn't know so just discounted it.   I still enjoyed my dinner and it's convenient to have around the area. But I can honestly say every other Korean BBQ spot I've been to is better than this."}
{"text":"We went in around 10:30p and got immediate seating. We selected the Dinner I which is really everything except the Rib Eye Prime. Dinner II is an additional $4.00.   Our order: Sliced Brisket - 4/5 Sliced Tongue - 3.5/5 Short Rib - 1/5 very soggy, ground beef texture Bulgogi - 1/5 bland, ground beef texture  Our take: the marinated stuff comes out soggy. When cooked through, the texture is similar to ground beef.   Summary: Value: 5/5 at $19.95/person Service: 2.5/5 nothing spectacular Food: 2.5/5 see above Ambiance: 4/5 clean  Will not be returning.  WiFi password is 7025387887"}
{"text":"Cheapest Korean Bbq.. You get so much bang for your buck here. The service is fast and all the meats are decent. And the atmosphere is very comfortable."}
{"text":"Food and service were great. It's a little open, and loud inside. Probably not great for an intimate date-night.  It's also very small. We got in and got a table pretty quickly, but noticed a long line forming right after we we're seated, and our table was really close to the line.  This created a sense of feeling rushed, and that's a bit uncomfortable.   Overall, it was great though, and I will be returning."}
{"text":"This place is an alright Korean BBQ joint in town the side dishes and meat selections were acceptable but there are better Korean BBQ spots in town. The service here could be a lot better. went here on two different occasions and both times the service was not as good. They take forever taking our order or coming back to check on us if we want more meat. The atmosphere here is nice and modern"}
{"text":"We love Doh! The service is always great. Ryan is awesome! We have yet to have had a bad experience are Doh. We will definitely be back! Probably sometime this week lol"}
{"text":"This restaurant is the sister of Tofu Hut. It's amazing! They still have the oil, salt, and pepper dipping sauce for your meat (plus two additional sauces). They serve you the same salad as Tofu Hut, as well as some similar side dishes - japche, pancake, kimchee, and seaweed. I usually go for dinner and they have 'Dinner 1' and 'Dinner 2' options, dinner 2 is more expensive because it gives you access to all the meats. However, dinner 1 does usually cover about 90% of the menu so I stick with that option. Their short ribs are bomb! I love how they tenderize their meat for the marination process. For two people, dinner 1 would be around $46 (rounding up, not including tip.) the servers are extremely friendly and they do try their best to cook your meat for you when they're not busy. Also, they have barley iced-tea, which is such a delicious beverage that comes with AYCE.   Last call at 11:00pm (hour before closing.)"}
{"text":"The food and service were unlike any kbbq restaurant that I have been at.  The nice waitress helped cool our food and was sweet.  Since my new place is by here, I will be visiting more often lol.    Try the tongue and sear it with vinegar.  You are welcome.  Try it now."}
{"text":"It was very disappointing. We went in before 3 pm and waited for them to seat us . We ordered beef brisket, beef tongue, bulgogi and spicy pork. They only gave us a bunch of beef brisket and beef tongue. We had to ask them for the bulgogi and gave up on the spicy pork since they brought out so much of the other meats. When we got the check we were charged the dinner price because we were seated after 3 pm and when I looked at the check I saw that they gave us 2 orders of beef brisket and beef tongue! That is a total ripoff especially since they charged us the dinner price and we thought we were being charged the lunch price so we didn't order any of the dinner meats! We are never going back there again!"}
{"text":"Brisket is my favorite when I go to Korean BBQ. Brisket here is a little chewy, gladly I like it well done and a little crunchy, then its not as chewy anymore. Good customer service."}
{"text":"Wasn't a super fan of this place, the meats had a little bit to much fat for my liking. Like everyone else said it was super cold inside. I would definitely pick Gen Korean BBQ over this place"}
{"text":"First time trying Doh and it was delicious. Very friendly staff and will answer all of your questions. Loved the beef bulgogi! I I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place definitely hit the spot! The establishment was super clean, not too busy, and the servers were way friendlier than others at AYCE joints. We came in during lunch and it was worth every penny!!! My son even enjoyed himself! He loved everything from the water to the dessert. I love the barley tea! I can seriously drink that all day, everyday!!! The ban chan (sides) were delicious, I wish they offered bean sprouts! The meats were cut and marinated to perfection. The brisket is my absolute favorite! I love the combination of the brisket and sesame oil/salt and pepper with a hint of white rice. Wow, so so yum. My mouth is salivating while typing this review thinking about this time at Doh. I've been wanting to come here since moving to this side of town, it couldn't have came a better time. We can't wait to go again and again and again."}
{"text":"This is the best place to eat Korean barbecue. See Adrian he's a great server. I think this place beats all Las Vegas Korean barbecue.10/10 make sure you tip them good if you eat this place."}
{"text":"i came here with very low expectations because i've been to Tofu Hut many times and it always left me feeling disappointed albeit satisfied. but we dont want to just be satisfied, we want to feel good about our meal and we want to enjoy it as we are dining. Upon entering Doh, i was immediately pleasantly surprised because the hostess greeted us right away and sat us. Our server Adrian(sp?) was very adequate and nice, but he seemed a bit overwhelmed since the restaurant was full, so i think they could use a couple more servers to ease up the load and work faster. the food itself was good- signature tofu hut salad is in deed like crack(havent experienced that myself but i imagine its an expression most fitting for this), brisket was thin/soft/juicy and beef tongue had great texture, red wine pork belly was delicious, and kalbi was also tender and juicy. The overall flavor was great. i'll be coming back because its so very close to our house but i still think for now Hwaro is the best in Vegas."}
{"text":"I wouldn't recommend this place. My boyfriend got food poisoning. Stay far away. The quality of their meat is terrible... mostly fat! We were so excited to try this place & were extremely disappointed. We will definitely NOT be returning."}
{"text":"Great BBQ. Sides were awesome and their marinated meats were delicious. 10/10 Would recommend."}
{"text":"This is the second BBQ on one day that dictates what you can eat.  There was just the two of is and I want all you can eat and the wife wanted a regular entree.  We we told that we both have to be all you can eat or just entree can not split.   No exceptions. New rules.  So we left."}
{"text":"Small but clean. Lunch price was worth it. Friendly staff which is a major plus. Steamed egg was the best I've ever had! Their salad was delicious! Highly recommend this kbbq. Nice to have a new kbbq place to go to especially on the southwest."}
{"text":"Clean environment. Professional staff. Good pricing. Tastey food.   Great value at $17/person AYCE lunch. May not satisfy those seeking a wide array of options. The menu satisfied me, though I tend to lean towards simple meals. YMMV.   Recommended to anyone who enjoys Korean BBQ and doesn't necessarily desire kitschy menu items. I personally find lunch the best value, but lunch doesn't offer short ribs (kalbi)."}
{"text":"1st visit based on yelp reviews decided to give it a try. Loved the food, the service, cleanliness, AYCE prices  and mochi ice cream at the end!"}
{"text":"OMG! So disappointed with this place...they pretended not to see you...they give very small portions and don't come back to check on you ...i asked for shrimps, and this guy asks me how many? i said ,\" about 6 pieces\". He didn't come back so I went to him and told him about the shrimp order. He came to our table and gave me 3 pices of shrimp. FYI, i was with my family and we were 4. FYI, those shrimps are not even big enough. They took their tip with the bill right away. It's a good thing my wife checked the bill. I don't know why the other reviews are good. Did we go to the same place?"}
{"text":"Being a Korean barbecue lover this is quite disappointing. The decorations and set up is very attractive but for a place that has a grand opening the business model needs a big change. We had half an order of meat left,  and we're finishing up before given our check we made payment and the server came back to say eat that last piece or we will charge you because there's cameras. That was very rude you will tell by the server when you walk in you can't miss her face just shows how ignorant she is in terms of service. The food was not marinated well, The vegetable trays were obviously sitting out because the macaroni mayonnaise  was crusty and we all know with mayonnaise it spoils quickly.  For new establishment they should be providing extra service and extra food to entice new business. After reading several reviews I find it appalling that management would allow this knowing they have already run a successful business previously. We will not go back until reviews have improved regarding service and quality of food although we live really close by we will make the drive down to spring mountain."}
{"text":"Really really good! If I'm in the area and in the mood for Korean BBQ, I'll be here. This is one of my favorite Korean BBQ eateries next to Gen and Hwaro.   We always get the marinated beef and marinated boneless ribs. Beef brisket is good too and there are a lot of sides! Also the steamed egg is always good when cooled down.   I just wish this place has gyoza or other appetizers but in all, I'll keep coming back here. If my friends have extra room in their stomachs, we end up going to Rolled Ice Cream after!"}
{"text":"When I first heard that this was going to be part of the Doh group, I wasn't that particularly interested in trying it. I've tried their Doh AYCE sushi location in Chinatown and it didn't exactly amaze me and I'm not a fan of Tofu Hut either. However, I was just craving some Korean BBQ meats and I didn't want to drive all the way to Chinatown for it, so my boyfriend and I decided to give Doh a try.   The interior is definitely cute. It is very clean and organized inside. They have about three round tables that can sit 4-5 people. They're not huge round tables so they actually remind me of the small round tables that you'll see in Hong Kong street stalls. They have three \"booths\" along the side of the wall -- well they're more like a box in the wall where you can sit.. kind of cute. The vents that they have are pretty amazing. The vents are adjustable so it's lowered all the way down to just above the grill but it will get in your way of staring at your partner. After your meal, you are able to adjust it back up so it won't be in your face. Best part? You don't leave the restaurant smelling like KBBQ. WIN! I LIKE IT.   If you are here for AYCE, you have two options: $19.95 or $23.95. The $23.95 dinner allows you to order the rib eye steak but it is one order per person. Now, you are completely allowed to do what we did: I ordered the $19.95 dinner and my boyfriend ordered the $23.95 dinner so we shared the rib eye. Because, let's be real, we don't have the stomach to eat two rib eyes AND everything else.   The banchan included kimchi, ddukbokki, macaroni salad, and pickled daikon. The kimchi was delicious. It was so delicious that we even got a second serving of it. It was probably some of the best kimchi I've had here in Vegas. It was also a nice addition to be able to have some ddukbokki considering that it's not part of your usual banchan combo. They also had a huge bowl of salad as well.   Everyone got a salt/pepper & sesame oil sauce for meat dipping, which I LOVE. In many places, I usually have to ask for this but they auto gave it to everyone here! They also give you fermented soybean paste, which I don't use but I appreciate the thought. Then they also have a small side of garlic and jalapenos, and I definitely ate those. It definitely shows that they're pretty traditional with their condiments.   We ended up ordering brisket, beef tongue, kalbi, pork belly, and steamed egg. Let me begin by telling you that their portions are no joke. This isn't Gen BBQ where they give you 4-5 pieces of kalbi and beef tongue per order. They gave a plate full of brisket, a plate full of beef tongue, three strips of kabi, and we had to ask them to only give us one strip of pork belly.   Their brisket was normal. Beef tongue was a bit on the chewier side but still good. The kalbi was really good -- the marinate wasn't intensely sweet. Pork belly was also decent. Their egg was pretty fluffy and it would go great with rice.   The service was excellent. They would often check up on us and was able to answer every one of our questions. If we had no meat to cook, they would ask if we would like to order more meat. Wonderful :)   Overall, I think Doh is pretty good. At their price point, it is definitely better than a lot of KBBQ places in Las Vegas. The only downside is their lack of variety .. however, I typically only eat brisket and beef tongue during KBBQ so it is definitely not a downside for me. Their meat quality is definitely not the best but not the worst either.   I would definitely be back. Count on it."}
{"text":"Came in on a Friday dinner. Seated right away for party of 5. The place was clean and modern feel. Decided to get the all you can eat dinner II which comes with rib eye steak each person. Prize was comparable to most AYCE korean bbq. We were started with the side dishes right away.  They give you good amount with refills as well.  We started off with the rib eye and thin slice brisket. followed with marinated short ribs and pork black belly then shrimp. the quality meat was decent. there dipping sauce was bland. definitely lacked in sweetness and flavor. The servers were accommodating and friendly. they frequently checked on our table. They brought our orders right away. all in all the service was A+ but food needs improvement."}
{"text":"I crave kbbq every week, I usually go to Korean Garden and Gen bbq, this time I decided to try DOH. First of all its closer to my boyfriend's house so it's really convenient. Went inside and I just like to say that this place is very modern, I love the ambience. We got sat by Adrian, just wanted to say he's an amazing server, he's very quick and attentive.   03/03/16 came in with my boyfriend and another couple, they sat us right away, but took forever to take our order. Our usual server is Adrian, but he was busy, so we waited and we still didn't get any service. What really pisses me off is one of the employee reprimanded one of the server in front of customers, how unprofessional and disrespectful."}
{"text":"Ive been to about 4-5 Korean BBQ in Vegas and this place is as good as any of them. It's relatively new so it is not very busy yet. The place is very nice and clean inside. We were there early in the day so it was only 16.99 for ayce. Later for dinner I believe it is $21.99 ayce. Ask for Jeanie as your waitress, she is the best!"}
{"text":"Been here twice and they haven't let me down yet! Their banchan (side dishes) took over the table--i love it! My second visit had 8 of us at a table and they were accommodating enough to set up a table for us before we arrived. Service alone was 5 stars. Their constant refill of sides and asking if we wanted to order more meat kept our large group full and content.   One of the grills had stoped working in the middle of service and they were kind enough to offer us dessert as a result. Fantastic customer service.  Meats were flavorful, and cooked quickly on their stove which my mouth and stomach appreciated. I highly recommend this place for those who can't get enough of Korean BBQ. It's the place for newbies and foodies alike."}
{"text":"This place is great. I went during lunch time and the service was great. Their food was very good. The price here is also very reasonable. At least it's more reasonable than other Korean BBQ places here in Las Vegas. I would definitely be coming back here if I crave some KBBQ."}
{"text":"Went here on a whim. LOVED IT. The staff was very attentive and the food was great! Loved the whole vibe I got from this place. The price was totally worth the AYCE!"}
{"text":"All you can eat Korean BBQ for 23$ or 22$ whatever. Just be sure to eat everything because in Vegas there is a surcharge for wasted food. Never witnessed this at an all you can eat in my life other than Vegas. Lol   Justin-  @dabvandamme on IG and Twitter follow me!"}
{"text":"Location is great since there is no other Korean bbq restaurants located in the southwest area. This restaurant is located right next to Serenade and Gelatology so it's pretty easy to spot.  The interior of this restaurant gives off a vintage vibe. The ventilation is not the best but I can say it's better than tofu hut over at china town. Some of the things that they serve here that other korean bbq restaurants doesn't have are doboki, veggie tempura, barley tea."}
{"text":"this place is unbelievable in a great way clean, delicious, great service (jenny) one of the best ayce korean bbq i've ever been and i've been to a lot we came back and service was even better ask for ryan food spot on!!!"}
{"text":"I'll keep this short. Watch their video Very relaxed atmosphere, tentative staffing (they changed our grill 4 times!), Beers are ice cold, and quality of meats is perfect.  Also if you're not good at the cooking portion, they will step in and help out.  I'm writing this at 5am just woke up from my food coma. Whose ready for gym time"}
{"text":"Food and service were so-so. The server didn't speak to us for more than 3 words, which was very sad. Meat was ok, a little bit greasy and then we discovered that they didn't give us salad at the end of our meal and that's why I felt a little noxious after eating meat only. Came here cuz it's close to our house but with so many good Korean BBQ places in town, don't think we're coming back."}
{"text":"Delicious meats and salad. Not smoky like other Korean bbq where you cook food in the middle. Price was about average for AYCE."}
{"text":"Super cute decor! The fried potato/veggie croquet was a yummy starter and the sides were pretty standard, nothing that jumps out from the rest. We were suggested their ribeye so that's what we started with, and it was as good as suggested. It was moist and flavorful. I was not a fan of their marinated meats  they all had an overly strong flavor of wine/alcohol and no trace of any other flavors (IMO), very bland. I preferred their non-marinated meats since the marinate was just straight up wine, didn't taste like soy, garlic, etc. The egg soufflé was my favorite, it was perfect and fluffy! We had 5-10 minute \"intermissions\" between servings of meat as there were only two servers and they were running around frantically. They were definitely slammed and could have used more help. We didn't eat as much as we would/could have typically at any other joint with the waiting around for more meat & sides but we gave up trying to order anything else. They did just open though so I'll be understanding of that, but I was a little disappointed with the speed of service which is what (good) Korean restaurants endorse. I'm willing to give it another shot in a few weeks and see if improvements are made."}
{"text":"This was my favorite KBBQ place but the last few visits have made me unsure if it still is. Last time I came here with my mom was around noon on a Saturday and understandably they were a bit busy but when I requested for a table for 2, the server looked terribly annoyed and in a rude tone said \"Can you just sit down?\" Rolled her eyes and walked away. I didn't think too much into it but my mom & I just continued standing not thinking it was a deal just cause we didn't feel like sitting on their waiting chairs. Then the same server (this older lady) came by us again and said the same thing in an even more rude tone. I'm not sure what the big deal is with the fact that we're standing as we wait for our table??   Thankfully another server had our table ready but I was already pretty upset at this point at their customer service. We ordered off the lunch menu and did enjoy our meal at the beginning, but towards the middle we noticed they took a while to give our meats out and when we would ask for 3 orders of brisket, they would bring out a plate that looked like it was only one order. The annoying part too was while we were cooking the rude server would keep coming to our table to lower down the fire when we were perfectly fine with how it was set. Towards the end of our meal the rude server tried being nicer but I definitely wasn't having it. She also took forever to get our check to us and didn't say a word, not even a thank you or bye when we finished paying.   The quality of the meat seems like it's gone down the past few visits and I feel like I can definitely tell the difference between their dinner and lunch meats. Personally, I feel like they save their \"better\" quality meats for dinner since it does taste different during lunch. We weren't very satisfied at the end of our meal and I noticed I've been feeling that way the past few visits so maybe Doh is just \"okay\" to me now.  I love how spacious it is compared to other KBBQ places and the waits aren't terrible. The price is definitely a pro since it's cheaper than other KBBQ places: $16.95 for lunch, $19.95 for Dinner I and $23.95 for Dinner II (includes rib eye). Their customer service definitely needs work though. I'm not sure if I'll be back here for a while."}
{"text":"Went here on April 1 and was totally disappointed with the quality of meat and service. Additionally, they automatically add 18% tip for a mediocre service. I guess won't be going back to this joint."}
{"text":"We arrived, seated and immediately it was last call.  We were okay with that except they added an automatic tip for a party of 4.  That's outrageous.  We always tip great but we felt so hurried when they were still open for another hour.  Left hungry even though we paid for AYCE."}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorite AYCE Korean BBQ joint in Vegas. Only wish they have the lettuce to wrap my kalbi or beef tongue with.. but the chopped salad will do perfectly. Staff is always friendly and the setting is awesome.. be ready to wait during the peak times.. as it can get pretty crowded real quick.."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff.  Clean and tidy place. The salad is fantastic.   The meats are what you would expect from an AYCE buffet.   For me the marinated beef short rib was the best.  It was tender, well marinated and damn good.  The steamed egg was well done and we ended up ordering three of them.    I wish they would have a fried rice rather than just a plain white rice.  It was definitely a missing component.  Overall a good experience and a decent alternative to Spring Mountain for those that live in the south side of town."}
{"text":"Pros:  Shrimp, Beef brisket, Friendly Service  Cons:  Poor lighting on tables. Meats are not as flavorable as they could be.  We wanted to try this place for a while after our friends recommended it.  The AYCE dinner for $20 is a good value for the money.  The best part is that the shrimp (head on) are included!  I could go back and eat nothing but the shrimp, which were juicy medium sized prawns.  The sliced beef brisket is also very good, but the serving portion is fairly large. The chicken bulgogi was good, but I wish the marinade was a little stronger.   The side dishes are great including the kim chi, salad, and vegetable tempura. The dipping sauces were helpful for some of the less flavorful meats.  They recommended the beef short rib which was boneless and marinated.  The flavor was good but the spongy texture was not my favorite.  The red wine pork belt was also mediocre.   Overall I am happy we tried this place.  We would like to try other places in town, but will probably come back some day."}
{"text":"The food here is bomb...in a good way of course. Who doesn't love korean BBQ? Friendly customer service and great food choices to cook. I love that they have a water pitcher so that you have to keep asking for refills. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Went with a group of coworkers for lunch one day - I think there were 10 or 11 of us. Normally, the big tables only accommodate 8, but we squeezed in together at one table. The decor is trendy but doesn't stand out as anything super special to me.   The lunch menu is pretty good - you get all the side/appetizer fixings that are standard at KBBQ restaurants. For the AYCE, the price was good and there was a nice selection of meats. The selection was smaller than other places I've been, but everything we had was delicious. The server was great at keeping water glasses filled and bringing out more meat as we ordered.   The price was good for lunch and did include mochi at the end (yum!). For large groups, they do include gratuity.   It was a super fun and good food and I'll likely head back!"}
{"text":"Doh is one of my favorite go-to locations for Korean BBQ. The environment is more so modern compared to other Korean BBQ restaurants due to it being fairly new.  They have a great selection of meats on the menu for both lunch and dinner. If you have ever tried tofu hut, the meat is almost identical in regards to quality. My favorite would be the marinated sliced rib eye bulgogi (tastes like the marinated ribeye from tofu hut). Adding on to that, their grills are the perfect size and come with a piece of fat you can use to grease up your grill so your meat doesn't get stuck.  Pricing is pretty similar to other locations. For lunch- it's $16.95 and for dinner- $19.95. There's usually not that long of a wait even on weekends at night. The longest I've had to wait was ten minutes. One of the items on the menu that most kbbq places don't have is vegetable tempura. Their dessert (not included in AYCE) is mochi ice cream. Absolutely love Doh!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite KBBQ spot to go to. No nonsense menu which has the essentials (brisket, beef tongue, bulgogi), including seafood and all the right sides.  But what sets this place apart from other shops is the service with smiles. I say smiles because I've never seen anyone that looked like they didn't want to be there, and that's staff and customers!  They treat you like family!"}
{"text":"First and foremost, location is excellent from where I live. It's great not having to drive into Chinatown or nearby if I want to have KBBQ now.   I've been here twice so far -- first time during lunch and then another time for a later dinner.   Service was pretty great during lunch because it was literally just my table and one other table. The evening one was a lot busier (even a waitlist) so it makes sense why service wasn't as on point.   Definitely a plus -- they have steamed egg!! It does take awhile to come out, of course.   They have not just plain pork belly but also red wine pork belly. Not a fan, though. I don't usually like marinated meats so ones like pork belly and sliced tongue are great.   Salad is great just like Tofu Hut. Looking forward to them offering a late happy hour option in the future like Tofu Hut. But they're only open to 1am right now with a 12am late call."}
{"text":"I've only been here once. Only because the location is  a pretty far drive. However, I fell in love with the quality of the meats. The menu is extremely limited compared to other KBBQ AYCE joints. But the marinated ribeye makes up for everything. They have pretty good salad and banchan, as well. Be careful with the desert! They wont tell you it is an extra charge!  I would go every week if it was conveniently closer to where I stay.  $20 AYCE.  *heart eyes*"}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday night for dinner, with a group of 6 people. As expected, there was a bit of a line to get seated, but it was a Saturday night so it was understood. The place has 4 double grills that can sit 8 per table. 3 booths that can sit 6, and  tables for 2s and 4s. The place is fairly brand new so it is really clean, the interior decoration is also really nice. They have a modern feel to it.  We got the dinner 1 option which was an all you can eat for $20, there was another option for $25 where it had steak on the menu included. The service was fast considering how busy it was, and they were also friendly and talkative with their customers. The dinner 1 option included meats such as beef brisket, tounge, short rib, and steak. On the pork side, you has pork belly, pork shoulder, and some other 2 that I can't remember. On chicken, you get and mild or spicy bulgogi, they also serve head on shrimp and squid with the dinner option."}
{"text":"I was super excited to see that a Korean bbq has finally opened in the southwest side of town. Having been told this place is new, clean and good food I thought I'd try it out. I like the decor, however, is still rather drive to China Town for good Korean BBQ. Service was ok, there was one lady who was stellar though, she was helping our server. The food is mediocre and I believe places such as Hwaro and Sura are cheaper with better quality, every time a new grill was brought it was always still wet. The kicker, my little sister was headed to the restroom and my server ran from another table to get to the restroom BEFORE my little sister did, even pushing her out of the way. I guess she REALLY needed to use the restroom."}
{"text":"I heard a lot of things about this place, mostly bad. But I honestly enjoyed it my first try. I liked their brisket and their marinated steak. It was pretty delicious, tender, and had some flavor to it. They have the same salad as tofu hut so I was extremely happy in that case. The interior was cute, much more hipster than most KBBQ places. Service was on point, they always asked us if we needed anything and changed our grill as needed. Definitely a spot I'd love to take my boyfriend to! Just sucks that it's super far from my house."}
{"text":"Great AYCE Korean BBQ in Vegas!  Great food, service with a local atmosphere. Try this first, and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Doh is officially my favorite spot for AYCE KBBQ. It's quiet, the service is great, and the AYCE dinner is only $20. We ordered red wine brisket, bulgogi, tongue, head on shrimp, squid, and pork belly. The sides were good, but I wish they had pickled radish.  The salad was so good we ordered four bowls of it! We also ordered a few bottles of soju. Each AYCE patron can get one order of mochi ice cream.   The waiters are all very attentive. They check on your table often and will change your grill as many times as you ask.  The place is pretty small, but very cute. They have space under the chairs for bags, jackets, etc - very helpful! I love that this place is so close to home, so I don't have to drive far to get my fix.   From the outside and the location you can't tell how trendy this place is, but it's definitely somewhere you can take friends/family/visitors."}
