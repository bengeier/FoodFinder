{"text":"Today's experience at breakfast doesn't qualify for even a half star but more like negative stars (but yelp requires a star rating). 

There were 5 of us for our table. One plate came out 30 minutes after ordering and with moldy toast. Gross!!! 

The rest of the meals weren't started, so we waited an additional 15 minutes for our meals. We asked for mayo and the comment from the owner that \"that's disgusting\" was heard throughout the restaurant.

When we first arrived, there was no communication of an issue and meals were slow coming out. There was no compensation or effort to make things right.

We've worked in full service restaurants before and know the routine. Unfortunately for this one, we will take our business elsewhere. 

A disappointed customer with a lost appetite!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for a relaxed breakfast, it's like visiting grandmas house. The coffee was great, eggs and home fries were done perfectly and it was run by two sweet older women which added to the overall experience"}
{"text":"Worst experience I have had in a long time. We waited over 1.5 hours for our food. During that wait time, we saw numerous other diners receive the wrong food, have to ask for silverware multiple times before receiving any,  all while the waitress kept bumping into me when she walked by me. 
We finally got up and left before we ever got served when the waitress brought out her friend's food when he showed up 45 minutes after us. 
We will never go there again."}
{"text":"2 waitresses on a Sunday = frustrating experience. Food was good, but I could go to store, make at home and clean up and be relaxing in the time it took at this place :("}
{"text":"We gave it a try after passing it for years. I ordered a ham and cheese omelet. It was the saltiest omelet ever in the entire world! Everything else in our breakfast was nothing short of mediocre."}
{"text":"It's a cute little diner with great service! We ate breakfast there and it was delicious. I recommend the breakfast burrito!"}
{"text":"Michelle also does lunch and dinner and ribs on the weekends (during the summer) but my review will focus on the breakfast special; meat, eggs, home fries, toast for about $5.  I've eaten lots and lots of breakfast specials in my time.  This is among the best.  Michelle's home fries are probably the best I've had.  Bacon is better than average, eggs are always moist.  

Service is always friendly.  Ambiance is typical small town diner...which is to say, just fine."}
{"text":"Got there when they first opened on Sunday.  Only had one server, older gentleman who wasn't very pleasant.  Not sure if it was the early morning or the first thing in the morning rush!  The food was average, you do get a lot for the money."}
{"text":"If by \"home style\" you mean slow service, cold plates for warn eggs, and a lackluster flavor? Then I would give this five stars!! Steer the ship into an iceberg instead. You'll get better results."}
{"text":"Just tried this place out this morning for the first time. It may not be the most modern up to date decor but what makes it so special is the fantastic service!! My husband and I both ordered the daily breakfast special and it was delicious- too much food for me which is always nice because you know the value is superb!! The cook is a wonderfully warm woman who took a brief moment to come out and chit chat. She's a doll!! We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Good solid breakfast, great service the past few times after having poor service a couple years ago. Clean. Convenient to get in and out quick."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a negative star review, I would. I'm sitting in another restaurant writing this review because I never got my food at Michelle's Place, and we followed another group of people out the door & watched them flip over the closed sign in the window 2 hours early. We got there at 11 am & walked out at noon having been served drinks only. We were told that there was a family fued in the kitchen. The place had a lot of tables filled & we only ever saw one other table get food & they sent some of it back. The waitress we had couldn't keep her hands off of her face or out of her hair. She was very apologetic when we were all walking out though. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Home style meals at a great price. Michele's Place is a perfect small town Mayberry kind of diner where you can get great food and it won't hurt your pockets. The homefries are amazing, and probably the best I've ever had at a restaurant."}
{"text":"I thought it was a very special spot. They have no wi-fi , but seems to give a retro feel like the good old days. The food is o.k., and service the same."}
{"text":"Food was okay. But okay as in the fact that breakfast foods can't actually be bad. Service was terrible. Waiting for everything all the time. Took 20 minutes just to get our check."}
{"text":"Good small place. I had a chicken philly with french fries. Saw other reviews that mentioned big portions. Fries were a really good size and the sandwich was about 6 inches and just warm. Ketchup is kept in the cooler as a heads up. My other got 2 pancakes, 2 overhard eggs, and bacon. Eggs were as should be, bacon was soggy, and the pancakes took up the whole plate and flavorful but not fluffy. Overall, a decent breakfast place right off of the square. Would consider coming back."}
{"text":"Breakfast is delicious!  Home cooked food that tastes like \"Mom\" did the cooking.  Try the gyro omelet and pancakes!"}
