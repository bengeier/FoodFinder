{"text":"Perfect portion size Perfect amount of cheese  The owner is really friendly  Amazing french fries   I initially came here because of the groupon but I would definitely return!!"}
{"text":"Wow!  I had their special as a combo with a tornado fries and a coffee and oh God every one of them was better than the other! Pizza is really flavourful and filling. Really great customer service. It took them about 5 to 10 min to make it and cost me a little less than $11 for all that food! Definitely something I would recommend."}
{"text":"Awesome spot for pizza wings and sandwich. Some of my favorite chicken wings and very tasty Persian Pizza."}
{"text":"Came here today for the first time. It was busy (being a Saturday afternoon). We thought the concept of a pizza cone was interesting and wanted to check it out. Our order took 8-10 minutes, just like a regular pizza order would take at any pizza joint. We bought one cheese cone and one yummy cone special. Regular price for each was $5.30 but we had a groupon for $10 worth of food for $6.   Service: fast and friendly servers.   Environment: small eatery but very clean.   Food: food was hot and tasted ... just like pizza, but in a cone shape! It was good but not very filling if you're that type of person that eats at least 2 slices of pizza. I'd compare one yummy cone to one packed slice of pizza. It was more oily to me than eating a regular style pizza. It's a nice concept for those who like a new spin on traditional food but I would stick with regular style pizza. It is a bit pricey for one cone (which is why I would not go back without a groupon).   Overall, it's a good place to eat. If you want to try something new, I would recommend. But for the price, I'd rather buy a whole pizza."}
{"text":"We were so excited to try this unique concept and it was excellent!!! We had the pizza cones and they were yummy!  We also had the fries and tornado fries...both were great. We tried the pizza and the crust was so delicious and crisp. And we had the mild wings and they were so great that we were sorry that we had only ordered 1 pound. The owner was so nice and friendly. We WILL DEFINITELY  be going back really soon. You should try this place out...you'll be very happy you did!"}
{"text":"Went with my daughter (4 years old) and my mom and all three of us loved it! More \"toppings\" than expected and the owner is super duper nice!! Will definitely be bringing my son to try it too! So cool!"}
{"text":"Interesting concept ! The cones are on the smaller side. I ordered the meat lover cone and found it a little too salty. But my boyfriend got the spicy chicken one and it was the right amount of chicken & veggies. We also ordered a poutine to share, and it was huge !   They also have fresh pizzas made to order. Will definitely be back to try that next time.   I found the decor to be a little out of the place. But they do have a few tables in the restaurant for dine in."}
{"text":"I had a groupon for this place; the concept seemed interesting and reviews here were good so I decided to try it out.   Upon entering, the place is very small so any more than 5 people would feel crowded. No biggie, since it seems like this place caters much to takeout and ubereats orders. Customer service kind of sucked; the guy was just there to take your order and give you your food. Also not a huge deal for me since I got my food to go (I got a Hot & Spicy Chicken pizza cone and an order of Tornado Fries). However, I will say something smelled oddly like dog food when I got my order...  Tornado fries: 1/5 These tasted like burnt chips cooked in old oil. Coated with a dust of Parmesan cheese, but the potato itself wasn't seasoned. Overall, very bland and any taste of potato or cheese was covered by the burnt taste. One point for it being a potato though.  Hot & Spicy Chicken cone: 4/5 I liked the stuffing. It was packed over the top of the cone and ingredients tasted fresh and the chicken was moist. The crust was okay; I found it the slightest bit too chewy for my taste.  Overall: 3/5 Honestly, the whole experience was nothing special. I doubt I would return."}
{"text":"I have tried a combo, salad & sandwich. All food is good. Boss & staff are courteous and friendly"}
{"text":"Came here with a Groupon $12 for two Groupons worth $10 each.   Pros Made fairly fresh  Good service  Tastes good (well like any other pizza)   Cons Long wait for food (12 min)  Place gets very crowded at times (there are only 3 tables."}
{"text":"Overall - 2.5/5.0  Noticed quite a few food bloggers praising about this place and recently they have promoted their hot sandwiches on Instagram. It looked pretty darn good so I decided to give it a try. However it was underwhelming and definitely did not deserve the praise it received.  I ordered the turkey sandwich and apparently they use an 'award winning' bread from Bagel Nash (which I do not see any references about it being award winning when I googled it) as their base.  Bread - Texture was slightly dense and doughy. It held the toppings together without leaking all over the place but lacked the chewiness of a good baguette style bread and light crispness that you would expect after toasting it in the oven. Definitely not 'award winning' by any means.  Toppings - The turkey deli slices were a bit too salty. The rest of the toppings were not bad and laid out in the sandwich in an orderly fashion.  Looked at some of the folks who ordered the pizza cone while I was there and boy was it small for the price. It seemed like a gimmicky item to me that totally lacked any appeal to me."}
{"text":"Been excited to try this place. Showed up yesterday at 7pm and it was closed although they were supposed to be open until 10pm. Will have to call ahead next time I guess."}
{"text":"Placed an order for delivery. Was really excited to try this place out. Food had not come an hour and a half later so I called the restaurant. They didn't have 2/3 of the items that I ordered. Didn't feel like placing another order since it was already 1.5 hours later and I did not want to wait another hour for delivery. Ended up cancelling. Should have at least let me know when they got the order."}
{"text":"Only decided to try this place out because of a Groupon. Came here expecting some novelty and perhaps a \"wow factor\" that would make these pizza cones more appealing than a regular slice of pizza but nope - there was nothing special about it. Mediocre at best. The cone crust was crunchier/harder than expected and there was more cheese than toppings.   In grade 3 power writing style, here's the breakdown: Firstly, it took equally as long (if not longer) as a regular pizza for my cone to be made. With no other customers, my order took 15-20 minutes. This isn't the fault of the owner though, just a flaw of the nature of the business. Secondly, one portion size wasn't filling. As I watched the owner make my cone, I noticed there was a lot of food waste because all the toppings kept falling out. Unlike a flat slice of pizza, the surface area of a cone is drastically reduced. Thirdly, the amount that this place charges is not worth it. Running at prices slightly more expensive than regular pizza, I would not come back."}
{"text":"I like the concept of a pizza cone! A combo comes with your choice of pizza cone + drink + fries or onion rings. You can upgrade to tornado fries.   The combo would fill you up. The tiny cone is packed with ingredients and flavours. They are made fresh, so you may have to wait a bit for your food.   I tried the tornado fries, it's alright. I haven't tried their pizza or wings or sandwiches, but I feel like I can probably get just as good if not better pizza/sandwiches elsewhere. Their pizza cone is a unique idea and I would come back for more yummy cones."}
{"text":"Great value, food and service. Cute lil spot, very clean. Not much space inside as it fills up fast. Overall would definetly come back. Lots of bariety for the pizza cones."}
{"text":"Their pizza cones caught my eyes ever since the first time I saw a picture of it on Instagram. I didn't pay much attention to them at first until more and more pictures of them started appearing on my feed. I've got to admit, making a pizza into a cone is a really unique concept because eating pizza can sometimes get really messy.   Anyhow, I went for a visit with a Groupon deal. My first impression of Yummy Cone was that the place was really small, had limited seats, and the layout of it was a little bit awkward (maybe because I was the only one in the restaurant at the time). I ordered the Yummy Cone Special with Tornado Fries and a drink. The Yummy Cone Special is made with pepperoni, bacon, sausage, green peppers, red peppers, hot banana peppers, mushrooms, cheddar & mozzarella cheese. The food is freshly made with each order, which also meant the waiting time is a little longer than usual.   The size of the pizza cone was relatively small. You definitely can't have this as a meal, only as a snack. However, the taste was actually pretty good, I'd say even better than most of the big pizza chains out there. There were a lot of toppings inside the cone, probably twice the amount of toppings you would get on a regular pizza slice. Surprisingly, the cone did not get soggy and remained crispy throughout. However, I was a little disappointed with the Tornado Fries because it was over-cooked to the point where most part of it was black. Every bite of it was bitter.  Next time I visit Yummy Cone, I will probably try their poutine since it was recommended by one of their staffs. Nonetheless, it was a great experience and perfect for an \"on the go\" snack."}
{"text":"There are no surprises here- it tastes just like pizza, just in a cone shape and without tomato sauce. I don't particularly like tomato sauce too much anyway, so that was a plus for me! I liked how the cone was not greasy, and it didn't become soggy, but remained crispy. It also wasn't messy to eat, unlike burritos or tacos, probably because the cheese held all the ingredients together. They put a LOT of cheese in it- if you're not a huge fan of cheese, you probably wouldn't like it too much.   The portion size is quite small; don't expect to be full from just the cone. I got the yummy cone special combo with tornado fries, and that along with the drink are likely what filled me up. My friend ordered the hot & spicy chicken combo with onion rings. He got a large amount of onion rings, and they weren't over-battered nor over-deep-fried. For an extra $3, I think it's worth getting a combo.   For a meal that's more like fast-food, the wait time was way too long. It took 13 minutes for us to get our food after ordering! I guess that's why they ask if you'd want your side before the cone or at the same time.  We also got tricked by Groupon's wording. :( $12 for 2 groupons, worth $10 each. It's $10 per two people (despite the small print stating \"limit one per person\"). So you can't use two $10 groupons in one visit with two people. I guess I will have to be back, now that I have another groupon to use up."}
{"text":"This place is definitely reminding me of pizza places in Iran with yummy pizza. Their customer service is great and they are super polite.  Hope it has better parking area but don't mind because I will go back there again :))"}
{"text":"the pizza cones has a great amount of filling, it looks small but very filling. the cone is a but too crunchy and less soft like actual pizza crust, but I don't mind.  the tornado fries is so yummy, Crispy exterior with a chewy centre. The onion rings are big with a very nice crunchy shell.   Staff was very friendly, didn't rush us or anything, we paid after we were finished eating.  there are 3 bar tables with 4 chairs each. tastes better dined in.   check-in on the yelp app for a discount!"}
{"text":"TL;DR Pizza cone was cold in the middle! A small cone for $$. Wouldn't go back without a Groupon.  Saw a Groupon for this place, and I thought that the idea of pizza in a cone was worth a try, so I checked it out today. And also because the business is \"Hot and New\".  Came here around 6:30PM and the place was empty. The guy at the shop seemed like he has been sitting there for a while and smiled finally when a customer came in.  We had a Groupon for $10 worth of food for $6. My BF got their Yummy Cone Special (he requested extra spicy) with onion rings combo. I got myself a Canadian pizza cone with no mushrooms.  Contrary to other reviews the wait wasn't long at all. Took only 5-8 mins for both orders to be completed. We got the onion rings first to eat, and I was surprised at how small the serving was for the onion rings. Well, it was a side, but still very disappointing amount of onion rings.  Pizza cone is NOT large, okay? It is a rather small amount, so don't expect huge servings in this place at all.  The Yummy Cone we ordered wasn't really spicy, though my BF requested it to be spicy. It's just okay, but for $5.30 I wish the size was bigger.  I can say the same for the Canadian cone, it was packed with ingredients, but I was disappointed as I reached the middle part, it was COLD!! They did not prepare the food properly! Well, that was a let-down......  I would go back just because I have another Groupon, but I will not be coming back for any other reason. I don't know if this place gets really busy, but when we went it seemed like it has been a slow, slow day all day for them and we were the first customers for a long while.  Review 55 of 100"}
{"text":"This place is nicely located at World on Yonge (yonge/steeles), with ample free parking above ground and underground. They are also available on uber eats, which delivers to your doorstep. We were greeted with friendly service, countertop was clean, only a few tables but there is public seating outside during the summer. In terms of pricing, their combos are very reasonable, $8.99 for a pizza cone combo (with fries & drink), $2 additonal to poutine the fries. Poutine was amazing at a large portion, pizza cone's crust was cruchy and delicious. Not too greasy and it was made  to order. Will definitely come again to try out their warm sandwiches. Open till 10pm on most days."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with my bf on a Friday night. We both got a pizza cone combo with an upgrade of tornado fries. The staff were super nice and friendly. There's seating inside but it's a bit limited. Luckily there's plenty of outdoor seating in the plaza. The concept is pretty unique, it's the first pizza cone I had so I wasn't sure what to expect. I got the Hawaiian pizza cone, as I'm a big fan of pineapple. I wasn't disappointed, there's plenty of pineapples, ham and cheese! The cone was pretty much what I expected, pizza in the form of a cone minus the tomato sauce and plus lots more cheese. My bf got the spicy chicken pizza cone which had plenty of peppers, and wasn't super spicy. They do offer Parmesan cheese as a topping for their tornado fries which was a plus."}
{"text":"First time here and will definitely go back! Clever twist on pizza and tasted great! Also tried their tornado another great twist on fries. Nice people as well, was a great lunch"}
{"text":"Great service but not worth it! It's super small come and mostly filled with cheese. The flavour is also extremely lacking. We got both the veggie and the spicy chicken and both were very bland. It's mostly just a cool concept. If you're going to go get the groupon."}
{"text":"Came here looking for a quick bite since I needed to be somewhere fast and I ordered the combo with tornado fries and a meat lovers combo.  The fries is actually a potato that's been spiraled out and fried and it is delicious.  The cone itself is like a thin crunch crust pizza filled with pizza toppings and it was delicious.  Owner is really nice.  Highly recommend when you have a pizza craving."}
{"text":"Love their unique twist on pizza. Easy to eat and love that there's more filling. All the flavours I've tried are really good. But if you like a traditional pizza they offer Persian style pizza which is equally good and served with a thin crust. I heard they just released Persian style sandwiches, cannot wait to try. Finish your meal with a yummy frozen yogurt!"}
{"text":"I thought this place had interesting concept so I got their Groupon deal (Pretty much half price deal). They stuff toppings (usually there are 6+ toppings) in a cone made out of pizza crust. Bottom of the cone is usually filled with tomato sauce and top part is filled with toppings. The service is a bit slow since they need to stuff toppings 1 by 1, then bake it.  I felt eating pizza this way is more enjoyable than traditional pizza since you get to enjoy more toppings than pizza crusts.  Price was fair (maybe a little pricy), a combo got me full.  I will definitely come back for this place."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza cone. Unique idea & the poutine is excellent. Small store with limited seating however it is a must try. The customer service is fantastic and the owner is extremely friendly."}
{"text":"What a huge disappointment.. They were closed today but their opening hours said they opens everyday... I guess next time it's best to call prior."}
{"text":"Friendly service, great product. This is a franchise from the US. I didnt think I was going to like it - my bf REALLY wanted to come here.. it was a lot better than what I expected. The outer shell is a pre-made, thin and crunchy crust texture. There is no doughy texture as in a pizza, which makes a lot more room for the actual filling of meat and veges. Great for a snack or light meal. The yummy special is quite yummy! Lots of cheese. Banana peppers are not meant to be spicy. Our cones were hot and cheese-melty all the way through to the tip. Not messy at all to eat. Packaged very nicely. A few comfortable high tables and seats if you want to stay to eat. Im personally not a fan of the tornado chips, parmesan was all at the bottom of the tray so the chip tasted bland.. I think some spicy seasoning would make it nicer."}
{"text":"Cute little spot for a quick snack. The front of the store is what caught my eye and decided to go in and check it out. We had the pizza cones which were stuffed freshly in front of our eyes, but they were much smaller than I had expected. Overall, it was ok. A cute snack to try for sure but I think I'll stick with my regular pizza which they also make pan pizzas if you want something more traditional. Would recommend if you're looking for something new to try!"}
{"text":"The middle of the cone was cold and took a long time to make. Also, the entire place smelled like smoke and ruined the entire experience. The cones are too small for the price and will definitely not fill you up by itself. It's a great concept but not well executed."}
{"text":"Awesome place, staff is nice, food is delicious, and customizable, and they have great fries.   The whole pizza in a cone idea is wonderful as well, a much nicer way to eat everyone's favourite food!"}
{"text":"Yummy Cone sprang up only a couple of months ago. I saw it on Groupon and decided to try it out because it was close to home. The Groupon was $12 for $20 worth of food ($10 per visit) and you can select anything on their menu except for coffee.  I went on a Saturday afternoon. The place is small, but clean. Seating is limited. You can always get take out and have your meal on the bench, under the sun. They pack your cone in a very cute box that has a handle at the top for portability.  We ordered the Yummy Cone Special and the Hot & Spicy Chicken. They are both delicious, but I prefer the Yummy Cone. I expected the cone to be similar to a slice of pizza. I was wrong. The toppings, or stuffing in this case, filled up the entire volume of the cone. There was stuffing til the very last bite. Also, because the crust is in the shape of a cone, more surface area is exposed to the heat in the oven, making it very crunchy. My review is starting to sound like solution to a math problem.  Anyways, the wait time was only 8 mins for both cones. If you want a quick, fun and yummy meal, Yummy Cone is definitely a good choice. I will definitely go back to try the other items on their menu."}
{"text":"Heard about this place and wanted to give it a try. I remember having it at CNE before but never seen it again.   Yummy cone special ($5.30) Originally I thought it would be like a gimmick but surprisingly it tasted really good. The cone was the pizza crust, and inside was stuffed and loaded with a lot of ingredients, including pepperoni, bacon, sausage, green and red peppers, mushroom, and cheddar and mozzarella cheese. It was baked on the spot so served nice and hot - best to eat it right away while the cheese is still oosey and stretchy, and the cone crust still crispy, adding a nice crunch. Quite filling with all the ingredients. My only thought was it was missing pizza sauce to make it seem more like a pizza. Its $8.10 if you want the combo with a drink and fries.  The owner was really nice and outgoing. He even offered me to try his new frozen yogurt for free!"}
{"text":"Such an amazing offering. If you like me, love pizza but not the mess that comes with it, this is the place to go.   Service is super friendly and the value proposition is amazing too. Add that with great flavours and ample of cheese, this is a must-visit destination for any food lover"}
{"text":"Decided to go here because of the hype surrounding the whole 'pizza cone' thing.  Food: Overall, not bad. good price, a lot of options and ingredients for each cone. I ordered 2 meat lovers cones, while my mother got the pepperoni cone. I was a little underwhelmed due to the fact that the ingredients seemed frozen, not fresh. I even found some hot dog bits in my cone that tasted like a corn dog you would by in the freezer section of your grocery store. The cone and cheese were very good, but it did not live up to the whole 'pizza cone' hype.  Location: Seats 7, which is small but this seems like more of a fast-food/take out restaurant due to the convenience of the box that holds all the food. The location had some parking, but with the mall and grocery store near by, it gets crowded very quickly.  Overall, the food was decent, but not impressed to a point where I NEED this all the time.  3 burps out of 5."}
{"text":"Yummy Cone is a really cool concept, but don't come here expecting to be amazed by the quality of the actual ingredients.   I had the vegetarian pizza cone. The dish is designed really well. The actual pizza cone itself is surprisingly stable, and the melted cheese puts a nice finish on top of all the pizza topping stuffing within the cone.   I thoroughly enjoyed the experience of eating the pizza, but I can't say the same for the flavours. To me, the pizza was kind of bland. There wasn't enough tomato sauce, or italian seasonings that made me want to go back for more. It's fundamentally a bunch of raw vegetables stuffed into a pizza dough cone with cheese added on top. Simple but not fantastic.  Overall, give this place a try. Don't be surprised if you like good ol' pizza pizza more though."}
{"text":"A cozy fast food store with a personal touch of the owner which results in a whole new unique way of tasting food items you have became so accustomed to. Their spin on pizza, sandwiches and their signature cone pizza are all freshly made and full of taste and flavours. Lets put it this way, if you're bored with conventional pizza and are curious to try out something new hit them up and get anything from their menu, you'll like it... ALOT!  LOVE their yummy   Prices are very reasonable for the quality and they customize your pizza, bring your own cheese if you're lactose intolerant and you got a sick pizza with your own cheese.  Their espresso machine is very sick... Smooth stuff.. Must try."}
{"text":"This is honestly one of the most delicious and unique things I have tasted in Toronto. Going in, I had no idea what to expect. The concept may be foreign to some, but if you like pizza, you will love this. They were very generous with the toppings, and the cone itself was incredible. Prices are reasonable, and the service is great. Make the drive out to Thornhill, the experience is worth it!"}
{"text":"Went there at 9pm on Wednesday. They were closed but there sign says they open till 10pm. Google says this place closed down. Anyone know if that is true?"}
{"text":"If you're a total diehard pizza-loving fan, this place is worth checking out for their pizza cones; a totally fun and interesting take on pizza. If pizza isn't your thing, they also serve cold & hot sandwiches, poutine or tornado fries. A great spot to grab some lunch with a few hungry colleagues/co-workers, and did I mention the staff were super friendly?"}
{"text":"Good service, you pay after eating. Creative idea with pizza cone, got BBQ chicken and Hawaiian. Was a little cold in the middle, but delicious anyways! Onion rings are solid too. Limited seating, around 3 tables."}
