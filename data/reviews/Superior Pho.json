{"text":"In LA/Orange County, this would be a two-star spot at best. But seeing that we're in Cleveland, Superior Pho deserves a bit of grade inflation."}
{"text":"We're Vietnamese and this is our go-to pho restaurant when mom is not making her pho and we need a good pho fix (no pho is as good as made at home, but this is reasonably good and a good alternative).    The broth is delicately beefy, great cuts of tender beef and great noodle texture.  I always get a combo with the \"goi\" which is a cabbage slaw with shredded white meat chicken and a vinegar/sugar dressing.  It's really refreshing and balances out the heaviness of the beef in the pho.  I also like their thit nuong (grilled pork) over rice ... it's tender and tastes grilled - just like grilled pork is supposed to be done.  We pretty much just order those three items ... but I've had some other dishes there too most are pretty good - but we just go there for these staples."}
{"text":"Just delicious. Everything was fantastic. We had large pho tai and both spring rolls and fried pork rolls. I had to force myself to stop eating. If you are an out of towner like us...make sure you go to the right place. There are several Pho restaurants on the block. You can only get to Superior Pho by going around the back of the building to park."}
{"text":"It has been almost 2 years since I have dined here. Not my favorite place since they charged extra tip on my boyfriends bill, but forgive and forget?   I guess I forgave them because I dined here twice in one week! Both times to catch up with some friends. I had combo #8. Noodles were not bad, but the soup was somewhat bland. Maybe because it was 1 hour until closing?    The second visit I decided to try their bubble tea, but disappointed again because they ran out of the lychee jelly. The Taro bubble tea was ok.   Maybe I need to rekindle my relationship with Superior Pho, by actually eating a bowl of pho at my next visit...which hopefully will not be 2 years from now."}
{"text":"I ate dinner here with a friend. We've both had pho before at different restaurants around the country, some good some not so good. I must say the pho here was pretty good. I also had a bubble tea, it was also good. I'd probably recommend this restaurant to anyone who would like to try a bowl of pho."}
{"text":"Every time I am in the Cleve I make it a point to come here. We have tons of really great Pho spots in Chicago - but I've been consistently wowed every time I've been here."}
{"text":"Delicious comfort food. Whenever I'm in Asiatown to stock up on groceries and baked goodies, I make an effort to come here for lunch. I come mostly for the vermicelli noodles or the broken rice dishes even though their specialty is pho. (I am really not a pho fan.)  I've been coming here since I was a student because their prices are reasonable. The service is also efficient.  So if you're going to pay with cash, leave the tip first. Otherwise, if you use the singles from that $20, you table will have been cleared and maybe even seated by the time you finish with the cashier (who is equally efficient)."}
{"text":"I'd actually give this place 3.5 stars.  But since I can't and I've definitely had better pho, I'm going to have to go 3 stars.  Pho - broth wasn't that flavorful, noodles and meat were good.  Banh Mi - not the usual bread, but good french bread, so I'm not complaining.  overall, just an ok banh mi.  Fried spring roll - pretty good, but realllly greasy.  picked it up for 2 secs and after putting it down, my fingers were soo shiny!  Service - above average for an asian restaurant and the owner was super friendly."}
{"text":"Thus is the best place in Cleveland to get pho hands down. In my opinion it is better than the place that is right next to it.  The soup is authentic tasting and the noodles and meat are done right. The food is also pretty cheap.   When you go, you definitely want to make sire that you get the sandwich because it is seriously one of the best tasting sandwiches that you will ever find. They do an amazing job toasting the sandwich and it comes out looking delectable.  One thing to note is that this place is CLOSED on Mondays."}
{"text":"I don't really understand why this place is so highly rated. The food was mediocore. The pho tasted alright, but the grilled pork was sub-par. Was not impressed with banh mi, did not like it at all. This place should not have such a high rating."}
{"text":"I have been a repeat customer for more than 10 years. It used to be called Pho Hoa but has had one owner and always excellent food. Over the ten years I have tried about everything. Manh Nguyen gets his ingredients fresh every day. If it is your first time, try the No. 1 or 2 Pho. It is as good as anything in San Francisco or Vietnam for that matter.   Always reasonable and always fast. I recently had a business meeting with about 20 people. We got our own room and the bill came to less than $500.   Don't miss this Cleveland gem."}
{"text":"All I can is WOW! The Pho is great. I mean the meat , vegetables and noodles are prepared to perfection, and in combination is very good. And Oh Yeah, the price is very reasonable as well. Check it out soon!"}
{"text":"Let me start with the spring rolls. Definitely get the spring rolls. You only get two with some sweet and sour sauce, but they feel very fresh when you bite them - you can just hear the crunch of the vegetables and peanuts. A perfect appetizer to your pho noodles.  The pho itself is delicious. I came on a hot summer day but I still felt refreshed after. The soup is very good and the noodles are cooked very well. I am a huge fan of the bean sprouts, basil, and jalapeno peppers they give you to eat with your meal. I also love that brown sauce, not sure what it is, that they give you to dip your meat in. I got a large and probably didn't have to eat the whole rest of the day. The portions are great.   It was sweet that the waitress knew my uncle's family and noticed that one of the kids wasn't there!   IS IT CHEAP? A large bowl of the first pho on the menu is around $8 and a smaller bowl is around $7. So YES!"}
{"text":"Best Pho in cleveland.  Don't let the run-down strip mall decor or the backside parking lot scare you away.  This is a great place to get a pho with a good broth on a cold day."}
{"text":"After spending years in a Chicago it has been difficult to find delicious authentic pho and Banh mi.  Superior grill was delicious and it's located in a charming spot.  Tried Saigon grill weeks prior and was extremely disappointed.  They don't make authentic Banh mi. To be frank it was dry and the meat tasted off.  I highly recommend this place if you love good Vietnamese cuisine.  Great friendly service too."}
{"text":"Much, much better than I expected. One of the most popular pho places in  the Cleveland area. Would recommend highly!"}
{"text":"Found this Vietnamese place on yelp and decided to go there for a take out.  I ordered number 1 pho for 8.95 and a durian bubble tea.  Comparing pho in NY and NJ, the place, prices on the menu ate kind a high.  But, this amount, they give you a big portion for takeout pho.  Tons of meat and lots of noodles.  Wish they have small size for take out.  The durian bubble tea is perfectly good.  Very strong durian taste.  Must try if you like durian.  I would highly recommend this place if you are looking for a real pho."}
{"text":"I've been here only a handful of times and their #10 combo meal is one of the best values for a meal around.  The Vietnamese sandwich and large Pho meal will definitely not leave you hungry.  The Pho broth is very good and flavorful.  It needs very little additions.  The sandwich is also pretty good...the bread definitely makes it.  I've since moved away but every time I'm in Cleveland, I try to swing by.  12 bucks for a hot lunch that isn't too heavy but filling is a great deal.  It's quick too as sit down restaurants go so it's a great lunch spot."}
{"text":"The best pho in town, hands down. The only bad thing I can say is that they are closed on Mondays. If you forget that and head over on Monday, you will be sad to have to settle for other, less superior, pho."}
{"text":"Great pho, awesome meat portions, good service but they use too much powder as you leave soooo thirsty!"}
{"text":"Like Tina Turner sang, this place is \"simply the best, better than all the rest.\"  I eat here once a week because it's the best pho and bahn mi in Cleveland/Ohio/west of DC and east of SF. One time I took a girl here on a date and she didn't enjoy it so I never called her again.   Superior Pho's broth is perfect and flavorful. The portions and price are fantastic. The atmosphere and location are part of its charm. I never leave unhappy - except for that brief bit of sadness that accompanies my empty pho bowl. Hands down my favorite restaurant in Cleveland."}
{"text":"The restaurant decor is not impressive, but who cares.  This is the best restaurant for pho in Cleveland.  The broth is oh so tasty.  Their bahn mi and fried spring rolls are good as well.  The owner sits at a table drinking wine.  It's a hoot.  I get the #14- there is no meat.  I love this place."}
{"text":"This is truly a Cleveland treasure.  When I moved to Ohio, I had little hope of ever finding decent pho within several hundred miles.  My birthday rolled around and I wanted pho, so we decided to try this place.  So glad we did.  So so so thankful.    It's a literal hole in the wall. The sign on the front is super tiny. You probably won't see it. It's across the street from a big, flashy pho place that isn't nearly as good, but easy to mistake.  Parking is in the back.  I just get the plain pho with no meat.  It comes with a big tray of mung bean sprouts, basil, and jalapenos.  Adding sriracha does not cover the broth's beautiful flavor.  It's simply exquisite.  It's very inexpensive and so delicious.  Accept no substitutes.  This pho is superior."}
{"text":"Great food and nice atmosphere. I am not an expert in vietnamese food, but I loved their pho. I will definitely go back next time I am in Cleveland. The only drawback is the neighbourhood which is not great."}
{"text":"Growing up in Seattle and then going to Los Angeles, I think I can confidently say I've had some of the best pho in the states. My expectations were high, but Superior Pho definitely met them! Everything from the broth to the meat and noodles was just right. I'm really happy to have found such a good pho place in Cleveland. The only complaint I would have is that they don't have tendon, but I understand that might be more difficult to acquire that here compared to the west coast. A must try if you like pho!"}
{"text":"You are not paying for location. You are not paying for ambiance. You are paying a small price for big flavor and good service. You cannot go wrong with the pho, but the broken rice dishes are equally outstanding."}
{"text":"Coming from Dallas ,  this place is about the next best thing to home. The pho base is good and price is perfect compare to some of their local competitors."}
{"text":"Everyone know that the \"the King\" of basketball, LeBron James plays in Cleveland and the city is grateful to have him. Someone a little less known among Clevelanders but not any less talented is the owner of Superior Pho--my self-proclaimed \"King of Pho.\"    I have eaten pho from Toronto, Montreal, New York, Columbus and I have to say that nothing else compares to Superior Pho. The broth here is light and clear yet full of rich flavor. It's clean with no single taste overwhelming the others. The noodles are chewy yet firm.   The service here is also great. The pho usually comes out within three minutes of ordering. Whenever my eating buddy gets the pho, she always ask for more basil leaves and jalapeño peppers, which she receives quickly without fail. The banh mi is also the best in the city, thanks to the crispy french bread they use. It takes more time than the pho, around 10 minutes, but it's worth it. The vermicelli noodle dishes: pickled vegetables, noodles and basil with a side bowl of fish sauce are also a good change of pace for when it's too hot to eat pho.   Bottom Line: Pho King Great"}
{"text":"Recently moved to the area. After eating here, we don't really feel the need to look anywhere else for good pho. Prices are good. Service is quick. Not swanky but as good as any other hole-in-the-wall pho shop in places with much bigger Vietnamese populations. Thank goodness."}
{"text":"Oh my damn. This is officially the best pho I've ever had. I'm not an expert by any means but I am definitely a pho fan. I've had it enough to know what's good. I love the pho at Bac but I have to admit that it doesn't live up to the bowl of heaven I had at Superior Pho. Let me tell ya what sets it apart:   I've only ever had pho with eye round but during my visit I opted for the brisket. I had heard tales of it's tender, beefy glory and it totally lived up to the hype. It's incredibly tender and falls apart with the touch of a chop stick. What really puts it over the top is the depth of flavor in the broth. You get salty, beefy and star anise all in one brothy bite. Then you add sriracha, basil, jalapeño slices and lemon to the party and things get crazy. We washed ours down with a mango bubble tea. It's basically a mango slushy with large tapioca balls at the bottom. The sweet mango and the savory pho are the perfect marriage and helps dull the sriracha burn.   The portion sizes here are extremely generous and you get a lot of bang for your buck. I ordered the small, ate half and took the rest home. I think my bowl was around $8 and I got two meals out of it. Where else can you get that kind of a deal??   My pho cravings strike pretty often so I know that Superior Pho and I will soon be well acquainted. If you want the best pho in Cleveland, this is your spot!"}
{"text":"THe worst pho i have ever tried and also worst service  restaurant smells really bad and pho was not hot enough so noodle was even hard to chew   i will never be going back to superior pho"}
{"text":"I recently became obsessed with pho and knew I had to try Superior Pho ASAP. It was good, but nothing spectacular. (But I also find all pho to taste relatively the same so.....)  The sauce served with the summer rolls was way too peanut-y. It looked like peanut butter and was much thicker than peanut sauce should be.   ** Two thumbs up for the Vietnamese iced coffee. It's thick, strong, and delicious. A must try for any coffee fanatic."}
{"text":"Best Pho/food I have eaten. I go here every time I am back from break and get the summer rolls and number 9 or 8 and it is the best comfort food on earth. There is not much room, but everyone is always accommodating and the service is good. It is also fast and easy to go in and out. I would recommend this for anyone looking for a unique and delicious place to try when visiting Cleveland."}
{"text":"Easy 5 star. One of my favorite places on earth. This is, hands down, the best Pho I have ever had in my life.  The best broth is the one that is the most transluscent. It should almost look like water. This is that type of broth. It packs so much flavor its incredible. It's fresh, flavorful, and is so satisfying. Just the smells alone are worth the price.  Go here, and don't stop coming back."}
{"text":"I have been going here for several years now and it used to be Pho Hoa.  Same owner, just a name change.  The pho is intensely flavorful and has a real depth to it.  Lots of love goes into it.  The vietnamese sandwich is made with quality bread and meat and the jalapeno, cukes and other veggies add a wonderful crunch.  If you're getting the pho, get the meal that comes with the sandwich.  I never pass up the opportunity to dine here."}
{"text":"Service was horrible. Food was bland. Ordered a sandwich and it never came out. Never again ninh kieu and nam wah is way better."}
{"text":"If it was possible to give more then 5 stars I would. Easily the best pho in Cleveland perhaps in ohio. The lunch meals are fantastic due to the inclusion of a spring/summer roll plus a bowl of pho. The sandwiches are also incredible. Not to be missed!"}
{"text":"Talk about a \"little, out of the way place!\"    After driving through the cold, dark streets of Cleveland, I parked in a dimly lit gravel parking lot, and walked into the back of a building, down a strange hallway to get to my table.  I kept thinking it was a little like a noodle shop in \"Blade Runner,\" and I'd look over and find Deckard and Gaff chowing down on a bowl of noodles before heading out to find an escaped Nexus 6.  Anyway...We sat down and our waitress was over to our table with water almost instantly.  We browsed the menu for a second or two...but I knew there was only one thing I really wanted...a banh mi. We ordered two of them and a bo bia as an appetizer.  Within a matter of minutes, despite being a surprisingly busy Sunday night, our food appeared from the back.  The banh mi sandwich was great!  Roasted pork, pork pate, veggies, a mayonnaise sauce, fresh herbs and some unadvertised, but always welcome, hot chili peppers, all inside a perfectly crusty, 6-inch baguette.    The bo bia are rice paper rolls, with noodles, thinly sliced Chinese sausage, egg, lettuce, Thai basil, and lettuce stuffed inside.  It comes with the ubiquitous peanut dipping sauce, but it didn't really need any help in the flavor department.  Very tasty!  There was a giant bottle of Sriracha sauce on the table, but neither the sandwich nor the bo bia needed any help.    The decor was a little bright and cliche with giant, generic \"Asian-style\" fans on the walls, and a picture or two of some non-specific Asian places.  But at the end of the day...it's all about the eats...and I'm not eating the decor!    This place is really good!  I can't wait to go back and try something else on the menu, although the banh mi is going to be hard to pass up."}
{"text":"They say the 5-star rating is \"as good as it gets.\"  This is as good as it gets in Cleveland. Beats the nearby #1 Pho on flavor of broth alone, though you'd be better served to go to #1 Pho if you're taking someone out, given the decor of this place. It's simple. It's in a weird indoor strip-mall.  I've had better in other cities, but if you're in Cleveland this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Always wanted to try this place. Every time i'm in the area they are closed. But i finally got to try it. Not a let down at all. Great Pho! and wonderful staff"}
{"text":"Love this place! Been a customer for over 10 years and honestly I am still not sick of their Pho! I always get Pho #2 and paired with a little bit of Bean sprouts you've got a delicious pick me up during the cold Cleveland winters!  Service is pretty fast, the place is kind of small so sometimes on a really crowded weekend you may need to wait a bit, but it's worth the wait.   The fact that I have never gotten tired of the place despite 10 YEARS of this stuff, that says something. Give it a try if you have the chance, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Really good pho. They have a combo deal where you can get a big bowl of pho and a banh mi for pretty cheap, I usually just have them wrap up the sandwich and take it home because the pho is pretty big"}
{"text":"I'd agree that the pho at Superior Pho is better than Number One Pho and Minh-Ahn.  But, it's still not as good as pho that I've had in other cities.  The broth is still lacking a bit in flavor...maybe a bit watered down.  I had a small bowl of pho dac biet (which has everything in it).  The summer roll was blah.   I think I'll try the banh mi next time."}
{"text":"Best place for authentic Pho in Cleveland! I always get the #8 large with eye-round steak and I can never eat it all.  This stuff could grow back a limb it's so homey and delicious."}
{"text":"Alright, so today I went there and ordered a meatball pho and summer roll(the flavor of Superior Pho is not very good, however I am in Cleveland I do not have many choices). So when the waitress asked me what am I gonna order, I said pho with meatball. Then she asked is that no.14? I said no, its No.11, pho with meatball. Then when I paid check, the boss of this restaurant said the total is 24 dollars, I was like WOW how come those 2 dishes cost me 24 dollars, it must be a mistake. I asked why, and the boss said you ordered pho with extra meatball, I said I didn't order that, and then I asked waitress she said yea you ordered no.11 and you said you want pho with meatball. No.11 is already pho with meatball that means you want extra meatball!(gREAT LOGIC MATE!). I tried to argue with them, and the boss just kept saying but I still have the extra meatballs. Then here goes my 8.5$ for some worthless meatballs xD. Just gr8 stuff haha"}
{"text":"2nd time I've ordered carry out from here and both times I've been happy with my order. The first time I went, I got a bit lost trying to look for Danbury Ct (the alley directly across from the Superior exit ramp) entrance. I ordered the rice with shredded pork which comes with Superior Pho's signature sauces and it didn't seem to bother my gluten allergy at all. You can even order your bubble tea to go. On my first visit (week day 4:30PM) not many people were seated inside the restaurant, but on my more recent visit. (week day 7:00PM), the restaurant was pretty full. The restaurant itself is inside a little shopping plaza, and it's the first business closest to the back parking lot where the shopping plaza entrance is located. While I found the food good, but not spectacular, I would order from Superior Pho again."}
{"text":"Superior Pho is all about the food and the only thing missing from their pho dac biêt is the deliciousness of gan (tendon).  I was not familiar with bánh mì thit (Vietnamese sandwich) but have become a fan.  The bì cuon (spring rolls) took me back to Hue where I first experienced these refreshingly healthy rice paper creations.   Because of the subtle flavors (until the hot chili & hoisin sauces are added!), fresh ingredients and reasonable prices, Superior Pho has become my new 'comfort food' purveyor."}
{"text":"Pho is my favorite food and I wanted to find some good restaurants where pho is served. This place definitely had good pho! The bowls are large and it really fills you up. It is, however, a smaller and more crowded restaurant (and was a little tricky to find). But otherwise, I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Superior Pho has been my favorite restaurant for some time.  I've had very good pho at well-reviewed places in D.C., Houston, and San Francisco, and none of those experiences compare to the deliciousness within this tiny Cleveland restaurant.  I think the high quality meat is what makes this pho so good.  It is sliced very thinly and then allowed to cook in the hot broth.  The broth is savory, and the noodles are perfect.  The soup comes with cilantro and green onions and a large plate of fresh bean sprouts, basil, jalapenos, and lime, all of which add texture and make the flavor wonderfully complex.  Optional hoisin sauce, \"Rooster sauce,\" and fish sauce allow you to further adjust the flavor of your soup.  Other excellent items on the menu include the bun (noodles with seasoned grilled meat and veggies, huge portion yet light and refreshing), the Vietnamese sandwich, chicken + cabbage salad, and lychee bubble tea.  The owner is very nice, the guy with the glasses who asks \"How was your meal?\"  The service is very fast but not always great - Expect to ask for more water when your glass is empty.  This is a small fault compared to the cheap and unbeatable Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Went here last week when i was recuperating from a bout of cold. We went there around noon so there's a lot of people though we didnt wait long to be seated. Our server was very attentive and so was the manager.   I got a big bowl of pho for i was starving and my friend got a small one and she also ordered an extra small one to take home. The food was delivered shortly after.  Pho dac biet was heavenly!:) the hot soup with the crunchy mungbean sprouts and a slice of jalapeno to give it some kick.. it was really really good. My friend finished hers before i even get to enjoy half of mine.. she said it's because i talk mOre. I think, she just liked it a lot or was really hungry. she also used fork and while i was enjoying the full asian experience in using chopsticks!:)   i would've given them 5 stars but because i was sick and needed more TLC like for them to maybe offer to transfer my unfinished soup in  a carry out container or they could've maybe brought my friend's take out pho at the end of the meal and not with it, that would've gave them a perfect 5 stars.:) maybe next time because i'll definitely be back.:)"}
{"text":"I've heard about this place forever, but it took a friend to help me find it. I knew it was right next to #1Pho, but where? Anyway, it's across the alley from #1 Pho (on the same side of Superior) and only accessible from the back of the building.   Despite the odd location, this place was packed at lunch. And I can see why. It's the best Pho Thai I've ever had. After another visit where everything was excellent, this place gets another star. I'm out of stars now.   Oh, and everything is way more affordable than its neighbor. The only thing #1Pho has on this place is the decor. If you want to impress a date with a nice looking restaurant, then Superior Pho is slightly less than its namesake. For instance, the Bathrooms: It's clear that they are managed by the building owner, and not the restaurant, but something really needs to be done. I've been to trashed out dive bars with better bathrooms. Maybe it's time for a new location? With food like this, I'm sure us clientele will follow."}
{"text":"Growing up, I could eat three bowls of pho a day- nothing could beat mom's pho. So naturally, when I moved up to Cleveland I was in search of a pho that could rival the freshness of home-cooked pho. I typically go to Superior Pho on gloomy Cleveland days where a nice warm bowl of pho can lift my spirits. I opt for the summer roll and small bowl of Pho (#2). The cuts of beef could be more tender and the broth felt a little heavy and lacked the accents of cinnamon, star anise, and other intricate spices. But I'm not going to complain. The summer rolls are always a great starter. The small Pho is a hearty serving and nothing can beat the speediness of the service at Superior Pho.   Superior Pho fell just short of a fantastic Vietnamese meal, because nothing can beat watching your mom nurture Pho broth for five hours. Superior Pho is good, solid Pho."}
{"text":"Overpriced! Dirty smelly bathroom! Shameful! It was okay Pho and Banh Mi. Definitely not worth the $$ I paid. $4 for a small regular sandwich and $8 for regular size meatball (skimpy on meat) at a hole in the wall? No way! I've eaten at Vietnamese restaurants coast to coast and this did not live up to the reviews. Dallas/Fort Worth had the best Vietnamese and prices. Others should take notes. Maybe I expect more because I was raised with Asians and my husband is Asian."}
{"text":"Best Pho I have had in the US! I'm constantly thinking of an excuse to be on this side of town just to stop in. Keep doing what you are doing."}
{"text":"One word: AMAZING!!!  My boyfriend had been talking about this place for months now after eating lunch here and I have been dying to try it ever since!  Well, that finally happened this weekend when we were out roaming downtown for apartments, and it was everything I had imagined - and more!     The spot is small - VERY small, but cozy.  We walked in and were seated immediately and placed our orders within minutes.  I had the #3 ( Ph tái chín), which was noodles with brisket and eye-round and the bf had the #12 (Ph dc biêt), which had every meat possible.  We ordered and before I knew it, minutes later we had our food - talk about service.  The dish that comes out is very simple - noodles, broth, your meat and some herbs.  They bring out a dish with more leafy herbs (I didn't try any so I have no idea what they are), bean sprouts, and jalapenos.  There are also different sauces you can add to make the broth however hot and/or sweet you want it, but I suggest not adding too much to take away from the flavor of the dish.    I highly recommend this place - it's comfort Asian food at its best.  And don't wait to check it out - you'll kick yourself for it (I did!)"}
{"text":"I've been a regular customer of the place for almost two years. Definitely the best pho in town."}
{"text":"Six stars, if I could.  I've had the pho from just about every other place in town and there is none that is as good as this.  I've been coming here for years.  The pho is the most traditional, satisfying and consistent by far.  Its only been 18 hrs since I was there and my mouth is watering.  I've had virtually every pho they offer (and their variety is better than most) and the depth of flavor is wonderful.  My companions, if not ordering the pho, usually get the rice with smoky pork dishes.  Yum. The owners are very concerned and accommodating to your needs and want to make sure that you always enjoy your meal.   When I'm downtown and heading back to my office in the burbs, I always stop for a Bahn mi sandwich which is usually half eaten by the time I'm back at my desk.  I'm usually given a cup of tea while I wait the short time to have it prepared.  Nice touch.  You can read the same raves many many times and they are all correct.  Once you find the place (and byob, if you're so inclined) you'll certainly agree."}
{"text":"I only come here for Pho. So far I tried so many places a cross the country but there pho always the best. Never disappointed."}
{"text":"Edible but not that great. Grilled meat was re-cooked giving it an old oily flavor. Pho cooked with instant broth and not with bones. Rice was soggy."}
{"text":"This place is the perfect hole in the wall! The Pho is awesome and you can get the broth to go to start a new pot of it when you get home.  I don't live close so for me it was a plus.  Leftovers always happen so plan on it!  The Bahn mi was great too toasted to perfection  - we had leftovers from that too!!"}
{"text":"Best place to eat Pho, and even if you aren't a pho fan, then get their Bánh mì tht which is a delicious sandwich. It is difficult to find but it is well worth it. A favorite of Iron Chef Michael Symon and written about by Adam Richman (Man V. Food) in the Cleveland section of his book. Whenever I go home I make it a point to stop here, just don't get tricked into going to that other pho place :-)  http://monkeybrewster.com/wp-content/gallery/cleveland/Superior%20Pho.JPG"}
{"text":"My absolute go-to place to get my pho and bahn mi fix in Cleveland! Not sure how I haven't gotten around to reviewing this place yet!  Superior Pho definitely sets the bar high for pho. If you have been to Superior Pho and decide to try out another restaurant for pho in the Cleveland area, you will probably be disappointed (I learned that the hard way)! Their pho is always consistently prepared, with a hearty, exquisitely seasoned broth, perfectly cooked noodles, and thinly sliced beef. My usual is the #10 combination meal with a large pho, bahn mi, and drink of choice. I almost always take my leftover broth home to make noodle soup with later because of how delicious it is that I simply cannot let it go to waste. The bahn mi is equally as satisfying with just the right amounts of meat, pickled veggies, cilantro, and sliced jalapenos in a lightly toasted baguette. During the hot summer months, I like to order one of their cold vermicelli noodle bowls and have enjoyed them as well.   Service is prompt and courteous. You can easily get in and out of the restaurant within 30 minutes if you're looking to grab a quick bite. There's no waiting around for your server to deliver your check since you pay up front once you're done eating.   The only setbacks are the somewhat hard to find location for first-timers and the dark ambience, both of which I'm willing to overlook because of how good the pho is. I'll continue to be a Superior Pho customer as long as I'm living in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"I really don't know why they got 4.5 stars!...  I try 2-3 new places to eat/drink a week...I don't remember when was the last time I felt so disappointed like this...  My friends and I were driving to Chicago and decided to stop at Cleveland to have lunch, something easy but nice like pho.  We went there base on yelper s reviews .. 4.5. Stars.. Really excited..  Service was bad,, they forgot our drink .. We had to asked twice to get the drinks we ordered., I got my coke when I almost finished my pho...I still remember the second time I asked about my drink, they said they were doing , I was pissed of asking how hard it was taking a coke from they refrigerator ...    Food was just ok... Not that good ... It's just the place that you stop to fill your hungry stomach .... Nothing more"}
{"text":"Nothing to crazy about here  I tried several times their pho  For me Vietnamese food is pho and spring roll I am ordering those all the time so I dont know about the other foods here  Wish they had bigger bowl I am not talking about portion just bowl size to eat more comfortably   Spring roll was okay nothing wow   After several times trying I ended up with no more going there   Based on many reviews they might have yummy dishes but your davorite is pho and spring roll I wouldnt recommend here"}
{"text":"Vietnamese is a favorite and finding it in Cleveland? This is amazing. I love Pho, their's is one of the best. Find it, Euclid is a pain but this is worth it."}
{"text":"Fantastic pho. The only thing my wife and I didn't enjoy was the bubble tea. Otherwise, another great hidden gem of Cleveland. Thanks guys."}
{"text":"we eat here regularly.  a favorite of locals, students, and professionals working downtown.  this is your go to place for authentic vietnamese cuisine.  Ph dc biêt ($6.95). noodle soup with well done brisket, eye-round steak, flank, beef tripe, and fat brisket.  consistently good.  served perfectly hot with fresh basil and succulent sprouts on the side.  add some sriracha sauce for a hint of spiciness.  love this.  (9/10)   Bún tht nng ch giò ($9.95). grilled marinated pork / fried spring roll / vermicelli   noodles and vegetables.  simply the best.  tried other vermicelli noodles of this kind but nothing compares to this one.  just the right spiciness (for those who aren't a big fan of spicy stuff).  tasty grilled marinated pork.  fresh vegetables.  perfectly complemented with fried crispy spring roll.  (9.5/10)  best vietnamese restaurant in cleveland.  one of the best vietnamese restaurants anywhere."}
{"text":"Best Pho there is! Price good, good size, good amount of meat, best broth around. Nice informal atmosphere. Best Pho anywhere!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place (I love pho) but I have had pho more to my liking elsewhere.  The veggies didn't look all that fresh.  The banh mi wasn't to my liking.  To be fair, I have to admit I am not a huge banh mi fan.  I have only had it about 4 times in my life now, and I've only loved the banh mi at one restaurant in Atlanta, GA (Lee's Bakery - YES, GO THERE FOR PHO AND BANH MI IF YOU'RE EVER THERE) and disliked all the others.  My bf got the Taro Bubble Tea Smoothie, which he liked.  The service was friendly.  They take everything but American Express (the card I was intending to use!).    I guess I just expected more.  I'm sure based on people's palates, they may have differing opinions.  I suppose I just don't have a \"well-developed palate\" as stated below.  The food was okay, but I just didn't think it was what the other reviewers hyped this place up to be (I didn't even know about the world renowned chefs or the man vs. food).  In the end, it came out to $29.20 for iced coffee, taro boba smoothie, large pho combo with banh mi, and another large pho.  I left feeling super full but not really satisfied.  I also wasn't that hungry the rest of the day, so my bf and I ended up skipping food later that night that I had actually been even more excited to try (as it seemed like something that couldn't just be found anywhere locally).  Like I said though, service was friendly and the food was decent.  I guess that's why I'm editing this review to 3 stars.  Honestly, the response made me feel bad for my initial review.  Who am I to say anything at all about food that is hyped up or not?  After all, I'm not a world renowned chef or famous food eater, I'm just a girl.  I'm also all for friendly family-owned businesses, and I'm not trying to knock anyone down by any means, and may have been harsher than I meant to be the first time around."}
{"text":"A contender for the best Pho in Cleveland, really. I usually measure up my Pho experiences to this place.   The Pho is great, savory, clear broth, lots of meat, hot and well priced. Good prices, and even options for your weird friends who only eat vegetables picked under Saturn rising, or something.   As a Clevelander, service is secondary to food quality, so idk about folks complaining about it. As long as the food gets to me hot, I whine little and tip well."}
{"text":"I think I have too high of expectations for pho. This place has so much hype, but I've had better pho in CLE. When your first few pho experiences are outstanding, this just seems mediocre. It's good don't get me wrong, but I don't think it's the best."}
{"text":"I traveled the US and this is the best pho restaurant I've ever ate at. Great service"}
{"text":"My five stars are based purely on the pho.  Of course each person is going to like something a little bit different in their pho, but for me, this is the best.  The atmosphere leaves a little something to be desired.  It is somewhat cold inside in the winter, and because they seem understaffed, there were a lot of dirty dishes sitting around on tables that hadn't been bussed yet.  Also, my server seemed really confused that I didn't want milk in my bubble tea (they must just not make it this way) and then didn't bring it at all.  I had to ask for it again about 10 minutes later.  However, their pho is my ideal.  Broth flavorful but not full of salt like Saigon or cinnamon like Bac.  Plenty of onions to add to the flavor.  Meat very tender and there was a good amount of it.  I will gladly put up with any minor inconveniences to have the best pho."}
{"text":"Superior Pho may appeal to the students and hipsters of the CSU neighborhood, but it didn't appeal to me. My wife and I found it 'nearby' on Yelp after leaving the Cleveland Museum of Art. We're fairly adventurous in the realm of food, and pho is ubiquitous; so we said \"Why not?\" Lemme tell ya 'whynot.' Superior Pho is the single most unsanitary and filthy place I have ever sat down for a meal...from the entryway to the tabletop to the busboy's scummy tub of dishes. If you were to sample the food in isolation from the setting (i.e. delivered), you might give it three stars, but once you have actually experienced the low standards of cleanliness of their 'restaurant,' you'd never eat it again. I know I never will."}
{"text":"LOVE Superior Pho! Great and friendly service... doesn't take long to get your meal. Super affordable. Can't go wrong with this if you want quick and delicious pho!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  The service is on point and warm despite how crazy busy it can get.  I usually only get pho because, come on....it's THE BEST.  I have tried and loved their bahn mi sandwiches, the broken rice and marinated pork and some of the rice bowl combos.  I take all of my friends here and they are always blown away.  Simply the best.  In fact, I plan on stopping there this week after having been there this past weekend.  Just seeing all these photographs of tasty nom noms is bringing a craving on!"}
{"text":"If this is the best pho in Cleveland, I'm sorry.  Had the pho tai (steak only). Portion was ample, as was the steak on the side (I like mine rare).  Sprouts were soggy, lemon on the side can't beat a lime, but most importantly, the broth was just lacking in flavor.  Nothing complex, or robust about it.  Just watery broth. No amount of sriracha, and fixins can overcome that."}
{"text":"I have never had Pho before but had to check it out based on such great reviews.  I have to say, It was pretty damn good!  I did not heed others when they said the portions were large.  Hence, I brought some home.  The broth was really good but I do agree with another reviewer, it was a little heavy on mint (I believe that is what it was) but it didn't bother me.  I would have never found this little hole in the wall without the reviews so thanks for that!  I definitely recommend!!!"}
{"text":"I don't get it. They may be going for authentic and quaint but this place is filthy. I can only imagine what goes on in the kitchen. And after all of the great reviews I was expecting much better food. It's average at best. The only redeeming virtue was the attentive waitstaff.   Hi Chris...To answer your question below, the floors are incredibly dirty. It was disgusting. I wondered if that was why you kept it so dimly lit in there. There are marks all over your walls. Just look at the back one as an example. I feel if you can't keep your dining room clean, how could we ever expect your kitchen to be clean?  I had heard so much good things about your restaurant that I was shocked when I walked in there for the first time.  Best regards,  Mark"}
{"text":"Two of the men who work here are charming. The tamarind soup was good but I wish I would have tried the beef broth instead."}
{"text":"The broth is the true test, and this is some of the nicest broth I've had.  Definitely recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"Pho is a very good way to get introduced to Vietnamese food, and I'm glad Superior Pho could provide that in the simplest and tastiest way possible. Tucked away in a shady neighborhood on the east side makes this place a gem. Even better that it is located inside a really confusing building. From Superior you think you are walking right into Superior Pho, only to be greeted by an obscure cosmetics shop and an open dining room. I'm sure whatever that place was gets so bummed that people aren't looking for them, but somewhere else in the building. Oh well, whatever.   There are a few other restaurants crammed into this building, but Superior Pho is in the back and provides plenty of dining room. Easiest access is to park in the back parking lot and walk in. Can't miss it...well, you can if you don't pay attention.  The menu is simple, just pick out the letter and number and pick small or large if you want Pho. All with different meat variations, but all the same in price. I chose the #3 and added some shrimp. It really doesn't take long at all to make its way out to you. When it does it a huge serving and hot and steamy served with a plate of beansprouts, lime, and other things I don't care for. Hoisin and Sriracha to. Odd spoons and chopsticks make eating pho quite intriguing. I stuck it out, and opted not to get a fork as it takes away from the experience.  Whatever meat was in my number three was tender and thin and oh so good, and the shrimp was a great addition despite the extra $4. Noodles were cooked just right and complimented well the the broth and green onion.  My gal pal got bubble tea with her Pho, and I didn't care for it at all. Not that it didn't taste bad, I just didn't care for the confusing texture of the bubbles. She was also a first time Pho eater and received it well. Fried rice looked awesome, but I despise bean sprouts enough to not bother with any dish that has them mixed in. Maybe I'll try it next time if they can leave them out.  I..we...were super glad this was recommended to us and bothered to make the journey out to the hood. Service could have been more attentive, but definitely the Superior Pho itself made me a fan and will keep me coming back."}
{"text":"2nd time here and pho is very bland. Cannot smell or taste any of the spices (anise, cinnamon etc...) in the pho. Service blows and Not recommended."}
{"text":"Visited pho, extremely disappointed!!! We ordered 2 pho both pho are extremely Gross... The Vegetables was old and shitty!!!! Not worth what u pay for.. Ordered the vegetables pho and end up with just Broth and noodle, asked the server and she said it had bean sprout there forth it's consider vegetables pho, maybe they should go search online and find the definition of vegetables pho... Should have gone to pho & rice in Coventry... They will never have my business EVER Again..."}
{"text":"The ambiance is cool. The servers and the place is nice. Their pho was salty to me. Just keep that in mind when ordering Their bubble tea is just ok. There's better spots where you can purchase bubble tea. It's not a bad spot which is why I gave it 3 stars. But the food is good, just salty."}
{"text":"Best!!! From the broth to the noodles to everything in between... authentic and delicious. Even leaving a review now is making my mouth water and stomach gurgle. The Vietnamese drip coffee is a great pick me up as well as the bubble teas. Yum. Yum. Yum!!!"}
{"text":"I did takeout and ordered vermicelli noodles with marinated pork and fried spring roll.  It was very good and reasonable.  I recommend this place for the food.  To find this place is not easy.  Driving down Superior Avenue, you will not find this place.  I went around the block about 3 times before I just by chance found that the restaurant is towards the back of the building and there is no sign about the restaurant on the front of the building.  There is a big sign on the back of the building with parking."}
{"text":"SO GOOD! Best pho I've had in a long time!  The broth and noodles are good. Plenty of seats.   It's pretty popular so you have to wait for a bit but it's worth it! It's better than the other restaurants in the same building."}
{"text":"Finally made it here after wanting to try it for a long time. We were not disappointed! The pho and banh mi were delicious, and the staff were friendly and made us feel welcome. We had the #1, #3, and #10 pho. The #1 with brisket was exceptional. The chicken cabbage salad appetizer was also fresh, crispy and delicious. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The very finest pho Cleveland has to offer. Charming, no-frills hole in the wall place that is invariably bustling as a result of the high quality of its pho. I've tried a few other places in the area (#1 Pho, etc.) and Superior has the best tasting stock. The #12 (everything) pho had plenty of variety and a good quantity."}
{"text":"Im actually a huge fan of this place! The Vietnamese sandwiches are delicious! The bread they use is always fresh and they pack a spicy kick. When they ask you what number Pho you want I personally would recommend the #2. This place doesn't look like anything special from the outside but once you taste the food you will understand why this place is truly a diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Superior Pho, having stumbled in here for lunch shortly after it opened (before the fancy upgrades: it had garage door walls and fluorescent lighting).  I ate there a couple of times a week for over five years - and was NEVER disappointed.  Wonderful pho with perfect broth, a bahn mi on incredible bread with a hard crusty crunch.    You've got to go in with the right expectations: it is hard to find, tucked in the back of a building off Superior.  it can be noisy, and if it's crowded you might sit with others.  Service can sometimes be spotty.  But it is wonderful cheap eats and seems to be more crowded with Asians and Vietnamese than its fancier (and pricier) pho neighbor   I've taken many people there and referred more. I don't get back often but it has never let me down.    Not too kid friendly unless your kids are adventurous eaters.  No liquor license but you can bring your own."}
{"text":"This place is a hit or miss.  Mostly a hit tho.  Usually get the pork chop rice, or the Pho with everything.  For the Cleveland area, can not complain.  Prices are much higher than other major cities for Pho."}
{"text":"Love this place I always get # 1 Pho with bubble tea . Food and meat portion size is better if you eat there than get take out. Wish there was one closer to me since I live in Mayfield Heights. I have to drive pretty far for my pho fix. Oh and there is a place net to it called # 1 pho or something like that but its not as good as superior pho."}
{"text":"The Pho was great tasting and the small size was more than adequate. I had the beef eye-of round with flank...very tender (#6 combo with cabbage salad, soup additives sprouts, basil, lime and spring roll with suace. I always mix the spr. roll sauce with spicy Thai chili sauce for a perfect taste. The meal left me filling full but not bloated. I topped it off with an Iced coffee w/ evap milk (strong...watch it!)."}
{"text":"This place is as good as it gets for Asian Food in Cleveland.  I'm a regular.  The broth for the Pho is exceptional.  The people who work there bend over backwards to please.  Service is fast and efficient.  If they have it and you like pate try theirs.  Don't be put off by the location, the food and cleanliness inside is great.  I like #10 (Pho Hoa), fried pork Spring rolls and I almost always get a Viet (French) coffee.  Park in the back.  Enter from the back.  Best access is off E 30th straight into Parking lot behind the building.  Hint: ask for Thai basil for your pho."}
{"text":"In regards to Superior Pho, the first thing that comes to mind is Public Enemy's \"Don't Believe the Hype.\" People rave about the food here, but to me nothing I have eaten has ever been exceptional and worthy of the title of Best Pho in town.  Full Disclosure I always get the Tamarind Tofu Pho. My experience with the Pho is a little limited because I do not eat beef, but I have also tried many appetizers, other items with fish and every vegetarian item on the menu. I enjoy the Tamarind Tofu Pho and once you add Sriracha and the sauce and Basil it is pretty flavorful, but needs a little bit of doctoring for my liking. Also very simple things that you would expect at a Pho place seem off. For example, the sprouts are not neatly trimmed and often are beginning to wilt almost every time I come here. The service is usually bad where I might get my water refilled once in an hour and a half visit despite it not being busy.  During my last visit I waited probably close to a half an hour without touching my food, before I walked up to the counter and asked for a to go container. My leftovers would not fit in the small container they gave me and when I asked for a larger one the waitress said I would be charged 50 cents. At any place I have ever eaten in my life I never was charged for an appropriate size box to take food home. The concept of which seems pretty ridiculous to me.   So in conclusion Superior Pho is overrated. I feel like there are comparable Pho places with better service and ambiance that do not charge you for containers to take the food you paid for home."}
{"text":"I have had a strong hankering for pho for over a month now.  Decided to organize a trip up to Cleveland with a couple of friends to fulfill it.   One of my companions had previous pho experience, the other none, but now is hooked.   Our food and service at Superior Pho was well worth the 45 minute drive from Akron."}
{"text":"While most of the people gave this not-so-tiny-but-so-tucked-away restaurant a five stars because of its famous PHO.  I gave this hidden gem restaurant a five stars because of its bun thit nuong.   For me,their bowl of vermicelli noodles with beansprouts,shredded carrots,aromatic basil,fresh cilantro and  spicy sour dressing is become more delightful with their flavourful  grilled pork that make me dancing with the stars. Really!! Never had bad food here. But there is one thing about their bubble tea when last time I came to visit this place.I always ordered green tea BBT and the flavour of it wasn't as stand out as the one I had before that.And it wasn't  sweet enough,kinda bland. Well,it doesn't matter though,because you're still my hidden-not-so-secret-gem."}
{"text":"I've tried pho from several different places around town and when traveling, but Superior Pho is my favorite.  Always delicious.  Always great service.  A bit of strange dingy location, but it somehow adds to the experience.  Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"This is the best pho in Cleveland.  Even the broth alone is stunning.  Once in a while when I feel a cold coming on, I'll roll up here and just get a large container of just the broth (they'll give it to you for only 4 bucks), gulp it down like Rocky Balboa gulps eggs, and it's seriously like the miracle cure.  Everything on the menu is made so well and with so much precision.  Perfect for a date or someone who's new in town.  Makes most other phos in town seem like chicken noodle soup."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I chose this place because of all the yelp reviews. I would never go here. I am vietnamese and I know for a fact it isnt authentic. All the dishes that I tried, I can make it better. For example, summer rolls should have vermicelli noodles, lettuce, beansprouts, cilantro, pork, and shrimp. I understand places make it different but it should be authentic. And the peanut sauce was gross. All you need is a peanut butter, hoisen sauce, and water in a saucepot on low heat. There is nothing here that would make me want to cime back."}
{"text":"The best pho in Cleveland I've had so far! An excellent price for the amount of food you are getting as well. The broth is rich, full, and amazing. The service is brief and you will have to be assertive if you need something extra that they didn't anticipate, but you don't come here for the service. This place really is all about the pho."}
{"text":"The first couple of times I ate here I was actually very pleased. However after having been here dozens of times I can finally write a thorough review.  I typically only order the pho.  The broth and the noodles are always inconsistent. The broth is sometimes good and sometimes really watered down. Sometimes the noodles are good and sometimes served in a clump that is way over cooked.  The bathroom there is absolutely disgusting and maybe the site of a b movie horror flic. It's always been like that btw. If they don't care about their bathroom sanitation then what else might they be 'lax about. Last time we went, we decided it would be our last :(  the bathroom door lock doesn't even work unless you are a lock picking master. When the owner's son saw me struggling he  said just keep trying and laughed at me. I still couldn't get in and then he took the key and he couldn't even get in lol. It's called spend 30 f'n dollars at the hardware store and get a new mechanism!!! Obviously they don't care.  The owner never speaks to us if we are an all man group, but if we're with a female he comes by and greets her in a flirting way. Our one female friend won't go there because the owner won't stop asking her out. Isn't he married?  Last thing, how come almost every time I have been there, the wait staff sprays the cleaning fluid right next to us onto a table and splashes on our table and the smell is awful while you're eating.  Get it together guys!"}
{"text":"went there yesterday for the first time. It was small and in a plaza in the little Asia area. We placed our order and it was there quick the portion of the pho was huge, the bubble tea was amazing. It was a lunch grind, everyone was friendly and the food was amazing! Low priced compared to the pho place down the street and the food was cheaper and well worth it. The T shirts are adorable too!!"}
{"text":"Oh my god, YES.  You know you've got a great place when they care as much for their takeout customers as they do for their dine-in ones. I stopped here on the way home from work last night to get some much-needed Pho for our sickly family. In addition to the #1 (Brisket Pho), I ordered fried spring rolls which were possibly the best spring rolls I've ever tasted, and a Bahn Mi to share.  Maybe it's because my sinuses/passages are completely clogged, but I didn't find the Bahn Mi to be as spicy as last time, and the heat that I did encounter did a good job of allowing me to breathe through my nose again. Nice work!  The pho was great as usual, and I love that they packaged the noodles/meat/onions separately from the broth. They gave you a whole carton of broth and that means that you get about twice as much soup as you would have if they'd have put everything in it to begin with.   Also, a very nice gentlemen offered me a cup of hot (and delicious) tea while I was waiting. What a wonderful touch! And, as if on cue, the second I finished my last sip, the food was there. It was literally no more than 8 minutes that I was waiting for all of it.  LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious.  I come here regularly for a large chicken pho and I always leave satisfied, full, and with a smile on my face.  Off the main road, but is well worth it."}
{"text":"They have the best pho I've ever had in my life (yep, I haven't been to that many Vietnamese places but as an Asian I was hoping my words carry some credibility when it comes to reviewing Asian restaurants). I don't care what they put in their broth but it's so damn good! My personal favorite: # 4, 5, 8, and 11 and the 7c sandwich."}
{"text":"The food was really good. Got brisket, flank, fat pho. It was very flavorful. The  brisket was definitely the tastiest of the meats. I would highly recommend get the brisket pho. And make sure to get the spring roll too!"}
{"text":"If you eat other pho in the area, you'll learn why Superior Pho earns its name.   The broth is fragrant and heavenly, the meat is quality, and the fixings are plentiful. $11.95 for a drink, fresh, crunchy, delicious spring roll with dipping sauce, and generous portion of pho? I don't bother going elsewhere now when I know I have it good here."}
{"text":"Our first day in Cleveland and we wanted to check out the pho situation.  According to Yelp, Superior Pho is the best in Cleveland, so we went.  The short take:  Superior Pho is fine to sate that pho Jones when you find yourself in Cleveland, but if you demand a fine bowl of pho and will not settle for less, this is not your pho shop.  Baseline:  We live in Franklin, TN, 20 minutes from downtown Nashville, where we are spoiled rotten by Vn Pho Deli on Charlotte Pike, where a Vietnamese family and a happy twinkly-eyed lady loves to turn out incredibly delicious pho and egg noodles while her husband and sons keep up with the customers and keep the restaurant cleaned and orderly.  We've also lived in South East Asia for over 10 years and traveled extensively while there, so we know of what we speak when it comes to pho.  We went for dinner and ordered Pho Dac Biet (the works with tripe, tendon, eye of round), Pho Tai (eye of round), Pho Ga (chicken pho), and the house specialties, Bun Bo Hue and Shaking Beef or Bo Luc Lac.  We also ordered green mango salad with beef jerky.  My husband had the Pho Tai. He thought it acceptable, citing the broth as savory and pleasing.  My number one son ordered the Pho Dac Biet--he's an adventurous eater and often orders tripe and tendon.  They both ordered extra meat that came in additional bowls of broth that kept the mean tender, juicy, and hot. If you order extra meat, be sure to make room on your table for extra bowls.  The pho meat is sliced impossibly thin--and is very very tasty.  The tripe had been assiduously cleaned and prepared and was also thinly sliced. No tripe funk detected. I realize for some, that might be part of the charm, but not for me nor my adventurous issue.  The broth was cloudy and a bit salty for my taste and my boyz weren't swooning, which they will do over a deserving bowl of pho.  Pho broth actually shouldn't be salty b/c that's what each diner can do for him/herself is to season the broth and salt it up to one's taste.  The Bun Bo Hue was not what I had expected.  It was bland and the flavors not bright.  The best Bun Bo Hue I've had in the US is still the spectacular one made by the owner himself, Johnny, at Pho Van in Chandler, Arizona, on Dobson Road.  With the first spoonful of broth, I tasted each note separately and then altogether, like a symphony: the shrimp paste, the lemon grass, the garlic, and shallots and a big pork knuckle.  I almost cried.    This was not Johnny's Bun Bo Hue that will forever be the standard by which I will judge this phenomenal Vietnamese soup; I soldiered on, but lost my steam half way through. A good Bun Bo Hue should grab you by the hair, wake you, and shake you.....to your foundations.  Enough on this.  The Bo Luc Lac, Shaking Beef, was also a house specialty, so we had high hopes for it.  Not bad, but the flavors were muddied and not enough aggressive garlic for my taste and too much charring of the beef.  The green mango salad with beef jerky, I must admit, is not something I'd ever had in Vietnam, so I wasn't sure what to make of it.  The mango was very finely shredded, but had not been freshly shredded.  It had been shredded probably at least a day or two before (maybe more) and stored in the fridge -- this is a trick my mom uses so I can tell when green mango has been treated like this.  It dries out a bit and loses its refreshing flavor and the texture stiffens up.  The dressing was a light sweet soy sauce that over powered and drowned the finely shredded papaya and the sweet beef jerky flakes on top didn't add anything to the dish.  Really odd this dish.    The service was swift, silent, and perfunctory--I like that in a Vietnamese noodle shop.  If I don't wave down a server, I don't need them hovering and these folks don't hover, but when I waved, they magically appeared at our table side.  On a second trip for takeout, I tried the chicken salad and banh mi combo. The chicken salad was tasty--the flavoring was right with the salad dressing and the shredded chicken was moist and tender, but the cabbage was shredded so impossibly thinly, that it clumped together like vermicelli noodles -- just a bit off putting, but only a bit.  I supposed if I got used to this texture, it'd be just fine, but I've never had this salad with this cabbage shredded so finely.  The banh mi was a disappointment, barely a teaspoon of pate and the bread was heavy, sub par.  My ruler: the \"sandwich pate\" sold in Vientiane, Laos, by the National theater for $1.50.  Fish saucey pork pate slathered on crackly fresh French bread baked that morning, with a fine dusting of super fine red Mekong dirt puffing up from the street with each passing of a Honda Dream scooter, thin slices of head cheese, pickled carrots and daikon with a squirt of mushroom soy sauce and hot sauce down the middle.  Gawd.  Miss that."}
{"text":"One thing I really like about this place is you get your food quick, piping hot. Place your order and within five minutes you will be one happy camper. I really like the large portions, the super thinly sliced meat and those noodles do it for me. There's something a little too perfumey for me about the broth, maybe Thai basil (which I don't like).   I really enjoy their spring rolls. A nice size in comparison to what I have had elsewhere, well done. I have to have a bahn mi sandwich everytime I come. Normally I hate sweetness in my savory dishes, but this one gets my 'best bahn mi' award. There are so many elements to this sandwhich, between the textures, chewiness of the bread, the crunch and chill from the veggies, this is a great rendition of this Vietnamese staple. For what you pay, I will have to agree, some of the best I have had."}
{"text":"I really enjoy each experience at Superior Pho. The wait time, even when it's busy is usually small, and the servers are models of efficiency. I got into pho a few years ago in Utah and had only tried a few places.  None of them stand up to the quality that is Superior Pho. The broth is so flavorful, and the portion sizes EXTREMELY generous. If you go home hungry, it's your own fault. Towards the end of the meal, I load up the broth with fish sauce and siracha to feel the burn.  Superior Pho works for what it tries to do. Just offer great soup, and none of the unnecessary frills that could drive up prices.  The storefront is a little dingy, and the neighborhood not so nice, but these are minor inconveniences.  Do yourself a favor and get some Superior Pho!"}
{"text":"Not sure how I managed to NOT review this place yet!  Have been here a handful of times and each visit has been rock solid.  Standard meal is a summer roll and a small bowl of pho with a mix of various beef cuts.  Their broth is hearty and delicious as the meats begin to cook right in the bowl.  Add in the fresh veggies plated on the side and things start to really get going.  Finally, add a few dabs of sriracha and you are totally in business!  Just get those napkins ready for a few forehead sweats....love it!  Small joint, attentive service and Vietnamese dining perfection.  What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"The best pho in Cleveland! I don't usually order pho but I will at Superior Pho. Their pork chop dishes are delicious and the bahn mi is great enough to eat everyday. It's very busy and fast paced, but service is not compromised. Absolutely love this place!"}
{"text":"We checked out this place because it had really good reviews on yelp and yelp usually never fails. Unfortunately, this was not the case for our visit to Superior Pho. We were seated by a less than friendly waitress at a table that was still dirty from the previous diners. When we went to order, I asked the waitress what kind of drinks are included in the meal deals. She told me soda, iced tea, and iced coffee. I order the iced coffee only to find an extra 4 dollars tagged onto the final bill. My 12 dollar \"deal\" turned into a ridiculous 16 dollars for bland, tasteless food.   Hope other yelpers will have a better experience than we did. :("}
{"text":"Over the last few years I have been here 25-30 times and I have truly come to appreciate their quality. I love the papaya salad. I think their marinated pork over broken noodles is the best in the area. The pho is very good. It I prefer the broth at Minh Anh.   Try the shrimp bahn mi. It is not on the menu but it is delicious."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and this place has the best Pho I have ever had hands down...it isn't even close.  My friends rave about Saigon and I have been there too...this place is waaaay better.  Saigon has the atmosphere but Superior has the better food.  Like I said the place isn't much to look at but don't let that fool you.  I do not give out many 5 star reviews...people seem to throw those around...this place is the real deal."}
{"text":"I'm not lying.  This was some great pho, but that's just the half of it. Their Goi Tom or Shrimp cabbage salad rocked my world!  I'll wax elegant on the salad first: clean, fresh, crisp. The thinly sliced shrimp were numerous and the cabbages' fine shred, combined with shaved carrots, sweet onion, and diced peanuts made this a meal I'd go back for daily! They served it with a small bowl of fish sauce, but you don't need it, cause the light flavorful dressing marrys all the ingredients perfectly!  The house special beef pho was also noteworthy. The tendon was clean, soft, and yummy. The thinly sliced rare beef was amazing, then the broth brought it all home.  Portions you ask? Huge! Any questions?"}
{"text":"I am new to Vietnamese food. I liked my rice with marinated pork, and my companions liked their pho and bahn mi. Restaurant was clean, but the building it was in and the restrooms down the hall were not. We had a new waitress whose inexperience, mixed with our inexperience, made for a hard time ordering. Overall, my experience was average, but would give it another try because the food was the strongest part of the experience and the rest could have just been a bad day."}
{"text":"I have to start this review out saying that I have never eaten anything here except the Pho (and the spring rolls as appetizers, I suppose), and I never plan to. Why change something that is perfect?!  Superior Pho brings to mind a college hangout restaurant, but is frequented by pretty much every sort of person you would expect. And very simply, that is because you get the best Pho in Cleveland (possibly in Ohio - I certainly haven't had better, here or back in Boston) at ridiculously good prices!  Expect to be set back $7 - $8 for a humongous bowl of Pho (read: noodle soup) with your choice of delectable meat/tofu in it. Quick courteous service, delicious food (did I mention that already.... hmmmm.....) and cheap prices will have me going back regularly as long as I live in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Don't do it! Extremely harsh, not polite,Mean older male taking the orders at the front counter-could be the owner. Started off w the wrong order,Bland food, watery dipping sauce, who knows whats in the spring rolls."}
{"text":"Loved it here. Great lunch experience minus the crowd and being a little difficult to pay the check afterwards. Pricing is very reasonable and portions are ridiculous. Combo 10 and spring rolls! Yum."}
{"text":"Solid Pho is just that, no matter what city you happen to be in. If you're like me and need a Pho fix once a week, Superior Pho will not let you down.  I was scared at first when I saw that the staff was super friendly as that usually indicates a problem at a Pho house but have no fear, the food here is great."}
{"text":"Superior Pho's just ah'ight. Ambiance matters to me. Superior Pho might get another star if I didn't know there were other Pho joints nearby that appeared cleaner, cuter, and didn't need me to walk through a strange rape hallway to get to them. It isn't that the restaurant looks dirty. It just doesn't sparkle or have any discernible decorations. That, combined with the dank hallway you take to find the dining room, doesn't leave me with any lasting impression. The food was tasty, but not better than other Pho I've had in Cleveland. I think the prices were the same as #1 Pho down the street. My gut says people prefer Superior Pho because they feel like they are unearthing a well hidden treasure. I really didn't notice the food being better at all."}
{"text":"Superior Pho has the best chicken pho. Take-out takes 5 to 15 minutes, and soup has so much flavor and gives the customer room to customize by providing containers of sauces. It is so fresh that I could eat this soup once a week. A large take out pho gives me soup for three days.  Highly recommend the tofu spring rolls. You can taste how fresh they are, and tofu is very soft and spongy, making it less intimidating for people who are eh about tofu. Youre missing out if you haven't been here."}
{"text":"Fresh, quality ingredients, fast service, fair prices and the best bread.   The pho is tasty. But I'm annoyed by spending time eating the huge bowl. You need patience.   It's great stuff, but the Banh mi sandwich is just as good. With French bread that's soft on the inside with a perfectly crisp crusty bite on the outside.   Summer rolls. Yes. And their fried cousins. Also, yes. The rice dishes are fantastic. Very garlicky. Easy to eat. Quality."}
{"text":"Now this is a tried and true Cleveland staple! I've been frequenting this place for years and after a way too long hiatus I revisited this place just in the nick of time (before it's early 8pm weekday close). I got my usual #10 combo - large pho, bahn mi and a soda. I'll be honest, a lot of the meat options are only mildly distinguishable, it all end up tasting like thin fully cooked meat, but that's fine. The simple broth and fresh veggies are the real winners. The large pho fills you up and but the subtle flavors make you go for more. The banh mi is a healthy serving of meat and pickled veggies, cilantro and sliced jalapenos. Bite into that thing and your welcomed with the contrasting crunching from the fresh cucumber and carrots and the lightly toasted bread. Again, simple but utterly delicious!!"}
{"text":"One of my regular lunch spots. Generally very quick & service is par. Love the Pho & the fried spring roll. Prices are a little bit higher then the other local pho. See you soon..."}
{"text":"This was my 1st visit here and if I wouldn't have ran into another couple looking for the same place I wouldn't have found it. Come to find out there's a parking lot and entrance around the back of the building, not on Superior. Since the was our first visit we also didn't know they close early and we made it with 10 minutes to spare but that didn't affect our food. Our food came out very quickly.  I've never had pho before so I can't compare it to other dishes but I can say it was VERY good and I have no complaints. I also haven't tried bubble tea before so I've got no comparison but this was creamier than expected, almost smoothie like.   We will be returning when we have more time to enjoy our food."}
{"text":"You have to try the bubble tea! The pho was nice and hot on a wintry afternoon. The service was fast the environment nice. The spring rolls were amazing. The only thing I would change is a bit of a leaner cut of meat and smaller pieces. I have to cut my soup with a knife."}
{"text":"Impossible to find. Worth the search. Some of the best pho I've had and I'm a phonatic. The bubble tea is also excellent. I got the chicken pho. Husband got something with lots of unusual beef parts. Both were delicious."}
{"text":"Superior Pho is not only named for its location in Cleveland. It's aptly named for it's superior food and drink.   I've only been here twice, but I can already tell you it is one of my new found favorites in Cleveland.   I've only had one kind of meal from here so far, and that's their brisket and flank steak pho. It is so delicious. I couldn't help myself and I got the large both times. The bowls are filled with a beautifully fragrant broth with meat, veggies, and noodles. I'm excited to expand my horizons because one of the servers brought something that wasn't pho out to another customer, and it smelled amazing. I can't wait to go back for something else.   I really enjoy their bubble tea as well. The mango bubble tea is my favorite. I will say that the black tapioca pearls are an acquired taste, but I find them tasty and enjoyable.   You will not regret giving Superior Pho a shot. It's super tasty and affordable."}
{"text":"The broth is amazing.  I usually get #9, and then add all of the garnishes plus a swirl of plum sauce and sriracha.  Soooo good! Service is fast, parking is easy, and the pho is the real deal.  I used to live in Houston where there is a huge Vietnamese population and was happy to find a place to satisfy my cravings here.    I've also tried the bahn mi, papaya salad, and summer rolls. All are ok. Bahn mi to be honest is pretty mediocre compared to what I've had in Houston-more expensive and less delicious. If you want Bahn Mi, go to On the Rise. Their french roll is legit, and the sandwich innards are not all traditional but it is closer to the real deal in terms of amount and quality of meat and veggies.  The summer rolls are good, not special.  I honestly can't remember what the papaya salad tasted like... just get the pho!"}
{"text":"I first went here on Wednesday with my friend who is from Cambodia. I instantly fell in love with the food and the atmosphere! I got the #12 and a strawberry bubble tea and everything was absolutely delicious! I loved it so much that I had to go back again on Friday with my boyfriend! I think Pho might be my new favorite food!"}
{"text":"My husband brought home dinner a few nights ago. We ordered pho. Much like most food in Cleveland though, it was really lacking in flavor.  The broth was so bland. It tasted a bit like watered-down canned beef broth.   I'm from Los Angeles, so I'm accustomed to a wide array very strong flavors and spicy foods. I realize that there probably isn't a whole lot of Vietnamese culture in Cleveland, as well as a market for strong flavor, but I was really expecting much more. The banh mi sandwich was pretty tasty, but it ended there. I was really disappointed, partially because I really miss my Vietnamese spots back home.  I will give them another shot soon and see if they can make the broth any stronger for me."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that if you don't know about, you would never get the chance to experience it.  I went with my huge photo class and everything was served in efficient time and hot! I ordered the classic chicken pho and it was so satisfying, and it was just a \"small\"! They have little herbs and greenery to add on a side dish that gives the yummy broth everything it needs in flavor. Good price too, definitely recommended."}
{"text":"This is the best Pho in Cleveland! Good authentic stuff, but also a decent offering for Americanized pallettes. :)   Don't forget to get yourself some bubble tea!   The service is a little hit or miss when it's busy, but they're quick to respond to requests and the food makes it worth it."}
{"text":"Pho as good as pho gets, but not much ambiance."}
{"text":"Adequate to satisfy my pho cravings every now and then. Is slightly above average for Cleveland, but below average compared to the pho shops in San Diego or San Jose. My main issue is too much MSG -- it's easy to detect and can feel it afterwards. I usually get pho for breakfast for a hangover, but it doesn't work for that reason. If you've had korean-style pho in LA or NY, it has a comparable level of MSG.   Bahn mi is okay but the bread is not great, which is 75% of what I look for in a good bahn mi. Spring rolls are serviceable.  There are other options for pho in Cleveland without MSG, but not all are that great. I used to go to the viet restaurant next door before it closed down though mostly for the non-pho dishes."}
{"text":"There are too many good dishes here to mention all of them, but my favorite is the shrimp and rice dish.  One of the things that stood out to me was the young lady that serves as greeter/hostess/waitress has such a welcoming smile, she's really great at what she does."}
{"text":"OK. So I'm sorry, but this place shouldn't be called \"Superior\" (even though it's on a street called Superior) because it needs to live up to the name, don't you think? If you're really superior than other pho joints, you better have the best freaking pho in town! I think I've had better pho, to be completely honest...but it could also be that I prefer a different type of broth (the broth will be different depending on the region of Vietnam). I mean, don't get me wrong...I enjoyed my bowl of pho quite thoroughly...but maybe I was expecting it to be phenomenal after making the mistake of accidentally going to #1 Pho next door and hearing about how awesome this place is.  So you really need to know where this entrance is located: the building itself does face the street, but you have to go around to the back of the building in order to enter through the \"front door\" of the restaurant. It shares the same building of the Korean restaurant, so don't be confused!  We ordered one of the combos that had the pho + the bahn mi sandwich. The bahn mi sandwich was pretty good, I wish they used the pate that most other places are supposed to use in the bahn mi sandwiches. But I really liked the type of meat that they used, it reminded me of Italian cured meats that you get on a meat board. And, like I mentioned before, the pho was decent. Maybe the broth wasn't at its best that day."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pho place in Cleveland. The service is fast and people are great here. I always order takeout from here and can pick it up within 20 minutes with no problem. The meat in the Pho and the rest of the ingredients are fresh. The Banh Mi is spicy, savory, and the meat is cooked perfectly. The baguette on the sandwich is crunchy and never stale. They put the right amount of sauce and it delicious. The peanut sauce for the shrimp summer rolls is great although the rolls itself can be a little bland."}
{"text":"Superior Pho in one word is \"underwhelming\".  I'm surprised this place has so many great reviews.  Maybe it's because I'm from a traditional background and i was expecting traditional pho but I was disappointed in their food and service.  The place is small, although they did expand.  It's crowded, cleanliness is questionable and they seem quite hectic and disorganized during busy times.  The broth soup for their pho is bland, and seems like it's a bit watered down.  They skimp on giving you the portions of meat with the pho.  Their \"meatballs\" were cut into 4ths to be served...seriously?  Seems like their food has been \"americanized\" which I guess is fine, but doesn't sit well with me since I'm expecting authentic ethnic food no matter the culture.  There numerous better alternatives to Superior Pho with superior food (no pun intended), ambiance and service."}
{"text":"My first time at Superior Pho, I thought the food was okay, but it grows on you. I come here about once a week now for pho or a combination meal. It definitely hits the spot after a long night of drinking or cold Cleveland weather.  For the pho, I usually go with the #2 (w/ eye-round steak) or #13 (w/ the chicken).  It's a value to order a combination meal which includes with the pho, either a summer roll or a banh mi (vietnamese sandwich), and a soda.  Something to remember when ordering a roll, the spring roll = egg roll and the summer roll = spring roll. It's a confusing, but the summer roll is pretty good. Unless, you like the fried egg roll, which they call the spring roll...  As for the banh mi, it's aight... I actually recommend it with grilled marinated pork. I think it tastes a lot better than the usual homemade pate and roasted pork.  Easy recommendation if you are craving pho"}
{"text":"First time here!!!  I am NOT impressed with Superior Pho.  the restaurant is dirty & dirty floor and noticed bugs around. Please wipe the mess on the floor.   I shouldn't expect 5*s pho restaurants  in Cleveland, OH!!"}
{"text":"Best pho I have ever had.  This is a Cleveland must for those visiting our city and want to experience great food not found other places.   Must have the beef and add in your own spices.  Getting there from the parking lot in the back of a strip of stores adds to the mystique."}
{"text":"Pho here is excellent!  Very flavorful and hearty. They are very generous in their portions.  The location is somewhat out of the way.  While the address is on Superior, you actually have to enter from the rear.  This is not to be confused with its neighbor #1 Pho which is also on 30th and Superior.  While #1 Pho is very good and has the better location and atmosphere, Superior Pho is hands down the \"superior\" winner when it comes to the food.    Mmmm, comfort food!"}
{"text":"I have just moved to Cleveland 3 weeks ago and have had a craving for Pho, so had to try Superior Pho since it had so many reviews.  Well first I actually passed by this place 3x, I could not find it.  So finally I looked up the pictures on my phone, it is not on Superior side of the street, the restaurant is behind this building... don't get it confused with Pho #1, the corner of Pho #1 is where you actually turn to, and then there's a parking lot, and in that parking lot there is a small sign for Superior Pho.  If I didn't turn into that parking lot, I probably would have gone to Pho #1.  Anyway, I went at peak lunch time traffic, at 11:45AM, luckily I didn't have to wait, Good Service and very fast, which I liked.    I ordered the Pho Dac Biet #12, with everything on it, but I should have ordered one with less meat, there was sooo much meat in it, I mean I think most people like that, but I had ordered a small bowl and could not finish it, actually I had a ton of meat left over.  Anyway portion size was good for a small bowl of Pho.  I thought the broth was very clean and fresh, my veggies could have been fresher.  Meat in the pho was also good, not a weird taste like some places.  I will definitely be back, I was happy with my bowl of Pho.  Service was excellent, 3 different employees had ask me how my pho was, and I think that's really good for an asian restaurant.  Asian restaurants are never known for their service.  Overall Service 5 star Pho 3.5-4 Star (My mom use to own a pho restrauarant so I am a harsh critic when it comes with Pho)"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and eat here! This is the absolute best pho I have had yet. I love pho! I try it everywhere I go and Superior Pho is hands down the best. They make thier broth from scratch unlike other places that use a mix. The owner is super friendly and even went so far as to add an item to three menu that I asked for several times (pho bo kho or beef and carrot stew). They have it add a special a couple times a week. Try it you won't regret it."}
{"text":"This is Definitely some of the most delicious Pho I have ever had. I ordered a large bowl, #7. My husband got the #8. The broth was very flavorful and the ingredients super fresh. I can see why other Yelpers call Superior Pho the best Pho in Cleveland. For an appetizer, we ordered the grilled marinated pork spring rolls and these were awesome!! All of the food came to our table incredibly fast. We ordered bubble tea to go. I had the green tea and my husband had the passion fruit. It was frozen, and I had never tried frozen bubble tea, but it was very enjoyable. I would definitely go back to Superior Pho for my next Pho craving."}
{"text":"Been a loyal customer for years. You would be safe trying every single dish on the menu.  Absolutely amazing food and prices!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend!!! Great place. As authentic as it gets. Not a bowl of MSG...nicely balanced. Friendly wait staff...nice environment, plenty of parking. Will def be making the hour hike back every weekend!!!"}
{"text":"This place had a bunch of good reviews, so I wanted to try it out. It is nestled in a little Asian center that has a few other food vendors. The restaurant itself is very cozy and pretty spacious with its two rooms. Staff were also pretty friendly.  As for the food, I was not very pleased. I had the goi cuon (summer roll) and the bun bo hue.. Both were sub-par. The summer roll looked like it was quickly thrown together and tasted just ok. The bun no hue was not very flavorful and it did not taste like traditional bun bo hue at all... It was very garlic-strong. Probably my worst experience of having bun no hue in a restaurant. I tried my boyfriend's pho and banh mi.. The banh mi was probably the best tasting out of everything (great bread!) and the pho was just ok, a bit bland.   However this place seems to be popular with locals and families of non-Vietnamese decent. I will reiterate that the food wasn't terrible but it was just not authentic tasting (coming from a Vietnamese person). I personally was not pleased."}
{"text":"Oh, how I love Superior Pho. Oh, how I crave it each week. The beef pho is great, and the marinated pork vermicelli bowl is so tasty. The summer rolls are nice and fat, and the iced coconut drink with grass jelly and lychee is just wonderful. Superior Pho takes its last orders at approximately 7:59 p.m., so do not arrive after 8:00 p.m. (or 7:00 p.m. on a Sunday; closed all day on Monday), or you will be turned away on an empty stomach. Great food, fast service, no-frills decor -- my kind of place."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a busy Saturday and was seated promptly. The service was quick, almost too quick. Felt somewhat rushed, but I know they want to turnover tables asap, so not a problem. Food was good. Wife had a beef Pho and I had the banh mi and a Summer roll. The bread for the sandwich was great, which was nice because they skimped on the meat a bit. A good place, but the parking is a nightmare."}
{"text":"Best pho in Cleveland! Seriously. Other attributes: fast service, chill vibe, friendly staff"}
{"text":"Very tasty pho with clear, beefy broth as it should be.  If you prefer heavily spiced, thick and salty broth, then this may not be the pho place for you.  The staff were friendly, and I really enjoyed my dinner.  The ice tea was delicious - perhaps restaurant brewed and didn't taste sugary or artificial. The beef, basil and bean sprouts may not be the highest quality, but the price is pretty decent for the meal."}
{"text":"the food is OK, but the pho seemed heavy on msg. the service is poor after taking the order, and most staff are Westerners who cannot speak the names of Vietnamese dishes. it is also pricey for what you get imho."}
{"text":"I did not like this place overall. I liked the noodles, but the meat was way too hard, they need to cook the meat a little bit softer. But not bad place, I really liked the boba tea at this place, it was really good and sweet."}
{"text":"The food here was great, the rest...eh.  I am not a huge soup for dinner person, but the brisket (#1) pho was perfect.  Very much a meal.  Liked the sauce options as well.  Not realizing the size I ordered the combo with the sandwich, ( combo #10 I think).  Lovely crusty baguette with delicious fresh French inspired herbs.  A little heavy on the mint for my preference, but overall tasty.    The down side was the atmosphere. From the outside I was apprehensive, though the place was packed.  Inside wasn't much different.  The tablescape reminded me of a take out resuaraunt where they really don't want you to stay.  I went with hubby, the kids, and another family.  They couldn't fit us at 1 table so we separated.  Not a huge deal but FYI if you have a large group (there were 10 of us.)  I was slightly frustrated that our meal came out before we got any drinks.  If I wanted the food that fast, it would have been amazing.  I think if we would have timed them from the time our order was taken to receipt of food.... 90 seconds?  Really not sure how they did that!!  My preference is to relax at dinner though, so beyond the sheer amazement of the speed, I was not impressed.  We did have to ask for our drinks several times but beyond that the service was ok.    Overall, an excellent place for takeout would be my recommendation."}
{"text":"If you are wondering what Pho is think a broth-y soup with an assortment of vegetables and noodles, with meat and other items that can be added. This was the first place I tried Pho and I have been hooked ever since. Come hungry and even then you will be taking enough home for lunch the next day.  Also try the spring rolls. They have mint in them and are fantastic. I usually get about 4 just for myself."}
{"text":"Finding this place is like unlocking a secret level on Super Mario.  First off, there's no sign out front.  Second off, just down the block is a restaurant with a big sign saying \"#1 PHO\" and I suspect a lot of people go, \"Oh, there's the Pho place!\"   But #1 Pho is not, in fact, the #1 Pho.  And if you walk past the bakery in front, and go past the other restaurant, down a hallway that looks for all the world like it leads to the bathrooms at the back, you will find....  ...wait for it...  THE BEST PHO IN CLEVELAND.    My friend Ian brought me here, and I had the Vietnamese sandwich, some iced coffee, and some pork Pho.    The sandwich was a thing of cheap beauty; there was nothing elaborate about it, but the bread was fresh with a thick, chewy crust like the best French bread, and it was crunchy with tiny slivers of vegetables, dotted with little ragged hunks of some savory sliced meat.  To this day I have no idea what was inside it, but it made my mouth extremely happy.    The Pho noodles were... Well, most broth-based dishes are watery and disappointing, like chicken stock gone wrong.  This broth was muscular and manly, shouldering its way to the front of your palate and going, \"I AM FLAVOR, HEAR ME ROAR!\"  The noodles had soaked up the broth, rich and pungent in a good way, and the little crispy bits of veggies made it all slurpworthy.    The only slight ding is the iced coffee, which was a tad bitter for my tastes... But on the other hand, you get to make it yourself with condensed milk in a French press-style gadget that makes you feel oddly triumphant when you finally assemble your drink of choice.  Overall, I'd be going here weekly if it wasn't on the other side of town.  Also, not a great place to dine out, because it looks like ass.  But on the other hand, you feel the thrill of discovery, because damn, it looks like a hole in the wall and OMG THE PHO.    Pho-tastic, baby."}
{"text":"This is my ultimate FAVORITE pho in all of cleveland. They also have, in my opinion, the best egg rolls in cleveland. So get the combo pho (small bowl) plus spring roll and a drink. Oh and get mango bubble tea!!"}
{"text":"I love Pho and this is by far the best Pho I have ever had.  The broken rice is delicious too!!  I've gotten Superior Pho every single for the past 3 or 4 years- I just seem to have forgotten to post a review.  It tastes even better than my Vietnamese friend's mom's pho.    The pho broth is perfectly seasoned and I usually get the traditional (beef fliet and meatball) pho or the seafood pho.  When you add the basil, lime, and the siracha/hoisin sauce to it- It's BEYOND PHENOMENAL.  Places like #1 Pho tend to make their broth a little sweet ( which I don't like and most traditional phos are not sweet in the slightest bit), but their pho is just right and more savory than anything else.    The Broken Rice is the best- it's my usual dish.  I love the pieces of marinated pork chop topped with the fried garlic on top.  The pickles and carrots are not to miss with the mix of hot chilis and siracha sauce.  I usually skip on the transparent spicy sweet sauce because it's not needed.  It's absolutely delicious the way it is.  They give a large portion with plenty of rice to go with it!  It's cheap and afforable as a college student.  I don't feel bad getting it every week kind of cheap.  If you haven't gone you have to try it you wont be disappointed! :)"}
{"text":"The waitress was extremely rude. The way she treated us make me feel uncomfortable. This restaurant does not have a service at all. We ordered the beef noodle soup and shrimp cabbage salad, the food is average."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch while I was taking a weekend class, and was worried that there would be a lack of vegetarian options. While there weren't many, there were still more than what I was expecting. I had dau hu cuon (tofu summer rolls) and bun dau hu (vermicelli noodles with tofu). Both were delicious, even though it wasn't the \"pho\" experience. The noodles were a huge portion, and I had more than enough for lunch the next day. Everyone at the table seemed to enjoy their meal as well.  Service was a bit lacking, but that's probably because it was during the lunch rush. It did take about 20 minutes to get our bill though."}
{"text":"I've seen this written up on \"best of Cleveland\" lists many times, so we went one weeknight in Jan to grab some pho before a show at Playhouse. The dining room was basic, we ordered a pho with steak and one of the noodle salads (can't remember the actual name)  The pho broth was amazing, loved the depth of flavor and I see how it's so highly touted. The noodle salad was also flavorful. I tried a bubble tea as well, it's a frozen blended variety instead of shaken milk tea but I liked their taro flavor. An order of spring rolls, pho, noodle salad, bubble tea was $29 so it's definitely an affordable destination. We will be back."}
{"text":"Man how do I even begin to describe Superior Pho?  I lived in Cleveland for 4.5 years and to say the least, it was rough.  But having this place is one of the things that made me stick around for that long.  Their Pho is some of the best I've had.  The noodles, broth, meat, veggies are all so perfect.  Their summer rolls and vermicelli is also some of the best you can find.  Their rice dishes are great.  Service is very quick and staff is friendly.  Perfect for a quick, tasty, and cheap meal.  Trust me, it doesn't get better than this.  I've had top rated vietnamese food in New York, Washington D.C., Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and Boston, and this is the best!  I live in Philadelphia now and the Pho here just doesn't cut it.  But every so often I find myself dreaming about this place =)."}
{"text":"So, after a taste of this place, my wife and I wanted to try more; we were not disappointed.   I had tried pho previously, but we'd always heard about this wonderful, mysterious place and upon our finding it (it's a little deceptive as the main entrance is on the BACK of the building at the appointed address,which is where parking is as well.)   I got to try their standard pho, as well as some wonderful braised pork, and my wife and I got to try their summer rolls (the non-fried version of the popular spring roll,) as well some amazing coffee, made with sweetened condensed milk and a coffee so rich, it'll make your eyes roll right out of your head:)   I give this place high praise, the people running it are nice folks and the food is made with great care; I give this place a pho-nomical rating for pho-nominal food:)"}
{"text":"Having been to Lac Viet Market here in Columbus, I knew that pho was quite good. But friends from Cleveland had told me that Superior could simply not be beat. Needing to check it out, I stopped there on the way to see the Browns shellack the Patriots while back home in Cleveland.  One word can describe Superior: phenomenal. I got the meal #1, which gave you any pho you want (small), a spring/summer roll, and a can of pop for a hair under $10. The first thing I got was my Spring Roll. Filled with rice, fresh shrimp, and some tasty peanut sauce, it hit the spot while I waited for my pho.  The \"small\" pho was enough to feed two people. What made it so special was the broth. At other pho places I've been to, I've needed to put copious amounts of sriracha or plum sauce in before I could enjoy it. Not so at Superior. The broth was flavorful and hearty. Both the noodles and the chicken in the pho were quite good as well.  Overall, Superior might have become my new favorite restaurant in Cleveland. It's cheap, tasty, and hearty, meeting all of my major food requirements. So if you're in Cleveland, take a journey over to Superior and enjoy some Superior Pho."}
{"text":"Best pho in Cleveland hands down. This is not the best pho you will ever have if you have had authentic pho around the world. But this place has a light broth that satisfies your pho cravings! The service is super fast in a tiny restaurant in Cleveland's Asia town.  I have gone here many times and have never needed to wait long for a table. 10/10 my go to place for pho in Cleveland."}
{"text":"There are several good places to get pho in Cleveland - this is the best.   It all starts with the broth here (as it should). Clear, hearty and flavorful, but what stands out with Superior Pho is the balance. No metallic fish sauce flavors here, just an incredibly nuanced, well-seasoned bowl of broth. Best in town, and in my humble opinion, slightly better than the competition next door.   For me, that's worth 4 out of 5 stars. If you're not like me, meaning epic pho broth doesn't keep you up at night, you'll be pleased to know that Superior Pho has other delicious menu items, like their chicken cabbage salad (again, big, bright, balanced flavors) and spring/summer rolls. I have not had their bahn mi yet, but that's just a matter of time.   The startlingly fast service (like, not-enough-time-to-eat-your-appetizer fast), clean decor (which is a problem elsewhere), and great prices aren't to be ignored, either. As good as it gets, for sure."}
{"text":"I'm from NYC and I had some really good pho. During a road trip we passed by this place and decided to give it try with its good ratings on Yelp. There's parking, which is a plus. I had the classic pho and it was really good. The broth was tasty and not oily at all."}
{"text":"Great vietnamese, don't bother going next door to number 1 pho.  Most authentic in the area."}
{"text":"this is one of the most superb servings of food in northeast ohio. simply stated brilliant servings and the broth is something like otherworldly. holy moly and don't forget the kind service that will bring me back again for more of the famous pho"}
{"text":"Pho is one of my favorite meals. I love a hearty soup in any weather. I brought my kids who also wanted to give it a try. They are very adventurous and my son loves the Siracha. He and I both got Pho gao (chicken pho). I had the combo with a summer roll which was yummy. He had a large bowl which he devoured. My daughter had a bowl, but ate some of my soup as well. I have heard lots of rave reviews and would certainly go back. I am more partial to Saigon, though, from the taste of the broth to the ambiance of the restaurant."}
{"text":"First time visit with this place and was very pleased.  I got pho tái, my girlfriend got the banh mi sandwich, and we split an order of bì cuon (summer rolls).    I was worried about the bì cuon because it only came with 2, but they're pretty large so it was definitely worth the price at $4.  The dipping sauce that they come with is pretty good, but i have no idea what it is.  Girlfriend gave the sandwich 4/5.  I took a bite and was not wowed, but it was fine.    I ordered the pho tái (#2) because it appeared to be pretty basic and I wanted to try something safe for my first time.  The broth was very flavorful, and the noodles were cooked to just the right consistency for me.  The beef was not overcooked and fit in with the dish well.  I guess I was expecting the beef to have more flavor on its own, but I'm not sure if that's a feature or a bug.  Service was speedy, prices were reasonable.  Definitely worth a repeat!"}
{"text":"The best Pho ever! Nice place to eat, Staff are great...fast service you don't need to wait for so long to be serve..."}
{"text":"How can you not love this place? The pho is so cheap! It is so good! If you get one of their meal combos (I usually get a large Pho #12 which has all of the meats except meatballs and a bahn mi sandwich), you will definitely have food left over.   The defining quality of pho - the only thing I think you should look for - is the quality of the broth. This broth is to die for. There is just so much flavor to it. But if you love sirracha like me, a couple tablespoons doesn't hurt the flavor at all. It is just perfect!   The service is extremely fast. A bunch of friends and I went to Pho in between dance practice and our show at the nearby Masonic auditorium. They seated all 16 of us and had us full and out of the door within 40 minutes. I don't know where else you can get such fast service.   Although there are 3 pho places around (Saigon Grille, #1 pho and superior pho), I would definitely come here if you can. It's cheaper than the other places, has better quality and better service."}
{"text":"This is probably the best pho you'll find out here in cleveland. Doesn't compare to other pho places I've been to in LA or SF, but it'll hit the spot.  I had the #2 pho and a marinated pork spring roll. The pho satisfied the craving I had and had a nice broth. I finished the entire bowl, including the soup. The spring roll wasn't bad. It was fresh and the mint was a nice touch as well.   Service wasn't too notable. Our food came out fast enough. And when you pay by credit card, they only give you tip options of 15%, 20%, or 25%, which my friend found annoying. As far as we could see, there was no option to type in your own tip amount.  The restaurant was a little hard to find, even though we put it into google maps. There are other nearby pho places that you might get confused with. We only found the entrance through the back and could not see one on the front as we were driving. I guess you just have to drive around and park in the back, and then you'll see the sign and entrance from there."}
{"text":"Came here today with my family. We're from columbus and the quality of the food here is below par from what we're used to. How this place gets a 4 star average is beyond me. The pho is very bland. Hoisin sauce and sriracha could not save the broth. the bun bo hue is super garlicky. Bun bo hue should not be garlicky at all. The summer rolls came out warm. Another family that ate next to us shared the same opinions. The Vietnamese sandwiches were ok. I only had two leafs of cilantro on it though. They didn't skimp on the carrots and daikon. Overall, was not impressed. Hopefully the other viet restaurants don't disappoint in this area"}
{"text":"Discovered this place thanks to Yelp! lol. I absolutely loved it.  Excellent vietnamese restaurant.  The service was great as well. They are one of the few restaurants open on a Sunday in downtown Cleveland."}
{"text":"Pretty solid!  I happened to have the spring rolls, winter rolls and pork on broken rice... as well as a Vietnamese Iced Coffee.  All of which were solid.  Price point was quite reasonable, and wait staff reasonably prompt and attentive.    It is, however, located as if intentionally hidden from prying eyes.  Can't figure out exactly the though process involved in arranging this building, but it's shared with a Shiseido (fake?) boutique, a barbeque joint and a Korean restaurant... there may be more, but one can never tell...  But, holes-in-the-wall are supposed to be fun finds that require finding.  They don't market themselves with millions of dollars, and that nets the consumer savings.  Word-of-mouth yumminess.  It's well worth parking in somewhat less savory environments to eat here.  Definitely will be back.  After I try the pho, I might be raising the score!"}
{"text":"Awesome pho, great summer rolls, bubble tea on point. What a hidden gem. Not only delicious food but fast and friendly service. Must go."}
{"text":"I had another wonderful meal last night at Superior Pho!   The combination meal #10 (banh mi and a large order of pho) was so satisfyingly amazing.   I didn't realize how LARGE their large pho was! There's no way I could finish it in one sitting. Especially since I had the best banh mi sandwich in CLE served along with it!   I'm so happy that CLE has this good of a pho restaurant to call it's own.   Superior Pho is one of the few places that I don't mind driving across town to enjoy!"}
{"text":"Why have I never reviewed Superior Pho?? I'm incredulous. I love Superior Pho!!  The pho is great, as I'm sure the other reviewers have noted. (Broth=MM with very generous portions & it's $6.95 for a small.) I regularly crave the pho here.   I've also tasted the bun (get the #3!), which are vermicelli noodles with pork (think deconstructed banh mi) and man... the way the pork grease soaks in to the noodles... delicious.   The banh mi is $4.50 and is pretty sizeable (6-8\"). It's called the \"7C\" and has a great taste and combo of meat!  They recently expanded and hired a few new servers, but generally it's the same old Superior Pho. The restaurant owners are awesome. I'm pretty sure they recognize many of my friends... in fact, I just visited this restaurant twice this past weekend."}
{"text":"Someone please explain to me how nearly all the pho restaurants in Ohio ended up in Columbus.  WTF?    At least Cleveland has Superior, which is probably the best spot in the greater Cleveland/Akron area for a displaced Seattlite or West Coaster to get his or her pho fix.    Superior has all the requisite elements of a good ol' Sea-town International District pho haunt: a strange location, sullen Asian teenager servers, a dose of griminess, and a bustling pace fueled by a non-ending stream of hungry phonatics.      You won't find much to fault in the pho:  the broth, the driving force in any pho restaurant, is rich, meaty, and sweetened appropriately with just the right touch of five spice, and the pho tai meat is cut thin and left rare enough so that it finishes cooking in your bowl.   Noodles are never overcooked, and veggies are always crisp and fresh.   The large pho tai is an eight dollar hangover-be-gone on a Sunday afternoon, time-tested and fool-proof.    I do have to pick on Superior Pho for a moment, but only because I love them.  It is inexcusable for a place of their caliber to not supply pho ramekins at the table for your sauces.  Instead you are forced to ask a sultry server (sometimes twice) for a makeshift version, which as times ends up being a plastic to-go ramekin, and other times is a clumsy soup cup. Wholly unsatisfying to those of us who prefer not to squirt sauce into the soup, and instead follow the Vietnamese way of dipping the meat in a separate sauce vessel."}
{"text":"Superior Pho is not my first choice in Cleveland to get Pho, but it doesn't mean that it's not a 5 star rating restaurant.  You can't beat the quality of food you get for the price.    Everytime I order a large Pho, it's filled to the brim in broth and meat sometime's its challenging to finish the entire thing.   My favorite pho is the large number 3 with meatballs, with a Bahn Mi sandwitch  to go.  My girlfriend LOVES it here too. Maybe loves it too much.     Out of all the places in downtown Cleveland, Superio Pho would the only place I go for Viet food.  And believe me, there's tons of competitors out there, but they don't seem to match."}
{"text":"Can't believe I never review this place even though I've been here for like a bazillion times within 2 years. Definitely one of the best pho places in the greater Cleveland area. Although their location/decoration could make a first-time eater have some doubts, but please don't judge until you've tried their food. For appetizers, try their summer roll or their chicken salad. Both are pretty tasty. As for their main course, usually I go for their pho. My personal favorite is their number 12 pho - include EVERYTHING. But they have a pretty decent selection of different type of phos. Oh and their vietnamese sandwiches are very authentic too. They also serve vermicelli, and rice dishes, they're not bad, but I prefer their pho more. If you're hungry, try the combination meal which includes a variety of things. Trust me you'll be VERY full by the end. Overall, this place is definitely comparable to some NY/Brooklyn pho places. Another great thing about this place is the speed of service. For the price you get, I can't complain. Let's just say that even though this place is about a 30min drive for me, I would come back anytime just for a nice hot bow of noodle soup!"}
{"text":"Best tasting pho in Cleveland even though the restaurant itself (both outside & inside) is kinda ghetto, it has a cool Asian ghetto kinda feel.... It's kinda hard to find, cuz it's inside this plaza with other restaurants & hair/nail saloon .......But back to the pho, I got the #3 pho (mix of #1 brisket & #2 rare rib-eye steak that cooks & turns from red to brown before your eyes in the broth) - both the meat was great quality & thin & flavorful, as well as the broth was very flavorful ....also the cabbage chicken salad was delicious ....and for dessert the bubble tea green tea was amazing :)"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place.  My brother and I went on a Sunday evening.  The dining room was still pretty busy.  We split a bahn mi, and I had a nice bowl of noodles and such. The broth was delicious.  I know the tradition is to dose it up with sriracha and lime juice and whatnot, but honestly if all that fire is not your thing you will not feel like the dish was short on flavor by eating it just the way it is served. Savory, but aromatic with a hint of sweet. Noodle places will never be a serious staple for me, but this is good enough to make an argument to visit more often.  The bahn mi was as good as any I've ever had. He enjoyed one of their plated dishes with some sort of beef. But I think, as the name implies, the soup is the show stopper."}
{"text":"After being on my Cleveland bucket list for years, I've finally made it to Superior Pho! My mom and I really enjoyed our food, but I have to say I've had slightly richer tasting pho broth before. IMO, it's not the best in Cleveland or elsewhere for that matter. Although, this was still some exceptionally satisfying pho! My mom's pork noodle veggie dish was a total win with the peanut sauce.   Will be back very shortly to try other delicious and reasonably priced dishes!"}
{"text":"One of Cleveland's many hidden gems. I recommend a large Number 8 with a Cafe su da. The broth is exceptionally good and the staff are friendly as well. One of my favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"On our travels, we always seek good Pho. Yes, this is exceptionally good. We had the two cabbage salads, one with chicken, one with shrimp. Extraordinary! Beware: kitchen closes at 8:30pm. Sunday 7:30. What a treat!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Pho isn't usually my food of choice, but a friend of mine is obsessed. We had decided to trek to Cleveland for dinner, and I wasn't feeling so well, so when Lolita happy hour (yes, college foodies exist, that's why we balk at five dollar Iron Chef meals) was way too crowded, we drove east to check this out. I had a bit of a sore throat, which made my chicken pho all the better--it was soothing, with a perfect blend of flavor. I ate the entire thing (I know, I know), and next time, when I'm up for more than soup, I'm dying to try the summer rolls and bubble tea. The area was interesting, and the little mall it was located in was adorable. I'd go back ASAP."}
{"text":"Fast service and the broth is excellent. Their bubble tea is also a must try! My friend and I went to cure our hangovers and their pho and bubble tea definitely did the trick. Definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"PROS - Great PHO! -Fast Service -Easy on the wallet/purse - Better fastfood option -Love the price -Love the price -Good portions  CONS -Tight seating (You know us americans can be chub) -Hidden location (not so much a con) -Bad lighting -Will seat you with random people  Overall great restaurant for a quick healthier option rather than fast food. I would go again and again and again (but just not for night out on the town)."}
{"text":"This place has seen a lot of positive growth! Don't be afraid to order a meal other than Pho, it has some hidden treasures. Great service , great food, and amazing bubble tea. Our server Carrie made us feel welcome!"}
{"text":"The food here is great! I love their banh mi and #10 pho!! But why why whyyyyy do you close so early every night?! My pho cravings don't usually kick in until after 8pm :("}
{"text":"Dropped to 2 Stars due to my visit today. Up 'til now I've been SP's biggest fan, but I'm afraid they may have fallen into a \"cheaper ingredients, higher profit\" business model.   First I discovered, to my immense disappointment, that their Banh Mi is no longer made on a crunchy-crust, French baguette-style roll. Today it was constructed on a soft Subway-ish bit of bread.    Next I found the torn off corner of a plastic bag mixed into my pho, suggesting some sort of prepackaged ingredient (beef broth perhaps?)  Please, please go back to what made you worthy of 5 Stars."}
{"text":"Superior has become a regular weekly ritual for us. The service is fast and attentive, the pho is always amazing and the owners are great people. It's hard to go wrong with the #3 and an iced Vietnamese coffee."}
{"text":"Pho here is very good.  Summer rolls are too.  Tried bubble tea for the first time...strawberry was great."}
{"text":"Broth was good. Not too bad. The habanero was craZy hot. I ended up drinking most of the boba. I was expecting tendons but they don't have it. My last pho was in LA at 4th and western."}
{"text":"Yummy medicine for body and soul! I was suffering from the worst cold in years the day my brother wanted to bring Mom and me here, so I almost declined, and then decided that soup could do me some good. Good choice. That big bowl of fragrant, steamy broth was just what I needed. Fresh herbs, a little hot sauce and that wonderful broth cut through all that congestion and made me feel so much better. If I enjoyed it in the condition I was in, think how good it is when you're healthy and can taste all the nuances of flavor! Don't miss the egg rolls or spring rolls, pick your favorite meats and enjoy a true comfort food that transcends culture or geography."}
{"text":"Amazing! The best pho in Cleveland!  The chicken cabbage salad is outstanding too."}
{"text":"Looking for a hot bowl of savory pho? Or banh mi or Vietnamese coffee with condensed milk? Whichever delicacy you seek, Superior Pho has it.  Vietnamese restaurants are relatively rare in Cleveland, and though many pho and other Asian noodle dish places continue to pop up, if you're looking for the best Vietnamese cuisine Northeast Ohio offers, look no further!   Located at E. 30th and Superior, Superior Pho is primely nestled among the some of downtown's best Asian restaurants and markets. Though the neighborhood isn't the greatest, parking to Superior Pho is very accessible (behind the building on Superior), and the staff is more than willing to chase away any suspect characters that may be lingering behind the building (no joke).  As for the food, no other Vietnamese restaurant seems to top the quality and affordability offered by Superior Pho. For just $6.95 you can treat your taste buds to a piping hot bowl of savory pho. (Pronounced \"fuh,\" as in \"fun.\") As is standard, each bowl comes complete with additional accessories -- bean sprouts, mint leaves, lime, hot sauce, and your choice of meat, if wanted.  Having been introduced to authentic pho at one of our nation's Vietnamese cultural capitals, New Orleans, Louisiana, where many Vietnamese political refugees were transplanted during the Vietnam Conflict, I was a bit skeptical about how good Cleveland pho could be. (Interesting tidbit: take a trip out into the countryside of New Orleans East and be amazed at what you see -- modern settlements and farms that have striking resemblance to contemporary Vietnamese countryside, rice paddies. Its a cultural gem.) Though Cleveland's more recent Americanized pho pop-ups and even Pho #1, which is located next to Superior Pho, have disappointed in comparison to Nola pho, Superior's dish has presented itself as a true outlier -- and one of uncanny quality. Indeed it is difficult to directly compare when so far from Nola, yet after just my fifth bowl of Superior pho, it's sincerely hard not to admit that this Cleveland dish is indeed \"superior\" to any pho I've ever tasted. It's just so savory, and no one sip of broth or bite of noodle tastes identical to another. Each sip explodes with clues of wonderfully competing favors.  Grade: A+, because this place is just too much PHO-N"}
{"text":"I got takeout here on a weekday evening. It was so fast and good! I called and they said it would be ten minutes. I got there in 7min and they had it all ready and packaged up. We got two of the well done brisket phos (#1) and a bahn mi thit sandwich. I was hesitant to get pho for takeout because I wondered if they would be able to package it well. Would it get soggy? And most importantly - would I still get all the goodies on the side like the bean sprouts, basil, lime, and jalapeno slices. Yes! They have all the packagings they need (plus some of it is so nice I kept it). The broth was separate from the noodles and meat so then you mix them yourself at home. And the other side goodies I mentioned were all in there in a separate bag as well. And it was sooo good on a cold night. Their broth is great, kind of get a cinnamon vibe from it so maybe that's in there. I might try the chicken as the meat in the pho next time I go. The brisket is good but I'm thinking I might like chicken better mostly because it might be in smaller pieces so easier to eat. Will get again."}
{"text":"I had lunch at Superior Pho with some friends the other weekend and after one meal there, I'm sold. I would happily dine at Superior Pho at any given opportunity (and have been daydreaming about a return lunch pretty much since I walked out the door.) I had a small Pho Chin, which came with brisket, and was much larger than it's \"small\" signifier would lead you to believe. The pho was accompanied by a plate of fresh bean sprouts, thai basil, and chilies. Sriracha, hoisin, chopsticks, and spoons are all kept right at the table for your convenience.   My pho was beautifully flavored -- I love mild, refreshing foods, so I didn't feel compelled to add any spices. Next time I go back (and there will definitely be a next time!), I may mix things up. The brisket in my pho was tender, plentiful, and sliced paper-thin. I can't wait to go back -- next time I plan to get one of the combo meals (a bowl of pho accompanied by banh mi.)  The only reason I'm giving Superior Pho four stars instead of five is because I normally wait to have more than one dining experience at a restaurant before giving it a five star review. My companions and I also weren't particularly wowed by the service -- once our pho was delivered, it was like we were forgotten about."}
{"text":"After checking out some of the other Pho restaurants in town, I'd have to say that I agree with the name. This place is the best if you want a good bowl of pho. It's not the best if you're looking for atmosphere - it's a little hole in the wall."}
{"text":"Superior Pho, indeed.  I haven't had pho since leaving the Bay area in June '08.  And oh pho, how I've missed you.  But not anymore.  Superior Pho is the business!  Fantastic pho!  I can't say enough. The broth was spot on.  The noodles perfectly cooked.  Everything was perfect save the sandwich.  While the filling was perfect, the bread seemed a little rough, maybe even a little stale (hence the 4 stars instead of 5).  I'm going to chalk the bread up to a fluke in the kitchen because I have no doubt that the folks at Superior Pho know what they're doing.  I'll definitely be back.  If the sandwich is all good, I'll change the ranking up to 5 stars."}
{"text":"Being from San Jose, I've grown up eating a lot of Pho, especially since it is one of my dad's favorite foods. So moving out all the way to Cleveland I was pleased to see that I could still satisfy any pho cravings I had, and I ended up eating here many times throughout the years.  I can't exactly explain it, but my general feeling is that the pho here is not as good as the pho I have back at home. Maybe I'm just biased, and it is such a minor difference, so we'll just set that thought aside. It is still the most filling and comforting food that is perfect on a cold day. Plus it is at such a reasonable price point, which is all a poor college student can really ask for.  A lot of people like ordering the #12 pho, because it comes with all the meats, but since I don't like all the meat (especially tripe!) I would usually get the #6 or #7 (small $8.25). If you don't want pho, I would recommend ordering 3C, which is pretty much rice with deliciously marinated pork  ($9.95). It is sweet and savory, which is my favorite flavor combination. But if you want the best value, definitely order one of the combination meals, which will pretty much feed you for 2 meals for only a fraction more money.  On a final note, the service is always really friendly, and the food comes fast. Definitely a solid go-to place for a quick bite, or a pick me up on a cold winter day in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today with a friend.  Food was great, but service was a bit slower than I'd like for lunchtime.  I'll definitely return, but maybe for dinner."}
{"text":"You don't have to venture to Saigon or the Central Highlands to sample a taste of Southeast Asia. This rhetorically named restaurant is an elusive gem amidst a rock strewn dessert of various choices; however, it is a must try for those who enjoy Vietnamese food, or simply for the adventurous types who want something outside the normal realm of Asian fare here in NE Ohio.  First and foremost, if you need a caffeine fix, then the Vietnamese coffee (made with sweetened condensed milk and quite strong) is an excellent choice! Being a vegetarian, I like Pho because it is light, yet flavorful and satisfying. I usually get the vegetarian Pho, which comes in a large bowl and is generously portioned with carrots, celery, and other vegetables! There are a variety of other dishes as well, so if Pho doesn't float your boat, perhaps rice will! The only question is now, what are you waiting PHO?"}
{"text":"This place is delicious...the broth needs a bit more seasoning but the banh mi is so frigging delicious we ate like 3 of those. We also ate like 5 plates of spring rolls...loved the servers and the atmosphere and even went during the freaking snowstorm. Just dont like it being closed on Monday haha just because I barely go out to Cleveland and was there on a monday and really wanted some pho .... but besides that yummmmie...but because they were closed I went to Bac ...was pretty okay too"}
{"text":"I was not terribly impressed. The pho was ok. The broth was a little light. No garlic, no cinnamon. It wasn't bad it just wasn't a great or memorable lunch. The service was a little hectic. I ordered the lunch combo 1, pho with meatballs with a spring roll and tea. Someone put a double order of spring rolls on my table and then fled. Someone else came and dropped two plates of sprouts and jalapenos with lemon on my table and also beat a hasty retreat. My $9.95 lunch combo ended up being $13.00. Whatever. I'm not going to argue. The waitress got it wrong but they did bring me an extra spring roll. I won't pay an extra $3.00 for a spring roll again."}
{"text":"I probably agree with most of the comments below. Great pho. Haven't had any other pho in Cleveland but it is definitely comparable to the many heaping bowls I've had in NYC.   Flavorful, light broth. Fresh bean sprout and dandelion. Chunks of fatty beef. And of course I loaded mine with sriracha :-)  Service was good. Atmosphere is exactly EXACTLY what I want every one of my pho experiences to be like. Hidden in an asian strip mall within a nondescript building. 10 seats with tables. A single register next to one room kitchen with single beverage cooler. Beverage cooler had some really tasty looking wines too!"}
{"text":"I'm having a hard time writing this review because everything has already been said about this place.   Best pho I've had. I've had # 1 pho but Superior is far superior (I think someone even said that already).   I feel like a really stupid American when I eat pho though. I don't like to slurp and I get weirded out when it splashes on me. My grandmother would kill me if she saw me eating that way.   Portions are huge.   Service is great.   Food is really yummy.   Atmosphere isn't the best but who cares. You probably wouldn't want to take a first date (or second date) out for pho anyway.  They have bubble tea in several different flavors. I'm probably the only person on the planet that thinks bubble tea is kinda gross. I do NOT want to be chewing on balls, sorry. Next time, I'll ask them to hold the balls, perhaps?"}
{"text":"The simple sandwiches are the standout at this place. They have combos at very reasonable prices, which is probably why they are so highly rated. The service is good, the food is good, tho not my fave."}
{"text":"Yummy. This place is like a hole in the wall restaurant. It's more like a cafe because the space is small, and it's very casual. I went with my family for lunch, and ordered a summer role and the #6 pho. Both were delicious. I put some hot sauce and oyster sauce in my soup as well for more flavor. The meat was cooked perfectly and the broth was very tasty. I got a large which was huge, but I took home the leftovers which was still just as good the second time around. I wish they put more noodles in, but it was still a decent amount. Great Vietnamese place to check out !"}
{"text":"Had never experienced cuisine like this before but afer my first lunch there I was hooked.  Have been back a number of times and we continue to go back for dinners.  With our cold winters Pho is a welcomed, warm treat."}
{"text":"Not sure if its the best pho ever. But its damn good and cheap. Waitress was nice. there was a leak in the ceiling like a foot away from our table. very small place. I was scared i was going to splash the people next to me from the slurping. i will def come back."}
{"text":"STILL THE BEST  A Vietnamese pho restaurant really doesn't get any better that this place.  Today we had Meal #5 and Meal #10 with a side of bô bia. We ate everything & took the 2 Vietnamese sandwiches to go and & devoured them at the airport. Everything was delicious and  worked out perfectly.  I wish we had a place this good near us in Florida."}
{"text":"This is the best pho around. The only better I have had is in Chinatown in San Francisco. Quick service and good prices. I'd eat here everyday if I could!!"}
{"text":"My first time experience wasn't all that great but I came back for the second time and my thoughts have changed for the better. The service is fast and it's not that fancy restaurant so don't have to dress up. It's one of those hole-in-the-wall places so you eat and you go. There's no music either so it's just people minding their own business and eating!   I ordered their pho again and it tasted much better this time. I have yet to try their banh mi because every time I eat pho, i always end up being full. The broth tasted homemade so it was well worth the price. Reasonable prices and located right next to Ha Anh Korean place."}
{"text":"This was my first time having pho, banh mi and bubble tea so I don't have anything to compare to however, all three were awesome!!! The bread on the sandwich was super! I am a crusty bread freak and this was amazing! My husband got the pho and loved it (filled him so much that he got his sandwich wrapped to eat later) he enjoyed adding the sprouts to get a nice crunch. My 3 and 4.5 year olds split a banh mi (without chilies) and liked them, but the bubble tea!! They thought it was the coolest thing ever! Mango was an awesome choice and the \"bubbles\" were a bit odd but I still liked it. (my husband hated the texture, but he hates gummy things, he still loved the mango smoothie part)  Like everyone else said it is in an odd spot and it's not a pretty place, but the service was fast and efficient and the food was wonderful.  We will be back the next time we go to a museum. :)"}
{"text":"I wish I had know about this place a long time ago because it is now my go to spot for lunch in Cleveland. The pho is the best pho I've had before. Very simple but the flavor is amazing. The place can be hard to find: it's inside of a strip mall like building. Trust me, make the journey to superior pho!"}
{"text":"I've been a loyal diner for four years and always take out of town guests here during their stay. The food is both excellent and consistent, and the staff and owner are great people. My favorites on the menu are the Pho and the Bahn Mi, though you really can't go wrong with anything here. I've lived in some pretty awesome food towns such as Chicago and Toronto, and Superior Pho ranks near the top of my all time favorites.   Two notes on the food. The pho broth is always very richly flavored and wonderful, so be careful to taste it before you add in any hoisin or sriracha--I think it is better by itself. The Bahn Mi has some really wonderful pate and cured pork in it along with other delights, and I wouldn't miss a taste of it. There's a special on the menu with both the Bahn Mi and Pho that I have if I've got a big appetite. Heaven!"}
{"text":"This place has the best pho i've had in Cleveland. Wait times are never long and the servers are always nice. If you think you should go to that other pho place right by this one, pho-get about it! Superior pho is the best."}
{"text":"In addition to my usual small bowl of Pho (#7 with brisket and flank), I ordered the cabbage chicken salad on this visit.....AMAZING.   Marinated crunchy cabbage, with shredded chicken, and veggies, topped with crushed dry roasted peanuts and mixed with a fish sauce (I think) based dressing.   The perfect accompaniment!"}
{"text":"I am from Dallas, TX -- a place where you can find tons of good pho restaurants.  Here in cleveland, I found that choices are very limited.  Out of the very few pho places here, Superior Pho got to be the best.  My friends and I like to come here (specially in the winter) for some good pho.  Their selections on the menu are not as good as what I used to get in Dallas, but definitely enough to make me happy.  The location is very hidden.  It is located in this very smaller building, you can never find it if you are just driving by on the main streets.  Just like other Pho restaurants, don't expect too much service but you can sure get some good pho here.  Price is OK, but definitely cheaper than Number One Pho."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best pho shops in CLE. Quality meats and very good broth and noodles."}
{"text":"Down to pho? I hope that the morning after a long night out, your answer will be a resounding \"Yes!\"  If you don't know what you're looking for, it's easy to miss both the front and back entrance to this joint in the mini-mini-mall that sprouts like a self-assured weed amidst the surrounding warehouses. But one look around at the other Asian eateries crammed into the building is enough to confirm that you have indeed found the right place.   Superior Pho's two dining rooms are always circulating an endless stream of families, friends, and new acquaintances looking for a hearty bowl of Vietnamese soup noodles. The menu looks long, but is quite cleanly divided into categories that you'd expect at a Vietnamese restaurant. Plus the added bonus of slushy bubble tea drinks. Keep the ticket stub your waiter leaves on the table! You'll need it to pay.   First timers, you know what you came for, so skip ahead to the Pho section. I've tried the small size Ph tái chín (#3), which includes brisket and eye round steak. I was skeptical when I didn't see the trademark green lacquer chopsticks in the utensil holder, and our waiter didn't bring out the small sauce dishes until we asked later, but this noodle soup gets a grade A. For the true native, the soup would probably only get a passing grade since it's not as aromatic and basil-y as I'm accustomed to, but I like my broth with a more meat flavor. The noodles are just thick and chewy enough to satisfy with every bite, and the beef was a nice, tender complement. I paired my pho with a Mango Bubble Tea. Wonderful choice, if I do say so myself! After tasting the Lychee (pronounced LEE-chee, not LIE-chi as our waiter repeated to our horrified gazes) Bubble Tea as well, I'm 80% convinced their other flavors are well worth your money as well. As I mentioned before, it's more of a slushy consistency than a liquid, but this doesn't impact the texture of the tapioca balls or real fruit flavor at all. Bottom line, just get it. :)  On subsequent trips I tried the Tamarind Noodle Soup, Gi cun (Summer Rolls w/ Shrimp) and Bì cun (Summer Rolls w/ Shredded Pork). These are both LARGE rolls wrapped in clear, squishy rice paper (and hence different from their spring roll counter parts, which are fried). One per person may be enough of an appetizer if they come out at the same time as your entree. I personally liked the Summer Rolls with Pork better, and my friends and I agree it pairs better with the peanut sauce rather than fish sauce. The Tamarind is a tart, sour soup that's great for detoxing (yet still surprisingly filling), but I'd stick with the Pho if you can eat meat.   When you're done and feel like you can move again, bring your ticket stub to the cashier and pay - separately or together. Leave with a happy stomach."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food.  Service was superb.....what else can one ask for?"}
{"text":"If this review was based solely on the pho, it would be borderline 4/4.5. Combined with the customer service (1.5/2), this review averages 3/3.5.   The pho: Coming from the SF Bay Area (& coming from a Vietnamese background), I have very high standards for the pho broth. Comparing it only to local pho restaurants in the area, this is probably topping the charts for this area only. I have been here a few times, and once the broth came out milky and was very subpar. But the other times, the broth was always on point. They serve all the standard meats with their pho dac biet (combination pho), except for the tendon. If you want tendon, you'll need to request it separately, and when you do, they dump at least a cup of tendon all over your pho, thereby diluting the savory taste of tendon and pho because now you have all these pieces of tendon clouding your pho. Tendon in pho is usually melt in your mouth buttery soft, but their tendon, I can't quite put my tongue on their method, but it tastes like they partially roast it after boiling it? It isn't melt in your mouth buttery soft, you actually taste the chewy-ness of the tendon. Two different ways to eat tendon, however I prefer the former.  The customer service: I am constantly frustrated with having to order pho from this place. Eating the pho, great! Ordering the pho, not so great. The first time I ordered pho, I called in a to-go order for a family dinner. I ordered the \"pho dac biet\" and the gentleman on the phone kept asking me to repeat myself... \"What was that?\" \"I don't understand you.\" \"What is it exactly that you want?\" and when I repeated myself for the 2nd or 3rd time, he said, \"Sorry, we don't have that here.\" A pho restaurant doesn't have pho? Frustrated, I ended up calling a to-go order from somewhere else.  The second time my husband ordered, same thing, ordered pho dac biet. He had a hard time placing the phone order with the gentleman as well. Had to repeat himself multiple times.  The third time, we ordered in person. Told the waitress, \"Pho dac biet\" and she said to just give her the number to the item. We also asked her for scissors to cut up the noodles for a 1 year old to eat with a spoon (since a 1 year old can't use a fork or chopsticks). She brought us a butter knife. When we asked for scissors again, she said, \"I'll bring you another butter knife.\" Okay? Did she plan on having us jerry-rig two butter knives to make a simple pair of scissors to cut up noodles? When we tried explaining why we needed the scissors to cut up the noodles for the baby, she said she couldn't bring scissors. Did not even bother to check with someone else, or with the owners who were probably in the back.   This would be the equivalent of going to a Mexican restaurant and ordering a carne asada burrito and the waiter/tress not knowing what that is, or going to an Italian restaurant and ordering pasta with bolognese sauce and the waiter/tress not knowing what that is, or going to a Chinese restaurant and ordering fried rice and the waitre/tress not knowing what that is. It is very frustrating to eat somewhere and order from them when the staff does not even know what the restaurant serves and instead relies on numbers on the menu.  Note: This review is my opinion based on my experience only and may not reflect on the business as a whole. What experience I had may not be the same for someone else."}
{"text":"PHO SHO!!!!!!!! I love Superior Pho. It's such an easy go-to when you are feeling like you need a little broth in your life. I have tried 2 of the phos so far ( chicken and the #12) and while I highly enjoy them, I believe they could step it up as far as flavor goes. That is my ONLY complaint. Their fried rice is the absolute best I have ever had. It is so fresh and doesn't taste fried in the least bit. The authenticity of the joint is on point.l  I love the bubble tea and the service is always speedy and nice. Definitely a watering hole of mine that my husband and I frequent--especially during the colder months!"}
{"text":"haha, totally can't beat Matthew M's review so I won't even try!  Superior Pho isn't just named Superior because of the avenue it's located on, it truly is some of the best Pho I've ever had....I would like to try other things on their menu but my craving for good Pho may just prevent that from ever happening!  Huge bottles of sriracha on the table gets it that 5th star  ;o)  Boba tea too....Passion fruit and Taro are both a hit!  Come and try it out...."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Best place to go get Pho! Everything on the menu is simply amazing.  Try the Bubble Tea and also the Banh Mi. Staff are very friendly and the atmosphere is great!  Definitely try it out!"}
{"text":"Stopped by on an east coast road trip.  The soups were amazing and the small a were large enough for one.  I had the chicken with mine and it was well worth the stop.  The place was dead, so the service was good."}
{"text":"After reading all these yummy yelp reviews I figured I needed to try this out for myself. My experience with Pho prior to this was nonexistent. So I opted for the #12 based on prior reviews ; this  has basically every possible meat choice except meatballs. I also ordered the summer rolls. Initially I was going to get this order to go but since this was my first time there the guy who took my order insisted it would be better to try it there. Which btw service was great, staff took the time to explain the menu items to me and helped me make my selections. Food arrived very quickly. The summer rolls were light and tasty and the peanut sauce was a nice accompaniement (I generally do not like nuts in my food but on this rare occassion I actually enjoyed it). So next comes the pho. The portion is HUUUUGE! You can easily split this. But seeing as I came solo, I took the rest as a parting gift. This came with limes and bean sprouts and mint on the side. The pho was delightful I especially enjoyed the brisket. I committed something of a pho-pas when attempting to eat this soup. OMG so messy! I dont see how ppl can manage this with just chop sticks. Next time I go back I would like to try their banh mi."}
{"text":"I don't know a whole lot about Vietnamese food; Superior Pho was probably my second or third ever experience with the cuisine. But this place is certainly a tasty bargain, especially in the case of the combination meals. I had the bahn mi thit and the pho ga and enjoyed both, although I felt that the pho was rather simple and could have benefited from some additional flavors. I particularly recommend the bahn mi, as the simple acidic flavors really stood out amongst the delicate pork. Additionally, the perky and friendly service is a huge plus."}
{"text":"There's not much more I can say about the food that hasn't already been said.  This place rocks. I love that you need a treasure map to find the place. I miss the bakery next door :(  The Bahn Mi is excellent. The pho is serene. YUM  My only complaint (and loss of a star) is that the service could be better. I waited for about 15 mins before I could catch anyone's eye to give me a to-go box for my enormous soup. I also would have liked to have been told that I didn't need to wait for a check. That I should just go up to the counter and pay. There doesn't seem to be dedicated servers either. They just all do everything. A bit chaotic.   Great food though - highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I don't buy the hype.  My best brother in the world suggested it as a Michael Symon haunt.  Claiming the legendary Cleveland Iron Chef would pick up Superior Pho for his employees as take away.  Started out that I parked next to Number One Pho.  Very close in address, but not the same place.  Not even close.  Superior Pho is in a dumpy, dirty and dingy plaza...wiring coming out of the ceiling, dirt and grime on the floor.  Sat down and ordered.  Our waiter seemed completely disinterested.  He kindly forgot my drink order and left me parched.  The menu is a tough read.  Thank God yelpers posted quality photos of all the Pho.  Based on the Yelp photos I ordered spring rolls and chicken noodle Pho.  Both were delivered from the kitchen with lightning speed.  Almost as if they're prepared for the lunch hour, placed on heaters and under warming lights then served.  The Pho was served at that lovely burn your tongue HOT temperature.  Killing all the taste buds.  I looked for my server, the one that forgot the drink order, but low and behold it was delivery time, and he was carting in food on a two-wheel dolly from outside.  What convenient timing.  A good restaurant with a good server would handle it differently.  Something like this, \"Hi folks, just wanted to check in with you...I have to run out and get the deliveries, but my associate here will cover for me while I'm out,\" and introduce their co-worker as your new server.  To Superior Pho's credit, they did comp the drink at the end.  Once the Pho cooled down, it was good, but our server failed in offering any silverware, or even so much as a spoon."}
{"text":"Looking for somewhere to eat that wasn't fast food or extreme on the pocket book and also soupy for the cold day we were experiencing, I yelped and found this place.  However, we were a little confused (should have read more reviews) on how to find the place.  We parked out front, but didn't see a sign and asked the beauty store ppl where this place was located and they told us to go through that door, around the corner to the right.   Okaaaay - we walk through what looked like a deserted restaurant in a building definitely not up to code, past some restrooms and boom, on the right was the restaurant in what looked like an aquarium as the wall was floor to ceiling glass.    We were seated quickly at a table for 6 and provided a menu with numerous items.  Overhearing others order, we figured a combo would be the best route to go.  We both ordered the #7 pho, #4roll and tea.  A few moments later they seat another patron with us at the end of the table which didn't bother us, however, if you're not into community dining, this isn't the place for you.  Our orders arrived and I have to admit, as the pho broth is good, it isn't great and they don't have chile in oil - booooo.   The grilled pork summer roll was just ok, it wasn't my fave at all, I definitely had better.   They provide you only chile, lime, sprouts, and basil for your pho.  I'm used to all of the above plus celery, mint, and green beans.  Oh well, it was cold, we wanted soup, we got soup."}
{"text":"First off I am in love with Superior Pho! I'm addicted! If I lived closer I would eat it every day and go broke haha. I seem to go at least on average once a month either with my self or my father. I have always just ordered the same thing and I don't want to try others and possibly not like it as much as my go to order. I get Meal 10 ~ $13.50 Vietnamese sandwich and Large Ph of your choice Soda / diet soda / iced tea The bah mi sandwich is to die for. I love putting the plum or hoison sauce and sirachi on the roll and chowing down. Now to the Pho. Two meats well done brisket and eye of round steak placed right on top half cooked half still pink with a very seasoned stock and rice noodles. Throw in some thai basil some bean sprouts extra lime juice for me. I like to put the plum sauce on my noodles as I pull them out with my chopsticks. I've also tried an appetizer ordered 1A. Gi cun (two per order) ~ $4.50 Summer rolls with shrimp, fresh herbs, vermicelli noodles, wrapped in rice paper skin, served with peanut sauce. At least two different times. Very good except the texture of the rice paper rolls throws me off sometimes. the staff is always polite friendly and fast. One time my 6 month old son accidentally knocked over the fish sauce jar and it went all over the place. They did not seem mad at us and quickly cleaned it up for us(I was embarrassed lol) There are other pho places bu when ever I i think to try another place my gut feeling is to just stick with Superior pho. Always want to try bubble tea but as of now have not tried it. You know its a good place when you constantly seeing a lot of there customers are actually of Asian decent. To me that speaks volumes and it has to be close to what they would eat back home or must be comfort food for them. Overall I would give them more then the 5 stars yelp allows for!"}
{"text":"Wow. This place is good. Really good. I've heard about Superior Pho from celebrity chefs Alton Brown and Michael Symon. I feel bad for doubting them. I mean, how good can Vietnamese food be in Cleveland, Ohio? I am surrounded by authentic Vietnamese restaurants in Los Angeles, so I never thought it would be worth it to give this place a try. I am so glad that I recently did during my last trip to Cleveland! This place is located in a little strip mall in Asiatown, near the corner of 30th and Superior. You can easily miss this place if you aren't actively looking for it. The interior of the restaurant is pretty minimalist. The menu offers plenty of Vietnamese specialties, but they are most known for their pho. So, I ordered the pho ga, which features white meat chicken as the protein component of the soup. This soup is phenomenal. All of the other pho I've had in my life pales in comparison to this. I think what makes this stand out is the broth. It is so flavorful, complex and comforting. The noodles and chicken are also delicious and the soup is served with the traditional accouterments on the side. The prices are very fair, and in my mind a bargain. For just under $8 you get a ginormous bowl of soup. They label this bowl as \"small\". I don't know how big the large bowl is, but the small bowl is definitely more than enough for one person! So, in short, believe the hype. This place is absolutely amazing. Always trust Alton Brown and Michael Symon for restaurant recommendations. And, lastly, I'm sorry for underestimating Cleveland's ability to produce authentic Vietnamese food!"}
{"text":"People of Cleveland you have been mislead ! The food here is bland . I come from the west coast California where there are tons of pho places that will run circles around this place . My pho had no taste. Meat potions was ok noodles was ok. Ordered spring roll it was really soggy possibly made from previous day(s) food was ok at best. Also outside is a bad neighborhood with crack heads, drug dealer and prostitute ."}
{"text":"I had No.12 for large, everything except for meatball. Beef tasted tender and good. However, their broth was really not special. It tasted pretty bland...which is pretty disappointing because broth is the most important part for pho. I wasn't sure why it was rated so high on help. I honestly wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Forget about it.   The four best restaurants in the city of Cleveland: Nate's on W25th Red Steakhouse L'Albatros  ... and Superior Pho.  Great job, all around. Great food, speedy service. have been there too many times to count. Bahn Mi and pho is just excellent.   Only two bad things: parking lot is a cluster f*ck after this winter and don't get carry out. Just doesn't taste the same."}
{"text":"Decided to get take out and was very impressed by the presentation. 15 min drive home and the food was still hot. Definitely coming here again. Try the red bean bubble tea....delicious! The food is simply amazing."}
{"text":"The hype is REAL, all the reviews and newspaper articles calling this the best restaurant in Cleveland. I've been moved away for almost a decade but I was able to make it here over thanksgiving break after reading all about it.   Since I was only going to make it here once in my foreseeable I ordered as fat as possible.   Spring Rolls: Great spring rolls that were very fresh and had a delicious sauce  Pho: wayyy toooo Phocking good. Some of the best broth I've ever had, Barely needed any spice or veggies added to be delicious  Bahn Mi: humongous and pretty cheap!   Bubble Tea: I ordered a mixed flavor of Coconut and Taro and it was delicious, I made all my friends try it and they liked it too.   I will definitely try to make this a tradition every time I'm back in the LAND"}
{"text":"I would eat Pho with my foe's faux folks.  Oh Superior Pho how do I love thee let me count the ways  Consistently fast service Amazing selection of Pho Pho that can't be beat Limes, basil, and bean sprouts fresh on the table More Pho than I can imagine eating at once BEEF mmm BEEF Spoons and chopsticks galore Tea by the pot I never leave without a full tummy All for less than 10 bucks a person  Thank you Superior Pho for making my taste buds sing."}
{"text":"There's not much to say about Superior Pho, so I'll keep it short and sweet. It's off the beaten path, hidden in an alley, in the back of a building. It's small, used to look like a hole in the wall, but they've spruced the place up a tiny bit - still not the place for elegance, service is okay... but they have the best damn pho in Cleveland! I just wish they were open late."}
{"text":"I've been a staunch fan and steady customer of Superior Pho for many, many years, going back to when it was called Pho Hoa.  Superior Pho, hands down, is the best Vietnamese restaurant in Cleveland.  Their  phó is sublime, and all of the other dishes are top notch.  The owners care deeply about the quality and consistency of their food and it shows.    Superior Pho has earned a spot in my family as a \"second kitchen\", our go-to place for both comfort food and for showing off to out-of-towners the top notch quality of the cuisine that can be had in Cleveland.  Everyone we've brought here has become a believer!."}
{"text":"The big bowl of pho with the slices of beef was excellent. My wife ordered a spicy bowl and she didnt like it. I didnt like it as well, the spicey flavor really smacked ya in the face. I will definitely return seeing as i absolutely loved my bowl of pho!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat. I always get what I got the first time (back when it was Pho Hua) a #10 Pho Hua soup, a vietnamese sandwich and one or more ice coffees. I muddle a couple basil leaves against the inside of the bowl with the soup spoon and squeeze in as many lime slices as my group will let me have. In my opinion this is the best Pho in town."}
{"text":"There was a cute little caterpillar on our basil.  It looked like it was enjoying the basil leaves thoroughly.  Didn't appear that the restaurant washed any of the vegetables that were served with our pho.  At least we know it is all natural"}
{"text":"Fantastic Pho! Had the #12 Pho, shrimp spring rolls, and a passion fruit bubble tea....SO GOOD! Food quality is phenomenal, service is fast, nice ace casual place to go by yourself or with friends. I'll be back again for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Came back with my friend and had the opportunity to try some other dishes including the  Chicken cabbage salad - 5 stars Summer Roll - 4 stars and Pho (with ribeye) - 4 stars w/soda ALL for $12.95!  I was seated immediately, food came out in less than 5 minutes."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with this place! Food is amazing. Service is spectacular. Try the China tea. You know when you are eating Asian food and you're surrounded by only Asians you are eating the good stuff!  :)"}
{"text":"I can see why Superior Pho is the best pho restaurant in Cleveland. The food was fantastic. (I had the pho with a pork shank.)   Service was timely, and the staff even let me pay the bill for my table, without my table knowing. They were great sports and it was an all around wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Overall, solid spot for pho. We had the #7 and #8 pho with beef. Our food came out really quick and was warm and steaming. The side of toppings, fresh mint, bean sprouts, and jalapeños, was large and more than enough for two. The noodles were perfect and delicious, some of the brisket was bit dry but makes sense for that cut. I was a little disappointed with the flavor of the broth, it was less flavorful than I'm used to. Still really good comfort food and at a great price! We also tried the summer rolls for an app and they were great.  Note: this place is tricky to find from Superior, it's in the plaza with the red awning. You can turn onto 31st from superior and find their parking lot on the left, you'll see a larger sign for a Korean restaurant and they're in the same building."}
{"text":"First and foremost: This is the BEST pho place. It's far \"superior\" than other places in NE Ohio!  If you haven't tried pho, this is the place to go. All other pho places will not match up once you've tasted the pho here.  The broth here is the best, its flavorful with great texture and smell. Although the consistency varies from time to time, it has not disappointed me. In other words, its from a scale of better to best every time!   The large #12 is my favorite. It has the sliced round eye beef, beef tendons, beef brisket, & flank steak. It's served in a large bowl with plenty of the heavenly broth and of course noodles. Garnished with the usually greens & onions. It's served with a side of bean sprouts, basil leaves, jalapeños, and sliced lime (although, you sometimes get lemon). A large pho is quite filling, if you're seeking for a bigger portion, you can make it an extra large!  The table has silverware and sauces where you can create your own flavor. I usually mix 70/30 of hoisin sauce and sriracha in a second soup spoon for dipping in the meats. Years ago, I would add the sauces to the broth directly, but this would sometimes ruin the flavor of the broth, so I find this method to be better.   Oh BTW, don't come here Mondays, they are closed. You'll have to satisfy your pho craving elsewhere or come Tuesday!"}
{"text":"This is the best pho place in Cleveland, hands down.  I live in Texas now and there are some decent pho places here, but nothing will ever compare to the awesomeness at Superior Pho.  As with most food gems, this place is located in a shady area, but don't let its location fool you.  It's located in a building with a Korean restaurant next door.  The restaurant itself is very nice and clean inside.  Staff is friendly and helpful.  Service is quick - you'll get your big piping hot bowl of pho shortly after you order.  The pho comes with a huge plate of all of the traditional fixings - lime wedges, jalapeno slices, cilantro, bean sprouts and Thai basil.  Sriracha, hoisin sauce and other condiments are already on the table.  The broth is savory and perfect.  The meat is sliced thin and is always tender.  The bowls are loaded with noodles.  I have been here many times and I have never had a bad experience here.  They are always consistent with their food.  They have bahn mi, too, along with some other Vietnamese dishes and \"appetizers\" like spring rolls and summer rolls.  I love their pho too much to venture out and try anything else here, but I have had friends order said above items and they had nothing but great things to say about them.  This place also offers Vietnamese coffee and bubble tea!  They even have durian flavored bubble tea if you're into that stuff.  I am definitely not.  The bubble tea is very good and the boba is always perfect.  I also like their coconut jelly drink."}
{"text":"Finally had the opportunity to go here for lunch. Amazing. Everything my wife and I got was fantastic. Be aware, the small Pho is still very large so go hungry."}
{"text":"That moment I realized I haven't reviewed my favorite restaurant in Cleveland.... awkward.  But seriously, this is hands down my absolute favorite food option in the entire Cleveland area. I don't care what time of day it is, what season, what temperature, if someone asks if I want pho the answer is always OH MY GOD YES. I kid you not, you can absolutely NEVER go wrong with Superior Pho, ever. I don't know if they put something in the broth to make it completely and utterly addicting, but once you start eating you cannot stop. Every time I finish a bowl of this stuff I immediately wish I had another.   I can honestly say that any time anyone asks me for the best place to eat in Cleveland, I do not hesitate to say Superior Pho. It is THAT good. If you haven't had it yet, do yourself a favor and get over to Superior Avenue ASAP, you'll thank me later.  Pro tip: Don't be scared of the plum sauce. I didn't try it the first time I went because I had no idea what to expect. Trust me though, it is out of this world. I mean seriously, you need to try it. I eat it by the spoonful... is that weird?"}
{"text":"I would say, I've never had tasty authentic Pho until I had one here at Supeior Pho. The clear soup has such great aroma and intense broth taste, and the eye round beef are so tender. There are about 10 different types of Pho on the menu. I asked the waiter which one is the most common and popular and he said \"Pho tai\" with eye-round steak. The second time, I ordered \"Pho tai chin\" which is a mix of eye-round steak and beef brisket. I think I liked the second one because I get to eat two different kind, tasty beef.  The bean sprout, mint, jalapeno which comes with Pho are very fresh. Pho large size was way too big for my boyfriend, we could share it.  Small size would be enough for women and some men too.   Grilled Shrimp on a broken rice dish is very good for $9. The shrimp is well seasoned/marinated and the dish comes with some lettuce, cucumber and carrots. Everytime we dine there, the service is super fast and we don't have to wait 5 mins til we start eating.   The only thing which can be a problem about this place is that there are always more than 2, 3 flies in the restraunt.  This neighborhood used to be unfamiliar to me but now I have discovered Supeior Pho, it will be fun to shop at nearby chinese markets and shop smart &wise (For example tomatos on vine $1/2 lbs, live Blue crab for $5.99/lb). I really like to eat tasty food for lunch and dinner under $10. This is the place! I cannot wait to visit Supeior Pho and try out something new from their menu next time!"}
{"text":"Pretty good pho.  Broth very tasty Noodles where perfectly cooked Meats where also very good.  It would have been nice to have tendon also available.  The basil and bean sprouts could have been fresher.   Service prompt and quick  Probably the best pho in Cleveland It would be nice for the restaurant to provide little sauce bowls for your hoisin and sriracha sauces. One shouldn't really sauce directly into the bowl."}
{"text":"We visited Cleveland for 3 days, the weather was cold and miserable so we were craving something hot, Asian, and soupy.  After looking at all the raving reviews on Yelp, we decided to try this place out.  Personally, I thought the pho here was only okay; nothing really outstanding.  The broth tasted pretty good, but the noodles seemed like it had been sitting in the bowl for awhile.  Service was also alright, spotty at times.    Overall, the food tasted ok, but I don't think I will be back here if I'm ever back in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Pho! I'm not a pho connoisseur, but this bowl definitely hits the spot! The small bowl is enough for a meal, but I'd recommend getting the large. It's a lot more food and for not that much more cost, and maybe you'll have leftovers! If there's a bunch of people on your table who ordered pho, then they'll combine the veggies onto a single plate, and I feel like you don't get as much as you should. Not a huge deal, but it might be annoying if you really like your bean sprouts.   I've also had their vermicelli noodles with spring rolls and beef. So good! I can eat the whole bowl. The spring rolls are crispy and not too oily, and the whole bowl doesn't feel very heavy at all.    Parking is easy, and I've never had a problem with long waits. It's always easy for me to find someone to get pho with me!"}
{"text":"Have been coming here since it first opened and never tire of the food. Now I am going to say to all the California people who claim they have the best Asian and Mexican, you also have some of the worst. I lived part time in Ohio and part time in Southern California for seven years. I had some God awful Pho in LA. Fat and gristle floating in hot water.   I also have no understanding why a Vietnamese who relocates to California can cook but one who relocates to Ohio cannot. Lets face it, it is not where he lives at all. Ingredients are available all over now a days.   Which leads to Superior Pho. The various soups, rice dishes, sandwiches and salads are excellent. The place is small and busy. You will see Asian mothers with children, local workers on lunch hour and travelers sitting side by side. Service is prompt, staff is polite. Prices are reasonable. Only excuse to not go is if you do not like Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"We like to go here right before noon on Sundays in order to get our table and food before the lunch crowd shows up.  We always leave feeling full and happy.  The 4 star rating is a combination of 5 stars for the Pho, 4 stars for the rest of the menu, and 3 stars for the service, value, and ambience.  Yesterday we had an excellent (by SP standards) server who took our order quickly, brought out the appetizer in two minutes and the soups in another two minutes.  This suits our preference for getting into and out of restaurants quickly, if you are looking for candlelight and strolling violin players you are in the wrong place.  Unfortunately the cashier didn't know how to sell a gift card or process a credit card."}
{"text":"so good! I've ordered pho soup takeout before but I just tried the Bún today (3B) and it was so delicious. Our party of 3 came during lunch time and they were slammed. We waited maybe 5 minutes for a table. Our waitress immediately brought us water and asked if we wanted anything else to drink. They keep it pretty fast paced I think because of the rush hour but she was still very polite, patient, and had a great suggestion for my meal. The fried spring roll in my bowl was the best I have ever had. Despite it being busy there it wasn't loud and we had plenty of room to sit.   I also really enjoyed my pho soup that I ordered as takeout a few months ago. It was really nice that they packed everything separate so nothing gets soggy.  great prices, great atmosphere, great service. I highly reccomend it!"}
{"text":"Amazing pho. QUICK service every time, even when they're full to the last seat. I don't know how they do it.  The Bahn Mi is also always SO delicious and crunchy. MmmMmm. Salivating while thinking about it.  Their bubble tea is decent too; I think it's comparable to Koko bakery's bubble tea down the street."}
{"text":"5 Stars for their banh mi! Sure there is only one kind, but they cram that puppy with lots of delicious pork and other cuts of meat! Sandwiched in between the layers of meat, there is ample pickled radish, carrots, cilantro, and jalapeno! Mmm! I just love that for $4.50, they give you a GENEROUS portion of meat. The mayo isn't overwhelming. In fact, you can't even notice it because it's spread so thinly!  The pho was great, as the cuts of brisket and ribeye were lean and not old. The soup flavors were tasty, but I am speculating that it is instant, or at least, the bowl that I got was the broth towards the bottom of the stock pot (a bit on the dark/cloudy side). However, STILL TASTY and not salty!  These guys are very generous in their portion, as indicated by the two gentlemen that I was with, wharfed down their size small pho bowls in record time, and were full!  If you haven't tried this place out, either if you're local, or just passing through, make sure that you do! Well worth it. :)"}
{"text":"Great Pho all around.  We ordered 3 no.12 large and 1 2C.  Everything is delicious and we are really satisfied."}
{"text":"The Pho tastes great. I always ordered the same combo with a small pho and chicken cabbage sandwich. Had been there many times. For 70% of the time, it's 5 star --the food is great, food comes out fast. But sometimes the pho is not fully cooked and the broth sometimes tastes different. I liked the Chicken salad very much but the taste and serving size always varies.  Their spoons have a very strong smell (disinfectant???) The sprouts are not fresh sometimes. But overall I have good experiences here and will be coming back for the pho."}
{"text":"The pho is superior. It really is delicious. Restaurant is small and definitely not anything fancy but i suppose if I have a place to eat my pho it will suffice ;) The chicken pho is good and probably a safe choice for someone trying pho for the first time (if you like chicken noodle soup you'll likely enjoy this) and the steak is also good. I had a pork spring roll and it wasn't the greatest but it wasn't the worst thing I've ever had. Jalapenos for the win!!!!  Update..  I had the banh mi sandwich for the first time today. It wasn't terrible but I wouldn't order it again. My friend really likes it though. Also, I had the spring rolls again today and I'm definitely not a fan so my trips will be 100% for their delicious pho!"}
{"text":"Whenever I travel to Cleveland, I make an effort to stop by Superior Pho for lunch. The Pho ga is my favorite dish. The basil and peppers are fresh and the small bowl is big enough for me on even my fattest of fat days. Parking is kind of weird and the decor is minimal... But who cares. 5 stars. Boom."}
{"text":"This is one of the better places to get Pho in Cleveland.  It's a tiny hole-in-the-wall.  I started going here when it was little more than a bare room with metal walls and ceilings and very minimal chairs and tables.  Since then, it has become much more classy looking, although it's still essentially a little room with no windows in a tiny mini-mall in an industrial neighborhood.  The lot is in back...it's in the same mini-mall as the Golden Bakery (which is a huge plus--I always get dessert there).  Service has always been good when I've been here.  This place is one of those little secrets that you discover, and then you wonder how in the world you ever discovered it, but you're happy you did."}
{"text":"Better than Mediocre Pho, and wayyyy better than Inferior Pho.  You will be hard pressed to find a Banh Mi that is Superior to Superior, at least in Cleveland terms. Not a whole lot to choose from in these parts, but this is one of the best.  Good Banh Mi sandwiches and nice service at this Vietnamese place inside the awesome Asian food court. Definitely come here for a sandwich if you want to try some of the best Vietnamese sandwiches in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Easily the best place to get pho in Cleveland. I've been here dozens of times and never been disappointed. I've had pho at many other places in many different city's and once you have it hear your standards will definitely rise.  The food comes out quick and hot every time, I have never ordered anything except a number 3 pho bowl because it's that good I can't bring myself to get anything else. It's something to look forward to."}
{"text":"I'm visiting from Detroit and came here based on the high reviews.  Being Vietnamese and seeing that this place got such good reviews for Pho, I was excited.  I was not impressed.  The broth is bland (and I don't eat salty so for me to say that it's bland, it's really bland).  I had to add a lot of hoisin sauce and Siracha.  Any Vietnamese knows good pho needs to have that rich broth.  The noodle was cooked correctly and the meat was fine.  There were hardly any side herbs that was supposed along with the pho.  We also got Banh Mi.  It was bad.  The vegetables were supposed to be pickled, it was not, just cut and served bland.  The quality of the meat was not good.  Tasted like it had been frozen and thawed, had a weird after taste.  The bread did not taste fresh either.  Maybe we came at a bad time, or the food is Americanized, but we were disappointed.  I'm not sure I would come back.."}
{"text":"Ok this place is great! I love soup #11 and #9, bubble tea (taro), and bahn mi sandwich. They do everything really well here and for a price that can't be beat! I come here to get take out or to sit in. Usually sitting in the main room you walk into is the best. I have never enjoyed the back room. I feel it sometimes smells like feet."}
{"text":"Aloha from Hawaii! I was in Cleveland for work and couldn't find anything so I turned to Yelp! I found \"Superior Pho\" to have a great brisket pho noodle soup. Some phos would only give you small portions of meat but I was very happy with the portions they gave me.  So I give them 5/5. I met the owner Chris and he's really chill. He takes pride of his business and makes sure his customers are treat right. Visit them if you r in town!  Mahalo, Jon"}
{"text":"I didn't think Pho came in a non meat version... stupid me lol  I came here for a tasting as part of a yelp event and everything I had taste great. A detailed review will follow after I try this place out fully."}
{"text":"OUTSTANDING Pho noodle soup!  Extremely tasty broth.  I tried Superior pho for the first time today, and I regret not going there sooner.  I admit the hidden hole-in-the-wall location made it less appealing so I always went elsewhere when in the mood for Vietnamese food.  Superior is getting elevated in my go-to restaurant list after my first experience.  I got a meal combo #10, which includes any large Pho (I got beef brisket), a delicious Bahn Mi Vietnamese sandwich (roast pork, pate, mayo, picked veggies, all on french bread), plus a drink.  I upgraded the drink to a taro bubble tea, which was not the best - the bobba/pearls were not tasty and chewy.  This combo should actually have a small pho rather than the large size because it is a LOT of food.  I also tried a little of the shredded marinated pork over broken rice with pickled veggies and it was very good.   For anyone new to Pho:  It comes with your choice of meats along with rice noodles and some lighter herbs in a savory broth.  A plate of bean sprouts, Asian basil, mint, pepper and lime is brought out on a plate.  You can eat the noodle soup plain, and I recommend you do that for a bite or two to get an initial taste to enjoy the broth flavor.  Many people will put in healthy handfuls from the plate of veggies, twist the lime juice, throw in a sliced jalenpeno pepper, and then squeeze some hoisin sauce (thick black sweet/tangy flavoring), and red Sriracha chilli sauce (a little goes a long way as the Sriracha can overpower everything).  Mix it up and enjoy.  It is a two handed affair with the soup spoon in one hand and chopsticks in the other.  Lots of napkins are at the table to wipe your mouth AND your brow from eating all the hot noodles.  Do not get Superior Pho mixed up with #1 Pho.  Both are on Superior Avenue.  Superior can be accessed by walking into the door facing Superior Ave., but then you have to walk all the way through the building, passing an accounting shop, an American restaurant, and a Korean restaurant.  An easier way is to drive around to the back of the building and park in the lot that has a \"Superior Pho\" sign above the back-door.  The food is worth the trouble.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"As the name implies (and not just because it's the name of the street) this is THE Superior Pho!   My family and I are regulars here and are always welcomed by the owner... it's been wonderful and heart-warming watching this small business grow and succeed over the years. Yet though the renovations, the expansion into the space next door (that hasn't been able to keep a business afloat until bought by this one), it's truly endearing to see how little there core menu has changed. And it is--in all it's unadorned, unpretentious simplicity--just delicious.   I don't know what makes the Pho so addictingly good--I honestly think they've managed to isolate a form of crack that has all the fun, but without the bugs-crawling-on-skin symptoms of withdrawal that comes with repeated use & crashing hard (just saying!). Still through all of it's success, the warm, brothy soup base of their Pho never fails to tickle your taste buds just right. And it's not MSG (I would know, since I get a horrible headache after ingesting some).   Oh, and the bahn mi? Wonderful. Crispy, flaky bread, the crunch of fresh vegetables, an aromatic spread of pate, and neatly fried, tasty sweet hefty chunks of tofu--I'm salivating just thinking about it.  Save your money & appetite, avoid other would be impostors--if you're in for some delicious Pho while in the Cleveland area, hit-up this place. It won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Stars: 4-  Pros: the cost and the quantity cannot be beat here. Yes, you have other Pho resturants within the area (#1 Pho, and 99 Pho), but this place is more well known and has much more variety than the other Pho places do. The quantity and price is tough to beat. The quality of the meat here is probably the best out of the 3 resturants I'd say. Also, they have a great Vietnamese Tea as well as buns.  Cons: 99 Pho has this place beat in terms of the broth, hands down, and probably noodles as well. My noodles were actually somewhat clumpy here (= cooked previously). However, this was not an issue at 99 Pho. The broth is very good! But, 99 Pho still is much better.   Bottom line:   I rated both 99 Pho and Superior Pho the same, but if im hungry or wanna grab some Pho with a group of guys, im going to Superior Pho.  BUT, if I wanted a more classy, better service, and cleaner restaurant, which serves smaller and neater portions that may be a bit more tasty, 99 Pho it is."}
{"text":"Who schedules serious business meetings at a place that serves probably one of the world's sloppiest foods to eat? This girl.   And you know what? It was worth it! (And I'm still craving more of this delicious pho!)   I went with the small bowl of brisket pho this time and I still could have left with food--and to think I was contemplating a spring roll.   You just can't really beat this place for the price. Sure the service can get a little weird (although it's never bothered me) and if you come in alone, you might have to sit at the same table as a stranger. So what? Why is that so bad? Just focus on the delicious steaming bowl of pho in front of you... or your bahn mi, and enjoy!"}
{"text":"The pho here is great.  Good broth, fresh sprouts, just good, solid pho.  Don't get the pho.  Get the 7C.  The Bahn Mi is one of the best sandwiches in Cleveland, and Cleveland has a lot of good sandwiches.  Or, do get the pho; you won't be disappointed.  People talk about all the great restaurants in Cleveland, but they somehow often forget to mention Superior Pho."}
{"text":"Been going here since I was in middle school, and back then, this place was relatively unknown. Then the renovation happened, and newspapers caught wind of the place, now it's easily one of Cleveland's gem restaurants. For some soul filling soup in a cold winter night, nothing beats Superior Pho's broth. Take it from me, someone who has been eating there regularly for over 10 years.... and I've never gotten sick of it. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I started working near downtown again this year and have found some really good lunch spots.  I discovered Superior Pho about a month ago.  I've had pho before but I'm more into the other Vietnamese dishes.  On my first visit I had the pho and a bahn mi sandwich.  It was delicious.  The pho had a nice broth with no overpowering flavors, a nice balance and not too much salt.  In a word, I thought it perfect.    The vegetables and herbs that came with the dish couldn't have been any fresher.  Crisp bean sprouts, fresh sliced jalapenos, a generous chunk off the top of a basil plant (looked like it was snapped off on the spot), and culantro, YES culantro.  For those of you that may not be familiar with it, culantro (Eryngium foetidum) is in the same family as cilantro but has a slightly different flavor.  It's a staple in the dishes of many countries and I grew up eating a lot of it.    A side of lime pieces topped the dish off and made it POP.    The bahn mi sandwich was delicious.  Crunchy bread, pate (but not too much pate) pork, carrots, jalapeno, cilantro..... OM NOM NOM.  Seriously good.  Staff is always friendly and keeps my water glass full.  What more could you ask for?  Fast service?  It doesn't get any faster.  I've not had a meal here yet that took more than 5 minutes to emerge from the kitchen.  That's right, 5 minutes.    Needless to say, I've been back at least ten times since my first visit.  I try to sample a different dish each time.    The cabbage salad with grilled marinated pork was super tasty with a nice garlic flavor without being overpowering.  The grilled pork is wicked flavorful with a nice smokiness.    The bun noodle bowls are awesome as well.  Great flavor, crunch, and tangy to boot.    Today I tried the Vietnamese curry.  I asked for it hot and it was dead on perfect.  Outstanding flavors of the broken jasmine rice, sauce, cucumbers, cilantro and meat made it perfect.  This may be my new favorite.  I've yet to receive bad service or a bad meal.  I've never seen any substandard veggies or herbs.  Honestly, they couldn't be fresher if there was a garden in the kitchen.  This place delivers CONSISTENTLY.  That says a lot for the management and owner.  They obviously take pride in their food.    The manger Chris is very friendly and answers my annoying questions about ingredients and recipes.  He asks everyone how their food was and is genuinely interested in feedback.    Superior Pho is my new favorite downtown lunch spot.  Yesterday Iron Chef Michael Symon was at the table next to me and I hear it's one of his favorites too.  You can't argue with Michael Symon.  He knows good food and frankly, I do too.  Try Superior Pho.  It's a little slice of heaven.  Chris"}
{"text":"The best pho I've had. The banh mih is impeccable, and the pho is delicious. The service is as fast as Jimmy John's is supposed to be, and the portions are the size of my head. Well worth your money."}
{"text":"Another 5-Star zone within 2 minutes of where I work. I don't give out a lot of 5 star reviews, but while I'm reviewing my favorite work week lunch spots, I guess I'll knock this one out too. I'm going to pan Saigon Grille in a minute here to even things out a bit.  Superior Pho is my go to lunch spot, usually on Tuesdays. Another place you can walk in to, sit down, order, eat, and pay in less than 30 minutes. You can also hang out if you'd like and take your time. Either way the food comes out fast and hot, every time. I have never had to wait long. The staff is very friendly, they get you in and out and are never rude.  The atmosphere is very pleasant, especially in the midst of the downtown Cleveland shuffle. You can sit alone at a small table or sit at a big one, and share with somebody else you may not know. Everybody is pretty friendly and seem to consist of families from Cleveland's very small Chinatown contingent and/or the 9-5 Cleveland downtown workforce.  Prices are MORE than reasonable considering the quality and care put into the food. User Amber V. below claims she's \"Road Trippin'\", but she's just straight trippin'!   I always get the bowl of traditional Pho. The #1. The bowl of gold. Paradise in soup form. Instant Joy via heaping rice noodle serving. The Main Event. This is how you know a place like this is perfect. The first item on the menu, and one of the best bowls of soup in the world if not the absolute greatest. This Pho is one thing in my life that makes me happy no matter what, every single time I eat it.  The Pho is served in a massive bowl with plentiful amounts of rice noodles which are light and cooked to perfection in their absolutely flawless golden broth. The beef is shaved thin and is very flavorful. There is a perfect balance between all the ingredients and they all compliment each other in a wonderful and special way.  I always put a little bit of their plum sauce in the bowl after I mix in my lime and bean sprouts. It's a good mix and it's up to you to add as much as you desire.   I will say it one more time, best bowl of Pho on Earth! I wouldn't change a single thing about it. Definite top 3 \"last meal\" contender."}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try this place after hearing that they serve the best pho in cleveland.  It was difficult finding the entrance to this place. We parked on the side street and ended up walking into a different restaurant thinking it was superior pho. Entrance is actually in the back of the building.  I got the #1 meal which came with 1 summer or spring roll, a small pho of your choice and a soft drink ($11.95). The spring roll I had was a good healthy size and came with peanut sauce. I ordered the #3 pho (eye round and brisket) and it tasted delicious! It was the perfect meal during a cold day outside.  I've tried other pho places around cleveland and I will say that flavor wise, it was pretty much on par with the others. However in terms of value, superior pho takes the cake."}
{"text":"We come here about once a week and it's good food in a friendly atmosphere. Kids get a little bag of fruit snacks. They all know us by now and it feels like part of an extended family. I love tennis and the TV is always on the Tennis Channel so that's a bonus. It's not the best Pho I've ever had, but it's worth coming back for as \"an old standby.\" It's easy to get to and easy to park behind in an urban area--and that's a safe bet for any suburbanites willing to make the trip. The Chicken Fried rice (C3?) is very addicting. The Bah Mi is good, but again, not the best out there. The service is great. Very friendly, correct and fast. Yes, you'll get off-days if it's peak time, but that's to be expected. I wish they were open past 8pm, but I understand that people have families. The vermicelli bowls are the best in town! They don't have much competition in Asiatown. The Saigon Grille was a good competitor, but they are no longer in business."}
{"text":"Yesss! We love Superior Pho- as close to authentic as you can get around these parts. I'm always a big fan of the 2 or 3 pho bowls. Tonight, I tried the chicken pho for the first time and it was so delicious. Ask for a side of chili paste with whatever you order- it's so good. The hot jasmine tea is another one of my favorites here."}
{"text":"Superior Pho has probable the best Pho in the Cleveland area. Not the best I ever had but very good for Cleveland. Sorry I comparing it to places in Vietnam, Southern California, and Houston. You can smell the aroma of this delicious Pho before it reaches the table. The broth is very tasty and aromatic, but sometimes a little skimpy on the meat, but still a bargain. The broth of this traditional Vietnamese staple is truly addictive. The soup comes in two different sizes, I opted for the large #12, which was full of different cuts of beef. Serve with a side plate of the traditional garnishes, fresh bean sprouts, sliced jalapenos, lime or lemon wedges, and Thai basil or saw leaf. The soup is very filling and delicious for under eight dollars. I also like the light and flavorful summer rolls and Banh Mi sandwich, which is served on a warm French roll with a crackly crunchy crust, stuffed with thin slices of pate, roasted pork and topped with pickled daikon and carrots, cilantro, cucumber and sliced jalapeno. There are other traditional Vietnamese dishes on the menu, but I don't think I will ever be able to go there without having a big bowl of Pho. So if you're looking for good bowl of Pho give it a try. The entrance and parking is easier through the back of the building."}
{"text":"An Authentic Vietnamese Restaurant. I thought it was absolutely wonderful.  :D   We started off with a Shrimp summer roll each and then both ordered the number -12:     Ph dc biêt      (noodle soup with all previously listed meats, except meat balls)"}
{"text":"Best phó in Cleveland. I ordered the large phó and could have easily killed two.   For the non-Clevelander...  Bubble = Boba = Tapioca balls."}
{"text":"Maybe I am comparing this place to California but the food here is really not good. I got the Bun bo hue and there was just a few slices of beef shank. The soup base is bland. Too much noodle which is not edible. Don't expect anything authentic. It takes forever to pay the bill at the cashier. Sorely disappointing"}
{"text":"Stopped for a light dinner on a Sunday afternoon and had good service from some nice young people. Regretted not ordering the phó and summer rolls. The bahn mi were different than I've had before but not bad. Small, with a soft warm bun, they had less fresh cilantro and pickles than I'm used to. Tasty but small. The spring roll was meaty and didn't come with fresh lettuce and cilantro to wrap it. Not worth the $2.50 each."}
{"text":"It's about time I reviewed my absolute favorite restaurant in the CLE!  This place has been a staple in my diet for over ten years. I took my future wife out on dates here. And now I bring our 2 boys here to eat. (They love noodles) I cannot express how much this place means to me. If I were stuck eating only one food for the rest of my life. It would be Pho from Superior pho. And I would be the happiest man in the world!!!!!!!!! Best Bahn Mi too. It just gets better and better."}
{"text":"Housed in a nondescript building with multitudes of Asian establishments in a forlorn neighborhood of Cleveland, Superior Pho was a true delight and an amazing find! Make sure you get to the right restaurant though; enter the door saying 3030 and walk all the way to the end.   Pho Tai Chin was the one I tried and it's great!"}
{"text":"The pho is decent, but more expensive than other pho places in Cleveland. The Banh Mi is overpriced and made of cheap ingredients like cheap bread, butter and lunchmeat with no actual grilled meat like some other restaurants. Also, the dishes and eating utensils smell strongly of bleach. Above average price for below average food and sanitation."}
{"text":"i love this place. i consider myself pretty well versed in vietnamese cuisine for a number of reasons and this place does it right. the pho broth is really flavorful which is key - and come to think of it, i've never had a bad dish here. it's well priced food - relatively healthy, fresh and delicious. and that's hard to beat..."}
{"text":"I got lost trying to find this place, but ohhh once I was inside tasting the delicious pho everything was made better! It was just simple food made well, and a pretty big bowl of food at a decent price. I have been dreaming about going back ever since my first visit!"}
{"text":"It really is JUST alright ...  but if you're comparing it to pho in cleveland alone, i GUESS i can understand why someone would love it....  but then again.... the only place to compare it to is #1 Pho."}
{"text":"My favorite place to go for a quick, full-service meal.  Their Pho is the best in Cleveland, and the service is quick -- you can be in an out of this place in less than 30 minutes.  A large bowl of Pho is enough to fill the stomach of just about anyone I know, so prepare to leave quite full.  Also, be forewarned, the community bathrooms may be the worst in Cleveland and the ambiance is rather drab, so its not the best place for a romantic dinner.  My favorites: Spring Roll, Pho #2 (any pho, really), Bánh mì."}
{"text":"The pho was delicious and reasonably priced, with quality cuts of meat and a big side plate of fresh basil and bean sprouts. The service couldn't have been any better, extremely fast and welcoming."}
{"text":"When we moved from Cleveland last summer, one of things I knew I was going to miss most was the food at Superior Pho.  As a Southern California native, finding authentic and DELICIOUS Asian cuisine in Northeast Ohio was certainly a challenge!    My favorite thing to order (besides their amazing selection of pho) is the Vietnamese sandwich with a side of shredded cabbage and chicken salad.  At the end of the meal, I always walked out of there with a boba in hand.  There's always room for bubble tea!  Superior Pho is definitely a \"hole-in-the-wall\" worth raving about!  Service is fast and food is FRESH.  I have never had a bad meal here.   This is one of Cleveland's best kept secrets but I know word is getting out because of positive reviews written here on Yelp.    I miss Superior Pho!"}
{"text":"there is parking in back and no signage from street view but you can walk through the restaurant in front to reach the enterance. It was perfect pho. Just like Los Angeles spots. only nthing that kind of wierded me out was the design on the inside of the bowl my soup was in, the paint was half chipped off so I imagine with every use, someone is eating  little paint."}
{"text":"With a name like Superior Pho, there is a lot of pressure to well be \"Superior\". I'm a huge fan of viet food in general and especially pho. Coming from Cincinnati, there aren't too many options so anytime I see a viet restaurant my eyes light up!  I've been here once before and this place really hit the spot on a cold winter day. What could be better than hot pho right. After having a bunch of pho from all around the country, I have to say the pho here was just okay. It was a nice portion but I felt it was lacking something. The banh mi was just okay as well, I'm not sure if it was the one I got but it felt like it wasn't as full as it should've been. The bun bo hue we ordered too wasn't terrible but it was on the garlicky side so it's all a matter of opinion and taste.    Superior Pho wasn't the best I ever had but I'll have to check it out again and maybe give it another chance."}
{"text":"After seeing all the positive reviews on yelp I just HAD to try this place during my stay in Cleveland. After being led to a table by a young man (who didn't say 1 word) I ordered a couple of large bowls of pho with my fiancee. In Ohio standards, there was a decent amount of meat in the soup but it was rather tasteless. The broth was meh, and the utensils were really dirty. I ended up wiping down all the chopsticks and spoons before actually using them. We were only checked up on one time and we sat there waiting for our check until we flagged down our \"server\" who told us we had to pay up front. Hmm.. coulda told us before we finished our food and waited 15 minutes? When asked by the boy who rung us up how our food was, my fiance had an enthusiastic \"great!\" while i said, \"fine.\" I guess the boy was used to hearing a lot of \"god this place is so good\" among all the local midwesterners because he asked if anything was wrong with the food.   Mediocre at best, but good for Cleveland."}
{"text":"The pho was excellent, I had the regular one with round steak. Everything was as I wanted, fresh veggies, good cut of steak, and very flavorful broth. I would describe the broth as well rounded, the flavor profile didn't lean one way or another. Overall this is great quality pho in downtown Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Remember to take my review with a grain of salt because I mostly eat pho in Philadelphia or DC (majority of Vietnamese population on the east coast). I don't even like some NY pho restaurants. I am a little spoiled.... (maybe snobby too). Sorry!  I was excited to find such a highly rated Vietnamese restaurant in Cleveland, but I was immediately very disappointed. This was severely mediocre pho and Vietnamese food. The main star of pho is the broth, and it wasn't very flavorful. I also ordered the pork and broken rice dish which was subpar. I definitely do not want to take away from how much everyone else loves it. It definitely wasn't horrible or inedible; however, I have definitely experienced better.  In addition, it was pretty confusing locating the restaurant. It's not a separate building from the Korean restaurant. If you park in the back and walk in the building you set on googlemaps, you'll see the restaurant to your right. Other restaurants are in the building too. Don't get it mixed up!"}
{"text":"Superior Pho!  This place is fantastic.  Comfort food at it's best.  Seriously, if I'm feeling under the weather or hungover, a bowl of pho and a coconut bubble tea is the cure without fail.  We probably eat here more than any other restaurant in Cleveland.   We have tried other Pho restaurants far and wide, but we always end up back at Superior Pho.  We even tried Number One Pho in the neighborhood, but Superior Pho still lives up to their name.  No other pho compares, this place is truly superior."}
{"text":"This was a bit pho-ed up. We ordered our food and it took quite a while to get our food. When we did receive our food (in which the food was placed at the end of the table and a blank stare accompanied it as they didn't know who's food was who's), they didn't give us any utensils. We had to ask twice to get them. Luckily, the wait staff was very nice and didn't seem upset that we brought a large group. The food tasted decent. It didn't taste good enough to be $9 though. I'd much prefer to buy $9 worth of peanut butter, because at least it'd fill me up."}
{"text":"how's this for original; this is superior pho, really good! the broth is excellent, rare beef (great slices and cut). the atmosphere isn't much to talk about (Number one pho has better setting but this is overall better pho/soups). Can't wait to return, the hours BLOW; closed by 7, 8 pm."}
{"text":"Having lived in San Francisco and experienced authentic Vietnamese cuisine in several family run restaurants there, the popular Superior Pho is not the most authentic Vietnamese restaurant in NE Ohio.  Their Pho is just OK - generous portions but more noodles than I prefer and a bit too salty. Their summer rolls were below average - being a bit mushy to the touch, and were not freshly prepared, but served chilled (not room temp), as if they were sitting in the refrig already premade. And their peanut sauce is inconsistent - sometimes thick and tasty, other times runny and too spicy. Their Vietnamese sandwich - Banh Mi - seemed a bit small in size and lacking in meat quantity, though the bread was a nice crusty texture. The staff is friendly, but the restaurant is often not that clean with sticky and poorly wiped table surfaces, and obvious food particles on the floor/under table and chairs. Prices are average.  I have been coming here for several years now, and the quality has definitely declined. It is now very popular and I think that quality control has suffered a lot. Luckily, for those seeking authentic, quality, fresh Vietnamese cuisine, try the new PHO HA NAM located in the Asian Town Center just a few blocks away on Superior. This family run restaurant is now the most authentic and quality focused Vietnamese restaurant in NE Ohio. Check it out, you won't be disappointed!     Share"}
{"text":"The food was okay.  I feel like a lot of vegetables and things lacking on the menu, but it's probably because there isn't a lot of people who use/order those things.  Overall, the pho itself wasn't too bad."}
{"text":"My husband and I were taken here by a friend and we got the #2 beef pho. It was incredible! The broth was great and the beef was tender, we will definitely go back soon!!"}
{"text":"So good, as always. I stopped by to get takeout for my first time yesterday and it was great. While I waited for my pho-to-go, they brought me hot tea to enjoy at a table which was sweet. The pho as takeout was as good as always- enormous, with the brisket, the noodles, the bean sprouts, mint leaves, lime wedge, and sauce all packed up separately so it stayed fresh. Solid work superior pho, you've made me warm and happy once again."}
{"text":"Checked this place out for dinner tonight and it didn't disappoint. I believe this may be one of the most authentic Vietnam food places in Cleveland. I ordered the Meal 8 ~ $12.95  / Spring roll and Bun bò Hue Soup.  My spring roll came out very quickly with a side of dipping sauce. Not sure what the meat inside the spring roll was but it was really good. Next the Bun bo Hue Soup . It had a small hint of spice and the rest was all flavor. The broth was excellent and the beef meet was pretty good as well."}
{"text":"I pretty much crave this place once a week at least. I love noodles soup and I've already tried 3 different Vietnamese stores in Cleveland and find Superior Pho to be the best of all. I usually get their summer rolls along with a Pho w/ meatballs soup. I really like this place and is cheap for its quantity. In addition, their service is really good and fast!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong one of the best around. Have never had a bad meal. Went on a Wednesday afternoon for lunch got in and out. love P2 so fresh and the spring roles are Amazing love the rice wrap spring roles the best but like the fried also had to order both."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend of mine. I was in line and  the dude that was seating people started talking with someone Asians.  I was in line before these people and he walked by myself and my blond friend then proceeded to seat them.  I was like OK, maybe just a misunderstanding.  Then the guy does it again and the other Asian he was going to seat said\" they were here 1st\" he said this multiple times.  The guy still tried to seat them and the gentleman said \" no they were here 1st\"  I looked at my blond friend and said,\"are you fcuking kidding me\". She said you know they sat other people before us also. I advised that maybe it was a mistake the 1st time so I was waiting to see if they do it again.  I joked and suggested our meal was going to be free one way or another!     I finally looked at the dude and said I have been standing here before the other table you just sat, if you can not give me a table then I can leave if you want.  Finally the D-bag sat us.  I have seen this happen in other Asian places but not in really long time, The dimsum carts will show some Asian bias as well : ) and I am not being fcuking paranoid. When I go to Dim Sum with my buddy whom is a Chinese restaurant owner the service is the Bomb and he orders way too much shit!  We started with spring rolls and summer rolls.  The spring rolls were great, just mount them on lettuce, dip and crunch. Very nice. They were really hot so I know they were fresh.  The summer rolls were a bit borring. They had mint.  There was only 1.5 shimp per roll. The peanut sauce had some chilli pepper paste on the bottom it was tasty but I have neve seen that before.  I suppose if you did not like spicy it would be a not so nice suprise. I have yet to try an Asian place that has been too spicy. But I am not your averge gringo in that deparment.   We ordered the #3 which is Beef Noodle Pho with rare eye-o-round and briskett.  It was good but the broth lacked a little bit of ommmph.  After adding lime, basil, sirracha, sprouts, fish sauce and jalapenos, I was ready to get my soup on. It was good!  Everything was super fresh.  But in all honesty the soup was really no better than what I have eaten at some other places. The food coupled with the Asian seating Nazi I can only give it 3 stars."}
{"text":"The best Viet spot in Cleveland.  I've tried all of them and this one wins hands down. The funny thing is, I am not even that big on pho... yet I really like the pho here.  It really is \"superior\". I'm usually turned off by the overwhelming flavors that make up the broth in pho, but theirs is mild enough for me while still being very tasty.   Don't let the restaurant's name deter you from trying other menu items. A one trick pony this is not. Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio, a vermicelli bowl with veggies, grilled pork, and chopped up egg rolls, is by far my favorite Viet dish, and I think they reign \"superior\" over all other Cleveland Viet restaurants in this department as well. They serve up a mean Banh Mi as well. The bread has a perfect textural combination of crunchy/chewy/soft, and the ingredients blend together perfectly, no one flavor dominating the other, which happens a lot with banh mi from other places. It is mouthwatering just talking about it. I swing by just to stock up on 5 or 6 sandwiches sometimes.  Portions are huge, prices are very reasonable, and staff is excellent.   If you want reliable, good Viet food in Cleveland, go here. Whenever my friends and I are craving Viet, the discussion usually starts and ends with the words \"Superior Pho.\""}
{"text":"I'm pretty partial to good noodle dishes and I enjoy revisiting Superior Pho again and again. The broths are so clean and enhance the other ingredients that come added to the bowl from the kitchen. Most of the bowls are graced with a wonderful side of fresh vegetables like jalapenos, bean sprouts and cilantro. Adding these to the bowl only further enhances the beautiful quality of the food here.   This place is perfect comfort food for cold and rainy or snowy days."}
{"text":"It seems that all the people I know who have had pho in Cleveland unanimously agree that Superior Pho is the place to get it.  The bowls are large, the broth is tasty, the meat is cooked well, and it is cheap.  I especially like getting their special with a large pho, a vietnamese sandwich, and a drink.  The service is fast, which makes pho to be an excellent quick meal for a cold day.  And clearly many of my acquaintances agree, as I often run into (or they run into each other!) when getting pho.  If you want pho in Cleveland, Superior pho is the place to be."}
{"text":"Best pho in town! (Actually I wouldn't know because this is the ONLY pho place I will go to in Cleveland.) Comparable to my favorite pho places on Argyle in Chicago. Very inexpensive, too!"}
{"text":"I'm from Cincinnati, and I've got my favorite place for Vietnamese food there.  But, more often than I'd like, I go to another city - almost always where there is a much larger Viet population - and find better fare.  I chose Superior Pho from my Yelp app in the car on the way into Cleveland.  I was heading to a meeting just a few blocks away, and I actually thought this was taking me to Number One Pho, which I had been to before.  #1 was good, but Superior Pho was better.  I had a bun salad with pork and the flavor of the marinated meat, the nuoc cham, and other ingredients was extremely good.  I also ordered one of the shrimp and pork cold wraps and it was tasty as well.  I'll definitely be back when I make the trip back up, and I look forward to trying more of the menu's options."}
{"text":"Every time I come here, I salivate at the thought of the Pho I am going wolf done.  I always get the number 12, which has all the type of meat your stomach can probably handle.  The broth here is not too salty and has just the right amount of flavor.  I not only get leftovers, but I use the broth for other noodles that I make myself the next day.  This is a treat you don't want to deprive yourself of.  The only downside of this place is it is a bit harder to find since it is off the beaten path, but hey the best things are the ones we work for right?  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Oh, beautiful, savory, delicious pho. Tried to separate pho restaurants during my visit. Both were great, but this was the more mouth-watering of the two. If you don't need fancy accommodations, just great pho, this is your place."}
{"text":"I love love love love this place.  I go by myself sometimes.   It's that kind of place.  Hidden away from everything, it's just a simple no frills type of place.  They have specials where you can get a bowl of pho, a sandwich and a can of pop for about 8 bucks.  A bowl of pho (even the small is big) is only about 5-6 bucks.  It's delicious.   The iced coffee is by far better than anything you'll get at starbucks or any coffee joint.  The banh mi (Vietnamese sandwich) comes on a killer french roll with all the good stuff inside (pate, head cheese, hot peppers, pickled veggies... really good) Cleveland has a very limited number of good Vietnemese places but, in my opinion, this one is the best in the area."}
{"text":"Awesome. If I didn't know better I would think I was in the heart of an Asian culture center of something. 5 stars for being on par with Cali and DFW. woot!"}
{"text":"I tried Minh Anh a couple weeks ago and I must say, I definitely prefer Superior Pho. Fast service (I was there right at 11am), great tasting Pho, I got the Pho Ga (chicken), and a KILLER Vietnamese iced coffee with condensed milk. If you're in the area I would definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"This is truly superior pho. One of the best restaurants in Asia Town and a definite must eat while in Cleveland."}
{"text":"No trip to Cleveland would be complete without stopping in for a bowl of superior pho. The service is outstanding but the food is what you come here for, it is hands down delicious and the BEST pho I have had even better than in Northern California. Get a meal 3, small pork sale (delicious) an order of spring or summer rolls (get the spring they are crispy), a small pho of your choice (get the number 3 pho it's a combo of 1 and 2 which is round steak and beef flank), and a drink. It's the best value and you get to try most of the menu. I almost feel bad writing this review because this used to be the best kept secret in Cleveland but the word has gotten out and it can get a bit busy because of that."}
{"text":"Been craving pho for about a week and this definitely satisfied that craving  I have tried a couple of pho spots in the city and this is always my go-to. No frills, cheap and so good!"}
{"text":"Great food....full of flavor. I would highly recommend the rice noodles with pork, shrimp and spring roll. The service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"I can't say that I am an expert on Japanese Korean cuisine. But I am an expert on knowing what foods I like, and let me tell you, I liked this food. I got the shredded pork bun (vermicelli) and summer rolls with shredded pork and it hit the spot. The only place I can compare it with is Saigon, and I would give Saigon just a bit of the edge but only because I liked the pork roll in my bun better than the shredded meat I got at Superior Pho. But that's about it. Prices were reasonable. I can't comment on the restaurant because we ordered takeout and I never went in. But overall, food was great and I'll definitely be coming back again to try something new!"}
{"text":"This place is a nope.  A big NOPE.    The service was meh. Got a bubble tea, and it tasted like burnt plastic.        The food was good however.    When checking out I asked the waiter to take it off the ticket since I didn't drink it which you could clearly tell.     He argued with me about he can't take it off because there is nothing wrong with it.  I said there is something wrong with it it taste like burnt plastic.    So they would not remove it from the ticket.     The foods decent the prices are a little high but the service kills it all."}
{"text":"Quality, no-frills Pho, fast service - this is my noodle shop of choice in Cleveland. Reasonable prices, too. Would be 5 stars if the broth had a bit more depth."}
{"text":"Superior Pho is a good option if you are craving pho in Cleveland, and is definitely a good value given the portions you get for the prices. If you are in the mood for a noodle soup dish, my friends and I always order the bun bo hue, which has a flavorful broth of aromatic spices. Their bahn mi is also delicious if you are in the mood for a sandwich, and the shrimp cabbage salad is a tasty appetizer. The service is always very fast, so you won't be waiting long for your meal!"}
{"text":"Despite all the rave reviews...My visiting Vietnamese guests did not seem to think Superior Pho was all that superior.  I think their food tastes ok, but for the reputation they have, I was dissappointed in the fact my Vietnamese comrades did not enjoy the cuisine."}
{"text":"The S.O. and I were craving for some pho after a long day and noticed the raving reviews for Superior Pho.  I'm no pho connoisseur, but I've definitely had better. I wasn't a big fan of the broth. However, I do like how they have combos. I've never been to a pho place that have combos on the menu. Wo both got the regular pho with a spring roll and a drink. Service was good and fast. I would have liked the broth to have more oomph to it."}
{"text":"Since discovering Vietnamese food a few years back I have tried many places here locally and Superior Pho is by far my favorite.  I have tried quite a bit of their menu and haven't been disappointed yet.    They have so many good things, that often times I will get a 4C (chicken fried rice) and a 2A (pork spring rolls) to eat while I am there, and then get a Pho to take home (my favorites are Ga (chicken) or  Chin (well done brisket)).  Their fried rice is not greasy like many fried rice dishes tend to be and is loaded with chicken.  It has such good flavor I have inquired as to what type of rice it is (jasmine).  All of the Pho broth is super flavorful, I like to add sprouts, lime, hoisin and some siracha to mine which just makes it that much better.    I highly recommend this place, and have even gotten my Mom addicted to the yumminess that is Superior Pho.  Don't miss out!!"}
{"text":"So much better than #1 pho...it just doesn't look great inside...definitely hole in the wall pho, but so good!  The taste of the food is probably the best you can get in Cleveland, so don't judge a book by it's cover.  It tastes great, doesn't cost much, and has good service...what more can you ask for in a pho restaurant?  Definitely top notch for midwest offerings."}
{"text":"Best Pho ever in my life . . . . well no, that was in San Gabriel, California. Best Bahn Mi I ever had!?  Umm, no that was at Lee's Sandwiches in California. Best darn Vietnamese food in Ohio?!?! I think it might be*!!   But seriously - this is good stuff.  I'm a bit boring when it comes to ordering food out. I like to think of it as consistent: ordering the same things in order to accurately compare multiple establishments, and food items. So, every time I go to a Vietnamese (Pho) restaurant, I get the crispy spring rolls and pho tai. This time when we went, being pregnant in my second \"eat everything in sight\" trimester, I ordered the number 10 combo: large pho tai, bahn mi, and added crispy spring rolls. Meanwhile my husband ordered a small pho ga, knowing that he would get a bit of my left-overs.   The crispy spring rolls are a thing of beauty - and these hold up too any I've had in California. The dipping \"sauce\" could maybe use a bit more vinegar, but still very flavorful. The bahn mi was close to perfect, as a bahn mi should be. The bread was a wonderful french bread, super crusty and lusciously chewy at the same time. The pork was a great balance of meat to fat, and sliced so thin the fat was easy to bite through and melted in your mouth. The other toppings on the sandwich were equally delicious. I did have to take off the larger slices of chile peppers, but this is because I am a bit of a wimp with chile spice.  The pho is where I lost one star. The steak was great - very tender and sliced thin so it cooked easily in the broth. Some of the better steak pieces I've had in a pho. The noodles were plentiful, even or maybe I should say especially in the large portion. The bean sprouts, lime, chile slices, and Thai basil served on the side were all fresh (even in January). The only small little tiny complaint was in the broth. It just wasn't best ever for me. It maybe tasted a little too much of the meat and not enough of the spices and such. It was still good enough to gobble down!   Warning! The parking lot in the winter is more of an ice skating rink, than a parking lot. Use Caution!!  *Note - I have not yet had any other Vietnamese food in Ohio."}
{"text":"So delicious!  Enjoyed the pho so much in this unassuming little gem. Delicious bubble tea as well!"}
{"text":"I was in the area for business and really wanted some pho, I searched here on Yelp to see which was the most praised in the area. I'm from the Atlanta area so I had great expectations with Vietnamese cuisines since there's so many good restaurants in metro Atlanta. I ordered the Spring Rolls which were kind of mushy and the meat did not seem fresh, nothing like I had before!  Also, the pho didn't have much taste but was acceptable. The atmosphere was quite nice but the service did not seem on par. Overall an adequate experience at this establishment."}
{"text":"This is the go-to spot for pho in Cleve for me. I've tried the others in the chinatown area, and they just are not good period. The broth is delicious and piping hot when they bring it to you, as it should be. Other places I shall not name give it to you luke-warm. Oh, and they lack flavor.   I like to eat my pho as it is, without adding much other sauce. I like to enjoy it pure, because it took time to infuse it with all the beefy, aromatic flavor. Not too salty, not bland...just right.   I've tried the banh mi here and it's different from what I'm used to, but good.   They are also very nice and efficient with service here. So if you go during the lunch hour, no worries. They will take care of you as fast as they can."}
{"text":"ugh, why does this place have a 4.5?!?! I had a basic beef Pho, small bowl - the broth was cardboard nasty. Didn't even taste right. I had to ADD hoisin, sriracha and FISH SAUCE to make the flavor more full and savory.   Worst off, there was an obnoxious white girl across from me who started talking about the Zimmerman trial and how she thought race was not an issue to her friend. She was such an annoying bitch.  http://www.timwise.org/2013/07/no-innocence-left-to-kill-racism-injustice-and-explaining-america-to-my-daughter/"}
{"text":"This has got to be one of the best, if not the absolute best pho spots in all of Cleveland. I've been here multiple times and have never been disappointed. Not easy to find from the street, but rightfully tucked away. The interior has a wall of all of their accolades, and you know your in the right spot.   It's always a win when we can agree on a restaurant since there are many different options on the menu. I've always dined in, but I always love the idea of take out. Aside from the amazing pho options they have one of the best Bánh mí I've ever tried.   I would highly recommend this spot. There's nothing better during the cold winter in Cleveland than some hot yummy pho."}
{"text":"Alright, it's about time I reviewed this place.  I'm Vietnamese from San Jose, CA.  Upon moving to Cleveland, I was really dreading not having legit asian food and then I found out about this place.  I would definitely say this is the best Pho in Cleveland and at a great price.  I even took my mom here and she said it was pretty good!  Pho #1 is also alright, but you can get it just as good at Superior for a few bucks less.  The \"summer rolls\" are alright, but I don't recommend their other soups.  I tried their Bun Bo Hue and it tasted like they used the same Pho broth in it (a definite no-no).   Anyways, definitely recommend this place for Pho--perfect for a cold day or a hangover cure.  It's also super quick. Like true asian style, they ask you within minutes of you sitting down if you're ready to order. Gogogo! Also, for coffee lovers, try the Vietnamese iced coffee, it's sweet and strong."}
{"text":"Hands down best PHO in Cleveland. Don't mind the other low reviews about the place. They only complain because it doesn't look like a 5 star restaurant...the best places to eat are always small average looking places. It doesn't have to look like a a resort to taste amazing. Superior Pho has excellent choices of food especially the PHO and their summer rolls are delicious. The place is always packed with people and is way better than Number One PHO that is across the street."}
{"text":"Imagine if there was a restaurant named \"Better Beef Burritos.\"  In this hypothetical bodega, they offer a somewhat limited menu featuring the following:  Ground beef burrito Shredded beef burrito Steak burrito Lengua burrito  They also have a few other dishes with comparable taste profiles and similar ingredients, including quesadillas, tacos, a burrito bowl, and a burrito salad.    Now imagine trying one of their burritos, only to find yourself comparing that burrito to every other burrito you have ever eaten.  Through this process you determine that the burrito bought at Better Beef Burritos is superior to all the other burritos you have had.     That's kind of how this is.  This place is a one-trick pony, but it's a pretty good trick - you'll probably be disappointed at the next dog and pony show, and want to go back to Superior Pho.  In fact, I would say this place is Pho-Nominal!   (That's a pun that works on multiple levels - I counted at least four)"}
{"text":"I don't understand why people love it that much!   THEIR SERVICE IS TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!  We just got our menu, and after literally 10 second, a girl with no expression on her face came to ask us if we are ready to order. We hadn't even OPEN the menu!! The ordering is normal, but non of the server we met yesterday had smiles on their faces!   After a while, they just gave the food to you, and that's it! They never stop by to check how you're doing. We need to pay in the front desk, and after the payment, I give the tips directly to the person at the front desk, he just TOOK IT and with not even a smile, a friendly eye-contact, and i don't even remember if he said thank you or not.  The food is just normal pho, and its even not as good as the Conventry Pho. Not to mention the service at Conventry Pho is ALWAYS so welcoming and homie. Me and my friends went here twice, and we will never step in again!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Pho and have unsuccessfully searched many restaurants in the area in the hope of finding one that tickles my taste buds. When I arrived at Superior Pho, I knew immediately that the search had ended.  Their broth is delicious. You can tell they've taken the necessary time to simmer and let flavors from quality ingredients seep in. They give a healthy serving of side ingredients like jalapenos, sprouts, limes, etc to develop even deeper flavor as you slurp away at the broth. All this flavor at very reasonable prices. Needless to say, I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"So visiting Ohio I saw on Yelp the good reviews this place had.  As a Vietnamese individual from California (who grew up eating some of the best pho ever) and currently living in NY (home of some quite disappointing pho fare) I had to stop here to give this place a go.  Some of the best pho people have ever eaten, huh?  Let's see.  First off, this place is not directly on Superior Street.  It's in some sort of shady mall location in the back.  Don't be misled and go to that Pho #1 location by accident unless you intended to go to Pho #1.  I ordered a #10 which got me 1 large bowl of pho (I ordered the Dac Biet which is the Special) and a Vietnamese Banh Mi (Sandwich) and a drink (wished they gave the option of Vietnamese iced coffee as a drink which they don't).  Ok so the pho.  Simply put the meat used were great.  Some of the best beef I've had in awhile in a pho dish.  And they probably used a professional slicing machine for the tripe.  Some of the thinnest slicest of tripe I've ever encountered.  Thumbs up. The broth, however, was lacking.  While not watery, I didn't feel it was flavorful enough.  Just my opinion.  My comrades felt there was too much of a ginger taste with the broth.  Also, there were not tendon in my pho.  What's up with that?  I did order a Dac Biet after all.  On to the sandwich.  Sorry, it's not authentic.  I am one of the folks who's a big believer in the actual bread being of equal importance as what's inside it.  While the filing was good enough the bread used...I'm not sure what that was. My friend and I bought ordered the #10 so I'm sure they used the same loaf of bread for each of us and just ripped it in half for each.  It looked like an italian bread ripped in half.  Disappointment.  I wished I could give at least a 3.5 star for this place because hey Cleveland you beat New York with your pho."}
{"text":"I come here once a week and has never been disappointed. Best pho and bubble tea!"}
{"text":"Plane just touched down in Cleveland and was sooooo dying to get Pho from here for the first time. Totally disappointed:(! Soup broth was ehhhh, nothing outstanding. Very little meat given (ordered Pho dac biet with all of the meats except meatballs, only received like two meats!) and was basically one serving for $9+. Nothing to rave about, definitely have had so much better, won't be back!"}
{"text":"Ordered Pho with beef brisket in it and an appetizer of spring rolls.   Spring rolls were crispy and hot, without a lot of residual grease. Very enjoyable.  Pho was excellent.   So good in fact, I accidentally rubbed jalapeno juice in my eye that was on my fingers. Felt like my eyeball was melting. Did that stop me? No. Ate with my eyes totally closed. Did I look odd eating pho in the middle of a crowded restaurant whilst crying? Who cares.  I will certainly be back (maybe with goggles on)."}
{"text":"First place on my tour of Cleveland, thanks to my buddy Patrick.  This was my first Pho experience, and it was-as the three-star rating might suggest- A-OK.  All of us got a combo meal, which included a Vietnamese sandwich, and all but one of us got the Pho.  I chose the flank steak.  It had an interesting appearance, looked and tasted a little bit stringy.  Everything else about the soup was ok, and I like that they include a bunch of stuff on the side that you can add the way you like, such as sweet basil, bean sprouts, and some extra hot jalapeños.  Add in some sriracha hot sauce, and the soup was the perfect amount of sweet and spicy.  The jasmine hot tea was a good choice to complement the meal.  And for the amount of money ($10 or so), you get a ton of food.  Cons:  If you're white or inexperienced in Pho like myself, there's not a whole lot of explanation of the different kinds of food.  Also, there's an extra charge for to-go containers.  Not a huge deal, as the containers are pretty heavy-duty, but it's not something you see everyday.  Overall, it was a good meal with good friends.  If I make it back to Cleve, it's on the list!"}
{"text":"This is hands-down the best Vietnamese food in Cleveland. The food is fantastic and plentiful and the service is fast. They also meet my criteria for spicy food: it's not spicy unless I'm sweating profusely and have tears in my eyes. Skip a meal if you must and order the Pho and Bahn Mi combo (#10)."}
{"text":"Best Pho in Northeast Ohio. Flavorful broth, great blend of flavors and hearty portions. Great prices. Another plus was Friendly staff. If you want Pho, go here. Great for dine in or carry out."}
{"text":"The best place for pho in CLE hands down! My Vietnamese friends agree that Superior Pho has the most authentic and tasty pho around, so it must be true! I come here often when I'm craving some good noodle soup.   The restaurant has a great combo option where you can get large or small bowls of pho- your choice, with a drink or spring/summer rolls. There's even a big combo option that allows you to get a large pho, banh mi (Vietnamese sandwich), and a drink for a fairly decent price. My new favorite item to get there is the Bun bo hue soup. It's a beef noodle soup mixed in with delicious spices, and definitely worth a try! Another must have is the Vietnamese iced coffee! That stuff is so addictive! The coffee slowly drips and once it's completed, you add it to the glass with condensed milk and ice. The papaya salad with pork jerky is refreshing and sweet, perfect for a warm day. As for rice dishes, I've had the grilled marinated pork on broken rice, the curry beef on rice and I've also tried the Bo luc lac...all of which are great!! I will be back for sure Superior Pho!"}
{"text":"Everything was delicious!!  Would almost make a trip to Cleveland just for their pho! :) Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"I had the pho and the bubble tea. Pho was good with a lot of beef and tasty broth but it doesn't match 4.5 stars on Yelp... They don't have that kind of pho has everything in it. For the pho I would give it 3.5 stars.  However the bubble tea was so bad. I told them I wanted a milk tea  traditional bubble tea which is not on the menu but they said they could make it. guess what I got a vanilla bean bubble tea which is way too sweet for me and it was $4.5. Very disappointed! I would give it no stars for the bubble tea.  DO NOT GET THE BUBBLE TEA HERE."}
{"text":"Try the vermicelli noodles - they're awesome! I love this place. Great food, fast service, friendly staff."}
{"text":"Garlic flavor soup base makes Bun boo hue soup with summer roll a perfect match. Meal 8 is a great option to try!"}
{"text":"There's usually a large debate as to who's got the best pho between superior pho and number 1 pho. While I rate #1 pho with 4 stars, I am giving my crowne title of best pho in Cleveland chinatown to Superior Pho.  Superior pho is located inside of the golden plaza (across from the now defunct golden bakery). Aside from the delicious pho dishes, they have excellent pork salad, stuffed rice paper rolls, vietnamese pork sandwiches and other appetizers. They also serve decent bubble tea, which makes the perfect pairing with a spicy pork dish.  What really drives it home is that the noodles at superior I had were definitely cooked better than the ones I got at #1 pho.  The debate will continue, but with the two best pho restaurants literally across the street from eachother, it's a showdown that will last for years to come."}
{"text":"I WILL RETURN OVER AND OVER AGAIN!! Their lunch special #12 ( I think?) is the best thing on earth. A huge bowl of Pho with all the meat AND a bahn mi for $12. I don't know what else you could ask for. The service is exceptional and quick. There are so many pho places on the street, but I haven't made it to half of them because superior pho keeps pulling me back in."}
{"text":"They are quick and convenient. Pho is good but of course homemade is always better!  The bubble tea is good!"}
{"text":"I love this place service and food are always great if your in Cleveland and you want pho you can't go wrong with superior pho."}
{"text":"This is the worse excuse for Vietnamese pho. I'm originally from the Dallas area and lived in Vegas for 5 years bedfore moving  back to the Cbus and this I can tell you was THE MOST disappointing meal I have ever eaten when it comes to Vietnamese cuisine. How do you have Pho Dac Biet with out the meatballs??? 1.50 extra for 1 meatball sliced into 4's. I ordered the traditional Banh Mi asked for extra Pate and the waiter says $2 extra yikes it wasnt even duck or goos fois gras definitely wasnt from Sonoma Artisan Foie Gras so no idea why the pate would be so extra!!! Price gouging and unrealistic. Out of a party of 8, 5 were vietnamese and i wish i could put their facial reactions on here. Regardless none of us finished our plates."}
{"text":"Fee-fi-PHO-fum I smell the broth of Vietnam. Topped with basil, lime, bean spouts and peppers  My oh my, Pho couldn't possibly get any better."}
{"text":"Best Pho in town! They have many pho options to choose from and they are all amazing and super authentic. The portion sizes are very large, which is great, you can eat it all or have a great amount for leftovers! They give you a bunch of accompaniments, too! My go to is the #8, great variations of the meats. The #2 is also delicious and the most authentic (as you cook the raw beef in the broth).   We also got the \"7C bahn mi\" which was SO delicious too, even the bread was the perfect crisp on the outside, soft on the inside.   We went here twice in one week - once on a Saturday night, which they were pretty busy but still their service was quick. Their take out is also super quick and professional! They give you all the necessary accompaniments and package smartly.   Definitely recommend - our go-to pho spot! A great bang for your buck as you can swing 2 meals out of it. Parking is in back."}
{"text":"The first time I ever had pho or a banh mi. I came here on the recommendation of the Food Networks Michael Simon. Im so glad I did.  Best soup and and sandwich I ever had. And its the base for which I judge every pho and bahn mi I've eaten since."}
{"text":"Fantastic. I only had pho for the first time a year ago and have been to this restaurant at least a dozen times, and its never on the way.  Great food, Great portions, Great Price, Served Quick.   I've had a few other pho places, and the food isn't quite as good, and the price is always a little more expensive.  Although one time I went here and they didn't have the bean sprouts for the pho!!! other than that, it's always been a great experience (and honestly, the sprouts didn't ruin it for me."}
{"text":"Best Pho in Cleveland as the name indicates. The place is hole in the wall, hidden and located in some old building. What impresses me about Superior Pho is its consistently delicious food. It continues to serve one the best Pho I've had although I heard the west coast has even better to offer. Pretty cheap especially if you get the combo but you can get it cheaper in NYC. Pho is incredible (thanks to the broth), Bun Bo Hue is excellent, Vietnamese sandwich is tasty, and broken rice dish is pretty good. The atmosphere and service leave a bit to be desired but I'm mainly there for some good comfort food.  There's another Vietnamese restaurant (#1 Pho) close by and it's hard not to make some sort of comparison. #1 Pho is like a girl with nice appearance but without personality. Superior Pho is clearly the winner when it comes to flavor and certainly my favorite Asian comfort food joint in NE Ohio."}
{"text":"A fantastic place for quick, delicious pho. My first experience here was for takeout. We called in and placed our order and asked how long it would take. The response? 7 minutes. We were 20 minutes away! But they agreed to cook it once we were closer, which was great :) You can't beat that kind of service!  The second time I came, I ordered a thai coffee bubble tea in addition to my meal. The appetizers and pho came out within 7 minutes, but I was confused because my coffee hadn't arrived yet. Why did it take longer? They brewed it fresh.  That's what I love about this place (in addition to taste and large portions): everything is made fresh and all the ingredients are made fresh. They didn't have a pot of lukewarm coffee sitting somewhere, the bean sprouts were crispier than I've ever seen them in a store, and overall the flavors were amazing. I love this place and can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Looking for some good places to eat while in Cleveland, I came across Superior Pho.  This Hole-in-the Wall truly was hard to find; the insides were bare and the decorations close to none.  We ordered the pho, of course.  This was the first and only disappointment.  While the flavor was excellent, the soup was only lukewarm (we like ours piping hot) and the noodles were clumped together, much like the complaints of earlier yelp reviews.  The banh mi sandwich was delicious, stuffed with meat and vegetables on crisp French bread.  Grilled pork on broken rice was special as well: there was something about the marinade in that really made it a home run.  Superior Pho, can you please listen to some Yelp reviews?  The Pho is not yet perfect, but it can be made perfect with just a few small changes.  Listening to criticism makes perfect."}
{"text":"Fairly standard Pho establishment, the serving sizes are huge I just ordered the standard and left more than full. I think the broth could be a little more flavorful but it was good none the less."}
{"text":"The price is amazing for how much food you get. This place offers the best bang for your buck when it comes to the amount of meat they give you in one bowl of pho.  The establishment is in a building and they share a hallway with other restaurants. The decor and tables aren't really much to look at, but the service was prompt. Me and my guy ordered our pho, he got every type of meat and I got brisket and flank steak. We were both impressed with the amount of meat they give you, even noticing our last few bites were meat instead of a couple of noodles.   Characteristics of pho I like/want: Soup should be very hot to cook the meat and break down the bean sprouts we throw in at the table. A good helping of meat and noodles so it is filling in itself Enough bean sprouts, jalapenos, and lime for the table  So far, this is the best pho place in Cleveland. We also at at a place in Woodmere and it wasn't anywhere near the quality you get here. AND IT WAS MORE EXPENSIVE"}
{"text":"Not a crazy huge pho fan, but some friends have long considered this one of their fave places to eat in Cleveland, so I finally ended up joining them. I really should have come here sooner. The pho was great, and even the \"small\" bowl was probably more than enough for one sitting (I ate it all despite having a hellaciously large lunch at Melt). My friends got large bowls plus the bahn mi (I'm too lazy to look if I misspelled that), which looked and smelled FANTASTIC. I will certainly be back here soon, ideally with a much larger appetite."}
{"text":"Love their pho! Authentic Vietnamese food. Broth is absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"It was hard to find, so we had to call, but so worth it! The entrance is not actually on superior, but at the back of the building. We had spring rolls and pho. So good!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a late lunch one afternoon. A bit hard to find, it's located inside an older building - you have to turn off of Superior and pull in behind the building. You enter the building and come into a hallway with a number of businesses. Superior Pho is the first business in the hallway on the left.  Lots of seating here. I picked a table and looked over the menu. Of course I ordered the Pho Ga. After ordering, I asked the server if their Pho Ga was a beef broth or chicken broth. She did not know - but said she would check. She came back and informed me it was a beef broth. I was a bit disappointed - but wanted to keep an open mind (I prefer and lust for delicious Pho Ga made with chicken broth!).  The bowl of Pho Ga was brought out, steaming away. With a fresh plate of aromatics/veggies: Basil, Lime, Jalapeños, and Bean Sprouts. I added all of the ingredients and tasted the broth. Pretty good. The only other criticism I have is that the noodles were a little clumped together - I had to work them a bit with the chopsticks to break the clump up. As always, I added the requisite Sriracha sauce to individual bites - and to the broth at the end before guzzling down the delicious broth.  As I was paying for my meal, I struck up a conversation with the young man at the register. In that conversation, I found that I could have asked for - and received a chicken broth with my Pho Ga. I was thrilled to hear that!  Superior Pho has superior Pho! Can't wait to come back and re-try the Pho Ga with the chicken broth!  Be forewarned - the restrooms are common restrooms for the building - which are down the hall and require a key to get in. All of the businesses in the building share the restrooms. And the restrooms are very old. They need work, maintenance, and more cleaning. Having said this - I doubt Superior Pho is in charge of the building's restrooms.  Superior Pho - definitely a great place for Pho!"}
{"text":"Went here after craving some pho on a recent trip to Cleveland. This place has pretty good pho from what I tasted, however because I have pho ALL THE TIME, i tried their vermecilli with beef and spring rolls. It was pretty good, with crispy spring rolls and a good fish sauce. Also tried their boba here which is not the best but does the job! Also got one of their banh mi to go, which was expensive but acceptable. There isnt many banh mi shops around the city like socal does, but its not the worst ive ever had!  The ambience is a little dark and a little divey, however the staff is very friendly and english friendly! Seating could be a little cramped, hey I can live with it!  If i ever find myself in Cleveland again, ill defintely give this spot another go."}
{"text":"I like that its more low-key than its neighbor #1.  Younger crowd...less douchy power lunch types that yap the whole time about mergers and their Audi payment.  The Pho I like better but #1 has that awesome barbeque beef dish with the dipping sauce.  The spring rolls are better than any ive had in Cleveland too!  No beer or this place would have 5 stizzars!"}
{"text":"I'm always on the hunt for great pho and this place was highly recommended. I was not disappointed! I ordered a large #2, and slammed the whole bowl- broth was great, clear not cloudy, not overly salted like so many can be, and they give you a good amount of add-ins, they don't scrimp on the fresh basil. The fried pork spring rolls were pretty much perfect, so crispy crunchy and not at all greasy, pork was seasoned right. I split a banh mi (the 7c) with the hubs and I was a little disappointed that the bread was not at all crispy and I couldn't detect the pate or the mayo but it was actually still decent.  That and spotty service took away a star but I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I went to Superior Pho yesterday with two of my friends, since we've read such great reviews about the place.  We got there and parked in the back, where there is an entrance way to a sort of strip mall looking area.    We got there and were immediately seated in the restaurant.  It had a good amount of seating, as there was the main room where you walk in and the side room to the left where they could also seat people.  Plus, they offer take out so a lot of people who order food do not sit down and eat there.   We were given menus, and were brought out waters.  The waiter quickly came back over to ask what we wanted, and we all ordered.  Our food came out ridiculously fast (I was in shock).  I ordered a combo meal that came with a summer roll of your choice, a chicken cabbage salad, a small pho, and a drink.  My summer roll and salad came out first before anyone else's meal.    The summer roll was okay, it was my first time having a summer roll so I think that it might not be for me.  However, the chicken cabbage salad was AMAZING.  Seriously, it was the best part of my meal and I will definitely be ordering a larger portion next time.  They also give you chopsticks to eat everything with, and I was never brought out a fork (although my friend was).    Next, all three of our main dishes were brought out (2 phos and one vegetarian dish with tofu).  I ordered the pho that came with the steak and the brisket, and it was really good.  The broth was great, and the meat was very tender.  The pho also came with noodles in it, so it was quite filling.  Also, at each table were 2 sauces: plum sauce and sriracha, which add a nice twist to the pho.  I also tried the vegetarian dish with the tofu, and I thought it was really good as well.    I can't wait to go back and try another dish, and am so happy I decided to go out and try it!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Vietnamese restaurant in northeast Ohio. While I don't eat pho very often, I do frequently order the shredded pork with broken rice from this restaurant.  The pork here is very well seasoned and the texture is so soft that it just melts in your mouth. I got their banh mi last time I was here, and I loved it. The bubble tea here is solid as well. I brought my friend here recently - she got the pho and really liked it. This is the place to go to if you live in the Cleveland area and are looking for a Vietnamese fix."}
{"text":"THE GOOD:  Hands down, best authentic Pho in town.  THE BAD:  Spring rolls are on the mushier side.  Sometimes the vermicelli gets a little overcooked.  And sometimes (GASP) they run out of limes, so bring your own stash if you're a diehard Pho fan like me who wouldn't survive without all the requisite fixins.  THE EVEN BETTER:   The 3B combo under the Bún dishes is a guaranteed winner even for those new to Vietnamese food.  Their grilled marinated pork has just the perfect amount of sweet, salty, smoky and tender most carnivores dream of in the ideal meat morsel.  They make a mean taro boba tea shake, which is only my most favorite non-alcoholic beverage in the whole wide world.  And best of all, service is über fast.  As in breakneck fast.  As in, for what you get, it doesn't seem humanly possible to produce the kind of made-in-your-Southeast-Asian-grandma's-kitchen-over-a-sweltering-hot-stove-for-10-hours dishes all these underage-looking juveniles keep bringing to your cluttered table within 10 minutes of you ordering because you can't stop eating, you glutton.  And by you, I mean me.  DON'T TALK TO ME TILL YOU'VE TRIED THIS: Off the Pho menu: #12, large.  Pho FTW.  PhoTW!!  TRASHTALK: Before you go, becuase you're obviously going to go if you haven't yet, for the love of god Clevelanders, let's say it right. It's Pho, as in \"fuh?\" and not \"foe\".  I'm looking at you too, Asian Clevelanders.  You know you're guilty.  Like WTF? without the K at the end, if that makes it any clearer.  Or just listen to the wiki dude: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/be/Ph%E1%BB%9F.oga  To demonstrate: http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_U9BzvRlALaM/SCxWbkCKC5I/AAAAAAAAABI/6MCo0Lwk4gY/s320/phoshizzle.gif  http://blog.sigsiv.com/project365/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/365-003.jpg"}
{"text":"My GO-TO spot for Pho in the grand city of Cleveland.   Although I usually go for one thing and one thing only, the Pho Ga, AKA pho with chicken, I have ordered a side or two in the past, like the vietnamese sandwich and chicken cabbage salad. Absolutely everything I've had from here is excellent, flavorful, and hits the spot.   They have a variety of different phos, appetizers, and combo meals to choose from. Tons of sriracha, soy and eel sauce at the table for your using pleasure, and every time I've eaten at the restaurant, the place is crowded, but I'm eating my pho only 5 minutes after ordering. See, this place rocks.   I order pho to go from here frequently, and it comes in very user friendly containers. The broth comes in a separate container, so all you have to do is combine the noods and the broth in a bowl at home and voila, you have pho on your couch in your pajamas.   The service is great. The product is exquisite. Hands down, my favorite pho spot in the city. Did I say that already?"}
{"text":"Decided to bump up the rating. I've been a few more times. Maybe it's been long enough that I've forgotten the bahn mi I had in NY but they're pretty good, don't want to perpetuate my description of them being \"disappointing.\" I just wish they were bigger or less expensive. This sandwich can be had in Denver for $2.50 but it's $4.50 in Cleveland:(  I've had the pho in the past as well but it's been a while and I can't really remember it. I hope to have some more soon but I have no reason to doubt its reputation as the best in the city."}
{"text":"So extremely disappointed with my experience here, and definitely not the best pho in Cleveland (keep looking!). Their menu listing of combinations is not thorough, so it is up to your server to guide you through for first timers. The menu does not state, but you can get a coffee instead and have a discount of 50 cents off its full price. Note that when ordering your summer or spring roll, that you should state the type of roll you get. It would have been nice for the server for clarify with me which roll I would like since it was my first time.   This led to a bad first impression, when I found myself served with a spring roll with absolutely no meat inside. Topping this off was their pho tai, which was also not what I expected. The broth was okay, but the meat was awfully overcooked and clumped together. The meat is supposed to be RARE and really ought to be separated before serving (it's not hard to do!), else the presentation leads to poorly distributed and potentially overlooked meat. (Maybe overcooked to better suit clientele less familiar with Asian cuisine?)  It's also quite expensive for a bowl of pho.   Subpar service, overcooked meat, pricey pho.. I don't plan to come back.  FYI, there is parking in the back if you drive off of US 6 (and you will be closer to the restaurant if you do.)"}
{"text":"Delicious. Best pho I've had yet in Cleveland. Comparable to some of the good spots in LA. Their bahn mi is as good as everyone claims it is, and I rarely eat pork so I am picky about it."}
{"text":"I went to Superior Pho the other day and, lo and behold, Iron Chef Michael Symon was sitting at the big table in the middle, eating his large, steamy bowl of pho :)  Well, it seems like he has made his choice.  I've eaten at all three pho places in Cleveland's Asia Town (Superior Pho, Number One Pho and Pho 99), and Superior Pho is the best, in terms of soup, meat and noodles.  Whenever my friends have pho cravings, we go here.  The service is pretty efficient too - this is the kind of restaurant where you can be in and out quickly if you... had a plane to catch, for instance.  The restaurant is a little bit hidden and the parking lot is sort of sketchy, but you'll always find this restaurant full of people.  Meanwhile, the Korean place in the same building is always practically empty.  Make sure you don't accidentally go to Number One Pho, which is next door and much more visible... but has a distinctly smaller clientele and lower quality broth."}
{"text":"The food is wonderful. The pho is fantastic, with a rich broth and really hearty cuts of beef. The bean sprouts are crisp, and the giant bottles of oyster sauce  and hot sauce are awesome. Great great stuff, and it beats #1 Pho on this end.   However, everything else about the place was pretty lack luster. The table was a bit dirty--I had to brush a used napkin off my seat before sitting down. The service was prompt when you sat down, but we never got a check in or assistance after the bowls arrived. The atmosphere is fine for a hole-in-the-wall joint, but I did think $8 for a bowl was steep when you consider you can relax a bit more over at #1 for a dollar more."}
{"text":"This restaurant was great- a hidden gem off the back street.  We will definitely return!   I had Bun with beef and my friend had the Pho.  We also had a shrimp roll in rice paper.  It is served with an awesome peanut sauce.  All were delicious.  We have since visited this restaurant so much that one might call us \"regulars.\"  The service is so prompt that you can almost blink you eye after ordering and the food appears.  The spicy and regular pho are very good."}
{"text":"This place always has fast, friendly service and tasty pho. I love getting the combination bowl and their sizes are huge - even a small is good for two meals for me! Consistently delicious and a great, cozy atmosphere. Perfect place to warm up during these cold winter months :) I've only ever had the pho, I'll try and make it back and try something different!"}
{"text":"This is the best place in Cleveland for Pho. Period.  (OK... a bit more...) The owner is awesome - very friendly and always greets us with enthusiasm. The Pho is top notch as are the Cha Gho spring rolls (is that appropriate to call them spring rolls?). Love all the fresh ingredients that go into this Pho. Getting take-out is a bit involved (mix everything yourself) but then I had a chance to see how fresh ALL of it is. Nice.   The place is out of the way - you have to know how to get here. But it's fantastic!  Better service, food and prices than #1 Pho. Go Superior Pho!"}
{"text":"OM NOM NOM NOM.   That's the only sounds I made today while dining, for the first time, at Superior Pho.  It was my birthday and I wanted to try something completely out of the norm and BOY, am I glad I did.  It was crowded and the parking lot was nearly full. So full, in fact, that we had to park near a (thankfully empty) dumpster, yummy!  Although pretty packed inside, we were seated within 3 minutes of arriving. Let me tell ya - they are FAST! We ordered our food (Meal 1: Spring roll & a small pho for me, Meal 6: Spring roll, grilled marinated pork on broken rice for my husband), appetizer (Cha gio) and strawberry boboa teas (omg, so good). Our food and appetizers arrived at once which would have usually been an issue but hey, they were so quick and nice, there were no complaints from us. We literally ordered our food and within 5-7 minutes, our freshly prepared food had arrived!  The food was so delicious, we ordered spring rolls to go. The peanut sauce is to DIE/KILL for, depending on what you're into.  This will surely be a monthly trip for me, from now on. It's too friggin delectable not to be!"}
{"text":"Everything we've ever had here is so good. The pho is great and warming; the broken rice dishes are so flavorful; the banh mi is rich and amazing; and the bubble tea is perfect. Don't miss out."}
{"text":"The brisket pho is really delicious - incredible broth, garnished with crispy mung bean sprouts, and a slice of lime. The bubble tea is more of a slush than a traditional tea- but is also pretty tasty."}
{"text":"This place is tucked away, but worth the trip.   I stayed in Cleveland for a few days on business and walked here from downtown. The mini-mall it resides in, emphasis on mini, is a strange but fun little place to briefly walk through as well.  To the point, this place will leave you uber satisfied. I had the Vietnamese Sandwich and Pho with all sorts of different meat. The sandwich has no flaw, imo. The bread was the most surprising and important part of the sandwich. All the veggies and herbs are nice and fresh and add the necessary crunch to go with the homemade pate and roasted pork.   The pho, no words needed. Go there, get it, love it. Be sure to throw in all those bean sprouts and thai basil they provide you. Maybe even ask for some extra cilantro, one can never have too much cilantro. If ya need heat, which is a must, they provide nothing but the best, Siracha/Rooster Sauce.   The ice coffee was damn good too! Plus, its inexpensive.  Service is adequate, its fast and cheap dining so don't act like you need more than what they give."}
{"text":"I hate to give this place 2 stars because the service was friendly. BUT the food was meh. I'm not Vietnamese, but I am a SoCal native and have had a good share of decently authentic Vietnamese food (not to mention I visited Vietnam this past summer)  Came with a friend and ordered pho and bunbohue. The pho broth was watery and missing the rather subtle rich flavor that makes it so good. Bunbohue had a similar problem - soup was too bland and didn't have that flavorful kick that makes it so addicting.   As stated above, the service was good and friendly. But besides that this place is a no-go."}
{"text":"I want to start off by saying that I have been here two times prior to my most recent trip to Superior Pho and my pho (#12) was really great, so this review is not based off of just first time try and fail.   That being said, the service here has always left something to be desired. I was sat in the back room (may or may not contributed to the service being worse than usual) where I made sure to put in my beverage order and food order for myself and my friend, because I know how often they come back to the table after taking the drink orders. I ordered two number #12's and a Bahn Mi to split between myself and my friend.   The phos came out in a reasonable amount of time, but the broth tasted a little off compared to the two times prior I had eaten there. It wasn't as flavorful as I remembered so I just chalked it up to the restaurant having a little off day, it happens.  It wasn't until we had been waiting a good 15-20 minutes after we had gotten our bowls of pho where I kindly reminded one of the servers/food runners that we also had ordered a Bahn Mi sandwich, also asking for a side plate to split the sandwhich. Another 10 minutes goes by and the busser asks us if we are done with our meal, which we let him know that we were still waiting on our sandwhich. A few minutes later, the server I stopped about our sandwhich asks if we had received it yet, we hadn't. Another few minutes pass by and the sandwich finally arrived. All the while, our original server who took our order was nowhere to be found after our initial order was taken.  Since I have had good experiences with the food previously I will probably be back, but the service here needs a tweak. The food runners seem to have a constant look of confusion when they are attempting to figure out which table each meal belongs to (probably not their fault)."}
{"text":"The best place for pho in Cleveland - and I have tried all of them. The awards on the wall seem to agree with me. It tastes better and is also slightly cheaper than Number 1 Pho nearby, which I don't quite understand. Since I come here only when I have the craving for pho, I haven't ordered anything else besides the appetizers and banh mi sandwiches despite coming here for years.  There is a generous amount of beef, and the broth is clear and tasty without being overly salty. There is no post-MSG-consumption headache here, which I really appreciate. You are given a large plate of possible condiments including basil, chili pepper, bean sprouts, and lime. I generally add in all of the bean sprouts (it gives me the warm fuzzy feeling that I am actually having a healthy meal), as well as the basil and chili pepper. I do not use the sweet plum sauce nor the sriracha, but if you want to, it is probably best to squeeze it out onto the plate and dip the meat into it. I have seen some people put it into the soup directly, but that seems like it would distort the taste of the broth.  This place is actually pretty busy during peak hours, but I have never actually had to wait for a seat. The pho comes out almost immediately after you order it (in fact the appetizer usually takes longer), and you pay at the counter up front prior to leaving. Service is efficient and polite. The décor is quite plain and unassuming, but this is definitely one of those places where you're paying for the food, and personally I tend not to notice when I am too busy inhaling the noodles."}
{"text":"My wife quipped Mediocre Pho. We have been to great Pho places all over -including LA, NY, Chicago, Seoul, London, and even Des Moines, IA. I want to like this place -it is bright and clean and well staffed, but the service was uneven. The broth which is the heart of the Pho was barely there. It wasn't salty is the best I can come up. The meat was not good quality. It was fresh enough, but had no good structure or flavor, likely because it was overboiled. The vegetables were fresh. The sauces were clean and and fresh. Place is always crowded with people who haven't had amazing Pho which is that perfect match of raw and cooked, chewy and crunchy, light but substantial. You can say it was an off day, but this is the second time I have eaten here and was disappointed.   The bun ch'a gio thin nit thuong (sp?) had the same problems -the spring rolls were mushy with mystery meat, the pork was okay.   The iced coffee was good."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get pho in Cleveland.  I like to get the #3 Ph tái chín and pork spring rolls.  The pho is simply amazing.  The broth is tasty with ample noodles and beef.  If you have enough appetite, get the large bowl.  When you are served your pho, a side plate of basil, sliced chili, limes and bean sprouts.  Add as much of the garnishment as you want to suit your taste. Service is A+ and there's convenient parking located at the back of the building. A super busy lunch crowd.  You know this place is doing things right.    It's hard not to keep coming back here."}
{"text":"Deeeeeeeelicious. It isn't my most favorite pho place of all time, but it certainly is my top preference for the Cleveland area. Sometimes the noodles are overcooked, but that's not a huge deal. Broth is top notch. I love how they have combo meal options!  One bad thing: They close really early..."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite pho spot in Cleveland. Cheap. Delicious broth. Very fresh vegetables. The banh mi is okay. I would not recommend getting the bun bo hue. It tastes like they used the pho broth with it. With that said, their pho definitely fulfills my craving whenever I'm missing home or just craving Vietnamese food. Love the casual atmosphere that other pho restaurants lack."}
{"text":"By far my favorite place for a quick hot meal. A large bowl of hot pho is the best thing when you're sick, when it's cold, when it's hot, when you need comfort food, etc.  Superior Pho does pho well - some places will have lukewarm soup (my biggest pet peeve regarding pho), or the soup will have strange additional flavors. The broth here is steaming hot and refreshingly clean. I always get #12 (dac biet), which has a wide variety of meats. They aren't stingy with their toppings plate either, which is usually heaped with copious bean sprouts, jalapeno slices, and Thai basil.  Service is what you would expect for a no-nonsense Asian restaurant: quick and to-the-point, which I appreciate.  Lastly, the restaurant is located in the back lot behind Phusion Cafe. Pull into the parking lot using one of the side roads off Superior for a beeline to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Hard to find hole in the wall in the middle of Chinatown Cleveland? It just HAS to be good, right?   Well, I'm only here to confirm what most reviews have already echoed... Best pho in Cleveland!   I've only recently gotten on the pho hype train but I have had a few places and this is by far the best, the taste echoes the hard work that goes into the fantastic broth every day.  Do yourself a favor, stop reading reviews and just click the get directions button... You won't be disappointed.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I love my fiancée for many reasons, one of which is for introducing me to pho! (Best hangover cure in the world). I wish I could say I knew more so I could judge pho well. At this point, I know the pho served here is pretty good. A little pricey for pho, but the best in Cleveland."}
{"text":"On a cross country trip we stopped here for pho (mainly based on Yelp reviews) and MAN oh MAN we were NOT disappointed!  Located in a weird building (in what seemed to be an industrial part of town) is this AMAZINGLY fabulous Pho restaurant...the BROTH is some of the BEST I have EVER tasted....see i can't stop capitalizing because thats how passionate I am about good tasting Pho Broth...If i could take this place home with me.....yummmmmm.......go here."}
{"text":"Great place and the best pho I've had in town (I have not had them all yet). The banh mi is very good and classic, but I prefer Saigon Grille's (that's just me). They had an incredibly good green papaya salad with pork jerky last time I was there, but it had yet to make it on the printed menu, so no promises. As mentioned in other reviews, the place is somewhat lacking in creature comforts, but I think that adds to the ambiance. I'll be back to try more dishes if I can keep my maw out of the vats of soup."}
{"text":"no other word but to describe the food other than SPECTACULAR .. went there for the 1st time this past weekend .. had the Pho #2 .. my husband had the Pho #13 .. we split a Bahn Mi (neither of us had tried one b/4) & then wished we each had our own .. we will definitely be back .. has got to be the best Pho in the city!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here I order the number 3 small pho and it never disappoints me! I also love their summer rolls with the shrimp! So delicious!!!! Highly recommended!! I also bring all of my out of town guests here because of how good the food is!"}
{"text":"The pho here is pretty good, and you'll be hard pressed to find anywhere here in Cleveland where they have Vietnamese sandwiches, one of my favorite Vietnamese foods.  The sandwich is good, but I've had better at other places.  They have bubble tea here too.  I've tried several different flavors, and while some of them can be a little bland, I like the strawberry the best."}
{"text":"The problem I usually have with pho is that I often leave hungry, even when I order the largest size on the menu.  So when I went to Superior Pho, in preparation I ordered an appetizer along with the large pho with everything in it.  I even asked to have meatballs added for an extra dollar.  It turns out I didn't need to buy the appetizer.  The pho was very filling and is my favorite in Cleveland.  There were generous portions of meat and the broth was delicious.  Definitely coming back for more!"}
{"text":"AWFUL!!  Ordered a vegetarian dish, that says \"Curry vegetables\". I got boiled cauliflower and broccoli on bed of overlooked white rice, no curry, no spice at all. Which asian restaurant serves bland food? I have no idea how this restaurant got great reviews. I would go to Bac in Tremont or Saigaon on East 4th. My buddy had an average experience, he added ton of Sriracha as well. If you are a meat/potato guy and never tried Asian food before, this for you. If you are well travelled and enjoy deep flavors/texture, stay away from this place."}
{"text":"I just have to say.. amazing spring rolls. A-mazing. Pho was alright, could have had a better broth. But those spring rolls. Just amazing. This place seems to be a favorite. :)"}
{"text":"I'd only had pho twice before I went to Superior Pho, and it was from the other two pho places.  I'd heard that Superior was the place to be, but I generally take restaurant suggestions with a huge grain of salt.    Honestly, I wish I wouldn't.  Superior's prices and portions are just insane.  I get the pho dac biet and butcher the pronunciation horribly.  The staff is friendly and businesslike without being overbearing;  they leave me to messily slurp down my noodles and beef.   When they say rare beef, the do mean rare beef.  It's never overcooked or too rare, and the tendons and tripe just fall apart on your tongue.    The Vietnamese coffee is something I need to experience more.  I generally take coffee black, with no cream, because I like the sharper and more bitter taste.  I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but their coffee had that sharpness, even with the cream.    Just go here.  That's really all I have to say."}
{"text":"This little hard-to-find place is truly a gem.   It's behind a building in Cleveland's Asiatown, just east of the E. 30th and Payne intersection, on Payne.  The menu seems to be pretty basic, based on Pho and Bun, with a good selection of spring rolls. I prefer Bun, and it came to me hot and fresh and the beef was tender and delicious. Service was fast and friendly. The price compared to #1 pho around the corner is cheaper, but it is a smaller type of quick-lunch establishment. There are also combination platters that seem like a good deal as well.  Try the taro flavored bubble tea! If you're not familiar, it tasted similar to a vanilla milkshake. With tapioca bubbles, which would be similar to gummy bears in texture. It's just something you have to try at least once when you eat at any asian restaurant!"}
{"text":"This place has simply the best pho in Cleveland. Along with this the Vietnamese sandwich and the Bi Cuon appetizer are great as well. I would definitely recommend ordering one of the pho's with brisket in it. To accompany the great food, the service is excellent as well. You will not be disappointed with Superior Pho!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing and very authentic! The bubble tea was more of a smoothie not like what I had while in California but delicious nonetheless! I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Pho is all about the soup. Every time we come here the more watered down the soup becomes. Even my Caucasian friends could taste the difference. It used to be good. One more Asian restaurant gone downhill."}
{"text":"Solid.  After a long wedding, pho is the best always to cure a hangover!  The pho makes it happen.  - Grilled Pork Spring Rolls: Light, tasty, and a great starter. - Beef Pho:  Decently flavored broth, beef quality was decent and good.  Overall. This was a great spot to cure that hangover.  It's clean, and has overall good flavor."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this restaurant and also my first time trying pho. It was a pretty good experience. I'm typically nervous about trying new foods. Fortunately, I had gone with a friend who had been here before. She was able to guide me through my questions, my first one being \"where is this place?!\" Like others have mentioned, there is a parking lot and entrance in the rear of the building which was a bit confusing.   There was little interaction with the staff other than ordering and paying for the food which I didn't mind. For the meal itself, I tried the pho with chicken in it. The difference between the two sizes was only about a dollar so the large size was worth it.  Prepare to get lots of practice with chop sticks. The meal probably took me twice as long to eat as it should but I was determined to master my technique.  It was delicious, filling, and has convinced me to come back and try a different dish."}
{"text":"Always come here for pho. Portions are huge and prices are great. Service can be weird but it's always quick and courteous."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to this place because I had heard si many good things about it. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. I grew up on Vietnamese food and prepare it myself, but the restaurant used some low quality ingredients . I ordered the traditional pho for my kids and bun Bo hue for myself. I also ordered a lychee bubble tea and summer roll. The bubble tea wasn't bad, it was the slushy kind instead if the milky kind that I like better. The summer roll was okay but their peanut sauce was thin and not very flavorful. It wasn't rolled very well. As soon the soups arrived, I smelled a particular msg- loaded spice package that is often substituted for more authentic spices and seasoning. I couldn't tell if it was the bun Bo hue or the pho,so tasted both broths and it was in both. The bun Bo hue was not spicy or lemongrass- sy, and was extremely thin, the coloring was almost clear, no pigs blood. I had to add more fish sauce and all the jalapeños ( which you don't do with this dish) to get some heat. The noodle portion was really small. I would not call this bun bo hue because it had almost none of the traditional elements found in it. The pho was a better, but also very one dimensional tasting and I could taste some if the cheap pre- packaged seasoning in it. They definitely skimped on the anise, clove, onion, and ginger flavoring that is characteristic of more complex, flavorful broths. The noodle portion was better and was splittable between my two kids. But neither of my kids finished it, which is a definite sign that they have had better. Because I wanted to try a wide variety, I ordered the broken rice and banh mi to go. My husband didn't think highly of the broken rice and the banh mi was not great. The bread did not have the right crispiness in the outside and chewiness on the inside, and the meat was some sort of mystery meat I had never tasted and made the bread mushy. No jalapeños. Overall, not the worst I've had but I won't be coming back and will stick to what I can produce in my own kitchen."}
{"text":"Visited Superior Pho on 7-29-2014. As a restaurant it's okay. Tiny room and short on space. The pho itself is pretty good. I felt my Pho Tai could have been a little more flavorful. Overall, it was an okay pho to satisfy those pho cravings one might get. The spring rolls with the sauce were actually really good. One of the best rolls and sauce I've had to date. The honeydew bubble tea reminded me of tapioca express in California which is a good thing.  The pricing, in my opinion, is a perfect for the serving portion."}
{"text":"Feel very lucky to have 2 quality Vietnamese places in the neighborhood, but Superior is my favorite. The pho is excellent, and if you're not feeling like beef, you can get the vegetable pho with some tofu thrown in, both broths are sooo good. Fried rice and bun are really tasty as well, and this place definitely rivals the best places in nyc, with much better service."}
{"text":"Writing a review mostly for the Vietnamese iced coffee which is bae. I love how it's consistently very strong and slightly sweet, like how love should be. The only two vegetarian options- the curry stir-fried vegetables with rice and vermicelli noodles with tofu weren't so bad either, though the rice dish could use a lot more curry. The spicy peanut sauce that came with the tofu summer rolls was also delicious, definitely a good homemade sauce. Reminded me of my mom's. Disappointed that they don't have pho made from vegetarian broth, get on that!  I haven't been here long enough to really say anything about the service but it's pretty obvious the college-age waiters don't have enough serving experience; they remind me of myself when I tried to be a server, giving dishes to the wrong customer and mishearing things. One of them even thought the Francisco Lachowski look-alike next to us was in my family haha.  Did I really give this place 4 stars just because of the coffee? Yes."}
{"text":"Loved this place the pho was great, but the fried rice was what will bring me back. It was probably the best fried rice I've ever eaten, and that hoisin sauce is the key to the whole dish. So so so good and make sure you get a bubble tea to go."}
{"text":"Between the reviews and the pictures, my mouth was watering for some serious pho etc, and I got down to Superior Pho's the first chance I could.  It was early on a Sunday, and there were very few people in the nicely inviting little restaurant.   Have to give you a serious hint to parking - once you get onto Superior Ave off of 90 E, you will come to E 30th and E31st.  Just make a right onto E 31st and a right into the parking lot behind the restaurant - it's clearly marked.  The facade on Superior Avenue is very confusing, so realize that the TRUE facade is on the parking-lot side.  At least on Sundays.    As for the food.  Oh my gosh, I can wax poetic, ecstatic and everything else, but I cannot truly tell you in words just how satisfying it is.  The pho choices are many, but they are really not complicated at all.  It's just a matter of how many different cuts of meat you want in your soup*.  Simple.  I ordered the #12, because it had all but the meatballs, and it was supreme.  Second time, I ordered the #3, and it was just as supreme.  The price for a large pho is $7.95 down the line, so you're going to get as much meat in a number 12 as you are a number 1.  Ahhhhhh.  Makes no difference.  For anyone interested, a large bowl is definitely a meal.  My first visit, I ordered some rice rolls and a bubble tea in addition to my pho, and I had to walk about four miles when I got home just to ease my belly fullness.  Second trip, narrowed it down to just the soup and tea, and I was still pretty full, but comfortable.    Right now, considering prices, what's in and what's not, basic value, ambiance, lack-of, etc etc, Superior Pho is my favorite restaurant in the city, and I'm a foodie:)  *PS Pho Ga is CHICKEN soup.  I'm just referring to straight Pho (pronounced Fuh)."}
{"text":"The bun house special was so good! I really enjoyed the meal. Shrimp was peeled for you too. That made eating easy. Eat the spring roll first so it doesnt get soggy."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of doing the Superior/#1 Pho taste show-down last week.   Superior won. The broth had more flavor, the noodles were a better consistency and the meat was perfectly cooked. And unlike #1 Pho, the tables have enough sauce for everyone, not just minuscule amounts to pour on the pho.  Service was far more hit than miss. But the place is small enough it was easy to catch the server's eye.  But Ferrett is correct. If you go in through the front it is the building with a red awning. Through the soul food restaurant, past the CPAs office. Into the hallway. Past the other restaurant and the knick-knack store. Down the rabbit hole... and into Cleveland's best pho."}
{"text":"Don't be frightened by the neighborhood or the busted Uhaul truck that has sat in the parking lot for a decade.  Superior Pho is consistently the best Pho I've ever had.  The baguette sandwiches (Bau Mi?) are especially good.  They keep this place clean and service is excellent.  Prices are very reasonable.  They even have bubble tea!"}
{"text":"What can I say?  The Pho tastes great and the Bahn Mi ( Item 7c on the menu) is spectacular.  I've been eating here for years and it just keeps getting more popular.  If you waant to split an amazing pho ( and maybe a 7c ) with a friend, then try the XXL with extra noodles, extra meat and extra meatballs.  It is a gluttonous affair if eating alone, but if you like meat and pho, you should try it at least once.  Most times, I prefer pho tai ( #2) and splitting a 7c with a friend.  The bubble tea is great for the summer and if you are lucky, you might be able to get the durian bubble tea with real durian.    If you are going for lunch, try and go early or late, since it can get busy.  But, take out is always a good option."}
{"text":"Cleveland's best pho hands down. The broth is always consistent in flavor, the cut of beef is tender and their bánh mì is made fresh which has the right crunch from the baguette and bursting with flavor. The service is always stellar to go along with the stellar food. Have been going here for years and it never disappoints. It's one of my favorite places to eat in all of Cleveland."}
{"text":"I would go to Superior Pho any day of the week, that's pho sho! (Teehee).   Having never tried pho before, I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but was blown away by how flavorful the noodles and broth were! It was one amazing bowl packed with a variety of flavors, making each bite more exciting than the next. Although I acted like a complete animal, slurping and spilling all over my clothes (and other people's clothes), I came away feeling like I had just had a first class meal. The service was quick, the staff friendly, and the overall atmosphere welcoming and wonderful. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"So just came back into the office smelling like pho, but it's all good!  After running around on the streets and in and out of 3030 Superior with my female coworker (who is a Cleveland local) fretting about her safety, we finally realized that Superior pho was in the back of the building, accessible by walking through the front and inside of the chicken wing joint.  Ok, on to the food!  + Beef pho [with all meat}: rice noodles are slippery yet chewy; meat is sliced so thin that it is phenomenally soft and tender, I have never had such delectable meat in my pho before; soup was mediocre, it lacked that deep dark punch of pho flavor that I depend on since I don't add lime, siriacha or hoisin sauce to my pho. + BBQ pork and herb spring roll: the pork is the star of this dish with a great smoky punch with the herb adding a refreshing minty taste; sauce is really condensed and is a must with the roll + Vietnamese iced coffee: just like my favorite pho place back in the San Francisco Bay Area, they bring the drip coffee device to your table to pour the coffee over ice at your leisure. I love this because I enjoy drinking the iced coffee at the end of the meal rather than mixing it with hot pho during the meal  The prices are very reasonable here compared to Saigon in the heart of downtown. However, hate me all you want Cleveland-ites (?), but the pho broth at Superior Pho lags behind that of Saigon.   If you have a car or are in the area of Superior Pho and you want a light lunch that also staves off the gusty cold of the Midwest, make a point to stop in for a bowl!"}
{"text":"Wow...  I couldn't think of a better way to end a horrible day than by eating at Superior Pho.  The food was excellent, the people were nice, and the service was fast.    If you could use a little pick-me-up after a bad day, hit this place and fill your belly with some Vietnamese comfort food."}
{"text":"I've had two of the vegetarian options here and was impressed with both. One was 2V and the other was 4V, a noodle soup and a curry. Nice, unique, complex tastes.  Tips: We didn't wait for our bill. We walked up to the cashier to pay when we had to go. They didn't do \"separate checks\" but they let us pay separately.  Also, the correct way to say pho is \"fa\", not \"fo\"."}
{"text":"A favorite spot for Pho, the location is not very fancy or full of a certain ambiance but  the food is always fresh, delicious and well prepared.  The staff is kind and the do offer take out that is always quick."}
{"text":"Any pho is only as good as its broth and this broth is delicious.  I recommend any beef over the chicken, though I have not tried the vegetarian.  (It's nice that they provide such an option.)  I think that the meal which includes a roll, salad, pho, and drink is a great deal for what you get.  Otherwise, a small pho alone is quite sufficient for one person. The staff here are always polite and conscientious, like they really care about working in such a reputable, if modestly-dressed, restaurant.  Superior only offers the large-sized pho for take-out.  It may not be as large as what you would enjoy dining-in.  However, they send you off with all of your pho components packaged separately (broth, herbs, sauce, noodles and meats) for optimal re-heating.  Construct your own bowl!  Plan accordingly: Superior does not stay opened terribly late, even on weekends."}
{"text":"Great prices, really delicious broth for my pho, and tasty summer rolls. I love the \"hole-in-the-wall\" feel too! I will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Probably the best Vietnamese restaurant you can find in Cleveland. The pho here is fantastic! I come here for lunch at least twice a month. I've had a few of the phos, the spring rolls, and the greens as a side. Everything is fresh, tasty, and never greasy.  Oh, and don't forget to try their sandwich!"}
{"text":"Nothing is better than waking up in a lazy holiday/weekends and have Pho as brunch. Superior Pho is definitely the best Pho in Northeast Ohio. The broth is authentic and flavorful. Not like other Pho places in Cleveland which the soup is full of MSG, you can taste the herb and beef bone soup base blend together. It's comfort food. It's noodle soup lover's best choice !"}
{"text":"Just good solid Pho. Can't say much more. The bubble teas are great. There's truly something for everyone."}
{"text":"Great place, totally recommend it. If you are also looking for something like Lee's Sandwich, they have several options for Vietnamese Sandwiches (Banh Mi) as well. Quality pho and quick service reminds me so much of southern California and the best part is that this is in Cleveland! The only minus is the parking lot during lunch and dinner time, which will reinforce all Asian stereotypes of Asian driving."}
{"text":"I been eating here for few years and my first time writing a review. This place have the best Pho noodle soup in town. Most people may not find this place and usually go to the wrong restaurant.   It's a very healthy eat for us as the food is light and delicious. We love the cabbage salad especially the marinated grilled pork salad. They have a great \"3B\" rice noodles which gives you the rice vermicelli noodles, fried pork spring roll and grilled pork with hot/sour sauce. The Vietnamese coffee finishes off the meal.  Very casual atmosphere and the owners are very nice and friendly. It's Asian fast food."}
{"text":"Great location in Pho Row. The staff are all pretty cool and friendly. Their cafe sua da was great. The banh mi was aiiiite. I have not yet tried their pho but I can't wait to! I've only heard good things about it."}
{"text":"I'd drink their pho broth instead of water if I could. Don't be deceived by the dinginess of the restaurant. It's worth your visit. The owner is a humble man who, by my third trip in, recognized me and always checked in to see how I was doing. Their specials are good as well--- you don't just have to get the pho. The Banh mi is also decent, and I've never had a bad experience with their summer rolls either. Likely the best pho in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Got the watermelon bubble tea and the beef curry with steamed rice. Both arrived very promptly and my servers were very warm and friendly. Bubble tea was $4, beef curry (which was such a large portion size I took home leftovers) was $14.   I loved the artwork throughout the restaurant! I found Superior Phone through Yelp, and I'm glad I did. Was very satisfied with my experience!"}
{"text":"So far ilike what i see. Nice standard cafeteria style. You need key from rest for rest room  Unfortunately, this place did not measure up...at all. The broth was boring, it had nearly no taste to it, at all. The fish sauce was way too tart, and the summer roll that I had was rolled in a rice paper wrapper that tasted more like a tree paper wrapper.  The tea wasn't half bad, but that's about it. I was a very sad panda, so much so that I didn't finish eating either the roll, or the soup..."}
{"text":"I can only say this about Superior Pho. It has the best Pho I've ever had in my life. It's is the standard in which I compare all other Pho to. If you live in Cleveland, this is the place to get Pho"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time.  The Pho was great- warm, flavorful, filling, the shrimp spring rolls (not fried) were also great- fresh and flavorful.  They were very courteous and the service was wonderful.  They even gave us free Jasmine tea while we waited.  We'll go back again.  Great place for a cold Cleveland day or eve."}
{"text":"Food - delicious!! I got the vegetable pho (beef broth) and vietnamese iced coffee. I recommend Superior Pho. I will go back, I want to try the tofu banh mi.  Building - look for the building with the red awning. There is no big Superior Pho sign. If you go in the door on Superior, the restaurant is in the back, through the winding hallway.  Parking - go down E 31st St and on the right in a parking lot, behind the building. There is also street parking on Superior Ave E."}
{"text":"254 reviews couldn't be wrong.  I got there before opening and they still accommodated me.  Appetizer came out quick and HOT, and they timed it just right bringing the pho out.    Some places are extremely oily...this was nice, flavorful broth.  Usual bottles aren't on the table but instead they put the oyster and hot sauce in a small dish with the bean sprouts, lime, basil and jalapeño."}
{"text":"Came here last night for dinner with two friends! This unassuming restaurant is tucked away and you park/enter through the back.   Service is quick and attentive,and you are going to get your food in about 5 minutes. I debated ordering a combo, but I am glad I didn't because just the large pho alone gave me a bowl of leftovers.  I went with number 8 Pho and was excited when a bowl bigger than my head came out piping hot. Squeeze some lime, top with some bean sprouts (be weary of the spiciness of the fresh jalapeno, those don't mess around) and go to town! Slurping pho is anything but classy although there is no other way to eat it!  The pho was way better than I expected, actually I am sitting at work craving some and trying not to drool on my keyboard. The broth is the best part, and be sure to add the sauces on the table for an extra kick! Oh, and you can't being the price for the huge portions!! Can I go back to Superior Pho yet?"}
{"text":"Best place everrrrr!!!"}
{"text":"When I was traveling in Cleveland I had a craving for hot soup. I did my homework for resolving those craving about hot soup, and found this Pho restaurant. Soup was pretty okay if I consider this is Cleveland, and service was pretty nice. In this area Parking is always not so easy. You need go around searching for street parking."}
{"text":"I love this place. Good value, and it tastes great. I always get the #12 pho. The food comes out super fast. It's more of a go in, eat and out dining experience."}
{"text":"Best Pho in Cleveland hands down! It compares to a lot of the place sin the San Francisco area and they are known for their Pho. The owner at this place is a nice guy who greets you when you are at the door, and I order a #4, with extra noodles. Throw in some sriratcha, sprouts and you are all set to go. Also, you have to try their spring rolls they are to die for and perfectly crispy, and you can soak them in the sauce that it comes with (sort of like a light duck sauce). Every time I am in town I go to this place and can honestly say I highly recommend it to all of my friends."}
{"text":"Having come from Boston, it's tough to expect good pho in cleveland. That said, pretty disappointed that a) there is no vegetarian (i.e., meatless/fishless) pho option, and b) the vegetarian options are simple noodle dishes. No complexity in flavor, ingredients don't taste sharp or fresh."}
{"text":"Simple yet excellent bowls of pho. Great place for a quick heartwarming bowl. Unfortunately short hours; closed by 8."}
{"text":"The best PHO in town. There are couple other places in the area but they are not as good. I come here often for lunch with coworkers. Most of the time this place is packed, yep... their pho is that good. I often get #9 special with all meats."}
{"text":"The quality is right there in the name! What more do you want!? No, I do get that it's called Superior Pho because it's on Superior Avenue (or at least I'm guessing that's the true reason) but this place really is the best pho restaurant in Cleveland. My go-to Pho bowl is the pho tai chin, which is a combination of the well-done brisket and eye-round steak. If I'm really ready to smash some food I'll go ahead and get some summer rolls and a banh mi sandwich. For the price you really can't beat the value and how much food you get. You'll walk out of the restaurant ready to take on a food coma!   The table turnaround is pretty quick if by chance there happens to be a wait. The time between ordering and getting your is extremely quick as well. After years of success, I'm still fairly surprised at the lack of upgrades in the aesthetics. Maybe it will always have this \"food court\" type atmosphere, but newer chairs, tables, TVs, paintings/pictures and maybe ambient music wouldn't be so bad. But hey, if it ain't broke, don't try and fix it, am I right??"}
{"text":"This is a required stop anytime I visit Cleveland. I've gone to several Vietnamese restaurants for their pho, but this one is by far and away the best one. I love that the decor is super simple, almost sterile, but that just means the money saved from paying to decorate nicely and being in a hole in the wall spot help increase the quality of the food. The pho broth is amazing, the noodles were done correctly, and I always like to try the house special for variety's sake. My combo meal came with a spring roll, small pho, and a drink. It was exactly what I needed. This place is so awesome even Iron Chef Michael Symon had mentioned on his FB posts how much he likes this place. I wonder if I'll ever run into him."}
{"text":"It's not bad. The place is nice and makes people feel comfortable. Yet the food is a bit overpriced."}
{"text":"Meh.   Average at best.   We eat a lot of pho.   Service was odd at best. The front end staff seemed disorganized and inattentive and certainly not well versed in Vietnamese cuisine or culture. I would rate the service at one star.   The atmosphere was dreary and unkempt.   The food was average. While it was ok for one visit I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to come here again and would choose another option if I happened to be looking for Vietnamese in this part of town.   I'm puzzled as to how they have maintained such high ratings for so long.  Sorry, but not impressed."}
{"text":"There's a reason why this place has such great reviews. Everything I had here was delicious, especially their pho. The staff was very attentive, quick, and polite. The only downside is that it's pretty difficult to find if you don't know where to look, definitely a hole in the wall kind of place. But it's absolutely worth the hype once you find it!"}
{"text":"This is one of my absolute favorites in Cleveland!  Always quick, always delicious, always filling, and always reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Oh my god. You know I need my combo #10.  Superior Pho is THE BEST Vietnamese in Cleveland. I have been to this place 5+ times and have always left so happy with everything and always dying to go back. It's a tad hard to find but it's so, so worth it. Don't be put off by the drab decor and hole-in-the-wall location.   Order a combo of a (small or large) bowl of Pho with beef and a banh mi sandwich. I like to put a bunch of Sriracha in my Pho, for it is a glorious condiment fit for a king. Liberally apply bean sprouts and cilantro and begin negotiating the huge amount of food you've been given.  I generally get pretty reckless with my hot sauce but I can still get the herbaceous and oxtail-ey pho flavor here. The noodles are always just right, and the meat is sliced super thin.   The banh mi is a luscious, crunchy, chewy, crispytastic sandwich mouthsplosion that I've never had better from anywhere than right here at Superior. The pork is perfect, the pate not overpowering, the bread super crispy on the outside. I want one right now.  If you're in the area, it's a crime not to hit up Superior Pho. The food is awesome, it's not expensive, and who cares if you have to walk through a weird lobby to get to the bathroom?  EDIT: I almost forgot! You should try the bubble tea if you are one to dig the boba. Their bubble tea is the chilled, smoothie-milkshakey kind, not the real \"tea\" kind, but it's pretty excellent. It's just about the only place in Cleveland that actually manages to get some damn flavor into the tapioca."}
{"text":"They had a special with pho, drink, and egg rolls! Super good! Loved the variations of pho!"}
{"text":"Disappointed.  Cha gio got served cold on inside, shell was crispy hot.  Pho was ok , not the best."}
{"text":"Very solid place to get Pho. I've gotten the Banh Mi here and that was great too. Pricing is good too! The place doesn't have the best atmosphere, and the bathroom isn't kind of sketchy and not very clean and cold. Also the location in general is a little sketchy. I've heard of people's cars getting broken into parked around this area, keep your valuables in the trunk/with you."}
{"text":"Superior was okay. I prefer Saigon Grille's Bahn Mi and Pho."}
{"text":"Not that I've tried tons of Vietnamese, but the pho was pretty much all I imagined it would be. I had the #13 (I believe) lunch special with ph tái chín - pho with brisket and steak - and it was delicious. Served with a side of fresh bean sprouts, jalapenos (or maybe serranos), and mint. The broth was already seasoned well and delicious, and had some scallions already in it along with the meat. I also got an order of the summer rolls. They were amazing and comparable to authentic, home made ones I have had in the past. I also tried the fried spring roll - nothing special. Definitely get the hot coffee. It's served in a plastic cup with condensed milk on the bottom, and a coffee strainer on top... you wait for it to drip out and stir your condensed milk along with it. It was way too sweet, but next time I know not to get the condensed milk.   My friend had the chicken fried rice (so boring), and loved it... I guess.   Parking is in the back and it's fairly large so no worries about spots. The restaurant is located in an old building on Superior on the first floor and is super hidden with the entrance in the back, with a few other Asian restaurants on the same floor (Taiwanese, Korean, Japanese). The staff was awesome and friendly. Definitely going back in the fall and winter!"}
{"text":"#1 #1 make sure you get it the broth was amazing I could just drink the juice from this soup. Waiters are so nice and friendly and good is so good was super surpise coming from California to Cleveland and eating pho here. I would come back if I ever come back to Cleveland"}
{"text":"Paid 35.00 and took two bites and left. Have a \"vegetarian\" section - which I ordered from- tofu was cooked in chicken grease and came with fish sauce. Gross ambiance - sticky floor and crumbled food on the ground. Don't use the bathroom down the hall - you will lose your appetite. Not sure why this place has great reviews. It is terrible !!!! Total shit way to spend an evening."}
{"text":"Superior Pho is awesome.  There are many pho places in Cleveland. Important criteria for pho: price and soup. Pho here is very affordable at around $6 for small and $7 for large. And the soup! It's soooo good. Better than its competitors for sure.  The next time it's kinda chilly and rainy, hit Superior Pho."}
{"text":"To add to the Superior Pho vs. #1 Pho debate, I actually think the beef at #1 Pho is better, but the soup is way better at Superior Pho. Also Superior Pho is quite a bit cheaper.  Superior Pho is a great pho option in Cleveland (doesn't really compare to San Francisco but satisfies my cravings for pho). Service is pretty good and the bowls of noodle soup come out really fast."}
{"text":"Best Pho I have ever had. I get it almost weekly. I highly suggest it to anyone. You will not have a bad meal. I love that for my to go order they gave me the meat raw with the broth in a separate container so I can prepare it properly at home. (You just heat up the broth to boiling and pour it over everything)."}
{"text":"One word comes to mind......amazing! I have only had Pho one other time on east 4th Street and since then I have been skeptical of getting Pho again due to my dislike there. Today however my Pho experience has changed. I went with one of my coworkers who is a Pho fanatic and has been wanting to try Superior Pho. He showed me the proper way to prep the meal with the bean sprouts, basil, and siracha prior to eating it. I ordered the #8 and it was amazing. The broth alone without any additional sauces was perfect. I tasted it before adding any additional sauce. The beef and noodles were perfect. I licked the bowl clean.   TIP: The one thing I could suggest is the check out situation. We were both new customers to.this location and did not know how to proceed with our check. They leave a tiny  piece of paper at the end of your table with a number on it that indicates your check number. Make sure you take this up to the cashier and they will check you out.. we had no idea and had to ask how we paid.  I am so happy I decided to try Pho again. I will forever be a Superior Pho customer.  :)"}
{"text":"I am never going back again to this place. It has no good option for vegetarians. Although they have 4 dishes in the menu for vegetarians including a soup, but it is tasteless. I had ordered vegetarian vermicelli noodles with tofu. I got a big bowl of white cold vermicelli noddles lying at the bottom of the bowl, topped with raw shredded carrots, cucumber, and fried tofu. Everything was completely tasteless. It did not even had salt!! I asked the server to bring some sauce and she came back with fish sauce! Seriously? After asking for some vegetarian option I got some peanut sauce and I asked to heat the bowl for me. Terrible!"}
{"text":"Superior Pho, you're still awesome.  My friends got lost trying to find their way here to meet me on Saturday afternoon, but no matter...because I like that you stay hidden like a secret :)  The only critique I have from this visit was that a chicken salad was brought out to us, and was not what our table had ordered. We had no idea what it was and just presumed it was a side salad since nothing was said about it. Our waiter came by after 15 min and asked us first if we had ordered that salad (we said no) and if we had eaten it (and we said yes). He took it off of our check since we didn't order it, but it was just kind of weird how that mistake was handled.   Otherwise, the pho was delicious as usual and you cannot go wrong with the banh mi EVER."}
{"text":"Man this place is good!  What's almost as nice is it's incredibly cheap!  I would gladly pay a few extra dollars for what you get here (shhh, don't tell them).    The employees are so nice and even when the whole place was packed we had our food in roughly 10 minutes.  That's quick!  I always get the large Pho cause it's like $1 more and it's more than worth it.  The broth is so delicious.  I love everything about Superior Pho.  While the name of the place refers to its proximity to Superior St.. (I think) It definitely is not a misnomer and would more appropriately be used as a description of their service and food."}
{"text":"I actually haven't been to Number 1 Pho next door, but my friends all agree with Mike B's review above: Superior Pho is superior!  I love the Vietnamese Sandwich here. Pork, cilantro, hot peppers, mayo.... and get a small pho to dip it in. Mouth watering. I tried one of the special soups recently, the one that is \"tomato based.\" It turned out not to be as tomato-based as I expected, however. It was still brothy, and it tasted like it had some Sriracha hot sauce added in. Not much different from a large order of a beef+pork pho.  I haven't tried any of the rice dishes yet."}
{"text":"Okay, even though it's good food... I gotta knock it down a star.  Went again tonight with some friends I've met since coming to Cleveland. I chose the combo meal again (mistakenly got the spring roll...so did not want that) and the #12- which was suppose to be all the meats minus the meatballs. I was a tad disappointed with my pho- there was barely any meat! The spring roll....was okay, and they forgot about my iced tea! Service just....was not good. They didn't know which order went with each person, etcera, just kind of annoying.   Plus, they started shutting the blinds at 8:30pm! Who DOES that?! That's so early to close a restaurant....  But I still like the food, nonetheless. I guess it just depends on the time and day for the service....I guess we did have a table of 8..but still! Hrm."}
{"text":"I've been to this maybe like 15-30 times in the past 3 years I have lived in Cleveland. Yummy. In fact, better than the pho I had in Chicago. I always get #12, all the meat except meatballs. Usually small, but sometimes large, depending on how gluttonous I am feeling. The broth is clean, the meat is thinly sliced (I don't like too much meat, but this meat is so thinly sliced and clean that I don't mind if they put too much).   I give them 4 stars instead of 5 because of several reasons: 1) The most recent time I went (this past Sunday), it was during a busy lunch hour. Perhaps the extra amount of customers that they had to attend to (compared to before when I went during times where they only had like 3-4 tables max filled in the restaurant) caused less yummy broth? It just wasn't as savory as I had imagined.  2) A meatball costs $1! The meatballs that I can get for a pack of 12 or so for $3 at Park to Shop. My bf likes #1 large with added meatballs; how they taste, I actually don't know...  The most recent time I went, I ordered a honeydew bubble tea. Bubble tea is something I avoid like the plague in Cleveland, since as far as I know, places around here all use powder instead of the real fruit that I'm used to from Chicago joints. Actually was pleasantly surprised, and the boba was quite delicious. Will have to go back again for the bubble tea. One of these days, I will also go and try the summer rolls and the ban mi."}
{"text":"This was the best pho I've ever had, and I've had pho at least 5 times before this...   OK, so not very impressive coming from me, but I had a great meal here and I think 5 stars are warranted.  The pho I had, the #3, with brisket and eye-round steak, was chock-full of delicious noodles and slices of beef. I made sure to ask for the least-gristly cuts of beef because I've had experiences at other pho restaurants where I was served chunks of pure fat the size of your big toe floating around in my bowl. Blech.  The pho also comes with bean sprouts, mint leaves, jalepenos, and Sriracha sauce on the side, making it highly customizable.  I ordered a combo which also entitled me to a banh mi sandwich, which was very flavorful and served on a surprisingly good baguette.  My only beef with Superior Pho was that it was a little hard to find (you have to enter from a side street south of Superior called Danford Court), and that the bathroom had a plastic bowl full of Palmolive that you dunk your hands into whilst washing them. A dispenser would have been nice, I guess.  All in all, though, I'm glad I came and will be back for more at some point."}
{"text":"This place is affordable and authentic! Their banh mi was very delicious and pho was always super flavorful. Strongly suggest the pho with all kinds of meat in it - that's my favorite. I heard their papaya salad was pretty delicious too!"}
{"text":"Move over, #1; Superior Pho has become the best place to eat pho in Cleveburgh!  Superior Pho's pho is amazing - fresh, savory, delicious soup.  Fantastic for cold winters, or anytime!    There is a parking lot directly behind Superior Pho, as well as lots of street parking on Superior and the side street, and you can enter directly through the back door in the parking lot.    Every time I've been there over the last two years, they've been busy, but they'll find a way to get you in without much of a wait.  Service is friendly and mostly efficient.    Great for takeout, but great to eat here, too!  They recently expanded their dining space, and they now have a nice window and slightly better decor.    We like to check out Superior Pho before going to a show in PlayhouseSquare, or it's even very doable for lunch if you work downtown and can drive your car there easily.    Also, it's cheap!  Most of their dishes are $7-9, and the soup is enough for two meals.  Highly recommended overall!!!"}
{"text":"One would think that the Pho in Ohio would be cheaper but that is a negative.   They have a lot of meal combos so you get a spring/summer roll, Pho of your choice, and a drink for like $14.  I picked the pho with everything in it, fried spring roll (you get one), and the viet iced coffee (this is 2 dollars more on top of the meal price). My meal was basically $17. For some reason I just thought it would be like cheaper... side note: cheapest pho ever that I had was actually in Houston (6 bucks a bowl!)  The broth is decent. The spring roll was like from a Chinese rest- not the authentic viet spring roll that comes with lettuce wrap & dipping sauce. Viet coffee was pretty legit- came with the dripper at all.   FYI: You have to like go through a hallway to get here unless you park in the back. Also-philly pho is still the best!"}
{"text":"Brilliant! Perfectly flavored pho that came as part of a combination special. The size was just right (got the small, which was MORE than enough for even a big appetite). Came with a spring or summer roll and a soda for a little over $10. Well worth it. Helpful service as well."}
{"text":"While this place is quite hard to find, the food is amazing. I brought a group of friends here to try out, some of us have had pho before some had not. The overall rating was a thumbs up! This place is AWSOME \"liquid gold\"."}
{"text":"The food is great but the servers were kind of confused. Come for the food not atmosphere."}
{"text":"I travel quite a bit but can't stand chain restaurants.  Pho makes a good substitute in the sense that it's generally a known quantity.  Every city has a few Vietnamese places and you'll rarely end up with a bad bowl.  But it's not often you end up with that PERFECT bowl.  So when following the advice of fellow Yelpers led me to Superior Pho, I was in for a treat.  Finding the place is fun and a minor adventure, as it's in an umarked passageway past the bathrooms of a soul food place in the front of a non descript building on Superior at 30th.  But when you get there you'll see that it's hardly a secret - the place was packed even in the middle of a Sunday afternoon, mostly with Vietnamese, a sure sign that it's going to be good.  There's dozens of types of Pho.  I ordered one with a couple types of beef.  As another reviewer stated, it's all about the broth in Pho.  And they have nailed it.  It's really perfect.  But this bowl also made me appreciate the beef.  It wasn't fatty scraps, but actually tender pieces.  Nothing cheap about it except the price.  I had a coconut juice side by side and have to say this is probably the best Pho I've had anywhere.  Don't miss the chance to discover it."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese food in Cleveland in my opinion. My friend's and I have been going to Superior Pho for at least the last three years, once every two weeks or a month. At first, we all went to #1 Pho since it had a more noticeable storefront, but this place is by far more bang for your buck.  The broth is really the distinugishing factor for me for pho, & the broth here is amazing, it's savory but light (clear) and you can taste the time that went into making it. The broth at #1 pho is definitely more meaty and oiler in comparison and I can't taste any other ingredients... Another thing, the meat is always sliced way more thinly at Superior Pho which imo makes a big difference.   I've tried a majority of the pho's and the only one I dislike is the beef ball pho. I really recommend #5 which is the tripe & cooked beef (I think the raw beef really changes the flavor of the broth).   Their rice dishes are also really good as well as the chicken cabbage salad and banh mi sandwiches. For the price of a rice dish they really give large portions of meat,  The bubble tea is really a hit or miss, sometime the bubbles are soft and chewy, but sometimes they taste really gross. The bubble teas are all of milky consistency, so if you like green/black tea based bubble tea, it's a no go...  The best part: cheap! and fast, if you order a pho, chances are it'll come to your table in less than 10 minutes usually faster..."}
{"text":"With my interest  and faith in Vietnamese cuisine renewed, my Disitinguished Guest and I headed to the place my fellow Yelpers claimed had the best Pho.  And yeah, wow!  The menu has very clear descriptions, so even a novice, such as myself, can get a good, clear idea of what she's ordering.  There are even combo meals, so that you can try a few things.   The Pho and its component parts tasted very fresh and vibrant.  With the generous bottles of sauce and plates of accompaniments, I could play with it to my heart's content.  Warning-- the \"small\" pho is huge.  I cannot imagine ever being hungry enough to finish a large bowl.    My one disappointment--and only very slightly so--was the summer roll.  It was beautifully fresh, and contained a good number of shrimp, a lot of vermicelli and perhaps only one leaf of basil.  Up the herbal content and I am there.  The iced Vietnamese coffee was a thrill.  Most local places offering Vietnamese or Thai iced coffee bring it to the table pre-mixed.  Here they bring you a glass containing condensed milk with a little french press (?) or some sort of coffee drip device that freshly brews then filters the coffee into your glass.  Once the strong, fresh coffee is filtered, you pour it over ice yourself.  The result is fresher, stronger and better than any I have ever tasted.  Amazing!"}
{"text":"I'm visiting from Cincinnati. My brothers and boyfriend wanted to munch on some Vietnamese food before we headed back. The inside of the restaurant looks a lot better than the outside, I was a little skeptical at first.I ordered the summer rolls and the bun bo hue. The summer rolls were warm filled with noodles,lettuce, mint and 3 shrimp...the peanut butter sauce was probably the best thing from that dish. Now onto the bun bo hue. My goodness... I've never had such a garlic tasting bun bo hue in my life. There's not supposed to have garlic in this dish. The broth tasted nothing like it should..I was disappointed. My brothers and boyfriend got the pho and the broth tasted off as well. Nothing tasted as it should have. I would know.. I'm Vietnamese. I'm not a picky eater by any means but I could not finish my dish at all. Wouldn't recommend to someone who is looking for quality Vietnamese food in the area."}
{"text":"Superman and I stopped in based on the yelp reviews. Although everything was relatively okay, this isn't the place for mind blowing Vietnamese cuisine. The spring and summer rolls were the hum highlight of this meal, sadly. We hail from two cities with denser Vietnamese populations, abounding with hard hitting restaurants that do it better and give ya more. So in summary, this spot is a bit overrated and we hope that  this isn't all ya got bc you deserve better and you should, firstly, love yourself."}
{"text":"A good pho for a cold day, or any day for that matter. They have many different meal combos so I decided to try combo #1, which comes with a choice of a summer or spring roll, a small pho and a drink. The spring roll was pretty fresh and served with a chili/peanut sauce. The broth, which is the most important yet hardest part of making a good pho was pretty delicious. The rare beef and tripe were also pretty yummy.   In addition, the server was nice and although the restaurant could be a little bit cleaner, the food is the most important part of the experience. I would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Perfection.  Bahn Mi's are awesome and their are a few \"off the menu.\" Ask about them.  Get the bubble-tea, Iced-Coffee, a bahn mi and some Pho.  Winter / Comforting Heaven."}
{"text":"How to get to the restaurant: Drive down Superior, turn right after where the alleged street number is, park in the back of the building and enter through the rear. That may save the reader some time and wasted emotion. The pho is good. I had a cold and this was very soothing. The sub was good too. It was confusing to get in the restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm pleased to have discovered this place, the food is excellent as well as the pho, the service is good, parking in the rear is best to enter as there are other restaurants in the building."}
{"text":"It's pho. What's not to like? Their broth tastes fresh and is full of cilantro and other fresh herbs.  The customizations are endless; you can get flank, brisket, and meatballs in one bowl if you damn-well please. It's beautiful.   Besides the pho, they have sandwiches, spring/summer rolls, and bubble tea. I'm a bubble tea snob, and Superior Pho cooks those gooey blobs to a good consistency (which for some reason seems to be an issue in Chinatown,  of all places.) Fantastic food and selection, but come hungry because the portions are huge...I've had leftover pho for two days."}
{"text":"Chibbidy JEAAA  This is my favorite Vietnamese place in Cleveland. Granted, I am not well versed in \"real\" Vietnamese food ... and I have been roundly told by Vietnamese buddies that this place is not authentic. .. however...  You never forget your first banh mi. And I'm lucky I had it here because here it is amazing. Sure, quality may vary from day to day. But when it's right it's the beeest. Crisp, crunchy/soft inside baguette, surprising cilantro and peppers, deliciously different pickled veggies, kick ass meats  = best sandwich ever.  The parents and I prefer this place for the more flavorful, but not too oily broth. They have combo meals, so you can sneak in banh mi and crunchy rolls and a \"small\" (read: plenty) pho all together.   The cabbage and chicken salad isn't as good here as it is next door, and the place is dim with eh decor but hey. That's not why you're going.  Service is always friendly and pretty prompt in my experience.  Pho yes."}
{"text":"This place is the best. I've brought about 10 of my friends here since my first visit. If you are new to pho I recommend getting  a small bowl of the pho ga #13 on the menu in the pho section. Mix a little bit of the plum sauce and siracha in there to start with... Omg so delicious. Also their bubble tea is the slushy kind. Super delicious I almost always get one to go. Wait staff is not the best."}
{"text":"This is my #2 Pho restaurant in Cleveland. The Pho is fantastic here.  The multitude of meat options and sizes insures everyone can find something they like and won't leave hungry.  Prices are on point with other Pho places in Cleveland but a little pricey compared to big cities.  Their summer rolls are amazing, however some come with peanuts inside so be careful when you order.  The Bun options are also fantastic with great portion sizes and awesome flavors.  FYI - if you haven't been here before, there is a back entrance and parking lot off of Superior on Danbury Ct.  Walk through the main doors and it's your first stop on the left with Minh Ahn across from it."}
{"text":"Very good vietnamese food. The summer rolls were my favorite, with a warm peanut dipping sauce. Pho was very good, although I have had better."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. I've been trying lots of Vietnamese places lately and have to mention that I like this place a bit better than Minh Anh. The menu here is smaller, but the portions are just as large and the food is even better! The food tasted so fresh and each flavour in the dish was distinct and powerful. Literally everyone in the restaurant was eating pho except me. I know they are known for pho, but I encourage you to try something else. There other options are good too. I really liked the summer rolls, chicken cabbage salad and the spicy chicken cury on rice. I can't wait to come back and try something else. The pho here looked a bit better than at Minh Anh so I might have to give it another try. The restaurant's decor here is also better than Minh Anh-not brand new, but better. And things are clearly clean - you can see them spraying down the tables between guests. At the moment though the driveway off the side street to the west is literally impassable with potholes. Enter off Superior or the side street to the east."}
{"text":"The Best Pho in the city , no question. I've had in other places and the flavor here is just rich. You feel rejuvenated after eating a Pho from here. Recommended to everyone"}
{"text":"When you say you want Pho in the Cleveland area, Superior Pho is the place to go.  I've eaten pho at just about every Asian restaurant that serves it, and there isn't anyone else that compares.  The portions are great for the price, and the authentic broth can't be found anywhere else.  Eat Superior Pho or BUST.  2nd runner up, Minh Ahn on Detroit Ave. ;-)"}
{"text":"Went to #1 Pho by accident because my husband thought there was no way there was 2 pho places that close together in Cleveland.  Yes way. After ordering at #1 did he tell me we were at the wrong place.  I was steaming!  Had to eat my food there and come over to Superior to get some pho to go because I had to get on the road.  Pho was fantastic, even under difficult circumstances eating in the car. :) Great herbal taste!  The only reason I cannot give it 5 stars is because they gave me cold egg rolls.  Did they they forget or think I wouldn't know because I was taking it to go?  However, I think it was a nice gesture to offer me tea as I waited. :)"}
{"text":"Meh, 3X   Beef pho, chicken pho, bahn mi, chicken cabbage salad.   BF said bahn mi was not good. And that he's had better beef pho.   Chicken pho was extremely bland. Of course had to doctor it up with the sriracha, basil, and sprouts. The broth lacked any depth or substance. Very disappointing. Chicken cabbage salad was sweet and fresh, but the chicken tasted old.   Ordered iced tea on the side, it came at the end of the meal...warm.   Service was erratic. Food was SO damn disappointing. After reading all the great reviews...wtf."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this restaurant for years and the quality has not changed. Best Pho I've ever had. Amazing on a cold winter day or if you are sick. I always get the large vegetable one and the Bo bia rice paper roll appetizer. They bring a plant of aromatics like basil, jalapeño, and lime, etc to put in your soup. The bo bia is a rice paper roll with lettuce, mint, scrambled eggs, a bacon and maybe daikon or something similar. Service is always very fast and the place has expanded over the years."}
{"text":"I liked it. I had to live in Tampa where Pho is notoriously bad, so when I took a trip out here I was having a Pho dry spell. It was like heaven eating good pho again. Other than that it is a typical Pho joint, you smell like beef broth when you leave. There are giant pot holes."}
{"text":"I think Superior Pho might be the best Vietnamese restaurant in this area, but it's definitely not the best I had. Most pho dishes they have are good, except for Bun bo Hue. I generally will order No.7, which is with the clear, non-spicy broth. However, I noticed that they also have Bun bo Hue in our last visit, and this is one of my favorite so I gave it a try.  I was so disappointed. The broth tastes really odd and the ingredients are not right. I would not recommend this to anyone. The grilled pork rice is ok, for me, the pork is ok but the rice is a bit too hard to chew. The iced coffee is a must with our every visit."}
{"text":"I've been here before... as has everyone in Cleveland in search of the perfect pho.  I held off on reviewing until I came back on a few different occasions.  This review will really be an average of my visits to the location.  If you're searching for the best pho in town, my vote goes elsewhere.  But the pho alone could have gotten a 4* review.  The most consistent flaw with this place is the service (or the lack there of).  Every time I'm here they mess up the order and bring me the wrong food, they told my bf they have thai iced tea and brought out regular iced tea, they forgot my vietnamese coffee order, but eventually after several corrections, the right food came out, and the drinks they don't have were finally taken off the bill.  So how's the food?  I always get pho at pho restaurants -- it's good, but not amazing.  Their meat portion is much smaller than other places, but you can pay more money to get double meat if you want.  The broth is inconsistent.  It's been pretty good at times, and horribly off at other times.  They insist on serving pho with lemon, and maybe some people like it that way.  But I've always had pho with lime, and it's just not the same.  The bean sprouts are sometimes wilted and kind of poor quality... so sometimes I have to pick through my plate.  The noodles are often clumped and stuck together.  I know that all pho restaurants pre-cook noodles and keep them in single-serve sized bundles.. but it just doesn't come out with a ball of noodles all congealed together at other places.  It's fine.. it's pho.. it's usually pretty good pho.  But it's disappointing given how good the review were, and I seriously think there are better ones in town.  I will continue to go to Superior when my favorite place is closed, because it's good enough satisfy the pho craving and probably my 2nd choice in town.  ----------------------------------- Explanation of my rating system - 5*: Epitome of something, the best I've had, would LOVE to go back 4*: Great food and happy to go back regularly, but not the best of the category 3*: Food is fine.  I may spontaneously decide to go there based on convenience.  But no need to go back either. 2*: If you insist, I guess I'll come along. I'll find something to eat. But I wouldn't have picked it. 1*: No plans to come back.  I'll try to talk companions out of going."}
{"text":"Love the Chicken Pho. Great flavor. Best I've had in this area. Lets put it this way if I could - I'd order this everyday! I  usually order and pick up... on a cold Saturday this place is packed."}
{"text":"Been going to Number One Pho for years. A number of my friends told me Superior Pho is superior (pun intended) to Number One Pho. I just don't see it. The Goi Cuon (my favorite) shrimp, pork, rice vermicelli, fresh lettuce, and bean sprouts rolled in rice paper served with dipping sauce is far better at Number One Pho not to mention cheaper. The peanut sauce at Superior Pho had a watery consistency with next to no peanuts. The one at Number One Pho was thick, rich, and loaded with crushed peanuts and the rolls were bigger.  I wouldn't say Number One Pho has a lot of ambiance but it is certainly better than Superior Pho. If I was from out of town I would have second thoughts about even walking in Superior Pho. As far as service is concerned I would say both are the same. Fast and efficient."}
{"text":"I've been going to Superior Pho since i moved to Cleveland in 2008, and I think I can confidently say it's my favorite place to eat in the city. Delicious, unpretentious food in a casual environment. It's my go-to for lunch any day, but I will especially wake up with intense cravings for a #2 and bahn mi after a night of heavy drinking. The #2 is my favorite variety of pho on the menu, because I can ask for the meat on the side and cook it in the broth as I go (what can i say, i love raw/rare meat). I know some may be put off by the speedy but sparse service, but I'm totally okay with it. My order is taken within a minute of sitting down, and less than five minutes later, I've got a big, steaming bowl of pho in front of me, and a huge smile on my face. If i need anything extra, I'll just flag down a server, no big deal. The owner almost always stops by my table to say hi and ask how everything is, and to thank me for coming in. That kind of friendliness makes up for any perceived shortcomings in the regular service.   I have no end to the nice things I could say about Superior Pho. Don't hesitate, just go. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Superior Pho is not so superior at all. I am honestly shocked by all the great reviews here on yelp. I have had many Pho bowls in my time and to me ranks below average.  Bad Location - Tucked all the way behind warehouse like building with no visual signs in front.  The Pho -  large bowl size is quite small for the price you can get at other places. broth is pretty bland (this is what makes or breaks your pho). They did manage to get beef brisket right which is +1 star. Another +1 star since it was not the worst pho i've ever had.  Verdict - price is too overpriced for my taste... even a 12 oz soda can cost more than what my hotel charged which is pretty sad lol!"}
{"text":"Superior Pho provides a product so unique and delicious, I am willing to drive 40 minutes one way just to enjoy a large #1 bowl of pho.  I have been coming to this restaurant for many years, and the quality has never once suffered in any way.  Everyone that I have exposed Superior Pho to has the same reaction..THIS IS DELICIOUS!  I have not really tried any of the other offerings that they have, as I do not think they can create anything better than my usual.  Those looking for a fancy restaurant or affluent part of town will be disappointed, as it sits in a pretty out dated and dumpy looking area, but you should never judge a book by its cover!  I recommend everyone within an hours drive from this restaurant to grab a couple friends and enjoy some pho together."}
{"text":"I am not from Cleveland, so I think this place is a bit sketchy. But man, the Pho is probably the best I have ever had in the midwest. Nothing close to Pho ban in NYC, but still very good."}
{"text":"The hype is all true: Superior Pho is the place to be! A couple of times per month, my husband and I drop in for a quick dinner or Friday-night take-out and it's consistently delightful. Everything is fresh, homemade, full of flavor, and so affordable! Our perennial favorites are the Summer Rolls (4A), Noodle Salad (1B), Brisket Pho, Bahn Mi, and Curried Beef with Broken Rice. Whatever you choose, though, you simply can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Definitely the best pho spot in the area. I went here twice after trying other Vietnamese restaurants. Their pho is really good and uses fresh noodles. The bun bo hue was amazing."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb.com. I discovered this little gem recently while coming back from downtown and was beside myself with delight. The fact that they have both bubble tea (Mango is my favorite) and also Banh mi sandwiches under one roof--add in the fantastic and spicy pho--made me giddy. My friend ordered a combo meal (number 5 to be exact) and the portion was so huge.   Do not expect this to be super fancy or anything, as it is not. What it is however, is tremendously good Vietnamese food that you can carefully curate to make it your own. It is really great. The place is super causal and quick with service. Located in an easy to access area and worth the trip any day."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious Vietnamese restaurant located in Cleveland. I really liked the pho dac biet that I got here and would say that it's the best in Cleveland that I've had. I have also gotten the banh mi which is also amazing."}
{"text":"Best place to get Pho in Cleveland.  Their broth is amazing. Lunch can get busy so get there early."}
{"text":"Good food . Price is reasonable. Location is kind of sketchy. Good service."}
{"text":"We were visiting my aunt here in Cleveland and decided to see if there were any good places to eat pho. Based on the reviews, we decided to check this place out. We almost went to Number One Pho but finally found Superior Pho.  I ordered the combination - fresh spring roll, house pho, and a drink (Coke). My roommate got the other combination with the house pho, sandwich, and drink (vietnamese drip coffee with condensed milk).   Pretty standard on the spring roll, it tastes like any other spring roll you get from other pho shops. The vienamese coffee was up to standards and was pretty fresh.  My roommate and I both agreed that the house pho (surprisingly) ranks up there with our standards. First off, they didn't skimp on any of the meats or the noodles! The meats were tender and tasty, the noodles were a lot for a small, and the broth tasted like it's been brewing all day which was very yummy.  The only reason why we gave this place a 4 star was because the sandwich that came with the combination was pretty dry but they made up for it later when we ordered stuff to go.   We ordered the house sandwich to go and the lemon grass pork with rice. When I checked the lemon grass pork with rice it had peanuts on it and my son is allergic to peanuts. I asked the waitress if we could get another order and I'd pay for the one I already ordered but she insisted that it was quite alright and understandable and made a fresh order with no peanuts and didn't charge me.   Very friendly staff! Definitely coming back when we're in town again!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE superior pho. Used to work right by this place and I went all the time. I'll put their Pho and Banh Mi up against any expensive restaurant in the city. Do yourself a favor and go here!"}
{"text":"Soup, Salad, Banhwich to go.  (uh-oh....)  Thanks to most of the reviewers who put me into the \"can't wait to taste that stuff\" zone, I finally made it here.  It all began with a friendly, helpful girl who took my order.  I told her that it was my first time there, that I'd never eaten Vietnamese foods, and that I was really looking forward to trying these dishes. .  COMBINATION MEAL 2    GOI GA  * * * * *  Chicken Cabbage salad; deliciously vinegary-sweet thin (like water) dressing over very finely-shredded cabbage, with cilantro additions resulting in that herb as the dominant flavor.   A few small pieces of mild tender chicken breast complemented the pleasant crunchy sharpness.   #3 PHO TAI CHIN  * * *    Well-done Brisket and raw Eye of Round Steak, both shaved and in very generous amounts (but with too much fat and gristle that I had to trim off the dry, lacking-in-flavor Brisket), lots of crunchy bean sprouts, a few slices of onion and mild green pepper, many leafy sprigs of I'm-not-sure-what-but-tasted-wonderful (probably a form of basil), and a little tub of a hot saucy mixture---maybe a sesame/hoisin mix---but alas, no noodles.  Their site says Pho contains noodles.  Looked forward to that, but still satisfying without.  Obvious---but mild---cinnamon-flavored broth, that once other ingredients are added as you eat, begins taking on the beef and herb flavors.  I wouldn't mind a big pot of this type of broth---to dip a ladle into over 2 or 3 days---with all those delicious additions.  I'm going to do a little kitchen experimentation.  I have a wonderful beef broth recipe that might soon be going through a little Asian Transformation.  (Hmm---TransformAsian.  Just made that up, but it's probably been floating through the universe for decades.)   And I won't forget the noodles.  (FYI:  For newies like me, PHO is pronounced FUH, as in DUH.  Searched it a year ago, and it's taken me this long to visit a Pho spot.)   CHOICE OF BEVERAGE  *   Jasmine iced tea was way too weak---delicious but too faint a flavor---and as close to plain water as you can get.  Needed another 5 minutes steeping or more tea to water ratio. .  The \"7C\" style, BANH MI THIT  * *    Good crusty French Bread hoagie-style, with roasted pork, cucumber, homemade pate, mayonnaise sauce, and fresh herbs---maybe daikon, too.  Very little pork, however---looking nothing at all like the photo on their site showing a good amount of meat.  Mine had a very light-handed fill, and almost as much fat as pork---thinly-sliced into long narrow strips.  (Fat was never mentioned as one of the ingredients on their menu description, but there sure was enough of it.)  Since this was my first ever banh mi, I don't know if this is the authentic way that it's prepared and served, but was willing to try as is.  \"When in Rome\" lasted about 2 bites before I performed the final trimming----and ended up with a reasonably-sized pile of fat, at that.  It was a disappointment---not enough flavor or ingredients, and not enough of the good parts.  Plus, the two very faint smears of pate and mayonnaise lent no discernible flavor to this sandwich.   I'd read about Banh Mi's years ago, so at least I was able to finally try one.  Really liked the idea---the combination of these elements.  With this visit, I've found another new way to use my leftover roasted pork---I'll just add these other ingredients and make my own.  Done.   . I want to believe that I was noodle-deprived and pork/pate short-changed by accident.  I'll just about always give the benefit of the doubt in matters like this, although it was a slow (from all appearances) Sunday afternoon and was nearly empty---counted only 5 diner-heads.  Mondays they're closed.  Maybe they'd run out of prepared ingredients---namely noodles, pork, and pate---but I don't want to go there.  Even the best laid plans....   If I ever go back---I'm still deliberating on that possibility---I'll eat in.  Or I might try other Vietnamese spots to compare these dishes and confirm authenticity.   Now, it could be my inter-galactic experience manuevering through swirling space debris, dwarfs, and all that other stuff, but I had no problem finding this joint.  I pulled right in like I was pulling into my own driveway.  I took the interbelt north, turned off and up the Superior exit ramp, made a sharp right turn halfway up, came to a stop sign, crossed a side street, continued straight onto an open alleyway, and there was the building's rear entrance at my left.  Appeared to have parking for 20-30 cars---for at least the two restaurants here, and perhaps other businesses, too.  Click on the Google map on Yelps Superior Pho's page, choose Satellite view and click + and -- to get a feel for where it's located.  My recommendation:   Pull up their site for complete menu and descriptions so you know what to expect. http://www.superiorpho.com Eat in rather than taking out---if there's an omission, it's easily resolved."}
{"text":"Great pho, good price.  Interior could be nicer, hours could be better, but service is generally fast, staff is always friendly, and the food is amazing.  Little is better in my book than a modestly priced bowl of superb pho with tea.  Easily one of the best eateries in Cleveland area, don't pass up superior pho if in the area."}
{"text":"The best pho in town!!! If you're in Cleveland you must go by for lunch. It's perfect for the cold weather. Pho tai and banh mi are amazing. They are busy but do an excellent job getting people seated. The management and service is impeccable and matches their food. Go now!"}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times before in the past, and it was very mediocre but today service was pathetic. I arrived with 3 other girls for a quick bite before a concert and we knew that they had good food. We were seated almost immediately and then our orders were taken fairly quickly (4 phos and 4 bubble teas, and they were out of boba at that point and would be made with some pomegranate thing, which was fine). That's when everything slowed to a stop. We didn't get any water until after we had been there for just over half an hour, then we think they forgot about us. It wasn't until one of the girls I was with stared down our waiter that he brought out our food. I dislike cilantro and made sure to tell out server that I'd like mine without cilantro, but of course it came out full of cilantro, and it wouldn't have worth it.  At this point we still haven't received our bubble tea. Two of them were brought and and were nothing but ice and the popping pomegranate things. Then about 10 minutes later another bubble tea was brought out, and mine still wasn't out. We had to ask our server if my bubble tea was ready and said that \"it was being made\". Ten minutes later he came out and asked what kind I had. My tea was brought out with raw boba in it but by that point I just wanted to leave. Not a good experience whatsoever, not sure if I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great pho and bahn mi.. their combo options are great!"}
{"text":"I have been a long time customer (over 10 years) and referred a friend to eat there. However, I am extremely disappointed at how the OWNER treated their experience and I will not go back. This is what she said:  DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!! It was my first time here and I will not come back. The restaurant was dirty, the waitress picked up a dropped spoon and set it on another table. It smelled like old fish and some unknown odor. The waitresses look depressed and utterly unsatisfied. I ordered chicken fried rice and the chicken was very dry. I was a hospitality major and had to take a cooking class. No, I do not claim to be a first class chef, but I know over cooked chicken breast when I see it. I have even cooked it myself. This was over cooked. It was fried and then pulled and then fried again. I was taken here by my native Vietnamese friend and she said the food was horrible. Her soup was warm and had to be reheated. The waitress brought out some fish sauce for the rice and my friend said that it will only make it salty not moist. When our waitress took the plate back a third time the owner returned instead. He was very rude to us. We tried to ask how the chicken was cooked and he said that it was fried then refried with the rice. We asked if we could have something else and he said \"No, you get nothing else.\" He also said that we are causing too much trouble and that we were giving him trouble and if he had ten customers like us he would be out of business. He waved his finger in her face and said \"do not come back\". She did not yell back, just said \"ok that's fine\", and we left."}
{"text":"We were so skeptical of actually being able to find decent pho since we are so spoiled in California but we were pleasantly surprised at how great this place is! It is hard to find and not off the main street - it is not the fancy looking empty pho place on the street front corner. You have to go inside the plaza with the red awning and pass the Taiwanese place and Korean place to the back. Or you can do what we did and walk past the building to the corner cafe and call and have the girl tell you its 'right there.' We ended up walking to the back, through another parking lot and found it - oh so it is 'right there.' Duh. You go in the building and then the place has its own entrance inside - picture a glass enclosed store inside a shell building. Upon entering you see a diverse crowd and diverse staff - diverse meaning non viet staff. The place was packed! Perhaps due to the drizzle outside or perhaps due to the yumminess this place dishes out? Both. As we waited for a table, 5 mins, we looked around and saw that their drink display cases had 'Pho Hoa' on it which was interesting and reassuring and then the biggest reassurance- a viet mom peeking out from the back. Ok if she's back there cooking - we have a winner! Our table ordered a couple of chicken pho, a tofu rice dish, and my gf and I shared a pho dac biet and an order of Bo bia - the last thing we expected to see in the menu. Everything was great, flavor profiles were well balanced and hit the spot. The only thing that was a miss from our party was the tofu dish - they serve it with fish sauce so our vegan friend said it was not that well seasoned without the sauce. Also note, no vegan pho here."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite places to eat in Cleveland! They serve honestly amazing pho that come with all the traditional fixings. I love the #12 pho with all the meats, especially when dipped in sriracha. The broth is light but comforting, which is much needed during the cold winter days. Pho also makes the most phenomenal hangover meal or cure for a cold. Definitely a meal that doesn't leave you feeling gross afterwards.   The portions are large and satisfying without breaking the bank. Service is quick and friendly. Parking is available, but the RTA can also take you here. I can't say enough good things about this place."}
{"text":"this is the best place to get pho in Cleveland, hands down. all of the sides are awesome, too. Their bahn mi is by far the best i've ever had.  for around $12, you walk out of there full and happy.  for something good, try grilled marinated pork in your pho. its sweet and smokey. mmmm."}
{"text":"Just horrible! I believe my cousin now when they say Vietnamese people don't eat out at Vietnamese restaurant in Ohio (and no it's not because they can cook it at home)... The quality of food here is just down right unacceptable as well as their service.  I'm just going to be straight forward:  Service:  Waitress or \"cashier\" sat us down. Didn't ask if we needed a high chair for our toddler and no water.   A group came in after us and immediately got water and got their orders taken.  (At this point I'm still holding my child... no one bother to look at us)  I just decided to carry my child over to the high chairs and carry it over myself while holding my child on one side... AND STILL not one waitstaff bother to look at us or come over to us. Eventually I had to wave one waiter down, he just look confused and went back to the kitchen to get us water.   I had to wave another wait staff down to place and order. My husband accidentally knock over the water. The waiter took our orders and told us that he will be right back to clean the mess up... (the mess was NEVER clean... and when i said never I mean, we pay and the ice was still on the table *see picture for reference*)  There were different waiters coming to our table to drop our food and FAIL to see or bother to clean the mess that's on the table.   Over all the whole wait staff needs to be retrain...   Food:  Papaya Salad: tasteless... in Vietnamese it's advertise as \"Kho Bo\" meaning \"beef jerky\", but we got pork jerky... the sauce was just plain soy sauce.   Pho: bland... I normally don't add hoisin sauce or hot sauce. But I had to this time and almost a tablespoon of fish sauce and it was still bland...  I just felt the need to write this because I'm highly disappointed that this place have raving reviews and this is nothing like authentic Vietnamese cuisine. If you think this is great, wait until you have the real deal in places that have a good amount of Viet community, your mind will be blown!   You are better off investing in a 8 quart instant pot and follow \"Cong can cook pho\" on YouTube...."}
{"text":"Yaaaass! Delicious soup that made me phoget all my problems. The broth was so perfectly balanced with seasoning, I wasn't even tempted to add sriracha or any other sauce to it! I already can't wait to come back. Pho real. Phocking phonomenal! Spring rolls were bomb, too!"}
{"text":"so for the past like, two years I've been thinking that I've been going to superior pho but really I've been going next door to #1 Pho (also good!). I finally ended up here thanks to a friend who led me through the (slightly strange) vietnamese mini mall that houses this hole-in-the-wall pho joint.  Honestly I don't know how anyone ever figured out that this place existed.  Anyway, I'm glad that I ended up there, finally. The pho is good and the prices are really good (especially by broke college student standards). And the summer rolls! not usually that into cold shrimp dishes, but they were yummy."}
{"text":"Everyone loves this place but I can't say the same unfortunately. My heart belongs to another Pho restaurant. Ordered pho with a meat array minus the beef balls. I thought the broth was a little thin and required a lot of doctoring (added a lot of fish sauce, sriracha and lime). I'm watching my carbs so we got these yam noodles (can be bought at any Asian market which has no carbs), we brought in 5 packets of these and they were very kind to use those instead of the regular pho noodles. Large bowl was $8.95, came with the expected garnishes of jalapeno, limes, bean sprout, basal. Fish sauce is already on the table, loved that!  I thought the service was excellent. Parking was easily accessible right behind the venue (and free!). I would like to return to try some of their other entrees though."}
{"text":"Best pho in Cleveland, no contest. Service is always on point- I absolutely love coming here for a quick work lunch because I know I won't have to wait long before a steaming bowl of noodle soup is set before me. Yes the outside looks dodgey, but that shouldn't stop you from trying this hidden gem of an eatery."}
