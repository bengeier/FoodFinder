{"text":"Food:  Excellent udon. Hand made with traditional Japanese technique. Rare to find in North America! All the styles are tasty and are prepared with prefect technique. The sashimi selection is also quite good considering it's not their specialty.  Price: Lunch and dinner combos are a bit pricier than most lunch joints. That said, it's literally a 4 course meal. If you're not full after, you're either a fat slob or you have tapeworms. Do yourself a favour and spend 5 dollars more on lunch and get a superior quality of food than burgers or a salad and sandwich combo.  Service:  This dj where they fall down. Wait staff is attentive but overall access to the resto is ineffective. They open at 11:30 and close by 2:30 and reopen at 6:30. That's dumb. Open at 11 and don't close throughout the day. Even if business is slow, St. Claire has enough commute that they are bound to drag in customers. I've been there about 10 times now at 11 hoping to eat and they are closed still or arrive at 3:30 to be told they need a break. In this day and age, especially in a busy city like Toronto, that kind of rest isn't tolerated much anymore..."}
{"text":"Udon is fantastic, not too chewy, not too soft! It's prefect, by far the best udon noodles I've had since Nami. I tried the curry and the regular pork udon and both were great, pretty decent portion. Me and my partner got the dinner course menu and the menu isnt as clear as it should be. The grilled portion of the appetizer is fish, so if you don't eat fish, let them know beforehand, they were nice enough to take the salmon back and substitute it with pork for me.  Their spicy tuna roll is also great! Not the usual ones you eat at every other sushi bar, theirs is very different...but still tastes fantastic. Also their sashimi is pretty fresh too.  Definitely give this place a try if you like udon!"}
{"text":"The udon was amazing, the texture was perfect. The broth on the over hand was just average, I had the curry broth and my husband had the combination of the different broths to dip. The portion was a good size not like some other noddle places. We also had the grilled cod which was pretty good. I would come back if I was in the area and wanted to eat udon noodles but would not make a specific trip back."}
{"text":"Hubby and I took the subway to get to Bushi last night. It was recommended by a friend of mine after I told her about the awesome udon place I went to in Hawaii (Marukame on Honolulu - as good as the ones in Japan - it's a chain from there).   Excited to have hand-made udon again, we ventured out to Bushi. Arrived around 7pm. Only one other table there.  Two other tables came in while we were eating.   The place was cute. Quiet. Service friendly - just one chef and one server.   I ordered the pork in hot broth. Husband ordered the tempura mixed-veggie zaru style. We also ordered the grilled tongue.   The grilled tongue came first. It was yummy. 5-6 pieces for $10.50. A bit pricey for my liking. But it was done very well.   Then the zaru udon came. The udon was a bit on the hard side. A bit undercooked - so it felt like eating a stick of dough. The sauce was very good though. And the tempura had a great mix of veggies. Well worth the $10.50.   Mine came next. Because my udon was in hot broth, I could cook my stiff udon a bit longer. It was definitely better texture after a few minutes. There was a lot of pork but it tasted really bland. The wakame & shaved leeks were a nice touch. But I wish I paid an extra $1 to have it musashino style. That looked interesting. :) I didn't feel mine was worth the $9.50.   Although tempted to order sashimi, sushi, grilled octopus, and other dishes - it was starting to look pricey for two people. Our bill was just under $40 including tax and tips. We might try some of the other dishes if we go back.   ----End of Review----  Tip for making great udon at home:  I like my $2-3 package of 5 frozen udon pieces from T & T supermarket imported from Japan (if you are ever craving udon, these are top notch udon - don't buy the ones that are not frozen).  Complete with a tub of miso paste also from Japan - not the Korean one (these can go a long way - check fridge aisle and not the individually packaged serving size in boxed aisle) and good quality crab sticks imported again from Japan (the $7.99 ones - you'll never buy other ones after this), anyone can make a great bowl of udon. If you're crazy in love with authentic taste, like my husband, you can buy a box of dashi and sprinkle some into the miso soup. Oh, and while you're at it, chop up some napa cabbage while boiling the broth. It usually takes me 15 mins in total to prep & cook. It's delicious.   But I'm still on the look out for good hand-made udon in Toronto."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my nabeyaki udon, particularly the noodles. Also tried some sushi which was only ok."}
{"text":"If you want authentic hand made Sanuki Udon (wheat flour noodle) without flying to Japan? This is it. While Udon might not caught on quite like sushi or ramen have in North American's food consciousness, it's about time it makes an appearance. Bushi Udon Kappo illuminates the reason why Udon is such an obsession in Japanese food culture; they even made a movie on Udon! People go on Udon vacations in search of and lined up all day for the perfect noodle, crazy, huh?  I tried the house special Pork and Onion Udon, it was so good. The hot broth was deep in flavor from hours of simmering and it warms up your soul! The slightly cooled Udon is dipped in a very hot broth, to allow for the noodle to come up to temperature without losing its al dente quality.  Each strand of Udon was coated with porky deliciousness, it was just heavenly! The price was also reasonable and it was more filling than that of the recently opened Hokkaido ramen house.    I also tried the chef special fried eggplant, the taste was really authentic (the grated daikon and ginger on top of the dish is a dead give away as to where the chef is from, ). However for $6.90, this appetizer scored a little low on the value side, consider you only get about 6 or 7 tiny pieces. Authentic Japanese portion and authentic Japanese pricing. Overall, the whole experience was great enough to warrant a return visit.   Went back again for the second night, this time the mixed veggie tempura (kakiage) Udon for $9.50 ( see picture) along with two extra pieces of shrimp ($2 @)and eggplant ($1.5@). The broth (dashi) was slightly different than the pork and onion variety, it was clear and lighter with a subtle aroma of Benito. The Udon is served in the broth rather than on the side. The tempura is served separately and it has only a whisper of coating on them, it was light and crispy; every bit as good as the tempura in Japan.   Just remember it's ok to slurp loudly if you enjoy the Udon, so go make some noise!!"}
{"text":"I came here a few months ago and it seems like their popularity has grown (rightfully so). As many have already mentioned, this places serves authentic handmade udon, and it is freaking delicious. The texture is perfect - just the right mix of chewiness.   I stopped ordering udon from usual sushi restaurants since most of the time it is quite mediocre, and you can easily buy decent quality fresh/frozen udon from any Asian supermarket and make your own, so if you're going to go out and pay good money for udon, please do so.  The $25 dinner udon combo is technically pricey for noodles, but it comes with some tasty apps. Also, don't forget to try the dessert udon (having ignorantly only eaten salty udon, I was skeptical, but this was really good)"}
{"text":"I want to say 3.6 stars vs. 3 or 4 and here's why.  Udon made in house--awesome. Broth that comes with it--kind of underdeveloped. Quality of fish--quite good compared to other places. Meals prepared with some care and portions are generous. Some of the appetizers were good.   However, they were presented a little unceremoniously on the table, as in, the person who was not our original server just came up and a little abruptly dropped it off at the table while I was talking with my date. Atmosphere is quite casual.  If they master the broth and the atmosphere, they could easily upgrade to another star in my book."}
{"text":"Because I'm on a ketogenic diet, I went with the ceviche of the day. I was so impressed with the quality of the fish, I didn't mind paying a bit extra compare to all the other places. For a lack of better description, the ceviche tasted super fresh with hint of flower. I know it sounds odd, but it was amazing. This is definitely not a place to get full on a budget, but my palate was very happy :)"}
{"text":"1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent  Food: 3.5 Service: 3 Ambiance: 3 Overall: 3  Extra information:  * Open for lunch and dinner * Vegetarian option avail * Pay parking across the street * Lunch special * Takes reservation  Ordered: Grilled Rice Ball 5/5  Brushed with soy sauce, $2 for 1 piece. This is good to order if you want some extra carbs on top of your main dish. It is grilled so that outside is crispy but inside is still soft.  Ordered: Tsuke 4/5  Cold udon served with soy sauce based bonito flavor hot soup for dipping, Musashino style for $10.50. You get to choose between Pork soup or Mushroom soup. Or you can make this a Udon combo which comes with house salad, 2 appetixers and a roll for $15.50. Udon combo is good to order if you are hungry, although appetizers are small, with rolls and salad it will def fill you up. Salad was decent and the rolls were all vegetarian except one with tuna. This was my first time trying Musashino style udon and you eat it like Cold Soba. Take a bit of udon, dip it in the soup and it's good to eat. Since the udon noodles come cold, you need to keep it in the soup for a bit before it warms up. Near the end, the soup did get a little too salty for me so I chose to dip the udon instead of letting it sit in the soup. Udon noodles are made fresh in house and they were probably one of the best ones I've tasted. They were chewy, bouncy and cooked perfectly! This is a must try if you love noodles.    Ordered: Kake 3/5  Hot bowl of Udon in curry for $10.50. House made udon noodles in Japanese curry. I found the curry to be really thick, little too salty as well. This is something I tried in Hawaii and it would be good with some rice since it is rich.  Ordered: Chicken Karaage & Shrimp Tempura 2/5  This was ordered as extra topping for $2 each. I didn't really like their chicken karaage, it was soggy in texture and served cold. Even though it is $2 per order, I didn't think it was worth it.  Ordered: Nabeyaki Udon 3.5  Hot pot udon cooked in metal pot topped with shrimp tempura, chicken karaage, deep fried tofu, mushrooms and egg for $13.50. We ordered this with tempura on side since nobody enjoys soggy tempura. The soup was kind of bland but udon noodles made up for it and it is a perfect dish to have on a cold day.  Summary: Now that Toronto is filled with ramen restaurants, maybe it's time for udon! This is first of very few restaurants that specialize in udon noodles and customers can enjoy them in different soups/sauces to your liking. Even if you don't like udon, they offer many other Japanese dishes that are reasonable in price. If you are in the area, def drop to check them out!"}
{"text":"I was struggling a bit with this one.  3.5 stars?  The udon was delicious, don't get me wrong.  Perfect texture.  Curry sauce was flavourful and the dipping broth was really tasty.  But if you think about it, does this place have any competition?  It's the only restaurant in Toronto with this magical udon-making machine!  I wish I had somewhere to compare it to.  Japan and Hawaii don't count.  I like hot towels so I can wipe my hands before I eat.  However, I think they should be handed to each person with tongs if they are unwrapped, or the diners can unwrap the plastic themselves.  I didn't like that the towels were unwrapped and just passed, hand to hand.  Seems to defeat the purpose of cleanliness and hygiene.  The servers were very friendly, but seemed to be somewhat overwhelmed as it was a packed house and there was a line out the door."}
{"text":"Not great, don't have gyoza or tempura. Spicy tuna was terrible, spicy salmon was decent."}
{"text":"I had the seafood udon and it was delicious. The udon has a slight sweet taste to it and the broth was tasty.  The seafood was also sweet tasting. It also came with a few rice cakes.  The bowl was enough to fill me, and for $14, I thought it was reasonably priced.  They also have lunch specials. My friend ordered the spicy curry. It was rich and creamy, and the portion size is pretty good.   This is a cute little place to go to for lunch. Small, but I think it's very cozy. The server was really great and the service was fairly quick.   The reason I didn't give 5/5 is because I've yet to try other food on the menu. I would definitely come here for udon though - you can tell it's \"home made\" and fresh.  I would definitely come back here to try other food items on the menu. It's a great place, definitely a must try."}
{"text":"Generous Udon portion sizes Delicious broth Very friendly service Cozy atmosphere - interesting music choices The brewed rice green tea is delicious"}
{"text":"The udon lunch set is very good... I can't finish everything. The broth is tasty but not oily or salty! Very authentic! Even though the food is yummy, but it seems like they are a lil bit short on staff.. Only one waitress during lunch hour."}
{"text":"Only had the udon selections but it was very delicious !   The almond jelly with fruits is a must try!"}
{"text":"Got the curry udon and it was very fresh and flavourful. Tasted like the curry you would get in japan. Other reviewers seems to think the non curry flavour is not as developed, but I'd still like to try it next time. The salad dressing was good. Didn't get a chance to try other appetizers so will come back for sure next time!"}
{"text":"+.5 for service  I felt there was something missing in my visit. I really wanted to love this restaurant because it's something unique and I really love udon noodles in general. However I simply can't give this place 4 stars.  I wanted something different from udon noodle soup as that is very common everywhere. I decided to have the tsuke udon with mushroom soup in the lunch menu. I expected the mushroom soup to be boiling hot, but unfortunately it was just between lukewarm and bearable hot. This made the first half of the udon (which by the way I really liked) very delicious, but the second half kinda tough to eat due to the fact the udon was too chewy from the cool to lukewarm soup. I kinda wished the soup bowl was a little bigger, as that would really help with pulling more noodles into the bowl of soup.  Service was great though, and the chef seems to know half the customers when I was there. They also sell the handmade udon used in the udon meals for customers to boil at home, so if you enjoy the udon here and want some to take home, that is entirely possible.  In terms of me coming back though? Meh, given the cost it would have to be some sort of event..."}
{"text":"Returned after three months because I was forced to (my mother doesn't ever take 'no' for an answer). This place continues to serve really underwhelming food; not sure if they cheap out on ingredients or the staff here don't know how to cook. The broth for the udon is literally light brown water and the tendon was equally bland.   If you want udon or any donburi, skip this place and come to my house.  Good for: not sure, definitely not for a meal"}
{"text":"This place is friggin fantastic.    I need to address something quite shocking.  I personally hate udon noodles. Whenever I go to any Japanese restaurant, it's EXTREMELY rare that I'll end up getting udon.  If I'm in the mood of Japanese noodles, I normally default to either soba or ramen noodles and go to their respective specialty stores.  Udon noodles for me have been too thick, too hard and the texture has never been my favourite.  Most of the Japanese places that I've been, never been hand-made, primarily store bought and I just never fully enjoy them.  Up....until now.  My lil niece suggested this places and was constantly talking about \"dessert noodles\" (Udon Kinako) and I was eager to try them (since udon noodles I've had have always been entree like) - I'll discuss more about the dessert noodles down below.  So I ordered \"L4\" which is a set course that contains Curry Udon with Beef, which comes along an appetizer of sashimi, grilled fish (I forgot what fish it was) and tempura shrimp/vegetables. All these set meals (there are 5 of them) are priced at $25 which is a tad expensive for udon but honestly it's definitely worth it.    As for the tempura, I can't review the shrimp one because my niece and nephew ate them all but judging their faces I can only imagine that they were fried to perfection.  The vegetables were really good, put two of my favourite veggies (Yam and Zucchini).   The grilled fish (sadly I don't know what it was), was a fatty kind of fish with a thousand island-ish dressing.  Add on the lemon and you have the acid from the lemon cutting through the fattiness of the fish and the sweetness of dressing.  It's a myriad of different flavour notes that makes the fish really sing.  And finally the sashimi...SO good.  High quality fish and tempered at the right temperature.  I'm seeing some reviews stating that the sashimi isn't so great and honestly I'm baffled by it.  The salmon sashimi was a perfect cut, and with that perfect melt in your mouth buttery texture (literally disintegrates in your mom upon eating it).  The other slices, I forget their names (one's translucent and the other one is an opaque white) were equally delicious.  And yes...nothing frozen in the middle...  Finally the udon. Like I said I had the curry udon and this place has truly made me a convert of udon.  Because it's in a bowl of hot curry (was on more of the spicy side), the noodles were soft but had the absolute perfect bite I could ever expect on ANY noodle.  Dressed with the curry and the dish as a whole was so good.  My family ordered the other set meals (my mom got the shrimp one and the broth is cold but it's so pure and clean).  My mom's dish (L5) is perhaps the quintessential perfect summer dish to have.  If I ever do come back, I'm having that or what my brother ordered which was L3 (pork broth....and udon).  The dining area is small and there's two servers but the service to me, was excellent.  Even though they did miss out on an order of california roll, they quickly apologized, told the sushi chef to make it right away.  Also gave my niece an opportunity to watch the sushi chef make the california roll. ;) So all is forgiven. ^_^  But aside from that, they were so courteous, pleasant to talk to and you can tell that they oversee the restaurant very well, poured water regularly and just were very attentive.  The ONLY thing that deters me from giving a 5 stars rating is unfortunately the dessert noodles.  While I did enjoy the flavour, I think there were a couple of blunders that made this dessert just ok.  So the dessert noodles (Udon Kinako - maple syrup dressed noodles with strawberries and green tea and red bean icecream), my family got two large orders to share upon and presentation wise it's decent.  However some of the issues I had with the dessert were primarily the noodles, they were more on the harder side and almost revisit the reason why I don't like udon in the 1st place.  Also as much as I love the ice cream, I wish they were a bit more frozen so that they could hold their shape longer...I felt like no more than a few minutes the dessert was on the table the ice cream melted immediately and turned into a pool.  The ice cream (green tea and red bean) was delicious though, and I normally don't fancy green tea ice cream, but this was very good and not overpowered with cream.    Having said all that, I'm definitely coming back for another round, and try out another dessert, the other desserts do look amazing."}
{"text":"I went to this place twice already. The first time I had udon with soup. I didn't like it so much because the broth is very light seasoned. For those who like strong taste I wouldn't recommend it. For the second visit I ordered the dish which has cold udon and 3 different sauces to dip in. It was my first time to eat that way, and I really liked it!   Their udon is handmade, service is very friendly, price is decent. All in all its a good place to have a nice meal!"}
{"text":"Really cute place. great service!  Loved the plum wine. loved every order.  The only reason why I didn't give a 5/5 is because I had asked if the cold udon (on special) was really cold or room temperature, the waitress said it was boiled and quickly rinsed in cold water so it should be too cold. No, it was fridge cold and not that fun to eat on a rainy day. I should've just ordered the hot soup.   Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Very authentic. Great food, however the curry noodles weren't that great. The service was wonderful and the sushi was very good. Would go back any day."}
{"text":"Their udon noodles here are homemade, they also sell it for you to bring home to cook.  Service is excellent, it's really neat that they give you a bib to put on when you order the curry noodles so that you could be a little messy.  They also serve sashimi and sushi here, but a little pricey for me to try, but the next table ordered it and it looked pretty fresh.  The amount of curry was acceptable and it tasted delicious!"}
{"text":"Finally there is real Japanese in Toronto.  Okay I am not a big fan of Udon but the Black Cod was simply melt in your mouth amazing.  The quality of the sashimi was absolutely superior and the shrimp and chicken Tempura was the best I have ever had.  The portions are definitely more Japanese than American but I absolutely I love it!"}
{"text":"The udon restaurants have been all the rage in London and Paris but I was surprised to have found one here. Well, I didn't find it, my friend had suggested we come. Their menu is actually pretty huge and they don't just serve the cold and hot udon, but also rice, sushi, sashimi, and grilled dishes. If you don't like udon, but your friend does, it's okay, you can still come and find something japanese you might like.  I ordered the Bushi Udon Zan Mai, which gives you three types of udon dishes to try (zan is three i think). The platter had a portion of cold udon, a bowl of hot curry with beef, hot tsuke pork, and zaru with mixed vegetable and shrimp tempura. For 14.99 it was a lot of food and I was over stuffed.  I was not expecting cold udon when I ordered, but I was pleasantly surprised at how great it tasted with each hot dip.   They have a baby chairs and service is great. I really like this place!"}
{"text":"Homemade udon with local ingredients. Bushi Udon Kappo does have a good concept and their udon is quite good.   We shared:  Hot Bowl Udon in Soy-sauce-based Bonito-broth Soup ($6.50) - a little over cooked and the udon was a little soft  Zaru - Cold Udon Served with Soy-sauce-based Bonito Flavour Dipping Cold Soup ($7.50) - great chewiness and texture  But sadly both lack flavour. I know the udon is the star of the show but just not enough to be the main attraction.   Seriously, is the fresh udon much better than the frozen ones I got from T&T? No really by much. Maybe this is one of the reason I never have the urge to come back here again!"}
{"text":"Pretty good little Japanese restaurant for lunch. I would consider it to be a little pricey, since their lunch deals are around $14-$15. That being said, you do get a fair amount of food, with a main dish, two little side dishes and I think also a side salad. Being an udon restauarant, I decided I had to try their udon and got the fried tofu udon. The texture of the noodles stood out to me as being very unique. Firstly, the noodles were a bit flatter than udon noodles that I've had before, which are much rounder. I also thought these noodles were a little bit harder, and slightly chewy. To be honest, I quite preferred it to the soft, sometimes slightly soggy udon I've had at other places! The fried tofu was delicious as well, and had a slightly sweet flavour. The broth in the soup was good. My noodles were $9.50 and my meal in the end was about $12. Again, definitely kind of a pricier establishment, but the noodles are handmade and the ingredients are fresh, so I guess it's worth it. Portion was sufficient for lunch. I would not mind trying their sushi or other dishes if I am in the area again!"}
{"text":"3.5 for me.  So came here cause the gf loves udon.  So when we heard about them coming to Toronto and opening up, we had to visit them.  We came on a random thursday night and we able to get seats immediately around 7pm.  We ordered the black cod as an appetizer and it was okay.  In fact, I think the gf was a little disappointed as she was hoping for some killer black cod.  It was alright (3.5 theme for the night).  For mains, we got Tsuke with pork and Onions and Becky got the Curry Beef with veggies.  I found the Tsuke's broth to be a little salty and lacked a little character.  The udon tho was definitely good.  No complaints there are all.  The curry beef tasted and felt very standard.  There was nothing special about it, tho the beef was tender.  Overall, an A-OK experience.  We went uptown just for this restaurant.  I would have to say, I don't believe it's THAT good to warrant a trip on it's own.  If you're in the area and want some udon, it's not a bad choice.    Ohh and PS. Slow slow service."}
