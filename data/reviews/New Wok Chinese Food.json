{"text":"Always our old standby for a quick delicious meal.  Wife loves the hot and sour soup"}
{"text":"The food is average...The customer service is average...the menu prices online are wrong...the flavor of a Chinese dish is bland ...all this place knows how to do is add spice to the dish to takeaway from the true flavor.....the food aint bad, just not great....if you want average Chinese food, come here."}
{"text":"I haven't ate here in years and I finally ate here for lunch today. I had the lunch special #20 Mongolian Beef and my boyfriend had the #10 Orange Chicken. My Mongolian Beef was very salty and the egg roll seem old and not fresh at all. I ate a little but had to throw the rest away because  it was too salty. Ughh wast of money!!! My boyfriend Orange chicken was over cook and his egg roll was also old and not fresh. I've been craving  New Wok and I'm so DISAPPOINTED!!! I won't be going back.. No thank you!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food from a local place. The staff are friendly and the portions are huge. Highly recommend if you have a hankering for chinese food at a good price."}
{"text":"Visiting from California & came here with my grandfather tonight, he loves the place. He orders the same thing every time, shrimp low mein. I had the honey sesame chicken, both were very good. The waitress was very friendly, she even recognized my grandfather as a regular and new what he wanted to order. Seems most their orders are take-out, I don't know why, there's plenty of space..it's clean..waiters are friendly."}
{"text":"Just came here the other day and it was decent (in a good way), their fried rice was really delicious and the egg rolls were like no other place I've tried, I would recommend coming here if you want to try something else other than panda express."}
{"text":"This is a traditional made to order Chinese restaurant that I have eatin from for a decade.Prices are average,food is good quality and service is prompt.I usually do take out as there are better places decor wise,but for a \"don't feel like cooking...don't feel like sitting/eating out...got a taste for fresh cooked Chinese take out,this is the spot in Avondale."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. The Moo goo gai pan is sooo delicious.  And don't get me started on the Won TON soup. So freaking good. And the sizes are big, especially for the price. I love their homemade pepper and oil melody for the soup.  And I must have an egg roll everytime I visit. The only reason I'm giving 3 stars is because I have tried a couple other menu items that I could totally pass on for the rest of my life"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place out and so I finally did here is what I think of it. I ordered Orange chicken which had really small pieces of chicken and also wanted Pork fried rice on the same plate but they dont mix n match to what the customer wants you have to order a seperate side and the pricing I personally believe is way off. It looks like all the sides or almost every dish including sides are set at just bout $9.00 pretty sad. I also ordered these Potstickers which again I think were Over Priced. I odrered two items and my bill was just under $20.00. I was lookiing forward to having a Chinese food close by but I will have to try another place. I hope this helps."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today! I loved it I got the Mongolian beef lunch special. They are not stingy with the portions I enough for lunch tomorrow. The meT was juicy, tender, and the perfect amount of spicy. Did mention it was only $6 plus tax? You get a lot of food for not a lot of money. Another positive was that the service was fast and friendly! Most def coming back!"}
{"text":"I love it! I ate here 6 years ago, and it was terrible. I just ordered yesterday to give it anothermshot, and they won me! the noodles were yummu, as well as the beef and broccoli. the shrimp fried rice was mediocre. Not enough shrimp. New Asain Star is the place to go for shrimp fried rice, or any fried rice."}
{"text":"Place was clean for the most part. Paid $20 for two Dinner meals and two drinks. We had the Beef & Broccoli and the Garlic Chicken. Both meals were good but not great. Both the Beef and Chicken had a different texture almost like it was imitation. Service was a little wanting as well. We got what we paid for and even that seemed a little too generous. Over all: Fair"}
{"text":"So a little background on my experience here. This was the first chinese and first restaurant I ate when i moved to AZ 12 years ago. It was always good until one time i found a hair in my food,(it was not hair from a head or arms, it was from a worse place.... use your imagination) i remember how ashamed and embarrassed they were. Years later I tried it again and it was good. I have sense moved further and frequent once in a while. With my favorite dish being the sishuan chicken. Lately though the food has tasted awful. This past weekend all their dishes were bad. Orange chicken, teriyaki and my favorite dish were just bland, no taste. Sad to say but they have gone downhill.   Its a little embarrassing but they have one award from like 10 years ago still hanging. Obviously their golden years are now gone."}
{"text":"Second time here. A mom and pop feel, just the place I've been craving since we moved to Arizona. Have patience the food is worth it"}
{"text":"scam of a place  menu has one price but they ring you up just a little more not so much you will notice. Then when you get home you look at your recite and realize you have been overcharged but not to the point that it is worth going back up there for."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good. I ordered the Mongolian beef and it was delicious. It came in a pretty large serving, at least the \"meal\"version did. Only bad thing is that  It's located next to a smoke shop, not the best place to bring a family. I recommend ordering take out if you eat here."}
{"text":"Felt like some Chinese that was not Panda Express-like and being this place was very close and on my way home, I decided to give it a try.  More like a fast food place with lots of pictures of food than a typical (Hawaii style) Chinese restaurant. It did smell a bit stale inside, do not think I would want to eat in. The menu was about what you would expect. Wanted some good noodles, with veggies, etc. Ordered the House Lo Mein to go. Took about 10 minutes, paid and left. Got home and unpacked the food. Good amount of food, mostly noodles, not much taste. I added some hot mustard and soy, salt and pepper which made it  better. To me, it did not appear that much care went into the preparation of this dish. I could not eat all of it and my two canine pals did not seem to be interested in what was left.  Think I will pass on any further visits to New Wok."}
{"text":"Came for lunch. Ordered #7, sesame chicken with white rice and egg roll. They brought me some pile of vegetables covered with peanuts. I requested correct meal with rice and egg roll. Messed up again and brought my low mein instead of egg roll."}
{"text":"My husband and I went in for lunch. I guess it should of been a red flag that the place was empty I mean there's a lot of businesses around. Your better off going to Panda Express on Avondale Blvd and Van Buren."}
{"text":"Good clean environment with quality food. Quick service. Great place for quick lunch. They have classic Chinese dishes. Their customer service is decently good"}
{"text":"It was ok, we will mostly likely not go again.   We placed an order for take out. Pork Foo Young and Sesame Chicken. The egg in the foo young was very dry and the sauce was kinda of tasteless. The Sesame Chicken was the usual fried chicken in honey sauce, it was ok. The rice was moist and hot."}
{"text":"This place was great when it first opened but it has gone down hill since. The fried rice is blah and the Lo mein is starchy and tasteless.  It used to be great! I wish they would change back to the food they served years ago."}
{"text":"This place is over priced for sub-par on-the-go Chinese food. I ordered some Cantonese style noodles from the place for lunch and left, when I got back to work, I opened the box and some of the stuff was burnt. Only a third of the box was filled and it was an $15.00 plate, could have gone to Panada Express and gotten waaaay more food. Such a rip off. On top of that there was waaaay too much MSG used."}
{"text":"Lovely people and great service. If you are looking for a great chinese restaurant in Avondale, New Wok fits that description. Quiet atmosphere located in the Frys shopping strip off Lower Buckeye Road. They have a variety of foods on their menu that remind of New York City Chinatown. My favorite dish is the duck fried rice. You can order over the phone, too, for faster service. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've been here quite a bit in the last 6 months. The first time I ordered the house dinner, which comes at around 30 bucks if you don't order any specialty items (3 entries, fried rice and lo mein), was actually great. The only thing that bothered me was the fried rice, which was slightly over-fried but still delicious. The last couple of times, however, have been a complete disappointment.   2 months ago I ordered kung pao beef without peanuts and they seem to have added extra peanuts instead. Yesterday I ordered pork fried rice as part of a house dinner and it came with a few chunks of uncooked pork. Both times I had to throw the food away, since I couldn't be bothered to drive back and make them cook it again. I did, however, call them yesterday to make sure they knew about the uncooked pork. The girl who answered was quite nice and logically asked if I was sure it was uncooked, as the pork is marinated in a red sauce that makes it look pink once cooked. Of course, I've ordered pork fried rice enough to know when I'm eating raw pork. At first I thought they were chunks of tomato, which was weird but I took a bite anyway. As soon as i bit into it I realized I was eating raw pork. I spit it out and told my friends to stop eating the rice at this point. We went through it and discovered at least 5 big chunks of uncooked pork. Thankfully nobody had started eating the rice, so we just threw that away and ordered pizza.   I'm hoping I don't get sick!  Edit: I'm giving this 2 stars instead of 1, as the first few times were 4 star quality. Getting raw pork in your food is a BIG FAT NO, though."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm being too picky but I came for lunch because they open at 11. I get there around 11:20 expecting to wait a while for my food because they just opened. I get there, lights are on, someone's behind the counter but the door is locked! The person at the counter just stares at me as I try again and no luck. So I'm walking back to my car and a lady pulls up. I tell her it's locked and she says \"oh I'm going to the smoke shop next door, not this place. They changed management recently and I don't like them anymore. They're terrible.\"  Figures."}
{"text":"I like the food. I just came in for lunch. They have good lunch specials. Owner seems to be kind to customers and caring. I had the orange chicken with fried rice and eggroll. He's been open for 11 years, that's pretty long. If you're in the area give them a try, it's good food."}
{"text":"Good and fast... food  Some coworkers and I rely on this place as a regular standby for Chinese food.  Portions are reasonably large and the dishes are flavorful. All things being relative in the West Valley, this place is top-five for Chinese restaurants.  Not a haute eatery by any means. More like a side diner you would find in a large city.   The ladies who run the place and nice and quick. The Mongolian Beef is my and a coworker's go-to dish.  Lunch Special with a soda will run you about $11 with tip."}
{"text":"Duck Fried Rice! That's all I have to say....  Not really. The food is good. The pork lo mien is pretty tasty and leaves that porky greasy taste that I love! The \"Arizona Wings\" are a garlic based delight. It's a little over priced and it takes a little longer than it should to get the food, but it's worth it in my opinion. There are better places, but if you're looking for quality \"fast food\" Chinese, this is the place to go. Better than Panda Express.   The Happy Family is an affordable mean that mixes many different meats. The sauce is good and the price is great.   The egg rolls are OK, but if you're an East Coaster you already know that no egg rolls really are made as good as they are East of the Mississippi.   Yeah, the mustard is in packets, like everywhere else. Deal with it."}
{"text":"I wasn't disappointed at all. The only complaint I had was the fried rice. I just wasn't a fan, but the place was not crowded, the service was great and very friendly."}
{"text":"Located in a little strip mall in Avondale in the Fry's parking lot this is the only Chinese food place that could be considered a mom and pop.  But its not.    First of all this place is over priced.  Its about 9.75-8.75 for a dinner combo and you don't get soup with the meal that was my first complaint.  The second was they skimp out on the meat in the dish and load you up with plain fried rice (its just soy sauce rice basically) and plain soba noodles.  The crab puffs were good the egg roll was OK.  I had the garlic chicken which was nothing special.  It had that fake brown sauce which had no hint of garlic.  I cant believe that these places don't chop fresh garlic into their meals.  Overall I would say avoid this one.  The food is about average and the service is too.  One other thing I asked for hot mustard and yes they brought me out packets like you would find at a fast food place.  Also my grandma asked for lemon for their water and they brought out a lemon packet for that too.  They said they had no fresh lemons :( that pretty much sums it up."}
{"text":"Not bad, but not the best I've ever had. I rated it a 3, but on a good day, it can easily be a 4. Three seems better than average, so I'll keep it at that. The server has been friendly and helpful every time I've eaten here. We've ordered food to go on several occasions as well. Sometimes there's a misunderstanding on phone orders, but they're usually good more often than not. In Hawaii, there was a Chinese restaurant that serves this crunchy cake noodle dish that I loved, and this is the first place I've found that serves it. Its called Cantonese Noodles. The one in Hawaii serves it with water cress and boneless crispy chicken thighs, with a brown gravy. Here, they make it a little differently, but its still good when I'm craving that particular dish. If u order it to go, ask for the gravy to be put in a separate container....unless you WANT the noodles to be soft. Other things we like here are the chicken lo mein, Singapore noodles, and orange chicken. Their honey walnut shrimp is good too, but you have to want something sweet. I always ask for extra chili oil because I love that stuff. If you want a lot, be specific or else they'll only give you 2-3 depending on who's at the cash register. Overall, they're not too shabby."}
{"text":"This restaurant is wonderful for fine in and take out! $6.95 lunch specials. Great portions, and super clean!!! Vegetables are cooked perfectly, and fresh. Service is prompt and dosen't disapoint. I'll be back soon!"}
