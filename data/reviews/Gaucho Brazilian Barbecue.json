{"text":"Ok, being a Brazilian and a rodizio fan, I must say: this place is the real deal! I only get to go back home once a year, and Gaucho's is exactly like the Churrascarias back home: all you can eat meat, salad buffet and typical side dishes. 

As for the BBQ meat, my favourites are the Picanha (a must try, in my opinion), costela (ribs) and chicken heart. 

Make sure to let the waiters know if you like your meat well done. In Brazil is common to have it done a little on the raw side. 


PS.: All my canadian friends are grossed out by the thought of it, but I strongly encourage everybody to try the grilled chicken hearts. Tasty stuff, I guarantee!"}
{"text":"Good but dinner is very expensive. If you don't like meat don't go. You will get the meat sweats - there's just that much meat"}
{"text":"As much as I dislike using the word 'epic' to describe things (these days, everything is considered 'epic'), if I HAD to describe one experience with this word, the Rodizio dinner at Gaucho would be it.

To start, we each had a caipirinha cocktail (lime and sugar can liqueur over ice) served traditionally to 'open the stomach'. Very tasty, but quite strong... not for the weak of heart. We were also served a complimentary appetizer of mandioca frita (cassava wedges topped with cheese, sea salt, and oregano)- very good, and nice and hot.

Gaucho's 'salad bar' for me, could have been the entire meal. The most incredible fish stew... the most memorable dish. Could have had several servings of this stew, if it had not been for the barbeque.

I am in love with the huge scewers of meat that the servers haul around... it's so primal. 'RAWR! MEAT! I SLICE YOU SOME!' 
Meat, luscious meat. Meat wrapped in bacon! Meat wrapped in bacon, wrapped in meat... (maybe not, but one can always dream).

Will cost you a considerable bit of money, but it's well worth it."}
{"text":"Meat was very good, excellent selection and service was top notch.

5 stars mainly for the beef ribs which is not served in many other places I've been to here in Canada"}
{"text":"To clarify why I gave Gaucho 3-stars and Bolero 4-stars is because I found, at least the time when I went, most of the meat at Gaucho to be a little overcooked for my liking even though I had gone for the first dinner seating. At least with Bolero, if I go early enough, I'm able to get rare to medium-rare meat on some of the skewers.  I generally don't prefer my beef past medium and the one time I went to Gaucho, the beef was quite a bit past medium."}
{"text":"First time at gauchos and was really impressed the food was excellent and plentiful but what most impressed me was the service which was absolutely wonderful I highly recommend this delightful surprise to anyone"}
{"text":"Having been to both Brazilian rodizio places in Calgary, I have to say I was more impressed with Guacho's than Bolero's. Bolero's salad bar is much larger with more variety but the main reason for going to these places is the meat which Guacho's does much better. The meat at Bolero's was too salted, dry and overcooked.  We did go after 8pm so that might have been the reason but it's still not a good excuse. Guacho's meat skewers were more juicy and tasty with more unique items like chicken hearts and foot long beef ribs, aka Flintstone style (which I'm still dreaming of). Guacho's meat stew was better than Bolero's too in the flavour depth.

Only issue with Guacho's is that it WAS small and non-air conditioned however in their new place it is a much more enjoyable place with plenty of room and air-conditioning.  I've have been to Gaucho's numerous times now and have yet to be disappointed with the quality and preparation of the meat.  We had great service at the smaller location but I have yet to see how the new location handles a full crowd.

I can't compare it to other places like in the US or Brazil but I have heard that it is pretty damn close to authentic as you would expect up here."}
{"text":"And the meat kept on coming...... The Gaucho Brazilian Barbecue has an unique approach to serving BBQ items.   Served on sword-like, 3 foot long skewers, by gauchos.  Need more?  Just pull one over.  Portuguese is not mandatory. Appetite is.  Meat is nicely spiced.  Staff is friendly and attentive.

There was also a salad bar for some green stuff.

I found it a little on the pricey side, but will come again."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with grilled meat and they do it well.  Shame on the owner's for pushing their old wine at full price.  We went on a Friday and the service was good despite the poor guy having to push old wine.  The food was great but seemingly there was no wine left in the place except for $60.00 and up bottles of red that were older than dirt.  When every table in the place has the same bottle, more than a little suspect.  I understand that as an owner you need to turn over your product but you need to be smarter than that or you need to offer it at a discounted price.  Don't come to Gaucho's for the wine but for the grilled meat it's good."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant! Have been there a few times, the food is excellent! Very well prepared/ high quality meats. I tried this place and then tried Bolero, and I must say I am far more impressed with the taste of the meats from this place! The atmosphere is very classy and the staff were amazing. My boyfriend and I came in on a very busy Friday night without a reservation and though they were booked solid they managed to fit us in. They even gave us both a complimentary beverage while we waited, which I feel they did not have to do as they had nothing to make up for. This peaks to the level of customer service at this place and the emphasis they place on good customer satisfaction. We have always had great service everytime we go!"}
{"text":"Good place with a cross between a buffet and like nothing else except a real Brazilian style meal. When I say that, I mean it is like nothing I have had before, it is where many servers come around with large skewers of assorted meats that you can try. They come around many many times. Its kind of all you can eat style. The service was good and the many staffers were friendly. One thing I did not like was the saltiness of the food. Like anyone would do while cooking meat, one salts it (slightly) to bring the flavour out. Gauchos over does this process."}
{"text":"The food here is exceptional service is great but I think for 42$ they should have better cuts of meat"}
{"text":"I've eaten here before. Dinner was $35 for all you can eat, and Lunch was $17.  My wife and I stopped here on Feb 26 2012 after seeing the sign out front $14 for lunch 7 days a week. We were a little surprised to learn after we sat down that Lunch was actually $22 per person and the advertisment out front was for 200grams of meat. Nothing else included! The $22 Lunch was for the non stop meat service. The food was Ok and the salad bar was also OK. Missing from the meat service was the little filets that we had here at previous meals. My wife and I have eaten at some superb brazilian BBQ in the Florida Keys that we would give a 5/5 for food. This place is Ok at a 3/5 for food. We also thought the sign out front was a little misleading, and felt like we had been subjected to the old bait and switch. The final bill for Lunch with 2 cokes was $55 including GST. It's pricey for what you get. I wonder how much dinner really is now."}
{"text":"Do NOT get fooled by the \"Tue-Sun $14.00 Lunch\" sign on the sidewalk!! We got in to find out $14.00 only if you eat one type of meat! That's very deceiving!

The \"salad bar\" was filled with carbohydrates to fill you up - sweet potatoes, potato salad, rice, and buns (except the fish and broccoli). It's a little too obvious that they don't want you to eat too much meat.

Meat was way too SALTY. Everything tasted like salt.

Servers rushed from table to table. If you don't insist on which part of the meat you want, their ninja hands just give you the worst cut and walk away. We got a piece of \"sirloin\" and it tasted like beef jerky! We were still looking and he cut it already, dropped it on our plate and walked away! They don't care what you want, my husband wanted one chicken heart and the server wanted to give him 2, my husband basically had to yell at him to give him one only.

Restaurant was very noisy, even though it was half empty when we got there. Real bad acoustic design.

Understaffed, very hard to get our waitress.

We thought this would be a $30-ish meal, ended up to be $50-ish. Totally not worth the money.

Will NOT go back."}
{"text":"We arrived at 3 pm for a late lunch and were promptly told that they were closing for an hour at 4 pm and asked whether this was enough time.  We could not see why 1 hour was insufficient for their small self-serve buffet and side of meat, so we sat down.  We were virtually ignored, aside from being given our small portion of meat and asked once about drinks.  We were never asked whether we enjoyed the meal or needed anything as the staff proceeded to clean all around us.  We left after 20 minutes and felt uncomfortable the entire time. If you close from 4 to 5, do so, but please do not start unofficially closing at 3 and making your 'guests' feel like they are inconveniencing you.  We will not be returning for their average food and horrible service."}
{"text":"Was there for a Christmas lunch hosted by my boss. The prairie region managers from the three provinces met and had a fantastic meal. The service was fast and continual, the food was great."}
{"text":"In comparison to the other Brazilian restaurant in town, I would say this one is so-so.  The sides offered here were nice.  The mashed potatoes were awesome!  The service was not anywhere near where it should be for a 'high end' restaurant.  I had to flag people down constantly.  The meat selection was rare and nothing else.  I don't think I'll come back.  I'd rather Boleros."}
{"text":"I have recently visisted Gaucho with a friend. It was my suggestion due to the wonderful reviews on Yelp, though I wasn't dissapointed, it wasn't the 'meal' of my life either. Perhaps I went in there with too high of expectations from all the wonderful reviews, making me believe I will be taken away to a new continent and new experiences simply from enjoying a bbq experience like to other.
Don't get me wrong, the food was delicious, and YES like all others I barely walked out of there, feeling completely, happily, FULL. 
I just wish the amtoshpere was a little more welcoming, and comforting, in that south american 'heat' way, but it just wasn't. Perhaps it was the Monday blues, or just us. Whatever it was, it didn't fill my spirits up. 
But I will give it another chance, once again..."}
{"text":"Took a friend here for lunch between Christmas and New Years.  Our first time here and we'll definitely be back.  The food was excellent and the service amazing.  Their prices are very reasonable for this type of restaurant.  Look forward to our next visit.  Next time we'll try the dinner service."}
{"text":"Gaucho Brazilian Barbecue, Calgary - Restaurant. This is a must visit for you all. Unless you are a vegan but even that there is plenty on the menu for you. Surprise someone special with authentic Brazilian experience. It is as authentic as it gets. I have been there a few times with my hubby and with the Kids the experience is awesome. Highly recommend this restaurant for everyone to check it out. No matter the price you will walk out there feeling satisfied."}
{"text":"The food here is so good ! I took my wife for Valentines and it was $60 but it was worth it. It was our first time going and I would go back.

The hostess was great and friendly, and our waiter was great also. Always making sure we had something to drink and asking about how everything was tasting.

The food was again awesome. There was so much of it and everything from the salad bar to the meat was perfect. I ate so much I was in a food coma but it was worth it.

All in all, its a great value for the price you pay and you should definitely eat here !"}
{"text":"All I can say is meat-ahoy!

We were there today for the lunch rodizio, it was $17 and worth every penny. Excellent quality and you can eat till you are bursting.

I've been lucky enough to eat in a few great Churrascaria in S. America and Gaucho's represents.

Might become one of my new favourite restaurants."}
{"text":"This was a great experience. I will definitely be back....they make the best mojitos in Calgary. This is the first place and first time for our dinner group to get together. Stay tuned for our next adventure."}
{"text":"I think I gave myself Gout and at bare minimum came down with a bad case of the meat sweats.

The food is deadly !! Even the salad bar which in most places is quite lackluster was delicious.

Our server, Charity was one of the best i've had.

Only downside is that it got a bit loud which made it a bit hard to deal with just as a couple.

Im going back!

{"text":"It was my second time here at Gaucho's and I have to say, it is still delicious. BBQ-ed on giant skewers, Gaucho's really hits the spot if you are craving that good ole Alberta beef. I've been to other rodizio restaurants before (such as Copacabana in Toronto and Bolero in Calgary) so needless to say, this was not my first Brazilian rodeo. 

Included in the dinner price ($40 per person) is Top Sirloin, Rump Steak, Parmesan beef, Spicy Steak, Chicken Wings, Sausages, Lamb, Chicken Wrapped Bacon, pork ribs ... etc My favourite was the lamb which was good because it didn't have a really strong gamey taste that is commonly associated with cooking lamb. There was also some nice crispy basa fish at the buffet bar which was really tasty.

One star deducted for the lack of grilled pineapple served skewer style (though it IS on their dessert menu at an additional $8). 

If I am in town again, I would want to also try their Brazilian mate (pronounced: Mah-tay) which is a loose tea that is consumed from a coconut-looking cup and a metal straw with holes at the bottom."}
{"text":"For good or bad, I'm frightfully addicted.
Strange as it may seem, NOBODY had mentioned the S-T-A-F-F.
Let's start with Waltemar.
He is everybody's CRAZY GrandDad.
He is a man on a mission with Skewers packed full of meat.
You WILL Protest, that ' you've had way to much'.
He just says to me..\"You're a BIG BOY!\"
Yah, right, I'm 5'4 and round as a barrel.
Charity,  is a wonderfully weird blonde Maritimer....
Treats everybody like a cousin. She's adorable.
Fatima. Classy, Sweet....
Oh Yah, the food?
I've been to Bolero 3 times. It's wonderful but a bit more upscale.
Gaucho will feed you SILLY for far less than you can imagine.
STAY AWAY FROM THE SALAD BAR.... because the rest is just far too good. The Salad Bar is terrific, but the meat?
Just pick a little at the Bar, you definitely CAN go back but Waltemar....
 Waltemar will push you to the limit. He's not alone, there's a few others with wings, sausages, pork, beef....
This is Heaven for Carnivores.
I always take close friends and we always walk out HURTING.

You can not walk out without HURTING.
In Bolero, you get a Green Card/Red Card.
Green means bring it on, Red means STOP or give me a break.
Gaucho has 1 pedal and no cards.
GAS.
The Brake Pedal never kicks in till you 'scream' thanks but STOP.
I Love Love Love these people.
There is the oddest, lovliest chemistry with the staff.
It all feels like Family. It all feels just right.

I took my stepdad. He's tough to please. VERY.
Two days later he's on the phone asking me out for lunch.

Uh-Huh

{"text":"Very tasty selection of endless meats at a reasonable price in a cozy environment.

The house cocktails were a nice option that I really enjoyed, sipped casually with ice water on the side to cleanse the pallet."}
{"text":"Oh, my goodness...I've been to Gaucho a few times before and have enjoyed it thoroughly. My most recent visit was a pivotal moment...for me anyway! Let's just call this \"Ode to Passion Fruit\".

Most of the time, the meaterrific deliciousness consumes my brain (and all of the space in my tummy) so dessert is usually out of the question. Ah, but the stars aligned and I had this feeling that this would be the time I would finally make it. 

Yes, yes, the meat was delicious. 11 different meats being circulated usually leaves nothing to be desired. However, this time I was craving something cool and creamy to finish my meal. Of course, I had already eaten some of the lovely sides ( the black beans, and the pineapple cucumber mint salad are my personal favourites) but something was still missing.

You would think that after pork tenderloin, garlic steak, parmesan encrusted beef, beef ribs, lamb with mustard and mint, and beef ribs, that nothing could entice me. Wrong! The Mousse de Maracuja was the one thing that I couldn't stop thinking of. 

To the uninitiated, passion fruit is a tangy, seedy, gelatinous pulp from inside the tough rind. When prepared properly, it can be transformed into smoothies, cakes, and mousse, like the Mousse de Maracuja. The passion fruit coulis sits atop the mousse in a martini glass. You need to get your spoon into the mousse below, and as you lift it out it will have a thin veil of the passion fruit coulis. I am a huge passion fruit fan and have often been disappointed when the passion fruit itself is overloaded with sugar. In this case, it is not. The mousse is cool and creamy, the passion fruit is not overpowering and tastes just like fresh, sans seeds.

Word to the wise - next time you are visiting Gaucho's, save some room for this amazing dessert!"}
{"text":"I went to Gaucho for lunch last Friday. Did you know that you can save a ton of dough by going to Gaucho for lunch instead of dinner? $17 instead of $35. True, it is 7 kinds of meat instead of 12 kinds, but face it, after a few skewer rounds, you lose track of what you are eating anyway, so it doesnt matter too much.
So, for $17 lunch, this might be one of the best deals in town. There was an entire hot+cold buffet, which consisted of all kinds of salads like regular salad, crab salad, beet salad, potato salad etc, and hot meals like mashed potatoes, rice, FISH STEW, onion rings etc. These people don't skimp on their buffet items, let me tell you that! That fish stew was amazing, by the way. But I digress. I did make the mistake of piling on my plate with the delicious buffet items, but then the meat started coming, and after about 4-5 turns of delicious chargrilled juicy meat, I was full. But, I kept eating. I had to - it was so good! Anyway, after stuffing my face and telling the waiter that I was done - no really, this time I was - I settled for coffee. Such copious amounts of food was already putting me to sleep. Then the coffee came - true Brazillian coffee it seemed, because let me tell you, it was FANTASTIC. It was out of this WORLD. Seriously, I even asked the waiter if I could buy this coffee to take home and he pointed out some 'Gaucho' coffee bags for sale near the entrance. If only I owned a coffee maker, I would have snatched one up, but alas, I dont.

The coffee itself would have kicked up my review to 5 stars, but I give it 4 stars because when we first came, we had to keep standing for 5 minutes  until someone seated us (mind you, the restaurant was almost empty), and then another 5 minutes after we sat down, for a waiter to come and officially greet us and ask us which lunch special we wanted.

But a solid 4 stars!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing however we made a reservation for our anniversary and they put us in their 2nd dining room and it had all the atmosphere of a well painted cafeteria. Had we known that we would have been seated back there we would have not went there for our anniversary. I would have given a 5 star review if not for this."}
{"text":"Excellent price except Pão de Queijo has to be ordered as an additional cost. Otherwise the meat selection was tasty and plentiful. Servers came quickly and efficiently, they were polite and gracious. We always come back when we're in town."}
{"text":"By far the best Brazilian BBQ I've had. Coming from California with larger restaurants & serving the masses, Gaucho's smaller establishment makes it so that the quality of food is at its best. All the sides are fresh, their cheese puffs are piping hot (complimentary M-F), meats are medium-rare but can be cooked longer & seasoned perfectly. Love the lamb & rump steak. Service is great as well. Don't forget to wash down the meat sweats with their Guarana pop!"}
{"text":"Biggest disappointment. We went here to celebrate a birthday. The had no music going, food was just ok, terribly overpriced for what you get. Brazilian bbq in Toronto offers live entertainment and music and much better culture. Not worth the 260.00 I paid for 5 people. Gauchos did not engage just quickly came to table asking if you want meat. Very little interaction"}
{"text":"Great service,  great selection,  great prices. 
I usually come during the week, they always take care of me,  the employees are always smiling and welcoming.  
Being a meet lover it's the perfect meal after a good practice."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch on Sunday  the food was great,but there was no fillet.  The advertised price for lunch was $14.00. But was really $22.00.   Cost per person  was $30.00 with a coke, tip and gst.  Really too expensive for lunch. I weigh 45 kg, impossible for me to eat $22.00 worth of meat.   I will starve myself for a few days before going here next time......LOL."}
{"text":"They had a $20 lunch deal (original $25) when we came on a weekday. We were greeted right when we walked in and noticed only a few tables were occupied.

We ordered the Guaraná ($4) as our beverages, and it gives off a taste of a Brazilian version of Ginger ale.
Their salad bar had quite a few different options including some hot items. The meat doesn't come around your table until you visit the salad bar. There's some heavy items on the salad bar that can fill your stomach faster such as potato salad and their hot items. I avoided the extra carbs and stuck with just leafy greens. They had 2 different hot sauce at the salad bar and it goes well with every type of meat if you're looking for that kick of spice.

During lunch time they offer 7 different meats and most of the meat came out flavourful. 
I would stay away from the brisket since it was quite dry. Our favourite would be the parmesan beef! Very flavourful and juicy!
There was 2 barbecue chefs and one of them was very attentive, he noticed we were slowing down and asked us if there was anything specific we wanted. We asked for more parmesan beef and he did come back around getting us some more! 

Overall it was a great experience. Rodizio is more of a splurge meal and I would come again during their lunch deal or on special occasions"}
{"text":"This mark is really 3.5 but I'm inclined to round down instead of up. 

All the buffet items were good, with a couple of the stew items just great, and the skewered meat brought to the table was mostly nicely flavoured, but no 'wows' attached.
Not sure why, but, unlike many Indian, Vietnamese, Greek and Korean restaurants, we've never felt like returning. Given what these places represent, they should be excellent, but Gaucho just wasn't. 
The servers were friendly and did well at serving our every need, and the meats were good, but not one cut stands out, not one. In fact, many were somewhat chewy and overcooked because the few lunchtime customers present likely meant they were continually having to keep them warm over open flame. 
Hence that we might try Pampa sometime, as I know someone who used to work there, but it seems it too is not all that highly rated.
And the price is not all that small if the offerings are inadequate. 
If not wow'd, does a discerning foodie want to return?

Because the parking spots outside Gaucho aren't that plenty on a week day, we drove to and walked from a larger neighbouring parking lot, but later discovered the underground parking at the back of the complex. 

If you want mostly a meat meal, this place is quite good, but if you want to be amazed, skip it. Not much more to be said here..."}
{"text":"I was going to put two stars, but from some of the \"overly detailed positive\" ratings this place has gotten (those look like fake reviews just FYI) I am going to be brutally honest.  They don't have a Fogo de Chao in Calgary, not sure if they do in Canada (I'm from Houston), but it's the same type of concept except MUCH better.  Service was good and the staff was really friendly, but the meat was horrible.  Tough, and the taste was sub-par for a place that charges this much.  At lunch, we were only one of 5 tables sat....if that says anything.  Sadly, I come to Calgary a lot but won't be back here."}
{"text":"I consider myself a hefty eater. I have brought down buffets and pushed species into extinction within one sitting. Sure it's an exaggeration but forget meat sweats, I went into a food coma. 

You certainly get your moneys worth @ BR Gaucho, both in food and in experience. The service was great and those meat-stick wielding Gauchos were quick to respond, they must have some secret competition which whoever gets to serve the most meats gets the glory of the day. 

Their Mesa Quente bar blows any salad bar I've been to out of the water. It was tempting to pack my plate with as much delicious veggies and side dishes, but I knew I was there for the meat and only managed to try a little bit of each. My favourites were their salsa and bean dishes. The meat served at Gauchos was juicy, succulent, and a stark contrast to Bolero's gaucho menu, at least to me it was different. Their lamb and beef were incredible and any Gaucho that had a beef or lamb stick immediately became my friend. 

One thing I would note was that the server indicated that the Caiprinha cocktail was a great pre-meal aperitif which served as a \"stomach opener\". This drink didn't expand anything for everyone in our table. It was an expensive drink and even though it was great, I would have rather spent the money on more wine and beer.

For those wondering what a food coma feels like. Imagine starting out with the basic meat sweat symptoms: laboured breathing, excessive moisture, and self-loathing. All of this followed by sudden loss of energy and the need to find any flat surface to lie down. This night I found myself literally blacking out at the corner of my friend's living room, who graciously took pictures of me before wondering if I was suffering from a medical emergency. I also have a theory that meat coma dreams are a good way for your ID to reveal itself to you in the most disturbing sequences of events. Anyways, when I woke up from this food coma, I had man-boobs and the sudden urge to eat vegetables."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what to say about this place.  On the one hand it is lots of food... On the other hand it's a lot of food!  
Come with a bit appetite and you won't be disappointed.  The meats are quite good overall but the Pantine? Round steak was the best plus the ribs a close second.  The sides were plentiful and good for offsetting the mounds of meat being served.  
This place is best enjoyed when it is super busy as the food then comes out faster and fresher.  We just went on a Sunday night not expecting too big a crowd but the place was pretty full around 6:30.
Gives a different perspective to just having a single hunk of meat at a place like the Keg versus a variety here at Gaucho.  It is a nice change and a fun concept to dine at.
They answered our questions on allergies very well and double checked for us when we thought we may have had an issue with one of the meats.  Which turned out to be a false alarm... Just too much garlic versus an allergic reaction!"}
{"text":"Great food , great service amazing experience.  What else could you possibly need to know ?"}
{"text":"Making reservation for a weeknight at the restaurant was easy, since they take online reservations.  We actually did not decide on this place until the day of and they had opening for a seating at the time we wanted.  The restaurant was not the easiest to find, as it is actually on the ground floor of a white 7-storey office building.  Parking is at a premium there.  I ended up parking at the car wash parking lot to the north of building.  

It was my first time at Gaucho.  The BBQ meats actually exceeded my expectations.  I thought the meat would be overcooked, but it was anything but.  We like our beef medium rare and that's what they were able to find for us.  There was a beef that was seasoned with parmesan that impressed many at our table, me included.  They never came around with the chicken winglets, but the drumsticks were pretty good.  All the food were served hot (temperature-wise) and we did not think most of the  meats were over-seasoned.   The servers were friendly too.  

All of us at the table were not big eaters.  I wish I could have eaten more, but we were all done and out of the restaurant in 1.5 hours.  The effects of Gaucho can be felt a day later.  I need to balance my diet by not having meats for a couple of days."}
{"text":"Well, I am surprised that I am reviewing this restaurant with three stars, based on everything I heard about it....

My first experience with Brazilian BBQ was in Dallas Texas on a business trip, and I was absolutely blown away by the coolness of the experience, and the quality and variety of meats.

Brazilian BBQ is a neat experience no matter where you have it.  You have an indicator on the table that tells the servers to keep bringing you meat.  When you are full or need a breather, you flip it over to alert the server not to put anything else under your nose.  It is a very cool concept indeed.

For some time now, it was on my list to try the Brazilian BBQ restaurants here, and Gaucho I had heard the most raves about, so on a blistery day on July, I saught out to see what all the hype was about, and also to relive my extremely positive Texas experience.

Well.......

In my opinion, what was working:
- Ambiance was cool and rugged
- Salad bar was fantastic
- The parmesan beef was to DIE for
- Second on my to-die-for list was the garlic beef
- Price was reasonable.  $35 for all you can eat per person is a bargain in this city.

In my opinion, what was not working:
- Other than the two outstanding meats listed above, the rest were either okay, or overcooked
- Chicken was dry.  Sausages were dry.
- Waiter was tough to nail down to pay and leave.  The restaurant was busy, but not packed, so I don't think my expectations were out of line.

This restaurant is a hit with most people, so I am not sure if the few overdone meat pieces was an off day, or whether I was comparing it to my previous experience in the states where everything was a \"mind-blowing OMG\" whenever they came around.  However, the only two pieces of meat that were juicy and flavorful by my standards were the two above in my list.  The chicken wings and sausages were dry.  The rest was okay (the rest though.... was 11 additional different flavors of meat),  It was meat.... :)

If a group was going back there for a party or an experience, I would go.  For the \"experience\" I would recommend it, and for the price.  However, if someone was looking for a quality meat experience, I would share what is above.  They are going to be blown away by a few pieces, and will likely fill up on the rest.  I will give it an A-OK based on my past experience.  However, I recognize due to the uniqueness why it is getting 5 stars everywhere."}
{"text":"Rodizios are by far my favorite type of restaurants. I love meat, and the idea of endless steak, chicken, and pork is hard to pass up. I was delighted to find a rodizio in Calgary, and while I have been to superior renditions of this style of resturant, given the price of $35 for dinner Gaucho did not let me down. The meat was flavorful, the wait staff always available. I never found myself longingly looking towards the kitchen, just hoping someone would be out with another skewer of meat. 

One suggestion I would make would be to increase the quantity of items are their mesa de frios, i.e. their cold and hot buffet items. Other restaurants offer 2-3 times the amount of food items. But then again, these are much larger establishments and are also typically $10-15 more expensive."}
{"text":"Good selection of meats brought right to your table.
Good. Salad bar,(included Farofa!) but lacked the standard salad bars that normally come with these kind of restaurants.
I went for lunch and with two large glasses of house red wine and a 18% tip the bill came to 50.00

If you have never experienced a \" Rodizio\" this is a good place to start!

I was served by a very attentive Jamie, she knows the drill and how to take care of a customer!"}
{"text":"I was impressed by the flavour profiles, but disappointed by the meat, which by and large was cooked to well done. I prefer it a little more pink. 

I absolutely echo the statement regarding Parmesan beef. I'm not sure how authentic that is, but it's f*@^&ing delicious. 

Wish I wasn't sitting there with my boss... I wanted to have a caipriniha!"}
{"text":"I love this style of food eat a little eat a lot.  Every time I'm there I love the service and I think it's a very cost-effective place to eat not cheap but great value"}
{"text":"Gaucho has an incredibly awesome ambience. The music, decor, and general atmosphere are incredibly welcoming. And I've been told that the meat is awesome, but as a vegetarian, this is an incredily limiting place to eat. I ate the salad bar and that's it. 

The dessert, however, was excellent as were the drinks."}
{"text":"Lunch.

Ate too much meat which is sorta the point i guess.  The meat was all cooked well.

Service was good."}
{"text":"Not going back. 

We went on Valentine's Day, made reservations a week in advance. We were told that there was a mandatory $65/person Valentines Day promotion - all you can eat with red velvet cake for desert and champagne - no problem, sounded  great. 

Execution was far from expectations. The champagne was never served. There was 3 of us and only 2 deserts came out. We sat there and waited for the third person in our party to be served his cake... 10 minutes later the server came back and asked how the desert was, seeing the 2 deserts had been untouched, we said we were still waiting for the third desert! She informed us that the desert was only 1 per couple (the $65 wasn't per couple it was per PERSON). How can they justify this? The manager came to the table and told us it was a decision the owners made to save costs. Bad decision. For the insignificant cost of a small plate of desert, we won't be supporting a business that exploits it's customers to save a couple dollars."}
{"text":"Fantastic Brazilian BBQ. 

Smaller than the other ones but service and food is top notch. Parking is plentiful with parkade for overflow. 

The salad bar has plenty of selection and there is rice and some deep fried food. 

The staff continue to cut and provide speedy service and ample meat. Deserts are delicious and great coffee selection. 

The atmosphere is lively and very comfortable chairs. 

Pricing is decent for both lunch and dinner. 

Overall it's a must try for Brazilian BBQ in Calgary and is best one on Macleod trail."}
{"text":"I recommend this location if you've gone about 3 weeks without eating and suddenly realize that you're really hungry.  I've eaten so much that I'm convinced that unless I go without eating for the rest of the week, I'll be hitting the space bar with my stomach to do Yelp reviews from now on.  

There are an absolute abundance of meats to choose from.  Pork, ribs, bacon wrapped chicken, Parmesan beef, chicken wings, top sirloin etc.  The list goes on.  On the day I went (Wednesday), they also had grilled pear, pineapple & barbecued banana.  They were also very good.  

I didn't really touch the buffet, as my interest was almost 100% on the meat.  Savory, delicious and always on an Albertan's mind.  Great place."}
{"text":"First Time and was very happy with the service and the food, all I miss is some sort of special hot sauce, or sauces to dip the meat into. I bring my own as I enjoy meat with sauces. All the meats were grilled to perfection, loved the cheese bread, and best of all grilled pineapple. I will definitely be back and recommend it. Next time I will try lunch as well, like to try that experience."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch for the $17 lunch special it was fantastic as no corners were cut on the quality of the meats, just a smaller amount of choices. Great salad bar that also has a couple of hot dishes. There are two things about the Gaucho that make it so good; the service and the food!"}
{"text":"This place is a must see and do!!! If you ever get a chance go at lunch it's cheaper then dinner but still very worth it!"}
{"text":"If you like rodizio, this is a happenin' place for Sunday brunch, now just $18 per adult (kids $16). The side dishes (fresh spinach, salmon salad, halibut, chicken souffle, Brazilian salsa, etc.) are of very high quality, and their frothy lemonade with a hint of lime was a pleasant surprise. I wish someone would update the address, because they're now on Macleod Trail across from Chinook and I can't check in from my mobile!"}
{"text":"The service is really good. Everyone is so friendly and they really encourage to eat to your hearts content. The salad bar was really good with great options for everyone. I just wish there were more dessert options than just the grilled pineapple. Gladly come back when Im back in  Calgary. 4 stars ****"}
{"text":"Not only does Brazil have one of the best Carnivals in the world and the hottest looking people, they serve it up really fine with their rodizios.

I was so thrilled to discover a rodizio here in Calgary and specifically here at Gaucho's.  Every Sunday you can indulge in an all you can eat lunch buffet for just $28 a person.  This includes an all you can eat meat service at your table with an extensive salad bar.  Let me recommend right off the bat the palm hearts, this delicacy is banned from being served in Columbia as the palm takes 17 to 18 years to mature so therefore it has become more rare, so this is a speciality really worth having here.

The BBQ meat is cut up right before your eyes at your table by the chef, it is both succulent and tender, and in my opinion cooked to perfection.  Try a nice vinaigrette sauce with your meat but I warn you to pace yourself, there is a never ending meat selection here.

Today we accompanied our meat with an authentic Brazilian beverage of white wine and lime juice and ended our meal with a glorious helping of coconut ice cream and barbecued pineapple smothered in guava sauce.  If my buffet description doesn't get you here then for sure this dessert will, doesn't this combination make you want to come and try it.

The location is easy to get to as well; just off of Macleod trail. The management, staff and chef are indicative of Brazilian weather; warm  and incredibly personable, I know you will enjoy your visit as much as I did mine.

Beijos!!"}
{"text":"The service is amazing, I was really impressed with the service and how friendly and attentive all the employees were. Gaucho is a fun experience, you get to sit back and enjoy all the various meat that comes around to the tables. I especially liked the Lamb - and they have a good salad bar too with lots of salad options to go with all that meat."}
{"text":"I understood this place was popular so upon checking yelp, I thought ok why not. But as I watched everyone being served I realized I had made a grave mistake. NO PINEAPPLE why!?
It's nice to get a break from meat sometimes and a bit of sweetness brings back all appetite for the savory. The salad bar was also subpar. Apparently it is possible to fail at making white rice. 
The list of meats:
Top Sirloin, Rump Steak, Beef Ribs, Beef wrapped with Bacon, Sliced Steak
with Garlic, Parmigiano Beef, Pork Loin, Pork Ribs, Sausage, Chicken Wings,
Chicken Wrapped with Bacon, Chicken Hearts & Lamb.
Sad to say, none of these were stellar with the exception of the steak with garlic and chicken wrapped bacon. But you really can't fail at anything with bacon in it. Everything else was dry or \"just meat.\" 
Service was also subpar, and it was hard to get anything, including a setting which one of our diners had to go without for a bit. Then we decided to steal it off another table. At this rate, Gaucho should be tipping us for service, not the other way around.
Finally to end it, we saw pineapple dessert. The pineapple dessert was literally 3 bites. Why bring out sharing spoons if there isn't enough to go around? It was also the most expensive dessert I've ever had. 
Maybe Gaucho has seen better days, or I visited on an off day. Either way you still need reservations because the hostess will make you stand and stare at the half empty restaurant and tell you it's all reserved. The restaurant remained half empty throughout our entire meal. 
2 stars for good concept, -3 for poor execution"}
{"text":"I came on a Wednesday night, so the restaurant wasn't full (40% approx).

The meat was great. Very tasty and well cooked. Higher quality than most rodizios. The rabbit and lamb were very good and different from typical cuts you  get at statehouses.

The salad bar could be better, but I came for he meat and it was great."}
{"text":"Bring out your A-game eating skills.  Gaucho's is not for the faint of stomach.

We had a table for ten booked at 7:15 Saturday night.  The night started innocently enough with a visit to the buffet. It included some veggies, rice, etc.  With my eye on the servers walking around with the largest skewers of meat I've ever seen, I was careful not to fill my plate TOO full at the buffet table.  I was remembering the list of 16 different meats that were hopefully going to make their way into my belly over the course of the meal.

Every bit of that meal was delicious.  Every piece of meat cooked in a tasty sauce or spice.  The tastiest piece of meat was the beef and Parmesan, the most interesting thing I ate was chicken hearts.  Many at the table commented that the chicken hearts were a similar texture to liver.  I wouldn't know.  They were definitely a big tougher than regular chicken meat, but tasty enough for me to eat four or five of them.

After several rounds of meat, many of us were running out of room.  It was time to loosen our belts (I was thinking that I should have worn something with an elastic waist band).  I filled up as much of my reserves as I could but I'm pretty sure I didn't make it through more than about 10 different kinds of meat.

When I finally called it quits, I was thinking about how I should have prepared better.  If only I had started my stomach stretches a week earlier instead of the day of, I may have performed better than I did.  At the very least, I came away full and satisfied with the food I had just ingested.  I'll know better next time."}
{"text":"It sort of sounded funny that they've called a Brazilian place \"El Gaucho\" (which means \"The Cowboy\", but relates to the Patagonia cowboys - there was not much of those in Brazil, especially after that war over the Uruguay independence back in the XIX century ;-)

Anyway, I was looking for some good meat feast, and in this sense Rodizio (this is a proper name for the Brazilian \"meat buffet\") was just about what I was craving.

For those unaware, it works like that: You seat at the table, get a bottle of wine, and then servers start to pop-up and offer you a fresh, smoking pieces of meat on the shiny metal spears. You nod or dismiss, point with your finger, they cut those chunks you like and drop them on your plate.

Typical error is to eat something apart from the meat - potatoes, salads, starters, etc. Just don't! :-))) Try all the meat you can possibly ingest. Start with those little sausages - first fried, than those with more blood in them. Then move to pork and lamb, than beef. Ignore the chicken! Well you may try it, just for giggles, but not much. Trust me, it is so much more fun to try all those different flavors of fried meat - hard to believe there is so many of them existing.

When you feel like losing it, use a switch-card to give a \"red light\" to the servers and take a break. Those cards could be literally pieces of carton, or some fancy plastic figures, but whatever they are - their task is to say the servers not to pop-up just now.

Expect to get more wine and continue the game. My personal record set in San Paulo was 9 plates of fried meat. No worries, you can get there too, just practise...

Now back to our \"Gaucho Barbecue\". Khm, barbecue sounds like an insult here but oh well... It is an actual Brazilian rodizio, and it offers not as wide a scale of meats as the South American prototypes routinely do, but is quite good for this part of the world. Quality was, again, barely ok. In the best cases it was good - but I might be badly biased, simply being accustomed to that sort of food - sorry for that!

My main complain (apart from only six or so different types of ordinary meat to play with) is a huuugely inflated price. Guys, those prices are wrong. Rodizio is a great thing, but it is essentially just a \"meat-buffet\", to get together with guys from the office Friday night - and it should not bust the wallet the way Gaucho does. In Latin America those places are usually on the cheaper side, compared to the full-scale expensive restaurants, and I can't understand why it should be any different in Canada.

For those who've never been to rodizio, or would like to recreate an experience, Gaucho is a good place to go. Not so great to return, I'd say, but that happens..."}
{"text":"This place is a place after my food heart! Total quality, awesome service and all you can possibly eat. The servers will make sure of that let me tell you! Good thing I prepared for battle splitting a whole head of lettuce with Dan, thats all we ate the whole day before we came!

Gaucho is quite popular. You need to book (via internet) well in advance. I booked it for a birthday party like a month before and even then it was tricky to find a time and day for a table of ten. Lucky for us it all worked out! The meal lived up to every expectation and then some! 

The salad bar was something to behold, not too many items and not overstocked (a true sign of quality) some really tasty veggies strawberry spinach salad, salsa and other stuff a cant remember! Also hot items like rice, beans and their was also a fish stew which I was very fond of. I didn't take too much because I wanted to save plenty of room for the meat! it was all really good! 

So then the meat came. The little two sided cow card(green and red)  that signals the \"gauchos\" to come around with their meat offerings a carve it tableside. Skewered through meat swords everything was so good! Cooked to perfection and seasoned perfectly. I especially loved the beef ribs and the chicken hearts! Though i mean all the other meats were a close second! OH MAN! Now I am getting hungry just thinking about it....

In the heat of battle I started to loose my appetite, I am pretty sure I tried all the meats but man was it tough to do! 

The ONLY bad thing about gaucho was the dessert. I got this ice cream with grilled pineapple (the pineapple was dry and chewy) but you know what? I cant fault them a star for that! These guys just destroyed me in the best way possible!  I tip my hat to them! 

The aftermath: the WHOLE party went to a house and we all fell into a meat coma... Gaucho sings a sweet lullaby though! but make no mistake it can make even the most hardcore of eaters fall to their knees and beg for mercy! I will be back! oh I will be back! check it !"}
{"text":"Excellent side dishes for a Brazilian Barbecue place, and the Garlic Steak and roast pork dishes were very good, but the other 10 meats were either overcooked, tough, or too salty."}
{"text":"Just go eat there.  That's it. Spoiler warning, it's amazing.  You don't need to read any more.  If you don't live in Calgary, move, and if you can't, I weep for your very souls.  And if you're in Calgary, why are you still reading this?  Unless you're already heading there by some form of rapid transport, you should stop doing what you're doing immediately and eat at Gauchos.  Raise your children tomorrow.  A good job will wait for you.  It is awesome.  What more needs to be said.    It's as good as restaurant like it can be, and that's really good.  Just go. Put down the tablet, phone, or computer and go...

Okay, I'm paid by the word count (umm, you're not paid at all) so I better start padding.  Gaucho's is an economical idea made even better by amazing food delivered in an amazing way.  Meat is brought to your table skewered on a sword.  That is awesome, as awesome as ocelots, King Ghidorah, and...well, the universe.  I mean it's not exactly a sword, it's a skewer. But it's three feet long, solid steel, with a sharp point, so when I claim it sword-like, enough to proxy in pinch, I believe I'm on solid ground on the claim.  The menu is brilliant in its simplicity, with barely a dozen options. Really, it's just one, the seven meats. That's right, seven meats-rump steak, garlic top sirloin, rosemary pork loin, gaucho sausage, herbed chicken wings, Parmigiano beef and spicy garlic brisket.  It's a proper comparison equating those with the seven summits--the highest mountains on each of the continents, and seriously almost an esteemed achievement.  The sweats kick in about half-way through, and you feel like you're about to run out of oxygen, but you soldier on.  Why?  Because they're there!

Okay, seriously, Gaucho is fantastic in its simplicity, a chain or franchise would muddle the waters with complex ideas and padded, compromised menus.  This has one idea--a salad bar saddled with BBQ meat brought to the table via sword delivery.  You are presented with a two-colored cow-shaped card.  As long as one side is up, the meat will keep flowing to your table.  When you've had enough, flip it over to stop the line.  Simple.  I challenge everyone to finish, because they are all worth it, especially if fortunate to arrive before the lunch rush, insuring you'll have first cut.  And I usually hate salad bars.  I find any place requiring the same level of plexi-protection as what guards the Pope from assassination is probably not for me.  If food is locked away behind an inch of Formica, I generally move on.  This was good, and attractive, not just for a salad bar, not in the way we compliment ugly children, legitimately appealing.  Like the baguettes on wooden boards with an inviting knife for people to cut.  The varieties of salad ranged from the simple to the sublime.  It's after you've taken your filled plate to your table does the journey begin and the first sword delivered.  

They shave, you pinch with your tongs, and they give you a moment before returning again.  You can say no to anything offered, and can have repeats of what you like the most. So yeah, I was not a huge fan of anything with bones still in place, so sorry chicken.  The beef however, was astounding as were the sausages.  Between servings, you can take in the adorable restaurant, shockingly upmarket considering the cuisine.  I especially liked the fire hazard of a central chandelier. Seriously, whose ideas was this?  It had to have been intentional--with seven rustic bulbs mounted on the outer rim of a wagon wheel; each bulb's lengthy cable wound clumsily around the central pillar until plugged into its own socket in the ceiling.  If you saw that in your friend's house, you would mock it, the result of an insane DIY projects no architect in his right mind would endorse.  This had to have been intentional, with the eight power plugs and the forty feet of cables wrapped around the pillar.  No no, don't cut them, just wind them maniacally around the center.  It's so obvious, it had to be deliberate, so in a way, it's also kind of brilliant.  If this was a crappy Canadian pub only serving hot wings and beer nuts located in the demilitarized zone of Prince George, you would shake your head and walk out.  Here, it's adorable.

Did I mention the meat is served on a sword?  You still think I'm joking--the skewer is not a rod with a point--It has a flat edge and fuller.  It's a friggin' sword.  And at $20 at head during lunch time, it's a steal.  The staff was awesome, the décor was funky and functional.  That's it, just go.  Gaucho skirted possible negative stereotypes and created a great location and one worthy of anyone's money.  Go now.

{"text":"I went here a couple of weeks ago and the food is amazing. 
The staff, host, servers and managers were fantastic. 
My daughter ran wild and they were so accommodating to us. We took turns in taking her outside to allow her to blow of steam. 
Everything was exceptional, delicious food and fantastic service."}
{"text":"The salad bar and the Brazilian cocktail, Caipirinha, both get two thumbs up.  It's unfortunate that the cocktail is $10.  I'm not a huge beef lover or meat eater in general, but I have to say that I was impressed with the variety of beef and how well it was done.  The chicken wrapped bacon was fabulous but it showed up at the table later in the evening so I didn't have room in my belly for more than one taste.  

I like that the restaurant is a bit smaller and doesn't accommodate huge crowds.  It's a nice place to eat with a larger group.  The decor makes it feel intimate.  

The only disappointment was the kerfuffle at the end of the evening when our party of seven tried to pay the bill.  A friend noticed that the restaurant was applying GST to our 18% gratuity charge.  Gratuity should not be taxed and yet not a single employee could fix it because \"that's just what our computers do.\"  Really?  They tried to argue that all restaurants apply tax to gratuity and being that our group  of 7+ eats out regularly and are very familiar with the process, we know this isn't true.  We still got shafted in the end.  I would return, but not with a party over five because I don't want them to forcefully squeeze my pennies out of me more than once. 

The parking situation is a bit confusing.  There's parking in the lot but it appears regulated.  The hours aren't posted and you question whether or not you should be there.  We left our vehicle in the lot for over two hours on a Friday night and didn't have any trouble."}
{"text":"Been here numerous times, usually with a group of meataholics. Took about 10 guys here for a friday,noon time meat fest. Food was good as always but what's happened to your service at times it felt like we weren't even there and defiantly not seen.. Or feed. Still got a bellyful, just not like the service we've previously enjoyed. Hope you let it slip.. Ur still my  favorite place to get the meat sweats."}
{"text":"We've gone to Bolero's multiple times for their Brazilian BBQ, but we've heard from friends that they thought Gaucho's was better, so we decided to give it a try.  Besides, it's the same price at either place.

Sadly, the food at Gaucho's wasn't as good.  The salad bar was okay, but one thing my wife commented on was that everything tasted like it was going to be a great dish, until they added one ingredient that just didn't fit.  For instance, the kale salad (good) had a strong black licorice flavour added to it (bad).  It's like they tried to make it fancy by adding one additional flavour to it, but it never quite works out.  Regarding the meat, it was definitely not what I was hoping for.  All the pieces we got were well-cooked, but really, REALLY fatty.  The pork tenderloin I had on my plate was about an average serving, but when I cut off all the extra fat, I was left with a piece about a quarter the original size.  By the time the meal was over, I had half a dinner plate piled with scrap fat.  At one point they brought by meats that were cooked in \"mayonnaise and mustard\", which sounded okay, but they really tasted like meat sitting in mayonnaise and mustard.  I didn't even finish it.  After having a little bit of everything, we didn't go back for seconds, even though we really felt bad for spending so much money to get food that neither of us really enjoyed.

On the positive side, though-- the staff were all very friendly.  In fact, I'd say they were much more friendly and courteous than Bolero's.  Our waiter was extremely friendly and always had my drink filled (unlike at Bolero's).

So, our final decision as we left the restaurant: \"Well, now we know.\"  In the future, when we're wanting Brazilian BBQ and we're willing to spend that much money, we'll be going to Bolero's."}
{"text":"I have dined here on a number of occasions, for both lunch and dinner and with a variety of individuals so right off the bat, I trust it. The service, the food and the environment is consistent and I respect and appreciate that in a restaurant. I am rather particular when it comes to my protein - some would refer to my quirks as \"picky\" but the fact is I don't like the fatty bits, too much blood, bone, gristle, or funny looking pieces of meat. That's probably why Gaucho doesn't get a higher rating from me. I'm not a big meat eater. But damn, what I get here convinces me to come back so they are doing something well. The variety of meat; pork, chicken, beef, liver, and within that selection a sampling of so many - chicken wrapped in bacon, chicken wings, sirloin tip, lamb, etc. Meat done to perfection! The \"salad\" bar is more than salad and has hot and cold items that accompany the heavy protein delightfully. There are Brazilian favourites; manioc flour mix of herb and meat, black beans, rice and a fresh hearts of palm salad and my favourite, the cucumber/pineapple salad. I certainly recommend this Brazilian BBQ - with one loved one or a group of friends."}
{"text":"Gaucho is definitely one of my go-to restaurants when I am looking for a homely and satisfying meal. The decor is rugged - in coherence with the name - but the ambiance is warm due to the friendly and attentive staff.
The variety of meats is what usually defines Brazilian BBQ, but every now and then I would actually forgo the rodizio and only eat from the salad bar, which is also an option on the menu. 
The meat is juicy and flavourful and the salad bar offers fresh greens and my favourite black bean beef stew.

I believe the prices are also very reasonable for all-you-can-eat.

The only main criticism I would have is the lack of consistency in the quality of the meats and service. Although neither has ever actually been \"bad\", there is that occasional moment where a certain dish, or meat, and attentiveness of the staff would be slightly below its usual standard. For example, the parmesan beef could sometimes be overcooked, or the bean stew a little more diluted than usual, and a server could take too long to bring the cheque.

Nonetheless, my experiences at Gaucho on a whole have been great. I would definitely keep coming back!"}
{"text":"The beef is good, but the service is not.. Even when the restaurant was not busy when we went there, it took them a long time between every kind of beef they served...

In addition, I think the salad bar is small for a Brazilian restaurant..."}
{"text":"I made a reservation for Gaucho online for Sunday Feb 6, 2011 for my husbands birthday. We had the lunch buffet that was $16.99 each, we certainly got a good bang for our buck. Considering it was Superbowl Sunday it was pretty busy in there. But we were seated right away. The parking lot was packed, we had to park in the Bubble's parking lot up the street. 

7 different meats, all of which were very tasty.  Service was good. The salads and sides were so good. The mashed potatoes, and the basa stewed in coconut curry were amazing! We were stuffed. We tried some kind a Brazilian soft drink that was kind of good but not worth $4. We would go back again."}
{"text":"This is one of the best dining experiences I've had in a long time.  Similar food as Pampas in Edmonton, but better.
The food was amazing, and the service second to none.  
Very warm and relaxed atmosphere.  Will stop to eat here every time we are in Calgary!"}
{"text":"I've been to a Brazillian BBQ before, but never in Canada.

Wave after wave of fantastic meat, and usually a monthly feature or two, is paraded around on skewers, carts, etc. I was luckily enough to visit when they were serving barbequed Asian pears, they blew my little mind. 

As long as the indicator on your table says \"bring it on\" they'll come buy about every 2 minutes with some kind of food. If it's not what you want, wave them off, eventually something good will come around.

Lamb, Asian Pears, Steak, Chicken Hearts (everyone was raving about them, I found them to be rubbery little sacs), were just some of the 13 dishes that were in rotation this night.

If you leave hungry, see a doctor."}
{"text":"I've never been to a rodizio before, but I'll say it was an interesting experience.

First of all, bring your appetite and a pretty large chunk of cash.  This place will feed you until you're blue in the face with delicious, authentic Brazilian cuisine.  It was quite different from anything I've experienced before, which made it fun and exciting.

Right off the bat the chef came out with giant skewers of meat, deliciously cooked to perfection and sliced right onto our plate.  And it didn't stop.  We were continuously served the meat until we couldn't possibly force anymore into our bellies.  Now, I'm not usually the biggest meat lover, but man was this stuff good!

A cool thing about this place is that they actually recommend drinks that would fit appropriately with the meal.  I didn't actually go for the drink they were selling, but that's because I was craving a good ol' beer!

The service is great at this place and the food is fantastic.  I would recommend this place for an interesting date night, or just a nice different meal with the fam."}
{"text":"I like Rodizio, Brazilian BBQ!  From the moment we entered the restaurant to the end of the meal, we were treated with wonderful customer service.  The waitress we had was always smiling and pleasant which added to our delicious lunch.  The lunch rodizio costs $22/person.  It includes the sides and salad bar.  The salad bar was so freshly made.  I particularly liked the cucumber & pineapple salad with a hint of mint.  It introduced coolness to the hot food side items of fragrant and fluffy white rice, black bean beef stew, spicy green bean.  The carvers started to come out with their tall skewers of meat.  There was garlic top sirloin, garlic steak, rump steak, parmesan beef, chicken wings, sausage, pork loin, chicken hearts - so many types of meat!!  The meat came out piping hot, medium rare for the beef items.  You never can say no to garlic!  Chicken hearts was a delight!  I have never had bbq chicken hearts that taste this good!!  The sausage was tender.  I like all the meat items but my faves are rump steak and parmesan beef.  

Oh yes!  I almost forgot about the fresh warm baguettes at the buffet table.  Don't forget the 2 types of butter - spicy butter and the garlic butter. The garlicy butter was so good with that fresh bread!

I also saw Gaucho has Guarana on their menu.  It's Brazil's fave soft drink with caffeine in it.  I didn't try it but have heard about this drink.  

The restaurant was about 80% full when we left.  The parking lot was pretty full when we came back.  I wish there was more parking spaces.  If you want to get to the restaurant, make sure you go via MacLeod Trail North and turn into the entrance of the tall white bldg, just before the carwash on 58th Avenue."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is fantastic and the staff are very friendly. Once they start bringing the food it is fast and furious. You won't leave with an empty stomach that is for sure. We really liked the garlic steak, as well as the sausage. It is a reasonable price for really great food."}
{"text":"The staff is A-one.  The Parmesan beef is A-one.  Compared to other Brazilian barbeques I've been to in BC (where's my floor show, dude???  wadda mean, you don't have alligator???) it was a disappointment. 
Why have people make reservations and then have them wait at the front for 1/2 hour for a table?  They did offer us drinks while waiting, which I had assumed would be served at a bar of some sort while waiting for our table.  Nope, we had to make sure the in-out traffic past the hostess stand didn't cause us to spill.  
And maybe because it was a large group and we were among the last on the \"meat rounds\" I found alot of the meat a little too well done and a little dry and chewy.  After dinner, I had a \"special\" 3-liqueur coffee that tasted like...weak coffee.  Not eye-popping decor or heart-stopping food, the only thing it had going on (other than the staff) was the \"quantity over quality\" menu."}

1. service(five stars for this). Everyone was super nice and friendly.
2. Food... Very good.  Fav was pork loin, lamb and Parmesan beef.  I wished they served the grilled pineapple.  I thought the meat flavour was better here than bolero but less choices.  More authentic here.

No matter which Brazilian BBQ in town you choose you can't lose.  

I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Bring your stretchy pants!  This place is amazing.  So many meats,  so little time.  The concept is unique,  they bring meat, announce what it is, you say yes and enjoy it.  If you need to slow down for a bit, let them know you'll pass and they move on.  The meat was all very tasty. The chicken wrapped in bacon was one of my favourites.  The salad bar was great too.  The service was good and the place was clean."}
