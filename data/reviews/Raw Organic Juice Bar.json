{"text":"I sent my husband over to pick up some juices for a weekend juice fast (I was under the weather and did not want to do the juicing myself). 
Great flavor combinations in Clean Checkup, Carrot Top and Cool As a Cucumber. I got the large sizes and sipped on them all day. I felt much better afterwards and appreciate that I have a great place like this so close to home. Will be going there myself soon to try the smoothies and wheatgrass shots!"}
{"text":"Tasty smoothies, healthy, fresh made and variety on the menu. Prices are pretty fair compared to other juice bars. I'm not too knowledgeable on health foods but my questions get answered. Military and Veteran discount available. Super friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Delicious high quality smoothies that keep you healthy! I usually order the strawberry fix or first date, I order with coconut milk instead of the rice milk. Love this place, just wish they offered larger drinks. Their largest drink is still not a meal replacement, more like a snack."}
{"text":"I used to go to Whole Foods all the time to get my smoothies. This place is the real deal. Expect to pay a bit more compare to other places but it's worth it. Service is always good."}
{"text":"wonderful juice bar! really love the \"rich girl\" ,the elixirs are ALL great! love this place"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!! The fruit is so fresh and the strawberry fix smoothie is great! I order it all the time. I'm happy that finally there's something healthy I'm obsessed with"}
{"text":"I love Acai bowls and was happy to find a new spot close to work.  This is a cute little place with lots of juices and other organic hipster stuff!  I got the option 1 bowl, and it was good; but not $10 for a bowl good. My strawberries looked a little bit dried out and there was like 2 total cut on top, with maybe a half a banana and some sprinkled granola on top.  Nothing spectacular or extra appealing to warrant such a hefty price!  I'll stick to the Fresche in Mesa for my bowls.  Also, I noticed you can buy roughly 4oz of organic beet salad for $7... If you're into that sort of thing..."}
{"text":"This place makes the BEST açaí bowls I have ever had... the homemade granola is everything!! There juices and smoothies are also amazing and everything is fresh organic.  Love it!"}
{"text":"I frequent here after the gym for a meal replacement smoothie. My favorite is All Summer Long, it has a very nice chai flavor. The acai bowls are also pretty tasty! It is a bit on the expensive side since they use organic produce but I prefer Sip to most other juice bars in the area."}
{"text":"First time coming here, and first time ever trying an acai bowl. They definitely set the standards high....  Great bowl! I got bowl #2 and I love it"}
{"text":"Great little spot and incredibly friendly and knowledgeable staff. Everytime I start to feel little sick I get the Superman and it's usually gone within a day. Highly recommend this place and I've been to a lot of juice bars around"}
{"text":"As i said on our emails. This information would had been helpful if it had been said to me before i swiped my card. I would simply had not made the purchase. Your omissions of possible side effects was  negligent and unprofessional as a business that serves food you are obligated to provide this information to your customers before they swipe their cards. And no i did not get that email talking about possible side efects. I was ask if i had gotten it the 2 days i went over to pick up the drinks. and i said no i did not get that email regarding side effects. Still it was never sent to me. 
I still feel your business did me wrong and should have gotten a refund due to your negligence and lack of information. as of the free smoothies thank you but i had a horrible day of cramps vomiting diarrhea and weaknesses to last me for a life time. I will never drink or buy anything sold or prepared by this business. Thank you for your offer and i hope you guys learn from your mistakes and inform your customers from now on. As a food provider business you have that responsibility. And must take responsibility when some one gets sick due to your drinks and lack of information and not refuse a refund when a refund is the only way to make up for your lack of information and un professionalism. ."}
{"text":"My grandmother and I have been to every juice bar in the valley. My grandmother juices daily and is on a dairy free& gluten free diet, so when I heard about this place opening up we were super excited!

First off, lets talk about the aesthetics of the juice bar. It is so cute and clean inside! They also have free wifi while you  are sipping on your drink!! I love how you can see them making your drink right in front of you, so you know exactly what is going into your drink.

The owner (Sam) was super knowledgeable about all of their ingredients. Since, my grandmother knows pretty much everything about juicing she was pleasantly surprised that Sam knew much more than her!! He help both of us navigate the menu and pick delicious drinks. 

I had the \"Super Bass\" and grandma had the \"Rich Girl\". We both loved our drinks. We are so excited to make this our weekly grandmother and granddaughter date spot."}
{"text":"Great location, tasty juices, and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I just purchased my first three-day cleanse from Sip! I cannot wait to evaluate how I'm feeling afterwards - I've heard nothing but good things. 

I want to take a moment to commend the staff at Sip. This being my first cleanse, Alex was so willing to talk me through each day. Even more, she helped me walk to my car with all the juice to be sure I wouldn't spill! WOW! What outstanding customer service."}
{"text":"Highly recommend... Best Juice Bar out there! Great friendly staff, awesome variety of drinks & they taste amazing!! Wish I could afford to have them make my BL&D everyday! ... I recommend their week cleanse challenge as well! It's was a great way to restart my gut & feel great from the inside out!"}
{"text":"I am hooked! My friend and I ventured to Raw Organic Juice and were amazed! The owner gave us an amazing run down of everything and answers every question we had! We are both big juicers and my friend is celiac sprue (allergy to gluten). Every thought and concern was well answered. The rawnola and raw balls were amazingly delicious as well we're the açai bowls and meal replacement smoothies. I already can't wait to go back this week. This place has a very unique identity that sets it miles apart from any other folks who claim health or vegetarianism. Everyone who works here is all in and truly believes in what they make and sell. They have an amazing deal for 12$ for 20, it is worth it to get you in the door and completely hooked!"}
{"text":"Visit this place often and love their selections. Have a number of juice shots to choose from and great smoothie options. There is something for everyone, even coffee alternative options that taste amazing. A better value for the quality."}
{"text":"Love this place!  When I go, I always get the meal replacement smoothies.  They're filling and fresh tasting.  The two girls that I see working there are always super friendly."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place!!!  So yummy and healthy and clean (the food and the place!). Sure, it would be nice to not be as pricey, but if I'm willing to spend $$ at Starbucks on a latte that's not good for me, I'm willing to spend money on this juice/food which is like gold for my body!  Plus, how cool that they have the Groupon for spend $12 for $20 worth."}
{"text":"OMG! This place is like heaven on earth! RAW & ORGANIC! How much better can you get than that. I was overwhelmed with the menu but the staff was very helpful. So many protein packed flavorful options! 

I ordered the First Date, which is a lunch replacement smoothie. Soooooo tasty! My mother was very pleased with her organic coffee replacement drink. We will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Third time, still delicious as the first. Honestly, I'm not the biggest juicer but sometimes, you just need something fresh and full of fruits and veggies. I've had the good vibrations twice, the help! Elixir and the blueberry meal replacement. I've been incredibly pleased with all of them. 

The owner is great! Helpful and has great suggestions based off of what you are looking to help with your juice (gotta cold? Ask him) he's been there each time I've been in. Lastly, they don't waste space with ice! It's just a full glass of fresh organic juice."}
{"text":"Such an amazing little place! I went with my mom while we were in town, and the girls working there were so sweet. I got the gladiator and took out the maca and agave and it was so good! My mom got the clean up green juice and she loved it as well. They have a great menu and choices of things to choose from-smoothies, juices, açaí bowls, etc. Totally recommend going here!"}
{"text":"Ok I'll admit I have never had anything remotely like what I tasted here. A new year, a new experience!  The drink had coconut milk and other things, it was called \"spicy date\". It was surprisingly delicious, to me. I asked a few questions about the 3 day raw detox they have and they explained it very well. It consists of 2 drinks and a soup. 1 drink for breakfast and 1 for lunch the soup for dinner. Along with a 2 special granola cookies(which are really yummy). I thought  (just my opinion) it was a little pricey $149(I think that's it) $99 on special. It's 3 days worth of detox meals they prepare for you, that may be a good price...I'll think on that some more. Really all in all...great little place, nice people who work there and I will be coming back. Thank you for the experience RAW organic juice bar!!"}
{"text":"Such a yummy place! Loved the strawberry liquid lunch. If I lived right next to this place I would be here twice a day"}
{"text":"I had a doctors appointment nearby and was checking out options in the area to get something for breakfast; Raw Organic Juice Bar seemed like it would hit the spot! When I walked in, it smelled earthy ... odd, I know, but it was because of all the fresh ingredients they had. After a glance at the menu, I had absolutely no idea what to get. Someone working there was quick in asking me what I was looking for.

If you're curious - their liquid lunch replacements are the more filling smoothies whereas the traditional smoothies are \"healthier\" since they are not as filling but are made with greens, and the juices are exactly what you'd expect as they are packed with greens and other veggies.

I ended up selecting a liquid lunch replacement - the Nutty Monkey which was made of rice milk, bananas, dates, vanilla, hemp seeds, and almond butter. I think it tasted just about how I thought it would ... mostly like bananas and almond butter, but it definitely had some sweetness from the dates. The only thing was that I wish it had more of a thick smoothie consistency instead of a milky consistency.

Either way, the staff was great and the smoothie was good. When in the area again, I'd definitely stop by for another smoothie or maybe try out a juice."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now.  The 1st time i had a delicious smoothie I can't recall the name... something with lots of coconut, the kids had a delicious carrot based juice...
This time I enjoyed a lotus and hubby tried a strawberry smoothie I can't recall the name of.  It's always great when the hubby likes something coz he is usually a meat and potatoes type of guy. 
I look forward trying otger great juices and smoothies.
The service is always spectacular.  The employees are always happy and make nice conversion.  They greet everyone with a smile. 
Love it here."}
{"text":"The smoothie was awesome! Prices pretty steep.. 8 bucks for a small? But I understand that organic and raw are pricey items. BUT, what is free is smiles..and let me tell you, I did not get not even ONE smile. I said thank you on my way and no response. Weird people. Too bad because it's good. Head to whole foods instead."}
{"text":"Raw Organic used to be Sip Organic - which the owner decided to take the reigns and part out on their own! Way to go for entrepreneurship! Anyway you will notice that all the names have changed but the ingredients are pretty much the same. Thank goodness they are here to stay!

My favorites are the First Date and the Nutty Monkey. Both are very similar except First Date has the good greens: spinach. Your folate, iron and fiber!! Oh yes...this is the one to boost your health!  

First Date: greens, celery, rice milk, banana, dates, vanilla, maca, hemp seeds, almond butter.  I love a as a smoothie snack. Great flavor and enough greens. A way to feed your kids some greens maybe?? 16oz $7.75, 20oz $9.75. 

Nutty Monkey: like the First Date but with no greens and no celery. This is considered a meal replacement. It's thick but I don't know if I can justify it as a meal replacement. Maybe a meal additional. 16oz $7.95, 20oz $9.95. 

Many other options to choose from, as well as their fresh juices, acai bowls and elixirs. Love there colored chalk writing menus. Good staff and location."}
{"text":"Sort of a hidden gem!! I love this place. Everyone is super friendly, the ingredients are fresh, and it's always yummy!!! Definitely one of my go to places."}
{"text":"A little pricey for the size. I got a strawberry smoothie, I was told that this was one of the more popular drinks. Overall it was ok, a typical smoothie. The employees were super nice but I doubt if I'll return. I can get the same smoothie from Panera Bread for half the price."}
{"text":"Best of the best.  Raw & 100% organic.  You don't get that at ANY other juice shop /bar.  Customer friendly tasty juice blends.  Pure medicine.   We live in the age of information.  If you still go to your doctor and refuse to eat your medicine you'll never be cured by your doctor.  Again,  EAT YOUR MEDICINE! It's fitting that this place is right next door to Chandler regional, where they pump you with pills for profit.  Do your own research...."}
{"text":"Every time I visit Chandler I look forward to my butter-finger shake.. I literally run there as soon as they open for business for the day. It's so good! The staff are always super friendly and already know me & what I like. There's something special about walking into a place where everyone knows you. If you're ever in the chandler area go check them out.. you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"They have the best customer service and amazingly delicious acaci bowls and juices. They also have delivery service.  This is my new favorite lunch and weekend breakfast place."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time and had a great experience. They had a good selection of vegetable and fruit juice blends and smoothies. The staff was friendly and the atmosphere was nice. Very clean store and everything tasted fresh. I had the Morning Glory and it was good."}
{"text":"I love this place there pretty fast the only issue that I would have with them as I get the same smoothie every time and it tastes different every time I think that everyone needs to be trained again on their recipes"}
{"text":"Great \"First Date\" to start the morning.  Definitely will be back each time I'm in town.   Looking forward to trying the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Went here today with a friend to try it out. I got the Dr Feel Good without celery and she got the Rich Girl. The Rich girl was pretty bad, but mine was okay. The problem with this style of juicing is it gets rid of all the nutrients and leaves you with jut the stripped sugary juice, so it doesn't have much value. Another issue is this place only has 16oz and 20oz sizes, which for some, can be just way too much. They need an 8oz size. Overall, this place has blah combinations, too large of sizes and is a bit on the pricey side."}
{"text":"Everything I've had on the menu is incredible! I think I've been every day since they opened  my recommendations - purple rain, over the rainbow or rich girl! 

On top of amazing ingredients, the customer service and atmosphere is awesome. Bumpin good tunes and free wifi. If they sold wine I might never leave!"}
{"text":"First time here.  First time for a smoothie and available bowl. Everything was absolutely delicious and super healthy."}
{"text":"Visiting for a weekend and I searched for an organic juice bar, so happy I found this place! It's like heaven on earth. I made sure to stop in every morning of my trip to try something new, and everything was amazing and the girls are very sweet. Great place!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, wonderful juices. They helped my son create a juice that would feel better on his freshly de-tonsiled throat!"}
{"text":"So glad to have this juice/smoothie bar close to home, love that everything is organic.  The staff is friendly, knowledgeable, and very upbeat, the store is spotless and cheerfully decorated. 

I really enjoyed the 'Rich Girl' and 'Everything's Gonna Be Alright' juices and 'Rocket Man' shot. The menu explains the health benefits of the various offerings and includes KCal info which is very much appreciated. Scott loved the Acai Option #1 Bowl, it was his first time trying one and I'm THRILLED he enjoyed it. (Though he thinks Acai looks like poop;)

Can't wait to be back in AZ, am a total fan, and we will be regulars for sure. I have my eye on the smoothies with hemp protein as post workout meal replacements. 

* Reasonable prices, variety which should entice anyone *

** offers Reboot Detox juices **"}
{"text":"I simply love this place!! The customer service, the quality of ingredients in every menu item.  They really do a great job!!"}
{"text":"Raw and completely ORGANIC!!! I would recommend this to any conscious and aware raw vegan or vegetarian. If you want to cleanse  or rehydrate the right way i would always recommend RJB if your in the area. Quality!!!"}
{"text":"So delicious! I had the opportunity to try the Valley Girl juice last year (greens, cucumber, apple, celery, ginger, lemon, cinnamon, cayenne and honey) and I still remember how delicious it was. I think it is because they fill each drink with so many amazing ingredients. I visited the Raw Organic Juice Bar today and decided to try something new. I tried the Gladiator (coconut water, coconut meat, banana, agave, cocoa, maca, hemp seed, almond butter). It was packed with flavor yet light and refreshing. 

The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable about their products. 

I recommend this to anyone that wants a nutritious treat. You will love it."}
{"text":"I used a Living Social deal to try this place out. We ordered a meal replacement smoothie, I forget the name and a regular smoothie from the middle menu. 

As a meal replacement smoothie, there isn't enough calories in it to justify the price. My drink wasn't thick like you would think a smoothie would be. It was some what creamy due to the almond butter, but not really seemed watery because it seem like there was no ice.  It was tasty, but for the price I rather make my own at home than pay for the convenience. 

This place is aight. I'd come back if the mood hit me right. But I won't be a regular."}
{"text":"Such a great juice bar! I love that I literally live right up the road from it. The girls here are super sweet and always so helpful. My go to is always the Early Riser with a splash of coconut water. My son who is a fanatic of Acai bowls loved option #1. Definitely my go to for our juices."}
{"text":"It was pretty good wish they had more choices for meal replacement drinks and wish they would show the calories and carbs for their drinks. Most all of the drinks have a fruit in Them not so good for diabetic people."}
{"text":"Popped in for our first time this morning. Staff was super kind. I am dairy and nut free due to allergies. They recommended to swap the almond butter for hemp seed. Both of the smoothies we ordered tasted great! We will be back."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place for some time and I'm so glad I finally have. Not only is this place legit, the staff are warm and friendly and the place smells wonderful!"}
{"text":"Before u go to whole foods or any other place that juices make sure u come to this place . They taste the best . I've done had some juices from whole foods and I would just pour it out . This place probably deserve 5 stars but I want to go there for a few times to see if it remain the same . It really depends on the person making it and how clean the machine is . Idk just my guess lol . I'm heading there again as we speak !!!"}
{"text":"This juice bar is the best! Whatever they recommend is always on point. Downside is a little pricey, however, it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Delish!!!!! I found this place 4 days in to my juicing and I absolutely love it! Their juice recipes are delightful. They don't leave a large layer of foam on the top either! I'm always excited to arrive and always feel better when I leave than when I arrived. I give this place 5 hearts!"}
{"text":"Was visiting from Dallas and this place made my week wonderful! Great staff and wonderful juice! I had smoothies, juice, and a bowl and everything was fresh and DELICIOUS!  Prices are a little high but worth the quality. They run daily specials and have online ordering. I stopped in each morning for breakfast and an afternoon pick me juice to take along to work. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is awesome. Everyone is so nice and helpful. The clean Checkup juice is amazing as is the daily dose shot. Great for anti-inflammatory and immune system. The #2 available bowl is also amazing! We were going to share one and decided it was too good and got our own."}
{"text":"I had this place bookmarked for a while and finally checked it out. Loved it!
Megan was awesome. She had a ton of orders and even still she moved quickly and answered our many questions about the different items. 
The menu had lots of options. She helped me customize my acai bowl, I think we ended up doing acai, almond milk, banana, almond butter, spinach and then their delicious rawnola, banana and strawberry on top. Yummy!
I ordered a large blueberry bliss (added pineapple or strawberry, can't remember) for my sons and she split it in to two cups. I got about one sip before they devoured them. 
We also got a little cookie dough bite. It was so good!
Wonderful place. Especially for those that appreciate quality. 
I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went in for a Hot Shot because I've been under the weather and it cleared my sinuses right out, I feel a lot better. Also got the \"butterfinger\" smoothie and it was really good! Very friendly staff that offered suggestions."}
{"text":"Wonderful juice bar! Staff here are always really friendly and helpful. A lot of interesting juices and smoothie concoctions. I always get the first date and it's absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"Amazing organic health medicine!! Amazing what healing powers the right juice does!"}
{"text":"More a review for my wife than for me, but my experience exceeded expectations as well. She loves the Dr. Feelgood with beets added. Outstanding customer service, the owner knew who I was buying the drink for by the order and asked if we had our baby yet. A little pricey of course, but that's to be expected at an organic juice bar (it's surprising that some juice bars aren't organic)."}
{"text":"I go here at least once a week! All the staff is great and their juices, smoothies, and acai bowls are all good! So happy to have this place in a convenient spot in Chandler that is easy to access and has plentiful parking."}
{"text":"My juice was simply divine. I cannot wait to come back. Thank you for being organic in a pesticide ridden world. Thank you for being here."}
{"text":"This was the cuties Juice Bar.  I ordered a bowl that had really tasty rawnola, fresh blueberries ( my favorite fruit) and the acaí base was heaven. The service was amazing.  Megan had quite a few people to serve at one time, and handled it beautifully. She made everyone feel welcomed and was really informative on the nutritional value. 
She made the wait time very short, even though there were about 11 orders at one time.  Nice job, Megan and Raw, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Found this place a few days ago and decided to stop in and grab a quick smoothie. The place is cute and quaint. I ordered a strawberry smoothie with protein, they didn't offer protein as an add on . They let me know that protein was in the smoothie in a different form I think it was flaxseed or something. I was given the option of 16oz or 20oz and I went with 20oz. The 20oz smoothie was around $11!!!! I was shocked! The smoothie tasted decent but due to price I will not be returning!"}
{"text":"Love finding healthy spots to eat like this. Great variety of choices & everything had amazing flavor. Tried the kale salad, beet salad, all 3 flavored of cookie dough bites, valley girl juice & strawberry fix. Of course I had my very picky daughter with me to share it so I wouldn't get overly stuffed & she loved it all also. We will be back."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've come here and the second time I'm impressed. The ladies are very welcoming and made exactly what I wanted. I was complicated because I make my smoothies a certain way and they nailed it. I am trying to go all organic and they make it easy. I'm coming back for their home made peanut butter soon, just as long as the guy working there doesn't eyeball me again for making a complicated order. It is also expensive so don't forget your wallet!"}
{"text":"I completed the 3day detox.... So easy and so good! I love a good easy healthy smoothie for a great price. If you're looking to detox, this is the place!"}
{"text":"Last week I did the 5 Day Detox and it was awesome!  One of the things I discovered is that I eat way more in a day than my body truly needs.  There were times during the day when I would have normally had a snack out of habit, but wasn't truly hungry.  I loved starting  each day with a green smoothie.  It was plenty of nutrients to get me to lunch and my energy throughout the day was sky high.  There were times I did feel a bit hungry in the afternoon, but that was just my reminder to drink more water...after I did, the hunger was satisfied.  Overall, I lost 5 1/2 lbs in 5 days.  I really felt the biggest difference in my stomach...nice and flat.  This is the right way to do a detox -  raw, organic and with whole foods!"}
{"text":"This is \"my drink stop.\" Delicious, fresh, and friendly. The owner is really friendly and her staff all seem to be the same. If you know me I am not the healthiest--love my sugar and other \"evil\" foods. But this place is pulling me the other direction.  I really do feel amazing after having one of their drinks. I never remember what I got the last time, so I just ask the employee to give me their favorite. So far-they have all been a hit!"}
{"text":"We have stopped in a few times to get juices. The staff was very nice offering us to try a  shot for free which was very nice of them. I really like all different types of juices here good prices and full of different ingredients that have you feeling healthy and more importantly hydrated."}
{"text":"Beautiful organic juice bar with amazing customer service.  So many selections it would take months to go through them but after just two mornings of having one of their green juices for breakfast I was buzzing with energy all day and into the evening."}
{"text":"Excellent juice bar, products, service, quality are top rated! Small family owned shop"}
{"text":"Love this place, especially the ButterFinger meal replacement drink.  It's really good and genuinely satisfying.  They're friendly and willing to help you pick a drink if it's your first time or if you're just looking for something different."}
{"text":"I've been waiting and waiting for Sip to open! Finally the day has come. Where do I start about this wonderful, fantastic, deliciousness place! 

Well I guess I can start with the wonderful staff of Sip. They are so nice and friendly. Honestly they will stand and go through item by item, ingredient by ingredient. And tell you the benefit of everything. Not like going into Whole Foods and just hearing uhhh it's good for you! They know the real true reason  why their stuff is so good for you. Everything in here is true pure 100% organic! No fake stuff here! 

There is a variety of items to pick from. Juices, smoothies, make your own, açaí bowls, shots. They make everything right there so you won't be seeing naked juice or anything like that!!! It's a little pricey because you are paying for quality!!!!!! Remember that healthy costs if you want unhealthy there's Dunkin up the street. However you won't find nice people, awesome flavorful food there so try Sip and you'll love it!!!"}
{"text":"Love this juice bar. I stop in after Pure Barre quite often for a meal replacement or green juice. Everything I have tried is delicious and the employees are always super helpful. It's a little pricey but when you think about the quality of the ingredients it makes sense. You get what you pay for...if you want cheap crap go to jamba juice."}
{"text":"Fire in motion. 

This place is legitimate. I mean the name alone should give it away, \"Raw Organic Juice Bar\" they obviously know what they're doing. 

Everything we have tasted has been great so far, vegans should know that places like these are storehouses of nutrient dense foods.  Babies even like the drinks and they're super healthy for all parties consuming them.  

Each concoction has been thought out and mastered, ranging from great tasting to great healing with flavors all in between but each seeking a certain beneficial outcome. 

Thanks for all of the great quality drinks you put out!  I'm coming back for my 2 cookie doughs I didn't get ; p love this place and I wish you (the owner) and the staff great success. I hope the word gets spread about these wonderful products! 

See you soon.  

P.s I know the menu can seem expensive but check out the deal they have on Yelp (it's a good one) and learn what each fruit or vegetable does in restoring different body parts and organs into alignment. After you do this research you will learn the value and see that it's actually a wonderful life long investment."}
{"text":"This place looks so healthy just by looking at their fresh fruits topped in silver bowls!  I decided to try one of their \"Substantial Meal Replacements.\"  It was more of a dessert/snack for me after Pure Barree.  I tried the 20 oz \"Don't Stop Believin\" (nut milk, dates, banana, almond butter, maca, hemp protein - $9.75).  Such a healthy dessert-like smoothie, but it's quite healthy!  I love the creaminess and guiltless taste of it!  

If you want more of a chocolate taste, try \"Superbass\" (coconut water and meat, banana, hemp protein, macs, almond butter, cacao, agave - $9.75).  That one is also a dessert in itself.  Healthy non-guilty pleasure!  

They ask for your phone number so you can earn points!  Every 100 points (or $100) earns you $5 towards your next drink!  

And - the service here - 2 thumbs up for being friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"I'm a smoothie/juice fanatic so I love looking for a great juice place that sticks to healthy produce as opposed to fruit juices and smoothies mixes. Nekter is usually my go to, however I was driving home and I saw Raw Organic Juice Bar. The name itself is appealing because it sounds healthy. And if it truly is organic, as a nutrition major, I totally support that, so in I went. As soon as you come in, you see super cute trendy decor. They make the menu so cute and appealing and you can see all the ingredients they're using right in front of you. They make your smoothie, juice or acai bowl right infront of you. They also offer plenty of explanation behind their recipes, i.e hang over cure, etc. I got the lean and green because this is the first smoothie place I've seen that offers grapefruit so it caught my attention! Overall, it's super good, smoothie places are always a tad bit expensive. I paid around 10 dollars for a 20oz smoothie, which I think is the perfect size, 16oz is too small, 24oz is too big. I'll definitely be back, whenever I'm passing through chandler!"}
{"text":"I found Sips Organic Juice Bar in January, 2015 and have been pleasantly surprised at how good their product is.  It's always fresh and each time I go in I have tried something different on their menu.  To this date I have not been disappointed with anything I've tried.  They have also been adding Raw Food to their menu.  The Kale salad is delicious but the grated beet salad is out of this world!  The staff at this place are all very knowledgeable and friendly and each time I go in there they are willing to thoroughly go over ingredients and their benefits & offer suggestions on products to try.  Their customer service is impeccable!"}
{"text":"Just went here for the first time and loved it! I got the meal replacement  smoothie for breakfast and it was the perfect way to start my day. I highly recommend the first date smoothie. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best juice bar out there! Let me preface this by saying I am not a hardcore juicer or vegan, but I do enjoy drinking fresh drinks vs soda or bottled juice. Now about the place, there are two things that really stood out to me. One is the genuine friendliness of the staff. Most juicing places I've been to have staff who are a bit pretentious. They don't smile, they make you feel out of place or even dumb when asking about the menu, etc.. The people here though were nice and didn't make me feel out of place at all. They explained the menu (which made my second and third trip much easier) and helped me find something I would enjoy. The second thing that stood out to me was the fact that they don't add ice and cheat you of your 16oz/20oz like I'm used to with other places. If you do ask, they put it in a larger cup to make sue you are still getting the amount you paid for. The place itself smells great (all the fresh fruits probably) and is clean and organized (not like a hospital, but like a drink shop or cafe you stop in while strolling the streets of London. Overall it's a great place for experienced juicers/detoxers as well as those who like a refreshing guiltless drink. And don't forget to get a punch card!"}
{"text":"Went with my best friend. She got the lotus and I got the butterfinger (it was between that or the blueberry). Both are meal replacement smoothies! It had just the right amount of peanut (?) butter in it which normally I hate in smoothies but I needed a meal!! I liked it better than the (only) protein option that Nekter juice bar (in Tempe marketplace and in Chandler) offers because theirs is wayyy too viscous."}
{"text":"Love me some raw organic juice! Trying to add more of this into my diet and it's great to have options out there!"}
{"text":"Love this cute little juice bar! I was here on business and Sip was recommended to me. Cute cafe to get some work done, friendly staff, & lots of fresh juice options. Will definitely come back if in the area! I wish more of these existed across the nation."}
{"text":"I had a great experience trying out the 3 day detox last week! I didn't feel starving or tired and liked the majority of what we were given to eat/drink. The Rawnola bar was delicious. I would like to do this detox again soon, it would probably be good for me to do once a month!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time today! I had a juice and my son had a smoothie...both delish! Very friendly staff and cute interior."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff! Picked this bio for my massage therapist at San Tan Spa and she loved it! She's also the best massage therapist there is check her out they're in the Doubletree Hilton in Gilbert."}
{"text":"This spot kind of let me down.  Don't get me wrong the space is cool and the employees are awesome but the food just was a bit underwhelming.   I was staying near by and they open early so with the great reviews I decided to buy a Yellow desk (damn spell checker Yelp Deal argg) and get $20 greenies for $14.  Sounded good so I walked in and looked over the menu and decided that a juice and açaí bowl would be perfect.  They also had a special where you could get a $2 power bar if you ordered a bowl or juice so basically I got that all for $14.   

I got the beetle  juice first and it was kind of small for $8-9 bucks but it was tasty.  It had beats and carrot ginger lemon celery and apple.  Sucked that puppy down pretty quickly before I got the açaí bowl number three that had coconut milk and strawberries with the açaí and coconut and blueberries on top.

Again I was surprised how small it looked when delivered.  It felt more like I was getting more of a gelato cup size than a bowl.  My smiley face sunk a bit but then I realized I got a Yelp deal and I want starving or anything so I would survive.  

The açaí was a bit too soft for my taste and it seemed a bit watered down, the pineapple was a little droopy. The Rawnola bar was the best part of the meal.

Overall I'm not sure I'll be back with the many juice options in Chandler.  They did have a Bloody Mary type juice that looked interesting and I may try that out sometime but the Bowls are no bueno..:("}
{"text":"Over $10 for a açaí bowl; I don't think so. I was pretty dishearten with this place. For the amount you pay for a fruit bowl it should at least have some taste. I got option #3 and it lacked flavor...and it's my assumption that the fruit was frozen and not fresh. The wait was pretty long being the only ones in the store, too. It shouldn't take 9 minutes to make a juice and two bowls. If I want a \"super food\" bowl I'm going elsewhere. The shop is clean, however and has other offerings besides juice and bowls."}
{"text":"This is a very clean very well organized juice bar. I was very happy with what I ordered I think it was something with beets, pineapple juice, and celery.  I also ordered an elixir.  I think it was called the fighter. The women working there warned me that it was very spicy. I told them not to worry I would be fine, I like spicy things. Even while they were making it the woman insisted on taking out some of the seeds of the jalapeno. 

Needless to say my elixir was not spicy at all. I appreciate their concern, but I really wanted to experience the spiciness of the drink.  I get headaches and migraines, and I think the spiciness sometimes helps them. 

I would definitely go back.  I would like to try other things. I like that they open at seven in the morning so that I could go there before work."}
{"text":"So came in and Nadia( I hope i spelt that right) greeted me and she was sweet cause i was just being picking up something not for me! But she was helpful and sweet! I have been here before and I have to tell you they updated there menu! It's a very relaxing place i am glad that it's down the street!"}
{"text":"A good juice and meal replacement for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Employees were super sweet. I got the gladiator drink it was really tasty. Got my 3 yr old child a Az kids drink. She drank it all up. Never noticed the carrots in it. Great way to get veggies in without them knowing. Lol."}
{"text":"Great place for smoothies, juices and açaí bowls, among other things. Latino lover is my favorite and those Rawnola bars are YUM."}
{"text":"I have never been to a place that almost immediately wants to know all about how they can help me, these guys were asking questions about my health and offering suggested recipes that might be both palatable and helpful to me.  What a wonderful business, the help and the management have been super accommodating."}
{"text":"Get the butterfinger! It's delicious. I've gotten it a few times and it doesn't disappoint. The staff here is really nice and everything is so fresh!"}
