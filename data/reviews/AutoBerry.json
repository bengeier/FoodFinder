{"text":"I received the boot I ordered quickly. Was very excited to put it on. However, when I went to do this something wasn't right. I informed Autoberry right away that I had received the wrong year. I own 1983 Fiat this boot would fit my old Fiat that was 1974. They would not even consider that I was correct. Just kept saying that it was 100% correct and I didn't know what I was doing. They never offered any assistance telling me this product didn't come with instructions. The only thing they offered was that they would take care of it if I took it to an upholsterer and they agreed it was wrong. So I did take it and they did agree it was wrong. Still Autoberry insisted it was correct. The 1983 not only has different hardware on the car but it is in a different spot. Their is no way for this to work. They did refund my money but not the return shipping. I felt they should pay it being that they sent me the wrong product."}
{"text":"Bought mustang convertible top June 1, 2015. Now by November 19, 2015, top is beginning to tear and is showing wear from window rubbing. AutoBerry will not stand behind their 6 year warranty. They claim to use Haartz sail cloth, but the fabric seems cheap and thin compared to the original top that lasted 10 years and was still good except for the rear window glue failing. After three calls and nearly ten emails I have given up knowing that I have been ripped off by a purveyor of junk. My mistake paying attention to the 6 year warranty advertisement. Look for a higher quality product."}
