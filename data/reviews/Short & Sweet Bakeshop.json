{"text":"Came in today since I have been curious about their cakes and was treated very rudely by the one staff at the front. Will by suggesting to others that they go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"I've been stalking this place's instagram for a while and finally took the drive out to get their ice cream sandwiches on Canada day.  Good street parking, very nice and clean place. Their ice cream sammie didn't disappoint, it's a ridiculous concoction and everyone should try at least once. Also pretty pricey, 8 dollars, but it's worth it to try once. However the home run was their monster bar.  Got some cupcakes too to take home. I was a fan of some flavors like their banana bread, very creative. However I was a bit disappointed that all 6 cupcakes I had tasted like they were not baked that day -  a little too dry, and for the price of everything stuff has to be PERFECT because there are just wayyyyyyyyy too many cupcake places to choose from. The cupcakes are ok, on the most part basic. Keep in mind like others have said here on yelp, this bakery does more American style sweets so it's sugar overload.  I would come back again to try a milkshake and get another monster bar."}
{"text":"This place is well known for their cupcakes and shakes.   I decided to try a cappuccino instead considering I was waaay to full to have anymore sweets. Not sure what to expect since I don't usually order cappuccinos but this tasted like 100% milk. No sort of coffee flavour anywhere. I would still go back just to try the cupcakes though"}
{"text":"This cafe is super nice! The decor and food is amazing, it was very easy to find and very cozy inside. It is actually quite small in there.   I ordered the valentines drink, 50 shades of pink. It was $8.75, i originally thought it would be more expensive, but for the size of thd drink i think its pretty worth it.   Overall the drink was decent, the cookies at the top were very good, while the drink itself was great, it had strawberry jelly at the bottom which was a little too sweet.   I would definitely come back another time to try their Oreo drink, the staff was super sweet and welcoming! Definitely a place everyone should go to."}
{"text":"Bad, bad, bad.  Cupcake icing is way too sweet and heavy and not worth the price at all.   Yuck!  The best cupcake on Yonge nearby is at 'Bakes & Goods'.  'The Cupcake Shoppe' comes second.  Avoid this place."}
{"text":"This was a pleasant place to stop by in my neighbourhood with a girlfriend, the decor is chic, small place but quiet and the cupcakes are fresh and delicious, I had the chocolate with vanilla (buttercream?) icing with sprinkles on top. Also I usually don't like icing on cupcakes but this one was of a high quality, I ate all of it! Pretty and delicious! Would love to try the chocolate drinks too. Definitely satisfied my sweet tooth!"}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for the first time, paid a significant cab fare to come here and we're so excited to try everything!  We came in the door and there were little to no treats.  We came right at opening assuming like most other bakeries they would be fully stocked!  We got minimum selection and for how much the treats cost it was a little disappointing.  Was so excited to find some that's comparable to Jenna Rae Cakes in Winnipeg, guess I'm still searching!"}
{"text":"Short &Sweet Bakeshop is a small yet delightful spot near Yonge and Eglington. This location was easy to find and if the area isn't busy (usually is) there is parking available on the streets for about 3$ and hour.  We ordered two chocolate cupcakes (one of them triple chocolate and the other with vanilla frosting) a croissant and two Ore-OMGs which is a specialty hot chocolate.  The Ore-OMG was definitely my favourite and the reason I will be returning hopefully in the near future. The hot chocolate was decadent but not too heavy and the toppings made it tastier and more enjoyable to munch on.  I initially decided to go for the cupcakes but they ended up not being my favourite as they were pretty ordinary as far as taste and texture were concerned.  My partner was the one who had the croissant and he said it was great and went really well with the well made latte he ordered. The croissant had a fluffy chocolate filling which he said he enjoyed.  The customer service was great - everyone was very kind and the drinks came very quickly.  This bakeshop would make a great date spot or coffee meet up, I would definitely go again soon!"}
{"text":"Holy Smokes!!!!  Probably the best butter tart that I've ever enjoyed.... excellent crema on my espresso.... people were buying cupcakes in droves from Short and Sweet. I'll try those next time!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! The decor is just adorable and it's a relatively small place so it's great for going alone or on a date. I got a hot cocoa loco, the birthday cake special, and wow it was so pretty! The toppings were delicious, (piece of cake, buttercream frosting, icing, sprinkles) but unfortunately the strawberry steamed milk wasn't as yummy. You can tell they take a lot of effort into making their drinks/baked goods look beautiful. I would like to revisit this place and try their cupcakes!"}
{"text":"This is the newly opened second location for Short & Sweet. I had the best brioche doughnut filled with an amazing vanilla bean custard! It's not overly sweet and the next time I go, I'll probably get half a dozen just for myself. Someone else there ordered a S'mores drink and it is definitely Instagram worthy.  The whole space has a light pink glow from the neon pink lights on the wall spelling out \"Butter Cream Dreams\". It's a nice quiet spot to relax and satisfy your sweet tooth. The seating is a little limited since their focus is still catering to cakes for special events.  I tried a sample of their cupcake and it is a bit too rich for my taste buds. But 5 stars for their brioche doughnut :)"}
{"text":"we came for the hot chocolates. it was so incredibly sweet, but worth it! the atmosphere of the shop is great, the employees are so nice (and just as sweet as their food). I ordered the birthday cake hot chocolate and my friend ordered the oreo one. it was so good! their icing is amazing.  Would definitely reccommend and come again!"}
{"text":"While the bakeshop has many items appealing to the eye, the desserts are not appealing to the palette.   What happened? Well the cookies are themselves excessively sweet, then you could choose to purchase a Sammie which is a layer of icing in between. Basically you taste nothing but sugar.  To me, that is not a quality dessert. ... I CAN FEEL THE SUGAR COARSING through my veins.   I also sampled a chocolate chip Sammie with chocolate icing in between, and it didnt taste particularly chocolatey.  I sampled The Monster, which is a pretty dessert bar with a mix of one too many things, rendering it a hot mess of various textures of sugar.  If you want to be able taste more to the dessert than just a pure sugar taste, go to Dufflet just up the road. ...I'm just gonna cut up the remaining pieces and give the rest to the neighborhood kids.    The only thing I can say I liked was the ganache dipped brownie. It tasted good.  Maybe I'll come by one day and try those huge hot chocolate drinks.  PS. It's just south of Yonge and Eglinton and there is street parking. They also take credit card and debit."}
{"text":"I am thrilled with the expertly created homemade pastry at Short and Sweet, Yonge Street. I order Chocolate EVERYTHING cupcakes for my adored Sister's Birthday (my Sis absolutely Luvvvvvvvvs her Chocolate!!). The cupcakes were freshly baked the same morning of her Birthday celebration and looked stunning with the decorations superbly adorning each one. Most importantly, the 3 different variations of chocolate cupcakes were awesomely delectable, unbelievably moist with a beautiful and distinct taste to all three creations. My Sister was thrilled and in Chocolate Cupcake heaven!   I most definitely recommend Short and Sweet for lovely, delicious, fresh and beautifully baked goodies!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. My friend introduced me to their cupcakes and I was hooked immediately! I love the chocolate, vanilla and coconut cupcakes. They have so many different flavors and all their products are fresh and delicious. I ordered a cake for a party which was ready for pickup on time ( ordered 1 week earlier). It looked beautiful and tasted great. I would order from them again if I had another occasion. Enjoy"}
