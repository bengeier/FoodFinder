{"text":"5 stars for service, 4 for the food. I had the salmon but the asparagus that came with is was rather large and tasteless. Service was good with attentive and personable wait staff although I had to wait a few minutes to be seated. This restaurant is inside the Hilton hotel."}
{"text":"I give the food 3 stars the service 3 and atmosphere 2.  The hotel itself is a dump and the drink prices I find a bit pricy. Seriously almost 9 bucks for bud in a pint? Sheesh.  I had chicken wings and some fries and found them \"ok\" but nothing to write home about.  No VLTs if your into that, nothing to see here really on the entertainment side you haven't seen in low end bars.  Place is comfy ish and not too loud, staff is nice and English is not a big problem.  It's good to unwind but the pricy brews sort of are a through off."}
{"text":"This was the best restaurant in a Hilton Garden Inn I've ever eaten at!  Excellent preparation, great wait staff and attention to detail.  Had striped bass that was out of this world.  Next trip to Montreal I may stay at the hotel again just to eat at the restaurant!"}
{"text":"Ordered a cheeseburger it clearly wasn't made fresh, I was more like a bland dry oversized hockey puck. It was at least 2 days old. Service was poor. Fri s and salad were good. French onion soup not fresh. Not worth $26."}
