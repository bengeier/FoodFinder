{"text":"Very inconsistent!  One day the chicken is tasty,  thenthr  next visit the chicken is dry or tastes like rubber.  Sometimes the rice is great, then it colorless and tasteless!  What gives??"}
{"text":"Very blah and tasteless food. I'm Portuguese so I have higher expectations. Firstly we weren't given any real menu the waitress told us what they had and handed us a hand written paper with other options. We both had the Bitoque the steak was tiny and there was absolutely no taste to it. It tasted like it was taken out of freezer and put on grill. I won't be back"}
{"text":"I have dined in about a hand full of times at the restaurant and it's always different every time I go. The restaurant is tucked away so I can only imagine ever knowing about it from word of mouth or living within that neighbourhood.

The first I came here with a large group and I had the traditional bife a casa which is piece of beef, with a fried egg and accompanied by a salad and thin style fries. It was very tasty and the portion was huge! I was very pleased with the service and the food. Again, we were in a large group so it take longer than usual for food to come out but with the shrimp starter and endless bread, we had something to accompany our hunger till the food arrived.

The second time I went to this restaurant was with my sister in law and brother in law on a Friday. We called to make a reservation as the restaurant can fill up easily. The gentleman who attended us brought us a great bottle of wine (we let him decide a nice red for us) and it was very smooth and enjoyable. We had a shrimp starter again with bread and we all shared a platter of fries, salad and beef skewers. The beef was flavourful and cooked to perfection.

Unfortunately the last time I ate there was not so successful. We had grilled squid and it was extremely overcooked to the point that it was complete rubber. Not only mine but 3 other people in our large group also had issues. The staff was nice enough to remove it off the bill and provide us with a complimentary meal in lieu of the disastrous overcooked (and under cooked squid).  


If you are looking for a cozy place to enjoy some delicious Portuguese food- give this place a try, I know we will probably be back as some of our group of friends are regulars so hopefully next time will be just like my first two experiences.

I would just recommend they get a typed out menu , that is my only recommendation ;)"}
