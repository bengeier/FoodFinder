{"text":"Hidden little gem tucked in the corner of a strip mall.  I had the combo beef and chicken  koobideh. Very moist and tasty chicken and tasty beef.  Lentil soup very fresh and hot.  Everything was great.  Check it out."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat on my days off!! Highly recommend this place!! Customer service is great, fast service and the owners are really nice!! My favorite dish is number 1!!"}
{"text":"Best food great people family owned and operated you won't be disappointed if you like middle eastern food I recommend this place over all other Persian/Iranian restaurants and one last thing very affordable."}
{"text":"We drive to Las Vegas almost every month and since we have a house in Summerlin which is a short drive from this restaurant, we always eat at this place every time. I am almost sure it is a family run business. The service is top notch and the food is fantastic and very authentic. We are biased toward Mediterranean dishes because of health reason. This place is at the top of our list."}
{"text":"This place is great , I would definitely recommended it  and return and buy more food from here. The kebab and rice was amazing."}
{"text":"this is a reasonable place for Persian/Mediterranean food. a lil on a the pricey side with a small menu which I like. 

hummus, had their version of tzaseki, the soltani plate and the kobedieh plate...both were delicious. their baklava not so much, but overall its worth the price for something authentic tasting. =) 

*thumbs up*"}
{"text":"I ate here and the food IS horrible. The service is to damn slow and the menu is freakin small"}
{"text":"How could you go wrong with food made by food lovers like this lovely couple? They love what they do and take pride in it. Food is made from scratch and with fresh ingredients. Hands down best kabob in Las Vegas served with smile and great service. Give this place a try and you are guaranteed to go back for more..."}
{"text":"One of the best Persian restaurants. Great Food and fantastic service. The Resturant is family owned and the food exemplifies that fact. I will stop by anytime visiting Las Vegas. The Chef/owner is dedicated to perfection."}
{"text":"By far my favorite Mediterranean restaurant in Vegas. I ordered the Tabbouleh salad, it was seasoned perfectly and had very fresh tomatoes and cucumbers added to the parsley and bulgur mix. Not too lemony done just right. For my entree I had the koobideh kabob plate. It was presented very nicely with a roasted tomato, quarter onion, white basmati rice with saffron on top, and the kabob was cooked to perfection. The flavors were amazing and I could tell all of their food was cooked with love and dedication. I will definitely be back and this time bring my fiancée. Keep up the good work Aria!!"}
{"text":"Mouthwatering kabobs, super clean restaurant and lovely husband and wife running the place!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been to this new restaurant a few times already and the food has been consistently good.  The koobideh and chicken kabob are great. We love their Sunday special- beryooni.  It's a delicious meat dish and they only serve it on Sundays.  We're so happy that a persian restaurant in town finally offers this dish and it's done so well!"}
{"text":"I was there 2 times with my Family, as I am vegeterian tou could find many delicious vegeterian foods there, my son like Kebob Kobide too much and also Dough as drink, and I suggest Tadeeg if you like something to start, also try for Beryoon and other kind of Kabob if you like meet, all materials are fresh and nice welcoming will find there, free WiFi and traditional Traciration also nice"}
{"text":"My husband and I looked on Yelp for a place to eat that was close to our two appointments. With 76 reviews and 5 stars we decided to try it. Everything was excellent! From the very polite waitress, to the cook smiling from behind the glass window in the kitchen, the clean bathrooms, cool music, very reasonable prices...and I had #19 Chicken Koobideh which was very tasty! We had a limited time between the two appointments and the service was fast. We even had time to write this Yelp review before leaving. We will certainly eat here again and tell our friends about it. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I always eat here when I come to vegas. Food and customer service is excellent. I'll come again."}
{"text":"Visiting Vegas from Michigan. We were told to try this while we're here. Absolutely fantastic! Service was great, food was great, portions were huge and price was appropriate for how much food we received. Chicken was so good! Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Awesome 
I love this place
tasty appetizer 
delicious food
Fast service 
 polite  and friendly 
I highly recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"Excellent family-owned restaurant. Great food. Breads are made at a viewing station which is fun."}
{"text":"I'm vegetarian and it's too hard for me to find a place with my desired food in town.
best thing that I really liked in this restaurant, I could find a big talent of nutrition and creation vegetarian version of middle eastern food like meatless ghrome sabzi and meatless gheymeh and it's really great that you can eat the best taste of persian food without any meat.
highly recommended to everyone."}
{"text":"Best meditranian restaurant in whole entire las vegas.... great customer service, loved it"}
{"text":"Enjoyed this place twice for lunch.  Very clean and had stylish decor.  A comfortable eating environment.   The waitresses were very attentive and I wasnt disappointed with the service.
For appetizers  we have ordered the taboli salad which had just the right flavors, and the humus served with warm pita which is out of this world.  Ask for more pita you're going to need it.  We also have had the lentil soup and the barley soup.  The soups were warm with flavors and very delicious.   The apps and soups were amazingly priced.  
For the main course we had the Bakhtiari kabobs with rice.  The meat was so tender and full of flavor and very filling.  The rice perfectly done.  We also have had the beef koobidah and that was seasoned nicely as well.  The gheymeh stew was amazing.  The meat tender and falling apart.  It was a warm comfort dish.  
For desert we had the hot tea served with sugar cubes.  The tea had such a wonderful flavor.  The baklava was to die for.  I coukdnt get enough of it.  I will be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Persian restaurant ever!!!! Oh my god I actually crave their rice with butter every day. First Persian restaurant I've ever been to and it was the most pleasant experience I've had. They are a family business which makes the food taste more fresh and homey! You guys should go and try out their food!!!!"}
{"text":"We have been in Vegas for many times and we just found this amazing Persian restaurant this time. They just got opened and it belongs to a friendly couple. We have been there for many times while our visiting here and we tried all of their food. Honestly they're all amazing and absolutely delicious with a good price."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. I ordered chicken kebab and beef koobideh. The menu is simple, maybe 12 items, consisting of various permutations of chicken or beef, kebab or koobideh (which is whole meat versus ground meat), rice or bread. We over-ordered because the portions pictured on the menu look average, but in real life the portions were large. Big pieces of chicken, a tomato the size of a tennis ball, a whole onion. I had the side of rice. My brother had the bread, which is called lavash and is thinner than pita. He liked it. My parents had the salad and liked it. We would be glad to come back here."}
{"text":"I live around the corner and saw this restaurant so I gave it a go. I'm a vegetarian so I was pleased to see the options. I ordered an eggplant and rice entree and it was delicious. The restaurant itself is very nice and has a beautiful outdoor patio for large parties. The service was wonderful as well. I will go again."}
{"text":"This is easily the best Persian restaurant in Las Vegas!  From the hummus, lentil soup to the beef koubideh and the fesenjan this food is amazing!!  Although I'm not Persian I grew up in south Orange County, CA and frequented Caspian.  Aria rivals if not beats Caspian with its authenticity and flavorful offerings served by the warmest and sweetest family! So glad they are here, we can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem. The interior is adorably decorated and super clean. I had the Gormeh Sabzi (stew) which while I couldn't pronounce it, I could sure eat it! Delicious and filling on a cold windy night. Mom had the lentil soup and house salad. Salad was huge with a light tangy dressing. We started with the mast & khier which was a tasty cucumber yogurt dip. Delish! We got an extra order to bring home. Capped off with fresh made baklava. Yum. Our young waitress was a delight, helpful and as sweet as the baklava. You'd never guess from the looks of the shopping center that a great little restaurant is hiding in the corner, but we are sure glad it is."}
{"text":"It's one of the best place to eat Mediterranean food and spend time with friends. They also have an outdoor hookah lounge and it was awesome with authentic eastern environment."}
{"text":"The place looks sketchy from outside but my goodness! The food is to die for. Meat is consistently juicy and staff is warm esp the owners. 
House salad dressing is so simple and tasty, desserts are sumptuous! 

I definitely highly recommend Hafez (used to be Aria) if you're looking for authentic Mediterranean and or Persian food."}
{"text":"Very fine Persian cuisine made with lots of care. The family running the place are very kind and make the environment very cosy and home like. Prices are very reasonable and quality of food is excellent. I'll recommend it to all my friends."}
{"text":"Aria is one of the best mediterranean/Persian restaurant in the Valley, have an amazing customer service, clean environment, and amazing food. They will treat you like a family. I would recommend this place to anyone who has good taste for high quality food."}
{"text":"I got the beef koobideh with rice. It was very good. Great service as well. Also had the hot tea. It was great."}
{"text":"The best Kobideh I ever had. The bargain is pretty good too. Overall awsome place. Good atmosphere. Nice owner. Short handed. But service is still good.

People liking persian food should definitely try this  it is worth the 30 min drive from the strip."}
{"text":"An amazing restaurant and staff. Love this place the food is so delicious. I can say this is the best persian food ever.
I would highly suggest this place to anyone who loves persian food and kabobs."}
{"text":"Food is delicious, nicely decorated just a mom and pop restaurant. Not like Vegas glitters and stuffs. Just a cook and one wait stuff in Monday night. It took good half an hour for our order to arrive but I have patience for that, it means my food was cooked properly. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to say that the food here was mediocre at best. We KNOW Persian food. My husband is Persian and we have many Persian friends who are excellent cooks.
We had three different kabobs--koobideh, filet, and boneless chicken. The koobideh was okay. The filet was overcooked and tough. The chicken was juicy and plentiful but lacked flavor. The rice was very oily. Salads were pretty good, tabouli and shirazi. The highlight of the meal was the saffron ice cream. No alcohol is served here.
Our server was very friendly, helpful and attentive."}
{"text":"My family came here for dinner and we all really enjoyed our food. The restaurant is clean and comfortable, and our server was so patient while we ordered. She explained what the foods were to my kids and let us know that the portions are large so we would not be surprised. Everything looked just like it did in the pictures on the menu! All of our food was fantastic! Thank you so much for a wonderful evening. You are my new favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"This wonderful Persian restaurant was recommended by my Afghani Uber driver. He said it is the best Persian food in Vegas. No reason to doubt him. Great family owned business serving up delicious Persian cuisine. I ordered Kasht o Bademjan, a delectable eggplant-based dip that is served with a freshly made bread. I demolished it, even scraping the plate, leaving no room for my delicious lamb shank entree, a Saturday special. Wonderful and interesting experience in a place filled with Persian people. I will come back again and again. Wonderful owners."}
{"text":"A must try! They make fresh bread for each table, and it's very good. Ghormeh sabzi was so delicious, the best I've had! The kabobs are very juicy. You cannot leave without having their homemade baklava and saffron pistachio ice cream, it's an experience you don't want to miss!"}
{"text":"Good Persian food in Las Vegas is hard to come by. Especially if you looking for more than just kabobs. Although this place is far from me, I decided to pay it a visit. Don't let the old shopping center and area fool you. Once inside, it is very nicely decorated place and the food was very good. Places like this are hard to come by in our town, so I suggest everyone that likes Persian food to pay it a visit so they are successful and remain open. I know I will."}
{"text":"Out off all the Persian food here in Vegas this is by far my favorite place to eat. I'd say we eat their koobideh's at least 1-2 times a week. They make a homemade type bread there also and it's TO DIE FOR. Definitely recommended :)"}
{"text":"Well designed and very tasty food. Exellent hospitality. Quiet and peaceful. Traditional interior design"}
{"text":"We ordered the combo , celery stew and tahdig with stew . Combo and the the celery stew were good but tahdig was really bad . When we told the server she laughed and said tahdig is suppose to be like this. Tahdig was not edible. She didnt even apalogize and gave us attitude. Very bad costumber service. In between im persian so I know how tahdig should taste like and i could also tell the tahdig was at from the day before . I came at 12 pm on a weekday so maybe if i came later in the day they would serve me a fresh tahdig . Again combo and celery stew were good. They should definetly aknowledge costumer's concerns instead of dismissing it like how our server did."}
{"text":"One of the best Persian foods in Las Vegas! Try this place if you are looking for a different experience."}
{"text":"Love this hole in the wall
Amazing food seasoned well
Great staff (family owned and operated) 
Portions are enough to feed two :)
Prices are cheap compared to food quality 

I forgot to take photo of my plate, once I tasted it I couldn't stop :)"}
{"text":"Great service and delicious Persian food, I had the chicken kabob with rice and grill tomato  ....see you soon."}
{"text":"I found this place in Yelp of course. From the outside it looks like a tattoo place haha. But once you open the door the place looks very nice with wood floor and neatly decorated walls. 

The price is pretty good and it is delicious too. I was surprised with the amount of food per serving. There's no way I can finish a plate. I ate half of it and took home half. It's pretty substantial. The chicken is well marinated and flavorful. I will come back."}
{"text":"I love this family restaurant with authentic, delicious food. We eat here regularly and especially enjoy the kebabs. Service is friendly and prompt. A must-visit!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. I have eaten here several times since I discovered it.

The ghorme sabzi is better than my moms and thats saying a lot (don't tell my mom). 
The gheymeh is not very good in my opinion. I think its just a different style than I am used to.

The beef koobideh is perfect. Good quality meat. Juicy. And it doesn't taste like it has any fillers. The chicken koobideh is good as well.

The chicken kabob is very good and and must have. Well marinated.

Unfortunately the filet in the soltani kabob is not very good. I tried it once and it was tough and dry. I think its just the quality of the meat. I should try it again.

Service is great. The owners are in the kitchen cooking and serving you. Very humble couple.
I cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent prices (Most other places would charge you double for less quality food,) excellent service, and incredibly clean. I highly recommend eating here, the environment is inviting and the food is made with passion, something most other persian restaurants lack. Aria has a long time customer in my entire family who eat here frequently. It is located conveniently off of the 95 close to summerln and couldn't be a better fit for what we were looking for close to home, thank you Aria for the amazing service and food."}
{"text":"Amazing kabob. Feels like home! Absolutely amazing! Chicken koobideh kabob is my favorite. Homemade baklava. Best I have ever had."}
{"text":"The food and hospitality was excellent. The prices were very reasonable. The best Mediterranean food I this side of town, a MUST TRY!."}
{"text":"Totally enjoyed this Mediterranean experience. From the yogurt drink and appetizer of eggplant dip with bread to the dessert of fresh, homemade baklava, it was all so good. The soltani beef was so tender, the chicken so moist and flavorful!"}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean food in vegas! And great service! You have to get the kabob meal combo with the rice so good"}
{"text":"Simply amazing!  Great services offering an exquisite Persian cuisine.  This is my go to place for Persian food.

I normally go for their Bakhtiari Kabob, which is plump, tasty charbroiled chicken and beef goodness served with basmati rice (white and yellow), charred tomato, charred pepper and white onion.  I have eaten similar dishes in other eateries without questions, but here the service is so genuinely nice and approachable that i had to ask if there was a particular way of eating the dish. The wonderful server  enthusiastically explained that they normally smash the tomato into the rice along with the butter (optional) and take a bite of the onion and chard pepper with the meat,  ah ha, and that is exactly how I would end up enjoying this dish.   

Another yummy thing to enjoy here is their cooked to order Sangak Bread which you can see cook in their special oven right before your eyes! this is easily enjoyed alone or with any of their yogurt, hummus, eggplant dips or soup.

I also recommend their homemade Iced Tea which is so refreshing and don't forget dessert.   Their baklava is on my list for next time but for the last couple of trips i cannot pass up on their Saffron Pistachio Ice Cream made right on premise... simply decadent!

The portions are huge, the eating experience is unique and the service is the topper and absolutely the best!"}
{"text":"Husband and I truly enjoyed eating here. It's about a ten minute drive away from the strip and definitely worth it. We were one of the first ones there and were seated immediately. We usually order the same appetizers and plates whenever we try a new Persian restaurant. We ordered the kashke bademjun for an appetizer and ordered the chicken and meat koobideh. They brought fresh bread which we watch them make right in front of us. The food came shortly after the appetizer (fast service.) The food was extremely flavorful and there was so much food we packed the extras to go. For dessert we ordered a baklava and drank tea with it. It was perfect! Also, I believe they made the baklava, but I never asked. It was fresh and delicious.  We're not from here so this will be a must to stop by the next time we're in town."}
{"text":"I love the food and the owner of the business is so friendly and I enjoyed the food. One of the best Persian food. Ask them for Saffron's Ice-cream ... Highly recommended it."}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday night as I missed my mom and dads home cooking. I got the dough it is a yogurt drink with dill and mint. It helps you sleep at night and salty but yet somehow refreshing. 

Appetizer was the delicious house made bread and I ordered the yogurt with shallots(cousin to onion and garlic). The yogurt is not as thick as I typically like it as i like it to be made with half labneh and half regular yogurt but nothing is going to be perfect for everyone. 

As an entree I got the beef chunks with the chicken breast chunks. They were both so juicy and delicious. The rice was soft and fluffy, with a side of roasted tomato, a side of roasted jalapeno and of course onion. 

In my family some people crush up the tomato into the rice and add the butter with the brown seasoning, personally I am not a big fan of that. The food here is very traditional and delicious. it is fresh and I will be back.

I was able to try the ground chicken skewer and ground beef skewer. The ground chicken was a little drier and not as tasty as the beef but the seasoning was great on both. 

The service was friendly to say the least, very personable and I felt comfortable there. There are many times that Persian restaurants make me feel very out of place but this was not one of them. 

For dessert i did have rose water ice cream which my girlfriend stated tasted like perfume but to me it tasted right. It is a floral tasting ice cream that has pistachios in it. 

I will be back and will make sure my family comes here when they are in town. I just wish they had a belly dancer or some kind of entertainment because in Cali (where I am from) typically they have that on some nights. I think it would be a great addition to this gem in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"The food was excellent! I ordered the beef koobideh  with rice and it was perfect.  Hummus was delish! The portions are big and enough for sharing. Definitely will be back soon!"}
{"text":"My family and I were searching for a good Persian/Mediterranean Restaurant and we found it.  The food was absolutely delicious, and we enjoyed it very much. What was even more welcoming was that if felt like a family run restaurant, that which you don't see much of in Las Vegas. My parents who are unfamiliar with Persian food were very pleased with everything. I personally thought the Black Tea was a perfect combination with my order! Thank You!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food, huge portions and very friendly service... if you haven't tried it, you definitely should!"}
{"text":"Food is just okay and overpriced for what it is. We ordered the chicken koobideh with all salad instead of rice and the mixed grill plate (chicken and steak). The meat was all overcooked and dry, but the bread was pretty good. Though, I wouldn't come to a restaurant just for bread. Service was great and the waitress was very kind."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on my day off. I love Middle Eastern food and decided to try Hafez after seeing other good reviews..  SO GLAD I did. Definitely looks like a spot where the locals go since there were several people picking up takeout orders. Food was great! Very fresh and flavorful and the service was even better...  I felt like I was in someone's home; the staff took very good care of me. Absolutely recommend it and will go back often."}
{"text":"Delicious food and excellent customer service. They go higher and further to make sure that you get the best experience. Thank you for delicious food!"}
{"text":"Recently open in the former Fish Delish space, Aria is a new spot in the 'hood offering Mediterranean. Menu is currently limited to various kabob plates with rice, and a few traditional stews, and they don't currently offer lunch specials- which I think would be a good idea to implement. 

Tried the plate with beef and chicken kabobs, subbed a house salad for the rice without an extra charge. Most plates are about $10, but some go up to about $18 based on quality of meat used.  
,
Service was polite and interior has undergone a complete remodel, and looks great. Hoping they add lunch specials and get some advertising going- they're already in a spot that is hard to find if you don't know about it. Far left corner in the Food 4 Less plaza, if you need help finding it."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was nice and the service was good. Even though it was cooked well, I was not a fan of their koobideh. Didn't taste like the authentic Persian places back home in Cali. The spices left a bad taste. Everything else was just ok."}
{"text":"Best persian food in town. Believe me I've tried them all. The chef is persian too so it cant get any better."}
{"text":"Very good food. I ordered humus and the ground beef kabobs with rice. There was a generous portion of humus and they gave me more bread. It was fresh and tasty. 

The kabobs and rice were moist. They were also fresh and well seasoned. You get a roasted tomato and some raw onion. I prefer the onion thrown on the fire for a few seconds. 

Place was clean and tidy. I did not visit the restrooms. 

Prices are more than reasonable. $18 excluding tip. 

I would recommend stopping here if you want a quiet dinner without going to the strip. Small menu but essential to make a good choice. They will also customize your dish if you want to try a variety. The pictures posted by others speak for themselves."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best Persian spot I've tried in Vegas. Really delicious. The koobideh is very affordable and high quality, perfectly juicy without being too fatty. The new lamb dishes they've added, like the ribs, are amazing. The saffron ice cream is great. The rice is top notch. Gormeh Sabzi is good, especially with the tahdig. The eggplant dip (Kashk o Bademjan) is great as well, silky with notes of nuts spices and eggplant. They've even knocked it out with the pomegranate chicken (fesenjan). I suggest trying this restaurant wholeheartedly (make sure you get the bread)."}
{"text":"Met the family here for dinner last night. It's a very small mom and pop type place but don't let that deter you. The kabobs were amazing! I plan on coming back here often. I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"I'd never had Persian food until I tried Hafez, fka Aria, last week.  The food here is absolutely outstanding.  The Koobidehs, especially the beef, is so delicious, especially with lemon juice squeezed onto it.  I've already been back again since I first went last week!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The food is delicious and the family that runs it, makes sure that your experience is perfect. My personal favorite is #26 (please don't ask me how to pronounce it). It is kebobed chicken and beef. Very tasty. Mix in some shirazi salad (again probably mis-spelling) and the meal is unparalleled. Meals come with rice and for about $20 per plate the value is great. For most eaters, there is enough food for dinner and for lunch the next day. So glad that we found this place!"}
{"text":"Every time we comes to visit Las Vegas we have to stop by to Aria restaurant it's one of the best Persian restaurant in town the best fresh and tasty food and the owners are very nice people"}
{"text":"I could not agree more with the friendly service. Outstanding!
Since the food quality matches the service, there really is nothing left to say. EAT THERE. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This quaint hole in the wall, corner of the shopping center is an amazing find. The food is so good I have been addicted since my first visit. 

The meats and rice along with the baked veggies rock. The Tabooli is a great salad. I would recommend this place to anyone. Great location, great food!"}
{"text":"I had the babagabagababababa. I have no idea what I had..something with eggplant, and it was WONDERFUL! Great atmosphere, beautiful t.v. ads of nature, butterflies, etc...nice music, very nice lady and guy who run the place.  Good thing I don't live in vegas or I would just give them my wallet because the food was quite good. The prices are decent for this type of quality food.

It is in the corner of the stripmall. Go there, and be nice to the owner(s). they are nice people and their food is very solid in quality and taste."}
{"text":"I always have seen this place when i just to go to the drive trhu from carls jr.  Great food, with afdordable prices and generous portions. The customer service from this people is very kind. Their baklava is awesome. I wanted to try their little patio but it wasnt available i guess cause the weather"}
{"text":"The best Taboli & Hummus... Anywhere. Everything we have tried, we have loved! Great service, amazing food.  I wish there were 6 stars to give!"}
{"text":"It was the best iranian restaurants in the las vegas. I really liked it.  Fantastic menu and fantastic taste!"}
{"text":"Truly authentic Mediterranean/ Persian cuisine. I had the Aria Shish Leek and it was exceptionally delicious . The restaurant decore complements the exquisite and delightful cuisine that it's served in the hidden gem . The service was extremely excellent. The staff attended to our every need with a smile. My wife and I had a wonderful dinner experience visiting Aria."}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmm mmh!  

From the reviews I've posted, you'll see I've been going down my list of cuisines to try and this week happened to be Persian.  

I usually ask the waitress/waiter what s/he recommends and this week was no exception. She recommended the Bakhtiari Kabob (tender, juicy, marinated beef and chicken chunks served with basmati rice) and suggested I smear the butter all over the rice.  Ooooh weee!  I diced the onion then mixed it with the rice then sliced the tomato so I could dab the chicken in the tomato juice. There was a lime half hiding in the distance, I found it and squeezed lime juice all over the rice too - not sure if I was supposed to do that, but that didn't matter.  The fresh lime juice kicked the flavor up a notch to most satisfactory."}
{"text":"Very good casual Persian restaurant. The food was excellent no complaints about anything. Perfect for when you don't want to get dressed up just to go eat. Would definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best Kabob places in town.
Great quality food large portions value priced.
you gotta try this place out ! ! !"}
{"text":"The Skinny: thumbs up on the beef koobideh, the appetizers were only okay (3) service was prompt and friendly, FYI: there are no diaper changing facilities (4) value: the food is solid but not outstanding (3.5) 

Hankering for some kashkeh bademjoon, we headed over to Aria for dinner. We ordered hummus($4), masto khiar($4), kashkeh bademjoon($6) ,  house salad($4), and customized a plate of koobideh (beef and chicken, $3.50 each) on sangak ($3.50).

The hummus and masto khiar were okay in my books. The masto khiar was a little too thin and there wasn't enough cucumber mixed in. The hummus did taste homemade but it lacked enough flavoring to make it really shine. Kashkeh bademjoon was okay 
but nothing that stands out. The house salad was nothing special. 

This was served with some warmed pita bread but obviously not made in house. 

The beef koobideh on the other hand was great - just enough onion and seasoning to bring out the beef flavor. The chicken koobideh however wasn't as good as the beef. The sangak was lightly grilled and buttered. 

The service was pretty good for a small place like this and friendly. 

Overall, this restaurant serves some good beef koobideh but the other stuff is just okay. 3 starred review."}
{"text":"Best Persian food in Vegas 
Test like a home made food, it's so fresh and Good service"}
{"text":"Aria is a hidden gem of Mediterranean restaurants in town. Family own & run. They are so warm and welcoming. The food is authentic and consistently great."}
{"text":"New to the town. Tried other Persian restaurants out here but definitely this restaurant is not comparable to other restaurants tried in Vegas. By far the Most delicious and juiciest kabob koobideh that  you can have."}
{"text":"Amazing! Great customer service and delicious food! Definitely coming back again! Their also going to expand their place and have a hookah lounge outside!"}
{"text":"Great service,  amazing food , cool and cozy  absolutely try it , 
And they have vegetarian menu"}
{"text":"This is definitely a gem in Las Vegas. I though I'd never say this, but their food is comparable to Los Angles Persian food. I'm so glad to have an authentic and delicious Persian food to indulge in, here in Vegas now. Their Kabobs were very very good. The place looks very nice, inviting and clean. They need to have another location on the East side!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love meditteranean food, in particular, Persian cuisine is a favorite. Aria is excellent, I had the Koubideh combo and my husband had chicken koubideh. We will definitely be back."}

Their hot Persian tea is great!!! The service is very impressive, they're super friendly and welcoming!!! The hummus is the best!!! The masto khiar was also very delicious!!! You must come here if you can appreciate Mediterranean food!!!! Superb!!!! 6 stars!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here the other night after a long day snowboarding and ordered a few meals for takeout. I had heard about this place online, but was in the area and had to come check it out. We ordered kabob e barg, and joojeh kabob as well as tadig with ghormeh sabzi and khoresh e gheimeh on the side. Mitra, the nice woman who took our order was kind enough to give us a half order of each since we originally wanted fesenjan but they either don't have it on the menu or were out of it.

We also ordered the kashk e bademjan and it was great. Now that I know they're legit, I'll stay there for dinner next time because that's the real way to enjoy Persian Food! Glad to have another Persian spot in Vegas. Hope you guys stick around!

Yek donya mamnoon!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! Great prices and well worth the drive! If you are in the Las Vegas area and love Persian  food.  You will be happy you found this restaurant. We have tried numerous items on the menu and have loved every single one!  Like I said  Amazing!"}
{"text":"My husband and I don't get to this side of town often, but when we do, we always stop at Aria, for the best Persian food we've ever tasted! Everyone is so friendly, and the food is always superb. Very clean place without a speck of dirt anywhere! I'm sure we'd eat there every week if we didn't live 45 minutes away. It's always a treat to visit this wonderful restaurant."}
{"text":"The food is great and I love them so much. The business runs with owner and they treat the customers the best ... I always go there when I am in Las Vegas ... highly recommended with unique environment and quality food.
Try their foods and you will see what I am talking about. A+++"}
{"text":"SO DELICIOUS! 
Perfectly seasoned, juicy grilled meats, gorgeous crisp vegetables, delicious fresh bread. The owner and the waitress are so sweet and welcoming. I'm sad that I don't live here, or I would be a regular! 
When in Vegas, eat like a Persian!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful little gem my husband and I stumbled upon!! We love Persian food and this place was amazing. You can tell the food was made with love and pride. Their koobideh was flavorful and their saffron rice was so yummy. I had the Sunday special: biryani, which I had no idea what it was just that it was lamb (which I love). It's basically like a lamb pâté put on top of lavash and a side of fresh basil, like, and onion. The really sweet server showed us how to traditionally eat the dish. It was so delicious.

We will definitely come here again. Great food, clean place, wonderful service. 5 stars :)"}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoyed a wonderful dinner at Aria on Saturday August 20th during a visit to Las Vegas from Los Angeles.  We wanted to get off the Strip and chose Aria based on the positive Yelp reviews, which were spot on. Tucked into the corner of a strip (small \"s\"!!) mall, Aria appears to be a family run restaurant.  The waitress was outstanding:  warm, responsive, and genuinely interested in how we enjoyed the meal.  The food was excellent.  We ordered soups for starters (barley for my wife and lentil for me), which were healthy and delicious.  For a main course my wife ordered the chicken with bone, which consisted of chunks of chicken with bone marinated and charbroiled over open fire and served with basmati rice with a side of grilled tomato.  I ordered the boneless (and skinless) chicken kabob, which was also served with basmati rice and a side of grilled tomato.  We very much enjoyed each meal and look forward to returning to Aria on our next trip to LV.  Thank you."}
{"text":"Great service, great food... what else could a person want? I came here with my boyfriend's family and we all thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of our meal. We ordered a bunch of appetizers, and they were all so good! We ordered hummus, maast-o-khiar (cucumber yogurt), maast-o-musir (shallot yogurt), salad shirazi, and tadigh. We had the opportunity to try all their stews with the tahdig, and they were all delicious. 

If you're looking for great Middle Eastern food, specifically Persian food while in Vegas, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"This place is great, the bomb, amazing! Whatever you want to call it. A few miles from the strip.  great prices, even better food. Kabob is incredible. Just a great great place & a must try."}
{"text":"Very tasty food!!!! Thanks for delicious meal if you are looking for the best Persian food this the place."}
{"text":"Best persian food in the valley. Beats out the spots in LA
Try the homemade ice cream"}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp, I found this little gem and it was amazing! It is a bit inconspicuous but the service and food was great. The lamb kabob was especially delicious. We would definitely go again if we were in the Vegas area."}
{"text":"Best persian food. Awesome shishlik (lamp chops) and best ghormeh sabzi  Family owned and friendly service at extremly reasonable prices. Well worth the drive!!!"}
{"text":"I've had Persian food before and I always thought the cuisine had a relatively safe, but low ceiling.  I thought this place was excellent.  The ambiance is nice, the service was quick and attentive and the food was delicious and flavorful.  The hummus appetizer was fresh and a must have, the entrees were also very good, it's a bit of a drive from my place, but I will be adding it to the list of restaurants I frequently attend."}
{"text":"I visited Hafez (formerly Aria) with a large group for dinner. We arrived late for our reservation but were still happily greeted and seated. We started with the fresh brewed iced tea (delicious) and ordered hummus and taftoon and tahdig which was delicious and enough for 6 to share. As an entree I had the thin filet with half rice and half shirazi salad. My friends ordered chicken kebabs and salmon. The steak was well seasoned with a nice char on the outside and the Shirazi salad was fresh delightful. I tried the salmon as well it was well cooked and seasoned. The portions here are large and can easily be served family style. The service was outstanding from start to finish and I will definitely be back. Thanks for a great experience."}
{"text":"Amazing place! Delicious food and very nice/pleasant staff. They treat you with so much respect here and really take care of you. Eat here is you want to be treated like family and dine like Persian Royalty!"}
{"text":"Quaint little spot tucked away in the corner of a shopping center. Very nicely decorated inside giving me a Mediterranean feel with some cool background music.  Very friendly and helpful husband and wife team running it and the food was excellent.  Try the Baklava for desert."}
{"text":"I love this place,amazing food,big plates ,really authentic. Very highly recommended,must come and enjoy !"}
{"text":"This is an excellent Persian Restaurant! A true Gem and must for all even Vegans like me!!!
Hummus is the Best on the planet and Iam well traveled!! All the breads are awesome and very fresh!! Salads and entree are all Fresh and Healthy!! Loved the homemade Iced tea and of-course the Baklava!!"}
{"text":"So happy to find a delicious Persian restaurant in Las Vegas!!!!  We ordered takeout so not sure how dining service is but takeout service was good!  Enjoyed koobideh (ground beef kabob), chicken kabob, soltani (thin sliced filet mignon), basamati rice, grilled tomatoes & chili pepper.  Don't forget the  tzatziki sauce because it pairs well when you eat your meats, rice & veggies together!  I also enjoyed their tasty eggplant dip!!!  The only thing I didn't care for was the baklava, it was tasty but not as crispy as I like.  I will definitely be back again and support this local family spot because of the warming service & of course good eats!  Support Your Locals!  Eat Local!!!"}
{"text":"We are from Los Angeles.  If you like Raffi's in Glendale, you will definitely like this place.  Actually, I think their Chicken Koobideh and the Ground Beef Koobideh are better than Raffi's.
The service is unmatched by anyone!!
Now that we found this great place, we'll be back every time we come to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Koubideh kabab was terrible ( I tried  that two times) also their food is flooded by oil!
Certainly not a place to go! I also do not understand the response from owner \" asking for No butter on your Kabob!\" I meant the way they have prepared food they've flooded it with oil."}
{"text":"Great good, Great Prices. Mom and Pop restaurant, you can see the owner cooking in the kitchen. I ordered the beef skewer with bread only and ate it with onions and sumac. Best meal i needed after a long CES show."}
{"text":"This is excellent Persian food, the meat is soft and very tasty. Portions are good, prize is just right. Staff is very friendly, specially Nousha, highly recommend it if you are here in Vegas. We come here all the time now,  must visit."}
{"text":"Great restaurant!  
Very tasty, and healthy food! 
Here you can really spend time and have a delicious meal, with the whole family! 
The owners of this restaurant are very friendly and well-serviced!"}
{"text":"Now called Hafez--this is by far the best Persian restaurant in Nevada.  Try their Tadig with two stews---awesome!  Also their lamb chops are great!"}
{"text":"Very good, solid food. Tasty, large portions for cheap. I feel like it had potential to be a five star meal- delicious chicken chunks, an uncut onion, and excessively spicy uncut jalapeño, a uncut tomato, and flavorless rice could've come together really well if it was served together- instead they give the components but it feels disjointed.

Still really good, they could easily reduce portion sizes by 20-30% and sell for the same (BIG plates). Saffron ice cream was good. Overall a nice dining experience."}
{"text":"OMG! where Should I start? Health hazard!!. This place has the most amount of oil and greases your food can have. It was my first time there today and definitely the last. 

1) The place is understaffed. ( I looked through the window and there was 2 guys in the kitchen ( no head nets for 1 guy, one wearing bandana) and one skinny rude lady running around)
2) There was a Lady reading a foreign book in the corner with no food and she didn't look like a customer ( creepy)
3) They need a better music.
4) The menu is decent but not as good as other Persian restaurants in town.
5) Parking is hard to find and the 2 parking close to the store has a 9-1-1 tow sign on it. I do not know if it's even legal to call your business 9-1-1, people draw confusion between real 9-1-1 and tow company with 9-1-1 resemblance. ( rest of the front parking are taken by the dog grooming shop)
6) parking sign says Aria restaurant 10 min parking even though the place is called Hafez. So confusing....

I realize they are a small business and I did my best to give them a good review, but they need to stop putting as much oil in their food. People want less oil and grease these days and age.

As a former chef, I know why this restaurant put a lot of oil. Its because oil and grease are fulfilling so you would think they gave you a large portion, and also you do not have to taste the unpleasant cheap spices they use. 

God bless!"}
{"text":"Not very experienced with Persian cuisine, but my cousin is so I thought I would surprise her and her workmate here. Thumbs up! Loved the yogurt/dill/cucumber appetizer and freshly made on-site pita bread, as well as the other appetizer made from eggplant. I had the beef kabob and lavosh combo; my guests opted for chicken kabobs and rice. They LOVED the rice and the flavor of the kabobs. To top it off, we tried the saffron ice cream which was flavored with rosewater. This was to DIE for and we came back a few days later for a take out order of more ice cream!"}
{"text":"This place is great... Its the cleanest restaurant you will find west of the Strip!!! Even the bathrooms. There is a window to the kitchen and you can see its perfectly clean... On to the food... Got the Chicken Koobideh on grilled Sangak bread. Wow it was good!!! It doesn't seem like a lot of food but it is. So don't let the pictures fool you. They show pictures so that you won't be surprised at what you get if you've not eaten this type of food before (plus the descriptions don't totally match the pictures... No skewers for your kids to impale themselves or others on). My wife got the same with rice....Just as good! 

Oh try the homemade iced tea! It's not on the menu but it's fantastic!

The music is great too, as is the decor... 

Worth a visit. Now it's my go to for take out for my wife when I swing by Harbour Freight on the way home!"}
{"text":"After years of not finding a good Persian restaurant we found Aria!  Took my Persian hubby and it impressed him.

A well decorated and clean restaurant with the nicest staff. The food was superb and reasonably priced. 

While it is a distance from Henderson NV where we live - my husband leaned across the table and said \"I think we could drive here 2 times a"}
{"text":"I had the chicken and beef koobideh combo w/half salad and half rice (instead of a full rice order). My intent was to eat half for lunch, then finish off the remaining half for dinner, but that didn't happen. I DEVOURED it! In fact, I haven't stopped thinking about my meal. Definitely paying them a lunch visit tomorrow to try their sultani, pomegranate and walnut stew, and maybe the eggplant dip. 

Let me tell you this: the rice alone is worth going there. Everything is cooked to perfection, but the rice? OH-EM-GEE! The rice is lightly salted, seperate, fluffy, and buttery. Persian rice at its best, for sure! 

So glad I found Aria!"}
{"text":"1. They changed the name to Hafez. 
 Wonderful. The 8 yr old said ,'It's the best place in the world.'  We have never eaten Persian food before. This was excellent. We got a large player of kabobs. Grilled tomato and Serrano peppers along side.  Loved the different flavors. Served with raw white onion with a spice shaken over it and rice with saffron. 
Sometimes when you try a new food it is just too different to judge if you like it or not? Not tonight! I squeezed lemon over everything, added the onion and my mouth was smiling. 
We had twin 2year olds and an 8 year old with us. I couldn't believe how much the twins gobbled up! They kept eating and eating. 
Don't forget dessert- baklava and saffron,rose & pistachio ice cream. The ice cream was so so different, nothing like I've ever had before. I couldn't stop eating it. A little too different for the children so they devoured the baklava instead, leaving ice cream for us adults. 
The owner was gracious and made us feel comfortable.  
I'm giving it a 5star because it's one of those restaurants I want to encourage. The tiny obscure gems that serve excellent food without the pretense. Real food. 
Only happy faces and empty plates left this restaurant."}
{"text":"If you come to  las Vegas, please try Hafez Persian food it was the best I have ever had. Rashin was super nice and very professional. She was taking care of all the customer on the best way .I love her ."}
{"text":"I won't go anywhere else for Persian food in Vegas. I love this place and the food is great.  Very clean and the owners are wonderful."}
{"text":"Great experience and great food....the greatest recipe for success! This restaurant is well run by a great family that cares about every detail of their process! Glad we stopped here, will have to return at every chance!"}
{"text":"Hmmmmmm...where to start?  


Thanks to Aria, I'm able to enjoy quality Persian food at my home away from home...Vegas!!  

Food - excellent:
Had the chicken kabob. Chicken was soft and juicy, rice was buttery and moist, and the veggies were grilled on the outside but not over cooked on the inside. 
Also had the hummus. The pita was fresh, not stale, as was the hummus. Got crisp, bright garlic and lemon flavored from the hummus but wasn't over powering such that I could still taste the chick peas...perfect in my opinion.

Ambiance - interesting:
There were lots of period Persian decorations on the walls. The overall interior was clean and well kept with an overwhelmingly beautiful aroma that hits you right when you open the door!  

Service - outstanding:
I called the order in but had some issues ordering as the menu on Yelp does not display the item number. Fortunately, the woman that took my order was extremely patient with me. She even re-confirmed my order when I arrived just to make sure I got exactly what I ordered. 

Price - reasonable:
Let's be honest, Persian food ain't cheap. In fact, I'm kind of used to paying $15.99 for a skinny skewer of chicken and a toasted tomato wedge. So, paying $13 for a huge plate of bomb kabob is a deal for me. 

Cliff's notes:

Awesome food, interesting interior, friendly and patient staff, and good prices. I felt like I was back in the Bay...in Vegas!"}
{"text":"One of the best place I ever went , staffs are kind and welcoming, foods are awesome I recommend this restaurant to everyone yummy"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Persian food in Vegas. Family run atmosphere and friendly service. Quality of food is excellent and they really take care of you on portions. Eat in or take out, both options are excellent. Really glad I discovered this place."}
{"text":"Great Persian food. You get bang for your buck. Staff are so friendly. You can have great food for 18 dollars. This restaurant is family owned and they care about their costumer.
Quality of the food is excellent. Hostess is so polite and respectful. You should defiantly try it."}
{"text":"We are from Tucson, Arizona, and just ate at this fantastic restaurant. The service was excellent and the food fresh and delicious. We come to Las Vegas once a year and we will now make this restaurant one of our stops every year in the future. We started with the barley soup and the Shirazi salad. The barley soup was a good consistency without being too tomato-y. The saffron rice was amazing and perfect. The koobideh was fresh and juicy as were the lamb chops. Our server was attentive and very friendly.  We plan to come back again soon!"}
{"text":"I've tried a few Persian places around Vegas and non have hit the spot.. But this place is really miles ahead of the rest! Very tasty food.. Definitely going to return each time I come to Vegas!"}
{"text":"My favorite place for koobideh. We drive all the way from Henderson to eat here.

Their food is great and service as well. 

I love the tahdig. 

I just wish it was closer to my house I'd be there all the time!"}
{"text":"Best Middle Eastern restaurant in Nevada !! All spices and flavors on point !! From the lemonade to all the main dishes!! Great place !! Great service"}
{"text":"This truly authentic Persian food, Warm friendly staff and excellent food. Very reasonably priced for the quality and portion  size, I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Wanted to try some Persian food in Vegas to reminisce on moms cooking. I try to eat Persian food whenever I travel (#tadig). 

Left the LV strip on an uber and it took about 15 min to travel the ~7 mile journey from Las Vegas Blvd. Arrived at the place around 615pm for dinner and noticed how empty the place was. There was only a family there besides us. The place is located in a strip mall that seems mostly uninhabited. 

We decided to order the half/half tadig as an appetizer (half gheymeh half ghorme sabzi of course). We ordered a chicken Sultani and and a standard soltani as our entrees. 

Service was great and the food was fantastic. I definitely recommend leaving the strip to give this place a go. The food has me drooling again just 24 hrs later and I will definitely return here. 

Keep in mind the signs outside say \"Hafez\" in the windows which had me thinking we came to the wrong place but Aria is the restaurants name.

Do yourself a favor and check this place out. Although the best kabobs are in LA, this place beats out anything I've had East of the Mississippi..."}
{"text":"This review is based only on take out. I ordered a couple of times from this place and the food was really good. The place is nice and clean inside. Seems like it a family run which is nice."}
{"text":"This was the first time I ever went to a Persian restaurant. All of the people in my group (three of us) asked a lot of questions. The waitress was very patient and answered all of the questions with a smile. We all ordered a variation of skewers, two with boneless chicken and one had the steak and chicken combination. For starters, one of us ordered a salad, one the hummus, and I ordered the Mast o Moosir which is yogurt with dill and seasonings. The hummus and yogurt dip came with a huge piece of freshly made flat bread. It's called sangak bread. It was so amazing that a couple of us ordered another piece of it to take home. The appetizer sizes were very generous. Both were delicious. The salad covered an entire dinner size plate and was piled nearly three inches high in the middle. The dinner portions are quite large, too. You get the meat with a lot of rice. You have the option of getting half of the rice and a house salad if you prefer it. The rice has some saffron rice on top of it. It is rather bland, but after adding just a little bit of salt and this amazing seasoning that comes in a sprinkler container on the table it was fantastic. The chicken and steak are well seasoned and delicious. The chicken was all breast meat which I liked. The meal comes with a chunk of raw onion, lime, a grilled tomato, and a grilled serrano pepper. I was so glad we picked this place. We had been looking for something new to try in Yelp. Most people will have enough leftovers for another meal. If you have the chance, give this place a try. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Growing up with my dad making Iranian food all the time, this is definitely the closest to home cooking! Delicious appetizers, tasty dinners beautiful people, wonderfully kind personal service."}
{"text":"I've had Aria Mediterranean bookmarked for several months and I stopped in for a late lunch/early dinner after a program in DTLV.  I was immediately greeted and seated and given a menu and asked about a drink.  I ordered their homemade iced tea.  

I started with a small bowl of barley soup which was very hot (temperature) and very good.

I wanted to try something different for the entrée, so I ordered the Fesenjan, a dish the menu describes in this way: Finely chopped walnuts stirred into pomegranate molasses with chicken (cooked for 12 hours).  The dish was very good and was something entirely different.  There is a sweetness to it from the pomegranate molasses but there's also a tang to the dish.  A wedge of white onion was served and I sliced this in small pieces to mix with the fesenjan to take away some of the sweetness of the dish.  The chicken cubes were fork tender and the rice with the chicken and fesenjan sauce was really good food.

I opted for some Persian style baklava for dessert.  It was very good and like almost everything they serve, made in house.

Service was excellent.  My being there was appreciated by the pleasant way I was treated during the meal and when I opted to pay at the pick up window if you've ordered take out.  The chef thanked me from the kitchen for stopping in.

I'll be going back some Sunday soon because I want to try one of their dishes that is only served on Sunday."}
{"text":"One of the best Persian restaurants in Vegas. Great customer service and superb food. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"First off, I can't believe I've waited so long to review this gem. I've been coming here for years and not once have I been disappointed. Do yourself a favor and try the Lamb Shank- it's outstanding. Super juicy, cooked to perfection and served with a rice of mixed baby lima beans and dill. It's like bone-in Mexican Birria... but better( excluding my mom's birria of course!)"}
{"text":"Ate there last night. The food is very good. Large portions and reasonably priced. The owners are very nice and polite as well. Definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service. They are sooo nice. Family run place. Quality of food is exceptional. Not expensive either. Love it."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Mediterranean food in this restaurant was above and beyond my expectation. The food came fast and it was delicious so I very recommend this place to anyone that want to Mediterranean style food in a small in quality"}
{"text":"In Vegas for a conference and had a couple of colleagues from Oklahoma that wanted to try Persian food and after a little research decided on this place. They are wonderful!! Great food, great service and the freshly baked bread is to die for. Definitely come try this place weather you're a local or a tourist."}
{"text":"Amazing Persian food in Vegas !! Went after a week of hiking and loved the kabobs and rice. Can't lose here !"}
{"text":"Finally, a Persian restaurant with good Ghormeh Sabzi! They have good tadig, too! I went in later in the evening and the owners were Very sweet and helpful. The beef koobideh is tasty. I will definitely come back and I highly recommend!

It is hard to find good Persian places to eat in Vegas....found one!"}
{"text":"Tried them out for the first time today and hands down it was the best authentic tasting Persian food in Vegas. Great looking place also!!! Definitely will go back also was told they have dizi Thursday n Friday. AWESOME!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first experience with Persian dishes.  Food was great and we didn't have to wait too long.   Will definitely return"}
{"text":"Chicken koobideh and beef combo were delicious. The fresh bread is so delicious and the chicken is moist.  If nothing else, you should definitely come for the tea... OMG the tea is delicious with a couple or more cubes of sugar.  We come from So Cal and this is better than many of the Persian restaurants we're accustomed to going.  Makes you feel at home.  We really enjoyed coming here and we hope to become consistent patrons in the near future."}
{"text":"Real Five Star Place! The Best Persian restaurant in Las Vegas, supper friendly staff. I loved the Bakhtiari Kabab and you must try their ice cream"}
{"text":"Truly an authentic Persian restaurant and not blended with other Mediterranean cuisine! They serve the traditional tahdig, a traditional Persian rice dish yellowed from the saffron addition. I had it with half gheymeh and half ghormeh stew. The beef is so tender! 

One of my favorite drinks is doogh, a yogurt drink flavored with mint. This was served in a tall glass and refills were complimentary. It's hard to find not served from a bottle!

Seating outside is also available. 

Service from my waitress was excellent."}
{"text":"Great food! Second time here and I'm continued to be impressed! The boyfriend really enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"I recently had my engagement party here. What a great event made better by excellent support and awesome food. I love this place. Not expensive and better sit down restaurant experience. You will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Its owned by a sweet couple who were more than happy to explain the menu and even showed us an example of what the meal looked like prior to us ordering. We have never had this type of cuisine before, but our waitress was wonderful in explaining everything because we had a few questions. The tea had so much flavor, and we tried the doogh drink. Its a flavor we were unfamiliar with, but it was nice to try something new. Drinks were served with sugar cubes.

Our meals were very good in size and priced accordingly. My dad ordered the stew and it had more flavor than any other we have had. It was also very hearty and had a side of rice. The number 9 was big enough to share comfortably between two adults, and it was arguably the best tasting chicken I've ever had. I wish I knew how they seasoned it.

I would highly recommend this place to a friend, and I'll probably be back to share this restaurant find with my boyfriend, since we are on a mission to try new foods this year :) 

The other thing, during the time we ate in the restaurant, it had filled up with other Mediterranean families, which showed us that it really must be authentic and true to the flavors of their native country."}
{"text":"My friend and I had lentil soup and ice cream on March 7, 2018 and we both got sick.  I registered a complaint with the S. Nevada Health District!

When I called the restaurant they hung up on me....HOW MUCH LONGER CAN THEY STAY IN BUSINESS????????????????????????"}
{"text":"If your mother makes amazing Persian kabob, you will probably think this place doesn't compare. With that being said, I did still like the broiled chicken. The baklava was the best I have ever had and the service was good!"}
{"text":"Aria Mediterranean Restaurant serves excellent Persian Food!!!  The food is so authentic!  The grilled meats are so flavorful and tender.  The rice so fluffy and moist.  

Rashin, the lady who serves the food is so nice and friendly.  

Only regret I have is that I did not know about this restaurant sooner.  I highly recommend Aria!"}
{"text":"Excellent food... the smell walking in got me and the taste of food is amazing... definitely coming back... thank u"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service! The ghormeh sabzi is the best here. The family that owns the business is always there and working hard. My family has used them for catering and they have been punctual and fantastic."}
{"text":"Took almost one hour to get our dinner. They were just their plate meals. Don't come here if you are hungry."}
{"text":"My husband and I have gone to Aria a few times now and they never disappoint. We always start with the hummus and pita bread for appetizer. Then the chicken and beef combo. But best dish goes to the blackened salmon.
Service is very good too. Over-all 5 stars is well deserved. We will keep going back."}
{"text":"First time here! (02/22/2018) A friend recommended this place. 
OMG the food was delicious! I had lamb chops with beef and rice/salad.. I honestly cannot remember the names .. but my table had 5 different items from the menu, and all were DELISH!  Everything had flavor. And that flavor I will remember for awhile. 

The restaurant is clean, the servers were attentive.. may have a little bit of attitude, but all over nice. They accommodated allergies and everything. I'm definitely  going to come back to this gem !"}
{"text":"One nice Persian Restuarant in Las Vegas, family owned and it's like eating at home, so fresh and tasty, will definitely come again in my next visit."}
{"text":"Good little Middle Eastern restaurant.  Good service. Great hummus served with a type of bread that I had not had before (it was sort of like naan, but not quite).  My entrée was also good.  Only negative comment I have is that their lamb dishes are a bit pricey IMHO.  This place is a bit far away from my home so I may not return, but I do recommend it."}
{"text":"Best Persian food in Las Vegas area. I moved from Burbank CA which is known for best Persian food. I was looking for similar standard and found this one."}
{"text":"Definitely worth coming just absolutely delicious and our waitress Noosh was a total sweetheart and very accommodating......best kabobs by far!!"}
{"text":"This mom and pop shop is welcoming and friendly. The restaurant is clean and prices are on par with some of the other spots in town. I ordered the chicken and beef koobideh with rice. Both were flavorful and well seasoned but I didn't really care for the giant chunk of raw onion on my plate. Do the public a service by packing gum and breath mints if you plan on devouring that."}
{"text":"Amazing lamb dish called beryooni, never heard of it before was the Sunday special. Totally worth the trip!"}
{"text":"It's almost shocking that such high-quality food and a lovely, casual setting can be hidden away in a seemingly deserted Las Vegas strip mall. In fact, this is the second great restaurant hiding in plain sight around the corner from our hounds' vet (Rainbow Animal Hospital!), the other being the also-family-owned-and-run and also-excellent Mexican restaurant Serrano's.

In this case, Aria serves delicious Persian food. I tried the non-vegetarian version of the Eggplant Gheymeh Stew. It was tasty, filling, and just what I needed. The less daring of us ordered a chicken kabob and rice, and I was surprised to find myself with extreme entree envy: the charbroiled chicken chunks were out-of-this world! I would have happily switched plates despite thoroughly enjoying my own order. I can see myself easily becoming addicted to the chicken. Based on the number of to-go orders we saw, I assume I'm not the only one.

Aria has a lot of space, and tables, for a small, family-run restaurant. The decor is simple, but warm. On Friday night, a half hour before closing, the only staff seemed to be the couple who own the place, with the woman serving, and the man cooking. They were managing the steady stream of business quite well, but given that the food is made to order, and that it's extremely well executed, Aria is more conducive to a relaxing meal rather than a quick bite.

Prices seemed quite reasonable for the quality and quantity of the dishes. It was particularly nice to get my salad fix, in this case, a Shirazi (cucumber) salad, for only $4.

As we were leaving, I noticed an inviting outdoor dining area even more tucked away than the restaurant itself. I don't know when those garden tables are open, but I can imagine having a fantastic time dining out there."}
{"text":"Came to Las Vegas with my cousin and found this great Persian Restaurant and i have to say it was one of the best Persian food i've had, i got the Bakhtiyari Kabob which is combination of Chicken kabob and Beef Kabob, great costumer service 5 star!!!!!"}
{"text":"The service has really gone down hill. Young server hates her job and it shows. Hardly comes around and had an unpleasant attitude. The food was good but when the service is disrespectful, you ain't coming back. Minus two stars for service."}
{"text":"It's been such a looooooooooong time since I had great Persian food.  This has to one if the best in Las Vegas...price is right the food is stupendous!!!  Service a little slow but you never rush perfection.
Don't let the little hole in a wall disway you...great place the beef and chicken kabob is still lingering in my mouth...the baklava was AWESOME
Can't wait till next time but next time a get 3 kabobs"}
{"text":"This little mom and pop place has a small menu, but what we had was made well. It seems like a husband and wife that run this place.

The hubby and I shared a hummus to start. We were given just 1 pita for it, but if you need more you can get some. The lady asked us if we needed more and she brought us another warm pita. Sides are really nicely priced at $3.50 that get a few to share to make yourself some meze platter.

We both got a 1 chicken and 1 beef koobideh plate. It comes with rice, grilled pepper, grilled tomato, some onions and butter for your rice. The koobideh was pretty juicy and well seasoned. I am hit or miss with chicken ones, but theirs was solid though both the hubby and I preferred the beef kind.

We ordered one square of baklava to share. Theirs wasn't overly sweet and the nuts were toasted nicely. Not bad at all. 

The lady who was serving us was kind and a very humble and gracious type of host. 

Kebabs are one of those things where I see the prices severely swing from cheap to spendy for some ground meat and rice. This place has good quality, good portions and the prices make it for cheap eats when $10 gets you a pile of food. 

I dig it. Many good kebab spots aren't convenient to us so I'm really glad that there is something in the area were normally around. The shopping center is rather quiet so I hope that they get enough traffic to stay open because I think the food is really good homey food."}
{"text":"Good Persian food with quality basmati rice. Fast and friendly service. Reasonable prices.  
I highly recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!!!   I'm a typical white American guy and I love this authentic Persian Food.  The ingredients and preparation are top notch.  

The place was packed for a reason."}
{"text":"What a cool place.  I've been coming here a lot lately and there is always a man and a woman that work there.  I'm assuming they're are married but not sure.  They are soooooooo nice.   The food is awesome.  And they have Wifi, lol.   Overall a really good vibe.  It's kind of tucked away in a shopping center on the corner but definitely worth a visit.  It looks like they have an outdoor patio attached, although I don't think I've seen anyone use it.   Maybe it's still too hot outside.   Try a dish called \"fesenjoon\". It's chicken made with palmogranite sauce, honey and walnuts.  It's a stew.  Really dark in color but tastes amazing!!"}
{"text":"Came here on Memorial Day at the suggestion of an Iranian friend of mind who had recently relocated to Vegas . I ordered the mixed koobideh ( chicken and beef ) plate with sangak . It came out to be about 12 dollars . The beef and the chicken after dusted with lime juice was pretty good . I think it measures up to the average Iranian kabob place in LA where my friend and I are from .( 3.7 stars)

The sangak however was exceptional!!( 4.1 stars )

And the price is right!!!  ( 4.0 stars )

-----
The rice which my friend ordered was nothing spectacular . ( 2.0 stars )  mind you I am  comparing it to the arguably one of the best Persian establishments in the west coast ( raffis place) get the sangak instead ."}
{"text":"Kobideh was great,very home made style food, fresh bread, overall loved it. they make bread right there at the store.good and friendly service"}
{"text":"I love the chicken koobideh! Paired with the sangak wheat bread and tomato, it is a perfect meal. The room is comfortable and service is friendly. However, on our visit, both the chicken and beef shish kebabs, served over basmati rice, were over-cooked and dry. But that koobideh! I can't wait to return to have it again."}
{"text":"My Vegas trip completed with visiting and enjoying the meal of this restaurant. Fresh food, great customer service. Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"Ate here with our kids and everyone really enjoyed what they ordered.  The yogurt appetizer with cucumber was excellent and we used the sauce on our kabobs."}
{"text":"Due to the great reviews I wanted to give Aria a try since I do like Persian food and I do have a go to place when I'm in town but always looking for new spots. 

It's fairly a small cozy restaurant, a mom and pop place with who I assume was the waitress their daughter. This is just a guess. I ordered the combo chicken and beef kabob (kubideh) the portions were good with a roasted tomato and a roasted jalepeno, it came with a chunk of raw onion which I wish was roasted like the tomato. The flavor was very good. This place was a bit more pricey compared to other persian restaurants in Las Vegas for their entrees.

I also ordered the egg plant dip, kashkeh bademjoon. It was tasty and I know a very healthy dish. It came with 2 warm pita bread but my only complaint is that it should have come with at least 3 or 4 pita bread in my opinion to finish off the dip. The bread and dip ratio was off, not enough bread for the dip. Also $2 extra charge for 2 more pita bread which I thought was a bit just for bread. When it wasnt house made.

Overall a good meal with tip my meal was $39 (20 percent tip) The service was very good."}
{"text":"That's outstanding! Really the food quality was Amazing ! Specially the kabobs were fantastic! I offer you to test their \"Doogh\" drink and special yogurt + cucumber!! Other wise you'll miss a fantastic experience! 
Moreover, their attitudes and behavior is absolutely peerless ! They are very warm , intimate and polite ! I'm so happy to get familiar with such a fantastic Persian restaurant."}
{"text":"Very good food , amazing friendly service 
Love the atmosphere with Persian song 
Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Not familiar with the area -turned to Yelp for help and was not disappointed. Great service and the most amazing food. Had the chicken kabob- moist and flavorful. The iced tea had a slight hint of cinnamon and was delicious. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food, amazing service, and great ambiance!  The rice is so good and the chicken kabobs are so flavorful!  The waitress was incredibly nice and accommodating.  They even do to go!"}
{"text":"Hands down they have the best persian food I've ever. Love this place. You really should try this place out. Everyone is so nice here."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time visiting this place. I order the lentil soup and the chicken kabob soltani. The food was great and so was the staff. The place is clean and spacious and very welcoming. The price is reasonable for the quality and also the large portion they serve."}
{"text":"Again, I wasn't disappointed. We have been back here at least 6 times.  The food is consistently great. No surprises. Just great flavors, excellent service and a comfortable atmosphere"}
{"text":"Fairly hidden in a strip mall but worth seeking out. Fresh baked bread in a traditional oven served piping hot. Have it with the hummus or other appetizers. Yum!

Always interesting to sample the kabobs and get their take on this classic recipe: ground beef, onions, salt, pepper and saffron. Their koobideh is super juicy and the basmati rice is heavenly in its fluffiness. I like that their food overall is not overly salty.

The lentil soup has a tomato base that was overpowering so it tasted more like a tomato soup - good but I would not order again. 

Can't wait to try the fesenjan and other items in the extensive menu.
Happy to support this local and family run eatery."}
{"text":"This is one of the best local restaurants food-wise in Las Vegas.  The shish kabobs are outstanding.  The hummus awesome.  A Persian restaurant w/truck stop servings and reasonable prices, the salads, rice, appetizers and entrees are all gr8 choices.  The server and the baklava could be improved, the former less nuttier, the latter more nuttier."}
{"text":"Great service. Kind employees. Food is very good and fresh. Bread is made on the spot. Highly recommend and will bring my family here"}
{"text":"I'm a bit conflicted, because the service was very nice, and perhaps it was just the one item I got, but the day after having the Eggplant Gheymeh Stew, I had symptoms consistent with having eaten something with sodium nitrate in it, which would suggest lower food quality. The stew tasted ok, I would say not the best Persian food that I've had but good enough to get four stars. I can't say for certain that it was the meal I had but I do think it was. I'm sure other items on the menu would work better though."}
{"text":"Now called hafez, I really like this place. I was greeted by the most amazing smell of herbs and spices when I walked in. The food tasted homemade and was very fresh.  You know the bread is fresh because you can watch them make it! And the portions are large. I think the key is that my pickier than picky husband said he wants to come back."}
{"text":"I had the koobideeh, masta musir, and chelo kabab. The meat was very tasty and tender. The rice was very well cooked. 

I was raised on persian food, and the food here is top notch. Dont know how anyone gave it less then 4 stars."}
{"text":"Love the food, good service, easy to park. Kobideh was great, very home made style food, fresh bread, overall loved it."}
{"text":"This is my first time here to Aria and the fresh mint the fresh basil the tabouli  the lamb are all excellent and what a wonderful ambience with music and great service"}
{"text":"This is a good sit down and take out Medittarranean cuisine. I had chicken kabob. It was perfect and plenty. The service was good. I recommend this place highly."}
{"text":"I always judge a Persian restaurant by their koobideh, Aria's koobideh was amazing!"}
{"text":"Ok I read few comments on uelp and devided to give a chance to this place and guess what I was so disappointed with everything maybe it was a bad day for them in a restaurant or it was something else I dont know all I know is that servers ware pretty much slow and didn't take care of my table at all... I cant recommend this place to anybody maybe its just my expirience but I will stay with one star and very dissaponted!"}
{"text":"I find the food here excellent and it is a great value.  I order their Chicken and Beef Koobideh to go often.  The husband and wife team are very nice and always have a smile on their faces!  It is next to Harbor Freight."}
{"text":"Excellent food & service.  Read reviews on yelp & was very accurate with food & hospitality."}
