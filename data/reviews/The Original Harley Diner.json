{"text":"The Original Harley Diner is in the South East Harley dealership. The food is what you would expect from a diner but you should come to the diner for the experience. I give this place 5 stars since it is a unique experience.   The diner is a 1948 diner moved to Ohio in 1989 and built into the Harley dealerships building. The owner has done a great job keeping the original look and feel of the building. The kitchen is a traditional open format.   If you can sit in the diner but the seating is limited (there is more seating around the structure)."}
{"text":"Wow thank you Yelp for this hidden eclectic discovery very close to our place!  When I say hidden that is no joke, first the actual diner is an original that was moved from Mew Hampshire to continue service from inside the Harley Dealership with a mini museum that includes one of Elvis Presley's original bikes!!! What???? How cool is that!  Second, the posting in Yelp says the diner opens at 11am but it actually opens at 10am-2pm.  We came for breakfast but that stops at 11am weekdays (longer on weekends).  The waitress and cooks were SO nice to cook us breakfast anyway.  I had the Denver skillet and my husband the Denver omelette.  Pretty much the same thing but mine is scrambled and his was folded - lol.  Typical diner style with American cheese but the Coffee was hot, fresh and well brewed.  The prices are fare and the selection while limited for breakfast (no pancakes or home fries weekdays) the lunch menu is also limited and traditional burgers, fries, shakes and sandwiches.   We are coming back to try out the burgers soon!"}
{"text":"You should give the diner back to Rochester, New Hampshire!  What was to be a great lunch with my hard working son turned out to be lies & bullshit. Ordered a few burgers on our break from work.After 20 minutes the waiter came and said sorry for the delay, food will be right up!. Another 20 minutes goes by and they serve burgers to the couple seated behind us that came in 15 minutes after me.I asked how they got served before me and the waiter replied he was sorry again & they were just patting me out fresh burgers............ Thanks for the bullshit lies.We went late back to the job-site with out eating any lunch........ I wouldn't trust this place for anything.  Screw This Place!"}
{"text":"My husband purchased a Harley Motorcycle from this dealership, a year, or so ago, so we sometimes stop in for merchandise etc.  The dealership staff is always super-nice, but this was the first time we had an opportunity to eat at the diner, and OMG, we should have done it sooner:-)   We were seated immediately and very slyly eyed other patron's entrees as we were escorted to our table.  I ordered the grilled chicken and my husband ordered the BLT.  My sandwich was hot, fresh and seasoned nicely, with a nice side of handcut fries.  My husband equally enjoyed his BLT.  We will absolutely re-visit the Diner!"}
{"text":"Kinda odd, but we were pleasantly surprised! This is a full-fledged diner that they moved into a Harley dealership. Good amount of food, good quality of food, good price for food. Not much interest in Harley motorcycles, personally, but worth the visit and we'll be back for the food!"}
{"text":"First time here and had chance to try out breakfast. Very limited menu foe breakfast. Our waitress could see our struggle and told us that could also do choice of meat,eggs,toast and potato cakes. So both ordered that.  Scrambled, potato cakes and extra crispy bacon and rye toast.  A lot of food and was really good. Service was friendly. When explained that this was our first time here she gave menu and said must come back for their imfamous burgers. Definitely on our list"}
