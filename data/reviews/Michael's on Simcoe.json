{"text":"Food: Ordered a medium-well 16. oz bone-in tenderloin. Received it medium-rare. Delicious, except it could have used less salt as it overpowered most of the other flavours. Sad to see a prime cut go to waste because of over salting; therefore it was not worth the price paid. The wild Irish salmon was overcooked, but the flavour was exceptional.  The lobster and ravioli lacked any noticeable flavour, it was bland and the saffron sauce could have been reduced further. 

Service: A bit slow, considering it wasn't fully booked. Servers looked like they were running around with their hair on fire. They could have been more hospitable. Hostesses were cheerful and inviting.

Overall: In such a competitive area for fine dining, I expected more from Micheal's. Amazing decor, warm atmosphere, but it felt as if the chef did not care for the things coming out of the kitchen. The one thing you don't do is send out food over/undercooked, especially in a restaurant of this caliber. Because of this, I will not be dining here again."}
{"text":"Started out with the lobster bisque and it was very tasty.  Didn't care for the seafood spread that came with it.  The steak was very good - no need for any sauce with it.  I ordered Brussel sprouts and the Cauliflower gratin as side dishes and both were very good.  I will definitely be back.  The music in the bar was also great!"}
{"text":"Was here on a Thursday night, popped in for dinner with two friends and sat at the bar. Have to say it was one of the best meals I've had, the steaks and the beef carpaccio were outstanding! Thanks to Michael and the great staff."}
{"text":"Great restaurant has a huge variety of steaks but as well has pasta and seafood. Great place to eat and I definetly recommend it. May be pricey but the quality is worth it"}
{"text":"3.5/5 for food - good food
1.0/5 for service - the server was rude and ignorant. He passed on a few comments on our menu choices and not necessarily good ones. The ignorance continued till the last course until he brought the bill - at this point he was a different person. We felt like as if he was the customer and we were the servers. Despite his bad service, I talked nice to him thinking he will provide a better service as we go from First course to second - but nope, service did not change at all. The restaurant was not busy therefore I don't understand the bad service - there were some people beginning to gather next to our table for an event ( possibly a birthday dinner). 

Food was great, service was horrendous, I wouldn't go back there again."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I have never written a review for anything before, but Michael's on Simcoe blew me away. Not only is the food amazing (and yes, like everyone else has said, Michael's by far has best steak in the city), but the staff is one of a kind. So friendly and welcoming. 

Side note: beet salad = best thing ever !"}
{"text":"The menu is very convoluted...Italian resto or Steakhouse....what are you??
Service was fine and the decor is lovely but the food was average at best.
I do not mind paying $42 for a 8oz Filet or extra for the sides but I asked for rare, not Pittsburgh blue (burnt and raw).The quality of the steak was good but Barberians or Jacobs is much better for the same price. Dinner service was not that busy there should be no reason that my onion rings arrived cold...there were more than enough staff to bring those from the kitchen hot. Mac and Cheese was way too truffled....it literally stunk up our whole section. I am not sure who is in the kitchen but it is not good. Ruth's Chris is half a block away...go there...better food....better service.....classic steakhouse!!"}
{"text":"OK, so I don't usually write restaurant reviews (as I work in one and think that they are usually an unfair and extremely biased attack) but this was the ABSOLUTE BEST DINING EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER HAD!!!! From the time we sat down until we finished our last sip, everything was simply AMAZING! Upon entering, we were promptly greeted by the owner Michael and the general manager Neil. My girlfriend and I chose to sit in the bar area as we are both bartenders and love to watch them work. Right away I noticed how clean and modern the place looked and felt. Upon sitting down, Neil took our drink order and the night began. I ordered a Paper Plane (I order because I love it and because I like to test the bartending staff on their knowledge on classic(ish) cocktails) and she absolutely NAILED it! Perfection in a glass. She even asked me if I wanted it on the rocks (as it is traditionally served straight up in a coupe) and I said yes (because I love it that way). Such a great effort! Food was INCREDIBLE! I was eating things I would never eat and they all tasted GREAT! The steak was perfection in meat form. If you try anything there, order something to do with steak because that was INCREDIBLE!! Neil helped us pair wine with our dishes for a really in depth and explorative dining experience. Michael checked in on us and promptly said that if we needed anything, that he would make it happen. WOW!! We finished with this desert that blew both myself and my girlfriend away. I can't remember what it was but there was fire and marshmallow and AMAZING! I was stuffed but I couldn't stop eating! 
Honestly, anyone who is looking for the BEST (STEAK) RESTAURANT in Toronto, GO TO MICHAEL'S ON SIMCOE! GO THERE!!! You will have one of (if not) the BEST dining experiences of your life. You guys have to give it a try. Also, I am a whisky freak and their selection is Fantastic!!! They have bottles that NOBODY CAN GET! Seriously, check it out! You wont be disappointed!! Thank you Michael and to your staff, you have rekindled my love for dining out!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, amazing service, great experience! Highly recommend this place for any occasion."}
{"text":"I was here with my boyfriend a few weeks ago and the waiter was absolutely horrible. As soon as we got there the waiter only paid attention to my boyfriend (since it was clear he was paying the bill at the end) I was virtually ignored all night. The food was OK, not bad but nothing to rave about... at the end, once the bill was paid our waiter did a 180 on my boyfriend as well, was rude to both of us, took our desert plate away before we had even finished as if he just wanted us to leave so he could get the next table in for his next tip. Personally I had never been so disrespected in a high end restaurant and have no plans on ever returning."}
{"text":"Food - Very good 4.5/5 
Australian Wagyu with lobster tail, roasted cauliflower, french fries. Steak cooked perfectly, plating a little boring

Service - 2.5/5 
Always nice to have a rapport with server especially at a place this pricey. We had 3-4 different servers, wasn't terrible but we've had better service at Swiss Chalet or Keg to be honest.

Experience - 1.5/5
So here was our issue.  Booked reservations several days in advance only for them to tell us the dining room was full and they would have to seat us in the lounge. What?? A reservation i would think meant i reserved a table in the dining room...not the area where ppl can walk in hangout to drink and watch the game! 
We literally had the worst table in the place. Quite disappointing considering we spent over $600. 
Also note, that they don't like to split the bill and they'll let you know.  I'm guessing if Morgan Freeman or any other celebrity had dinner here and requested a bill split it would probably happen.(not that they would do that!) 

At this price point you are paying for great food, great service and a great experience. Unfortunately Michael's on Simcoe falls short. 
Consider Jacobs and Co. and Harbour Sixty."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great atmosphere. Can always count on Michael and his amazing staff."}
{"text":"This is my favourite restaurant in the city. So much so that i find myself there almost every Thursday night for a girls night. The food is incredible, beef carpaccio is a must have. Vibe, atmosphere and lighting are very important to me as well and Michaels on simcoe nails it!!"}
{"text":"Food was nothing to brag about. Staff are fairly attentive. However, the owner is extremely rude, he is more fit to run a Tim Horton. We had a reservation for 9, booked and confirmed. Had to wait 40 minutes to be seated. His explanation and I quote \"if you going out on a Saturday you should expect to wait\". The only reason we stayed was because we already had the wine decanted. 
P.s. Apparently the bathrooms are nice which tells you where the owners head at."}
{"text":"I really like the atmosphere at Michael's. It was beautifully decorated, and the music playing was great. A really nice place to have a dinner.

I was dining on my own, so sat at the bar. The house Malbec was a great drop. Well worth trying. Likewise the mashed potato was stunning. I had the seared tuna as my main, but it didn't live up to what I expected. Each element of the dish was nice, but overall just didn't work together. The greens and tomatoes were great, but the flavours were just too strong for the delicate tuna, which had no marinade.

Aside from this, I quite enjoyed the atmosphere, and everyone else seemed to enjoy their meals, so I would definitely give it another go with a different dish."}
{"text":"Started off the evening with delicious handcrafted cocktails featuring Chopin Potato vodka. Buratta cheese appetizer with sliced beet and apple salad was wonderful. Assortment of scallops, shrimp and octopus was outstanding. Entrees included the black cod and bone in rib eye. Both were perfectly cooked. Service was a good as you can get. Michael the owner and host came by a couple times to say hello and check on us. This is a must try if you are in Toronto."}
{"text":"Came here with two friends for Summerlicious. The first thing I noticed was the nice interior decor, pretty cozy setting. I'd consider this place a fine dining place. The menu has quite a nice selection - 4 choices of appetizer, main and dessert. It had a lot of fancy-sounding names that I'd never heard of, but the staff was most happy to explain what they were.

I got pasta for starters, a N.Y.striploin steak for the main and Semifreddo Croccante for the dessert. The pasta was ok - nice but nothing special. The striploin steak was especially good. It came with salsa verde, which I'm not used to, but the two went well together. I tried the Semifreddo Croccante out of curiosity. It was a bit too sweet for my liking. 

Service was exceptional. The waiters were attentive.. My friends and I spent a fair bit of time just chatting after our meal was done and they subtly gave us the bill without us asking for it. It was a Tuesday evening and the restaurant was maybe half-full so I didn't think they needed to \"rush\" us. 

A tiny annoyance though was when their debit/credit card machine had tip buttons of 20, 25, 30% but no 15% button and I had to pick the \"Other\" button and manually key in 15% for my tip. I tend to be annoyed when restaurants try to \"steer\" customers to tip a certain expected amount. 

Finally, my female friends had mentioned that the bathroom was very special. It apparently had \"smart toilets\" with all those gadgets and even a dryer for you down there. I didn't check out the men's toilet. 

OVERALL: This was a great opportunity to check out Michael's. The Summerlicious meal was reasonably priced and I was happy with my meal. However, I probably will not be returning post-Summerlicious unless it is for a very special occasion/event because it is just too expensive (for me anyway)."}
{"text":"I called the restaurant last week to make a reservation for summerlicious on a Sunday for 7 people. I had got the restaurant phone number off of the summerlicious website, therefore did not realize that the restaurant was closed on Sundays. Anyways, the staff member who picked up the phone confirmed our reservation. I have no idea why she would confirm it when the restaurant isn't even open on Sunday. Of course we showed up on Sunday after an hour of commute and realized the restaurant was closed. I sent an email to show that I was very disappointed but never received any response back. Very poor customer service on their part."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying i am sad that i didn't have dinner here sooner. The staff, the service, the ambiance and most importantly the food was incredible. They had live music which i loved ( most of the cities restaurants lack in this department) its was a nice touch to the ambiance. I am a huge foodie and i have been to several steak houses in the city with similar price points, and the food at Michaels was outstanding. I tried the mushroom risotto, Chicken stuffed tortellini, and the ricotta and mushroom filled pasta. All three were incredible. I also loved the diver scallops. The steak was the icing on the cake , extremely flavourful and cooked to perfection. I had my steak with a side of fries, cauliflower and brussel sprouts ( sprouts were to die for). For desert i had creme brûlée with fresh fruit and a raspberry sorbet!!!  I can't wait to go back and try more off the menu it was tough deciding what to pick because it all sounded so good! I highly recommend this gem, def one of my new top fav restaurant in the city. Not to mention the great location and valet service!!!!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night. Beautiful decor and ambiance. Server was a bit rushed but very pleasant. Felt like he was trying hard to remember his script and has to say it quick or he'd forget. But a nice man. Steak was delicious as were the blossoms. Overall a very nice evening."}
{"text":"I went to Michaels on Simcoe on a Friday evening with my boyfriend and another couple. We personally had amazing service from our waiter. The wine was amazing and the waiter showed my boyfriend and his friend the meat hanging and drying in the back (they were interested to see this). 

Our waiter was at our table frequently to see how we were doing. I would definitely say our experience with service was amazing. The environment is also very relaxing and chic. The lights are dimmed, and the atmosphere consisted of blue lighting. 

The best part, of course, was my meal. I had the Surf n Turf meal, which was cooked to perfection. It consisted of a scallop, a few shrimps, a piece of lobster, and a 6 oz piece o steak. It was to die for. I also had some Caesar salad, which was great also.
The bread they serve as an appetizer is moist, and is delicious when dipped in the balsamic/olive oil in the dish they bring you. There are many options for steak, and if you're looking for a good steak...this is definitely the place. There's even an option of a 16oz steak for $798 (haha that's the highest price of steak, most are significantly less expensive).

Now, if that's not good enough, the bathrooms are also pretty nice. If you're a woman you're in for a treat because the washroom had the best toilets ever. When you walk in the seats automatically lift up and are heated. There's a built-in bidet system where you can control the options (rear cleanse, front cleanse, drying, amongst other options). I gave it a try and the water is warm, not cold, so that's also nice. 

I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anybody who hasn't been and is thinking of trying it out."}
{"text":"Had an incredible experience last night. Outstanding meal and first class service. Michael stopped us on our way out the door, asked about our meal and treated us to a night cap and a great conversation. Michael and his staff went the extra mile to ensure we had a terrific time. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing, I have had steak at many many places and this one is by far tastiest. Usually I'll have steak rare, but this meat it is so good next time I'll have it blue. 
It's bit on a pricy side but if you want quality u gotta pay for it. 

Ambiance is really, really cool, lighting, music this place is really relaxing. There is lounge area where you can have drinks. 

Bathrooms are really modern and the cleanest you will ever see. 

If you wanna impress someone from out of town take them there."}
{"text":"Service is excellent. I have gone here many times and I am surprised that they never remember me. Steaks are fantastic. Anything on menu is great."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner yesterday and had a great experience.  We made reservations and were seated right away (15 minutes early in fact).  The ambiance is very cool.. dimly lit, purple accent lights.

We ordered from the Summerlicious Menu ($45)  The food was delicious.  We had the pasta and calamari to start - both were delicious.. pasta was probably a better choice (the portion was fairly large).  They also had a NY Striploin on the summerlicious menu (about 6oz) and was cooked perfectly.  The desserts were to die for (Semifreddo + Fruit Crumble).  

Our server was extremely friendly and knowledgeable.  We couldn't decide on a wine and wanted to just order different drinks but he offered to open up a few bottles just for us to try and if we didn't like it, we could order something else.

Overall great experience."}
{"text":"ate here with my buddies, one of the steak places in town we had not been to. I was skeptical at first as I am accustomed to traditional spots like Barberians (who I feel have lost their touch) Harbor Sixty , Hy's,Ruth Chris ( worst service and who can eat a steak swimming in butter) , Chan's , Octogon and Morton's. I've been to the newer joints too, Best Ellen ( cote du beouf) and Shore Club ( they are doing good things there).
Micheal's on Simcoe was a great surprise. I had the dry aged bone-in rib steak which I could not finish and had to take home so I could truly enjoy the bone, a friend had the bone-in dry aged striplion which was even better then mine, another who loves steak said this was the only place he could recall that had colorado lamb and he could not pass the chance , it lived up to the hype. The rapini and mushrooms were great but the mash and truffled macaroni were a something to pass on. All in all this place has the best steak in the city in my opinion.(keep in mind i have not been to Jacob's yet) . don't let the modern feel of this place fool you , Micheals is legit plus the service was top notch!"}
{"text":"We had the winterlicious menu here on Friday the food was amazing! Our waitress checked in on us frequently, and ensured everything with our meal was perfect! I enjoyed the atmosphere and the music they had playing. As many others have noted the bathrooms are really neat. Only downfall to the experience at Michaels is I found the amount of veg you got with your steak wasn't a lot at all. Winterlicious made this restaurant affordable for us, but I'm not sure if I would return on normal service as drink and food prices are quite expensive here."}
{"text":"Terrific steaks, seafood and pasta, as well as wine selection!  We also had a very unique and tasty salad, made with Cale, dried cherries and pistachios, YUM.   Then desserts ... no words good enough to describe!  The service is very strong and the owner walks the floor, personally managing his high standards.  You can dine casually or enjoy a formal experience here ... the atmosphere is fantastic ... you might even see someone famous ... we will go back every time we're in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Went here last Thursday for Summerlicious and to celebrate my husband's birthday. We were a few minutes late for our reservation, but were seating promptly in a great booth.

When seated, our waiter took our drink orders and answered any questions about the menu. Another server brought us fresh bread with a trio platter of olives, carrot tappinade and oil with vinegar. The carrot tappinade was so good i could have eaten it all, but i knew i had to save room for my actual meal. 

To start, i had the Sauteed Calamari and my husband had the tomato & watermelon gazpacho. I wasnt a fan of the gazpacho, but the calamari dish was delicious and was a good sized portion with tons of calamari that was cooked perfectly. I would have been happy with that as my main course. 

For the the mains and dessert, we both had Sirloin Steak and the panna cotta. The main was a great portion and the steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare. The salsa verde it came with was a perfect match to the dish. The panna cotta was really good, though i didnt eat much of the caramel sauce it came with cause it was a bit too sweet for me. 

Great dinner out! I gave four stars because if it weren't for summerlicious, our dinner would have been very pricey. 

As a side note, the washrooms are really cool too."}
{"text":"This place has quickly become my favourite spot in the city. From the incredible ambience and decor, to the exquisite selection of alcohol and the best steak in the city. I have yet to try a dish on the menu that I don't love. Love the live music, DJ's, and the incredible bartenders. What makes this restaurant truly great is the level of service provided. The servers are beyond compare to any other place - knowledgable, gracious and accommodating. The owner is always there, he is always very welcoming and even bought us a round of drinks to thank us for coming in. I recommend this place for any occasion! There are walk in tables available, however I recommend making a reservation as it gets quite busy at dinner time. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"One of the best steaks that I've had in my whole life. It was epic and juicy, perfectly cooked. The sides were average good, but the foie-gras was the real deal, it was the actually liver and not the pâté which is usually what most restaurants serve. 
Service was very attentive, we had a waiter but many people stop by our table. They work as a team and flow effectively and friendly during our dinner. 
Cocktails were amazing! We ordered a sangria (outstanding), Old Fashioned and red wine for dinner. 
Dessert was not as good as I thought... Creme brûlée seemed smaller than what they show at their website and my husband ordered some gelato to cool him down, reason why this review isn't a 5-Star. The restaurant was extremely hot, so hot that I had to go outside twice to catch some air. We asked them to turn the AC on but they said that they were facing some difficulties... the heat was so bad that waiters were sweating/dripping wet. We couldn't finish our bottle of wine as we were rushing to get out of there. 
fix the Air conditioning Michael!"}
{"text":"My dining experience at Michael's on Simcoe was hands down one of the best restaurant experiences I have had.

I knew I wanted to eat out somewhere good for Winterlicious and a friend who had stayed once before in the Shangri-LA Hotel highly recommended this place to me. From the moment I walked into the intimate restaurant, I was immediately taken by the chic and sophisticated decor. We were also greeted by a very professional and friendly staff who took care of us from beginning to end. We really weren't sure about what we were in the mood to eat but our server had great suggestions for both food and wine.

Our first plate was an absolute winner. We selected Carmella fungi and it really set the tone for what was to come for the rest of the dinner. It was so rich and delicious, and I'm normally not a mushroom fan but this dish was prepared so expertly. We decided to share a few plates for our main course since we wanted a taste of everything; the gnocchi pasta, pork chop with homemade slaw, and steak with crispy polenta.

All three dishes came out together and I was impressed by how detailed our server was to describe then dish out our plates for us. I felt very taken care of. You could tell that the gnocchi was homemade and fresh because it was so pillowy and delicious in your mouth. The porkchop surprised me, there was something about it that was so mouthwatering; a great cut of meat and flavourful slaw to accompany it with. But the real hero of the dinner was the steak, which I knew was what they were known for, but wow, it was spectacular and so full-flavoured. Perfect medium rare cook on the steak, with a juicy pink centre and a great crust on the outside of the steak. Truly prepared by a pro.

Lastly, we had an assortment of desserts that came out with the dessert chef explaining each. The presentation was superior and it was so exciting to get such a variety of sweet flavours after our stellar dinner.

We drank a nice light Californian red wine that was complimentary to everything we had eaten all night. And we capped the night off with an impressive espresso martini, as suggested to us, and it was perfection. A delicious and light drink with that bitter espresso bite to end off a terrific meal.

This place completely exceeded my expectations and gave my partner and I a real memorable night. They absolutely know how to do fine dining right and deserve these 5 stars. I will be back for sure and I would without question recommend making a reservation here for a special night out."}
{"text":"Had a good business dinner here, I thought the food was excellent. That being said, prices are steep so bring the corporate card. I had the 10oz tenderloin with the optional add-on sauces which was excellent. Sides are a-la-carte- not unexpected in a place like this I guess, but in my mind too small for the price- we had rapini (good), mashed potatoes (OK), and grilled asparagus (good, but smallest portion). Service was friendly but a tad on the slow side. Would go again though."}
{"text":"I came here with 8 of my friends for my graduation dinner. The place itself is very beautiful and elegant. The interior is radiant and the hostess who welcomed us inside was very friendly.

And that is as good as it got..

I ordered the lobster gnochhi and for the most part all my friends ordered pasta dishes as well. We got a few sides of fries and onion rings as well. Our server was very slow to take our orders and we waited close to an hour for our food to come out. 

When the food finally came.. womp womp womp.. disappointed. My gnochhi was over cooked and everyone agreed that the overall taste of our dishes was very bland. Not what I expected.Our server came to our table MAYBE once during our entire dining time and was not efficient at all. The fries and onion rings were good but that is all I can say about the food. For the hefty price I paid, Michaels on Simcoe left us all disappointed."}
{"text":"This restaurant tries to put themselves out there as high class. Unfortunately, they fall a little short as I wasn't sold on mainly quality of food, price points, and service. 

Upon walking in the restaurant, the ambience feels very upscale, modern and romantic. There's an attractive fireplace that fills the room with excitement. Furthermore, the blue LED light puts a stylish vibe; great to impress a date. 

The server we had was patient as my boyfriend and I were deciding what to order. However, it seemed like we had two servers and they overlapped, not realizing they were repeating the same things... We were about to hear about the specials twice and confused who was our main server...it just seemed a little untraditional and created more confusion than inviting. 

We got a complementary plate of bread with butter, pesto spread, and some sort of salsa. The pesto was interesting. It had a pate texture with an interesting cheese savouriness. 

My boyfriend ordered a snow crab pasta which was quite tasty. I would give it a 4/5. But for the price and experience, I wanted it to be a 5/5.

As for my steak, firstly, the presentation was pathetic. There was a small 6oz piece on a giant plate. The whole anticipation just became disappointing. The gentleman who brought our food out scooped the side of garlic mashed potato we ordered into my sad giant plate with the small steak. The mashed potatoes were nothing special and quite bland. 

Dessert was alright. I had the affagato while my boyfriend ordered the chocolate truffle cake. Presentation was lovely, but I wasn't a fan of the flavour combinations of the truffle cake as it was mixed with cherries. My affagato was great with the vanilla ricotta cream, but after I finished that, it was difficult to dip my biscotti into the coffee to really enjoy the dessert. 

The servers were attentive and refilled our water often. They were dressed well and knowledgeable, but they just seemed to be lacking something to make this experience feel amazing. 

The bill was hefty and I just thought for experience I came for, I really should've only paid a third for what I came for."}
{"text":"I came here for a friends birthday, there was a group of 5 of us and upon arrival, everything seemed wonderful (reserved seating, gorgeous atmosphere, modern and classy), but as we all know, never judge a book by its cover. I am so disappointed in our experience here so I wanted to share it with everyone (incase you are contemplating on going here - don't). Firstly, we expected standard service, if not exceptional for the type of restaurant they are, but we received below standard service. The waiter was not attentive to us, took a long time to bring us condiments that were asked, and did not check on us once to see how the meal was going. He started off nice and for some reason, after our orders were placed, he did not care anymore. It took around 25mins (it was not even busy) for our meal to come out and the steak was undercooked for some - now, I'll tell you that the food was good, but it was not $75+ good. We all agreed that we had better steak and service at restaurants like the Keg and Joeys. Of course, we expected our steak to be cooked properly and to taste amazing - after all, it is known as one of the top steak places.  The $10 fries are a sad excuse to make money, it was the size of McDonalds medium fries and tasted like homemade fries with a load of salt thrown on top - it was not even crunchy. After our meal, another waiter came and cleared the table without checking if we were done eating (we were not). We had asked if there was any birthday cakes/specials and was told that they would check and let us know. We waited 20mins, no one came. Instead, our original waiter came and threw dessert menus on our table and left. Approximately 15 mins later, he came back and we asked for the bill. He came out with the machine, we paid, tipped a standard amount (which was undeserved) on a $450 bill and he rudely threw the credit card back in front of us, followed up the receipt, on to the table. He abruptly left, and that was the end of our experience. Not once did he say thank you, have a good night or goodbye (this is standard in almost every restaurant). We will never come back here because the service was so disrespectful."}
{"text":"This is by far the best steakhouse in Toronto, live music, incredible dishes and impeccable service! Raaj at the bar is phenomenal, she is highly attentive and quite polite :) Highly recommend this steakhouse! My girls and I are always treated like royalty and this is why we keep coming back. Had my birthday here and my best friend will be having hers here as well in a few months. Great date spot as well as the ambiance is super romantic and dim lit :)"}
{"text":"Nice and clean restaurant good service the menu not clear hard to understand the waiters keep asking if you want help with the menu , and it is pricy"}
{"text":"We do beef. When Michael's came upon a recommendation by the concierge while visiting Toronto we were happy to oblige.
The sommelier nailed it with a great selection, our server,Taylor, did not miss a trick; great appetizer selections to a wide knowledge of all the beef options and varieties.
We opted to select a few steaks for the table to compare and contrast- and had all the yummy sides that were desired. 
It was nice to meet the owner, Michael and receive an unexpected delicious treat from the chef.
The atmosphere is trendy,  very comfortable seating with the focal point in the dining room being the large fireplace that has the fire poppin' and live music in the bar.
Ladies- take a moment during your stay and visit the washroom. The Toto's are warm and ready!"}
{"text":"Slow horrible service - slowest service ever!!!! Food was great! Best shrimp cocktail I've ever had!!! 
Plan on a 4 hour dining experience !"}
{"text":"My first experience...great tasting steak...sides were bland and depressing. It is expensive so prepare yourself. Good manhattan, good rye whisky selection. Good wine - they didn't have the wine I ordered so brought over a nicer bottle and didn't charge extra. Service is solid. My second experience...again great tasting steak...sides were better this time. Don't know if the first time we went on a slow night and the second time we went with big time clients and that's what made the difference. It's probably a step or two above the Toronto chain The Keg, their cuts of steak are better. But when I plan drop a couple hundred on a dinner with my husband, I would like a little more elevated side dishes to accompany their pricey and tasty steaks. The bathrooms have those Japanese toilets that do everything from wash to dry...so it's a fun and exciting visit to the ladies room."}
{"text":"I went to Michael's on a Thursday night to celebrate my husbands birthday. The service was excellent, the food was good, the atmosphere was a bit futuristic with splashes of blue lights on the wall.

We had: 
BISTECCA ALLA TARTARA -  5/5 this is fabulous. Really unique flavours. 

12 oz fillet - 2/5 this was very disappointing. A beautiful cut of steak, under seasoned and under cooked. We ordered medium rare. The kitchen cut up our steak as we were sharing and served us a very rare piece of meat. I don't know how this got past the chef. It was nearly bloody it was so rare. For a steak house this is unforgivable IMO.

Sides: 
Brussel sprout slaw -  3/5
Sautéed mushrooms -3/5
Neither of these were anything special

Desert:
Sticky toffee pudding - 5/5 delicious. 

All in all I was disappointed by this meal. It was not offensively bad but IMO it was not worth its hefty price tag. Michael's needs to up its game."}
{"text":"Michels on Simcoe. The best steak place in all of Canada. Complete menu of beef, fish fresh made pasta. All beef is very high end from around the world. 
They have dry or wet aged beef in angus, wagyu, tajima in various cuts, cooked to perfection. 
VERY High end whiskies from around the world, USA, Japan and Ireland. Also cordials and after dinner drinks. 
The alcohol listing in all liquors and the Wine list is to die for. If you ask for a bourbon listing, you get an entire menu of nothing but bourbons, all liquor specific. Amazing place, quite pricy but worth any celebration."}
{"text":"I will always remember Michael's, not only for the food, but for the washrooms, and our server. 

The interior of Michael's is modern and stylish, enhancing the overall experience. The seating layout is well designed; none of the tables are too close.

I was blown away by this place from the beginning, with the presentation, cadence, and service provided by our waiter. I can't explain it, but this particular server had a way of speaking that made me feel like I was in the 1800's. It was not cheesy, but in fact, made me feel like the restaurant takes its service very seriously. From the intonation and vocabulary, to the way he folded our serviettes... no words. It is just something that you would have to experience for yourself, although, I think you'd have to get this particular server for the service I am describing. However, based on his attentiveness and professionalism, I expect all of the servers to exceed your expectations.

i always judge a restaurant by their washrooms. If a restaurant has beautiful and well cared for washrooms, I expect a lot from the establishment. If the restaurant cares so much about its washrooms, think about how much it will care about the food. The washrooms are unlike anything I have ever seen. The toilet has a remote, a heated seat, and other specialties. It was really something. 

The table came with a delicious warm basket of bread, and Tapenade, unlike anything I've had before. The fish I ordered was perfect, although my friend's steak wasn't medium like he ordered, but a little too rare (was still delicious, though).  We were off to see a movie for TIFF, and had to skip dessert.

I definitely plan on returning in the future to try other items on the menu, as well as the dessert."}
{"text":"Came here for a business meal and had an incredible meal. First impression upon walking in -- the atmosphere was sophisticated and inviting. The hostess took our jackets and showed us to our table immediately upon arrival. We were asked if we wanted sparkling or still water. 

The menu also had a huge variety of things to choose -- it was hard to just choose one thing to eat. I ended up getting a salad and the chicken. Both were delicious and the consensus around the table for the rib steak, steak and lobster pasta was equally as amazing. Everyone was pleased with what they had ordered. Oh, the truffle mac & cheese side is a must order. 

Another thing worth mentioning is the ladies washroom. The soap smelled divine and the toilets are heated!! There were so many buttons to play with -- think Japanese fancy toilet. ;) 

Overall, it was a great experience and a great place for dates, celebrations and business!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant had always been on my list but I never got the chance to go until just recently. 

Super super pricey. 6 small oysters for $23 bucks! Nuts! I had the lobster ravioli. It was ok. But wasn't good enough for a repeat visit. 

My guest seemed to like his tuna. 

Overall, it was an ok first and last experience at michaels."}
{"text":"Food was to a very high standard, with prices to match. Not sure whether I could describe Michaels as good value, but the dinner was thoroughly enjoyable. The service was very responsive; the steak outstanding."}
{"text":"I am not one to complain about a meal, but I ate at this establishment for the 1st time on June 5th with a business partner and client and although the service, drinks and appetizers were top notch, the steaks were less than satisfactory. I selected Michael's given it's rating as one of the top 3 steakhouses in the city. Myself and the client ordered the 16oz ribeye and at least 30% of both our steaks were pure fat and not fit for consumption. The client did not make any comments though I could tell he was not impressed, and neither was I, especially after paying $65 / steak. We spent close to $600 on the meal that night. I've eaten many ribeyes around the city and have never had this issue (Miorton's Harbour Sixty, etc.). If I was not with a client that evening, I would of definitely complained at the restaurant. Sorry, but this establishment is severely overpriced for the quality of food you are are provided. It will certainly not be getting my recommendation nor will I be returning with any of my business."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is fantastic.  The service, decor, ambience, staff, bathrooms, and food are all wonderful.  I went here for summerlicious but also ordered off the regular menu as well.

The steaks are cooked to perfection!  They have a variety of steaks varying im size and prices.  I had an 8oz wellington steak with mushrooms.  It was amazing.  The saying of \"you get what you pay for\" definitely applies when it comes to steak houses.  Make sure you bring your Platinum card as this is no run of the mill second hand steakhouse

They have quite a few selections of wines, steaks, and appetizers.  I highly reccomend this place if you are looking for a Premium steakhouse to celebrate a bday, anniversary, or seal that next deal with a big client.

You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I came to Michael's for the first time looking for an amazing steak and thats exactly what I got! The service is amazing, food is truly top notch and the wines are out of this world. The owner and management are one of a kind and are willing to go the extra mile to make the customer happy. Would give this establishment a 5 star out of 5 star because I could not find any flaw."}
{"text":"I went with a big group of ladies for dinner on Friday  and we had the most lovely evening from start to finish. The staff was so welcoming and attentive all the way through. The food was incredible. I had the squash agnolotti which was the best pasta dish I've had in a very long time. We also shared steak which was cooked exactly to my liking and full of flavour. 
I would recommend the place for both taste and ambiance. It was a perfect dining experience"}
{"text":"Do not go here!

Although we had made a reservation, we still had to wait 50 minutes to get a table. Once we got our table our group was split in two, which was absurd. Everyone at the table ordered steaks, and everyone's steak was over cooked, when we mentioned it to our server she rudely responded with \"how a steak works is...\" Thank you, we know how a steak works, we have been to much better places that know how to cook a steak. At the end they added 20% gratuity without telling us, so everyone ended up tipping even more, although the rude servers certainly didn't deserve it. 

Food was mediocre, staff were rude and useless, and the place is poorly managed. For a much better steak experience go to Barbarians, or even the Keg."}
{"text":"Very pleased with the dining experience . We had the brussel sprouts, cauliflower, fries, Cdn rib steak and strip loin. A couple bottles of wine.
Service was impeccable and the food was quite good. Not for the faint of pocketbook however..."}
{"text":"Such a cool spot. You almost feel transported when you walk into this place. It gives off this cool, yet comfortable vibe that I love. Add that to the incredible staff/service, impressive wine and whisky collection, and their truly delicious tasting menu...there's no going wrong here. I'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Came here for winterlicious 2016 dinner and I was blown away by the quality of food and service. I was surprised the restaurant wasn't any busier during winterlicious!

The server was more than happy to explain every dish, and despite it being an upscale restaurant, I didn't feel one bit intimidated at not understanding what a \"croccante\" is. 

I ordered the following dishes: 
- Sauteed calamari: 5/5 generous portions of tenderly sauteed calamari...
- NY striploin steak: 4/5 a little chewy but the beef taste was on par
- Semifreddo Croccante: 4/5 delicious caramel flavours all around

Definitely worth coming back again."}
{"text":"Horrible seating...at a small folding round table they probably setup only for today. I understand they may be busy due to Winterlicious and it's Vday but come on..even seating at McDonald's is better. Made a trip to the washroom and saw empty tables in their dining area (we were put to the bar area). What's worse, we were put at the very edge near the diagonal wall so people were walking back and forth bumping into our chairs and stuff. Food was very meh, nothing exciting at all. For $180 (before tip), we had 2 mains, 1 side, 1 drink and 1 dessert..........Jacob's is so much better, last time we were there we spent $250 (before tip) on 2 appetizers, 2 mains, 1 side, 1 drink, 1 dessert but was totally worth it because the food was AMAZING and we got a proper table to sit at. At the end of the day, I would say Michael's is mediocre at best for a high end steakhouse. I've been to many and from my experience only Jacob's is worth the premium for special occasions. I would still just go to Keg on a regular day if I'm craving steak (would be so broke if I'm eating at Jacob's regularly)."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and delicious food. Our server Kelly was awesome! Definitely recommend this place for those who want to unwind after work."}
{"text":"Michael's on Simcoe deserves no more than 2 stars. Had high hopes before the meal and left more than disappointed. The exact same thing that happened at Harbour 60 happened at Michael's on Simcoe. My steak was completely charred on the outside (I ordered rare) and was insanely salty! As if my filet was dropped into a box of salt! The only 2 things I enjoyed there were the sides we got which were delicious and the carpaccio was amazing. I would've much rather just ate the sides than even eat the steak for free."}
{"text":"I came here a while ago on a date and had the most amazing time. The steak was delicious, it just melted in my mouth. The server was extremely pleasant and informative, taking time to explain and teach us a few things! I had a great time here and would come back."}
{"text":"The best martini in town - Expresso martini (if you like B52 and coffee).  Love the atmosphere and music too."}
{"text":"How can someone give 1 star to this restaurant. This is the second time and the service are great with well manner. The food is amazing and the beer I'm having is excellent. Even the bread they make are beautiful. I will definitely come back again!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic atmosphere and terrific experience.  The steak was one of the best rib-eyes I have ever had, which is saying something... 

Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Was here for Winterlicious 2016.  We started off with the pumpkin soup and calamari - both were quite delicious.  It came as soon as the order was in - guess it was all made ready for winterlicious.

For the main we had the steak cooked medium rare.  It was very tender and absolutely delicious - so easy to bite into.

For dessert i had the Semifreddo Croccante with walnut crumble and dulce de Leche.  I still dont know what it was exactly but it was like a huge party in my mouth - amazing!"}
{"text":"This is a go-to for me. Amazing food and even better service. Everyone treats you like you are their first priority, and the food is the best in the city. Michael is warm and welcoming and if there is ever a place I want to go to for a special occasion, this is the place."}
{"text":"It's my first time here and I had never heard of this place before. Upon entrance I am immediately impressed by the ambience, decor and lighting. We were greeted by the hostess and our waiter answered any questions we had. 

To start off while we waited for out food to arrive we had fresh water, bread and olives to chose from at our table. They seemed to have spiced up the olives with some herbs which tasted great and the bread (omg!!) was awesome and was accompanied by vinaigrette to dip. For appetizers we got the grilled calamari with beans. Wasn't my favourite - kind of tasted like plain boiled pasta with nothing else on it - but I ate it anyways. For the main dish I had the chicken parmigiana and my boyfriend had the 6oz sirloin steak. Both were good but just keep in mind you get nothing else with your meat - no mashed potatoes, no pasta, no rice, nada. And for dessert I had ice cream which you really can't go wrong there and my boyfriend had fruits with crumble which he said tasted like oatmeal. Everything that was served to us was beautifully presented. To drink I had the cherry blaster cocktail which was amazing but eat those cherries with caution as I immediately got a head rush off of them lol (they are bourbon cherries, can't complain). My boyfriend had rum and coke which again you can't go wrong with there. 

Anyways our bill was almost $200 which is extremely expensive as the food wasn't the greatest I've ever had, kind of bland to be honest. It is a very pricey restaurant so don't expect to get anything cheap! This is definitely a restaurant you go to for special occasions, not an everyday kind of thing. 

I might go back in the future, maybe next time summerlicious comes back around but otherwise I don't see myself paying that much to dine in Toronto for small, expensive portions of food. I will say the service and attentiveness of the staff was amazing! Down to their well tailored uniforms, everything looked expensive and just really well put together. 

I would've rated 3 stars based on the food alone but gave 4 because of the amazing service and relaxing ambience. 

Note to people contemplating on dining here: if you want an amazing steak at cheaper prices, The Keg is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Michael's is 5 stars in all respects. It's an Italian steakhouse with an almost unbelievable steak menu. We didn't partake, choosing pasta entrees instead. The dining room is very attractive, service extraordinarily professional, and the food was outstanding. The wine list is excellent, with extreme diversity and fair prices. Overall, the restaurant couldn't be better."}
{"text":"A wonderful dining experience. The atmosphere is warm and inviting and the staff are all exceptionally friendly as well as knowledgable. The food was fantastic it was difficult to choose off of the menu because everything looked so good. I will definitely be going back as soon as I can."}
{"text":"This is my second time there.. Something is off about this place. Not sure if it's the tacky purple lights or the underground location. 

The appetizers were solid- oysters, tuna & carpaccio. 

I usually look forward to the sides a steakhouse offers beside the steaks. This is where MOS lacked big time. Mac and cheese wasn't good and the asparagus wasn't up to par.. The steak was ok nothing to rave about. 

My expectations always supersede the food here. 
Plus- an expensive bill for average food doesn't sit well with me either."}
{"text":"Great hefty cuts of meats (if you get a steak or pork chop) which would explain the price... Everything tasted great, even the foccaccia bread basket in the beginning was good.

Decor and service was fantastic, but I don't think I would return here. I would probably just go to The Keg for steak and potatoes."}
{"text":"Dropped by Micheals the other night with a friend after the Leafs game. We sat at the bar and ordered some light apps. Everything as usual was perfect. My friend is a serious scotch guy....Micheal personally treated us to an assortment of exceptional choices , walked us though the history and the flavour profiles , and was an absolute perfect host. I'm not sure there are many places that give this type of love and consideration to their customers. Micheal is on a level of his own! Thanks , best vide in the city."}
{"text":"*Disclaimer: Winterlicious review

First impression: fabulous ambiance, nice bar area, just a very cool restaurant overall.

Unfortunately the food, at best, didn't blow me away and, at worst, was just bad. Winterlicious is no excuse. Sure, it's only $45 for a 3-course meal but that doesn't mean the restaurant should skimp on quality....after all, we spent our fair share here: we ordered gin martinis at the bar before dinner (at $21 a pop) as well as a $100 bottle of wine. 

The crispy artichoke starter was okay. But the New York striploin steak, which I ordered medium rare, was so tough I could barely cut into it. I didn't enjoy the meat at all. After attempting to eat it for several bites I let the server know and he offered to bring something else but I declined. Instead he brought us complimentary digestifs. Yay?

On positive notes, my husband enjoyed his pork chop and the pre-dinner bread was beautifully soft. But next time I'm craving steak, I'll be going elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great steak...lots of options to choose from too. Not a big fan of the blue lighting set up, but I guess that's because they try to be a trendy steakhouse."}
{"text":"If I can give negative stars... i would.  Awful awful place. Poor service, horrible food and unsanitary. We spotted a cockroach crawling by the patron next to us...eeeek!!! Steer clear of this place. One of my worst dining experience in my life."}
{"text":"The service at this restaurant was great; I felt very welcomed and they were very accommodating with  our schedule by changing our reserved time for an earlier time. The food at this restaurant was alright, the steak was overcooked and charred too much on the outside. I don't know if I'll be coming back to this restaurant.  3.5/5"}
{"text":"Very very disappointed!! 
We are going a lot to fine restaurants and this was absolutely bad restaurant!!
Not mentioned the steaks are so expensive! And we waited an hour and half!!! To get our food !! 
Too bad Michael on simco- we will not come or recommend on this place ever again!!"}
{"text":"First things first, the atmosphere and the energy from the employees was impeccable. Customer service was amazing and the place itself was so beautiful!! Oysters were bomb, drinks and drink presentation was bomb, I got the  8oz 5 star Waygu steak for 95$ medium rare and boy was it yummy. Side of mushrooms and truffle Mac and cheese was the perfect pairing and last but not least the crepe brûlée was one of the best I've ever had! The owner also gave us 2 espresso martinis on the house!

I definitely recommend this restaurant to all my foodies who don't mind something a little more on the pricey side, definitely worth it"}
{"text":"Eat here!! We are in Toronto for the weekend from New York and decided to try this place. I highly recommend the kale salad, one of the best salads I've ever tasted and everyone at our table agreed! The pasta dishes are also very fresh and tasty. I don't eat steak but everyone else at the table did and said it was the best steak they've had. Oh and the dessert, wow... Order the s'more dessert it is so good!!"}
{"text":"Probably will never come here again. 
food took FOREVER to come. literally 90 minutes for a steak. steak tasted OK but for the price I rather go elsewhere. 

they give a gigantic plate with just one piece of sneak on it, no garnish or anything, looked pretty dinky."}
{"text":"Visited during winterlicious, food was decent but expected a bit more for the price. Mushroom soup was a bit sour, but the calamari was soft and delicious. The entrees were very good. The steelhead BC trout had a nice crispy skin. The sirloin steak tasted beautifully with the mushroom. Come dessert, the Apple crumble was so good until you past the first layer and end up eating just a bunch of apples which to me was very filling and dull. The top layer was filled with the delicious ice cream and crumble which I wished they layered this at the bottom as well so you get the best in every bite. The cannoli on the other hand was perfect. Delicious, crunchy and not too sweet."}
{"text":"This place really has little to fault on. Service was decent, decor and ambiance is great but for what your paying and what your getting is a bit of a gap. Don't get me wrong, the food was quite good as well but in terms of price paid was a bit under whelming. If your into steaks, may want to try Jacobs as well for very similar price point"}
{"text":"Lol... This is first place I went to for winterlicious where their winterlicious menu is worse than their actual menu. The service was good but then again it better be because it was super quiet for a Sunday night. Nothing tasted bad but it wasn't like \"OMG THEY NEED A 5 STAR REVIEW.\" I was starving when the food came so I ate everything and so did my friends but at the end of the meal we weren't really satisfied. Aspects of the food were really good but it didn't feel like it came together well. We were gonna order off the regular menu but we decided that \"it's winterlicious, they have to put their best stuff on here.\" Wrong. So very wrong"}
{"text":"Went here for Summerlicious and was thoroughly impressed! Everything that left the kitchen was done to perfection. The steak and pork dishes were fabulous. The desserts were delectable and portions were good.

Service was among the best I've seen and decor was modern but stylish. It's pricy, but that's to be expected. There is really nothing bad I can say about my experience here! Perfect all around."}
{"text":"Wow, where do I begin. First of all, the ambiance is amazing for a romantic and intimate night out. We were greeted by a gracious hostess and then Peter came by and identified himself as our server. He made a few recommendations that were beyond what we would have hoped for, engaged in pleasant conversation and was very knowledgeable about the food and the wines. 

Throughout our meal Christian and Kyle both came by the table to check on things to ensure we were having the best possible dining experience. We went to see a show, and just loved the vibe so much we returned to Michael's. The bartender Emily even got on the piano and sang and wow, the vocals on that girl were incredible! 

Overall it was beyond 5 star service and my wife and I absolutely can't wait to go back! Katia the manager was extremely personable and accommodating. Thank you to all of the staff for making it such a memorable night! 5 stars and perfection were not enough to describe the impeccable experience we had."}
{"text":"We attended Michael's for dinner during Winterlicious.  Now, I'm of the opinion that a restaurant should give of their best food and service during Winterlicious, as many new patrons will be attending during this time and impressive food and service may entice them back for more of the same at regular prices.  Apart from the New York steak, which my companion and I both had, our appetizers and desserts were extremely mediocre.  The steak was done to perfection and delicious.  The appetizers were over salted and could easily have been tossed together by anyone at home, and the desserts left much to be desired.  I had the ricotta cheesecake with fig compote, but didn't see any sign of the compote at all.  As for ambience, I would suggest Michael's as a place to bring a date - it's dark and swank.  Despite it's swankiness, there were patrons wearing everything from sweatshirts to suits.  Service was good at the bar and at our table.  There is a coat check and parking around the corner.  I can't say that I'd return to Michael's except during another food festival or for cocktails at the bar."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying this restaurant but unfortunately it was a total let down. If you're into overpaying for food and too much salt, then this is the restaurant for you. For the price range this restaurant is in, the service wasn't very professional, the servers were nice, but that was it. We also made the mistake and told them we didn't have any time constraints because food just took forever and there was only one other couple in the dining room. Also, we shared our entrees, and two servers came to our table with an entree each and started plating them in front of us, which was awkward and unnecessary; it could have been done in the kitchen. One server was literally flinging the spoon and trying to slosh the food off the spoon like a cafeteria lady about 8 inches away from me.

Seafood platter, in simplest terms, is not worth the money. You get 2 oysters, a lobster claw, a jumbo shrimp, 5 mussels, 5 slices of tuna sashimi, and less than a handful of king crab salad. It wasn't just the quantity that was disappointing but most importantly, the quality. The lobster and shrimp didn't have much flavour to it and felt like it was just defrosted.

N.S. scallops, nothing to write home about. I actually thought the texture was a bit weird and questioned whether they were imitation scallops but maybe they were undercooked. I can't say I'm a scallop expert.

Ontario ribeye, cooked to a decent rare and they sliced it for us as we were sharing, but it was WAY too salty. I had to ask the server for black pepper for our steaks (which is also rare), he then brought us a plate of salt too in case we needed more salt. I think this place just loves their salt.

Sea salt fries, too salty. They looked like they were stale fries because they were pale and hard to the touch, but they were a bit warm and softer in the middle. The fries were sad. There were lots and lots of itty bitty pieces.

Crisp Kombacher onion rings, too oily. 

Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant. Nothing stood out, especially not for the prices they're charging. There are better restaurants in Toronto with similar price points and exceptional service and food."}
{"text":"I travel a lot for work and go to mainly steakhouses. Michaels is by FAR and away most insultingly expensive restaurant I've ever been to. The steaks are decent but all so ridiculously expensive no way it's worth it. The interior design is far too futuristic modern attempt and just looks weird. For the same price or less you can go to Jacobs or harbour sixty."}
{"text":"Service was amazing! The servers were so polite and thoughtful, exactly what was to be expected for a higher end restaurant. Our glasses were never empty! The steaks were fantastically seasoned, and cooked perfectly down to the bone. 

We ordered the seafood platter for our appetizer and it was fantastic! It was fresh and was beautifully presented.

We ordered the Mac and Cheese and the French Onion Mashed Potatoes as our sides. To be honest I've had better, but it was ok. Very rich. 

We didn't order any wine, and our dinner came to over $400 for two people. It was very pricey, but a fun experience. I wouldn't do it all the time but I would definitely do it again."}
{"text":"This is the best steakhouse I've been to in Toronto so far (I haven't tried Jacob's yet though). The first thing I noticed about this restaurant was the blue lights/theme which reminded me of a cruise or something to do with the sea. It gave off a very adult/romantic vibe. I arrived here around 9:30pm on Thursday and the restaurant wasn't too packed. However, there was a group of people which were very rowdy and singing off-pitched the whole night (which was kind of annoying). The service was excellent, all the waiters were friendly yet professional, as expected. They were very knowledgeable with the menu and different types of wagyu, as well as the selection of knives and its make and weight. The bread they served as appetizer came with 3 different spreads, which one of them was some sort of pesto I believe and it was good. Shoutout to Steve for helping us set up the prettiest dessert platter ever and picking out a very delicious red wine!

Because I've tried quite a few different things here, I'll just list the price and rating per item:

Chappellet \"Mountain Cuvée\", Napa Valley, 2013 ($165) - Steve picked out this medium-bodied red wine for us. It had a rich aroma and smooth flavour of dark berries. It paired extremely well with our dinner - 5/5
Raspberry Mojito ($18.50) - can definitely taste the alcohol, which I like - 4/5
Raw Oysters - very fresh and silky - 5/5
Lobster Gnocchi ($39) - rich and creamy sauce, big chunks of perfectly cooked lobster, best gnocchi I've ever had - 5/5

Dry Aged Prime USDA/NE/Black Angus Bone-in Ribeye 24oz ($120) - Not sure how long it was dry aged for but could only taste a slight hint of it. Was a little tough/overcooked - 3/5
A5 Kobe Black Tajima, Hyogo, Japan Striploin 8oz ($420) - hands down my FAVOURITE piece of steak I've ever had in my entire life. It was absolutely delicious. It was so buttery it melts in my mouth - 5/5
A5 Kobe Black Tajima, Hyogo, Japan Tenderloin 6oz ($315) - extremely soft and tender - 5/5
A5 Black Tajima, Kagoshima, Japan Striploin 6oz ($148) - very flavourful - 5/5
A5 Black Tajima, Hokkaido, Japan Striploin 6oz ($148) - so smooth and buttery - 5/5

Sautéed Rapini with Garlic, Anchovy, and Chill ($14) - I usually like rapini but this was just okay.. much preferred the one at guu/kinka Izakaya - 2/5 
Truffle Mac & Cheese Gratin ($16) - truffle everything. I'm in love - 5/5 
Garlic Mashed Potato ($14) - had a crust, nothing special though - 3/5
Crisp Polenta Frites, Hone, Parmigiano, Wild Onion ($16) - ehhhhh, not my thing. I didn't finish mine - 1/5
Créme Brûlée ($14) - soooo good, it was a little runny though - 4/5
Pear Cheesecake ($14) - so friggen delicious - 5/5
Sticky Toffee Pudding ($14) - I don't really like this kind of dessert but the crunchy topping they had made it pretty good - 3/5
Chocolate Tart ($14) - I don't like chocolate but holyyyyyyyy this was so good. Especially the tangy passionfruit filling which cut right through the sweetness of the chocolate and everything else I ate that night - 4/5
Mixed Berries ($14) - what can I say, I love fruits - 5/5"}
{"text":"Great service at the bar, and in the restaurant.  Menu is fairly static, but the food is always good."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing experience and amazing food. My boyfriend was coming down to visit from LA and I placed a request for Kosher steak and the staff went above and beyond to accommodate!!! The food was absolutely amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Waste of money!!

Super slow service, rude servants and greasy food. We went there for my birthday and they really ruined the night. We spent $800 and we ended up waiting almost 2 hours for our steaks and 30+ minutes for our deserts. 

When the servant brought the cake with candle, he put it in the middle of table instead of putting it in front of me.

After I complained about the wait, he simply said it's too busy (while it wan't that busy, more than half of the tables were empty) and he didn't even bother  apologizing.

Will never ever go back..."}
{"text":"Fantastic service, the steak is absolutely amazing and the drink menu is phenomenal, this has to be Toronto's best steak and drink place, The ambiance and Decour is beautifully decorated, I would give this place 10 stars if I could and I could eat here every day as I just love the food and beyond that the service is uncomparable to any restaurants in Toronto, whether you are looking for casual or fine dining this place has it all and you don't feel out of place, it's not like a stuffy old fashion steakhouse, modern trendy and super great place to go on a date, on Fridays and Saturdays a DJ spins in the lounge, in the dining room your waiter will come to your table energetic happy and well-versed on the menu, fun facts if you feel like you may recognize the place it was also used as the set for the American psycho film during the Soho restaurant scene, if you have not made this a destination as a foodie here in Toronto or visiting then it's a must go dine

{"text":"Very nice ( but expensive prepare big $)
The place is very well decorated, service really nice and the bathrooms .... I won't spoil the surprise for you.
I'm not a steak kind of person so I went with clams and scallops and I loved them! I shared the dishes with my daughter in law and they went on and divided for us ( very nice detail)
The rest of my group had the steaks and they were pleased
Go ahead and try it. It is worth the big $$$$"}
{"text":"Despite all the controversial reviews on Yelp, I had the honour to experience Michael's and the 5 stars already says it all. Not many restaurants in Toronto hit that 5th star for me, but Michael's managed to satisfy every aspect of my dining experience here.

The place is upscale and professional. It's a place to bring a date, bring your parents, or close a business deal. It gives a serious but fun vibe at the same time. Our server was attentive and checked up with us frequently enough to make sure we had everything we needed, but not too often to the point we couldn't finish a conversation.

We started with some delicious bread, while trying to stop sipping on my delicious cocktail. Our appetizer arrived shortly, where I was shocked by the size of the shrimps! I know Michael's advertises as a seafood restaurant as well, but the freshness and tastes is comparable to one of the best seafood restaurants in Toronto. The steak we had was unbelievable. It had since made it very difficult for me to have steak elsewhere because Michael's just set the bar ridiculously high. Every bite melted in my mouth, and medium rare was not over cooked by a single bit. We ended our amazing dinner with some of the cutest, most adorable desserts ever.

I highly recommend trying their cocktails if you're not feeling wine. It has a fun twist to it, and goes surprisingly well with steak."}
{"text":"I received an invitation to attend the one year anniversary of Michael's on Simcoe last evening.  It's a cute spot and there was an enthusiastic crowd!

When we arrived, Gord and I ordered a glass of bubbly and that's what we drank for the rest of the night. I love bubbly!

Tyler Yarema and his Rhythm provided the entertainment.  They played jazz and swing and were really really good!

I'm fussy so didn't try the steak tartar, octopus or lobster.  I liked the chicken sliders and meatball sandwiches and had more than a few!  Gord tried everything and liked the chicken sliders the best.

I've got to tell you about the bathroom ... it was the coolest I've every been in!  When I walked in the stall, the toilet seat automatically lifted.  What I noticed right away was that the toilet seat was heated ... HEATED!!!   This box was next to me when I was sitting.  Needless to say, I tried everything ... yes, my front and rear were washed and dried!

It was a fun night and I was impressed with Michael's on Simcoe.  The food was delicious and the service was good.

You should check it out if you are downtown!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is great!  I have been to this place twice during Winter and Summerlicious just because normally they are not affordable.  They are a great Steakhouse.  Their steaks reminds me of what I am use to from Alberta.  Meaning they probably do get their meats from Alberta.  Nothing is better than a good Alberta steak.  They do take care of their presentation and quality.  Their complimentary bread is also fantastic.  Definitely a place that is worth checking out if you are looking for a nice restaurant."}

{"text":"My friends and I were celebrating a bachelorette party. So, we decided to have a nice dinner before a night out on the town. We all placed our orders.  It took at least an hour and fifteen minutes to receive our food. Several of the waitress would walk by and say our food would come out in the next few minutes but that wasn't true. We'd noticed that other tables were receiving their food when we sat down first. The restaurant was not busy. Finally, our food came out. I ordered fish with a side of truffle mac and cheese. The fish was not seasoned and it was dry. The mac and cheese was not good. My other friends were displeased with their main dishes and sides. 
The manager attempted to make up for it by bringing us shots and calling an Uber. However, there was not urgency to get our food out nor was the service good. The  ambience and the live music was nice but that's it. I would not return here for my next visit in Toronto."}
{"text":"Michael's on Simcoe is one incredible place to celebrate any occasion.  As a designer I really appreciate their incredible interior, that matches their atmosphere and amazing services. I have celebrated my birthday at Micheal's with my closest friends and I must say all the staff treated us like royalties. The food looked like a piece of art, that tasted like festival in your mouth and left you craving for more, while melting in your mouth.   The over whole ambiance of the restaurant was just incredible! Michael's on Simcoe always chooses the best live musicians to entertain you throughout the night and keep your heart yearning for more. Luxury class all the way! The owner really designed one of the kind places that activates & pleases all of your senses. My friends and I loved everything about this restaurant and would recommend anyone to spend their special evening at Michael's on Simcoe."}
{"text":"This place is so pretty but honestly I wouldn't come back

Pros
Beautiful decor
Nice staff
Nice bad with live singer

Cons
Not a romantic ambiance as there was drunken tables screaming and laughing 

They seated us in an awkward round booth and we are obviously a couple..it was weird to sit on a couch and eat at the table that was right next to waiter area

Drinks overpriced. A martini was 21 dollars so we were expecting a great one. But it was watery and not how we ordered it (dirty)

Food-steak was not how we ordered it. I know maybe they thought medium is not appropriate for the cut we got but then just tell us at the table? The steak was med rare to the point where my bf was like..this is very rare. And he likes it usually on med rare side. But the steak was melt in your mouth

Mashed potatoes-a must order
Truffle mac and cheese-nothing special
Dessert-creme brulee-amazing

Bill came to almost 400-i wouldn't say it's worth it. I feel like I should have gone to Jacobs if I was going to spend this amount and perhaps I would have had better experience :("}
{"text":"Ventured downtown to celebrate a close friend's engagement. There were 13 of us, but somehow the hostess had confirmed 11. When we explained that there might in fact be 13 of us, she had quickly snarled back telling us the table wouldn't fit 13. Wasn't accommodating whatsoever, but the servers were extremely helpful, adding chairs and making room for us. We were situated at an extremely tight, long table and on a busy Saturday night during TIFF the restaurant was crowded.

The restaurant was extremely overheated, and we were reassured the AC was on. We had to make sure we weren't moving an inch, or we'd produce more heat.

Food took about 45+ minutes to get out. One guest ordered a salad to start, I'm assuming there was a miscommunication to have her salad come out before the rest of us anxiously waited for our steaks.

At $40+ a pop for a steak alone, we had higher hopes. My boyfriend and I opted to share the brussel sprouts and mac & cheese side dishes. Both were unmemorable. Everyone's steak appeared to be oversalted, some had to be taken back.

The women's washrooms deserve 1 star on their own. Japanese inspired toilets that are warm, and have a bunch of crazy settings to play with. Was quite amusing to a lackluster dinner."}
{"text":"Amazing steakhouse with friendly and professional staff, highly recommend for top of the line steaks"}
{"text":"Amazing customer service from Alex our waiter and one of the manager tonight. Our Amex card kept declining my payment and we went through 3 different Amex representatives to resolve the issue. Both Alex and the manager was super patient and went above and beyond to assist with the situation. 

We ordered the 16oz PEI ribeye shared with my husband, with a side order of sautéed mixed mushrooms with herb and sea salt fries. The ribeye was cooked perfectly, tender and well seasoned. The sides were just as tasty. 

I highly recommend this place for the great service and food!"}
{"text":"We went there for Winterlicious 2017, and I got to say it wasn't worth $45. I would say $38 max. The service was poor, u can tell they don't like to welcome people who are here for Winterlicious. The table beside us got 'better' service because they ordered from their regular menu. The food was so-so but the presentation was ok. Took forever to get our bill and they never came to check up on us after they served us. Fancy restaurant eh? At first it's understandable if the restaurant was busy and packed. But the restaurant was not busy at all, 50% of the table was empty. Now I know why it isn't packed at all."}
{"text":"Where to begin...

We reserved for four but one of our friends decided last second he could come as well so we ended with 5. They accommodated us by seating us at the lounge. This was our fault, so I didn't hold it against them; I wanted to let the steak do the talking, even though I had a seat with no back support.

The service was decent, but the restaurant is very pretentious and our server was a little fake. She was nice, but obviously just wanted a tip.

If you're looking for the best steak you've ever had, DO NOT come here. Given the price for steak I expected top quality and flavour. Instead I received a mediocre steak that wasn't cooked to my asking and lacked salt and also... well... flavour! I paid the same or less at barbarians and in comparison the steak there was phenomenal. I recently started my mission to find the best steakhouses in Toronto; Michael's doesn't come close. The Keg even has more flavour.

I have never paid so much for such bad quality food. If you read this, do yourself a favour and spend the same amount at a real steakhouse. Sorry Michael's, I hate giving bad reviews but I like to stay honest."}
{"text":"Fantastic fine dining. Dropped by for lunch, had the salmon, and beet carpaccio. Both were delicious; the salmon was very tender, flaked smoothly, and was marinated with a light glaze, while the carpaccio led the way with flavor."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money here. The food was average,  the service horrendous, and the decor tacky. The servers and staff were all rude, and they over cooked the steaks. Terrible steak house."}
{"text":"This place is great. If you love steak, try the ribeye. Cooked to perfection. Our drinks were also delicious."}
{"text":"I love winterlicious because it let's me check out new restaurants. This year we checked out micheals on simcoe.  

 FYI. Go to the bathroom. Delightful. 

I hate the decor they are trying too hard to be cool and 'miami'.  Yeah. Douche bag Miami.  But its the food that counts right?

Food. I got the pasta, pork tenderloin, and apple crumble. I thought they were all delicious. I'd come back to eat!!

3 stars, would have been 4 or 4.5 except the waiter just brought food didn't ask if we needed anything ever and only refilled water during dessert.  I'm guessing so he could get a better tip? When ordering, I asked for no marscapone on the crumble, the waiter said it was stirred in. It wasn't sat right on top. I had to scrape it off. I'm lactose intolerant so I got to eat dessert. Yay but would have preferred to not scrape off all the crumble part.  When eating I wanted a glass of wine, never was I asked if I wanted something."}
