{"text":"This is the best Korean restaurant I have ever been in CU area. The kimchi pork with tofu is really good! The serving is also very good. Although it's a little bit overpriced, but the food is really good."}
{"text":"4.5 stars, but I'll give it a 5!  I was surprised to see a Korean restaurant pop up in place of Los Mariachis.  I had a great experience here - cool ambiance, a sizeable but not overwhelming menu, large portions, and excellent service.  Ambiance - The place has a dark interior with comfortable enough seating.  I enjoyed not having generic fluorescent lighting, and the fish tank added a lot.  Booths were available on the side walls, and there was a K-drama playing on the TV.  Menu - One interesting thing about the menu is that after the Korean name for the dish, the explanation was in English, which I've found to be a rarity.  Unfortunately, there's no phonetic romanization of the Korean name, so you'll have to figure out the dishes from the descriptions.  There's also soju available.  Service - My servers were very attentive, constantly refilling water, giving us more rice, and helping to explain some things from the menu and which dishes were which.  They seemed like they could make recommendations pretty effectively, if you're not familiar with Korean food.  Food - Again, the portions were pretty huge!  We ordered the jjamppong/champong (spicy seafood noodle soup) and the ojingo bokkum (spicy stir fried squid), and we had a hard time finishing the soup and finished half of the squid.  The noodles were good and very spicy - not overcooked, though I was hoping for more noodles - and the dish came with a whole prawn, mussels, and squid.  While I would have liked a larger quantity of seafood, I'd take quality over quantity.  The squid was hot and tasty, and had a large amount of scallions and onions.  I was especially happy that we had banchan (side dishes), about 6, and a steamed egg.  Price - Our dishes were pretty reasonable, about $9 each, but the price range varied a bit.  Obviously, the barbecue dishes are more expensive, but I was disappointed that the pancake appetizers were a bit pricier than I would have liked.  Still, we got a lot of seafood for our $9, and the banchan always make it worthwhile."}
{"text":"Finally,  I can have delicious Korean food near by my neighborhood.  Food is excellent and the owner is very friendly. This place used called Mashisoyo. I stopped going there because food was terrible.  But now under new ownership and new name...I recommend to everyone. Thank you Good Fella!  Yummmmm~~~~~"}
{"text":"Good food, good service, nice portions. Nice location. Get some Boba next door after.   Might dispute the MSG comment.  Think they snuck a little into the dishes based on my restroom run shortly after. :-)"}
{"text":"After frequenting many of the on-campus Korean restaurants, I decided to give 'Good Fella Bistro' a try. A couple of my non-Korean friends had given me their recommendation after trying the hot stone bowl rice dish (bbimbimbop).   As a Korean second gen with a mother who never stops cooking, I would say I've had my fair share of GOOD Korean food. But I've also had some poorly prepared dishes in local restaurants around the C-U and Chicago area... as well as even overseas at \"authentic\" Korean restaurants.   FOOD: Good Fella's was the worst Korean food and restaurant service I've ever had in my life. Don't be deceived by their 'mom and pop shop' and 'hole-in-the-wall' appearance. I took one look at my beef-tip soup and knew this was a low-quality restaurant. It was poorly prepared and I knew there were ingredients missing in this staple dish. On a scale of 1-10, the quality of the food was about a 4.   SERVICE: It took at least 10 minutes to get a menu, 20 minutes to get water, and our food was served in an untimely fashion. People who had arrived substantially later than us were served first and when we were brought our food, it was SANS rice. The rice was \"being made\". What kind of Korean restaurant is \"out of rice?\" Unbelievable.  Throughout the evening, we were hardly waited on. It was nearly impossible to get anything refilled. The food was served in an extremely sloppy manner.  I had to go up to the counter and bring my own water because the server had just completely forgotten it, along with our forks. T  VENUE: The place felt grimy. The door was propped open and it blew over the tall plant inside the restaurant. No one came to pick it up so I literally had to go and replace their plant. Ridiculous.   I have a lot more to say about that poor excuse for a restaurant.   Nobody should go there and think they're getting an ounce of what a Korean cuisine experience should be."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating real Korean food, so I didn't have many expectations.  Well, the food was delicious, and there was plenty of it!  I had a silk tofu seafood soup and kim bop (basically like a meat sushi roll).  My boyfriend ate this pork dish that they cook right in front of you on a portable hibachi.  There were a few condiments I didn't like, but mostly because I do not like things spicy.  Everything else was so good.  And the service there was nothing be friendly and polite.  I definitely recommend this place to anyone who either loves Korean food or wants to try it for the first time."}
{"text":"Loved the food!!! They have dishes that other Korean restaurants don't have like Korean deep fried chicken, Black Bean Noodles  or Kimpab. Definitely coming back ^^"}
{"text":"First time eat here- it is a lovely family style korean restaurant. We tried the Soon tofu and dosolbibimbop- and they taste delicious.Will definitely coming back soon."}
{"text":"When I lived in Champaign, I came here as often as I could. I used to get the ox bone soup all the time, which was heavenly velvet awesomeness, and they had fantastic barbecue. the Kimchi was always perfectly fermented (which there is an art to, my friend), and every side dish I tried there was fantastic. I never ate anything there that I didn't like.  On top of that there was a woman working there, I think one of the owners, who always took an interest in helping us have an authentic experience. As one of the few white patrons at any given time, it was nice to feel like we were welcome to partake of their culture, and she consistently gave us advice on ordering and how Koreans traditionally season or assemble whatever dish we were interested in.  What I wanted coming in was a mom and pop place that felt like a window into the food and culture of Korea, without being completely inaccessible to an outsider like myself, and that's exactly what I found.  That being said, I was sad that they took jajangmyun off the menu before I got a chance to try it. Then again, this is more of a meat place."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the service is always great. Also, the number is wrong. The number is actually 702-684-7263."}
{"text":"The owner is very kind.  The customer service is great, the food is good, and the place is nice and comfortable also. I plan to come back here more often. Today I had the tteok ramen. It was perfect. The noodles were cooked to perfection. I will be back."}
{"text":"Our go to place when craving for some dolsot bibimbap. The yukgaejang is also excellent. Don't let the name distract you from trying the place out."}
{"text":"Food is DELISH for Vegas the Korean chicken is amazing, but be sure to get it to-go because the customer service is horrible. And it's not because she was mean, but because she never comes by. I even had to ask her for silverware and when the rest of my party came, had to ask for them too. They don't fill up your  and you have to ask for everything, we had to actually flag her down for the check. My mom went up to pay the bill and the lady actually told my mom to wait because she was \"busy\" There were only 2 other tables occupied.  Basically this place is only good if you're there for the food. If customer service doesn't matter to you then this place is ideal.  That being said, I don't think I will ever come back. Good customer service is something I NEED with good food in order to consider coming back."}
{"text":"The food was ok I got the spicy seafood soup. The seafood wasn't what I was expecting I seen the pics people had post here and I got something different. One tiny shrimp,and a hella lot of clams. It wasn't spicy, I also got the spicy rice cakes, they were also ok. But the thing that I liked the most were the side dishes they were really good."}
{"text":"In addition to the owner/cook being a big bully, this place serves Korean food that's mediocre at its very best.  It HAS gotten a little better than when it first opened, but still, I've always left Good Fella feeling cheated.  I can't think of one good thing to say about this place."}
{"text":"The environment is pretty good for a Korean restaurant.  If you expect inside to be some fancy place then it's obvious they don't know the true Korean food.  As always hole in a wall has the best food.  I had Jjampong and the soup and very deep flavor one of the best in Vegas.   Owner is very friendly and food came out pretty fast.  Price was right in the middle and it's open late in Ft Apache area.  Not too many Asian restaurants are open late.   Jaeyuk bokkum was good too.  Will keep updated as I try all the dishes.   - Mr kimchi."}
{"text":"I dont really care for the main food but the side dishes and kimchi are real deal. Best kimchi in town for sure."}
{"text":"I lived in Korea for over two years. I have eaten at several Korean restaurants around town and haven't been that impressed. The kimchi here is great compared to others around town. The spicy pork lunch combo was amazing and I literally felt like I was back in Korea.   The rice cake (deokboki) was also pretty good. I know that's hard to mess up on, but it tasted just like the food stalls in Korea. Anyways, it was delicious.   The food took about 10 minutes from when we ordered it, but of course we had all the yummy Korean side dishes to snack on."}
{"text":"I've been sitting here for about 35 minutes now. We have ordered and there is only one other party here. They arrived after us and they received their food before us.   I am pretty irate its just taking way too long for our food to arrive. Too hungry can't even.. Think... Can't Yelp.... Too hungry."}
{"text":"Small place next to other food places but I love Korean food. Service is good. Cup is never empty. Food comes pretty hot and the wait is not long. Small place but the Kalbi is Komatosis Awesomeness. I wish i can add a video."}
{"text":"Their tteokbokki is amazing! Extra large pieces of perfectly cooked and chewy rice cake :] The kalbi is also super flavorful. They have some of the best banchan. You might get more bang for your buck at all the AYCE kbbq places in vegas, but the quality just isn't the same. The prices are reasonable here and their food is absolutely delicious! Oh, and they have excellent customer service. Win win!!!"}
{"text":"Food is definitely tasty.  Pricy and you just have to take on the attitude of the owner. She really makes our dinning experience very uncomfortable. We're not coming back. Sorry."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Owned by a married couple from Korea. The barbecue cooked at your table is amazing!"}
{"text":"They provide various small dishes before the meal . The stone bowl is not in a stone bowl and is a little cold, but it's good. Generally the dishes taste good and sweet."}
{"text":"Good Fella knows how to make Korean food! I haven't had such an authentic Korean food out in Vegas like this place makes! If you're looking for great food, this is the place!"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to giving this place another try since it's been under new management. Back when it was called Mashisoyo, I felt that the meat dishes were adequate but the soondubu tofu soups were extremely lacking in depth and flavor. And very stingy on the amount of meat in the soups.  So I was hoping for an improvement in the flavor of the tofu soups, but unfortunately, after giving them another two chances, I'm writing this place off entirely. Perhaps it's under new management, but maybe the cooks haven't changed.    I love soondubu. I've had a lot of it, and it's one of my favorite dishes ever. Mr.Tofu was my absolute favorite place to have it, but unfortunately they have changed owners and it's gone totally downhill.  But I can honestly say that Mashisoyo/Good Fella has the worst soondubu I've ever tried. Zero flavor to it. Just tastes like water soup with some chili flakes in it. Disappointing, since I was hoping for an improvement with the change in management.  I wish there was something redeeming about it, as the employees seem nice enough. And it's one of the very few Korean restaurants in the far Southwest area of town. But sadly, it's just not worth compromising on flavor just for convenience.  Oh well, maybe one day I'll give the rest of the menu a try. But one thing's for sure (at least for me)... don't bother wasting your money on their soondubu."}
{"text":"The people here are SO NICE! My mom and I had the champong and jajang myun...both good and inexpensive"}
{"text":"I'm korean-American and its tough finding traditional great tasting korean food. This place is the real deal and doesn't use MSG!"}
{"text":"Every Korean restaurant has their \"specialty\"- a dish or entree they are good at making or take pride making. That's the pork belly here. I think they have the best Sahm-guyp-sahl. Pricey for sure but no one beats their quality cuts. Proceed with caution because you have to spend money to get service. That's why I give them 3 stars. Even if you tip well, this place does not care. I don't know how to get the level of service I expect but it just doesn't happen. But yea, the pork belly, it rocks. You stop caring about the piss poor service once you cook the fatty thing on your table."}
{"text":"Had the tofu soup and bf had the bibimbap; both of us thought the food was sub-par. Not really any flavor to both dishes. Maybe there's no msg added but there's other flavor enhancers like salt, that can be used; just sayin'   Tofu soup: tasted like someone threw spicy sauce in hot water with tofu and little amounts of hard beef   Bibimbap: lacked any flavor as well..had to use a LOT of the red sauce to give it some life, unfortunately.   Juns or soyo is by far better, imo. The sides were delicious, however very skimped. A little overpriced for the quality of food in such a casual setting. Sorry good fellas, not a fan!   However, I do want to add in that the service was very hospitable (:"}
{"text":"They cook homemade-like food - delicious! People are friendly and the place is very clean. We'll come back again!"}
{"text":"I've tried this place twice, and they disappointed me both times. Their service is extremely slow, and the food is very bland.   First time, I ordered a spicy squid lunch special, which was supposed to be spicy, which it was not at all. There was very little squid, so its name should've been spicy veggies with a hint of squid.  Second time, ordered spicy rice cake and kimbap. Both very very bland and the kimbap was rolled and cut carelessly that the seaweed ripped and everything inside was falling out.  I gave this place a try twice, and failed me both times. I will never come back."}
{"text":"Under new management! what a great change from last owners, like night and day. Authentic Korean food! Great couple running this business. You need to try this place, order the Korean sweet and sour pork dish, and the soondubu"}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant the other day.  I had the Kimchee Tofu Soup, the broth was kinda bland probably because I ordered it mild, my husband had the Dolsot Bibimbap, he liked it and my son had the Bulgogi Kimbap, he tore into it like a Tazmanian Devil.  The banchan (side dishes) were good, especially the kimchee.  Good rule of thumb in korean restaurants, if the kimchee is good then the rest of the food will be delicious.  Our bill came to $35 including an iced tea, so all in all fairly inexpensive.  The service was excellent.  From the look of place, I'm guessing its a small mom & pop joint, which makes its all the more better.  Gotta support your locals!"}
{"text":"Yesterday, my friend and I witnessed the waitress turn away an African American Latinx  family claiming they were out of rice then promptly ordered more rice for an Asian couple and did not turn away the Asian couple that came in after that. I will not be back again!"}
{"text":"Good food and good service. Tried the spicy chicken and spicy pork. The side dishes are good too..  I have been there a lot of times and the place is expanding."}
{"text":"I absolutely love coming here!! There food is amazing. Owners are super sweet. Atmosphere is great family place!! Will keep coming here FOREVER."}
{"text":"Very good food, great service, cozy, relaxing.  And just know they have karaoke system installed, heihei, that will be good to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"They literally charge you for a bowl of rice! And the food is not that good, and they dont even have proper korean sauces for your meat!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this restaurant. First of all, their food is beyond amazing. Everything hits the spot and the food has so much flavor. Everything they cook is authentic... Even the kimchi! Second of all, their hospitality makes me feel at home. I always come here and they always invite me in with a warm welcoming. I had my birthday dinner here with 14+ people and they were beyond great towards us. They cooked the food great, gave us amazing customer service, and they took care of my crazy family and I. I recommend this place for everyone!"}
{"text":"Very courteous & timely service. Friendly prices. One of my favorite nearby restaurants. I'm a big fan of the soontofu, other dishes have been just as tasty. Pretty authentic in my limited experience  hope it helps!"}
{"text":"I have been here three times. The first time I tried bulgogi kimbap. The second time I tried tteok ramen. Today I tried the bibim-naegmyeon. They are all good and the price is reasonable. It is a nice little comfortable place, I will come back again."}
{"text":"This review may be biased because it had been three years since I have Korean food.  Regardless, Good Fella serves the best bibimbop I've ever had! I've eaten at places in Chicago that did not serve the bibimbop in a stone bowl, so I never knew that stone bowls kept the dish warm for longer and crisped the rice at the bottom of the bowl. This was, however, the most expensive bibimbop I've had ($12.99) but it's worth it in my opinion.  I also had a pork dish whose name I do not remember. It might have been M16 on the menu. It was also very good with lots of vegetables and was marinated in the red spicy sauce.  I do not give Good Fella four stars, however, because it was hard to capture the waiter's attention for more tea.  In addition, the ventilation in the restaurant is not good so you end up smelling like Korean food when you leave the restaurant.  A big plus to this restaurant is that it's the only Korean restaurant in Champaign that has not been subject to a health code violation."}
{"text":"Very good food. We had the spicy soft tofu and kalbi; both very tasty. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Saw the new business listing pop up for this spot. This used to be the old Mashisoyo restaurant. I wanted to see if the new owners would improve this restaurant, because at the end of the Mashisoyo run, the old owners decided to take a big crapola on that business. Suffice to say, I thought everything here was OK.  The new owners haven't deviated from the original concept of Mashi, with the exception of being able to grill meats right on your table, whereas it was previously only available cooked beforehand in the kitchen. I didn't get to try this, but in the future, who knows?  This time, I wanted to try their soondoobu soup. I remember that the previous restaurant had a really crappy one on my last visit there. Hopefully that would have changed with the new owners.  The banchan came first, and by the way it tasted, things were not going to look so great. The only side dish that I thought was remotely interesting was the radish kimchi. It had a nice crunch, the sauce was well prepared, and it wasn't bitter at all. The other side dishes were pretty forgettable. The waitress was kind enough to refill my side dishes frequently.  The soondoobu soup came out. First, I think it should have been must hotter, temperature wise. It was barely bubbling. When I cracked my egg in, a lot of the albumen did not cook all the way. About the flavor. I gotta say that it was improved over the last visit when it was Mashisoyo. The broth is better, but didn't really blow me over or anything.  Everything was alright, but I don't know if I would come back for the soondoobu. I'd like to come back and try some of their other entrées, cause I'm like that. Oh, and I think Ace of Base should have a reunion tour. End."}
{"text":"Very nice staff. The spicy rice cake dish is the best I have had in Vegas. The dumplings are hand made. I feel like this place is underrated. Very hidden but very well worth every penny I spent there. Will be back for more definitely."}
{"text":"My family and I tried Good Fella for the first time and it was fantastic! The restaurant is small and clean, offered a variety of Korean dishes including soups, bbq, and noodles.  We ordered the LA Galbi and the Dolsot Bibimbap. The LA Galbi was very tender. The Dolsot Bibimbap was very good, a good size bowl, and had the usual toppings (sprouts, spinach, zucchini, egg, beef). Banchan came with our meal (refills on those too!) - all were delish!  Service was friendly and attentive - overall a pleasant experience.  We ate really well and left with happy tummies.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I ordered the bibimbap and the rice roll. I like all of them. The service is ok but the food are delicious."}
{"text":"BEWARE: Took my family to this restaurant due to the good reviews.  Unfortunately,  we were disappointed.  First of all, the banchan (small dishes or side plates) were average.  And, on top of that, they gave you very little.  2nd, the main entrees were below average.  We ordered several stews and fried rice which were all very salty and just didn't taste right.  Third, the service was lackluster and unfriendly.   Finally,  they overcharged us for our meal.  We were there on Sunday for lunch and ordered off the lunch menu.  When I went to go pay the tab, the lady had jacked up all the prices.  When asked why it was higher, she said that there was no lunch pricing on Sundays.  I do NOT recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Delicious Korean Food - definitely a home away from home.  I would definitely recommend this place. It's great too since you don't have to venture in to the chinatown area."}
{"text":"Korean food is my passion, and being a recent transplant from Santa Barbara, coming here with all the different choices for Great Korean food was like walking out of the desert to into the tropics . Have been to several places around town, but I wanted to find something that was in my neighborhood for quick convenience.  We found Good Fella Korean Bistro and fell in love. The food is delicious and plentiful. The sides are very tasty and we love the Tteokbokki (we like to add raman to ours) for a little different touch. Many dishes and enough for everyone to find something they like. Great to have them close when I don't want to drive and enjoy a good meal."}
{"text":"Great family owned restaurant. Probably need 1-2 more server as this poor lady is doing everything by herself. The food is pretty good. I just wish they have a combo menu like the kalbi and tofu soup combo. Good food so we will back and try the other foods in the menu."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious! We had the japchae, Kal-bi, fried dumplings and bim bim bop. Everything was flavored perfectly and I am defiantly coming back again."}
{"text":"The food was so fresh and delicious usually. The cold noodle is the best in town. The menu is verity to choose. So it's good for a big group or a family.  The parking is very convenient. It's a perfect lunch or dinner after shopping at the Wal-Mart."}
{"text":"Super tasty and loved the dolsot bibimbap. Accidentally found it, so we stopped in and smelled really good. We ordered what everyone else was eating and it came out super fast. Service was great and will be back again. A real hidden gem."}
{"text":"Nice place, friendly people. I got my food to go and it took less than 20 minutes.  I got two meals from the lunch specials and I was expecting something smaller,  it was good quantity of good at a great price!  Love it."}
{"text":"Hidden gem; best off-Strip authentic Korean food in town. Friendly family-owned, fast service and delicious fare. Of particular note, excellent bulgogi and fresh, homemade dumplings. Delicious kimchi of course, as well as dolsotbibimbap, and really everything on the menu."}
{"text":"This is THE best Korean restaurant in town.  This is Korean food nirvana in Chambana!  I recommend the steaming kimchi pot or seafood stews with a side of egg casserole to offset the spices!"}
{"text":"Hands down best Korean food in C-U! Don't let the hole in the wall decoration and location steer you away!  If you have never had something before just ask about it. They will take the time to explain the dish to and make recommendations."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a place that had really good tteokboki....I normally hit up Soyo or Mammah Oh's... But both those places are hit or miss.... Sometimes great and sometimes not so good at all....  So what's a girl supposed to do...I guess keep on searching for Korean restaurants to pop up....Lol  So when Good Fella popped up on Yelp and I started to read the reviews...I was a little hesitant as the reviews were mixed... But the pictures of the food is what drew me... The pictures looked delicious which is always a huge plus.   When I walked in I realized that I had been to this location before when it was a soondubu restaurant and again when it was a Mexican taco joint...  But the cool thing with Good Fella is that they must've bought the other place next to them to give them a larger dining area. Very cool and more seating which is a plus for me. :)  I got greeted right away and say right away. Restaurant was totally empty but after I had ordered and was picking on the ban chans...a few more tables walked in. The ban chans were all great which is always a good start to any Korean restaurant... If they pay attention to the dishes that are given away for free and they rock... There is a greater chance that the actual dishes will be great. :)  I ordered the Kim chi jun which was crispy on the edge and flavor was just right served on sizzling plate. I don't think that there is another Korean restaurant that serves this in Vegas. Most places carry the seafood jun which I hate. Their Kim chi was delicious and the flavor carried through in their jun. It brought back happy childhood memories of eating this with my sisters. Definitely be back just for this! 5/5  I also got the tteokboki... And it was so delicious!!!!! The texture of the tteok was chewy yet soft and the flavor was really balanced. It was spicy with a hint of sweetness. It came with o-dang(fish cakes) and of course a hard boiled egg. This really was one of the best I've had in Vegas. This dish beat out the same dish at Soyo and Mammah Oh's.  (10/5)  I cannot wait to go back and try other dishes!!"}
{"text":"First experience and it was amazing!    The owner immediately greeted us and was super duper sweet!  I ordered the dolsot bibimbaap! And it was delicious!  The boyfriend ordered seafood ramen, which according to the boyfriend,  it was really good. I also ordered pan fried dumplings,  which was also amazing and a large portion. After placing our orders, the owner immediately brought out the banchan, which too was delicious!    The owner noticed my boyfriend looked a little bit lost when we came in,  but kept asking if everything was okay, if his ramen was spicy, if he wanted more water -- she was sweet and amazingly attentive.  According to my boyfriend, that was the best service he had  in a long while.    We are for sure coming back!"}
{"text":"Really good food, fast friendly service.  Food was nice and hot and a wide menu. We enjoyed our first visit there and will be back!"}
{"text":"Good all around Korean food. Will not be disappointed with any choice! Good service too which is pretty rare for Korean restaurants"}
{"text":"Although some of the other reviews say the contrary, I miss Mashisoyo. The service was slower and it took a while for the banchan to come out. They also do tabletop cooking but there's no fan system so you leave wreaking of Korean BBQ.  The chapchae was just ok. The kimchi pancake was good, but a little thick for my taste. They also don't ask how spicy you want your kimchi chige, so be careful!   The old owners always remembered us, so I definitely miss that. But I'll also miss their food as well."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time since they changed management. They expanded the restaurant and bought out the spot next door that used to be an ice cream place.   It has that mom and pop feel to me. The person who helped me (I'm assuming he's the owner) was really sweet and made sure I had everything I needed.   I ordered the seafood tofu soup with kalbi combo. I asked for medium spice and it had the perfect amount of kick to it. The soup totally hit the spot since it was pretty chilly outside. The soup comes with a raw egg that you crack into it and the heat is suppose to cook the egg. While my soup was boiling when it came out, it still wasn't hot enough to cook the egg so I asked the owner if he could re-heat the soup for me and he gladly did so. Some of kalbi was on the fatter side but it had that nice char taste that I like. I just wished it came with more kalbi pieces!   So would I recommend? Yes I would!"}
{"text":"This is the most complete Korean experience you can get in town. She used to have a better menu and her current menu looks terrible but her food is just as good. Yes, there is only one auntie in the restaurant serving and she is really nice and warm. I think she is the biggest reason why I keep coming here, other than her potato salad."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for a quick bite for lunch and I'm just going to say what a gem we found! The food was delicious! The prices were even better but the best thing about this whole experience was the customer service. The gentleman that took our order was wonderful and nice. When I told him I was half Korean and really wanted to express how much the food tasted like it was home cooked, he couldn't be any nicer. Wonderful assortments of banchan and delicious food !!!"}
{"text":"Our family happened on this restaurant, and it has become a favorite spot. It is unpretentious, and the food is great! We get take out a lot, but it's more fun to eat in. There are things like Bib Bim Bap in a hot stone bowl that you cant really get take out. And they serve an array of delicious little pickles when you eat in."}
{"text":"The food was generally good.  I love the many different side dishes!  The lady did not seem very friendly, but I would come back and recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for the past 6 months and each time I go i am never disappointed. The food reminds me of something my aunts back in Korea would make. Nothing is over seasoned and spicy level is just right.   I normally order the kalbi, rice cake and dumpling soup and a kimchi pancake.  They're friendly and attentive and I didn't have to wait for service or side dishes."}
{"text":"The food is simply great here. You should try their delicous Haemulpajun (Korean seafood pancake). It is crispy outside, soft and juicy inside, and is not oily. The Budaejigae and nakjibokum (baby octopus with vegetable) are also very good. This is a family owned restaurant and the owners are very friendly."}
{"text":"I love this place. I really do. As long as I've lived in Las Vegas this has been a Korean restaurant. The names change and the owners change, but oddly the quality of the food is consistently good and the staff (usually the owners) are warm and inviting.   The seafood pancake is a meal in itself, but I still need to order the seafood tofu soup. It's my favorite. The raw egg that cooks in the broth in front of me makes me a bit giddy. That's the greatest part of the meal by far."}
{"text":"This little hole in the wall restaurant has passed through many hands over the years. It has always been delicious and they have now expanded the dining area. I feel it's a little grubby, but it is clean and obviously a work in progress. The food is excellent and service is great as well! We love the kimchi and bulgogi! If you ask, they'll even pack you a to go container of kimchi!"}
{"text":"Great stop if I'm craving, I've had better but this place still hits the spot. Nice people, decent price, and good food."}
{"text":"I love it! The ramen tastes like heaven! You should get it and give them a 20 dollar tip!"}
{"text":"This place is on par with Jun's if you have ever been there. The thing that Jun's has that Good Fella doesn't is a fountain machine. Like a traditional Asian eatery, Good Fella's soda comes from the can to your table. We were sat at a wooden picnic table looking bench. I didn't mind; it was cute. The dining area is a small room that looks like it used to be a Mexican restaurant. If my memory serves me right, it did use to be one and Good Fella must have just expanded into the room. Six sides came out, they were all delicious and we scarfed them down. They asked us if we wanted anothe round of sides which I appreictaed becaide at certqain korean placed you ahve to ask them. We had an order of bulgogi and a kimchi flavor soon tofu. The bulgogi was good, and the tofu soup was boiling so I don't have much to complain about there. We had an order of kim bop which is my favorite thing at any Korean restaurant, and it was a larger roll than I expected. Bonus! I wasn't blown away, but I wasn't disappointed! I think if I had the choice I would actually come here over Jun's because it has a more hole-in-the-wall/small business feel which I find charming. In the end, though, it just comes down to who I am closer to at the time."}
{"text":"I've always been here for the food for like almost a year. On the menu, it shows 9.99 for seafood udon or ramen. And they always charged me right. Owner was nice to me. But today, they charged me with 11.89. She said because they were nice to me without charging one more dollar. First of all, there's nothing stated on the menu and they consistently charged me he same price in the past. And she also states that: oh, we added u more seafood so we are going to charge u one dollar.  Hello, I don't care about less seafood, I wish you should inform me. They just lost a customer who consistently supported their business."}
{"text":"Very happy I found this tofu house nearby. The tofu soup and kimchi is so yummy and fresh and I don't have drive all the way to Chinatown. The gentleman who kindly served me made sure I have more than enough kimchi! This is my new to go tofu house!"}
{"text":"I am sooooo happy we checked this place out! Being vegan and going to Korean restaurants can sometimes be a challenge... Asking them to use a water base or trying to find out if there are any animal products in certain items, etc.! I forgot to get our servers name but he was SUPER helpful and friendly when I was asking him if they could make items vegan and finding out if there was any fish sauce or anchovies or anything in the Kimchi (there is!). I also found out that the Mulnaengmyun and all of their broths have a vegetable base!! You know how long it's been since I've had mulnaengmyun!? I can't wait to go back and try it!  Today tho I was having a Ddukbokki craving and I also ordered veggie kimbap, no egg or imitation crab. The ddukbokki was more sweet than spicy and the veggie roll was really nice, it had the spinach greens, carrot and yellow radish in it.  I will definitely be back to try more items!"}
{"text":"Just moved to the neighborhood and found this gem! Family run business is a big plus in my book, so I was pleased to meet the owners and enjoy their incredible food and conversation. My Korean friends say this is the real deal with high quality dishes, well worth the higher prices."}
{"text":"My family was passing through CU area and  stopped here for a late lunch.  I should've listened to the reviews and my intuition, but I was blinded by the array of side dishes (which were fantastic).  The female host wasn't super helpful in answering questions as she was too busy watching tv and crocheting.  We ordered seafood pancake which was ok, Chicken wings which were over priced and bland, and beef bulgogi bowl which was decent.  We Only had tap water to drink.  All for about $42 including tax.  We paid via debit card and left a tip on the card as well.  I recall my husband saying $50 was too much for that meal!  Two days later, he noticed our bank statement listed the charges as $83!  So, our account was charged $33 more!!!  I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.  There are plenty other places that have better food for less money and don't rip you off on top of ripping you off! We have disputed the charges with our bank."}
{"text":"Excellent and tasty food. Forget going to k-town or China town for over priced Korean food. Find yourself eating scrumptious short ribs at Good Fella's! I came here on 10/15 at 8:30. No customers in the store. Just my family. We were a party of 8. The mom and pop joint catered to needs with five star service. What surprised me the most was the food.  I had kimchi pancakes for an appetizer..and it was better than my moms..  The jajamyeon I had, which is hard to find, and difficult to find good plates, was very good. Not a lot onions like some places.   I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Best suundubu in town! Finally found a Korean place in lv we like. Nice staff and management. :)"}
{"text":"Best place for side dishes in town! Food's good but what brings me back are the side dishes. I like the seafood bibimbap, spicy tofu soup, kimchi pancake, and seafood pancake. The place has always been a tad too cold though, making it uncomfortable to eat if I forget to bring a scarf or cardigan."}
{"text":"Delicious! We were helped quickly, friendly service, and it was absolutely scrumptious! I had the bulgogi and it was bomb. My partner had some hot soup but girl, that was way too spicy for me, but he loved it!"}
{"text":"Since this is the closest Korean place to us, we've been coming here. Also my in laws have been craving it so they send us back to get them something.  They have recently expanded so hopefully they'll get more business in."}
{"text":"It is very quite place , tradition Korean food and service are friendly . Love there Spicy Ramen noodle and the price is reasonable only $10 lunch special . Will come back !"}
{"text":"We have come here twice for lunch and both times got to enjoy one of the two little outdoor patios. Inside isnt quite as nice but if you can snag an outdoor table, it's perfect.  The woman who owns/manages the kitchen always has made us feel so at home and even remembered us when we came by a second time! She remembered my boyfriend's order too! She also told us how she makes some of the soups and it is so clear that she is really passionate about sharing her Korean recipes with others. Food has been absolutely delicious and we plan to come back many more times."}
{"text":"Honestly very unreasonably priced for both quality and quantity of food. The service was horrible; I don't know what was up with the lady but she gave such an attitude which made me not want to come back at all. I don't think I will ever return again."}
{"text":"Unusual name. Served 5 Korean appetizers that come with order. When one was empty it was refilled. I found the price a bit steep but the food was good. Their spare ribs were very meaty and thicker than usual. I wish there was salad since the appetizers were a bit too spicy for me."}
{"text":"Best kimchi and Korean pancake in town. This is our go to place every time we crave for seafood casserole. A+++"}
{"text":"Food was very good. Went with some family and we all shared, it was all good. Lots of sides before the food. I will definitely be back to try more food!"}
{"text":"Very nice clean cute Korean restaurant in S.W. neighborhood. Good for easy healthy Eaters and family! Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"This place was very disappointing when I came to done in. There was nobody when I did come in and nobody even after we left. It's owned by a small Korean family and everyone who works there don't have the best English to communicate with. I ordered tofu soup with beef. I could've sworn the menu said the egg was on the side but it came out in the soup. Unlike most orders for tofu soup, this place didn't ask for how spicy I wanted the soup. It came out looking red and spicy looking but it wasn't at all! Even my friend who ordered the kimchi tofu soup said it wasn't even spicy either. The side dishes were okay but not the best. They barley came to check up on us after we got our food."}
{"text":"This place is very cute! It felt like a traditional Korean restaurant which was nice. I had the bibimbap and it was really tasty. My fiancé had the bulgogi and it was just as good as well. Nice to have a Korean restaurant closer than Chinatown."}
{"text":"Very good Korean food. The kimchi pancake is amazing! Beef Bulgogi is succulent. The side dishes are great. Loved the Korean tea. Friendly and attentive service."}
{"text":"my go to food place! I love their dolsot and bibimbap. Price is a bit higher but their food taste great."}
{"text":"I came here to dine in but as soon I walked  up to the restaurant, I noticed a man propped up against the door (so the entrance door was wide open) and smoking! I walked in and he welcomed me (I'm assuming he was the owner or worked there) and I immediately walked out. The restaurant smelled like smoke!   First impressions are everything."}
{"text":"Service 5/5 Food 4/5  bibimbap was yummy. the spicy baby octopus with veggies was yummy. i'll definitely be back again.  the place was busy for only one waitress, but she was still so nice!"}
{"text":"Best Korean restaurant closest to summerlin. I mainly order the tofu soup with either beef, pork, or seafood. If you have nasty hangover this is the place to cure it. Kalbi is also a good bet and good to share. The owners are always here and happy to serve you. They are closed every Wednesday and that's prob the only downside."}
{"text":"Found an awesome place to eat home korean cooked food...  Just the way my mom makes it...  I am so glad I found this place... A little far from where I live but worth the drive...."}
{"text":"Did this for takeout the other day and did the Spicy Pork. I love Korean food and eat it quite regularly as my girlfriend is Korean and all of her family is from Korea. But the quality of their meet and banchan is much better than some of the AYCE places out here and I definitely recommend for lunch or any other quick meals."}
{"text":"For a small place in Las Vegas, I was surprised at how good this place was. Honestly this review is long overdue but this place has some great Korean food. I got the bulgogi kimbap and it was fairly priced with lots of bulgogi in the roll. I don't recall the other things I've tried from this place but all I remember is that if you're in the area and you're looking for decent Korean food, definitely swing by here and try anything on the menu, you won't be disappointed. There's ample parking in this plaza, and I think it's owned by a Korean family.  TL;DR Really amazing Korean food is served here. I'm sure if you tried other menu items you'd probably wanna come here everyday. I wish I remembered what else I tried :( I just know that I grew up eating Korean food and I really enjoyed everything I've tried here. Give it a shot when you're in Vegas."}
{"text":"Very good selection of traditional Korean food.  Attentive and friendly service every time I eat here.  Food is delicious."}
{"text":"Went here today and ordered the galbi, fried mandu, and gimbap. The restaurant was clean, food was great, and the service was fantastic. Will recommend to friends, and will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Delicious bibimbap and kimchi pancake. The service was great and the atmosphere inside was nice. The owners were very friendly and welcoming. Will definitely be coming back here, we enjoyed the whole experience."}
{"text":"Had family dinner here with my wife and two girls. We ordered kalbi, Kimchi soup, japchae, and kimbap. All the items were made fresh and tasted amazing. Would highly recommend this restaurant if you need a Korean fix."}
{"text":"Service was bad but food wasn't great, one of the dishes was burnt and the portions were small"}
{"text":"The best Korean restaurant in Champaign-Urbana, I would say.   I went there for the first time in summer, and hoped that I could find this place much earlier. I have been there around 10 times, and I did not have the experience of bad service mentioned in one of 1-star comments -- \"at least 10 minutes to get the menu, 20 minutes to get the water\". Every time I go there, I get a menu as soon as I sit down, and the water comes in a minute. Also, the madam there is very kind.  After your orders are taken, you will be served around 10 dishes of really delicious appetizers(which are free). Sometimes I will ask for one more dish of my favorite appetizer(also FREE).  If you don't know how to order for the first time, look at the photos on the wall. Those dishes taste really good.  Have a nice meal :)"}
{"text":"I've been a frequent customer here even prior to the change in management. Really liked everything I've ordered here. The tofu soups mainly or their noodle dishes.  This is a small place and not really known too widely. My step dad is Korean and he said that this place had the best black bean noodle (I can't actually spell it), not exactly like his mom's but closer than going to LA. So I gave it a try and now every time I'm here I order that.   This place is conveniently located near my parents house so whenever I crave for noodles, I come here. It seems like there is only one server every time I've been here and its the same woman. She definitely works hard there and makes sure we got our bonchon and water is kept filled."}
{"text":"Good place for authentic Korean food. Not down the Chinatown corridor but nearby and readily accessible with ample parking on Fort Apache within the small mall area. First, the food - Black Noodles and Spicy Chili Mint were right on target with no surprises. Second, the service was positive, courteous and timely throughout dinner. Next, the accommodations were normal. Normal is good. And the value, or price paid for the food, was good.  We recommend it. We look forward to trying some additional dishes in the future."}
{"text":"Galbi is not worth it. No char, half cooked, lacking in flavor.  The dukbokki was one of the worst I have ever had.  It lacked in spice and looked like it had TONS of food coloring.  Texture of the rice cakes was awful and I'm not sure how you even mess that up!  I was hoping the ban chan would be a saving grace, but this is what I got.... I didn't know pasta salad was a staple in Korea....  *have to scroll to the end of the pictures to see.  It was fake crab and pasta drowned in mayo."}
{"text":"The best Korean food on campus in my opinion. I've been to b-one, woori-jib, yori-q, and few others. The only bad part about this restaurant is that you have to drive there. But the food compensates it"}
{"text":"Does anybody know where the owners went? The food is not the same. This was our favorite Korean restaurant but not anymore. Food is nowhere comparable to what it used to be. I can't find Korean food anywhere that was good as Goodfellas...So disappointing"}
{"text":"Great food and service! Our favorite place to eat Korean food in Summerlin area. 89147 Owners are friendly."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service. The new owners really changed the place up. I had the Sunduboo Chige and my father had the Dolsot Bibimbap. Everything tasted fantastic, the side dishes were good, and they even serve Kloud beer which is delicous. I will definitely dine again."}
{"text":"New owners are awesome and food tastes way better! I'm Korean and I know just by tasting the kimchi! It's my first time here and I tried the fried dumpling, jap chae, tofu soup, and bulgogi all by myself...all by myself and it tasted very close to home! Must come!"}
{"text":"Forget the old reviews! Sitting here now enjoying the LA Galbi...the server is quite attentive, without hovering. The Gabi is tender with the right amount of fat, no gaminess like others I have tried. Found our new spot!"}
{"text":"Me?I like to order, miss.  Waitress: You talking to me?  Me:  Yes, I like to order the Jiajiangmyong Please.  Waitress: You talking to me?  Me:  Yes, I like the JJM please.  Waitress: You talking to me?  Waitress:  There ain't  no one else here so you must be talking to me!  Waitress?with a smirk, gives me the banshan): Am I a clown??? Do I amuse you?!!  Me:  no, I just want some JJM and Champing please."}
{"text":"I sat in the restaurant for over 30 minutes without any foods and the whole family was hungry. We ordered donkatsu, jajangmyun (bean paste noodle),and tangsuyuk (sweet and sour pork). Their donkatsu was okay but tangsuyuk was not crispy enough that it was supposed to. We asked to a server to try it and she admitted and apologized. They should hire more people to serve/cook. If you are hungry and expect fast serving foods, don't go there."}
{"text":"First of all, I could've gotten full from the free side dishes alone. There were little sausages, tofu skins, kimchi, potato salad (my personal favorite one), potato cubes, little tofu squares, and probably more. The menu was extensive (no lunch menu on weekends), and had a variety of stone pots and hot pots. 4 stars though because the price was pretty expensive for the food (everything $12+) and we got the kimchi tofu hot pot and there were only 2 pieces of tofu, the rest being carbs. I mean, I wanted to eat hot pot (It came out to about $30 for two people) but I expected more vegetables and more tofu, but the majority of it was udon and rice cakes (which were delicious and I love them, but were just carb heavy and not very flavorful). Will need to come back again to try their other things! Service was wonderful!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is under new management. It has also been expanded with full service area with TVs and free karaoke.   The meal portions are larger than from the previous owner,  and the side dishes are included with your meal.  The service is very friendly and attentive.  And the food is cooked by AUTHENTIC Koreans.  What else is there to say?"}
{"text":"I've been here about 10times. It's a mom and pop Korean restaurant. Owners are very nice but hard to get good service when they are very busy. Food are great. That's all that matters to me."}
{"text":"I went to Good Fella for some cold buckwheat noodle (naeng-myun). One of my friends actually recommended this place, but I was not satisfied with their naeng-myun because it was too bland... Other items were okay, but I can easily find other Korean restaurants with better food.  The service was good. The staff was nice and friendly. They stopped by at our table multiple time to refill anything that we needed.  The interior is simple bad... The restaurant seems unfinished. No other special features.  I might try this place again later. Maybe it was just a bad day for Good Fella."}
{"text":"I loveeee this place! The owner whom is also the waitress is very sweet and friendly! Excellent service. We never have waited long for our order. Bibim dol sot is yummy and jajangmyun noodles are delish. It's hard to find good jajangmyun in Vegas so Im very happy that this restaurant exist! All the food and ban chans taste very authentic! Barley tea is really good and refreshing!!"}
{"text":"It's the real deal. Proper Korean food great service great atmosphere. Wonderful place to take a lot of friends and be social. Not too loud but not boring either."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times the food was excellent. As other reviews have indicated, however, the service leaves something to be desired. I wouldn't say that I've ever had bad service there, but I also wouldn't say that I've ever had good service there, either. But as long as the food quality remains high I'll keep going back."}
{"text":"Best Korean Food in Las Vegas is right here at Good Fella's!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. The food is delicious. I have ate here several times and each time the my meals are consistently awesome. The service is great and friendly too."}
{"text":"My cousin and I really love this place. It's very chill and also cheap. The food is bomb! Really recommend this place :)"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time on 07/14.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The food was excellent.  I'm not a Korean-food connoisseur by any means, but, I love the food.  My girl recommended it and says it's one of her favorite spots in town.    Cute little spot.  The staff is very friendly as it seems like a \"mom and pop\" shop, which I usually prefer to franchises and large chain restaurants.   I ordered the Dolsat Bibimbap (I think I spelled this right).  It was excellent.  My girl says this place has some of the best Bibimbap in town.  Don't let the restaurants simple exterior fool you.  My girl ordered some cold noodles.  I am unsure the name, but perhaps after looking at their menu online it's the Mul Naengmyeon?  They were fantastic, whichever it was.  The male server was shocked that my \"white girl\" girlfriend ordered such a Korean dish that he says he only has seen 3 times ordered by someone who isn't Korean.  My girl says this is the first place she's ever had this dish after visiting many Korean restaurants here in Vegas and SoCal and this dish is excellent here.  The wait staff was nice.  I think they seemed to like us.  It helped it was a slow Friday night so the male server made small talk with us.  My girl speaks a little Korean so her ordering in Korean (being a white girl) shocked the staff.. which is why the gave us complimentary fried dumplings (mandu?).  These were fantastic and extremely fresh.  Overall, great place.  Prices fair.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The server was so accommodating with splitting checks and our orders I was impressed!  We got plenty of banchan refills as well!  I got the veggie soondobu because I am vegetarian. I usually ask for water based since I know a lot of Korean restaurants use beef broth. I was so happy to find out that they have a vegetable broth specifically for vegetarians!  It was amazing! The appetizers and my tofu soup were delicious. They do pre-crack the egg so my egg was boiled past a point of my liking but oh well."}
{"text":"If you want to eat at a restaurant because it's got good designs and ambiance, this ain't the place for you. The place is plain with just chairs, tables and a tv. Now if you want a delicious quick grub, you won't regret this place. At Least I didn't. Dolsot bibimbap was to my liking and my wife is picky with food but she loved the beef bulgogi. Servings were generous too."}
{"text":"A solid 3 stars for this place. I wasn't in love with the soondoobu tofu. I felt that the portions were larger than after it changed owners the second time but the flavor was just not there. The owners were friendly and could understand English fairly well so that's always a bonus. My husband ordered some bibimbap. At first it looked like a small portion but it ended up being more than enough for him. He also thought the spicy sauce was not enough but you know that this sauce was spicy so it quickly became a lil too spicy.   Overall, prices are a little more expensive, but it was decent. It wouldn't be my first choice to get something to eat, but if I really wanted tofu I would check this place out. I definitely want to try other items on the menu such as the potato pancake. Can't stop this carb loving girl from eating her carbs!"}
{"text":"In love with this place!! I'm half Korean and recently moved here from Hawaii and I am so happy to have found a place like home. The owners are so sweet and the food is delicious. The best part is that they're open until late at night and the prices are very reasonable. So happy to have found a good Korean place right by my home here in vegas. I definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"The food portions were alright here. We ordered a jjajangmyun and a tofu soup. The tofu soup was actually really good tasting like home made. Jjajangmyun definitely lacked in some flavor and sauces, that it made the whole dish seem a little dry. The side dishes are very minimal in size, but I am pretty sure they will offer more if you run out. It is a mom n pop business, so there is not much service to expect, but definitely uses less MSG than other places, so worth giving it a try."}
{"text":"Both styles chicken were awesome. Under appetizers but portions are large. owners are super nice. I'll be back for sure"}
{"text":"Ordered here a few times, slightly more expensive than other Korean restaurants but no MSG so I personally think it's worth it. I always order takeout so I'm sure it tastes even better when completely fresh!!   -Bulgogi Kimbap is delish!! SOOO good!!! -Kimchee Pancake is thick and good, wish there was more kimchee though! -\"sweet and sour\" beef, decent but I do not recommend it for take out!! -duk bok gee with ramen! My fav so far!!  -kimchee jigea is very very good, I do order mine with no meat and extra tofu like mom used to make!!  -side dishes are better than most places  Owners are always there and so very sweet!! Open late so it's pretty convenient!!"}
{"text":"Nak ji bokum!!! So hard to find in Las Vegas and they serve it.    Wooohoooo and a half!    Nothing in the world like stir-fried octopus that is about three times hotter than anything has a right to be.  Good stuff.  Also, they helped my quasi-veggie GF pick out a Dol Sot Bi Bim Bop with tofu that she liked."}
{"text":"This place is super good the workers are super nice. There are plugs in there too which is good to charge your phone."}
{"text":"Feel like the price can be few dollars cheaper but serves pretty good Korean food.  Only problem I had is after I paid with my credit card, I wrote down my tip and the total. Few days later, checked my credit card money online, found they took more money. Guess they felt I under tiped them so they just took more money from my credit card WITHOUT my permission. (how legal is this?)  I'll probably go back to Good Fella, just probably bringing cash with me."}
{"text":"Amazing, wonderful, perfect...are just a few words I can use to describe this place.  The original owners 3 years ago, had a banging business but they sold it to some really AWFUL people. The place went downhill fast.  Now with the new owners the place is back on the upswing!!  The food is amazing, the prices are spot on and the service is excellent!  We got our new \"go to\" spot for perfect Korean food once again!!!"}
{"text":"This is an honest review. I eat Korean food two times a week and have been to many Korean restaurants in Las Vegas. This place is really not good. The owner needs to make some serious changes ASAP. We ordered two tofu soup and had not enough flavors. Bland bland bland. The side dishes were few and old, poor taste as well. I hope someone at the restaurant reads my review and sincerely make some improvements."}
{"text":"Best Korean food I've had since being stationed in Korea in 2014. Very authentic kimchi. Try the hot stone bowl bul go gi. The rice  that touched the hot stone gets nice and crunchy, just as it should be."}
{"text":"We stopped by here while house hunting.  Very good.  Some of the side dishes were home made style.  The bibimbop was good.  The kalbi tang was legit.  The Kim chi was crisp.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"OMGOSH.This is the BEST Korean food you can get in America, well I wouldn't be surprised. Everything is authentic, no MSG in any of the food. It just tastes perfect. The owner is especially friendly and welcoming. The kimchi is BOMB. It tastes how it's supposed to taste as well as everything else I've tried. This is my new favorite restaurant!"}
{"text":"Good service and good food. I had bibimbop and it tasted good and fresh. Kimshi was delish bcoz its not super spicy and on the sweetish side. Will come back"}
{"text":"So good. Glad there is new ownership. Food is not greasy or too salty! The owners are very friendly and we love this place."}
{"text":"Best potato salad I have ever had! My favorite in champaign! The price overall is not expensive, especially considering the over 10 small dishes."}
{"text":"Wonderful place to eat! Great friendly staff and the food was amazing!! Will definitely be a place I return to on our next visit to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Food was great! We ordered the spicy beef vegetable soup and pork bulgogi. It was sooooo good and the service was great! My only problem is that the store had no AC (or maybe it wasn't on.) Also, if you order a soda, they will just give you a can of it with a glass. Last thing, they are a bit pricey. But I think those do not outweigh the food and the service.  All in all 4 stars!!!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite Korean eatery in the neighborhood.  The previous owners were the nicest couple that treated us like family which we will miss.  The new menu is slightly different though the essential Korean dishes are still available which makes the transition to the new menu a breeze.   Good family owned business that warrants a tryout."}
{"text":"All of the food I have tried here is very good. I recommend the pork belly or the short ribs."}
{"text":"I went to go eat at Goodfellas for first time on Saturday . it was excellent food with really good service everything was great. The little side dishes they bring you are awesome.  I had a good time there and what else can I say I love Korean food. I don't find this kind of food often so im glad i went. I was visiting Las Vegas this past weekend and I saw the ad in a newspaper.  so I said why not go by and give it a shot I'm sure glad I did go it was well worth it."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Korean Restaurants. Ton of sides, delicious and fresh cut meats! Staff is friendly and attentive and never a wait for a table."}
{"text":"Came here when the old owners ran the restaurant and still come here with the new owners. They're the sweetest couple and are always friendly when I come in. I always order the kimchi w/ pork sundubu or the jjampong to go. Both are always delicious, flavorful, and very filling. Very glad this is close to my house for when I have cravings!"}
{"text":"So me & my friends came here cause Soyo was an hour wait, it was a saturday night -_-  The service is great! Definitely give them that.  We got our side dishes in a pretty good timely manner.  The upside is that.. it's the only place that serves jajamyon! so that's pretty cool. The only thing is, their sunubu (spell check haha) is pretty mediocre.  Great place though, but a little too expensive."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious Korean food! I had the short ribs and they were so good. My wife had one of their soups, can't remember the name but it was also delicious. They give you a good quantity of food as well. The service was good too. I really don't have any negatives for this restaurant. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I'm from out of state, so don't know how this compares to other local Korean restaurants. The food was ok. We were told they serve no alcoholic drinks--only hot tea, soft drinks, water, and no ice. The menu offers a wide variety with pictures. I love Korean food, so this hit the spot during my travels but all in all, it was just okay."}
{"text":"Excellent quality and service. We never had to ask for refills of the side dishes or water. Everything was tasty and though the setup inside is odd, it was clean. Most Korean places give you the stink eye when you ask for more side dish refills. They bring more before you even eat the last piece. The tofu soup was delicious. The stone pot bibimbap was tasty. The Kalbi a little fatty but it was still ok. The variety of the sides were really good"}
{"text":"Flavors are lacking.  I've tried this location about 6-7 times now over a few years and it is more homecooking than restaurant quality.  The service is minimal.  Most times I've dined alone and I am the only customer but the staff are either busy doing things in the back (so there is no wait staff or anyone at the order counter) or they're just hanging out chatting with each other.    For the price, quantity of food is fair.  However, I don't mind to pay up if it tastes better.  The seafood soon Su Bu (tofu soup in hot pot) has lots of tofu and few bits of meat and over frozen shrimp (mushy) and squid.   There have been more Korean restaurants that opened up on the Summerlin side of town.  I recommend venturing out and explore elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great Korean bistro restaurant on the west side of Las Vegas. Ate here for dinner and it was semi busy.  Server was nice and greeted us right away. Tables were clean and all the silverware was in place when we sat down. Menu was easy to read and there are a few pictures of what some of the dishes looked like.   I was craving some type of meat and they had beef bulgogi, which sounded attracting. For drinks I ordered house water and the server gave us a jug of water and a small metal cup to pour and drink from.  Food came out in a normal timely fashion manner. The beef bulgogi was fairly loaded on the plate with some onions on top. The beef was tender and had a lot of flavor. It also came with a side of rice. I also got a few appetizers that came with the meal. I am not really sure what the side dishes were but they were all favorable.   The setting was pretty dim inside and there was a television to watch. Overall experience was good and they had acceptable customer service.   Thank you"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. The owners are supremely nice and always have a smile on their faces. I enjoy the location being so close and convenient as well. I generally order sundubu, but have had nothing but positive experiences with all of the dishes including the complimentary side dishes."}
{"text":"Decent beef rice bowl with not so hot sauces and fried eggs. Side dishes are various and awesome!! Overall a good place to go."}
{"text":"This place used to be Mashisoyo. New owners, new menu- new guys really know what they are doing- menu is fantastic! Love that you can have your Korean BBQ cooked at your table- saw another table eating it and it looked sooooo good. The owners made it a point to let us know that they absolutely do not use MSG and that all their banchan including their kimchi is made in house. Can't wait to go back and try more things on the menu like the sullungtang and budhae jiggae. (Please excuse my Korean spelling- I'm only Korean by association and too much KDrama.) My BF and I had the sundubu tofu soup with kimchi and pork and it was way better than Tofu Hut and Mr. Tofu. I really hope these guys stick around for long as I desperately NEED a place like this close to my house. Could eat this stuff everyday."}
{"text":"Came here for the 3rd time it's good we order the same thing or something different atleast!  The people works here are nice .."}
{"text":"Here visiting Vegas, the food was good and there was a lot. I would say it's worth the price considering the amount! The female cook took her time and put in the love. It's a a slightly different taste then I'm use to. I think it's because it's of the cooks' particular style; everyone has their own twist on stuff. What I thought was cool is that the food stayed so hot. We ordered it for take out and it was still hot when we got to our place. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"We had the soon doo boo and kalbi combo. It was authentic, and it hit the spot. Banchan is standard but flavorful. Kimchi was good. Friendly service. Definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"Delicious!  The galbi is the best in town.  A recent expansion makes in-store dining easier and the takeout option is perfect for  exposing large groups to great Korean food."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a personal tragedy yesterday and we were looking to cheer each other up with some of her favorite comfort food - Korean.  We did our typical Yelp search as it serves as our only guide in a valley still new to us and found Goodfella.  Now I had my misgivings.  I'm from an Italian neighborhood in Chicago so, naturally, I was intrigued to make the connection.  My wife is observant about lots of things, but it comes to restaurants, she wants to see people of the same ethnic background going to the same cuisine (Italians at Italian bistros, Chinese at Chinese, etc.).  She noticed right off that plenty of Koreans were popping in and out of their establishment.  Another person we noticed was the ever present elder in the corner watching tv.  Now, in Chicago, I've noticed that elders in the restaurant are the silent overseers of the establishment - kind of like the gargoyles sitting atop French churches keeping an eye on the city.  It's comforting and reassuring.  Gino cooks and Yung, his wife, manages everything else.  It's a team that works and produces, hands down, the best Korean food we've found in the valley.  So much better that they're close to home and a bargain compared to our former staple of Ginseng BBQ2 on the strip.    Yung and Gino went out of their way to make us feel welcome.  We got the feeling like we were given the private chef's table in the kitchen like some of the old, authentic Italian restaurants back home are famous for.  Gino, a well travelled man of culture, shared with us his philosophy on Korean food.  Authenticity.  Gino has a distaste for fusion.  Why?  Because it dilutes the cultural heritage of a cuisine by trying to make it adapt to a Western palette.  He believes in cooking and doing one thing good and it's making authentic Korean food.    The result is delicious.  He pulled up a chair and regaled us with stories of his time lived in various places such as New York and Chicago - his culinary adventures there and the experiences he's had.  We could have talked all night - it was like we were being entertained by Andrew Zimmern or Samantha Brown.  Anyway, I'm gushing.  Since we ordered so much food, we had plenty of take home.  Gino made sure that we understood how to properly warm up our food so we could enjoy our japchae (the best I've ever had) again the next morning.    Go here.  Eat.  Have fun and sing a tune or two next door as they have a karaoke bar too!"}
{"text":"***YELP 100 CHALLENGE 36/100***  Don't get me wrong, the food isn't bad at all, but I wouldn't say it's the best either. What turned me off was the price point.  We went last Sunday, a little after they opened at 1. We were the first customers that day, when we walked in a younger lady was sitting by the kitchen just staring at us. It was kinda awkward for a minute since she didn't say anything, then a middle aged man walks up to welcome us and led us to a table of our choice. The place is tiny yet cozy, feels like home in a way.  Nothing in the menu really stood out for me, there wasn't really much to choose from. I'm not into Korean soups but I do like Korean BBQ and bibimbap. We decided on an order of Bulgogi, Korean spicy pork and Kimchi fried rice. Both the meat dishes were flavorful, of the two I like the spicy pork the best. It was sliced very thinly almost like bacon slices with just the right amount of heat which was perfect for me since I don't really like spicy food all that much. The Kimchi fried rice wasn't up to par at all, I can say in all honesty that what I make at home tastes way better than what was served. 4 out of the 6 banchan was good so no complaints there.  So for 2 dishes, Kimchi fried rice and 3 drinks, the total came out to $55 including a 20% tip, roughly $15 per meat dish which is kinda high in my opinion especially when there's plenty of competition around, for the same amount of food and quality for $3 less."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is bland and boring, the food is also bland and lacking character. We had the bulgogi and spicy pork belly, it was definitely not spicy and the vegetables made the proteins boring and basic. It seems like a mom and pop shop which i would much rather support but the food is definitely not worth it. I would much rather wait for 45+ minutes at tofu hut for a much tastier/cheaper meal."}
{"text":"Great food with good customer service! Their food is very tasty :) ill will definitely come back here.... Their portion is pretty big..."}
{"text":"Came here one night with my boyfriend to try the place out. We needed a quick dinner before our drive to California and this place popped up. We figured, why not. Let's give it a try.  This restaurant used to be Mashisoyo and it turns out that they bought the location next to them and expanded the restaurant a tiny bit. When we got our seats, there was only one person waiting for take out and another table that just arrived a little bit prior to us.   I decided on the bibim naengmyeon while my boyfriend went with the jajangmyeon. It took them a good 15ish minutes to bring out our banchan and another 20ish minutes to bring out our food. It took them a long time despite there being NO ONE eating at the restaurant aside from the other table. Especially for the dishes that we ordered, it shouldn't take that long. It's noodles and sauce!   The jajangmyeon was average. For my bibim naengmyeon, it was decent but they had way too much sauce. After a few bites, I just got really bored of the flavor and the yummyness of it died off.   So for the average food and the extremely long wait .. it certainly makes me not want to come back."}
{"text":"Been to this place a few times already and so far I have no disappointments to express.  If you prefer simple, nothing fancy and most of all affordable PLUS awesome Korean dishes, this is the place to be.  Excellent and Exceptional customer service and superb food.  Let's support and try this place its local... let's go!!!"}
{"text":"Oh. My. Goodness. The food is soooo yummy and people that work there are so nice! When I first came to CU I was so upset that I couldn't find a Korean restaurant that met my standards but then I discovered this little gem and I couldn't be happier. I have to admit, this isn't my all time favorite Korean restaurant but they are definitely the best in the CU area. They give so many side dishes which is always a huge plus in my book (the potato salad is my favorite!). If you haven't tried this restaurant yet, I definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Finally I tried this place yesterday night not much people and it is half self service place it's little expensive for 1 person but I think their serving is good for 2 ppls. I like this place tho!!ill definitely come back again"}
{"text":"Ordered the beef dolsot bimbimbap, there was a nice assortment of veggies and it came out sizzling.  I only wish there was a little more beef to the dish. The ban chan selection was good and the owner came to check on us a few times.  The place seems to have expanded since this was Mashisoyo.  The décor seems to need a little work, but this place worked for us since it was quiet and we have an infant =)  Oh and I noticed they have Korean fried chicken on the menu.  Will definitely need to try that at the next visit to determine if it is legit!"}
{"text":"I've been to Korea my whole childhood as a military brat and this restaurant is like being back in Korea. They have everything you could want! Highly recommend this place! Portions are huge and the owners are extremely kind!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been coming to this restaurant for Korean food since last year 2015. Since then it has became our favorite place to go when we crave for Korean food. For the portion you get, the price is just right. The lady is super nice, and the food hit the spot every time."}
{"text":"under new management.  got my veggie tofu soup to go after work.  I like it very spicy and it is very spicy.  the lady at the cashier was friendly & nice.  she gave me extra sides of kim chi when I requested that I only want that side dish to go.  now I have rice and kim chi lunch for tomorrow.  I hope they will have brown rice soon cause they only have white rice and noodles.  still a good place to eat tho.  I have find my new favor Korean place in Vegas."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for a while but recently the owners must have changed. The new owners seems to be nice people however the food is no longer as good as it used to be. Seemed to be on the blant side. Also the side dishes were fairly standard. Nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Stopped here for dinner with a friend. Got the spicy seafood and veggie soup while he got the bibimbap. It was very mediocre food and poor service. The broth itself was nicely spiced but the taste and smell were like frozen seafood that had been repeatedly boiled over. Mehhh... I'll pass."}
{"text":"This is the real deal!  Everything is homemade with the finest quality ingredients.  The Bulgogi melts in your mouth and has the perfect balance of flavors.  The Dolsot Bibimbop sizzles with fresh veggies, meat and egg.  The fried dumplings are perfection.  My boyfriend couldn't get enough of the homemade spicy hot sauce and says he will never have Sriracha again after this.  The owners were very friendly and the restaurant was clean.  Good Fella is the absolute best Korean restaurant we've been to so far in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I've lived here 6 years and have searched for a delicious AUTHENTIC Korean spot...finally!! One close to my house!  So many Korean restaurants are Americanized with their food and I'm always left disappointed.    Their kimchi is perfect.  I've tried a few dishes which were all amazing, but haven't found a spot that can make jja-jjang meun like my mom...and it's finally happened!  That passed the final test.   And this is home cookin made to order!!  If you want your food in 5 min and not made with love...go to Panda Express.  No fast food here!   If you're looking for delicious Korean food, great service, and a cozy spot....you've gotta come here.  Can't wait to bring my Korean mama here next week. Usually we end up cooking at the house because we can't find anywhere here to eat!  And after 6 years...we've tried most in the Vegas valley. We'll definitely be on a first name basis soon. :)))"}
{"text":"Service was decent, food was mediocre, pricing was expensive for the food portions and quality, loud K-Pop music television, limited seating (there's a treble a got away from the bathroom. In a nutshell we will not be going back, you can get better food for the price you'll pay here if not cheaper. The decision to eat here was regrettable."}
{"text":"The new management here is a million times better then who ran this establishment before. The food is delicious and good quality. My staff and I love coming here for lunch. I wish they had a location in Henderson so I can have it more often....Hee hee."}
{"text":"dont have anything bad to say about this place. loved the service and food. we will def be returning. yay!"}
{"text":"Took my sister here because we were craving some Korean food. We both had some Bibimbap. So GOOD. Honestly I don't mind the drive to get here. The atmosphere was nice and so was the Ajumma and staff. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious. The owner is very attentive always asking if I want refills on rice, the small vegetable dishes or soda. The lunch special is a great value too.  Since this restaurant been under new management the number of customers has picked up during lunch. Most of them being Korean which says a lot about the quality of the food.  The only negative is they're closed on Monday."}
{"text":"I've never been to it with the prior management but this new management is great. So they've reduced the menu quite a bit, to only include the more popular items. I like small menus. It means you don't have to take as long to decide what to eat. I decided to get the soondubu combo with the kalbi. The soondubu arrived boiling hot and it was yummy! It hit the spot! It wasn't as spicy as other places I've gone to but I'm sure they can spice it up to the spicy level that you want. The kalbi was also very delicious. It was tender and the marinade on it was just perfect. They also gave you a good serving.  The service was also on point. It's rare to find good service nowadays. The waiter was always there when we needed him and he was checking on us frequently, not an annoying frequently, but just right! He also grabbed us more sides since he noticed that we've finished all the fish cakes, without even asking for more. I appreciate observant servers because you don't have to ask for things. They just know already and it's great!  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant before it was taken over by new management. I have only been here twice and already I'm greeted by the same lady and she remembers my order and how I like it. It's great when the staff remembers little things like that. It's good, flavorful food that I usually would have to drive further to get. It's so fortunate that they are around the corner. The prices are about average for what you would find in any type of Korean restaurant, but you will be satisfied with the amount of food they bring to the table. Friendly, clean and family oriented restaurant."}
