{"text":"I'm a local to the area and a Store manager in the customer service industry therefore,  a I know good customer service of which this place has none. I was completely ignored and then when I tried to return the burnt orders that I received I wasn't even acknowledged. One of the servers just stared at me and never said a word. I then asked the gentleman if this was just how they prepared \"Chicken Fingers\" he's response was, \"You mean Chicken Tenders?\" Im thinking.. It's the same thing and no need for the attitude. Good thing their kitchen is exposed to the dinning area so that I could watch to see whether or not they would tamper with my food. Will not be eating here again. Boo on Barrel Burger. #ThumbsDown!"}
{"text":"Slow as all get out. 5 Guys can knock out hand crafted burgers in a fraction of the time. Burger was dried out and fries over done.  My family was finished with their lunch before my food was ready."}
{"text":"My burger was very good, fries were great.  A little pricey and very slow is why I am giving three stars.  Garbage cans outside were overflowing and needed to be changed.

The Kids meal for five bucks was a deal and my little guy liked his burger."}
{"text":"Just had my first Barrel Burger located in the Lake Norman Whole Foods in Huntersville. The Grillmaster made the best Shroom Burger I've ever had...and the fries included with the burger, all  for $5,  made it an even better experience. They also had my favorite beer, OMB Copper, on tap, along with 4 other brews. Will definitely return here!"}
{"text":"Doubled it's prices for more meat..
I don't need more meat..No more...sorry Whole foods."}
{"text":"Farewell Barrel Burgers. You more than doubled your prices (literally) overnight. What gives? I was able to get a burger with side of fries or tots for $5 until today. I walked in today and learned that the burgers went to $9 and NO LONGER INCLUDE THE SIDE!  The side is an additional $3 on top of that overpriced burger. How do you go from $5 to $12 overnight?  You are now in the Bad Daddy's realm of pricing--and you cannot compete with the taste and atmosphere. Plus their GF buns are way better.

Was a good thing while it lasted I guess. I went from Net Promoter to Net Detractor overnight along with your insane price increase."}
{"text":"Food is excellent and most of the time the service is as well. My boyfriend and I love coming here because it's great quality burgers, locally supplied, and has the option for a gluten free meal which is amazing for my boyfriend who has a gluten allergy. But every time we have come in the past few months, there have been no gluten free buns available, and most of the time we're there the milkshake machine is broken or sweet potato fries are out. For a place that markets itself for their gluten free options and traditional American meals, it's very disappointing to show up hoping for the amazing fries and burgers and he told things aren't there or they're broken. I know that sometimes supplies run out, but come on, every time we've been there the past few months, the gluten free buns are out and we have to, unfortunately, take our business elsewhere. Food is awesome, but get the supply orders in check please! We miss eating here!"}
{"text":"I've visited Barrel Burgers twice over that last year and have had a decent experience overall. The burgers are a step above Burger King, but are less enjoyable than Red Robin. This last time we went, I was impressed with the service. It was a Friday evening and, even though their Facebook page said they were open until 9pm, they closed at 8. Lucky for us, we arrived shortly before 8 and the lonely cook got to work on the burgers. 

While we were waiting on our burgers, a few people approached to order and he explained that Barrel Burgers was closed for the night. Everyone seemed understanding enough and went on their merry way. All except one lady: she came back and curtly asked the cook, \"you seriously can't make 3 burgers?!\" He tried to explain to her, again, that they were closed. And again she insisted. He agreed. She then asked for some special organic topping. The poor guy had to go all the way to the back of the store to get it because he had already put it away. Keep in mind, this is all while our burgers are cooking. Then, when he asked if she wanted a bag, she declined because she and her two little girls were going to eat it there. Not \"there\" as in the dining area, but \"there\" as up at the bar area where he was going to be attempting to close down. And then, 20 years from now, we will want to know why it is that those 2 girls feel so entitled...

That customer service is what earned the 4th star."}
{"text":"I went to the WF salad bar while my husband opted for a local, organic grass fed burger from Barrels. I'd give a 3.5 for the overall experience.

He got the Cali burger which came with guacamole, bacon, tomato and onion. They also offer a variety of additional toppings for $1 and tons of free toppings. The burger patty was a bit small for the bun but the bacon was ample. I liked the burger and I appreciate the grass fed beef, though my husband describes grass fed as \"more gamely.\" The service was fairly quick and the prices are reasonable. Great way to enjoy a delicious, hand crafted burger in WF. They have some great sides and outdoor seating for the summer months! Great concept and definitely offers healthy, organic \"fast food\"."}
{"text":"The burgers are dry over cooked. I understand they have to make them well done but there is no fat so dry as hell. They dress a kid up as a chef to make you feel good about a $10 burger. If he's a chef I'm Gordon Ramsey. They have my any drinks. You have to go into Whole Foods to buy one,What? He kept telling us we were looking at an old menu, we don't serve that anymore. Try Crafty burger & tap in Cornelius- at least 4 1/2 star if not 5."}
{"text":"Custom burgers, fresh ingredients, seared meat, what else could you want from a burger bar? It's not fast food so don't expect it to be slung across the counter before you finish ordering. It's handmade and excellent. Juicy and on a really nice grilled bun. Definitely worth a stop for lunch or dinner! I was in a hurry so I didn't have fries or a shake but I did have a draft beer and I'll be back."}
{"text":"Killer burgs!  Big, tasty and just yum.   Kind of pissed that they charge $9 and it doesn't come with fries.......  Makes it a pricey quick lunch, but hey, your at whole foods, so money is no object, right?"}
{"text":"I gave this review only three stars because while the food is pretty good, I am not very happy about the bad attitude that the cook has. He really acts like he hates his job and it shows. Every time I come here, I feel uncomfortable having to deal with him. Now on the other hand the burgers are excellent, fresh meat, Gastro pub style menu items. I wish this menu was coming from a real sit down kind of joint though. So the three stars is factored by atmosphere and negative attitude of the cook. If these things were satisfactory I'd give it four stars four and a half if I could."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the food. I got a turkey burger with sweet potato tots and my husband got a burger with pimento cheese and fried egg. The burgers were really juicy and they had some really unique sauces for dipping like beet ketchup. We did think it was a little pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and always forget to grab one for the road when I am at Whole Foods.  I really like the fact that they have grass fed beef burgers.  Good sized burgers and lots of options.   

I had the traditional cheese burger and the flavor was good.   I wish that they used a little seasoning on the burgers but you could tell that the meat was good.   

Service was pretty quick as they didn't have a big line when I arrived.   Paying can be a little weird as you pay at the registers.  

Would repeat."}
{"text":"This place serves the best burgers in town.  Made with all natural ingredients and grass fed beef.  They also have a pretty good quinoa burger in case you don't eat beef.  The fries are good too!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Huge portions and fresh!! I got the turkey burger and most turkey burgers are on the drier side! This was so good! And huge. I got no bun and they loaded it up with toppings. Sweet potato tots are enough to share for 2 people. It's $9 dollars for either bison/turkey/beef or a non-meat alternative! Can't beat it. Best burger locally 

Also! Plenty o' Beer on draft!"}
{"text":"Located inside the Whole Foods, you can walk up to the window outside or order inside.  They have a selection of burgers or you can make your own.  I had the Mediterranean & hubs had the South of the Border, both very good.  They also have sweet potato or regular fries, both good but the sweet potato fries were my favorite.  You can add toppings to your fries and get pretty creative with your heart attack selections.  (But hey, my purchases from Whole Foods should offset this, right?)

Tons of outdoor seating, corn hole & such or you can cozy up inside. Great spot to grab lunch or dinner.  Nice addition to the LKN area.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Second visit way better than the first when they were closing as we were finishing in the grocery part of the store. Who'd have thunk it'd be like that?
Lovely bride got a Cali Burger on a free-gluten bun (bun should have been off to the side as requested) with just a wee smear of whack-a-mole under the tomatoe while I opted for the \"Southern Burger\" that arrived as advertised along with a forgettable draft. Aside from the bun thing the burgers were respectable at $5 and $6 (with a $5 beer a $2.50 chocolate bar lunch was exactly $20 which was sorta spooky) adequately toppinged and cooked through without burning, also moist but not dripping fat. Sides are generous and we wound up taking half of the tots and sweet taters home.
Burgers took much longer to prepare than we were told, and we probably could have gotten our shopping done instead of sitting watching the cook go through a dozen gloves making our lunch (yea for gloves!) Next time we'll do just that and get the food to go. Take-out is in reclaimed-paper paper boxes that should have some heat retention capacity."}
{"text":"This place has nothing on Five Guys. My bun was stale, the beef was bland, ground very coarsely, and had some bits of gristle in it. There is also no soda fountain, so you are forced to buy a small canned or bottled drink. The only saving grace was the fries."}
{"text":"They say the beef is organic, who knows. They will only cook the meat to well-done for supposedly food safety reasons. This means the beef will always be dry, chewy, tasteless, hard to digest, and less nutritious. 

My friend says the vegan burger filled with processed ingredients tastes good."}
{"text":"8/31/2017 - Still the best burger, fries and tots around. No hormones and the price even dropped from when they first opened. Though the old menu had more exotic options, the current menu is still delicious. Barrel Burger beats Barcelona, Char Grill and any other burgers around. Still my fav hands down.


Best burger in the area! Always my top choice when I'm craving a burger. Everything is fresh and delicious. Best part about it is besides the burger itself, it's connected to Whole Foods so it's a double whammy! I've tried Char Grill and other local burger spots in the area and nothing compares."}
{"text":"I finally got to try Barrel Burgers.  Nestled aside Whole Foods Market in Huntersville, this place offers freshly grilled made to order burgers with fresh \"healthier\" toppings (i.e. mixed greens vs. iceberg lettuce).  

You walk up to the bar to place your order and then wait 10-15 minutes as it is prepared.  Customer service was lacking, as the Grillmaster keyed the order into the computer and slapped the burger on the grill.  There is no table service, and seating is somewhat limited.  Although there is additional seating outdoors, or over in the Whole Foods Market area.

They offer a few brews on tap, but no other beverages are available unless purchased over in the market separately.  The burger was decent.  I wouldn't call it the best burger that I've ever had, but it certainly wasn't horrible either.  There just wasn't much wow factor.  The fries were rather plain with some overly charcoaled tips.  Both the burger and the fries could've used some seasoning.

As a close option to my office, I definitely think this could become a part of my lunch rotation, but I'm in no hurry to tell a friend."}
{"text":"I love the concept of this place. Good, real food at an affordable price. As often as we visit Whole Foods, I never ventured to Barrel Burgers but my son kept asking and I am that mother that often gives in. 

I was excited to see that they had an option for Gluten Free buns so I opted to have a burger myself. I was going to order a regular burger for my son but she said the kid burger and their regular burgers are the same size so no need for us to spend a little more money.

Our burgers were not as dry as other reviews mentioned but they could have been cooked a little less. I would ask the next time I was there if they can cook to a preferred temperature. But we did enjoy the burger itself. It was pretty flavorful and for the price of $5/$6 for a grass fed burger with fries or tots - I am not complaining at all. We opted for tots and fries and both were equally delish.

Just know that whatever you order, the only thing that comes on is the items listed on the menu description. So if you want mayo, mustard or anything extra you will have to ask.

The burgers were small, I wasn't sure if it was because our burgers were on a GF bun or what but still mighty in taste. 3.5 stars overall."}
{"text":"Two entirely separate reviews here... The burger was just ok. Thick patty but dry as hell and not nearly big enough to handle the size of the bun.  Flavor was fine with the Barrel Sauce, onions and pickles.

The fries though.... OMG!  Five stars and beyond.  Crispy on the outside, creamy potato goodness on the inside.  Cannot recommend highly enough.  BUT... Make sure you get them hot out of the fryer.  As I sat at the bar waiting on my burger, I saw the cooks pick up some old ones out of the bowl they toss them in with salt/pepper, comment on how these were limp and not good but still put them in the basket next to the burger ordered by another customer.

I'll likely go elsewhere for a burger fix but will be hard pressed not to pick up an order of fries to eat in the car on the way home after a grocery shopping trip!"}
