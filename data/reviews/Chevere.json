{"text":"This is typical Venezuelan food that I grew up with! The arepa pabellón was absolutely delicious, such like I would've eaten in Caracas! I'm thrilled! It's worth the trip!"}
{"text":"So good! I've been going to Chevere for a few months now and everything I've had has been really excellent and reasonably priced. My favorite is the arepa with shredded beef, plantains, and black beans. The staff are very friendly, and it's still a bit of a secret! Once the word gets out, there will be lines around the block, I just hope it does get to that point."}
{"text":"So I've been meaning to go here since they opened and today I got my chance.  I asked for an arepa with carnita's and they had a plate of plantains and I asked if they were selling them as well.  The good man said you like plantain? Of course I said yes and he proceeded to make me an arepa that was out of this world.  Carnita plantain black bean and crumbled cheese.   I work in town less than a half dozen blocks away and will be coming back here often. Cash only for now so hit up the ATM there are many close by.   It's next to the garage on Cherry Way where the old Primantis Bros was located."}
{"text":"This little South American place has only opened in the past week, and if you didn't walk by or work near it you would never know it's there. I haven't seen any advertising or found any social pages for it. Hopefully over time word gets out that it's here, because they're a lovely replacement for the previous eatery.  Chévere looks pretty unassuming when you walk by, especially because part of the place is more or less empty except for a counter. There's no seating, although I did see people standing and eating at said counter. The other half of the place houses the workers and the food line, and this is definitely where the action is. The place is a little bit like Chipotle in that you order what you want and as it goes down the line, the staff can add any toppings/filling you want. You can order individual items or spring for a combo; if you do get a drink, you can pick up a cup and fill it up on your way out.  So what can you order? Pretty affordable tacos, empanadas and arepas. And the place may seem pretty unassuming, but the food that I ordered today was great. I tasted a fair bit of seasoning on the empanada and arepa shells, and the meat that came with both was juicy and tender. The flavors here can definitely hold their own against some of the other eateries selling similar items.  Quick and tasty, I can recommend that you try this place if you're in the area. The only downside was that I had to wash my slightly greasy hands after eating my meal, so this may not necessarily be the place for a mess-free \"eat it on the go\" sort of meal just yet. Still, the food was delicious, and I'm looking forward to becoming a regular at Chévere."}
{"text":"omg omg omg. HOW did I not know about this place until now! I had to run an errand downtown on my lunch break and had every intention of going back to the office and eating my can of soup but then I spotted Chevere...  Arepas? Empanadas? Tacos? Choripan? be still my heart. I really struggled with what to get because everything looked and sounded sooo good. I decided on the $9 combo that included an arepa of your choice, taco of your choice and a drink. I had the pernil arepa which is seasoned pork with lettuce, pico and guac and a Carne Asada taco with cheese and guac. OMG -- it was AMAZING and sooo much food. I was literally stuffed and i didn't finish it all.   Everything was so fresh and tasty. Once you get your order there is a little side bar when you get get cilantro, lime and red and green salsa. I was pumped about this because I like alot of cilantro.   I almost wish I didn't discover this place, because it's going to be too tempting on a regular basis!"}
{"text":"Really great arepas - which are like little sandwiches - and empanadas.  While the place is super tiny and only has standing room to eat, it's well worth  a visit.  It's tucked inside the parking garage that used to Macy's parking garage on Cherry Way.  I got a pork empanada that was flavorful and filled with pork.  It was slightly greasy, but you expect that with an empanada filled with pork.  I also got shredded beef, plantain, cheese and black bean arepa which was hands down amazing.  Tons of beef, the plantain was really great and the cheese was lovely and melty.  It came with some avocado cream sauce that I kind of wanted to pick up and drink, but I refrained.   All in all, a great, cheap meal.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is one of the best tapa spots I've ever been to. The arepa I had was AMAZING, the steak was so juicy and the guacamole y salsa was so fresh. Definitely recommend for spur of the moment quick meal with a few friends or a significant other."}
{"text":"This brand new place is great!   The basics:  It's in the bottom of the parking garage formerly known as the Macy's parking garage.  The menu is tacos, empanadas, and arepas, with different meats and combo meal options.  You choose all of your toppings and sides and carry out (I guess you could also eat at the counter there, but it's definitely geared toward takeout.   The food:  I tried a pork arepa and chicken empanada, and both were delicious.  High points also to the guacamole.  I feel like a bad arepa is still basically a religious experience, and these were excellent arepas.   The price:  Cheap.  Yay.  It's cash only for now, but there are four ATMs within one block.  Go here for lunch immediately."}
{"text":"This food is pretty good. I did the #3 combo of a taco and a arepa. You basically pick a protein and then it is sort of like Subway with picking toppings, such as lettuce, salsa, etc. Not as many toppings as Subway, plus some like guacamole and chimichurri cost extra. I did a carne asado arepa, which was very tasty. Next, I tried a seafood taco, which was fish and two pieces of shrimps. It was also good, but it wasn't clear that there was an up charge for seafood. Both were good, but I felt like it just wet my appetite at $11. The portions are on the small side and I could've used another taco or side. With that said, I would say that the value is not quite inline with the cost and probably would make this place a 3.5 star place. Worth a shot to try for sure,  but it could become a very pricey lunch."}
{"text":"I just moved downtown for work, so after typing \"lunch\", limiting myself to a single dollar sign and zooming in the map to span a 3 block radius around where I work, I landed here.  I have found my happy place.  The gentlemen running the place were super helpful on my first visit, letting my try a plantain after I was maybe a bit over enthusiastic upon finding that plantains were an option.    I wound up getting an arepa (shredded beef) and a hard taco (steak).  Both were amazing, and maybe a little too much food for lunch, making this place a fantastic place to get a $5 lunch.  I haven't finished my arepa yet, and I already can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This is a really good South American street food place! I tried a seafood arepa with a chicken empanada, and got some guac to go with it. Both really good!  The portions aren't overly large, but they're not small either. For the lower price, it's not half bad. I will be frequenting this place often!  Once they start taking cards this will be a no-brainer for most folks downtown. For now though, hit up one of the ATMs close by :)"}
{"text":"Hands down, best arepa you'll get in the city. Great options and great customer service. HIGHLY recommend"}
{"text":"This place is brand new. Kind of like don't judge a book by its cover situation. The food is on point. I had a the fish tacos it was spicy and very flavorful. The green salsa is very fresh and so authentic, they should sell it in bulk. Try the black beans. I came to this place on a whim and so glad I did."}
{"text":"The best place to have a meal in downtown whether you are on the go or looking to dine in. Chevere has excellent authentic Venezuelan food served by kind and welcoming people. They serve tacos and empanadas but the Venezuelan arepas are the way to go. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Will definitely be going back. I had shredded chicken arepas, a chicken empanada, and a side of black beans. Everything was delicious. Support immigrant businesses in Pittsburgh and eat here!"}
{"text":"OMG! This little place is absolutely amazing! Yesterday, I stumbled across this little gem in downtown Pittsburgh. I was looking for something authentic in the Hispanic cuisine and found them. I've never had an arepa before and it was simply delicious.   The pastry like bread was so fresh and airy. I tried it with the pork and had them dress it traditional style. It had the pork, guacamole, pico, and queso fresco. It was simply amazing. The meat was full of flavor and the toppings were fresh.   I had a combo 3 which also came with a taco. I tried their carne asada on hard shell with rice, beans, pico, guacamole, and cheese. The meat was full of flavor and melted in my mouth.   I am very much happy to know this place is around. I will be frequenting them often and recommend folks giving them a try."}
{"text":"I usually pack my lunch, but I'm glad I forgot it today! I remembered seeing something I wanted try in the old primantis location a few weeks back, but couldn't remember what it was. I followed my guts to this South American street food spot. Service was fast and friendly. They serve empanadas, arepas, tacos, choripan, and a couple other items. I ordered the combo #2 for $8.50. It came with a drink, a ground beef empanada, and slow cooked pork arepa. They have other meats to choose from, the shredded chicken and steak looked juicy and flavor packed so I'll have to go back and try them. The beef inside the empanada was well seasoned and i added their hot sauce, which was very spicy with a decent flavor, more of a pepper flavor than vinegar, which I like. The empanada tasted fresh and had a fried corn based outer shell. Very good. The corn based pork arepa was phenomenal. The meat was perfectly seasoned, juicy, and tender. There weren't any fatty pieces like you usually get with slow cooked pork. They have a set up that allows you to choose your fillings. The guacamole tasted fresh and creamy. I loved the Spanish cheese options that went with it. The arepa shell may have been one of the best I've had. I can't wait to forget my lunch again and try everything else on their menu. Loved it!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome. Friendly staff and quick service. I got the steak arepa and the shredded beer arepa. Both were delicious! I definitely love adding the guacamole, pick, and cheese. Each meat arepa is $4.50 and one can fill you up but I wanted to try both and am super full now. Walking by you might miss this place, but it can be easily found if you're looking. Inside, there are a couple of standing tables, but no where to sit."}
