{"text":"Customer satisfaction is not a high priority at this cleats in Parma Heights. We go here once every month or two, but only because friends or coworkers insist. If you want beers and cold wings, when the waitresses are available, you're Golden. But note that they will charge you for anything they can, with NO flexibility.

We were there last week... I ordered chips with my sandwich... I requested a bottle of hot sauce for my chips.. found out after leaving a paid for a side of 'hot' wing sauce. 

Flash forward to tonight.. my wife ordered wings with no sauce but wanted ranch on the side... we were charged extra for the ranch.

Also, my nephew ordered a wing and chip combo.. chips were ice cold... he requested a fresh serving.. she brought more (cold) chips and said: 'You know the chips are normally served this way, we make them around 1:00'. This was at 8pm! I've had the chips 40+ times over 10 years - they're usually at least warm.

I questioned the waitress when we were cashing out and she would not make any adjustment to our bill. She would not even remove the $0.75 charge for the ranch.

I am NOT going back. Me and someone elses flem do not mix."}
{"text":"Cleats is always a great place to go if you are looking to watch a sporting event. There are many TV's and they are more than willing change the channels so that you can watch a particular game. I disagree with PW, that they have the best wings in Cleveland. They are average wings, and actually the garlic parmesean are kind of gross (they smell like throw-up!). I also would not suggest the onion rings. I have ordered them at least a dozen times and they are always undercooked and soggy in the middle. Most of the bartenders are very nice, but sometimes they can seem annoyed if they are busy and you ask them for something. The outdoor patio is really nice in the summer. There is plenty of seating and is always a good time."}
{"text":"As always. Great food. Loved the fish Tacos. Ribs, fajitas. Everything was excellent."}
{"text":"Bug in my salad. Disgusting. At least they didn't charge us. But if bugs are in the salad, what else is crawling around the kitchen?"}
{"text":"For the most part food is alright, service is always great. Staff is good and personable! Reasonable priced."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE!!   I would give less than 1 star if possible!   I am not from Cleveland and a co-worker took me here.  After about 10 minutes of neglect in service I finally grabbed a waitress to ask if we could order.  She looked at me as if I was burden.  I suggested we leave then, but the co-worker talked me into staying.  Bad choice!   they say sometimes people spit in your food in places like this.  they went over and above on that one.  I had a burger - texas Hold-em something.   Please understand I can eat ANYTHING and never have issues.  Hot spicy, buffet sushi, whatever.  I should have know when the waitress gave me this snotty grin when she gave me the check.  About 5pm that day I had dinner plans and out of nowhere I had the WORST stomach pains I have ever had!   I puked twice at the dinner resteraunt and all I could picture was that waitress and burger!  It is two days after the fact and I am still feeling bad.   Learn from my experience....you will regret it!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for athletic foot wear you will be disappointed... Staff is great and they even let us mix wing sauces.  I recommend Mixing Honey Mustard with some Six Pepper Blend. Atmosphere is fun as 8 big screens around the bar show a variety of sports. We watched a Giambi game winning home run and everyone celebrated like we were at the game. They also have a variety of beers on tap. Also a cool collection of bobble heads and various autographed memorabilia.   If you are looking for sports, boobs and beer it's here."}
{"text":"Something has happened here that is not positive.  A noticeable lack of customers on a recent visit for one.  I am not pleased with their new menu since some of my favorites were removed.  The burger I had  was unremarkable.  Not good by most standards.  Service was acceptable.  Other diner had a Reuben which was also acceptable., noticeable lack of flavor was the comment.  Will look for another restaurant when we visit this area in the future!"}
{"text":"What would I like to say about Cleats? Nothing good. This was my boyfriend's favorite local bar/restaurant when I moved here 9 months ago. The quality has decreased exponentially since last summer. The food is bad, and the newer management/staff is worse. We've stayed away recently because the last time my boyfriend went, the manager was so busy flirting with the staff that nobody bothered to serve him, even though they acknowledged he was there. Tonight when he wanted to go, I suggested that we go somewhere else because he would be disappointed. We ordered, and everything was okay until he went to the bathroom. There was literally dried excrement all over the men's room. The manager was sitting at the bar chatting. We canceled our order and will not be back. At least Cleats is dependable in its disappointment."}
{"text":"Laid back atmosphere, great menu, and the service is decent."}
{"text":"I was there on a weekday for lunch. It was very nice, good food, good service.

Decided to go out with a friend Friday night to have some fun. The place was almost empty and we quickly realized why. There were 4 or 5 drunk, out of control patrons loud, jumping around and disturbing others at and around the bar. The employees not only did nothing, but seemed to be friends of the group and contributed to the mayhem. 

Couples at the bar were visibly annoyed, one family moved to other side of restaurant. They were not using the nice outdoor area....I guess so employees could stay in and have fun, or so many customers have been driven away."}
{"text":"First, let me say that the wings at Cleats will always be my favorite. I like them better than Winking Lizard, BW3, Quaker Steak or any similar joints. This review is more like a \"SERIOUSLY???\" kind of review. We were a group of 6 hungry people who trooped to Cleats at Middleburg Heights at 7:00PM on a saturday night.  The place was not busy at all and we were asked to seat ourselves. We had to wait until our table was  cleared but that was not a big deal. However,  when we placed out order of wings, we were told that they ran out of wings.  let me say that again...7:00PM on a saturday night and they ran out of wings...7:00PM not 10:30PM, not 12:30AM but 7:00PM.   Our server said that it will take them 20 minutes so we decided to wait for the wings because I was really craving for it. Well, the 20 minutes became an hour but I was ok with that and we got a free round of drinks out of it.  From a place that touts itself for having the \"World's Best Wings\", running out of wings so early into a weekend night is laughable. Like i said...seriously?!?!?!?"}
{"text":"Ordered the chili, wife had the Sliders on pretzel bun, fries and french onion soup. The Chili tasted as if it was burnt. The chips that came with it were stale. Wife thought the sliders were OK once she added catchup and salt. I found the burger meat to be tasteless and very greasy. It's been several years since we were there because the food was bad. Was looking to see if had gotten any better, it hasn't. I would not recommend. Too many good restaurants to waste money here."}
{"text":"Cleats wings are best in the area, no doubt.  39 cents on Tues & Weds.  I was a Cleats fan when they only had the N. Royalton store, but go to the Westlake store now only because I live close to it.  I disagree with comments about 'unimaginative' and 'generic'.  The place's mantra is it's wings and big screens - anyone can throw some sports photos on a wall and call themselves a sports bar nowadays.    I go for the food, that's what a restaurant is to me - a few less Tiger Woods photos on the wall won't make me sad (haha).    As for the service of this particular location, I've noticed it to be hit or miss, but never outright awful.   If you want better service, I highly recommend the Strongsville or Steelyard spots for this chain.  Overall though, a much better value and food for the buck, than most."}
{"text":"Great price for thier wing sampler $18.99 for 30 wings/fries. Tons of flavor choices. Unique burgers/sandwiches."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants and bars in town. Great staff, nice atmosphere, and fun events.  A staple here in Chardon."}
{"text":"I normally go out to eat three nights a week and prefer to find a place close to home. That's why we we close Cleats about once a week, After our last experience it may be my last. The spouse ordered a appetizer platter of tenders, onion rings, pretzel sticks,, cheese sticks and fries. Two half size tenders, four onion rings, two cheese sticks, four pretzels on a plate of fries for 10.99. When the spouse questioned the meal the waitress said the manager already is aware of issues with that menu item. We got a polite apology and nothing else. 


Maybe that's why they have $2 drafts. Needless to say I won't be taking the spouse their again. All I heard after we left is how bad the meal was and they refused to do anything about it."}
{"text":"It's a lazy version of Applebees. Service was slower, unattentive wait staff at times. Quality of food was fair, expect a cheaper cut of everything with meat. 

Drinks tasted like watered down soda. After bringing it up two separate occasions, wait staff acted like we had the problem. Several times waiting to leave, it took 15 minutes or more to get our card back after paying. 

Food is fairly cheap, it's tolerable in most situations, but would recommend no mixed drinks and simpler meals. Ribs and steaks are poor quality."}
{"text":"I have agree with most of the posts. The servers seem to busy with chatting they taking orders, and checking on their customer needs. Seeing that I'm only 5 minutes from this Cleats, I religiously go out of my way to the North Royalton and Strongsville location for better quality food and atmosphere. I rather travel 30 minutes out of way than to deal with this location."}
{"text":"Came here about a year ago and loved it. Atmosphere was great, server was superb, and food was pretty good. My wife and I came back a couple weeks ago expecting a similar experience. From start to finish it was a complete joke. 

We came in and were sat in the booths by the long wall of windows. The windows were incredibly drafty, we felt the wind blowing through the entire time. We ordered nachos for our appetizer and they came out freezing cold. Server said she'd give us new ones, but we just asked if they could heat them up since we were starving and it took forever for them to come out the first time around. We also ordered a burger and buffalo Mac n cheese. Both of them were below average at best. It tasted like they dumped an entire bottle of hot sauce on the Mac n cheese. Not sure why it was even spicy because it didn't call for it. The server routinely disappeared and got all of our food modifications wrong because she didn't write down anything. Huge pet peeve when servers don't write down orders, it basically seemed like she didn't care enough to put in the effort. Sadly this place used to be a solid destination for some good bar food and service. I feel like it's under new management now and they just don't care. We won't be back to this location any time soon."}
{"text":"Good place to watch a football game.  Bartenders are attentive and friendly.  Boneless wings with hot sauce and Kentucky bourbon sauce are yummy (my occasional treat).  WiFi does not work.  Boo hiss."}
{"text":"This was my first Cleats experience.  I was so upset after we sat down when our waitress was COMPLETELY MIA.  Finally, literally two seconds before my hungry husband was ready to huff out, someone took our order.   Then someone else sort of brought our drinks (they brought the wrong thing) then the first person brought the right ones.  Then someone else brought our food and well into it, \"our\" waitress finally stopped by.  She was horrible.  She insulted her other large table who was obviously frustrated with her.  But that's her- I don't think all of them are like that.

The food was ok - the standard \"we're dipping chicken nuggets in sauce and calling it boneless wings\" affair.  The curly fries were just like Arby's - I would have preferred non-battered fries.  The chili cheese fry was MASSIVE - I don't know WHO could ever eat that.  They should warn you that it's enough for four people.  It was ok - too much chili and not enough cheese.

The sauces were alright.  Sweet heat was way to hot for people like me that love a good sweet heat sauce.  I couldn't find any vinegar based sauces.  

At least the price wasn't outrageous and the atmosphere was OK."}
{"text":"Basic pub fare, but worse, and pricey. Not even worth the groupon purchase. And \"MP\" for wings? PRETENTIOUS!"}
{"text":"Cleats is exactly what you would expect from a classic sports bar. Great place to hang out, have a couple beers and done bar food with your friends. The Buffalo chicken sandwich is really good as is the Chicken Cobb Salad, which is huge. Also they have pretty good wings and quite a variety of sauces."}
{"text":"Not a big fan. Wings are not very good but the shrimp tacos were decent. They always have Columbus IPA on draft and  a couple from Great Lakes, but other than that, tbeer list is the standard bud/miller/coors."}
{"text":"We used to love Cleats when they were in Warren so when we saw this one we were excited. We used our Yelp! Check in bonus to score a free appetizer of fried mozzarella and it was really good. Crunchy exterior and oooey gooey center. Excellent start. From there the meal pales -- my daughter had a chicken Caesar pita with about 4 small cubes of chicken to it and both my sister and I ordered the Wednesday Wing special of boneless wings for 59 cents. They were good sized but he breaking was way too much and way over done. The large fry was HUGE and we had way too many to eat -- and they went cold fast. I would recommend it for a table app for sharing as it was so large and if it was hot would have been great."}
{"text":"I don't like Cleats. I have written about the wonders of Parma. This is the place I go to when I am frustrated with myself or marred by varying levels of self-loathing. 

I have only had the wings. The wings are the only redeeming quality of the place. The wings are generally above average. I would not tout the wings as the best in Cleveland as they do because this is somewhat preposterous. This food is generally for primitives that yell at TVs populated with athletes. I would never dare venture during Cleveland Browns game as apeshit bro culture causes me anxiety and fear.

The truth of this review is that the service is terrible. I have not experienced a server who has not tried to angle some level of industry wage injustice or ineptitude or both. There is one young man who I would like punch in the face if I was given to violence. He is antagonizing. I would pleasure in seeing his face rubbed on the disintegrating gravel pit of a parking lot that Cleats calls home.

I sense now that this review is dripping with vitriol. I believe I am due for another visit very soon. Like that wing sauce."}
{"text":"The good: Wings, ribs, nachos, sandwiches, soups, lunch specials, bar, many large flat screens.

The bad: Music way too loud (can't talk to the person next to you or hear the game), spotty inconsistent service.  Also when going outside to enjoy the patio having to endure the stink from the smokers."}
{"text":"I wish this place was better. The food is okay, and the drink prices are nothing to write home about, but if you're into the generically run unimaginative sports bar chain(s) then this is the place for you.  The weekends seem to fill the place up with the soccer mom crowd, and other middle aged suburbanites."}
{"text":"Service was decent.  Food was AWFUL.  I had a baked potato and it was like sawdust.  My family had fries which were cold along the burgers ordered.  There was no seasoning on the burgers and they were overcooked and dry.  The loaded tater tots were the best food ordered.  They were pretty good.  The ceiling was leaking and my shoes stuck to the bathroom floor.  Definitely not worth $53."}
{"text":"This was our first time eating lunch here.  The hostess was extremely friendly & I also found out while ordering our drinks she was the also the bartender.  I loved the music selection that was being played throughout the dining area and the long island iced tea was perfectly made.  I had a salad and my husband had the daily special of burger and fries.  Our waitress was forgetful but she was still friendly and was able to meet our needs. (we thought maybe she was new at the position) we will definitely dine here again."}
{"text":"I liked this sports bar/dive bar. Besides their nice outdoor patio, they had some healthy options on their menu that you don't normally see and I appreciated. Don't get me wrong I ate completely unhealthy things, but I liked the sentiment :)"}
{"text":"Did you ever go to a restaurant and wanted to leave?well we should of. The server acted like oh well another customer i have to wait on. My wiges salad as she stayed was not good.the chicken was hard not warm and no flavor. My burger i requested medium.the burger was charred no taste at,all.never saw the server untill bill arrived.never asked any thing like how was food
 ?.well sorry that we bothered you miss server."}
{"text":"Our service was superb.  I ordered a baked potato with black beans and corn on the side as I am eating plant based with no oil.  They happily accommodated me.  My husband had a hamburger which he also enjoyed.  No complaints!"}
{"text":"I've only been here twice and hope to up that number soon. This used to be Maxx Doogans, which was a lovely restaurant chain with three locations close to me. When Cleats bought it out I assumed I would hate it. This was not the case. The food is fantastic (I recommend the chicken Cesar wrap), the wait staff helpful and friendly, and the ambiance was nice even for a sports bar. ( I am not a sports fan, but love eating here anyway) If you're looking for a great place to eat, go to Cleats!"}
{"text":"I went to cleats today for lunch to try their wings. After sitting at the bar for 15 minutes the bartender finally came for a drink order. There were only 5 other people there. She got my drink said she would be right back. After a 10 minute wait I got up and left."}
{"text":"Greeted before entering the restaurant with 3 people smoking at the main entrance blowing smoke in our face. Then to find out they changed the menu and do not have 1 vegetarian dish except salad. Very disappointing. Won't be back"}
{"text":"The group of 4 had a $50 gift certificate to use. The server was not attentive to drink refills, she could not tell us which chicken wings were which from the 5 varieties we ordered nor much about the different flavors. We had to ask fir set ups, side plates and condiments. The 2 papertowel dispensers in the ladies room were empty and it was not busy."}
{"text":"I miss living in Westlake because this place was right downt he street.  The bartenders here are great and always friendly.  They have a ton of food specials during the week.  Trying to remember but Mondays are $3.00 apps and Tuesdays are wing days.  Wings have to ordered in 6's I think.  The Erie Island Smoke and six pepper blend are fantastic and both are a dry rub.  Try them and you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"I really don't like this place.  Not going to say hate because that might be a little strong.  I've been to this place twice and have received horrible service both times.  The two stars are for the wings.  First time I went with a friend.  We told the server we wanted to try a bunch of different wings and asked what sizes were available.  She told us we could only get the wings in intervals of six.  we ordered several types on her recommendation (at first we were like how nice, we didn't even need to look in the menu because she was so knowledgable).  Little did we know that we could have ordered a sampler platter for about half the price.  Stupid little trip took us for a ride.  After we ordered our service went down the tubes.  She never came back, we had to stand up and find her for the check.  Where was she?  Kickin back at the beverage station.  She sucked.
Trip two.  Wanted something to eat and it was late.  Cleats was the first place we came across.  Went in, place was almost empty, went up to the bar and ordered quesadillas.  Was told it would take fifteen minutes or less.  Waited 20.  Asked bar tender where they were and was told they weren't ready yet.  30 minutes.  Noticed a to-go behind the bar.  Asked if our order was up yet.  Told no.  45 minutes.  Asked again.  No.  The whole time bar tender (an almost weathered chick) is flirting with pervy old guy.  Found a manager and asked.  He checks in the kitchen then goes out to the bar.  Order is in bag behind the bar and has been for the last 25 minutes.  Manager asked if we want it reheated.  I laugh in his face and walk out. 

Made a vow to never come back.  Have kept said vow for quite some time now and am proud of accomplishment."}
{"text":"Service was very slow. Parking lot and walkway covered in ice. Restaurant on was to freezing cold. Food was served cold. Not a good experiance at all."}
{"text":"Always nice. Never had greasy wings like others are complaining. I go weekly. Reasonable prices. And not at all divey. If you have a gathering they put a nice saying or phrase on the sign. Nice place and not fussy"}
{"text":"Cleats ain't nothin' fancy. It's a sports bar. Don't expect salmon en croute or fresh duck foie -- but, if you're like me and love 1) big-ass burgers with Man vs. Food-sized sides, and 2) big TVs that play only sports (for those lulls in conversation with your hetero lifemate), then I suspect that this place is good for what ails you. The buffalo chicken sandwich I got was shockingly tasty, and they have totally decent beers on draft...plus, uh, Miller Lite."}
{"text":"So I took a break from watching Season 1 of \"Too Close For Comfort\" (Jim J Bullok's finest work I might add) and wanted to grab lunch.  Had a Groupon burning a hole in my digital pocket and decided to take the folks and my lil one to get food and a bunch of beers.  Everytime I come here it reminds me of all the fun times I had when it was Hooters.  Man I miss those big...wings..  We had a great lunch.  All the food was super good for bar food.  Cleats has really spruced up their menu and is surpassing the Lizard and BW3 for sure.  More healthy and different flavors.  Not just chicken fingers and 1980s ranch dressing.  Ranch is the food equivalent of Flock of Seaguls...still around but needs to be put down like a diseased llama.  The servers were all great and genuinely friendly.  Something ya dont see much anymore.  They have a pretty decent beer selection but dont go looking for a Trappist beer or anything.  I would have no problem coming back here.  Its very kid friendly and family friendly.  And as Newbaum Turk says: TO THE PIE WAGON!"}
{"text":"Worst money every spent. I've had better service at Wendy's! We dined in this evening and experienced the worst customer service ever! We arrive, waited about 10 minutes to even get noticed and the place was dead! The waitress takes our order never asks us what side dishes we wanted, she just \"assumed\" we wanted french fries. WE waited 45 minutes for a sampler platter fries and 2 sandwiches which I find completely unacceptable from a place that was empty!!!!!! When the food arrives there was more fries on the plates with the sandwiches than on the $22.00 sampler platter! I tell the waitress about it and she acted as if she didn't care. The waitress brought us out plates that were wet! Never came back around to see if we needed more drinks or offer to clean our table. We had to track down another waitress to ask for napkins which at one point must have gotten annoying to her because she decided to start giving us dirty looks. We watched as they whispered and we knew they were taking about us and it's not like we were some rowdy people. It was my husband , my son, my daughter and her boyfriend. Normal family of five. Even when I paid for my food she gave me this stare down like she wanted to say something to me or maybe meet me in the parking lot. Definitely not kid friendly, My 9 year old son could sense the tension and couldn't wait to leave.  The whole dining experience was sloppy. I know it's a bar/grille but no smiles, no saying thank you nothing. I will never step foot in this place again. ZERO dollars for a tip and a note on the receipt that stated worst customer service ever! I think the owner should be ashamed of the Parma Hts. location.  Very disappointed as this was once my favorite place for wings. Close this location and invest money in expanding the Strongsville location!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular at the Old Brooklyn Cleats which I LOVE. We This place was a roller coaster ride start to finish. 

Atmosphere: divey. Not as nice as the Steelyard location. Really bad music (read Lil Wayne). 

Waitress: thought she was sweet at first. But asked us if we wanted ranch, blue cheese, and celery. I said sure. Extra $2.25 charge without mentioning it. Claimed it was on the menu, manager confirmed it was not. Blue cheese tasted like chemicals. 

Beer: in plastic mugs. No. 

Other drinks: $3 special on long islands, good price. My glass was cracked down the side. 

We ordered wings and a buffalo chicken mac and cheese (!!!) pizza. 

Wings: disgusting, covered in a pool of grease. Please see photo. Soggy and I've literally had better wings from Rally's. No really. And I consider the Steelyard location as some of the best in the area. 

Pizza: absolutely delicious. I have nothing but good things to say about this. Creative and delicious. 

The pizza gets a five star, the rest I'd give a one star. The manager kept trying to justify everything by blaming it on corporate. Hey corporate, here's a tip: close this location, it's ruining your reputation. If this was the first Cleats I ever came to, I'd never give another location a chance. Luckily I love the one near me so you didn't entirely lose a customer. Take a tip from me and the rest of the reviews on here."}
{"text":"Wings are good. Management is not. I averaged eating & drinking at Cleats 2 to 3 times a month with between 4 and 8 friends since they opened about 6 years ago. Took the golf league every Monday all summer. Then went every other Tuesday all winter. Know most of the staff by name (mike would have never let the following happen). Was in Thursday to watch the Sweet 16 games with 3 friends. The owner graciously turned one of the 16 TVs in the place to the \"non-OSU\" game. Great! I can watch OSU and Marq vs Miami. Gotta love sports bars, right? How very wrong. One person behind our table asked the \"manager\" to change the TV to OSU, which now gave him 16 of 16 TVs to watch it on. While I'm staring at the game, the channel changes. I found the \"manager\" and asked if he could change it, or any of the others back as I was watching the game. He went Ricky Nelson on me and said \"ya can't please everyone\", put up his hands and said NO he would not. I thought he was kidding & was probably not as polite as I should have been at that point, but come on...it's a Sports Bar. The \"manager\" who must have been a geography major in middle school came back with \"you do live in Ohio you know\". Brilliant. Look, I was rooting for OSU too, but thought I came to a Sports Bar with multiple TVs so I would miss non of March Madness. Apparently not. Finally asked for the owner. He came over, apologized for the manger, and said to give him a few minutes & he would make it right. He then disappeared for over half an hour. I'm now guessing that he and his ignorant manager were in the back laughing at the old codger (did I mention I was 56?) and waiting for the other game to finish so it wouldn't matter. End of this story...this old codger & all of the guys he brings with him have vowed not go back again. Cleats (Happy Moose) will survive without us, but this is no way to run a service based business."}
{"text":"Not a bad place, wide selection of food and a nice craft beer selection as well. Staff is friendly and service was pretty quick. Wasn't impressed with the kettle chips, could use some sort of seasoning. Boneless wings were good, nice selections of sauces and dry rubs."}
{"text":"My husband and I have some wonderful memories here. The wings are very good. They also have some good mozzarella sticks and a good environment appropriate for the whole family. Lots of TVs, jukebox, good food for good times."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch yesterday. They were not very busy and we were seated right away. My burger was great. My wife's french onion soup was good. Our waiter was very good and checked on us often. All in all a very positive experience. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"The Snail Cats and I tried this place after our weekly soccer game. Overall it wasn't that bad but it also wasn't awesome.

I had the honey chipotle tacos. I liked them but they were a little dry. Definitely could have used more of the special sauce.

My boyfriend had the firecracker quesadilla and had the same opinion. \"Ok\" but nothing special about it. Both items were something I could have made at home no problem. Honestly, that was the general consensus from the whole table. 

After spending over a year going to Harry Buffalo next door and having more than a few bad experiences, Cleats was a nice change of pace. We are on the hunt for a new Tuesday place to eat but I am sad to say, this will not be it. It helped get the bad taste out from HB, but wasn't special enough to win the Snail Cats Tuesday ritual."}
{"text":"First off I cannot believe they took the buffalo chicken dip off of the menu.  That was one of the things that had me going back.....uurrggghh.  Anyway, Cleats one up'd a couple of the other restaurants on 306 by building a really nice outdoor patio / bar area.  The restaurant is pretty big, huge bar, lots of all around seating, and the waitstaff are easy on the eyes.  I have never had bad food here.  Sandwiches are great.  I especially enjoyed the roast beef and Gouda.  Now they do have a new menu and I haven't tried many of the new items but will in the near future.  Next to Fridays (happy hour is awesome), Cleats is the solid 2nd choice on 306 unless you want Italian or Smokey Bones.  This place is also a great joint to watch the games.  

I just remembered Hooley House, that would be another option, but I have yet to eat there."}
{"text":"Came in for $.49 wing night.  Got wings,  6 shrimp and a coke and still spent nearly $20.00 after tip.   The wings were OK.  The fried shrimp with wing sauce were a total miss.  I've had better and cheaper...  Pass"}
{"text":"So we were looking for somewhere to go in a small town that closes after 9. It was close to 10:30pm and we found this place in a small plaza just down the road from our inn.

They had \"best wings in the world\" listed on the entry way but they were by far the worst I've ever had. We ordered some wings which they sell by the pound at market price so it was  5 wings for about $5. Not bad price wise. A list of about 13 sauce and we chose sweet heat which I thought was a spicy and sweet combo and bourbon BBQ. Both sauces were disappointing and the wings were not crispy but just almost tasted baked with no seasoning, completely bland!!! The sauce gave it some life but it just tasted like sugar with a hint of bourbon. The sweet heat was awful!! It was literally blazing hot, no flavor just complete burn with maybe a pinch of sugar. The hubby was so displeased that he wasted 3 of his wings.

On the up side I did enjoy my caesar salad and the honey chipotle chicken tacos. The chicken was nice crispy but not overly warm. It was still better then those wings we ate. Not much else to say about this place other than the array of music that played and sports on TV. The beer was satisfying but most beers are usually. 

The waitress was nice and chatting with us a little while we watched the game but other than that it's nothing special."}
{"text":"My husband and I couldn't remember why we haven't come to this Cleat's in over a year - then we ordered our beers and remembered. Their \"tall\" 16 ounce beers are OUTRAGEOUSLY priced. Both our beers were warm and somewhat flat. My husbands food was OK at best, but I got the Beer Cheese Sliders - they didn't come with fries or chips, and were absolutely flavorless. Not that I was expecting gourmet food, but I don't want to have to slather Ketchup and Ranch on my burger just to get some flavor. 

Then the bill came :( Would you believe the 16 oz \"tall\" beer I ordered was $7.00?! That is the most I have ever paid for a draft beer at a sports bar. I could have bought a 6 pack of the exact same beer for that price! I would be willing to overlook the food not being good, I would just get something else next time. But to charge that much for drinks should be illegal. Oh, and don't order Ranch on the side because it costs $.75. 

Needless to say we will NEVER be returning to Cleats when there are so many other places that have good food and drink at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"The wings here are the best in Cleveland. Tuesday and Wednesday are wing night. Every flavor that I had has been great. I would not go here for wings unless they are on special. I am somewhat upset that wings have turned from scrap meat to delicacy. A friend told me that there are not enough chickens to keep up with the ever increasing demand for wings. Get them while they are still somewhat affordable!"}
{"text":"This place is strange and kind of on the run down side, but I'm still going to give it the \"A-OK\" rating. For drinks that is. Basically all Cleats are not created equal is the lesson to take away from this review. I've had a party at the Cleats in Strongsville before and this one is completely different. I've been here before though and must say I think it has kind of not been taken care of well as of late. It is much smaller than its Strongsville sister and there is no party room. Being in here definitely did not feel like you were in Westlake, let's just say that. The bar service was not very attentive (i.e., pouring the wrong drink) although the girl did seem to know a lot of the customers and after awhile did warm up to you. At $2.75 a bottle though you can't really complain."}
{"text":"Been going to cleats chains for a couple years now. Went in for a quick dinner and beer and had to watch underage girls and a military vet stumble all over the place dropping the F bomb like it was going away. The bartenders kinda laughed it off and gave them more shots. And this was all before 8 pm on a Tuesday. Food took a while, and drink was on empty for awhile. I will not be going back to this one"}
{"text":"Service is good portion size is great .... They are very pricey for wings don't like the fact that they charge you for ranch or blue cheese without telling you won't be back any time soon"}
{"text":"My husband loves the chicken fingers and fries. I bring a takeout hummus wrap from Buckeye Chocolate and we both order Long Islands. It's fast, close to home and we have fun :)"}
{"text":"The restaurant was freezing cold. I know it's cold outside but it was unbearable inside. My food got cold so fast because it was so cold. The bartender was also our server which made her unattentive to our table. We didn't get refills and got to the point where we had to go to the bar to ask for our bill and pay it. The food also took a very long time and it wasn't hot by any means. There were only 2 tables of people and a handful at the bar and the service was awful"}
