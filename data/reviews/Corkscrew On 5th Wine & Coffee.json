{"text":"Great little place, for breakfast on the go... Wine, beer, and flatbreads are all great"}
{"text":"Just like their other location the Corkscrew in 4th Ward has great staff and music. The new location  has a larger good menu and an attached coffee bar."}
{"text":"Nice staff, good place top hang for some beer or wine and a bite to eat. I will make sure to come back on my next trip!"}
{"text":"We asked for the USB port and the bar tender said no.  One white chick walk up and they found a USB.   Be careful with this location as me and my gf are interracial and will not come back. He would not serve us what the whites were having even tho they were our friends.  He asked them if it is okay to serve the black."}
{"text":"I felt compelled now to write and talk about the service we experience each time we drop in for either a wine tasting or birthday gathering. We first came to learn about the location from a Facebook posting about a wine tasting.  We were celebrating my wife's Birthday week and wanted to stop in for a few drinks.  We were immediately greeted with warm smiles and comfort from the d√©cor / seating arrangements.  The wait staff was amazingly friendly, attentive, and graciously passionate about what they do.  Our servers (yes) servers were so descriptive about the Meat and Chesses plates we were hypnotized into ordering both trying almost everything on the menu.  You have to try the kebabs and Chef's platter.  Heck get them both, you can't lose anytime they have real Honey Comb, Goat Cheese, and duck breast you know you are in for a treat. The presentation was awesome and high-end put together.  The way it was presented and the service alone I would defiantly be willing to pay twice what we were charged.  This wine nook is a true Charlotte hidden gem in the Queen City no snobs just great folks and good food and wine.  This is a location where you feel like home with family.   We have now visited the 5th street location in Charlotte 3 times now including the visit last night to sample the South African wines offered for my Birthday.  The wine seller was very articulate, polite, and enjoyable to hear him speak about the history of the wines from last night.  The service yet again was over the top impressive, everyone attentive to your needs and descriptive about all of the menu items.  To be honest we travel extensively as Foodies and this is the BEST SERVICE we have experienced at any establishment in the Carolinas.  My wife and I come from F&B backgrounds and see how places fall short of either Food Quality or understand the Customer Experience, front and back of the house.  This places is the bar with those standards, as yes I even checked the immaculate restrooms.   Uptown....skip the lines, sorry service and try a good spot you will return to."}
{"text":"I wish I had taken a picture of the birkdale salad but I was too hungry. It was SO good. Great presentation. Perfect balance. Some of the best goat cheese I've ever had. I came on Saint Patrick's day so it was quiet due to the other things happening in town but this is what I wanted. Super friendly staff. Overall a wonderful experience. I don't think you can go wrong with the menu!"}
{"text":"While we were in Charlotte we made it a mission to try one of the wine bars close to downtown. After checking out Yelp to see what was in the area we decided to check out Corkscrew on 5th.   We arrived pretty early in the day on a Friday, around 5:30, so it was pretty slow. We had first choice where to sit so we chose by the window with beautiful red chairs. The place was decorated really nicely and I loved the wine bottle display on the wall by the seating area.   The owner greeted us with menus and as we looked it over she brought us over some waters. They have a great selection of cheese and meats that are reasonably priced. We made our decision on two meats and two cheeses.   The platter was beautifully presented with the perfect accompaniments of olives, pickles, honey, and crackers served along side. The wine selection is great as well. Many different types of wines that will satisfy anyone's taste.   Overall, it was a great experience at Corkscrew on 5th and if you ever find yourself in the area I'd highly recommend stopping by."}
{"text":"Service has been slow. Most recent visit we ended up leaving due to being unable to find a cashier."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorites spots to go!! The service is always great and the food is amazing. The atmosphere always gives a good feel and they're always specials. The pimento bacon and cheese sandwich is usually my go-to choice for food."}
{"text":"This location is a weekly staple for my boyfriend and I. They have awesome food and drink specials every day. I've tried a lot of items on the menu and the charcuterie set up is one of the best in Uptown. I really like that they have a huge selection of different wine and beer. Recently I hosted a large event here and everyone was so impressed! I'm looking forward to using Corkscrew for future events. The atmosphere and staff really set this place a part from other wine bars in the area."}
{"text":"Great wine se til with pricing for everyone.  Charcuterie plate a great value.  Highly recommend stopping in. Great interior relaxing place to share a bottle"}
{"text":"Waiting in line right now. There's on barista, 5-6 of us waiting, and a multitude of voices behind the counter out of sight that could be helping him. If I didn't live at the Vue and desperately needed coffee right now I wouldn't waste my time. Cool music and artsy decor doesn't make up for crap service and mediocre coffee.  Update: came here again, this time was served promptly and the barista working was very nice. There wasn't anyone else there at the same time as me, but still, got a coffee and a bagel in no time and great way to start the weekend."}
{"text":"Nice spot to go to on a week night. It's low key and not over the top. Good wine and great food with no crowd loud music or extra flashiness. Came in immediately was greeted. Sat at the bar and was given menus and description of all the wine I tasted. The wine was great!!!! During the tasting on Thursday you get 4 wines. They change your glass with each wine you taste. They make recommendations for pairing with food. We had the flatbread 3rd ward as an app paired very well with the Chardonnay. The 4 cheese grilled cheese was mouth watering delicious.  I will definitely return on a week night. I think it's a nice place to go on a date, just to relax, catch up with friends, after work etc."}

Convenient second fact:  Corkscrew On 5th offers hand-crafted espressos, 42 wines by the glass, 389 wines by the bottle, 30 beers on rotation. Selected seasonally, so pick and choose.

{"text":"Finally had a chance to visit this hidden gem. The staff was very knowledgeable about the menu. I tried the Portabella Mushroom Melt. I was very impressed. It had great flavor and the home chips complemented the sandwich. My friends also tried various dishes on the menu. Everyone was very pleased. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Corkscrew participated in the Friends of Forth Ward Garden Tour this past weekend so I had occasion to stop in again. The service was friendly and the atmosphere relaxed. They had a generous serving of hummus with lovely toasted pita. The pita was so flakey and delicious I begged them to find out from the kitchen what it was. Turns out they don't use the pita bread: they use the gyro bread. Genius!"}
{"text":"Great service and atmosphere. Wish there was a full kitchen. Staff fully makes up for that!"}
{"text":"This spot is definitely a must for a casual night out on the town. They have a nice wine selection and the  pricing is affordable.I enjoyed a wine flight and some salted caramel truffles which were delicious. The spot is intimate and cozy. I will definitely keep this place in mind in the future."}
{"text":"Loved this place and the environment. I would recommend ubering if possible but I believe there is a parking lot right up the street. We had a bottle of wine, the bruschetta, fries, and cheese platter. All the food was absolutely delicious and works well with the wine. The women at the bar were awesome and Elise was so sweet and welcome from walking in the door. We will be coming back again especially on Friday and Saturday nights for the bands and more wine! Definitely recommend and has that local Charlotte feel."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this little wine bar. On weekends they have live music. Cool little place for a cheese board and a couple glasses of wine before dinner. The staff is generally helpful and knows their product. Try the fries or any of the flatbreads I'd you deviate from the cheese and charcuterie boards"}
{"text":"Who knew the Corkscrew was a brunch spot, well not this guy but we'll definitely be back.   A few friends/couples invited us all to this cute spot for Sunday Funday brunch. Upon arrival, they have two sides which is actually one full restaurant with an inside divider but very well thought out basically wine on one side and food/bar on the other side but you can sit on either side.  With my teenaged neice/daughter visiting it was important that this place be kid friendly which it absolutely was. Our waiter made them feel very special and at ease with the eclectic menu and very attentive while we mingled. Based on their empty plates the food was great. They had the grilled cheese which came with various cheeses and the Steak Frites which they equally enjoyed.   I personally didn't eat but enjoyed the different champagnes that they offered for mimosas and with one waiter to nearly 16 people no one was overlooked nor ignored which was very impressive. Thank you Corkscrew for letting us rearrange your furniture to fit the group so we could all sit together as a group."}
{"text":"Loved the charcuterie board and bottomless mimosas!  A definite stop for a Sunday afternoon snack any week.  They had a really nice menu full of great choices for lunch on the Corkscrew side of the restaurant.  It was confusing as we walked into the coffee side and there was only coffee and breakfast sandwiches to choose from.  The staff seemed confused but the manager or bartender quickly stepped in and took us over to the restaurant side for mimosas and a much more robust menu.  Both the food and drinks were excellent."}
{"text":"The little coffeeshop that could....n't.    I found this place rather disappointing.  Closing at 3 o'clock during the week is the first fail.  The coffee was the second fail.  Options were minimal, and the drip coffee was not good.  Even the pastry case, if you can call it that, left a lot to be desired.  The decor is trying to compensate for what's lacking in other areas.  The hightop tables and red couches are inviting, but the place was empty.  Given that residents of The VUE, right next door, have their own in-house barista and coffee bar free of charge, Corkscrew is going to have to step up their game.  Honestly, I think they should stick to what they know best: wine."}
{"text":"Stopped by one Friday night with some friends. The parking situation is typical since it's uptown. You'll need to park in the lot across from Crave and walk or find street parking. They had live music and the atmosphere was great. Get the wine flight! You will not be disappointed. You can taste a little of everything and even share it if needed. I will be back."}
{"text":"So excited to have this great coffee shop in the Fourth Ward. The staff is excellent, the coffee delicious and, bonus, it turns into a wine bar in the evening!"}
{"text":"A handful of friends recommended Corkscrew. It took me awhile to make it but im glad i finally did.The inside decor is awesome here and perfect for the tone that is set in the inside.Its been said that anyone that says money cannot buy happiness has clearly never spent their money on wine and Charcuterie. One of the best boards i have tasted in Charlotte period hands down. Staff here was very accommodating, time got away from us here as we were laughing,eating, and having champagne and noticed we had been here for going on 4 hours, that's pretty major. Corkscrew is also perfect for date night as well."}
