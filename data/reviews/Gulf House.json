{"text":"My first and last visit here. Low quality food. Staffs are rude and certainly not helpful."}
{"text":"Great home made style Arabian cuisine. Remind me of the time I spend in Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf countries. They don't always have all the dishes on the menus so if you like to have something specific you might want to call in advance. Staffs are very nice and friendly."}
{"text":"I was told by my friends about the place and how great it was and what a great experience they had. So here is my review, The food reminds me of home!! Everything was fresh and good ! The food was hot and the chicken was fresh! What I had was Kabsa chicken (leg/thigh) with extra fried onions&raisons and it was really good! I also had kenafa and mint tea with rose water and it was just what I needed to end my meal ! The staff were nice and the management/owners were super friendly and nice! I loved this place! It surely reminds of home..
Excellent job! And I wish more success to the Resturant and to their owners !"}
