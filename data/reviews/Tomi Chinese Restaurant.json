{"text":"Great price, fantastic FRESHLY made food.  Best restaurant of its type in Charlotte"}
{"text":"This is a very unique experience for fans of Chinese food.  The dishes are very creative and they mix in flavors not normally found in traditional Chinese.  I had heard good things about this place so I decided to try it out for myself, and wow were they right.  The decor is very creative with great art work on the walls makes the whole place look spacious but cozy at the same time.   And the food is just so good.  The shrimp and scallops are great, the duck is probably the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"The best Chinese food I've had in years. It's a different style than I'm used to, being Taiwanese. It's much lighter with less oil and syrup than one would find in average Chinese American food I had spicy chicken with vegetables, and a very light fried rice with shrimp and chicken in a delicious brown sauce. The favors were fresh, it was spicy, but never overly sharp. The dish had a wonderful blend of flavors. My wife shared the rice and had shrimp with portobello mushrooms. She raved about it. I tasted it and the shrimp was tasty and the mushrooms were fresh and light. All in all, an excellent meal, an I will assuredly return!"}
{"text":"If I would have followed my GPS, I would have never made it here. It's on the corner of Rea Road and Colony in the shopping center. Parking can be a bit tight depending on when you go.  A cozy, yet spacious atmosphere was a good way to spend the dining experience. The server was friendly and was eager to describe any dish in question and even make it vegetarian, if requested.  I got the Tomi scallops with a little spice added. It looked and reminded me more of sweet and sour sauce with scallops over rice. It was flavorful. I enjoyed soaking my rice with the blazing red sauce. They are more than happy to refill your rice if you run out.  Like Bill F., I too was surprised at the moderate pricing. You did not get soup with the entree (all the other restaurants have spoiled me); however, you do get a good portion size.   Friendly service, good portion size...it's A-OK in my book!"}
{"text":"CLOSED DOWN ------------------------- Once again I wasted 45 minutes driving there and searching all around the shopping center only to find out this  *top rated* restaurant has been closed for 6 month.   Thanks for nothing folks"}
{"text":"Fancy-ish Chinese restaurants don't make sense to me (I hate PF Changs), but despite the modern decor and atmosphere, I enjoyed this place. The service was terrific, server/cook/owner dude even pulled out our chairs for us (maybe just the ladies), and water was always filled.   Veggie Tempura appetizer was good, but not what I was expecting. They'll make any dish veg friendly if you ask for it, so I got the Taiwanese style Tofu (originally chicken) and it was very flavorful, though I don't think it qualifies as Taiwanese. Got to try the Blackish tofu, extra spicy, and that was super yummy, my mouth was tingling for a good 10 minutes after.   Also, as a side note for those missing Taiwanese food, the owner offered to make me a more authentic dish, so I ordered a shrimp omelette (xia zai jian) and it was pretty dang good. Super nice guy from Monterey Park (orig from TW), he was very accommodating.   It's pricey for Chinese food, and portions aren't gargantuan. I don't know if I'm down to pay $20 for an entree and app incl tax+tip for Chinese food, not often anyway. But, def one of the best Chinese restaurants I've been to in my time here in Charlotte, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"My client told me that he was taking me to the best Chinese restaurant in town today and it was Tomi. My expectation was raised.  When we got there, my client asked the waiter (owner's son?) what Today's Special was. He said in a quiet voice, \"Spicy Lo Mein\" explaining some of the ingredients.  We all decided to try that, so we ordered 3 of them. It was actually not spicy unless i added the separately served spice into the noodle. I really liked the taste of it. Tasted somewhat familiar to me, but tasted nothing like the Lo Mein that we usually come across at Chinese restaurants in the U.S.  The service was pretty good too. When I coughed suddenly when the tea went into the wrong place in my throat, the waiter heard it and immediately brought me a glass of water. Nice touch.  I can't really judge the restaurant only by eating the Lo Mein but so far so good. I just have to try more dishes of Tomi and update my review later."}
{"text":"Some of the best Chinese food I've ever had!  The ginger beef was DIVINE!!!  I am so sad that this restaurant has closed.  It was my favorite Chinese restauraant anywhere!"}
{"text":"Was it the stinky, dimly lit Taiwanese place we were looking for?  Nope.  Was it surprisingly elegant, well staffed, and one of the better Chinese meals I've had out since moving to Charlotte?  Ya!  At first glance, the menu looks un-friendly to us veggies, but that is not the case. Any prep that can be done with tofu is available (and this is almost all of them). My Blackish Tofu (beef, on the menu) was good - oily prep, lots of dried red pepper flakes, some mushrooms and carrots thrown into the mix (plus bamboo shoots, odd). Tasty. Veg Tempura is not what we were expecting - somewhere between a pakora and..well...something, it was good, if a smallish serving for $6.  If you come here knowing what you want, how to pronounce it in Mandarin, and they have the stuff in the kitchen to accommodate ya, they will - a table pal had what looked like a glutinous-rice omelette, shrimpys abounding. Neat. Makes me want to learn a second language."}
