{"text":"Need to come back to give it five stars!  Great service with attentive staff.  Sat outside with a few flies but not bad.  Inside looked great and outside was perfect for having grandkids with us.  All of our dishes were well received: hash, breakfast chimi, hamburger and baked cauliflower.  I don't like cauliflower much but this was delicious.  Baked with lemon and still crisp it's a must try.  Burger was good, fries better.  Pancakes weren't bad.  Toasted brioche was good but could use a second egg. Prices were acceptable with a bottomless mimosa for 18 bucks. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Food and atmosphere here is amazing. I've been twice and everything I've ordered and friends have ordered has been across the board delicious. Service could be improved but not a major issue. Called about happy hour today. They only offer 1 drink for $5 from 4:30-5:30 PM during the week. That's their happy hour. This place probably would have gotten 5 stars from me if they offered a normal happy hour and I probably would be coming in more often. Too bad."}
{"text":"Super excited by this restaurant, even better that it's literally a 2 minute walk for me.  Food was great, breakfast burrito was good and flavorful.  The environment is spot on, but they could use some outdoor TV's, which would make it a great spot to watch Sunday football.    Looking forward to many visits in the future to try all they have to offer.  One downside, and I totally agree with other reviews, is their drinks.  Even the orange juice was watered down, tasted more like a powdered orange drink rather than \"freshly squeezed\".  Also was shocked to order a simple Patron margarita on the rocks and then to receive a $23 bill for it.  WTF?!?!?  Do they think they are in Manhattan instead of Phoenix?"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday around 5. Had beet salad which was delicious....the strawberry balsamic plate equally delicious and salmon plate.  Couldn't order off dinner menu til 530 and server took another tables order before ours even though they were seated after us.  That's why only 4 stars.  The pairings on the plates were very tasty!!!!  Too full for dinner :-("}
{"text":"Stopped by last night for dinner this was my first time. The waiter, Eli was so helpful. He knew it was our first time and took such care in his service to us we will definitely be returning. He recommended the Lumache pasta, two thumbs up! Also had cherry tart for desert, the flavors in my mouth were amazing.  I can't wait to return.  The atmosphere was so beautiful. I'll definitely be having my birthday dinner here!"}
{"text":"This is place is such a great addition to the neighborhood! We had a fantastic meal and the service was top notch. Macallister was our server and he was very attentive and informative. Don't miss out on the casarecce pasta! It was delicious! We will be visiting this gem frequently!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here with my husband. The food was delicious and the atmosphere was fun. We ate outside on the patio on a chilly day. The staff was very accommodating with the heaters. I had the smoked brisket chili and was very impressed...it was served in ceramic/clay type pot and definitely held its temperature! My husband ordered the mole chicken salad and loved it! We saw a few tables order the roasted cauliflower...that will be a must the next time we stop in!!!"}
{"text":"Noisy beyond belief and apparently designed for high turnover.  Went on a Thursday night at the behest of trendy foodie friends.  The excuse for the noise level -which was off the charts- you literally had to scream to be heard by the person across the table from you- was that two large parties had booked the patio but didn't like the heat so they had to be relocated indoors.  Um...it's Phoenix, people.  In June.  Really?   Both the banquette and chair seats were less than comfortable even for small, trim people and after the \"large parties\" left, the noise level was still very high thanks to concrete floors, high ceilings with inadequate acoustic baffling and vast expanses of bare walls and glass.  I sensed a need for turnover...lots of turnover.  Food was pretty good for Phoenix - nouvelle American but a bit trite.  I've had much better; Cibo comes to mind.  Actually, what I get at home comes to mind.  And my ears aren't ringing for an hour afterward!"}
{"text":"Tried Ocotillo after hearing so many great things about it and what I was hearing was accurate. Great environment with awesome service and the food was amazing. The flavors were incredible. We did a bunch of small plates for a group of 4 and were definitely satisfied."}
{"text":"I watched this place slowly come to life through its construction to opening.   Never a bad meal.  We moved to Washington State, but still stop in to see GM David Johnson when in town.  Hadn't seen my brother in a couple of years and he was in town for work.  We met at Ocotillo for dinner.  Great food again. My brother remarked multiple times about the thought that went into the design of the place.  I was bummed that drink \"Number Four\" had been rotated off of the menu, but there was still the usual great list to choose from.  Another wonderful night at Ocotillo."}
{"text":"Amazing quality food and drink! Enjoyed dinner and then breakfast here - can't go wrong. Highly recommend their cauliflower dish and cocktails."}
{"text":"The food was fabulous and the atmosphere is great! We shared small plates and vegetables during happy hour. Presentation was beautiful!"}
{"text":"Amazing speciality cocktails!!! I had the whiskey drink with machta in it. The vibes is great with tons of outdoor seating. The brunch on Sundays has a DJ at it. Food is good especially the salad with carrots in it and the brussel sprouts appetizer. Very kind staff."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere. Outside area is amazing and great for parties. Try the mole ribs - falls off the bone and big portions."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal. I was skeptical, but it did not disappoint. The food was unique and well executed. Service was friendly and more than adequate. The design is gorgeous and the architecture sublime. Can't wait to come back and try more cuisine.  We had small plates that were all exceptional. With all the many restaurants opening now, this one has that special something. Congrats ocotillo, you're exceptional. Can't wait to come back :))"}
{"text":"Food was absolutely amazing.  Firs walked up to separate coffee bar area with outside bar stool seating.  Then to the left lounge outside couches and a couple there with their beautiful Great Dane.  Inside cute bar area to the left and nice cozy dining to the right.  Music was coming from a stand in front spinning vinyl :) Awesome!    Started with the avocado toast, delicious.  Then I ordered the arugula salad with chilled melon and burrata.  Probably my new favorite salad.  I generally do not like cantaloupe or melon but they sliced this do thin and the dressing with all if it together paired perfectly. My significant other ordered the chicken egg white  burrito and loved it. It was loaded and tasty. Will be back again soon for sure"}
{"text":"Fab food , service could be better , I presume working out the kinks , Ill be back ."}
{"text":"This is a hip and trendy place that has a nice atmosphere. We sat in the dining room which was so loud that it was hard to hold a conversation. While it was a busy time of the evening, it just seems like they should do something about  absorbing some of the noise although, due to the layout, I am not cetain how this could be accomplished.  Linda was our server. She was sweet and always had a smile. Made us feel real comfortable but she seemed like she had so many tables to wait on that we didn't see her that often. She was attentive when she was there so nothing bad could be said about her. As for the food service, it seemed like we were waiting a long time just to place out initial order. Once it was placed the food took some time to get to the table. That being said, it was the busy time of dinner which could be the reason for this.  The food had some interesting combinations which piqued our interest right away. I ordered the Peking Duck with palenta. The palenta was creamy and delicious but the duck was dry. Now normally duck can dry out quickly but this was dry to the point of being tough. With what they charge for the duck the kitchen should have taken more time to ensure it was cooked correctly. My partner ordered the ribeye steak which he stated lacked flavor. He actually made the comment that the flatiron steak at Southern Rail had more flavor. That is like comparing apples and oranges when talking about cuts of beef, but that was his opinion. He thinks the price was also high for the quality of the food. As an appetizer we shared the Ricotta plate. This was incredibly flavorful and I would deintely recommend it. For dessert our server suggested the Trifle. This was a flavorful way to end dinner.  We have wanted to try this place out since we saw it open. Unfortunately neither of us were impressed with the food and the high price just made it that much worse."}
{"text":"Overall the food was pretty great, and the vibe is nice. Had brunch and want to come back again when it's not so busy."}
{"text":"I love this place!! The food is different, delicious, atmosphere is great! Four of us tried a variety of specialty drinks, 3 appetizers, dinner menu AND desserts too! I can't even pick one favorite cause everything was great. Maybe I liked the cauliflower appetizer the most. I want to go back here, enjoy the outdoor patio, they also have a fire pit surrounded by couches."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a quick lunch on their airy outdoor patio.  Interesting concept with multiple indoor and outdoor seating areas.  Wonderful and efficient service with knowledgeable staff.  We had a hard time deciding what to eat after perusing their menu full of locally sourced and creative dishes.  We ended up sharing the fattoush salad and roasted whole chicken wings - which ended up being plenty for two.  The fattoush salad was wonderfully refreshing and unique.  The chicken wings had a bit of heat and the meat was quite tender.  Would've loved to try dessert or their coffee bar located next to the patio if we had more time.  Truly an inspired menu - would love to try some of their other dishes another time."}
{"text":"I have to admit it takes a lot to compel me to write a review but this experience was honestly beyond my wildest expectations. We came here on a whim and from the moment we walked in the door we were beyond impressed. My boyfriend's a chef and it's so hard/annoying to find a place that's up to his standards but he talked about this place for hours after we left. Our server Ryan was seriously one of the most knowledgable, outgoing (without being obnoxious like TGIFridays Flair style), cool guys we could have asked for. Every one of his suggestions from appetizers to wine was perfect. This night was like a five star fine dining experience that happened from stumbling into a restaurant that looked cool and busy from the outside. I can't recommend this restaurant and Ryan enough. So perfect!!!"}
{"text":"It pains me to report that this was one of the WORST dining experiences I have ever had, like EVER! We were a large, but easy, group gathering for a birthday party on Saturday night. The restaurant was a friends choice and upon walking in, we were all so excited with the selection and couldn't wait to see the rest of the space ect... Sat at one table, ordered a few drinks and quickly moved to another table to accommodate our group--- DOWNHILL from there! The poor waitress was completely overwhelmed and dropped the ball right from the start. Ordered drinks, then some apps,  and 30+ min later drinks hadn't arrived! Servers placed the few plates that came out at uneven times at the end of the table and we had to get up and give one another our food, still no drinks mind you. 6 people ordered the whole fish and 15 min she came back to let us know it had run out 2 hrs earlier. Then an hour and half into our experience, she remembered to ask the rest of the table for our order! We asked for more help for the table and the additional hands were accompanied by an abrasive manager who made us feel like we were the ones inconveniencing the server by moving our seats around?? Which we never did! Oh the drinks had yet to arrive! Final straw--- I ask the poor server where my meal was and she stops, stares, and replies that she forgot to place the order and the kitchen was now closed-- then cries.  It was terrible, No cheese requests can with cheese, more wine came as a beer, and then no dinner for me and my sister. I finally got up and spoke to the manager, David Johnson, who proceeded to unprofessionally told me that the waitress would loose her job(completely inappropriate and unprofessional of him to say) and that he would do what managers do to fix our bill.   He pick and chose what to take off, which was so lame, as we were never there for a free ride, just extremely disappointed by everything operational having to do with this place. One server brought us, a table of 20, two complimentary jars of dessert. I feel really bad that something with so much potential and great food wouldn't thrive due to their poor poor management."}
{"text":"Great ambience and well designed restaurant. The Salmon ceviche and other small plates are almost a full meal. Great value for money. Good selection of Beers."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried Ocotillo last night for the first time, for our anniversary.  Fun place, very friendly and nice staff, and a beautiful kitty lounging outside to greet us!  The polenta-crusted eggplant was amazing!  The crunch of the polenta was so satisfying with the soft eggplant, and nice salad with it (with some very hot peppers, whew!).  The reason I'm only giving 4 stars is because the duck confit raviolis were...okay.  I was not in love with them, though I did like the peaches and cherries in the dish.  My husband's beef ribs were outstanding (you bet I tried them!) and came right off the bone.  The french fries were good, but we don't much like cilantro (each to pick off at least), and no real taste of lime.  So a good french fry, but still just a french fry.  We took dessert home and it really didn't survive that well, so eat dessert there if you have room left!  I'm sure we'll be back to try some other goodies--it was so hard to decide what to try!"}
{"text":"Cool set up concept is there service not up to par. I'd go again for a better experience."}
{"text":"I want to thank the GM David Johnson for the outstanding customer service last night.  Unfortunately something happened with our dinner ticket that caused a delay in service, he came by and told us he is comping the entire bill.  Not a few drinks, not an appetizer or dessert, but the entire check.    We'll be back, not only because of his service, but the food and drinks were terrific.  The property itself is laid out really cool as well with an outdoor bar and communal areas surrounding the restaurant."}
{"text":"Great place! Love the atmosphere and the staff is always friendly! The food is also amaze balls! Breakfast chimichanga for life!"}
{"text":"I couldn't quite figure out what this lot used to be in a past life but it's a cool place with a unique set of buildings.  The buildings here sort of form a neat little courtyard walkway area that you can walk through or host events at while walking towards the main dining room/bar area.  The roasted cauliflower was the best thing of the night hands down - never thought I'd say that at a restaurant but it was damn good.  The Beef Ribs were massive!  Honestly, it was almost too much Meat and too rich, again never thought I'd say that but still worth it to keep my gluttony game fresh. I wish they'd let you substitute out the french fries though on the dishes because that was a little much with the Beef Ribs, it needed some sort of lighter veggie or salad or something.  This place would definitely make a good date night with the unique hip vibe, couple glasses of wine, and a few small plates."}
{"text":"Incredible restaurant with quality food and service. It is gem in central Phoenix that we need. Nothing gets brought to the table that isn't less than satisfactory. The food is fresh, tasteful, and each dish has obviously been very thought out and original. Not to mention their extensive drink menu that is delightful. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We arrived a little early for dinner so it was appetizer time for the  party of five we split the wings, goat cheese, pork steak. and roasted cauliflower. All were excellent. For mains three had pasta, I had the beef ribs, yabba dabba doo on the ribs. 5 th person to full so shared and everybody's, everyone thought they had best dish. We will be back."}
{"text":"Super busy on Sunday.  Told 30-45 min wait so we grabbed a bar spot.  Lots of tables though so I'm not sure if that was accurate.  Service at the bar was friendly and quick.  Food was large portions but tasty.  I had the skillet pancake (for like three people) and she had the brisket.  The pancake was huge and thick.  A pretty unique rendition but flavour was light and fluffy.  They also have buckwheat pancakes that makes this place a bit unique.  The brisket was cooked perfectly and very tender.  The location was hip with nice indoor and outdoor seating but extremely loud inside due to poor acoustic design that so many of these \"industrial\" designs suffer from.  Overall a positive experience.  Expect brunch weekends to be packed and loud.  Lots of the seating is communal as well if that matter to you."}
{"text":"I had an amazing experience here, Ryan was a great server. I had a lot of questions and he guided me threw the menu. I got the roasted cauliflower and veggie cassolet. Being a meat eater they were fantastic!!!!! Must go! Ask for Ryan!"}
{"text":"Attended my grand daughter's wedding held at Ocotillo yesterday. What a great venue!   Outside, grass, lighted trees, couches, fire pit and THE best food I have had in a long time. My rib eye was probably the best I have ever had. The hors douerves  were fabulous.  All in all it was a perfect venue and a perfect day!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Cute, classy and plenty of room for big parties or bar seating for one!  Cons: bring a magnifiing glass to read the menu.  I'm not that old and the print was wayyyyyy too tiny!   Almost too big, too spread out.   But the space also can be nice so you don't have to be drowned out by other's conversations. Took a group of friends here and everyone loved it!    One of the owners was in the first time I visited.  He is quite the wine affecianoto. It was great to chat with him, he's a cool guy!   Go here!"}
{"text":"Through a recommendation from a friend, I decided to take my wife to Ocotillo. It was a wonderful experience from start to finish. There are so many selections for dinner like ribs, chicken, fish, and house made pastas. I got the ribs and the cilantro lime fries. I was very impressed. The espresso mole sauce was excellent and the beef was so tender. It came right off the bone. I had questions about the wine menu, and the GM David gave me great recommendations for a red wine. Overall it hit all five stars."}
{"text":"The salads alone will bring me back, but sadly this spot is not kid friendly even for my little foodie.  Most of the menu is spicy, and when I ordered the salad without dressing, it came doused anyway.  The ribs were tender, a little over charred but serviceable.  Not sure that we'll be back in the summer - but the outdoor dining looks inviting for fall.  Wish the menu had less spicy options for my little foodie.  She is a well behaved adventurous diner, but we felt out of place here.  We don't do kid menus, and the team seemed non-plused to point out the few dishes that had no heat.  Surely this can't only be a child's preference?"}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant downtown.  The food and service were wonderful. Make sure and order a Variety of the small plates. So fun to share"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, friendly service.  I had the brisket and polenta and it was knock out!!!"}
{"text":"A group of us came in for cocktails+lunch and couldn't have been more pleased. Everything from the look of the space to the hospitality of the staff was five stars. The menu is well thought out and completely delivered, especially for the price point. Geoffrey Wilson, the best bartenders in the valley (hands down) has made his home here at Ocotillo and just for the sake of enjoying his sazeracs and company, I'll be back. Cheers, Ocotillo! It was our pleasure! Can't wait for next time."}
{"text":"Cool, casual, urban atmosphere. Great service from friendly staff.  I don't know who buys their wine,  but it was SO good and not one I was familiar.  The absolute BEST was the Ocotillo chicken! It was seasoned top perfection and juicy throughout! Will definitely be back!  YUM!"}
{"text":"Read about Ocotillo in both Edible and Phoenix magazines. Visited over the weekend for dinner and they did not disappoint! Fresh, creative food coming out of the kitchen, but even more impressive was the staff, from hostess to server(Eli) to Chef Walter, who all made us feel like kings (and queens). Thanks for a great experience! We'll be back."}
{"text":"Tried the smoke salmon salad and the poached pear on the Brunch Menu. Both were incredible! I can't wait to go back. Such unique flavors and the atmosphere is perfect!"}
{"text":"Great potential but it can use some improvements.  I went for a late lunch, so it was not very crowded, but the food took forever to arrive, even though I ordered something directly from the lunch menu with no modifications. Given the time of the day, this was not something I expected, so I didn't time it or anything, but it felt like half an hour. While waiting, I responded to some emails and got through a big chunk of a New Yorker article (their articles are long, in case you don't already know).  The service was good, but felt awkward: visibly counting with a finger to make sure they were certain of the table number before taking an order, that sort of thing. All of the servers in my section looked very focused and nervous, like they're terrified of making a mistake or something. As they gain more experience, hopefully they will start to relax, or at least learn to hide their anxiety, so the guests can relax.  Another item that may be considered minor or major, depending on who you are, is the shiny table top with all the puddles from the water glasses. No tablecloth, no menu-as-placemat, no coaster, no cocktail napkin, none of that - just one not-so-absorbent large napkin you are supposed to use to wipe your mouth, and I am not the type to multipurpose a napkin. So the puddles remained through the whole meal, which I'm sure is not something the architect or interior designer of this very modern and polished space approves of.   If I were rating on food alone I would give it a 5 (for the Mediterranean Chicken). My overall raring for this one visit is really more like 3.5. The graphic flavor chart for the wine list is interesting but not very useful when it's printed on the back of the list. (Which reminds me of another thing: somebody needs to work on the design of the menu. The font for the wine flavor chart is huge, while the food menu is packed in with tiny font; neither are easy to read.) Would like to go back in a few months after they have a chance to work out some kinks."}
{"text":"This place is heaven. I came with a date, and we shared an appetizer, two vegetables, and a pasta and had a feast. They hand make the pasta and so many other items on the menu. The wine selection is huge, and they have a fun wine legend to help you pick a wine. The cocktail menu looked amazing as well. It was pretty packed when we got there, but our waiter was still very attentive and quick to get us whatever we needed. We would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"My husband and I live and work in the central Phoeenix area, and Ocotillo is a welcome addition to our local scene. We stop by the O-Togo coffee bar for espresso fizz and fresh baked scones at least once a week. Service is spectacular and the coffee is amazing! The main restaurant is beautiful inside, with a stunning marble bar and lots of windows for light. Recently I tried the pork steak on the \"small plates\" and was pleasantly surprised. The meat was tender and juicy but the flavors were fresh and bright. I could eat this everyday!! Paired the pork with a glass of the red sangria, heavenly! My husband loves the house made pastas, his favorite is the creste de Gallo. The outside patio is spectacular for a nice date night with beautiful lighting and cooler to make the Phoenix nights more enjoyable.  Five stars for food, service, and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Ocotillo! The cauliflower was out of this world and I'd go back just for that.  Love the architecture and beautiful outside spaces, among the prettiest in town without all of the congestion of some of the places with yard games on the patio.  The only drawback is that I look at China Chili across the street and want a peking duck to go with my drink."}
{"text":"Place is really cute. Has a large outdoor space that is nice to sit out on. The food is pretty good, I had 2 egg breakfast that came with coffee, which was hands down my favorite thing. The Bloody Mary I had was kinda bland. It came with horseradish which I didn't really care for and probably won't get it again, but I would come back to try something else on the brunch menu!"}
{"text":"Incredible. Sat outside in the beer garden with family and friends to celebrate my birthday. The drinks were creative and crafty while our server was so sweet. She was attentive with great energy and very knowledgeable on the wine list and menu items. Most things are organic and the menu is constantly changing to accommodate seasonal ingredients. We definitely over ordered as the portions could feed a small army. A few memorable items included the chicken meatballs, ribs and pork chops. They served me some kind of banana cream cupcake combination that was mouth watering goodness. This place is a must whether you're a foodie or someone in need of a good ass meal."}
{"text":"Never again will I visit this place...2.5 hours to receive our food.  Our waiter needs to find a new profession.  Maybe something a bit slower in pace for the confused Gent.  How about something in Government?"}
{"text":"Great vibe, cool set up with the coffee bar, and solid menu. Was there twice this past week and once prior. typically order 3 plates each time for the table and everything I've ever ordered has been spot on. Will continue to dine there."}
{"text":"I went with a group of four people and three of us had never been before so we were all looking forward to it.  Its a very cool space and a great atmosphere but a little loud for trying to have conversation.    All of us enjoyed our food but my pasta dish was a little spicy for my liking.  I saw it had chili flakes in it but I didn't think to ask how spicy it was so that was my own fault.  I still ate it and enjoyed, just burned my mouth.  We ordered a single desert to share (watching our figures) and the person brought it to us brought out the wrong desert.  We asked him if it was the desert we ordered and he said yes.  When our waiter came back we asked him and he said, no you got something else.  He offered to take it off the bill for us and that was very nice of him.    Overall a pleasant experience and we all agreed we would go back again.  Its more of a place to go for the experience than the food I would say though."}
{"text":"Excellent food in a most welcoming environment!!! Been there just once (opened less than 1 week ago) but headed for my first brunch now. A spot to become a regular."}
{"text":"OHH MYYYY GAWWWWW - I might be in love. When Gallo Blanco moved out of the Claredon, my heart broke a little as flavor left downtown. Ocotillo filled that empty spot and I have no doubt that I will visit their establishment with a frequency that might border on stalking. The space is amazing, the food (I ordered the Thai Chicken) was an explosion of flavor. I can't wait to do Happy Hour as the drink menu looked great. All in all, I pondered giving a 1 star review just so I can keep the goodness of this place all to myself. But alas, that wouldn't be fair. So, do it - go there and bask in the glory of flavor."}
{"text":"I just had a great lunch, spicy sausage sandwich  that went great with this crazy good beer called Cerveza 159!!!"}
{"text":"Interesting menu with variation and depth. Food took forever and I ultimately wasn't super impressed. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"One of my faves in PHX. Love the Ocotillo chicken, service is always on point and the wine is delicious. Love coming here whenever I can make it over that way."}
{"text":"I tried to like it, but the food falls very short. Nothing tastes fresh and everything is way overpriced.   Let me first start by saying that I work nearby and we were really excited for a new place to eat. I have been to Ocotillo 5 times now and each time has been progressively worse. Four of my visits were for lunch and one was an attempt at a happy hour. I say attempt because they have no happy hour, at all. We left for another place in the area after we had already ordered a drink and told they were closing soon. The servers don't know anything about the alcohol being offered, it's clear that there is no training or knowledge being given to them. They have also been out of most of their wine offerings the two times that I've tried to order.   Walking in, the first thing you will notice is that it's very, very noisy. They keep the music really loud and all of the hard surfaces cause voices to echo and reverb over your conversation. Don't expect to have a decent conversation or even hear your server unless you sit outside.   The roasted cauliflower was OK, but it would be hard to ruin such a simple dish.  The diver scallop ceviche tasted terrible. The scallops were chewy and I was pretty sure it was several days old.  The mole chicken salad comes with chicken nuggets covered in a flavorless brown sauce that almost resembles chocolate and for a \"field greens\" salad, it was 90% shredded cabbage.  The country pate is on par with Spam. It's dry, flavorless and sliced out. It was impossible to spread on the provided oversized bread that was better suited for bruschetta. For $14, I expected more than just a plate of a bunch of pickled greens and spam.  The smoked salmon sandwich tasted like it's been sitting in the fridge for a week.  The BBQ pork sausage sandwich came with raw sliced jalapeño which made it totally inedible The brisket sandwich some how made it past expedition burnt and what little meat it had was mostly fatty. The caramelized onions and red peppers tasted like they came from a can.  The \"crispy tofu\"  Bahn MI was awful. The tofu was over cooked and had no flavor.  The Thai chicken dinner was incredibly salty, I'm pretty sure it had been sitting for days to have soaked up that much sodium. The pure salt content over powered any other flavor they had tried to include.   Now every restaurant has its issues, but each of these visits is over a span of several months. They are well passed the opening jitters. The place is trying to be trendy and hip, but it fails on even the basics. All of the faults appear to be from poor management and bad kitchen practices. It's a shame."}
{"text":"The food here is exceptional. It's priced accordingly. We have been here for brunch several times and dinner twice. There isn't salt and pepper on the table because you don't need it, the food is perfection!   The atmosphere is clean and professional. There is a dj playing normally. Great spot for a date or work happy hour!"}
{"text":"Food was good but service was HORRIBLE!!! A group of us sat outside and it was a waiting game from beginning to end. The worst it's after they gave us the bill and they never came back to pick it up. We could have just left and no-one would have noticed. I asked for somebody twice. The second time the receptionist argued with me. She told me to go to the bar to settle our bill"}
{"text":"The place is beautiful but They need more options on the menu especially deserts. The food is ok but not good enough for me to keep coming back."}
{"text":"Won't be returning.  Booked a party of 30, all with disposable income, most of whom had not eaten at Ocotillo before, for my husband's 50th.  Event manager Steve was condescending from the time I made the reservation, six weeks ahead.  In every interaction he made it clear that I was lucky he was letting me and my friends dine at \"his\" restaurant.    Ocotillo has lovely ramada seating for 30 - perfect for our party - but Steve wanted an additional $200 charge for the \"privilege\" of picking where we wanted to be seated.  he also asked for an additional $200 for separate checks.  I know that's a lot of separate checks, and they are a hassle, but $200???  It's not like this place has a Michelin star.  Our server, MacAllistair, did his best, however assigning a single server to a party of 30 was another signal of how little our patronage was valued.  I never, ever expect to have my butt kissed at any establishment, but I expect that when I am bringing 30 people to your restaurant, you will at least make me feel appreciated, and not like I am a bother, which is the way Ocotillo treated me."}
{"text":"This place is one of my recent finds. I love their ocotillo chicken and all of their salads. You cannot go wrong with their salads. They have nice wine selection. I like their coffee shop that opens at 6 am and closes at 2 pm. This place has a nice vibe.  Only down side is... they need some kind of sound proofing. It gets really noisy in there."}
{"text":"Make sure you don't sit by the fire pit we sat for 20 minutes without any service. The waiter said the cut off to get sevice is the last picnic table . If you are a customer it shouldn't matter where you are to get good service"}
{"text":"This place is great!  Food is great, drinks are on point and the wine list is exceptional!  The pitchers of Sangria are out of this world!!!"}
{"text":"A great time except for when two of my old coworkers told me about how they were broken up with. Whoops! Went great with the Cider. Eggs? Puffy. Lotta cabbage. I am NOT playing. I think you all will be happy about it except when they're trying to pawn a whole vat of Frosé on you. Come back on any other day."}
{"text":"Ocotillo is great!  Food was flavorful and unique with great presentation.  The property is very well designed with distinct spaces for dining indoors, dining outdoors, sipping in the beer garden, casual relaxation around a gas fire pit, kids lawn, or grabbing a coffee and pastry at the coffee bar \"O to go\".  We were a party of five for dinner with a reservation for 6:30pm on a Wednesday night and after dinner we had a brief tour from front of house Manager, David Johnson, and he told us about future plans for an outdoor trellis, which will create another fantastic outdoor space along Flower Street.  Highly recommend starting with vegetable small plates to share, we had the Roasted Cauliflower, Pecan Wood Smoked Beets, and King Trumpet Mushrooms; all very well prepared and unique.  The cauliflower had a wonderful evenly cooked light brown roast color that paired perfectly with the light pesto sauce and the beets were quite unique with a very light smoky flavor that paired nicely with the ricotta and tantalized the palate.  The mushrooms were very nice, recommend cutting up the egg to let the yolk and mix together with the salad and mushrooms.  Main courses arrived very timely after we finished our starters, not immediately, but just the right amount of time.  One couple shared the Crispy Whole Fish for two, which is fried whole with delicious flaky moist fish with crispy skin.  Two others in the party each had the Ocotillo Chicken, which was perfectly roasted and paired with an amazing potato salad; one of our party doesn't eat potato salad, but found this one to be perfect with the chicken.  I had the Mesquite Grilled Ribeye, which was perfectly cooked and a very nice cut of beef; great char on the outside with perfect temp on the inside - paired with roasted fingerling potatoes and mushrooms.  We finished with a shared dessert of a roasted granny smith apple with cinnamon ice cream and drizzled with caramel and pecans; a very nice balance of sweet & tart, crispy & creamy, and warm & cool.  Wait staff was very attentive and friendly.  My wife and I went back the next day to try the coffee bar.  Great Cafe Au Lait and Latte.  They had a blueberry scone, which was moist and delicious.  Nutella Croisant was great, but a little messy."}
{"text":"Great food!  Great service!  I sat in the bar area...restaurant was very busy on this weeknight.  Would recommend the brussel sprout small plate and the pork tenderloin entree."}
{"text":"It must have been decades in the making but it seems so effortless. The team at Ocotillo uses seemingly basic and uninteresting ingredients to create amazing dishes. It is a delightful surprise something like cucumber can be so complex. They really work miracles in the kitchen. I have never had anything but food that exceeded expectations here."}
{"text":"Waited for waitstaff to take our order for 20 minutes (and attempted to waive them down). Finally left when no one showed. Disappointing"}
{"text":"My husband and I attended a birthday dinner for a friend on Friday night. We had heard mixed reviews from friends about this place but thought we would give it a try when we received the invitation for dinner.  We had 3 tables reserved outside for a b-day event.  When we arrived at 6:30, we went inside to the bar to grab a drink before the festivities started.  We ordered 3 drinks ($34.00) and while we were waiting, a waiter comes in and asks us if we were with the large table outside, we said yes, and then he said you can just order your drinks from me I 'm the waiter.  We told him we had already ordered but we would order from him moving forward. Our waiter said \" fine you can just order your drinks in here all night\" and then he stormed off.  We were left there with our jaws hanging to the ground in disbelief of what we just witnessed.  Our host was required to pay $200 for the privilege of bringing 35 people for drinks and dinner at their establishment.    The food was OK but certainly not worth the prices.   The Ocotillo concept is good but the execution is very poor. We will not be coming back.  Updated post 4.30.16 After my post, the GM reached out to me to ask me who our server was, which I told him because I still had the receipt.  The GM reached out to me again saying that my post was inaccurate and mean.    Correction-I spoke with the host of our group, he told me the event manager required a $200 fee to hold the 3 tables outside, which was not a deposit but instead a non-refundable fee, our host refused to pay that.  Then our host asked for separate checks to make it easier on his guests and they wanted a $200 fee to process separate checks which our host also refused to pay.    Additionally, the food was not that great given the price.  The Casserolet's beans were undercooked, the Pork Shank had under-cooked onions in it.   There are far too many wonderful restaurants in the area to be doing business like this."}
{"text":"Stopped in for brunch and a cocktail today, and I am so happy that I did! Enjoyed absolutely perfect food- beets and baked egg whites, a perfect Bloody Mary, and the best service in town from Eli. We have had Eli as a server every time we have visited Ocotillo and he's our favorite. Super personable, outstanding service and great recommendations. Ocotillo has it all!"}
{"text":"Great food and ambience, especially when the weather is good and you can sit outside. One of my favorite spots in this area!"}
{"text":"This appetizer is to die for and get a side of Burrata cheese to add on the top!Ps Eli is the best waiter here..."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Went for the first time to have lunch and instantly loved the atmosphere. There is plenty of outdoor seating options and the inside is just as nice. We had the cauliflower as an appetizer and it was so flavorful! As an entree I had the salmon sandwich and it was good but nothing extraordinary. I did try my sister's crispy  tofu and I actually liked that dish better, it was very good! Where they fell short on was the service. It took us a while to get our drinks (2 glasses of wine and a beer). Other than that the place was great and I will definitely be returning soon!"}
{"text":"We are pretty particular about food and Ocotillo was amazing!  The menu caught my eye and the food was spectacular.  The pasta is made fresh daily and some of the best pasta I've had!  The roasted cauliflower was delicious and the Ocotillo Chicken was a fabulous flavor pairing!  We will definitely return for more fresh, innovative and delicious food!"}
{"text":"Service was very slow, and very rude. I ordered the ceviche, which was completely flavorless, and came with no chips(as one would expect). It was just bad. It was also way overpriced. Upsides: It looks very nice, ok beer selection."}
{"text":"Food and service were both incredible. I'm a vegetarian and they have plenty of options that are actually delicious. Been for brunch and dinner and both were fantastic. So happy to have a place like this so close to my house now."}
{"text":"We had an awesome lunch at ocotillo this week! We brought my parents who were visiting from out of town - they love trying new and inventive things, and ocotillo certainly delivered.   Our server Josh gave us the run down on the menu and recommended a few of the house favorites. From the small plates, we tried the hand pulled mozzarella, roasted cauliflower and the roasted beets.   The mozzarella was served with pickled carrots and a carrot top pesto that was refreshingly tangy and the spice paired so well with the coolness of the mozzarella. The pink peppercorns on top just added the perfect extra hint of salty heat for the dish.   The roasted cauliflower was the star of the meal, I think. The flavor they packed into the cauliflower was just nuts. It was like this peanut roasted balsamic sauce with fresh pesto and chili peppers - it was so, so good.   The roasted beets were great too! There were a multitude of different ones to try all on a bed of whipped herbed ricotta that was amazing.   I got the tofu bahn mi, mom got the Japanese fish and chips, dad got the smoked salmon salad and my husband got the Peruvian chicken. Everything looked delicious and tasted even better! I loved the peanut sauce on my sandwich, moms fish was perfectly lightly fried, dads salad was refreshing, and my husbands chicken just pushed the limits on spice to be interesting and tasty. I also have to mention their lemonade - the ginger, lemongrass and mint make it so refreshing and delicious on a warm day. I always get one to go.   We sat outside on the covered patio by the bar and loved it. Such a perfect way to enjoy the Phoenix spring. Definitely stop by for brunch, lunch or dinner!   Oh - I have to give a hat tip to their coffee bar too. They're serving up sightglass beans and creating delicious drinks (and it opens super early!). Worth stopping by and getting out of the car for a cup of coffee instead of driving by the closest Starbucks. Give it a try, especially if Liden is on the bar!"}
{"text":"This is the most unorganized staff of event planners. I tried to reserve tables for a LARGE number of people with no contract because everyone would be getting their own meal and when I tried to offer to pay to have some food/drink out of the table they were not very willing to work with me. After sending an email to see about pre-ordering some food...we did not hear back for 3 days until I called the restaurant. I spoke with the owner and he continued to tell me how busy they are and because I don't have a contract we are not their priority. Then the OWNER HUNG UP ON ME. Food is price and I will never be back to this restaurant and will let my network of people, I do events all the time, know NEVER to do events here or even go for lunch or dinner. I know I did not have a contract however customer service is customer service and theirs is very much lacking!"}
{"text":"I stumbled across this place a month or so ago and decided to give it a try.  The staff was very informative. The food was affordable and very good. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Love love LOVE this place!  I like the Breakfast chimi so much that I can't even fathom ordering anything else (and haven't!).  I've tasted a few of their other brunch items too, also delish.  My fav brunch place ever!"}
{"text":"Ocotillo feels ripped right from South Park's ShiPaTa with China Chili next door filling the role of City Wok. A strangely large space serving grub that will remind you of the offerings of a decent sports bar but with a deeply poised hipster feel."}
{"text":"I rate my experience 3 stars. Our server, Eli, was amazing and deserves 2 stars all on his own. And 1 star for the design and ambiance (before the sun went down).   We came in the late afternoon and sat outside. Unfortunately, there wasn't any shade coverage for our large party at the picnic tables- in AZ, that is crucial, even in February. I'm sure they're working on it. Even still, it was a nice afternoon. Once the sun went down, we could barely see a thing without any lights or candles at the table. Again, they're probably working on it... hopefully.   The food was good, but I feel like its wasn't as good as it should have been for the prices. The drinks, however, were worth every penny.  Even with uncomfortable accommodations, a dining experience can be rescued by the quality of service given. Eli was a knight in shining armor to quickly, accurately, and warmly help our large party. We had 16 people in our party and he managed to keep our orders straight upon delivery and splitting checks. We saw his hustle to make sure we got our food and drinks in a timely manner. The other staff helping to deliver food were friendly, but Eli was our guy! Unfortunately, Eli had the unnecessary and unfair responsibility for making up for the rude, condescending and unprofessional interaction we had with the manager, Steve. I am dumbfounded that he is the manager with that poor showing of service. I myself am a manager in the customer service industry, and have worked many years in the food industry, so I know there are stresses to be had when running a service business. But, his behavior was appalling. If management is to be the influence and example of how customers are treated, I can see why there are reviews of slow/poor service. I really hope he doesn't talk to his staff the way he talked to us. To Eli: you were amazing and I would go back to Ocotillo if you were my server again!"}
{"text":"I am writing because I truly like this place.  The ambiance is great, and the first time we went the food was great.  But it hasn't been great since then (3 more visits) because of a couple of things.  It's all hard surfaces inside, and it is so loud it actually hurts my ears.  When we went for brunch, the music was just as loud.  These two things make talking with your table-mates very unpleasant, and it isn't relaxing.  Today we went for lunch - on a weekday when most people work - and there was no hurry on the service.  The fish and chips had good flavor but was way over done.  My salad was OK, but under-dressed.  In a town where there are many great choices, these issues make a return visit unlikely.  I hope the restaurant addresses these things because it's a great environment."}
{"text":"The ambience reminds me of a Brooklyn-esque type restaurant- where else do they have a DJ playing during Sunday brunch. Lots of gorgeous outdoor seating and lots of tables for big parties.  The staff is so chill and friendly.  Highly recommend!!! The food and beverage menu is on point- conscious of local and fresh ingredients ."}
{"text":"I've been here two times and had two very different experiences. The first time we went was amazing. The food, the ambiance, the drinks and the server were all awesome. He made excellent suggestions, was totally on top of everything and really added to the meal. All of the food we ordered was also great. The cauliflower was definitely the star! We ate tapas style and each dish was better than the last one! After we left we thought we found our new go-to spot in Phoenix. Everything was 5/5.  We had such a good meal at Ocotillo that we decided to take some out of town friends there this past weekend to showcase what Phoenix has to offer. I don't know if the restaurant was having an off night or what, but it was a totally different experience. First off, I made a reservation and it still took the hostess a solid 20 minutes to seat us. That wasn't a big deal but just a little odd. The waiter who greeted us decided to take one person's drink order, take our food order and then leave. He then came back around 15 minutes later for the remaining drink orders. Also a little odd. We then proceeded to get our food \"coursed\" out over the next 2 hours. You read that correctly, we got our main dishes 2 hours after we sat down. We all enjoyed our small plates but it was pretty awkward waiting about 45 minutes in between our multiple courses. It got to the point where we were tempted to cancel our main dishes because they took forever. They came out ice cold and we just asked for them to box them up. The waiter could tell that he messed up because he brought out two complementary desserts to make up for it. That was a nice touch, but the service was 1/5.   Overall I need to drop Ocotillo to 3 overall stars. The ambiance and food were on point both times. Just the lack of service makes me second guess if this is where I'd want to go for an expensive meal or take friends to showcase the great food scene in town."}
{"text":"Lunch today was delightful. Patio seating lovely. Banh MI Tofu sandwich with dip perfectly executed. I highly recommend this restaurant for vegetarians as there are many delicious options."}
{"text":"The brunch menu is excellent! There really isn't a bad item on it. I personally struggle to get anything other than the steak and eggs now that I tried them."}
{"text":"Ocotillo opened yesterday for coffee and lunch only. I don't usually try restaurants that just open, but had heard from a friend that it was good. My husband ordered the sausage sandwich and a beer and I had the mussels and iced tea. The food was great, and I like to think of myself as a connoisseur of mussels. These were cooked perfectly - obviously done, but tender and not a second over-cooked. The broth was amazing - shallots, tomatoes, garlic, lime, cilantro, and red pepper flakes. The two crostini served with the mussels and broth were grilled jut right. My husband really enjoyed his sandwich which was served with cole slaw on it and French fries on the side. I didn't have any fries, but they were thin cut and looked to be fried to perfection. The facility is beautiful - open, light, hip, spacious, with a beautiful outdoor area we can't wait to try when it cools down.  The best part? The service! The GM was extremely attentive, as was our server, Sarah. We will be back many times, and very soon!"}
{"text":"The restaurant has a very attractive urban/industrial modern vibe with huge outdoor seating areas.  The menu is unique and interesting and the food was excellent.  I was particularly interested that their house made pastas weren't the typical flat fettuccine or pappardelle; they included a variety of unusual shapes such as my baked pasta that had a curved shape with a ridged edge and was served with a rich cream sauce, house made pancetta and peas.  My husband had another unusual pasta shape (long strands with little buttons on one edge) served with a curried beef ragu.  Our starter was the roasted cauliflower due to all the raves on Yelp, which were justified - we both agreed that we need to figure out how to make it at home!  Serve was attentive and very good.    So why four stars rather than five?  Three very minor issues: 1.  I asked for some bread early on, which the server said she would bring and then she forgot.  Luckily my husband's pasta came with two pieces of grilled bread (oddly, mine didn't) so we shared. 2. Our cauliflower starter was room temp, which we presumed was correct.  The table next to us also ordered the cauliflower and theirs arrived steaming.  Presumably it was equally good both ways but service should be consistent. 3. One piece of the house made pancetta in my pasta was too chewy and gristly to eat.  I personally would have preferred a leaner, crisper meat but I know pork belly is all the rage at the moment.  Again, they were very minor issues and we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"First night in town we came to Ocotillo. An unforgettable start to my trip here. Nicole Soultaire recommended each of the delectable dishes we tried. Don't forget to ask about her favorite dessert."}
{"text":"Architecture... Love Love Love...  I love the look of the place and the overall concept, although I am wondering what it will be like when it is 115 in the summer.   Drinks... The Sazerac was too sweet... The slightly dirty martini was very dirty and short.  Dinner...  The burger was good and basic with no choice of cheese or bacon, the fries were well seasoned but warm.  The bucatini was ok, pasta was very nice, the sauce needed salt and something more (like more garlic or more basil)  Noise level.. HIGH Server... We sat at the bar. she was over worked but really nice The big mistake was when one of the bartenders dropped a squeeze bottle on the floor where it stayed for a minute before it got picked up and put back into the well... I brought it to my bartenders attention and she pulled it out and apologized"}
{"text":"I heard the patio to this place was awesome.... And it absolutely is. Hence the 2 stars for amazing ambiance.  The menu was.... well we decided to just have drinks instead. So we ordered a pitcher of Sangria. That was the negative stars. Honestly I wish they would have just told me it wasn't home made or have some sort of disclaimer that it came from a Wal-Mart bottle.  Their sangria consisted of 2 blueberries, half an orange slice, 1/2 a disintegrated rasperberry, 1 bottle of $5 dollar bottle of cheap white wine labeled \"sangria\".  Over about 1/ 2 gal of ice. It was $18 and so bad thayt I had to add about 4 limes to drink my 1 and only glass.   Stick with the overpriced beers on the patio."}
{"text":"We definitely got treated to a fun afternoon by our waiter Brendan A. Great recommendations & full glasses of champagne!"}
{"text":"If you love SF, LA and NY then make a beeline for Ocotillo.  Best new design in the Valley with stunning indoor and outdoor spaces. Fantastic, fresh, dimensional food. Breakfast chimi, avocado toast, and bread pudding were all simple, memorable, and cravable.  Plus a cool vibe, great music, and a hip urban crowd.  Ocotillo just raised the bar for the Phx restaurant scene. Can't wait to see their upcoming dinner offerings!"}
{"text":"I have personally been to Ocotillo about four times now and every time I've been impressed with what the team behind this place have done. They have created a great spot for folks to just grab a morning coffee, a light lunch, night out dinning or just a great place to hang with friends for a lazy Sunday in a chilled out atmosphere. The food is cutting edge while homely, offering great bites for lunch and dinner. Everything is so fresh and tasty from the grilled pork sausage sandwich, which is a steal for $9 to the roasted cauliflower or the crispy fish they served for dinner. Amazing!! Can't recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"Great find in central Phoenix. The overall design and great atmosphere is what initially stands out but the food and service are excellent. I ordered from the brunch menu on a busy Saturday morning. The smoked brisket served over parmesan polenta with a fried egg was a well put together and satisfying dish. The ginger mint lemonade was the perfect accompaniment. We will definitely be back to try out the dinner menu."}
{"text":"Great food...huge portions including the salads so plan to share. Wasn't a fan of the seating or lighting but will visit again."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Besides the beautiful architecture that is thoughtful and the perfect mix of indoor/outdoor the food is wonderful and unique and the service is stellar. The people who own the place are straight up awesome and are always making sure you are enjoying yourself. The cauliflower is great and at the coffee bar the cereal milk latte and Nutella croissant are killer. So happy to have this place in midtown, great addition and vibe."}
{"text":"I know I say this on every review but I eat out almost every day... This was one of the best dining experiences I've had in Phoenix in a while... we started with roasted cauliflower which is a little bit pricey at $11 but well worth it... Perfect for sharing.  I had the smoked brisket sandwich was one of the best sandwiches I've ever had with arugula and caramelize onions. Get the broccolini salad!  I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Went here Friday night and they sat our dinner party in the bar which was extremely noisy. Sitting outside would have been wonderful but they had a private party. As for the food, had to send my brussel sprout salad back b/c they put some nasty cold tough chicken on top. Got a pesto pasta and it was good, although it needed lots of salt and pepper. Terrible service. Overall, disappointing experience, have had many friends tell me how much they love it."}
{"text":"Looks hipster enough if you like that sort of thing. But the sound acoustics  inside the restaurant are horrible. It is so damn loud. Likely will not be back."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing the food is great and staff is very friendly. We had Taylor as our server and had great recommendations for us to try for wine and the food based on our taste. We definitely will be back to try there brunch"}
{"text":"Tasty food and the ambience of this restaurant is great! I enjoyed my cauliflower veggie dish and the falafel sandwich was fantastic! The service was a bit slow, which I figured since it's a fairly new place. I enjoyed watching the chefs cooking in the kitchen and everything looked clean and in order. Surprisingly it's a large space and they have a separate area for the coffee shop, which I didn't get a chance to try but will definitely return to sample their coffee."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. Overall a good experience. The initial service was rather slow but our food came out very quickly once we ordered. I ordered the Nutella iced coffee boba and was disappointed at how little boba was actually in the drink. The presentation of the breakfast pork flautas was put together very nicely and was delicious as well!"}
{"text":"Eh. I heard raves about this place and stopped in for lunch. HUGE disappointment. The prices are high, too high for what you get in my opinion. The service was not great. I didn't like my meal, but it was so pricey and I was hungry I had no choice. The problem is, I left still being hungry!  The location is great and the space unique - now if they'd only improve the food part."}
{"text":"OMG!! Is it possible to find a place that has great atmosphere, terrific service, awesome food and plenty of seating space?!?!?  To say I'm impressed is an understatement! Our Sunday Brunch was amazing! From the wonderful atmosphere to the phenomenal food I went home drooling and planning my return trip!   We started with the Pineapple Coconut Upside Down Pancake. That alone, with the bottle of mimosa, was ecstasy on a patio! But no, we rolled the dice and ordered some more.. My fried chicken breakfast was so crisp, yet deliciously tender inside that I am a renewed fan of friend chicken!   Any place that brings you a bottle of champagne and various side juices to complement your mimosa  knows how to set the stage for a fantastic brunch. Back to the menu, my wife had the salmon and let's  just say she usually shares but not this time.. guess it was delicious!   Writing this review is making me hungry so I'll have to finish with a few photos. Otherwise I may start chewing on my phone,.. Update to follow.."}
{"text":"Wow, I am still perplexed by the crappy service and food, we just experienced. Let's start front the beginning. We had a reservation for 6 at 11:15. We were seating and all was good. It took 15 minutes for them to take our drink orders  20 minutes after that we got our drinks. Another 5 minutes after drinks arrived to get glasses to drink our drinks as we ordered pitchers. Then we were informed that there were no chimichanga for brunch at 11:30 right after they opened.  Then the drinks themselves: Pitcher of Sangria really watered down and way to much ice. Bloody Mary pitcher was just tomato juice and horseradish, one of the worst we have tasted.  The  food arrived not all together and items missing. When they brought out the 2 burgers They said Med rare and well done. They never asked us how we wanted them cooked. I said none of us would order well done and we were not asked how we want them cooked. They took it back and then can back 30 seconds later and placed it down in the table. We cut into it, and it was the well done burger. We decided after all the f up's we would just deal wth it. Tired of all the errors and we were hungry! The food itself was satisfactory nothing I would ever say I need to come back and eat again. Then the bill came and  they charged one of the 3 cards twice. It was a total cluster and the food was just average with no seasoning. They need to get it together. We will never be back! This was the worst experience. Not the worst food, but the worst experience.  Update It only gets worse We gave it a second try and order sangria only to be told they are out of sangria... Wth... Go to Safeway and buy cheap wine, fruit, brandy, simple syrup whatever you use.  I guess I'm a glutton for punishment."}
{"text":"Love the new summer menu!  We've been to Ocotillo every which way: brunch, lunch, dinner and bar, so we know our way around the menus.  Last night, a Saturday, we tried some of the new dishes.  The Persian cucumbers with miso and peppers was crunchy with a great combination of cool and spicy flavors.  Next up was our favorite: sliced & grilled summer squash with squash blossoms, pesto, some yummy breadcrumbs and a sauce that brought the whole thing together.  FIsh loving Hubby had the fresh halibut special with Israeli couscous, and he gave it 5 stars.  I had the housemade cavarecce pasta with a lusciously spicy sauce and surprise: a few bites of sweet crunch  - carrots I think?  We still had room for the Almond Joy to share: 2 scoops each of coconut & chocolate sorbet wi toasted almonds, perfect on a hot summer evening. David the sommelier came up with a Spanish white wine that paired perfectly with the halibut, I had the Sazerac with my pasta, great cocktail from their mixologist.   There are new salads that I can't wait to try on a lunch visit, small gems lettuce & buttermilk dressing and a fresh carrot offering were two.  New season, new experiences at a favorite spot."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed. Our friends said it was good but not tonight. Beef ribs were flavorful but came out cold. The Ocotillo chicken came out cold as well. The pasta was just ok."}
{"text":"Great tasting food, white wine and beer.  Loved the curry coconut soup and vegetables, and he enjoyed his fries that were NOT watered down like other eatery places are. Best fries ever and their sandwiches too.  The waiters were friendly and we had no problems. We sat inside and what we liked was the fact that their music wasn't super loud like other places are. The outdoor area is beautiful and welcoming. Looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"The menu provides a nice variety from \"small\" to \"large\" and even the small plates made for a great lunch.  The variety is great and food is delicious.  However, inside was quite noisy, which made it hard to talk.  Would go back!"}
{"text":"Been there several times (8 and counting) ...ALWAYS had great food.  Never have we had anything that wasn't great. Amazing brunch place!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has an empacable food and trendy place. Be prepared to wait longer during Fridays. Food is always good and savory. We're been coming to this place for a year now.   We've tried almost all of the food and drink a in their menu and honestly speaking, all were so delicious.   In terms of service, I would say It's at par compare to other restaurants in the valley."}
{"text":"Great eclectic meals. Some include substantial servings... A little busy and noisy, but very much a fun place with great service staff."}
{"text":"Wow! What a amazing surprise to have blindly walked into this establishment. The experience was one that I will talk about and reflect on for years to come. I immediately noticed the wonderful atmosphere and seductive aroma that filled the the air. My senses reacted and sprang to life! My nose and eyes spotted a beautiful looking pasta dish and asked what's that? I then was greeted and introduced to Martin a very friendly and insightful young man. Martin not only answered my question but he gave me the history of the Resturant and the philosophy of the chef and then introduced me to their lovely staff and finely some of the most interesting and freshest tastes this pallet of mine has experienced in many of year. I don't believe you could go wrong with any of the choices on their menu. This is one of those rare finds. A place where you can actually taste the love in every bite."}
{"text":"The only thing I've heard about this place was .... you GOTTA try the brunch. On a Wednesday night my friend and I were searching Yelp, making brunch plans for the upcoming Sunday. I said but what's for dinner tonight, she said let's try Ocotillo to it and someplace else for brunch Sunday. I agreed.   I don't remember the wine we ordered that event no but we shared the buffalo wings, spare ribs and braised greens. Everything, everything was off. I won't say wrong because I'm not sure but very thing was definitely off. The buffalo wings were way to chewy, big, slimy and slightly cold on the inside, all of which meant they weren't cooked long enough. Same with the ribs, however we believe they were cooked a little too long, and wayyyy before we ordered them. Like perhaps they were cooked earlier, then when we ordered them they threw them in the cast iron skillet to heat them out.   When the server brought them out and said be careful the plate is really hot. We carefully put one rib on our plate with a fork. I picked mine up to bite and realized it was not as hot as I thought it would be. I took one bite and for sure, it was kinda cool too! That was enough for me to not want to try them for brunch or dinner again for that matter."}
{"text":"Second time coming here tonight and unfortunately SERVICE AND MANAGEMENT ARE HORRIBLE!!!  the wait staff and management wanted to use excuses for bad service like it wasn't their problem. Not only was the waitress was training someone she didn't even introduce the trainee. she brought my girlfriends drink from the bar finally after We're done eating the appetizer.. Net net: if you make a mistake DON'T tell me your excuses, training people, waiting on big parties. I said we wanted to leave, and not order dinner. She said was it my \"service\" (lack of service) I said yes it actually was..... She was shocked that I told the truth, then she couldn't handle it and vanished never to return to the table, I had to ask the new trainee for the bill. Not once did either of them get the manager. They tried to charge us for the drink (that we didn't drink) when we said we wanted to go. I said please get the manager, the manager on duty came by and said we were notified of bad service. She Started to to make excuses saying they had too many people, training and had a big party out back and was overwhelmed. Sorry Ocotillo you should be focused on \"if you build it people will come\" people did come to your huge restaurant and you couldn't show up for the customer in the main food dining area."}
{"text":"I had lunch with a colleague here and it was pretty good.  Some friends and I decided to try it for dinner.  The facility is lovely with   pleasant outdoor seating.  The food was very inconsistent, however.  some of the dishes were quite good like the chicken meatballs and the cauliflower, others were decidedly lacking such as the grilled octopus and beef ravioli.  One of my companions even reported mild food poisoning afterwards-  not sure if it was the food or something else.  All in all, i wouldn't return for dinner.  I might try it again for lunch."}
{"text":"Ocotillo has an incredibly large and pleasant patio that I'm sure would be a lovely hang out spot in cool months. The interior is also hip and trendy, and a fun place to spend time. I ordered the tuna sandwich and my fiancé ordered the falafel burger. Everything was tasty and brought out to us very quickly. Though portions were large, prices seemed high. Also ordered a pims cup on a whim; unique and tasty beverage! Would definitely return to hang out on the patio"}
{"text":"I brought a friend that was visiting from Washington D.C. and we both really enjoyed the lunch here. I ordered the fried chicken BLT and it was delicious. The portions are huge. The staff was friendly and had a pretty relaxed atmosphere. I have been here once for brunch and I enjoyed that a lot more. The brunch menu is phenomenal. I would much prefer brunch over the lunch menu but all around this is a great spot! I also think its really cool how they have their own coffee shop outside. Lots of outdoor seating for big parties."}
{"text":"This is a nice kind of foo foo place . Not sure what it is it's trying to be.  This is Phoenix after all and although right now the weather makes it a super great place to go because most of it is outside once those temperatures hit about a 100 nobody's going to want to be here. But some people like the Heat and that will be the place to be if you do. Wasn't impressed much for the food menu items ...large wine selections and beers...neighborhood bar,  upscale. Downside parking and the people who are so extremely rude about it make me not want to bother again."}
{"text":"Wow!  Great dining experience!  House specialty cocktails were a unique twist on traditional drinks.  The shaved Brussel sprout and kale salad was huge.  The roasted  cauliflower  with kale pesto, mint and basil was fantastic.  We had the scallop ceviche and ocotillo chicken for our main courses.  For desert, we had a dark chocolate and coconut gelato on a bed of toasted coconut.  Loved it all and we will be back."}
{"text":"Hmmm. Everything is amazing about this restaurant. We started with a glass of Malbec and Pinot noir of course you can't go wrong there.  As appetizers we ordered the ricotta and the scallop ceviche! The ricotta was amazing we ended up having to get more bread to enjoy every last little drop.   My boyfriends ordered the ocotillo chicken and I got the lumache pasta. The chicken had a honey base that was to die for and the skinny was very crispy... The lumache came with a goat cheese that made the pasta that much more tastier!   Overall amazing experience, great service and an even better atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Amazing place off the beaten path just far enough to still be able to get in and get a table when you wish. Enjoy it now before it's truly discovered. Once that happens, you won't be able to get a table here for love or money.  But for now, it's great, good food, great coffee, and the staff is as nice as they can be!"}
{"text":"Taylor the server handled our huge baby shower with grace and kindness! And that strawberry toast was DELICIOUS"}
{"text":"Came here on a whim since there were so many good reviews but i am honestly disappointed. I took .5 stars off because our waiter was so awkward and stood there in silence for a minute. Another .5 stars off because they say this place is American but there was no American anything on the menu. I took another star off because the dishes my friend and I ordered were mediocre. I took .5 stars since they were out of boba...how do you not stock enough boba for your one specialty dtink? Lastly, the noise and atmosphere I took .5 stars off for. The place is super loud and they're trying to be fancy when the place is super casual. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere.  Staff is attentive.   Bright and open spaces.  Outdoor areas are very nice as well!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if it's the different chefs or what the situation is, but I've had vastly different experiences between the times I've been here and what day of the week it is. Its almost as if the same dish is not the same recipe at all...like, at all. If the food was consistent, this would be one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Wow, just Wow. Try the brisket and you will dream about it. The house made smoked salmon is to die for. I can't wait to get back here to work my way down the menu. Our server Joshua was the best!!!"}
{"text":"The food was great and the service was equally as wonderful. I'm visiting and will definitely come back to this place whenever I'm in the Phoenix metro area"}
{"text":"I came to this place a couple of weeks ago and all was pretty good... Came back today and it was a disaster, service wasn't very good this time. In addition, my husband ordered scrambled eggs and they were almost raw to the point that he could barely eat any of it (only the edge got cooked). When we mentioned this to our waiter \"hey, just wanted to share feedback that the eggs were not cooked\" all she said was \"ok\"... then she came with our check and apologized and said she \"took care of the issue\", we noticed she took $2 off of our $30 check... regardless of the amount and not even expecting a discount at all, based on principle, this experience today sucked... doubt we'll be back..."}
{"text":"Food was incredible here.   I had the sundried strawberries with herbed ricotta.   The texture and flavor of the strawberries was so unique and delicious and the pairing with the ricotta was perfect.   The only recommendation I'd have is a better bread and more of it.   I ended up eating half without any toast,  but it was so good I didn't care! My husband had the beef tar tar and he loved it.  We were seated on the front patio,  but next time I'd request the back patio."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. Good location with lots of parking. Many places to sit and eat or just have coffee. Delicious food. Terrific service. It would be a great place for a group event."}
{"text":"Our first impression walking in from the parking lot was, \"Wow, this is a cool place!\" First we walked past a separate coffee shop that had a large and inviting patio. As we approached the uniquely designed restaurant, there were outdoor seating areas with awnings, trees, and other unusual touches.   A smiling hostess seated us promptly in a room with fetching photos of roiling Arizona skies. Our welcoming server, Sunna, took our drink orders as we perused the creative menu. My wife ordered cauliflower over a bed of substantive nutty salad, and I ordered Portuguese soup with mixed large beans, sausage, greens, and herbs in a superb stock.   The dishes arrived straight from the open kitchen. The cauliflower dish was dazzling, mounted in one piece nestled into the salad. The appealing soup came in a large, deep bowl with a handle and accompanied by amazing grilled bread.   Ellen moaned with delight as she delved into the cauliflower and salad. She handed me a bite and I had never known cauliflower could taste so good. She had a spoon of my soup and loved it.   Sunna checked on us early and found happy campers! Ellen and I decided to eat half of our dishes and switch. Together this combo made one of the best lunches we've had in a very long time.   Our experience at Ocotillo was exceptional and Sunna was a big part of it. We plan to go back soon, and we will tell our friends about it. Now I'm telling you about it--go! Ocotillo is a gem."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and the food is delicious.  My server's name was Mac and he is an absolute dream.  I love everything about this place!"}
{"text":"Nice people, beautiful spot.  We eat low on the food chain, so appreciate the veg selections. But this place is a bit expensive! Whole fish for two $42.00. Long beans $9.  Please carry some less expensive choices. Oh, and the pasta with red sauce and shrimp:  I've had this twice. I was fighting off a migraine on the first time, but ordered again in compis mentis and it was still awful. Burned (\"baked\") garlic dominates the tasteless shrimp. I love fresh, not burned garlic. This recipe should tilt towards the sweetness of shrimp and tomato, maybe sun dried would strengthen the sweet.  Thanks for the attractive spacious outdoor venue! I'll be back when baked cauliflower is in season."}
{"text":"YES! Go on an empty stomach because we waddled outta here stuffed! Ordered the Pita with peppers and guac, the summer squash, and the scallops to split between myself and the hubbs. The presentation of the food is gorgeous, and the taste is to match! Such a fulfilling and wholesome taste. Instead of filling the plate with 3789 things they concentrate on bringing out the full flavor of the intended main item. Now, my husband and I don't typically go to these types of 'pretentious' places...to the point where we didn't know what to do when the bartender came over and laid down our napkins...and sat there with them on our laps for a good 5 minutes before realizing other patrons were using them as place mats...SMH. But, if you're looking to be fancy for a night then this is a great spot to pretend you know what you're doing! We sat inside at the bar, but it looks like the outdoor patio is a bit more lax. With the open kitchen I felt like I was in a Manhattan restaurant. Also, who knew Pimm's cup was so delicious? We couldn't say no to the refills! We will be visiting again for brunch, lunch, and dinner! Looking forward to experiencing the other areas of the multi-structured compound."}
{"text":"***UPDATE after leaving this review, the owner felt it appropriate to leave a comment, using the alleged death of a cook as a valid excuse for his entire restaurant to not be able to function. Using death as a way to manipulate honest reviews of people's bad experiences at your restaraunt IS A BAD LOOK. GET IT TOGETHER WALTER. If TWO PEOPLE being absent throws your entire business off, you got bigger problems than bad reviews.... I wasn't even going to say anything until I read another review below where you did the same thing to them.   Really wanted to like this place! You can tell a lot of money went into it, so you'd think they'd do a little bit better with their service. Great atmosphere, it is a little bit brighter than id like to see at a dinner place. So we were seated after waiting for 30 minutes at the bar, our waiter took about ten minutes to even greet us, he did get our appetizer out rather quickly but then much to our dismay the two tables next to us, who were sat after us, recieved their meals before us. There was a 45 minute lapse between our appetizer and our main course.... which is just unacceptable. Our appetizer (shitake mushrooms) was delicious. Our main courses, two pasta dishes, were burned and left much to be desired. I will say they did comp our meals and a drink, which was very kind. But there's just nothing worse than feeling like youre being ignored, especially when you're starving and really eager to try a new menu. :-/ This is why im always willing to pay a little more at restaraunts, like for example Christopher's at the Biltmore. More expensive but this kind of experience would NEVER happen there. Put more money into training your cooks and wait staff and less into the tile and lighting! Undecided if I will go to Ocotillo again."}
{"text":"Great new restaurant with ample outdoor space. I got pasta and tuna which was really good. Food is a generous portion as well. The girl across the bar was raving about this Thai coconut soup so that will be next on the list.   Good location near downtown / central Phoenix but has plenty of parking . Park off flower.   If you're a wine connoisseur then this is your place. There are little icons next to the each wine to explain the flavor.   It was pretty busy so thumbs up to the curly brunette food runner working his butt off and running around"}
{"text":"Been here a few times now. The design & different seating areas are great. In the past I remember service & quality being generally pretty good. On the most recent visit my group ended up here after the original place we wanted to try was packed & really warm inside. I knew there would be a wait at Ocotillo (11:30am on a Saturday) but at least I could count on a little more space & that it would be nice & cool, which it was! Took around 35 minutes to get a table for 4. I don't know if they were understaffed but service was very slow. I was really hungry by the time we got seated (doesn't help that I'm 36 weeks pregnant) & the waiter didn't seem to catch our urgency to order. He was EXTREMELY NICE but seemed distracted & would rush off if we hesitated by the slightest. Getting drinks took a long time. I ordered the Two Eggs breakfast which is supposed to come with a coffee. It didn't. Half way through the meal I asked about it & the reply was, \"Oh. I don't normally bring it unless guests ask.\" I think he just forgot honestly, because I've ordered the same breakfast in the past & the coffee came out ahead of time. He did make me a custom iced coffee though for no extra charge so that was cool! The food is good! Their Applewood Bacon is amazing! The Blue Corn Pancake is something legends are made of! I know I will end up back here at some point simply because of the dishes but I hope service gets better. Also, why can't you order things from the coffee bar when you're at the restaurant!? You used to be able to, don't know when it changed. Since I was so hungry in the beginning, I asked about getting some kind of pastry or something & was told I would have to go to the coffee bar & get it myself. I did & I was allowed to bring it back to our table but it seems silly! Kind of like having a bar at your restaurant but guests have to go get the drinks themselves. Like huh??"}
{"text":"Great venue, and great coffee shop. But the main restaurant? I used to feel so/so about the service, until I came for Happy Hour with work colleagues and got Bryce as our server. He was fantastic! Incredibly fun, friendly, and well-informed on the drinks. I ended up with some great cocktails and wine, including The Last One- really hit the spot. Thanks, Bryce and Ocotillo Cafe for an awesome experience!"}
{"text":"Went to dinner with a friend who had been here for brunch. The cauliflower appetizer was delicious; it was sitting in kale pesto and nuts which I wanted to dump directly into my mouth. I tried one of the pasta dishes for my entrée. The serving size was good as I could not finish it, and it was served with two slices of grilled bread. They even brought another plate of complimentary bread as requested as my pasta had burrata which was good on the bread. The service was a little off, like our server was not very experienced or was fairly new to this restaurant. The overall concept is cool with the main restaurant, bar, and beer garden. I wish they had more happy hour offerings, but I plan on returning one weekend and giving brunch a try. The food is fresh, and you can tell some thought went into the menu."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love Ocotillo based on the pictures I saw posted & the reviews I read through. Unfortunately, for us that was not the case. We went in for my boyfriends birthday dinner and had even higher expectations for this reason. When we arrived, we were greeted and offered a seat in either the dining room, the bar area, or the heated patio. We opted for the dining room and were taken to our seats immediately. My first observation was that the seating was so close together on both sides of the table that even a normal sized person would have issues squeezing through to get to the booth seat! Also, while no body around us was talking loudly, their entire conversation could be heard simply based on the fact that they were so close to us. The restaurant itself was very loud which made it hard to have a conversation either way.  Our waiter came by soon after we were seated and took our drink and appetizer order. We got the fried zucchini first. When another waiter dropped it off at our table, he walked away so fast I couldn't even ask him for a couple of small plates so we could share, and we were also missing one set of silverware. It took a few minutes to track someone down to get what we needed. The dish itself, while it was decent, was definitely nothing to write home about. The biggest problem with it was that it was lacking salt! The burrata with the zucchini was an interesting combination and paired well with the spicy peppers & balsamic. I most likely would ask for it without mint ... and again, not to harp on this but I believe this would have been really tasty with a sprinkle of salt!  The orginal waiter came by as we were eating the appetizer to ask if we had decided on our main meals yet. It felt a bit rushed as he hadn't bothered coming by to check on us regarding the appetizer, but we ordered the Ocotillo Chicken & the Peking Duck. Even though it was busy, it didn't take too long for them to bring the food out. The plates looked absolutely beautiful when they were dropped off to us! The taste however ... I'd say it was interesting.  Firstly, the best thing at the table was the polenta that was underneath the duck. It was really creamy and tasty, I don't know how it was made but if I could just order a bowl of that, I would! I don't care for duck but did have a couple of bites and noticed it was well cooked & had a very crispy skin. It wasn't particularly flavorful though, so if you order this, make sure you like duck! My boyfriend said he's pretty much done with duck as it tastes really gamey.  Next, the chicken dish - my biggest complaint is that it was really hard to cut. For some reason, I was expecting that they'd just have chicken breasts a top the potato salad but this wasn't the case. The dish that the food was served in was so small it took a lot of effort to separate what I wanted to eat with the bones that I didn't. Another waiter noticed my struggle and brought a larger knife. Unfortunately, by that point, I was just done trying. The potato salad was yummy and tasted good with the au jus that was on the bottom. The chicken itself also had a really crispy skin like the duck, but didn't have much flavor.  Yet again, our waiter came by just to drop off the check. If the other components of the restaurant really wow'ed us, we would have consider coming back for a meal a different day. The service was really lacking and the prices of the dishes were really high (not worth it) so unfortunately, it was probably our first and last time at Ocotillo."}
{"text":"Ocotillo is unique on the inside and outside. It looks like a renovated storage unit and it offers a variety of seating arrangements- tables and couches outside, long high tables inside as well as booths on one end and white tablecloth seating on the opposite end. The vibe of Ocotillo seems hip casual but also somewhat upscale. I ate here for dinner one night and my food was very tasty. We ordered a cauliflower for the table that was cooked perfectly and has a delicious mint and peanut flavor. The meat eaters at the table were pretty impressed and wouldn't stop raving about it. After placing my entree order for a falafel burger I immediately felt like I made a mistake and should have ordered something more interesting because there menu has delicious sounding small plates, pasta and salads to choose from but WOW. For not being a Mediterranean restaurant, they do falafel RIGHT. Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside and not dry. The beets that accompanied it made it outstanding. Everyone else at my table was pleased with their food- pastas and ribs.  My only complaint is that you don't have the option to order a lighter side with a sandwich or burger- it just comes with fries.  The service was okay, not fantastic but they were relatively new at the time so I'm sure it's improved. I had a fun experience so I'm definitely going back!"}
{"text":"This place was absolutely delicious! I tried my friend's chicken and I ordered the Japanese fish and chips.  Omg---sooooo good!!! The only reason I am giving it 4 stars, rather than 5 is because the tables are WAY tooooo close together and because it is kind of pricy for a lunch menu. If I was just rating based off of the flavor,  then 5 stars for sure!"}
{"text":"I wanted to give a special thanks to Eli Hudson our wonderful server on Mothers Day! We had a very large party. Not only was it Mothers Day but it was also my mom's 80th birthday! Everything was delicious and hot! I hope when we come again we get Eli as our server!"}
{"text":"I flew in from New York to visit a friend and we had planned to visit Ocotillo for lunch when I arrived. We sat for a while with no server in sight so we left. I sent an email to the restaurant about our experience since we were so disappointed. I tell you this back story because a lot of establishments (when they do respond) respond with dismissive excuses. The owner personally reached out to me immediately and we had a conversation. He invited us back to the restaurant so we could start over. We went in for brunch and had an amazing meal with amazing service. I'm very happy we took him up on his offer because the food is absolutely amazing. The restaurant is great, the space is inviting, and the brunch DJ added the perfect ambiance to the restaurant. My friends are going back next weekend for brunch and it's now on the top of my list the next time I'm in Phoenix. Do yourself a favor and order the Crispy Pork Belly if it's on the menu - brunch perfection!!!"}
{"text":"Second visit to this beautiful space, and it was a definite hit.  Reserved for two and since we were a bit early had a drink at the bar.  Wine list is very cool, with an unusual \"symbolic\" profile for each selection. Really pretty cool so you know exactly what you're getting when you order. Excellent BTG selection. Interesting list of house special cocktails. Highly recommend if you're in the mood for something different.   After our libation we were seated at a very comfy booth near the bar, in sight of the kitchen - which was sparkling clean btw with the cooks laser focused on their stations. The menu had changed somewhat since our first visit so we were interested to try new things.   First course, we split a salad.  All are large enough to share. We chose the Watermelon, mango, avocado, arugula with toasted coconut.  Superb.  Very refreshing with an excellent range of textures and nice balance of the sweeter mango and melon with the peppery arugula. Perfectly dressed as well.   Next was a halibut ceviche.  Great portion as well.  Halibut succulent, not chewy as some can be when the acid is applied too early.  Ripe tomatoes added a nice color and offset the tomatillo purée nicely.  The surprise addition of corn nuts really made the dish as it added a great bit of crunch and saltiness.  Well done.   Third came a pita and spicy Dahl dish with blistered shishito peppers, olives and a bit of salad.  The Dahl was outstanding, not really hot spicy, but very flavorful with just enough kick.  A good meatless choice and enough to share...most definitely.   For entrees, the lady had the scallops from the small plates section.  Perfectly seared with nice crust outside and buttery smooth inside. Sauce had just enough acid to make the buttery scallops pop!  I chose the Crispy Duck Confit.  Again, a great portion. Duck fall off the bone tender, yet crispy crunchy skin intact.  Accompanied by some stone ground grits and a sweet cherry based relish that was a great counterpoint to the richness of the duck.   By this time we were too full and dessert was not in the cards for us...next time.   Can't wait until summer heat subsides and the patio opens up. Will be a great place to hit for lunch or dinner...or drinks!  Oh, BTW...service was outstanding.  When you go, consider yourself fortunate if Eli is your guy.  He's great...so we're the bartenders!  We'll be back soon with friends.  Go...soon!"}
{"text":"We checked out the Ocotillo coffee bar in the a.m. which was absolutely delightful.  Delicious homemade pastries, good beverages, and a quiet, pleasant, stylish and spacious courtyard in which to hang out (with both sun and shade, grass and concrete, even with bike parking!).    Went back later for brunch - lots of affordable vegetarian items on the menu, and they did not disappoint!  Portions were large and we had a really delicious fresh salad.  However, they seemed a bit understaffed and while service was fine, it wasn't memorably fantastic.  But the worst of it was that there seemed to be some sort of bachelorette party going on with a truly horrible DJ - soulless, bass-thumping \"music,\" way too loud.  There was nowhere you could sit to avoid the music. Unfortunately I couldn't wait to get out of there.  The music ruined the whole ambience as it didn't go with the space at all - something more mellow and soulful (and not quite so loud) would have made the experience so much better!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a nicer trendy restaurant and bar with a great outdoor area...look no further.  Located conveniently in Central Phoenix this place is an oasis in the city with great food and plenty of outdoor area with lush greenery and in modern setting.  We went here for lunch for my boss' going away party and sat inside.  The service and food were excellent.  They have beautiful artwork and pictures from local artists which really makes for an enjoying atmosphere.  The outdoor space is amazing and I wish we sat outside because this is the perfect time of year to enjoy the beautiful AZ weather.    I had the Korean BBQ Brisket sandwich and side of fries which was amazing. There are a lot of unique dishes which will keep me coming back for more.  They even make their own pasta noodle and have a pastry chef for the desserts!  A must try if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"I was anxious to try this place so ventured out with a dear friend for some vittles a couple of weeks ago.  First of all, the location is gorgeous---lots of outdoor seating and centrally located as well.  The weather is finally cooperating so dining al fresco was certainly in order.  We arrrived at 11ish on a Sunday to be told that there was a 30-minute wait to be seated.  We were then told we could have made a reservation.  Note to self.  We ended up sitting at a communal table to order brunch. My friend had a burger and I had short ribs, eggs, and grits.  The coffee was nice and our water glasses were kept filled.  We were there for roughly 2 hours and I never once saw anyone seated outside.  I guess I don't understand the concept behind reservations for later (?) when there are hungry people waiting right then and tons of outdoor seating available.  I was really excited about the Mexican corn appetizer on the menu, thinking excitedly about it for days.  Turns out it hasn't been on the menu for quite some time.  Although my brunch was delicious, I was really disappointed.  We sat near the DJ, who seemed to be enjoying the music.  I haven't yet developed an appreciation for this kind of music during the daytime so it took some getting used to.  All in all, my experience was only OK.  I REALLY wanted to love this place but wasn't bowled over.  Some suggestions:  Put updated menus on Yelp.  Put the DJ outside.  Utilize that great outdoor space.  So much potential!!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere and quality of their mimosa earned the two stars and nothing more. The hostess argued with me about sitting at a table for four outside with only two of us- despite the restaurant being less than 20% full. The server then greeted us with the same lackluster and almost annoyed attitude. So sad to waste such a great atmosphere and mimosa with garbage service.   Addition: I left and called, requesting to talk to a manager and was placed on hold. After 8 minutes (I timed it) my fiancée (sitting next to me in the car) called and also requested to speak to a manager. She was asked if she just called, which she replied \"no\" and was placed on hold as well. Note- I am still holding. The manager answered answered HER call after less than two minutes while I was still holding! Unbelievable  *UPDATE: This was the GM's response to me. I guess the customer isn't always right."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. The service was pretty slow. I get that it was a Saturday morning and we had a group, but the waitress took half our groups drink order before ours and 15 minutes later came back for ours. The breakfast chimi was pretty good though. I could have done without the potato cake it was pretty dry and bland."}
{"text":"I was contacted  by a manager of this establishment who invited me back due to my past experience, and boy did they redeem themselves!  Because of the incredible service and atmosphere, my husband and I recommended Ocotillo to a cousin for his graduation dinner, so we conveniently attended with the other guests.    The manager (Dave) was extremely kind and generous, offering to compensate my dinner for returning.  And later offered dessert!!  Wow.  I had the ribs with the mole espresso barbecue sauce and lime fries.  My husband had the pork shank and our little guy had a grilled cheese.  Of course I tried everything. And there was no disappointment!    The serving sizes were very generous, the food was fresh and delicious, and the service was (again) impeccable.  I'm glad I came back and will visit again in the future."}
{"text":"My first time at Ocotillo (take out, actually) and it was honest to goodness drop dead delicious.  I had the cauliflowerveg dish and the small plate chicken meatballs.  The crazy intense blends of veggies, herbs, peppers, magic, I don't even know what -- which surrounded the main event were to DIE for.  I had recently spoken with a top Phoenix chef who recommended Ocotillo as one of the best places in the area and I was SO impressed.  Only drawback was that online menu did not match current availability so I had to scramble when ordering via phone.  But seasonal is always best and what I got instead of what i'd planned to was AMAZing.  I'm a food snob, I don't give these high praises easily and am not affiliated in any way.  100% recommended"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to checking this place out since I'd heard great things from friends. Unfortunately, my experience didn't match up with theirs at all. I show up to lunch with my friend at around 2 PM and was happy to see it wasn't super full, we were quickly seated on the patio as requested and began to enjoy the sun and cool breeze. That was great and all, but we then waited for a full twenty minutes for our waitress to introduce herself, and that was only after we went inside to ask if someone would come take our order. Initially we wondered why a group of 4 guys abruptly left without ordering, but had I been there on my workday and looking to get lunch during my break, I would have done the same. She finally came and was nice enough, but seemed very disconnected. Thankfully, the food saved the day. The falafel burger was one of the best I've had. I'd give the food 4 stars, but the service was abysmal. Hence the 2 stars."}
{"text":"This is my second or third trip to Ocotillo, the other times were also for brunch. I really want to give this place 5 stars: the food is creative and fresh (and I suspect local as possible), the coffee is darn good & the cocktails & wine list looks solid, yet, fun. Today I had the Octotillo Bowl for brunch. A bowl of farro with pistachio pesto, pickled peppers, bacon, arugula and 2 over easy eggs. What a tasty and unique combination, it was wonderful! As I said, the coffee was really good (I am a coffee snob, blame my parents). The issue? Service & facilities.  Our server was nice, personable, and quick to make recommendations. The problem? Timing or cadence; we had to request our coffee refills (the first time) from a server who was refilling waters because he disappeared. Later, when I asked for salt & pepper, I was halfway through my meal before he brought it. And finally, it took around 20-25 minutes for my dining companions credit cards to be returned after they sent them off with the bills. That made my friends nervous (understandably). It's a serious trust issue. Our server thought he'd already returned the cards, he said! Then there was the facilities, left behind clothes hanger, and broken toilet seats?? I get it at 1 am on a Saturday night but Sunday morning? Not cool. I think perhaps a little more policing could be done. I hope I can change this to 5 stars, this is otherwise an awesome, spacious, sprawling place with great food & beverages."}
{"text":"We had the best time at Ocotillo. Great Food, Great Wine, Great Patio and Great Staff.   We loved dinner so much we went back the next morning for brunch!   David Johnson spent some time at our table and was really a pleasure. The food is innovative, fresh, and delicious, and the wine selections well chosen and reasonably priced.   We spend a couple of months in the Phoenix area every winter and Ocotillo is now on my list for sure!"}
{"text":"In the last month I have been to Ocotillo for brunch, lunch and dinner.  Tough to say which menu I liked best!  It is one of those restaurants you know you need to go back to because there are so many interesting things on the menu it is hard to decide what to order.   It is a beautiful property and the patio looks like a fun place to sit once it cools off   The staff was efficient, and knowledgeable and gave good advice on the menu.  A friend I took to dinner said Ocotillo is now her new favorite restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great food, atmosphere and staff except for the host. He was so rude! Loved our waiter and all the other servers!  The food was great! The patio was also great and well lit and heated."}
{"text":"The architecture is beautiful. Other than that I would generally take a pass on going again. The food was good, but nothing I couldn't make at home or get elsewhere. I ordered the brisket sandwich. I ate maybe a quarter of the massive slab of meat on the open bread. I left the rest because the remaining meat was pure fat. I expect some fat on brisket but not nearly the entire sandwich. Fortunately some yummy fries were included so I didn't go hungry.  My group also ordered the roasted cauliflower for a starter. It was very good and wished I ordered that as my main meal instead."}
{"text":"Update: Giving one more star as someone (they didn't identify their position) from Ocotillo responded to my review right way. They addressed the menu changes (I certainly understand that restaurants do this) and photos, and that I did have prosciutto, they cut it to resemble bacon. What they didn't address was the long wait for our meal and that it wasn't hot. Also that grilled bread is a personal like/dislike and sorry that I didn't enjoy it. Well I've had grilled bread before and I do like it, but not cold! They invited me to come back to get a better impression of the restaurant. Thank you for your offer, but my husband and I will pass."}
{"text":"My husband and I are familiar with Sacha Levine's cooking from her days at FnB. We were eager to try out her newest venture in central Phoenix. The huge space is really eye-catching, and I can't wait for it to warm up just a bit more so we can dine outside.  We've been twice so far, for brunch and dinner. We came at slower times so we didn't encounter any service issues. Our food came out quickly and piping hot both visits.  For brunch, my husband got the steak, eggs and potatoes which he absolutely loved. The flavorful steak was cooked perfectly, and the potatoe hash thing on the side looked sinful. I thought it was a great value for $20. He wasn't that happy with the cabbage salad however. I liked it ok but thought it could use a little punching up. My falafel burger was good but needed way more dressing and/or pickles. When I had the leftovers at home the next day, I liked it even more with extra toppings. The fries on the side were absolutely divine.   Our dinner visit was with friends. We started with the roasted cauliflower which was decent but below my expectations. Our dining companions loved the ribeye steak and pork tenderloin (from the small plates). Their daughter and I both had pasta dishes, and I was impressed with the homemade pasta. My little shells were dotted with kale and goat cheese and swimming in a squash sauce that wasn't too heavy on the cream.  I was absolutely stuffed and couldn't stomach any desserts. I can't wait to try them out with some coffee on my next visit."}
{"text":"Just came for happy hour with some friends. We sat in the beer garden and enjoyed great food,  weather,  and service from Cole. The burger was amazing and I would strongly recommend the cauliflower. It was perfect! Love ocotillo and can't wait to come back soon!"}
{"text":"There was a group of 18 of us who called ahead and scheduled a reservation for our friend's birthday.  The hostess we spoke to, Erin, was incredibly helpful and professional.  The hostess when we arrived didn't even have to look down at her notes when we arrived; she was expecting us and pointed us to our table.  Wow!  The aesthetic, drinks, and food were all fantastic.  Our server, Eli, was incredible to us the entire evening, offering great recommendations and was funny and generously accommodating to our large party.  The staff graciously allowed us to store an ice cream cake for our friend's birthday surprise.  It was a tremendous evening, and all of us ordered at least one drink and an entree, and we ordered multiple appetizers for the table.  The one major disappointment given the tremendous treatment we received all night came from the manager, Steve.  (He didn't introduce himself or welcome us, unlike everyone else working last evening.)  Toward the beginning of our night, he came over and reprimanded us for having an unopened bottle of wine *in a gift bag* along with the other gifts for our friend at the end of the table.  Nobody was even close to attempting to open the gift, but Steve felt the need to instruct us not to be idiots.  (We had already ordered two pitchers of tasty sangria and multiple delicious cocktails.)  He then informed us that storing cakes were reserved for \"special events\" (like the large birthday party we had reserved ahead of time, I wonder?), but that we could go ahead and enjoy our cake anyway.  Thanks, Steve.  Despite this manager putting a MAJOR buzz kill in our opening round of drinks, we had a lovely time the rest of the night, and really enjoyed the rest of the atmosphere that Ocotillo has to offer.  We will be back soon.  We hope to see the sangria, the pasta, the hostesses, the servers (especially our boy Eli!) again.  Let's hope Steve has the night off."}
{"text":"Great vibe, service and concept. Love the food and drinks. Everything is great, especially the brunch!"}
{"text":"This place is a little off the beaten path but worth a trip! I've been here about 4 times and the food and service have been consistently good. Today I met up with friends for Saturday brunch. I ordered the sheep's milk ricotta dish and the wild mushroom quiche and both were excellent. The ricotta was blended with a little bit of chopped basil and topped with balsamic, sun-dried strawberries, and honey, and served with grilled bread. The quiche was delicious as well and came with a nice side salad.    As far as drinks, if you like fresh ginger, try the Pimm's Cup - my friend ordered one and I stole a taste. I'm not a big gin person but the ginger and citrus perfectly balanced out the cocktail. Two of us also both ordered the Nutella Coffee Boba to drink. I had ordered it on a previous visit and enjoyed it--it had come with a good amount of boba and the (boba-mandatory!) extra-wide straw. Today however they were served to us with small straws, and the boba in both of our drinks were kind of all stuck together. After we pointed these issues out to our waiter he handled it great, though; after he couldn't find any large straws anywhere, he took the two boba drinks off our bill.   If your party is up for sharing food, I think a lot of the items on the brunch menu (including the ricotta dish I got today, or the stuffed dates I had on a previous visit) would be great tapas-style (or even as \"brunch appetizers,\" if that's a thing). One friend I was with today got the avocado & tomato toast which would also be good shared--though maybe I'm just saying that because it looked super tasty & I was definitely eyeing it--I'll have to get it next time!"}
{"text":"Dinner with a party of 6 was awesome.  The appetizer with strawberries and buratta cheese and balsamic vinegar was awesome as was the pasta dish with fresh tomatoes and the ocotillo chicken was smashingly good.  Good flavors, good service, fair prices.  I'd definitely check it out."}
{"text":"My main thought when visiting Ocotillo for this first time, this past weekend, was that they could be doing so much more. The outdoor space is beautiful, you feel tucked away and definitely not like you're on the corner of 3rd St and Osborn. But it was a bit boring. Albeit I did go in with high expectations, I just felt it needed more atmosphere, younger people, maybe even some outdoor activities, having the outdoor bar open, etc. More of a \"The Yard\" style, but with a little more class. The massive outdoor space seems wasted. Our food was delicious, staff was knowledgeable and we had some good beers. We shared the picnic table style seating with a party of four seniors, the place just was not nearly as \"fun\" as I was anticipating. Maybe brunch is better?  Great food, great drinks, would go back, but not for what I was looking for on Friday night.  -------------------------------------------  Update: I updated my review from three to four stars after multiple return visits to Ocotillo. It really is a great spot for brunch, large groups, and dates. Just wasn't what I was looking for that first night and I still think a few bar games would be a good idea ;)"}
{"text":"The ambiance is great. We sat inside at a community table, plenty of room, we weren't on top of each other at all. We asked our server, Milan, to order for our party. So happy we did that. Persian cucumbers, shiitake mushrooms, fresh pasta with braised lamb and a whole crispy fish. OH EM GEE. Order it all. Delicious and perfect. We also had a few Old Fashioneds, very tasty. We had wonderful service, Milan is great. The manager greeted us and made sure we were taken care of. We will definitely be coming back to enjoy Ocotillo again!!"}
{"text":"Beautiful, relaxed setting. The menu is artful and sophisticated, with a wide variety of dishes, and reasonably priced! Every dish is beautifully presented too. We had the grapefruit brûlée (a while fruit, not just half, perfect to share), hash, cauliflower and raw farm veggies. MORE than enough food and all fresh, delicious and interesting. We can't wait to get back and try more of the menu. Good service today as well!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here and I really liked the food. Our waiter was decent and made suggestions from the menu. However, I did not like some of the other staff. A larger man with white hair and dark glasses dropped a 2nd cauliflower at our table, that we did not order. We tried to get his attention but he just walked off. We moved the dish to another location for it was in the way. In my experience at other restaurants if they accidentally give you an item they let you keep it for the have to throw it away....well this same man came to the table and picked it back up, without saying a word. He then took the dish back to the kitchen and then promptly came back out with the cauliflower dish. He walked by our table and stated \"its good but not that good to have a 2nd\" and then went and placed that dish at another table. I don't know for sure but I think it was the same one at our table. Just because of this person I will not go back...it also took a long time for water refills."}
{"text":"Ocotillo delivers on freshness of ingredients, atmosphere, service, and diversity of menu. As a lone diner in a place with shared options on the menu I was a little nervous I wouldn't be able to find anything...I was dead wrong! I tried my best to pair complimentary dishes with the grilled corn and halibut ceviche. The grilled corn came with 2 ears smothered in a spicy aioli, jalapeños, crispy coconut strips, and cilantro. Everything paired well together. My only complaint would be to serve the ears with \"holders\". It was a bit of a mess without them. The halibut ceviche was a major highlight! Fresh halibut, crispy quinoa, avocado, red onion, cilantro, and corn nuts. The freshness of the halibut with the overall texture profile knocked this dish out of the park. This would be perfect for a light meal or app. Ocotillo is worth your time, any night, for any reason."}
{"text":"I went to Ocotillo for the first time a week ago and was very disappointed. We were seated after a short wait (although there were no other people waiting and the restaurant wasn't full). We were then forgotten about completely. No one came to offer us drinks or take our order so I got up and asked the first employee I saw.  He apologized and immediately helped us. Unfortunately, he didn't seem to be very knowledgeable about vegan options so I had to ask him to clarify with the chef, as most places usually do. When he returned he told me the options and modifications I can make so we went with the roasted cauliflower and falafel burger.  After I got the cauliflower I noticed a green looking pesto, which I presumed contained cheese. He said they would use a carrot pesto so I was alarmed when it was not orange. So I let the dish get cold as I waited for him to come by so that I could ask. Well, he didn't come by for quite a while so I got up and asked the hostess--who happened to be vegan--what color it was supposed to be, she said orange.  I go back to my table and wait some more until our waiter finally comes by again and says that it's a carrot TOP pesto and that it's supposed to be green and the hostess didn't know what she was talking about.  At this point my cauliflower is cold but to be honest it was nothing special. I make better roasted cauliflower at home. It was pretty though. Too lemony for me. The falafel burger--when made vegan--is too dry so we added avocado but it still was dry.  And let's talk about the decor: BORING! White walls, bright lights?! It was a little \"old\" for us. We won't be returning and don't really recommend it to others.   P.s. Drinks were okay."}
{"text":"Came back in after our visit 2 weeks ago. While this days Chef took some creative license on our two faves, the day was saved by our server Sharlie.   Sharlie was over the moon in her genuine concern for us to find satisfaction. And while it was not to be on this day, her robust emotional intelligence was effusive and real. She tried every which way to hook us on finding something which might work.  So we give her 10 points for her effort and 5 points to the Manager who hired her. For this reason alone, we will return and be sure to lean in on a day she is present."}
{"text":"Had lunch with a friend at Ocotillo.  There is only good to say.  The restaurant, inside and out, is great looking and I am sure will be place for great times and memories.  My friend and I both had the hamburger with fries.  Simply done but so good--I asked for fries well done and they listened.  The menu provides lots of options for everyone from vegetarian to carnivore.  Service was well paced and helpful without being intrusive.  Looking forward to another visit soon."}
{"text":"Enjoyed some good food in outside patio on Sunday morning. Really loved beet veggie dish and I loved my drink. I wasn't big fan of salmon but my sister really liked house salmon! My fiancé got the overnight oatmeal and it was yummy! Overall great experience!"}
{"text":"So I walk in and this place is great! Menu looks amazing. Then I learn they have nothing for kids and we have to leave. They couldn't even make a grilled cheese. Too bad it's not more friendly for families.  We will have to come back but this time get a sitter for the kids. They are really missing out on a lot of revenue. Sad."}
{"text":"Ocotillo is fantastic. The atmosphere is fantastic a fun design with beautiful outdoor seating. The only reason they are not getting 5 stars is they undercooked the ribeye- but better undercook than over - and- they didn't have the two wines I wanted to order. However the clams and pork belly was delicious although know the pork has a smoky flavor. The pastas are fresh made. I highly recommend the burrata pasta- the burrata is light and the sauce is thicker and has a tiny bite to it- it's a fabulous combination."}
{"text":"What an awesome restaurant! The drinks were great - try the \"Unicorn Tears\"! The menu was unreal. We had the cauliflower to start. So good. And then I had the homemade pasta and meatballs. So tasty. My friend had the falafel burger and she loved it. We were too stuffed for dessert but I saw the chocolate tart and will get that next time. Awesome local restaurant. Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"I originally really enjoyed the idea of this place because the food was different and good (while a bit too pricey).  Because of the nice outdoor area, you would think it wasn't as pricey or that they would welcome after work people at the picnic tables after work.  I went with a large group after work.  Unfortunately, there isn't any type of reasonably priced appetizers or happy hour.  I spent a ridiculous amount of money and unfortunately others were soured on it.  Go for real dinner but NOT for any type of after work or happy hour.  It is a bit pricier than it probably needs to be as well."}
{"text":"I been here several times but the last to times I asked for a brisket the server told us is only on weekends so there I go again on a weekend and the server told me oh is been off the menu for almost 2 months I say I was just here on Monday they told me only on weekends you had this dish anyways the coffee was terrible it tasted like a drip of dirty water  Before my 2 last visits this place was one of my Top favorites To visit"}
{"text":"Great food and service, our friend wanted to try it out so we drove over 30 min from Scottsdale and it's so worth drive.  We had a total of 4 dishes: fried lobster, octopus, crispy duck confit and ribs.  Every single one was super tasty.  Definitely coming back to try out their other dishes."}
{"text":"We came for an early dinner on a Saturday around 5:00 pm and were a little disappointed that they were only serving small plates and vegetables.  We stayed and ordered from those choices.  The food was very good.  Our server was not great for the price point of the food.  There is an extremely large back patio that is gorgeous.  A wedding was taking place though so we sat on a small patio by the main road.  It was noisy but such a nice night out.  There was a large dog at a table next to us that kept wandering over by our table.  My dinner partner did not appreciate this."}
{"text":"Perhaps a busy Saturday for lunch is not the best time to visit this place. They only have a brunch menu which is limited. We got a nice table on the patio, but our server seemed distracted. We ordered a salad to split to start. My husband ordered a burger cooked medium, and I got the falafel sandwich. The salad and his burger came together. There was no extra plate to help with splitting the salad. Our server didn't come back to check, so we couldn't ask him. My husband's burger was very dry and cooked well done. My sandwich showed up about 10 minutes later and was also very dry. Our water glasses were never refilled. We did order wine and it took awhile but was OK. After our pleasant 1st visit, this one was disappointing."}
{"text":"This place is an absolute charm. The atmosphere is a little loud and it is to be expected. The seats are close together but being from New York City, this is quite common. Actually like the idea of putting our name in and being texted when the table was ready.  We had time to visit the bar. The bartender was great but not fast. We took our drinks out to the patio and sat under the stars awaiting our text. We noticed a lot of people smiling and a lot of people enjoying the atmosphere. It's nice, casual, fun. When our table was ready, we are pleased to hear it was outside and there was a heater available to us.   The food was delivered and was absolutely amazing. I started with the roasted cauliflower. It was a mixture of flavors that typically one would not place together. However they make it work and work well. I then had the pork sugo  which was superb.   I would recommend this place to the locals and  anyone wanting to come to midtown went evening. It's not too far from the Osborne light rail."}
{"text":"Decided to give Ocotillo another try, and although the ambiance and overall decor concept is undoubtedly hip; the service and food were equally as lackluster as our first experience.  We had a 15-person reservation for a friend's birthday at 830pm. It took 20+ minutes for a server to take our initial drink order, and the service was consistently as bad throughout our entire meal.  The food is OK. The Roasted Cauliflower had to be sent back to the kitchen when it arrived to the table cold. However, once it was above room temperature, the flavors tasted delicious. Also ordered the Crispy Falafel Burger - good!  Make sure you have at least 3 choices for wine because they're likely to be out of a couple of them.  Would love to see this place get better!"}
{"text":"Loved everything about this whole place!  Loved my salad, but really loved the facility, and all it's hidden places!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! The ocotillo chicken was to die for and would definitely get again. The service was prompt and attentive. Ambiance was fantastic. Definitely coming back :)"}
{"text":"Enjoyed everything about my experience here! The cocktails were delicious, and the homemade pasta with some of the best I've had in Phoenix. Which is weird considering it's not an Italian restaurant. I definitely consider cooking Italian food my specialty courtesy of my upbringing, and I've really struggled to find a place with good homemade pasta here in the valley. We also ordered a fantastic watermelon salad as well as spicy seared scallops. It was all delicious and the ambience on the outdoor patio is lovely with a great view."}
{"text":"This. This is exactly what I want when I come home. So quintessentially Arizonan. Lovely outdoor space with picnic style seats and loungey sofas. The space is courtyard style so you feel totally encapsulated and are surrounded by desert landscaping, concrete, rust and wood. Part coffee stand, part restaurant, part outdoor lounge.  The sheep's milk ricotta small plate was SO GOOD. Sun dried strawberries? What? Plus our server was nice and gave us an extra basket of that grilled bread.   We also got the fried zucchini, simply because it came with burrata and my sister and I are addicts. Thankfully it was good here (I am ever amazed at the poor quality of burrata out there).  We drank craft beer and sat in the sunshine and ate good food. Man, I miss AZ. Thank you Ocotillo, from the bottom of my heart, for this lovely lunch on my last day in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Today was the second time here. We walked away the first time because it's so damn noisy. My son was with us today ....so when we arrived he asked the hostess for a quieter spot to sit. She sat us on the north side patio, which was so much nicer.Corben, our server was efficient with great service. The menu is short and sweet. This tells me food is fresh. I had the brisket with polenta. Very tasty, the presentation was excellent on all dishes at our table. I must say though.......the lemonade was amazing!!!!! We were all satisfied with what we ate. This isn't your ordinary restaurant, all in all satisfying."}
{"text":"This is an excellent lunch venue that will not disappoint if you are looking to spend the money. The drinks and food were very delicious."}
{"text":"I have been to Ocotillo for dinner and brunch and have loved every visit! The atmosphere and food are both fantastic. Try the vegetable dishes, they are always my favorite!"}
{"text":"Really good food options and ample seating both inside and out. The architecture and landscape is very sleek, simple, and modern, with great design elements. I appreciate the outdoor space and seating options here. And the food is delicious so you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Loved the vibe as soon as we got there! It was such a beautiful day when we went, 70s in April/May? You can't beat that!! So we decided to sit outside. They first showed us to the front patio area which felt a little crammed. On my way to the  bathroom, I saw the back patio area with community tables and that had a much better feel. We then asked to be seated in one of their picnic tables -- more spacious, better vibe. There was another couple on the other end of the table but it didn't feel like we were in each other's bubble.   We decided to share the avocado toast and the ribeye. The avocado toast was a little bland, it needed a little bit more salt, I just expected a little more flavor. The ribeye though, it was huge!!! And packed with flavor, it came with hashbrowns and fried egg, arugula and a red wine sauce and wow -- everything together just heaven in your mouth. For that price and that huge steak, I'd definitely come back. I noticed a lot of people ordered the cauliflower, that's something I'd probably try next time.   The reason I docked one star was the service. I felt like I barely saw our waiter, he barely checked on us or refilled my water. Also, he charged my bfs beer wrong, twice. Other than that, it was a perfect Saturday spent! We enjoyed the food, the ambience and the dogs playing around!"}
{"text":"what a GEM! visiting my hometown from Alaska, and what a gorgeous restaurant! aesthetically, beautiful,  the light gently illuminated from the copper accents, creating a warm inviting entrance, we wanted to sit on the gorgeous patio, its spring in Phoenix!!!  but sadly, could not, the hostess graciously sat us at a booth, received fantastic service from a David and a Nicole, started with the raw sheeps  cheese and honey, AMAZING, then shared the salad with Gem lettuce and house made bleu cheese, and avocados,  the entree was a beautiful moist, tangy, Ocotillo Chicken, with pecan potato salad. Best meal and service I have had on my vacation. well done. well done."}
{"text":"Food,  atmosphere and service were great.  Our server Josh is awesome. I will definitely going back and will try different menu and cocktails."}
{"text":"Seeing how Ocotillo is central to my job and home, I visit here often.  I have had many items from each of the menus. The prices, given the portion sizes, are very fair.  BRUNCH/LUNCH: I recommend the Brisket (OH MY GAWD!), the avocado toast, either quiche, honey chicken sandwich, arugula salad, cauliflower (personal favorite), zucchini (my other personal favorite), farm veggie plate, fish and chips, ricotta/strawberries and grilled bread, pork sausage sandwich  DINNER: Butternut squash pasta!   SPECIAL EVENTS: LAMB! (Hot damn, the lamb!)  Coffee bar: Excellent! The girls in there are friendly, professional, fast and the coffee and tea selection is very nice. It is wonderful to get a break from corporate Starbucks! The universal love is strong in there!   Atmosphere: I typically eat outside. It is just too beautiful of a spot to eat indoors. However, with it being cooler now, I have eaten inside. I find that I can carry a conversation or take care of business whilst waiting for my order. It's clean. It's open.   Service: I am always served and seated in a timely manner. However, I am not there during a lunch or dinner rush. Once, I did not enjoy my sandwich. The salmon was intentionally served cold and I expected it to be served hot. It was taken care of with out a problem. My food has been consistently delicious.   Constructive Criticism: I would love for there to be coat/purse hooks and a baby changing station in the restrooms. No one wants to set anything valuable, such as a fine leather bag or, say, a baby, on a restroom floor.   With all this said, saddens me to see such mixed reviews as I have only had the best of experiences and/or my not so great experiences are always handled with great care. I foresee Ocotillo becoming a much needed gem in this neighborhood. I'd hope that those who have written concerning their less than favorable experiences would return to find themselves receiving top-notch food and service, just as I have."}
{"text":"Wow. Tonight was my first night here and I am astonished about how amazing everything was. The food, the ambience, the drinks, and the server. Josh and Hayden, as well as the rest of the staff went above and beyond to compensate our party of 15. Thank you so much Ocotillo for everything tonight.   Cheers!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Went in with a friend and was seated pretty promtly. I likes that they weren't too busy, not but a couple of 8 tops. However as thirty min approached and I saw that the next people to be seated had already gotten a drink order in, right next to us without anyone even coming to my table, I found it right to walk out. Really wanted to eat there but was overlooked the entire time."}
{"text":"Flawless amazing meal. Food, service, ambiance all first rate. Owner and sommelier David came around a couple of times to make sure all was great. Hey, that rhymes!"}
{"text":"I've been to this new spot 4 times already...each time it was really yummy, fun and cool. I've had brunch there and dinner and happy hour. Staff is really friendly. One time the server couldn't stop telling me I looked like someone famous and she asked me to take a photo with her. (?!) That cauliflower dish is AMAZING...I order it EVERY TIME i am there. It is truly amazingly awesome. I do think the veggie dishes a bit better more flavorful than the dinner entrees. I had a pasta dish once that lacked a bit of flavor (for me.) Can't wait to take my family here for brunch during the weekend. Love the grassy, open places."}
{"text":"I'll be honest in stating that I knew nothing about Ocotillo before dining there. (I didn't do my research - AKA Yelp \"homework.\") But I'm glad it worked out that way, because from cocktails to dessert, I was surprised, impressed and delighted over and over.  Our group dinner had a heavy assortment of apps, salads, entrees and desserts, but for me the Cauliflower appetizer was everything! This steak-ey cut of cauliflower tastes as thought it was bathed in lemon juice (and zest) - which is a good thing, because I am crazy bunny boiler fan of lemon. With other flavors of mint, basil, kale, and peanuts, it's beyond perfection and I would easily order this as my main entree next time. The Carrot Fatoush Salad (particularly with the creamiest feta I've ever tasted) was a close second, followed by the bruschetta-like toast topped with fried sunchokes and crispy brussels sprouts. I can't seem to find this item on any of their menus, so perhaps it was a night's special - or made especially for us.   Pastas are made in-house, ribs were a hit at the table, and brunch is rumored to be a must. Oh, and service is outstanding.   As for the massive layout - the each nook and area has its own vibe, offering something completely different in the various seating areas. And there are plenty! Inside dining, bar seating, patio seating, lounge seating, fire pits, a grassy knoll, outside bar ... event an adjacent coffee and pastry bar across the patio.   I'm not sure when I'll return to Phoenix, but if I do I'll head straight over to Ocotillo."}
{"text":"I've been to Ocotillo several times and am definitely a fan.  The ambiance is phenomenal with options to suit any mood.  Some areas are rather intimate and quiet and other areas are better suited for your party mood -- i.e. a bit louder and more fun.  It's a bit of a modern, somewhat upscale atmosphere with a patio that will definitely be appreciated during periods of amazing Arizona weather.    The food, I must say, is very, very solid.  One of my favorite places in town for interesting, good, solid food.  The menu is super creative with options for just about everyone.  Everything I've had at Ocotillo has been excellent, so it's hard to nitpick about anything.  You cannot go wrong with the Ocotillo Chicken, a couple pieces of bone-in roasted chicken with a delicious chili citrus glaze.  It's delicious.  And the Branzino for 2 is a whole fish that has tons of flavor - a soy/tamarind sauce, as I recall.  For appetizers, I've had the grilled octopus, the smoked beets, the crispy chicken meatballs and the roasted cauliflower.  All were delish!    The only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is that, for me, the service has been a bit hit-or-miss.  The last time we were there, our waiter was a little too casual (i.e. absent and inattentive) in making sure our needs were met.  We were a larger group and the group wanted to drink, but we had to wait for what seemed like an inordinate amount of time to get our waiter's attention and order some cocktails.  On balance, though, my experiences at Ocotillo have been really positive, so I'd give this place 4.5 stars if given the option."}
{"text":"This place should be reclassified to a three star price denomination. Though very very good food. Come fancy. And come with reservation. And get the ribs. Yum"}
{"text":"Such great food and even better service!!!! If you go here ask for Macallister to be your server. He knows the menu and has great recommendations! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"At a glance, this restaurant is superb! I went during the night and there was a forest of illuminating trees. Bordering the outdoor dining area including a fireplace. While being seated indoors for a fairly large party, the area was clean, modern and attractive. Probably one of my favorites. Josh helped recommend wine before we ordered and also helped us choose our plates as well. We ordered the pasta with chicken ragu, a filet minion served in a charcuterie board, two orders of beef ribs, a chicken dish, wings, and a squash soup. That sounds like a lot but we all finished it cause we don't play. Every plate had such a unique flavor that we all enjoyed. I'll definitely be coming back here and aiming during the day time for brunch menu! Josh was an amazing help!"}
{"text":"Tried this newer restaurant this week for happy hour with my friend.  The HH menu was great but more importantly, the food was AWESOME!!  Ordered the meatballs and the sweet potatoes with fennel.  The flavors and sauces were great.  I would love to see what dinner brings!  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"excellent service! great atmosphere and awesome food! I will definitely come back for  brunch!  I had the flautas they were amazing"}
{"text":"This place looks impressive as you walk in. The ambiance is nice and welcoming. We were promptly greeted and sat. Our server was friendly and quick. Food came out shortly. I had the ribeye with eggs and potato cake. The potatoes were a bit bland and under seasoned; the eggs were cooked just right. The ribeye, the star of the plate, however, was highly over salted and over cooked. We also ordered the brisket, polenta and eggs which were just ok. A little on the fatty side and tough, also a little salty. The polenta was good but the jus on the plate broke down the creaminess. Lastly we had the pound cake which tasted good but was fairly dry.   Overall, a lot of nearly good items. I'd be willing to try again with different items, but my expectations will be set a bit lower. This place has potential to be awesome!"}
{"text":"Tasteless food, in a tasteless ambiance with uneducated servers.   I think this another one of those trendy restaurants who's trying to \"change the taste buds of the American eaters\". They are trying to hard at the cost of good old American food.   Bastardizing food classic in hopes of getting press is not my way of building a long lasting restaurant clientele.   With hundreds of great restaurant choices in the valley, I see no reason to ever come back here."}
{"text":"Creativity abounds and the setting is superb. Had brunch with friends and really can't say enough about the food, the drinks, and the service. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Ocotillo was love at first site for me. My husband and I had an amazing brunch experience this past Saturday. The architecture of this place is very cool, they have a huge yard with a coffee bar and bar with lots of community tables, it's a great outdoor space. We opted to sit inside since it's still a little warm. We ordered the sheep's milk ricotta dates, grapefruit brûlée, raw farmer's organic veggies and the chimichanga with a nutella boba iced coffee and iced latte with almond milk. Everything tasted wonderful, those dates were to die for! The grapefruit brûlée stood out with the subtle flavors of added mint. The veggies came with a delicious zataar yogurt sauce and pureed eggplant similar to a babaganoush. The chimichanga had a super flavorful fresh tasting green chile sauce with perfectly cooked eggs, broccoli, and chicken. That nutella boba iced coffee was pretty amazing and my iced latte was great too. I can't wait to come back and eat my way through this menu. My only complaint was that the DJ who was playing awesome music was a bit too loud. We had a hard time having a conversation and ordering due to the decibel, other than that this place was great!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is relaxing and open.  The staff, very friendly and the food and drinks top it all off for an excellent experience. 4.5 stars all the way!"}
{"text":"Wow!! A beautiful place, wonderful service and food.   I agree the cauliflower looks really good, will have to try. Salads, sandwiches and vegan friendly menu.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We have now eaten brunch, lunch and dinner here. Each visit was more amazing that the last. Beautiful decor, great service, and out of this world food! Try the mole ribs and you can die happy. We will return again and again. Highly recommended, 5 stars!!!"}
{"text":"The food, the wine, the server ... all top notch. The ambiance? The dining room's a little too bright. When I order wine, I feel like someone's going to ask, \"Where were you the night of January 10th?!\" My mom likes to call this vibe: spotlight on the creep.  It's ok. The food is worth an interrogation, and if someone does try to frame you for a murder that night, you'll have an excellent alibi. Everyone will definitely be able to say they saw you dining at Ocotillo.  As far as the food goes, I have two words for you: mole ribs.   Ok, three: mole beef ribs.  They are so good, you might kill for them. Which defeats the purpose of coming here for an alibi. If you're prone to killing, best just to stay away."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to brunch in the entire state of AZ. David, Eli and Clay all make the customer experience amazing and fun. The food is seasonal and always incredible. They have a dog friendly outdoor patio which is always a plus. This place is great for any occasion, girls brunch, hot date, or if you want to take yourself on a great date. Whatever. It's the best. I'll follow this place and staff til the end"}
{"text":"Had dinner tonight at the bar.  Bartender mixed a great first cocktail.  Stacey helped us decide on wine and entrees.  Her recs were spot on.  Great service, on time, friendly, patient , and smart.  I had the short rib ravioli.  The best ravioli I ever tasted.  I think ravioli can be very boring.  Not this ravioli.  It was a flavor burst of euphoria in my mouth!  Amazing...I know ...I know...it really was that good.  The ingredients were perfect together.  My friend had the short rib papardelle and I tasted it.  Delicious!  Try it.  Been here before and we will be back again."}
{"text":"Oy.  I really tried Ocotillo, I really did.  But I just couldn't find enough to overcome the downsides I experienced here.  The venue is great, the location is great, the people are great.  But the food and prices were pretty much a disappointment across the board for me.  Admittedly, most of those I've spoken to who think highly of Ocotillo haven't been here for dinner.  The only ones I've spoken to personally have been here for weekend brunch and rave about it.   Maybe that's the ticket I'm missing out on.  In any event, I'll lay out the facts of my experience here on Wednesday after work and you can judge for yourself.  Located on the east side of 3rd Street between Thomas and Osborn (next to China Chili), Ocotillo has all the makings of a fantastic gathering space.  The main restaurant sits right up against 3rd Street while a separate coffee shop and open air beer garden occupy the east side of the premises.  I've heard some comparisons made to The Yard and its open air setup and that's a somewhat fair comparison, though Ocotillo's is more open to the elements in summer.  The modern copper trim design of the building is quintessential Phoenix and there's great energy when you walk inside the restaurant.  I came here with a buddy for dinner and drinks after work, interested to see what caught my attention on the menu  The overwhelming majority of items are $10 or more (including the appetizer menu) so I figured I'd be getting some fairly hefty portions with a three course meal.  Before the food, I grabbed a couple of drinks.  First, the \"#1\" cocktail.  Lemon juice, Demerara Syrup, Angostura Bitters, sage, and pineapple vodka.  Nice refreshing and slightly sweet cocktail.  I also got the national cocktail of Brazil.  The Caipirinha.  Sugar, lime, and sugarcane liquor.  A true classic.  Nothing but positives for the drinks.  Now let's get to the food.  I started with the Asparagus vegetable plate.  The asparagus is steamed and covered in hazelnuts, shaved Pecorino Romano cheese, sea salt, and a fried egg.  It also comes with a side of sauce that tasted kind of like a cross between thousand island and onion dip.  The dish was okay, but I didn't care much for the sauce and quite frankly the portion size was small enough that $13 seems like a pretty steep price.  For my entree I decided to take a crack at the Bucatini Pasta.  Big thick bucatini noodles covered with meatballs made of pork and ricotta, greens, garlic, and a dried tomato paste.  The meatballs were good and the portion was adequate, but honestly this dish was far too dry for me on multiple fronts.  The noodles were dry which didn't mesh well with the dry greens or the dried tomato.  The texture and the flavors were just way off to me largely because there just wasn't a lot in the way of moisture (other than the meatballs).  For dessert, I went with the strawberry shortcake.  I remember making those at home since my youth so I was hoping for a little nostalgia.  The portion size of the shortcake is easily sharable for two.  Unfortunately, just as many of the main ingredients in my entree were dry, the cake part of this dish was super dry.  I get that cake element of shortcake isn't always as moist as other cake batters, but this had no moisture whatsoever.  Had more of a texture of a thick wafer than anything else.  The fruit and ice cream were fine, but the cake part was barely edible to be honest.  Total cost for the food, two drinks, tax and tip came to $85.  Even if you took out the two cocktails I ordered, the total would still came to just over $60.  Truth is, the drinks were the best part of my evening here.  I really can't say I was satisfied with any of the food items I ordered.  Some had good elements, but the execution as a whole was off the mark.  If the high price of a dish renders great quality, then I'll happily pay a little bit more for the privilege (just ask Binkley's).  But based on tonight's visit, I'll probably look upon the dinner menu with a great deal of suspicion if invited here again.  If I ever do find myself here again, maybe I'll do what many of my contacts recommended and just stick to the brunch menu."}
{"text":"Worth every $ spent.  Last visit we got tofu salad, cauliflower, ribeye and toffee cake. Everything was yummy! With plenty drink options.  So far service has been attentive and friendly. Modern ambiance with plenty space outside and inside. Great restaurant if you want to impress clients or a date.   The down side is limited parking.  Currently high up on my favorite restaurants in  Central Phx. If you've never been here, I recommend stopping for dinner and trying the ribeye. Generous portion and extremely delicious!"}
{"text":"What a superb BRUNCH menu!!  I have eaten here for lunch on several occasions and, each time, the food has been excellent (and I've ordered something different each time).  But their brunch, which I had for the first time last weekend, was EXCEPTIONAL!  The flavors are so savory and such unique elements in each dish that make them stand out from many other New American cuisine venues.  It's been quite a while since I've literally been \"wowed\" by a meal, so it was a true delight.  Can't recommend it highly enough!!"}
{"text":"When we arrived at the front door, the hostess took a call immediately after asking if she could help us. We waited. She took another call and kept taking calls. We stood there. She never said \"excuse me\" or anything to indicate she remembered us when finally a gentleman came over and asked if he could help us. I found her to be ill-mannered. We were seated inside. The tables are sort of long and narrow, so to talk you have to sort of quietly yell over the music. The decor is industrial. Our waiter was quite pleasant and we ordered the chili that has brisket and large, fresh tomatoes: it is spicy. It was excellent but they might want to indicate the spice level on the menu. It is a hard place to pair any two items, like soup and salad, that wouldn't take your lunch bill over $25.00. I think they need a fewer lower prices side dishes for pairing. My friend had a green, ice tea that looked good. I had coffee but was never asked if I wanted a refill. The food, however, even at other tables looked really good. It was busy and the outside patio this summer is sure to be a place to be seen. I think they need to refine their service and adjust their menu slightly. It seemed to attract the downtown office crowd...."}
{"text":"What gives an establishment a 5 star rating?  Ambience, service, the food?  How about all of the above.  From the arrival in this amazing neighborhood compound, to the finishing touches of our celebratory dessert.  This was an experience!  So let's take it one at a time.  Outdoor picnic tables, outdoor bar, outdoor TV screens, cozy areas around fire pits.  Then you walk inside to another bar and the indoor restaurant.  Then you are greeted by friendly faces.  Our waitress, Christine, was on point, helpful, knowledgeable and just downright fun.  It happened to be the one year anniversary of Ocotillo so we were treated to an inaugural special of the cap of the rib-eye, a skillet of scrumptious pasta and a skillet of long green beans for the entire table.  The steak was cooked to perfection and we were treated to Walt (the owner/chef) coming to our table to carve and serve.  It literally melted in our mouths.  As my friend so aptly stated \"It's a party in my mouth!  Our dessert sealed the evening, a chocolate explosion of marshmallow, orange and grenache.  I can't wait to go again, in fact, it was decided by our little group that it will be our go to birthday celebration place for all of us and whenever we want to meet for a quick happy hour or drink, this will be our place."}
{"text":"I think the space looks cool. 5 stars for that. Brian Watson the bar back is the shit!"}
{"text":"Loved the concept of the restaurant and it was super cute outside. The food was pretty good and the French fries were amazing. The server was kinda awkward and seemed like he didn't know what he was talking about and took too long to refill drinks."}
{"text":"My husband and I had our Valentine's dinner last year at Ocotillo and had such a great experience we decided to make it an annual event, unfortunately this year was a much different experience and we will not be returning. We made a reservation a few weeks ago for 5:30pm, before they get too busy. When we got to the restaurant and checked-in we were immediately seated, but it was at the table right next to one of the other two couples seated in the restaurant. The restaurant was almost completely empty and they chose to seat us at a table a foot away from another couple, on Valentine's Day. We tried to brush it off thinking they were going to fill up before we left and it was for the efficiency of the evening for the staff, but the next couple that came in was seated on the other side of the restaurant, all by themselves. It was not a great start to the meal which we were then served by someone wearing a zippered hoodie, we were told that a beer we ordered from the menu was no longer available, we were not given the complimentary champagne promised on their website as a Valentine's Day special, and we were basically sharing a table with the couple next to us. I was very disappointed in our experience and we will not be back, especially if this is the kind of service they provide for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Had an awesome Christmas eve dinner.  Food was great service was great.  Very attentive staff really hip layout.  The owner David Johnson extremely personal able and informative.  He was engaging and genuine.  Definitely coming back and bringing friends."}
{"text":"Today, I had the opportunity to experience this restaurant on recommendation from friends of ours.  I was really impressed with the trendy ambience, fancy cocktails, and the diverse food options. Our dining experience was great until a guest in my business party tried to order ranch dressing. Jon, our waiter, joyously informed us that they didn't carry Ranch dressing because this is an \"American restaurant\". I informed him that ranch is, in fact, American. I asked if they had something equivalent. He unapologetically stated no, with a smug smile. I stated that he didn't have to look so happy about it. (hint hint, you don't have to be so rude). He reiterated that the restaurant didn't carry ranch, and that he appreciated that about working there.  The type of service that was provided by this gentleman did not fit the atmosphere of the restaurant. Fortunately for this restaurant, my experience will NOT keep me from coming back because the food and atmosphere was so wonderful, but I definitely would refuse service from this server/bartender in the future."}
{"text":"How have I never been here?! The husband and I were in search of something downtown so we went to Yelp and up popped Ocotillo. Every review was great and every photo looked amazing but the big seller for us was that Iron Skillet Pancake. So we headed on over. It was still nice out so we decided to sit in the Beer Garden. The sun was shining,  misters were full blast, the people outside were all cheerful, and we enjoyed watching it all. We of course had the Iron Skillet Pancake, Mixed Berry Compote, with Powdered Sugar and Maple Syrup. Originally my husband ordered this but we ended up switching 1/2 way because everything was so amazing. I loved that bit of char on the bottom, and how they got that pancake so perfectly fluffy will forever boggle my mind, the sweet compote was the perfect topping. It's funny, when it first came out I thought no way would we get through 1/2. It was so good that there were only about 3 bites left. Had to call it quits. We also ended up with the Breakfast Chimichanga, Scrambled Eggs, Grilled Chicken, Black Beans, Green Chili Sauce, Queso Fresco, and Cilantro. I could put that Green Chili Sauce on an old leather shoe and devour it. The tortilla was perfectly crisp and crunchy. I do have to say the only negative thing about our meal was I only saw 3 little pieces of chicken in the burrito, but it was still delicious and we cleared that plate. As for beverages I am not able to drink right now so I got the Ginger, Mint, Lemonade. Very tart and refreshing that summer day. My husband got the Bloody Marry. Everything is from scratch so it was very chunky. He loved that but some people might not so beware. Speaking of from scratch. They are a seasonal kitchen so also beware that their menu is forever changing to fit what that season brings. I love that. Makes everything taste so fresh. So I cant wait to come back to have cocktails and to enjoy more of their delicious seasonal food."}
{"text":"Wow, there's a new kid on the block, but not all that is new means good, I almost am in shock at my experience when compared to other reviews and opinions I've read so far.  Maybe it's just Sunday's. The Sunday morning service was laughable at best, laugh because I didn't want to cry. I wasn't certain how they handle call aheads, or reservations, it was also a weekend brunch, so I attempted to call ahead to at least ask what the wait looked like. Two calls later and no answer, we were already there and parking, but upon entering the compound that is Ocotillo, I found the lady at the maitre d stand, with a phone just below her left elbow. (Seriously?)  I inquired as to the wait as I put the name in with her and was told just a few minutes, tables were being cleaned now. I guess \"being cleaned\" meant 30 minutes, I must have forgotten my English to English translator, silly me. I was unpleasantly surprised to find 6 or 7 open tables as I was getting seated, and the wait had stacked what appeared to be 4 more parties behind me. At this point my best guess was that there weren't enough staff for a weekend morning to handle guests demands.   I ordered the roast beef and potatoes hash, which came with a sunnyside egg, and after requesting the egg medium, the egg was way undercooked; about 3 minutes under. I tried the roast beef, which was chunks of tough beef, overly chewy and super fatty and the potatoes were large cubes about 1.5inch by 1.5inch, this was not a hash. I had about two bites before deciding to give it back to the server.   As I returned the hash, the server replied with a friendly, can I get you something else in stead, which was kind of her, trying to appease my dislike with a different dish, was helpful on her part but I was short on time and wasn't interested in something else at that point.  The rest of my party all independently came to the conclusion that their meals weren't so amazing as to spend the $$ they're charging here, and the wait was over the top. One of the people in the party tried to order the breakfast chimichanga, which they were out of. Their second choice; scrambled farm eggs, was quite underwhelming. Our party also ordered the bread pudding bowl, which was neither bread pudding, nor was it in a bowl. It was tasty though, and had they called it loaf of gooey cinnamon bread on top of roasted apples with cream, it would have been spot on.  Being as objective as possible after such a poor experience, the server was friendly and tried to resolve my complaint by allowing me to order a different meal and the bread pudding bowl tasted good, but caveat emptor to the person who orders it expecting bread pudding.  I can't say that I'll be back soon, but they do have a to go coffee bar, so if you drink coffee maybe you can grab and go from there on your way to work.  Happy yelping!"}
{"text":"Food was not that good for $$$$. Slow in taking our dinner orders !! Waited forever to get our food once we did order. Waitress was quite snippy !!!! There were 10 of us and none of us were impressed. Wouldn't go back !!!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic brunch! They just opened their doors and this place is packed to the gills! Very hospitable, comfortable, and most of all killer menu/food.  Smoked beets with ricotta & pistachio- phenomenal   Chimichanga- fantastic  Bacon- meh. Not worth ordering, flimsy & didn't  seem to be thicker than Oscar Meyer.  Skillet pancake (special) pretty amazing!   Just go! I. Abt waiters eat through this fantastic menu."}
{"text":"Amazing meal with even more amazing service! First off, the ambiance at Ocotillo is perfect for a romantic date or a sexy gathering with a group of friends. There's indoor and outdoor seating, and from what I saw, the property is fairly extensive. Our group came in for dinner, and I was surprised to learn they do everything from morning coffee bar to brunch to wine to dinner. Rarely do I ever think a venue can do it all, but based off of what I experienced during our dinner, I actually might believe that it's possible at Ocotillo.  We started our dinner with an array of appetizers and each one was more amazing than the last. How you can make roasted cauliflower mind blowing is beyond me, but they managed to pull it off! The carrot fatoush salad made my heart and arteries sing, while a cheese bruschetta dish made my mouth go into shock from sublime happiness. What was more astounding was that most of my side of the table was abstaining from gluten and meat (side note: Which meant more for me! Yay!) but this didn't phase our waiter one bit. He happily swapped out ingredients and helped everyone navigate the menu towards dishes which would work for each of their diets. Oh and he always kept the water and wine glasses full which ensured an even more joyous celebration of friends.   The only one ding in our meal was the pasta, which came highly recommended by our waiter, but I found was too thick and glutenous to chew through. I'd go with the gigantic Fred Flinstone slab of ribs next time if you're into feeling like you're at a jousting competition with King Arthur and Lancelot. You'll see what I mean when you order it! It'll make you feel like it's Christmas and you just got your Red Rider bb gun."}
{"text":"The ambience is great. Too bad they closed the coffee bar. The food and menu is great when the kitchen is running smooth. One of the best places in Phoenix when its good. However, the service has taken a big dive. They need a front of house manager badly. The hostess with the nose ring is extremely rude, but she seems to be the only one who knows what she is doing. Tables are seated without assigned servers. This means waiting 10-20 minutes without drinks or placing food orders. The servers do not know the menu. The servers seem rushed even when the place is empty. The bus boys hover around tables not knowing how to be discrete. The servers do not check in on how you like your food (my last filet was overcooked). The servers no longer ask if you want anything else after your meal (I usually do). They just drop off the check and run away. And the stations are not being stocked. No coffee ready for the brunch crowd last week. All of these problems can be fixed with a good disciplined FOH manager. There are also lots of flies and gnats inside the dining room/kitchen area. That's gross. I will probably give this one more try in a few months hoping things are fixed, but if not then it will lose my business which is too bad because it has been one of the best dining experiences in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. There are many different areas of this place both inside and out...the main restaurant is bright and sleek and the patio is lovely. There is also a grassy area and an area with comfy couches to relax and enjoy the gorgeous fall weather.  I had the chicken dumplings off the small plates menu. They had just enough kick to them to make them interesting. My coworker had the tofu sandwich with fries. We both had the desert which was a layered mousse with Samoa Girl Scout cookies...delicious! I will definitely be back to sample more items from their menu."}
{"text":"Lunch at ocotillo today - fabulous food. I had the special - smoked salmon tartine. Hope they have it again! It's basically an open-faced sandwich of herbed cheese, salmon, avocado, baby yellow beets, bi-color radishes, and thinly sliced kumquats. Just gorgeous. My friend had the salmon sandwich which was also perfect! Thanks for a terrific lunch Ocotillo!"}
{"text":"Great new addition to the neighborhood!  I absolutely love the space and can't wait for this place to extend their hours.  I was surprised that the outdoor space was used a little better to accommodate additional outdoor seating, but maybe that is a work in progress.  The service was friendly and the food came out quite quick.  I thoroughly enjoyed my tandoori chicken sandwich with fries - so tasty!"}
{"text":"The staff and service were great, but I wasn't hugely impressed by the food. I'd love to come back and try Ocotillo for cocktails or brunch, though!"}
{"text":"Have always heard good things about this place and decided to give it a try.  Had the chimichanga which was very filling and delicious.  The rest of my party also enjoyed their food and the sangria was delicious and not watered down either.  Ambience, had a nice picnic feel while we sat outdoors with chill/house music playing.  Waiter was attentive and friendly.  Would def. visit once again!"}
{"text":"I was invited to Ocotillo yesterday for the first time. I was with 4 other people when we walked into the restaurant. Immediately greeted by two young girls at the hostess stand. We exchanged Hello's and one of the girls asked if we had reservations (very short and Curt.) We replied no because if you call Ocotillo they tell you no reservations under 8 people.  Also by  the looks of the place we we're early and there were plenty of empty tables. She continues to be very rude and tells us we need to order from some counter then sit at a table in the back. We walk away very confused and turned off by the way these girls are treating us. As we approached a table out back the other girl from hostess stand comes up behind us and rudely states not these tables! So we look at her baffled and she doesn't proceed to explain any procedures or where exactly we are supposed to go. At this point one of our friends says let's just go. There were plenty of staff standing around that could have stepped in and helped us out. As we are leaving I walked back up to hostess stand and just let them know we felt like we have been treated very poorly. The two girls NEVER apologized one of the girls asked \"your upset cause we don't have a table\"(rude again.) I replied \"No it is your poor customer service, tone and attitude. Attention manger if you want great representation for your restaurant consider who you put at the podium!"}
{"text":"This is a great location/building, and I want so much to like the food and the service, but things just don't seem to be getting any better. They are new, so we wanted to give them a chance to work out some of the kinks, but the food is just bland and effortless. The menu is also annoying. I'm fine with a detailed description of what will be in my dish, but I don't want to have to read out all of the ingredients to place my order. Name your dishes people! Last time we went, I ordered the \"scrambled farm eggs, blue corn tortillas, radishes, queso fresco, avocado, pico de gallo, chile sauce...\" and it was a pile of flavorless mush. The Bloody Mary's have also been pretty disgusting both times I've tried. Again, really wanted to like it, but it would take a lot for me to give it another try at this point."}
{"text":"Because it's a 1 star rate, it's actual a Big FAT ZERO Star.  Why?  I decide to bring my client I thought it was a nice place. it looked nice to have lunch around noon.   It being my first time visiting for both of us, and the outside was nice and such.  I place my order and waiting on my order. I was enjoying my salad and having a good conversation.  I saw my order coming. i ate my small side. the discussions part was, I took a bite out of my sandwich. I noticed human hair in my food, it was gross and I immediately lost my apatite. The sight that kind of questions your decision on coming back and my thought ran through my mind. I felt I shouldn't invited my friends and family to this place if they can't manage the clean food.  Found human hair in my food."}
{"text":"Stay away.  Was there for lunch the other day.  Food took a really long time to come out and when it did, it was not worth the wait.  Both of our salads were really not good.  My dressing was just oil.  When I pointed it out to the waiter, he just said, \"yea, I think it might be broken.  Plaid my bill, and as I was leaving I was watching the kitchen.  One if the cooks took a metal spoon, dipped it into a pot, held it for another cook to taste, then tasted it himself, wiped it off with a rag and stirred the pot with it.  That's right, two of the used the spoon to taste it and kept using it.  Clearly this was acceptable.  Told the manager and he was shocked, but I pointed out all 5 people in the kitchen had seen this happen and no one said anything.  I bet it happens all the time.  No thanks, too many choices in Phoenix."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is cool, urban and casual.  The servers hussle; they're doing the best they can.  The food is above average for the most part and the beer menu is amazing.  I don't know of a lot of places with such a global beer list and they let you keep the pretty bottle if you want (though I forgot mine).    The wings were actually the most disappointing dish we had.  They were not seasoned, grilled and underdone.  Not raw enough to send back but the joints were very tight and red.  They put pickled veggies you'd find on a bahn mi sandwich on top which helped with flavor but quite random and still too bland.  12 bucks for 5 wings - very disappointing.  The calamari camperelle(?) pasta was solid.  It came with some of the best tasting grilled bread I've ever had.  The pasta itself was solid with a creamy tomato sauce.  I'm not sure I'd get it again but I did enjoy the dish.  The ribeye was very different from the typical restaurant steak - actually seasoned with more than salt and pepper!  I think there was pesto on top.  I enjoyed it very much, with the mushroom and/or potato with every bite it was very good.  My friend thought it was too salty though.    The beer list was amazing - the prices seem pretty fair too.  Sure, there's a small up charge but where would you find all these beers outside a beer festival?  Some of the bottles were beautiful - I wanted to take a couple home to use as vases but forgot them.  All in all, I think the pricing is fair and the food is above average.  They have no happy hour or any kind of special so expect to spend at least $20 per person without drinks.  Drinks will add at least 10/person/round (though they did have some ~5 beers like Pabst but.... don't.....)."}
{"text":"The brunch.  Oh my god.  Beautiful seating outdoors in a great space, and the food was exceptional.  The pork flautas were delicious, and the \"pancake\" is definitely big enough for two people (at least).  And then there were the cocktails.  Many hours later we were leaving, but I can't wait to come back.  And Eli the server was great  :-D"}
{"text":"One of my top five restaurants in the Valley.  Their preparation and delivery is always great.  Love their smoked meats and fish and the wine and bourbon selections are top notch."}
{"text":"We went here on a double date night with some good friends who are also foodies, to celebrate the last day of school.  The parking lot was small but as soon as we walked in to the lawn area we were in awe of just the space itself!  Ocotillo's menu is small but packed with quite a flavorful punch with crazy but super delicious combos.    To start with, the four of us started with 3 \"Small\" (one was vegetables) plates.  I wish I could remember all of them, but they do change out items fairly often and the menu doesn't have all the same items as when we were there about a month ago.  One was a salmon dish with super super thinly sliced salmon.  The Crispy Chicken Meatballs were to die for with crispy coconut on the outside and the green curry sauce added a nice tang as well.  The Pecan Wood Smoked Beets were a surprise for me.  I'm just not a beets fan at all and had only ever had the canned slimy grossness at Thanksgiving.  But these were simply divine with the pistachios and ricotta.    Then, we ordered 3 of the large plates.  I wasn't as fully impressed with my dish, the Crispy Whole Fish for two.  I'm not one to enjoy my dinner looking at me and this one came with the head and eyes still right there...staring at me.  But the presentation was definitely on pointe.  At the time, it came with the most buttery tasting brown rice (except it was coconut oil I think).  My friends each got the Pork Shank, which was HUGE, and super juicy and then the Ocotillo Chicken.  It's fairly new to the neighborhood and well worth a visit!  Go with friends so you can share multiple dishes and flavors."}
{"text":"They've been open a year and you wouldn't know. Who's ever marketing this place, isn't doing well. First, it's hard to find. It's a brown building with a brown small sign that reads Ocotillo.  It's even confusing on where to enter. This place could be a gem! A huge place like that in the heart of the city... One of a kind, sadly they aren't utilizing it well. The bartender took his time getting to us, he didn't present any of their specials or products. We had to beg for any information. When I asked him about the food they were serving, he pointed out the wrong two. I will say, he was personably just not professional. I'd love to see this place boom, but from my experience as a past bartender, server and restaurant manager... Their management is letting them down."}
{"text":"This a great place to go enjoy the outdoor atmosphere with friends or even your furry best friend (they were very dog friendly). The patio is amazing, really spacious and well kept plus it's right in the heart of the city.   I went for lunch and be aware that the menu for lunch is a bit more pricey than similar types of restaurants in the area. As a lover of good food, this doesn't discourage me, however given the picnic tables and outdoor ambiance, one may not initially anticipate this (salads are about $15).   I had originally wanted to order one of their roasted chicken dishes, however I was discouraged. When asked about subbing (mind you also willing to pay) to switch out a starch for a vegetable (the chicken came with rice, potato, potato salad etc and no veggies) the waiter let us know that \"the kitchen is picky and strict,\" so they likely would not do this. I ordered a sandwich instead and my company avoided a more pricey entree for a sandwich as well ( we spent half as much as we thought we would as we were a little suspicious of the kitchen.   The red chile pulled pork sandwich was good. Flavor was smokey and well seasoned. It was topped with a fresh crisp slaw, pickled onion (very nice flavors to compliment the chiles) & grilled pineapple. My only complaint here is that the pineapple was not cored, which made it tough and not as nice as it could have been. I took it out.  We also tried the tandoori chicken sandwich and this was really good. It had a yogurt sauce and dahl spread that went really well together.   It's worth checking out again to see if it's consistent and to see if they become more flexible with ordering."}
{"text":"I loved this concept. The program of the spaces is separated around a central courtyard so it feels open and breezy. I was there for Sunday brunch and the food was excellent, really, on point. Everything that was brought to the table was excellent. I give four stars because our server was frazzled and slightly unorganized, and because they were missing a few menu items which was was disappointing.   I will definitely be going back to see if I can try the black truffle quiche."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday for this first time. My friend and I had lunch and ordered the Oaxaca chicken and Ocotillo chicken. The food came out crazy fast! Usually that's fine, but my friend's Oaxaca chicken was COLD. Not room temperature... COLD like it just came out of the refrigerator. Fortunately, our waiter Corbyn was super understanding. He took it back and a fresh HOT order came out. Both dishes we delicious! I also tried the mint lemongrass lemonade...very good! It wasn't ready but Corbyn had them make one for me. Great service up front. Back of the house just needs to get their act together."}
{"text":"I was taken here for a lunch meeting and I was impressed. We were seated quickly on the patio and we were able to enjoy a conversation without it being too noisy, which surprised me. It is right on 3rd Street, after all.  The area is really nice, with a coffee bar, a bar, a restaurant, and a lovely outdoor area where they seem to have games set up (I assume for happy hour).  The food was good and it had a really nice variety of sandwiches, salads and entrees for the lunch hour."}
{"text":"The food is always creative and fresh, a tantalizing mix of flavors from around the world, uniquely married into the perfect dishes!  The menu is amazing with something for every taste desire.  the libations and coffees are stellar as well. Sunday brunches are mind boggling with their cast iron skillet pancakes; bring your appetite! This unique plot of land and the decor is perfect for dinner for two, a family dinner, or even a special event like a wedding. We adore their outside seating complete with fire pit and a tiny lawn area."}
{"text":"Fabulous service!  We came here with a large group of about 70 people after our sons graduation and the staff here did a phenomenal job.  The food was delicious and arrived quickly ... they were on top of things from the moment we arrived.  Absolutely recommend this restaurant 100%!"}
{"text":"Seriously one of my favorite brunch spots in town. Such a cool atmosphere with plenty of outdoor covered seating as well as a large indoor area. Their brunch menu is amazing, lots of different things to choose from. I got the avocado toast with smoked salmon. And we share the cinnamon roll as an appetizer, which was simply delicious. They also have $18 Mimosa buckets!! Can't go wrong here!!"}
{"text":"Great fantastic location! beautiful building! great customer service. Food is Super Fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good but there were some things I didn't love.  1) It took a server at least 10 minutes to acknowledge us 2) Their small plates (at least the five that we ordered) were not small at all so we had a lot of waste and unnecessary expense.  3) When requesting recommendations, our waitress suggested that everything is \"great\" but the cauliflower (think gian head ot cauliflower with balsamic) and dried fruit with ricotta (cheese + fruit + balsamic like reduction) were just ok 4) Limited options for kids (burgers or pasta with butter)  The outdoor space is sprawling but pleasant at night.  There is community seating in the back and on the side of the restaurant there is a patio with more traditional seating. The patio is right on a road.  I ordered a mescal cocktail which was delicious.  You can go really right here, but maybe stop by Yelp before ordering."}
{"text":"I like the Food I just don't like the service... had to keep asking for our drinks..to be refilled"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant. I am not convinced by the flavors and combinations. Good Service and very respectful"}
{"text":"The brunch menu is awesome, and the staff is really passionate about the food that is served there. Service has been slow the past two times I have been."}
{"text":"I wish there were more than 5 Stars to give to this extraordinary dining experience.  Incredibly delicious, perfectly cooked and beautifully presented food with hearty, value-driven portions.                                                                      ***  Ocotillo is genuinely one of the finest dining experiences I've had in the Phoenix Metro area. It's on par with Quiessence and Binkley's without the big price tag. The slightly austere, industrial decor is the perfect, casual backdrop to allow the food to take center stage.  The complexity of the flavor profiles was beyond compare. Anyone that understands cooking would realize that the food at Ocotillo is prepared with the kind of precision that only comes without measuring; by truly knowing food intimately, like a longtime family friend.  Chef Sasha sent out some beautiful appetizers for my birthday and Alissa was very patient with our initial indecision about drinks and very attentive afterward throughout the meal.   I cannot say enough about Ocotillo. I wish I hadn't waited so long to visit. Highly, highly recommended. Even if you're not a serious foodie, you will love the experience."}
{"text":"With a high expectation for customer service, this place did not disappoint. I haven't been this impressed and satisfied in quite a while. Within 2-5 minutes of being seated, our server was prompt and pleasant. Even more, when we asked about menu suggestions I appreciated his knowledge base. Often when going to eateries, not many servers can vouch for their product...disturbing to say the least! But, not at Ocotillo!  The server recommended this amazing Korean BBQ Sandwich and my goodness, it was delish! We were eating within 15 minutes of order, likely sooner. Aside from good eats, it's all about the vibe. Another 10/10 for Ocotillo with good music, great space, and amazing people. I seriously don't know where they have room for improvement at this point. Maybe just teach other eateries how to be that amazing!"}
{"text":"No hype, but definitely a sweet spot to grab dinner. We don't exactly have spots like this in too many places across the US, where you can eat in a sort of patio-breezway in the middle of winter. That alone is worthy of praise. I sat underneath the heater and it was plenty warm, that's for sure. Didn't really need the heater. We sat on a long table with a big group and had dinner in the almost out of doors.  We started with a bunch of apps and I'mma stop you at the cauliflower because that's all you really need to know. All the industry magazines and trendwatchers say that 2017 is the year of the cauliflower, and I'd believe it. They roast it and season it to perfection and it didn't last long on the table. The salad with hummus was nice, the bruschetta was great, but it all began and ended with the cauliflower. Get it.  In another episode of \"What I should have ordered,\" the recently-returned to the USA fella in front of me got the ribs. Not only were they massive but they were indeed delicious. I snuck a sample. Deal with it. I ordered a pasta dish and while the flavors were there, it didn't all come together texture-wise. Not sad about it, just wish I hadn't eaten ribs the night before and had the drive to eat another rack.   I don't drink, but apparently the owner is a former/current sommelier, so wine is a big deal here. They seem to have a wide offering and if you pair that with the ambiance you've got a night of furtive glances and hopeful coupling going on before you."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to going to Ocotillo since I had read about it and heard great things. I figured it would be the perfect place to take my mom for Easter brunch. The restaurant wasn't very crowded when we arrived around 11:30, and the hostess seated us on the patio at a table partially in the sun. I asked if it was possible to be moved to a shady table but the hostess responded saying there were 200 reservations that day and all tables were reserved. Another table was seated nearby soon after and the hostess offered to move them to a table in the shade, right after telling me we couldn't be. The waitress took 10 minutes to even say hello, and she had a bit of an attitude as we ordered our food and wanted to be sure that a dairy allergy was recognized for one of our meals. Luckily the food was excellent, but everything else made for an unpleasant experience. As we were leaving, I took note that only 2 other patio tables had been occupied during our brunch, which means we could have been moved to a shady table as I had originally requested. Unfortunately we will not be visiting Ocotillo again due to our experience, and I will not recommend to friends and family, as I cannot insure that their experience will be better than mine."}
{"text":"Such a cool concept! The menu has something for absolutely everyone, I had the Vegan Coconut Curry Soup and it was outstanding! There is a coffee bar that opens at 6:30 am, the girls that we're working there are beyond personable and they have food you can grab & go that is so good & convenient!"}
{"text":"Had a bday dinner here. Everything was fantastic! Portions are hearty. Food is fresh. I had a pasta dish. Flavors were very nice. No complaints. I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu. Dessert was outstanding. Can't wait to try weekend brunch!"}
{"text":"Had such a good time at this spot. This is my second time coming here. HUGE, open patio, two outdoor bars, a large indoor horseshoe bar. This place is set up! Great beer selection. I had the crispy chicken sandwich the first time and am currently eating the roasted cauliflower. Both to die for. Eat here soon!"}
{"text":"Amazing Find!!!  The food is delicious!!!  Presentation excellent, taste excellent, atmosphere perfect & fun and the people are wonderful!!!  Nicole was as sweet as can be!  David is great and makes you feel right at home.  Eli recommended the most perfect dish the Salmon Tartine, I loved it!  It's my second time and it never disappoints!!  I'll be a regular for sure!  Can't wait to try their brunch I hear it's fantastic!!"}
{"text":"I was super excited about going to this new place just around the corner.  Tried it for a Sunday brunch date.  Atmosphere was great with cool outdoor section and inside including live DJ spinning laid back tunes.  We chose seating at bar instead of waiting.  Great customer service!  Very attentive and everyone seemed to really enjoy working here.  We ordered the unlimited mimosas which were a deal.  The reason for the 3 stars?  No matter how great the atmosphere and service is if the food is par...what is the point?  We ordered the egg white breakfast burrito but the spinach was ice cold inside.  Maybe try sauteing before?  Also, ordered the 2 eggs breakfast which was to include apple wood bacon.  The bacon was so thin and shriveled like something you would get at a fast food drive thru.  And the breakfast potatoes were so greasy and hard.  This is a beautiful place inside and out but they need to work on the food quality."}
{"text":"It's rare I like an entire menu of a new restaurant and this place killed everything our table tried. The pancakes are incredible, both the smaller ones and the huge skillet one. The burrata asparagus was so delicious. It was a combo that worked so well. I cannot wait to come back soon."}
{"text":"Ocotillo is a great venue for an event or large group gathering. It's spacious and has young, fun vibe. The service and cocktails were also fantastic, but the food was a miss for my group and I the night we went.   Our group ordered the Grilled Spanish Octopus, Peruvian Salmon Ceviche, Reginette Pasta, Wood Fired Beef Ribs, and Octoillo Chicken. The main issue we had as that almost every dish was burnt, especially the Octollio Chicken. Because of this the unanamous standout dish for the end was the Peruvian Salmon Ceviche. It was refreshing and most importantly not burnt. The ribs did fall off the bone but had a bitter burnt taste. For me the Reginette Pasta which had a lamb ragu sauce was too gamey for my liking and the bread was badly charred.  The chef and waitress were very accommodating and offered to remake the burnt dishes, so I definitely appreciate the excellent service. I took a risk and ordered an Octoillo Chicken to go and luckily it wasn't burnt and not overly sweet, which is why I would be willing to return to Ocotillo. If you are looking for outdoor space for an event or gathering, consider Ocotillo.  What I recommend: -- Peruvian Salmon Ceviche"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple times before, every visit has been exceptional. The ambiance and menu has never disappointed me. The last time I decided to eat at Ocotillo it was during Sunday brunch. My server, Corbin, was so attentive. He was friendly and clearly very knowledgeable about the menu. I'm not a giant foodie or anything so it made my experience a lot more enjoyable and comfortable as there was a lot on the menu that I didn't know what it was. The wine, beer, & cocktail list is awesome. They have pretty much everything. I ended up getting the brisket, and I've been craving it everyday since. I will definitely be back again! Thank you Corbin and Ocotillo for making me a very happy gal!"}
{"text":"Food was ok. Nothing that blew me away. The Bloody Mary was delicious and spicy. Love the buildings and the decor. Lots of unused space though. More seating needed. They were out of champagne. Never good - especially for brunch."}
{"text":"First time going Ocotillo, I went on a Saturday for Lunch. Started off with the ceviche and the server recommend toasted bread with it because it didn't come with chips. Love all the flavors and the touch of quinoa in it. Presentation was beautiful.   I ordered the special of the day which was a medium-rare steak with two eggs and hash brown cakes. The steak was a little bit on the fatty side but I loved the pesto topping. Two people could have shared this plate. My friend ordered the breakfast pork flautas and she said they were delicious.   What I love the most about this place is the presentation and atmosphere of the restaurant. It feels very elegant yet casual at the same time. The outdoor area is great for just grabbing a drink and lounging with friends in the afternoon."}
{"text":"Ate on the patio with a friend. Had the Dahl board and the smoked salmon board. BOTH delish! Well be back!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today and it was sooo good!  We were headed to the Phoenix Art Museum and this is just about a block or two away.  The service (the bartender) was on point and I had the salmon with lemon cream cheese capers, salad with pickled veggies and my daughter had the brisket sandwich with fries. I highly recommend both meals and I topped mine off with a glass of Chardonnay!  The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because the bathroom is oddly located outside the building in its own section - clean and neat but you have to leaving the dining building to get to it."}
{"text":"Hi, my name is Adam and I used to be in the service industry as well.  Now that we are familiar with each other, this place is AWFUL. What do you get when your restaurant has received good press and you have an awful staff who thinks you're putting them out by dining at their establishment? Answer: Ocotillo. Upon entering the restaurant through the (very cute and comfortable) foyer, we were greeted by quite possibly the rudest hostess on the face of the planet. Mind you, we had reservations for Sunday brunch, had shown up right on time, if not, early and only required a table for four. Once the hostess got around to having us seated (yes, she couldn't be bothered to grab menus and take us there herself), we were left unattended for 17 minutes. 17!!!!!! We weren't very far from the airport and realized going anywhere else would've just wasted an entire day, so, 17 minutes is better than 45. Once we ordered our drinks, we waited yet another 10 or so to get them delivered. These weren't four Ramos Fizzes, or anything, just two glasses of wine and two beers. Once we received our drinks, we ordered. The food took a while, but we did have a medium burger, so, I won't complain about that. Our food came and OH. MY. GOD. The chimichanga ALMOST made up for the horrific service. Listen, if you can tough through the torture that is the awful service and pretentiousness that are the employees, you should come here for brunch. The food is delightful, but the service absolutely destroyed my rating of this place."}
{"text":"I was so excited to really like this place. The vibe is great and the menu looks so promising, but falls super short. As a matter of fact, I was three people and everyone felt that it was really lackluster.    First, we ordered two appetizers for the table.  One, the salmon ceviche which after the first helping, no one ate more and the wings. The wings were really hot. They were so dry and with almost no meat at all. They give four wings. We each had one and no one touched the other one.   The entrées were okay.  I was going to order the ribs, but didn't want to spend $30 bucks only to be super disappointed.  So, I ordered the cheeseburger and it was good.   My two friends had luke warm responses and feeling about their own meals.   We skipped desserts, again because we didn't think the cost would be worth the experience.   Service was okay. Left over appetizer plates sat in the table for far too long. Maybe because they thought we were going to finish them.   I would not go back."}
{"text":"Beautiful interior but with summer being here, guests are uncomfortably packed in, making it so loud that conversation at your table or ordering is near impossible. I had grilled corn that was covered in a thick sauce but still on the cob. Too much work to cut individual slippery kernels off. Also ordered chicken meatballs with an elaborate description of promising flavors. Bland. Deserts looked good but I couldn't get out fast enough."}
{"text":"Had dinner at Ocotillo for the first time this past week - the food and service were fantastic.  The design and overall atmosphere was one of the best I've experienced at a restaurant recently - contemporary and clean, and quiet enough to easily carry on a conversation.  I'll definitely eat here again next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Ocotillo's co-op style space is beautiful. The property itself is worthy of four stars for its design and versatility.   Their inventiveness is apparent in the food as well. The house pulled mozzarella with carrots three ways was a delicious new take on the typical preparation. The pecan wood smoked beets were earthy and perfectly cooked. The truffle honey added a welcomed sweetness to the plate.  Most of the vegetarian salads and entrees were Mediterranean, so if that's not your typical palate, I'd recommend making a meal of the vegetable and small plates."}
{"text":"Loved the food, loved the service, loved the music.  Stacey at the bar was more than gracious suggesting wines not on the menu (?) and carefully boxing our take-home per my request.  Most disturbing to me was the kiosk inside the door across from the hostess desk where the general mgr/owner sat like a private school (read:  Catholic) teacher at HER desk with his chin in his hands overseeing his \"charges\", yawning, and apparently reviewing facebook or yelp reviews.  HEY GM! if you're not going to greet/interact with customers or help your wait staff move your office to the back and add more tables.  We'll definitely return and do our best to ignore the elephant in the room."}
{"text":"My wife and I went out for a date night and was pleasantly surprised by our random decision. The eggplant app was okay; however, the entrees were much better. I had the beef ribs. There was a lot of meat in the 5 ribs that came with the entree. I was not a big fan of the bbq sauce as I felt it was too bland, but the meat made up for it. My wife had the chicken dish which was superb. The chicken had a great flavor and so did the potato salad. Overall it was a good experience with a nice ambience to the restaurant. Would recommend if you have not been there."}
{"text":"lunch steak is great! so good I haven't tried anything else"}
{"text":"This restaurant is our new favorite place. The atmosphere is very relaxing and the food is unique and delicious. Our group tried the falafel burger, the cucumber with tomatoes and a salad- everything came out perfect and had great flavor. Our server, Eli, was so accommodating to a friend that has special dietary needs. He is a testament to wonderful service."}
{"text":"The staff at the maitre d' station lack common sense.  We arrived for Sunday brunch and were told there was a 20 minute wait.  I pointed out three tables which were set up but we're not occupied.  The staff repeated there is a 20 minute wait.  Seems to be extremely inefficient.  We left."}
{"text":"I totally love the atmosphere of Ocotillo, fun and airy in a nice area in PHX. I've only had one visit here and it may be my last. We came in as a party 8 on a Saturday early afternoon. The place was slightly busy, many parties larger than 6 were seated. The food was good, they only serve brunch on Saturday's, so we tried several pancakes, cinnamon roll, wings, breakfast chimichanga, bacon and also the bacon and egg breakfast BLT. All the food was so good! Definitely no complaints on the food! However it took almost 50 mins to receive our food. And there wasn't a ton of food rolling out into the outdoor seating area so I'm unsure what the hold up was. Our server was friendly enough, however he seemed very rushed and really failed in the beverage department, forgetting drinks the first time and then rarely refilling the soda's and teas. When you sit somewhere for nearly 2 hours and wait almost an hour for food, refills are a must! After the food was served he brought some extra syrup but didn't return to see if everything was okay or if we were in need of anything else. The other servers walking around and helping other tables didn't care about anyone not in their section, the bussers didn't pick up the service slack either. If the service was better Ocotillo would have received 5 stars! However, what a let down for our first experience here!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out and it's an interesting concept. I liked the inner courtyard setup with grassy area and a few outside seating areas. We opted to sit inside the main dining area which seemed a bit odd and was rather bright and a cold environment with little decoration, but I think they are trying to be modern.   After being seated it took a complete 10min for a server to acknowledge us which was ridiculous considering it wasn't that crowded. However once we did get a waiter he was fairly nice. We ordered a roasted sweet potato plate that had a Indian curry sauce which was an interesting twist, and a duck confit small plate for an appetizer. Both were excellent and a good portion and could easily have been a meal. Flavors were not overbearing but very good. One thing that annoys me though is that literally half-way through appetizers, about 5 mins in, our main meals came out. We weren't even halfway done. One thing I absolutely hate about restaurants is rushing a meal, especially a pricey one.  Next up we had the pork tenderloins with polenta,  and a pasta with a curry ragu. The tenderloins were cooked well and tasty but the whole dish was absolutely swimming in butter and oil (check out the photo). In my opinion if a restaurant needs to add that much butter they don't know how to cook properly, or the chef or line cook etc messed up and was in a rush and didn't bother redoing the dish. Either way not good and takes this place down a notch. The pasta was good and very different. The Indian curry ragu was unique and spicy and loved it, however the pasta was way to thick and chewy considering the ragu is already very rich. A thinner pasta would have worked better, but overall very good. Desert was a strawberry compote with biscuits and was excellent and not too sweet.  Overall decent place but they want you in and out quickly and the service is a bit spotty considering the price tag."}
{"text":"A party of nine of us came by for the first time on Saturday the 23rd for brunch. Ocotillo did not disappoint. Both the food (some of what we ordered included the ceviche, gem lettuce salad, and the brunch brisket) and our server, Bryce, were phenomenal. We couldn't have been better satisfied. Our party included my uncle, a professional chef himself, who said it was one of the best restaurant experiences he's had in Phoenix. We'll all be back again for sure."}
{"text":"Second time going to the restaurant.  My first experience was excellent.  Today I ordered iced tea and a burger.   Iced tea came with no ice.  Burger came with rotten tomato slices on the side and generally unappetizing presentation.  Asked the waitress for mustard and salt [there are no salt and pepper shakers on the table you have to ask].  I waited and waited and waited. The burger was cold. I left the table to search for the manager.   Told him I have been waiting for condiments and my burger is cold and the iced tea has no ice.  He never apologized or asked how he could \"fix it\", he just angrily asked \"who's your server\".  He later came out and picked up the plate and gave me a glass of tea with ice.  Too many choices for restaurants that are consistent in their food and service.  Not going back!"}
{"text":"We went in with high hopes.  Menu looked awesome... Wine menu was impressive... Unfortunately, the food left a lot to be desired! Our waitress was MIA most of the evening. Especially after she screwed up our drink order.  We ordered the Create Di Gallo and we received all pork fat! Literally, mouthfuls of pork fat!  We also ordered the ribs. Taste was on point but again, a lot of fat... We expect fat with ribs but these ribs were very fatty.   Wine menu was fun but I'd pass on the food. Next time will order a drink at the bar outside vs. ordering food in the restaurant. I'll have dinner at China Chili (next door) next time!  Plus, it was very  noisy!"}
{"text":"Oooh My! You must partake in the Cauliflower appetizer. I've dubbed it the \"the flavor Bomb\". Excellent choice with crazy good simple flavor.  We enjoyed some great cocktails from the mixologist (recommend #16.... tequila'sh alternative with Serrano for a little heat!  Nicely done!  We enjoyed a burger that was a mash-up of brisket and burger fix'n. Really tasty.    Excellent vibe to hang with friends or just significant other.  DJ throwing some good tunes in the background. Definitely will be back for more food and fun!"}
{"text":"I've been to Ocotillo a handful of times now so I figured I'd finally write this review. Today we came for brunch and our expectations were far exceeded. We started off with some mimosas and the Cinnamon bun which was incredible. We also added on the Sundried Strawberries in Balsamigo. When I took my first bite, I questioned if I liked it but as I continued it just got better as all the flavors mixed. My boyfriend got the Fried Chicken and said it was made to perfection. We've tried a couple other things on the menu for both breakfast and dinner. The ingredients always taste fresh and the service has always been top notch. We've definitely found a neighborhood favorite."}
{"text":"One of the very best restaurants my wife and I have been in Arizona. We started with an incredible roasted cauliflower with a kale pesto (that's right kale pesto). My wife had the carrot fatoush salad. I had the breakfast brisket. Totally awesome. Everything. The only thing that's a bit lacking is the service. But, then its not fast food. It is definitely fine dining without the pretense."}
{"text":"Came here last night for my birthday dinner. We've been coming since it opened, however tonight we had exceptional service from Josh B. He took care of our complete group and it was a great experience! Food was awesome, I can't seem to stray away from the Ocotillo Chicken, I get it every time because it's so good!"}
{"text":"I love Ocotillo,  the menu has so much to offer!  I have been here on numerous occasions,  from the complex vegetable dishes to the handmade pastas and BBQ ribs. I can not pick a favorite! Desert is amazing too, try the sesame ice cream w/ yuzu marmalade or Almond Joy ( coconut & chocolate sorbets w/ toasted coconut and almonds a top! )!!!"}
{"text":"Had higher hopes for Ocotillo's dinner menu based on others' recommendations. The ambiance on the patio was nice, but we shared a long park-bench table with a different (and loud) group. Certainly wouldn't recommend for a romantic occasion. The salmon tartine was excellent, but my and my wife's entrees were underwhelming. Service was quick to refill drinks, but the frequency of our waiter's check-ins was sparse. It took quite awhile to get our check. Considering the glut of excellent restaurants within a few minutes' drive (at the same price-point), you're likely better off betting on someplace else."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! I have been there twice. Once for a private dinner party and once for the Sunday brunch. The restaurant it more like a complex that has multiple areas for enjoyment. It has an outdoor park like setting, bar area, interior seating area, patio area and a coffee house. You can have a meal, lounge around while having cocktails or some coffee.   The food is delicious!!! The portions are just right. I tried several appetizers that were all great. Hands down it was the best steak and eggs I have ever had. The menu prices are reasonable for what you get."}
{"text":"We went with a group of 7 women. Service was very, VERY slow. It just felt scattered and disorganized. We had to as for silverware, plates for appetizers, water refills. My order was sent to the wrong table so while everyone in my group was eating, I was staring at everyone awkwardly. It was outside so naturally there are bugs but when did the bud get in the food, in the kitchen or outside where we were sitting? This is one of my girlfriend's favorite spots but I wouldn't visit again. The brisket with polenta i got was good. I tasted my friends avocado toast and it tasted like they sprinkled a little bit too much lime and salt in the spread."}
{"text":"I highly recommend checking this restaurant out. Cool well decorated atmosphere,  my sever whose name I can't recall, was outstanding. The menu is very impressive and creative.  Very well written and well thought out offerings.   The food was creative and fresh and tasted great."}
{"text":"I've been to Ocotillo a few times and have enjoyed their salads and small plates but the other day I decided to order their Ocotillo chicken to go. BAM! That's what my taste buds said the moment I put this deliciousness in my mouth. Actually, even before that taste my eyes were like - oh yeah!  You get two pieces of chicken with skin on the bone and underneath is this revelation of a potato salad. The overall flavors are sweet and spicy due to the honey and chili's. The juice from the chicken kicks up the potato salad flavor even more. Game changer. I have to admit that I find the atmosphere a tiny bit pretentious so I haven't loved my dining in experiences despite the lovely decor, but I won't hesitate to order out this chicken regularly. That way I can also dive in with my hands like this chicken demands :-). The bartender who took care of the to-go's was super nice and welcoming, thank you!"}
{"text":"I have been here for both lunch and dinner now. It is busy and it is loud depending upon where you sit but I love that the setting is like five restaurants in one. There is a range of outdoor seating and indoor. The long tables outdoors are perfect for an event and the patio is great for a more intimate meal. I've had the roasted cauliflower with kale pesto three or four times and it is literally something that I crave. I am also completely taken with the carrot fatoush salad. It is a super complex, interesting salad with deep flavor. I find the portions generous and unless I have my teenage boys with me, there are leftovers. The only thing that I've tried that wasn't as big of a hit was the falafel burger. The idea is terrific but the outcome is too dry for me.  Overall, great location and great place to meet friends. I see there is also a coffee bar here which I have yet to try. Once more, Phoenix shines with another great restaurant."}
{"text":"Came for a Saturday brunch and ate inside. Make a reservation if you want to avoid sitting outside in the summer heat.  Ambiance wasn't too bad. If you want to have a more intimate brunch, this probably isn't the place because the DJ plays the music pretty loud.  I had the brisket with polenta and Sazarac. It was delicious. Other guests had the burger (too much bun), but the pancake was delicious from what I heard."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal - was in town for a work conference from NY and decided to give it a try.  I was in Phoenix a few months before and all of my food was terrible so I was weary,  this place knocks it out of the park.  The flavors are original and work so well together and the portions are HUGE - you normally don't find that when the food is this high quality.  It has never been harder for me to choose after seeing everything the large group seated next to me had ordered."}
{"text":"Easily one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix. Great atmosphere whether you are inside or out. The staff is always on point! Nothing better than consistently great service. The food is constantly changing and evolving and keeps me coming back for more. Every time I go to Ocotillo, it is a new culinary experience and I am always impressed with each dish. Great flavors in everything. The cocktails alone are worth the visit as well! Unique drinks that you won't find anywhere else. Looking forward to going back! Thanks again Josh, Avia, and Tori for a great evening!"}
{"text":"Super disappointed by this place. We made reservations for 7 people for a business birthday lunch on a Monday afternoon and definitely wish we would have gone somewhere else. The restaurant itself is absolutely beautiful, inside and out. It seems like it might be best to just go for drinks when the weather permits outdoor leisure.   Our server wore a dirty, backwards MLB baseball cap and looked/acted more like a cook or busser than a server. (If you've ever worked in the food industry, you know what I mean.) We ordered appetizers, and those were decent and timely. Our food took a while, but it was the busy lunch hour so not too odd. What really bummed us out was how terrible the entrees were.   My salad came without any dressing and with tomatoes (which I was super specific about because I'm allergic.)  They took my salad and brought it back out still without dressing, and I could tell the'd just picked the tomatoes out as there were left behind juices and tomato seeds. Furthermore, it came without ingredients it said were in it on the menu which made for a super bland, dressingless salad... Then I found a legitimate leaf from a garden weed; furry, spiky and all. Yuck! I wish I could say my dish were the exception, but...   One coworker had an overcooked salmon with a side a mushy, bland, lukewarm greens and another a salad overrun with onions. One ordered the smoked brisket sandwich and was pulling out huge chunks of fat. From the half of the sandwich she choked down, over half of the brisket was fat sitting on her plate. Our birthday-guy ordered the brussel sprout chicken salad, and that thing even looked gross! The chicken looked and tasted like it was boiled and several days old, and the brussel sprouts were so bitter and hard. They must have been at least a week old. It was absolutely covered in cheese too, I assume to disguise the rubbery, pale-gray colored strips of chicken on top.  Only one of us enjoyed our meal, and that was our carnivorous, garbage disposal coworker. For sure, will not be going back and will tell others to steer-clear. Definitely wish I would have taken pictures, but we already felt awkward sitting without eating and leaving plate fulls of food without asking for to-go boxes.   Our server could obviously tell we didn't like the food, and made a point to ask which we were honest about but didn't make a fuss. Didn't ask for a discount or manager or anything, just super bummed it was such poor quality, bland and just over-all bad food.   Not super important, but we didn't even get offered a dessert menu even though we made a point of telling our server it was a coworker's birthday.   Maybe we just came on a bad day, seeing that the reviews are generally positive, but that comes out to a very expensive bad day..."}
{"text":"Had some friends from out of town come and I wanted to give them a taste and feel of uptown Phoenix. This place definitely  met that. Great urban feel, very modern and open. We were there for brunch and enjoyed the bottomless mimosas. Pretty pricey but the server made them worth it. Very attentive to our table!!! Paid more than usual for a brunch but this restaurant was well worth my money.   They had indoor seating surrounded with Amazon art, and outdoors they had clean lounge areas or tables and chairs to sit at."}
{"text":"I had a coffee meeting at their coffee bar and then wandered over for lunch by myself after. I sat at the bar and was the only customer waiting for food. I'm not sure what happened, but either my food was given or taken by an employee. They then had to make my meal again. This ended up with it taking a long time for me to get my meal. I waited to see what they would do to remedy the situation. My waitress gave me a discount on my meal for the delay. That's why they are getting 5 stars instead of 3. This place is large and trendy and has good food and great service. The fact they recognized their mistake and made it up to me without me having to say anything is evidence of great customer service."}
{"text":"I've been 2 times now and each time it's been great! The food has been fantastic and the staff has always been pleasant. Definitely recommend to everyone who wants a great atmosphere and awesome food! Plenty of outdoor seating too which is nice for our weather!"}
{"text":"This place is a MUST!!! Perfect ambience, location, classy food and wine.  This place knows how to pair ingredients, food and wine!  So good, be prepared to order the same thing again in one sitting!  Once you experience, you are hooked!  Brunch today was amazing and peaceful!  I can't say more other than GO!  I'll be visiting this week with my colleagues for lunch and I've found the perfect spot for any meal!  One word, \"AMAZING!\" Check it out!"}
{"text":"Short Story-   Very Good Food in a Comfortable Attractive Atmosphere served by untrained servers. Based on one visit. At least my server was very inexperienced serving tables and knew nothing about the food.  More detailed longer story-  I arrived five minutes before the restaurant opened and the parking lot only had two parking spots open. As I strolled to the restaurant I noticed a small coffee building and lots of attractive outdoor seating with an outside bar. I also noticed the restaurant wasn't full of guest yet so I wondered why the lot was full.  The restaurant is sleek, modern, light and airy with comfortable seating. The menu is modern with international accents. They feature hot and cold not - so - small, small plates and larger plates that feature many chicken dishes. The plates are meant to be shared so a couple might want to share up to three plates. The wine menu is written for wine dummies and has symbols so a ten year old can understand each bottle of wine.  The restaurant wasn't full yet but the hostess sat us at a table that they were using as a bus stand filled with many used wine glasses. She pulled the table apart so goody-goody we could sit on the clean end. The pulled table left very little room between tables.  We informed out server that we were sharing the plates we ordered but she didn't space them them out and served all three plates at once barely fitting them on the small deuce of a table. We told her to bring one plate back so we'd have a little room.  We started with the Spinach Salad. The detailed fresh salad sat on top of silky buttery smoked salmon. It was a very perfect balanced salad and was very good.   Next was the Japanese Fish and Chips. I asked what kind of fish was used. A trained server would know what kind of fish was used. A GOOD server would say something like, \"I don't know but I'll find out.\" Our server said, \" I think..Japanese Fish. I was eventually told after asking three more times that the fish used was cod (or at least that was what I was told). It was mild sweet moist and meaty and prepared to perfection. The fish was so good I would not have recognized it as cod. The fries might have been the weakest of what I tried as they were tasty but sort of dry and not crispy. They also didn't come with a dipping sauce so they were easy to push aside.  The Thai Style Roasted Chicken was developed with flavor and was very juicy and moist. Perhaps from sitting the skin was soggy and not edible to me but the sauce over it was absolutely delicious. Based on this one visit it's a good bet that any chicken dish will be delicious but might have soggy skin.  When we finished the plate instead of our server saying something like we have many delicious desserts or something like can I get you anything else?........The server said, Do you want anything else?  I do note this is a newly opened restaurant that serves up delicious food. Service based on my visit isn't on the same level as the food.  Some growing pains but a wonderful menu with very good food in an attractive atmosphere.  Slight Update- 11-28-15 Service has improved and the food is still delicious! This is a wonderful Restaurant!  4.5 Stars"}
{"text":"One of the most amazing restaurants in our valley....Seriously!!!! Superb ambiance!!! The space is one of the most uniques spaces in the valley. Eco friendly, filled with love and warmth. An extremely welcoming atmosphere. They may have had some growing pains when they were the new kid on the block with the hosts but that is all behind us. From the moment you enter this fabulous space to the moment you leave, one feels the warmth. The food has always been phenomenal. We have been there for brunch, coffee at the cafe, beer at the beer gardens, happy hour at the bar, lunch on a weekday, dinner on a weekend. Every meal has been an explosion of carefully balanced flavors. My husband makes pasta at home from scratch and he says their fresh pasta is better than his. That is huge coming from him. The fresh herbs and spices are so creatively and beautifully married together with the main ingredient... The wine list is AMAZING... And oh so so reasonable! Dave is an excellent sommelier/owner.... We take all of our foodie friends to this fabulous space and our out of town guests.... Seriously, whether you are a local or a visitor, this is a NOT TO MISS adventure that your palate will thank you for. Its creative but yet approachable... No I do not have any affiliation to this magnificent place, just a local that LOVES this place and wants to see it succeed because of the love that has gone into creating this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Brunch was very good. We sat in the beer garden which was nice, but probably more suited for group drinks or dinner. Overall it was very good and I will be going back."}
{"text":"Sad we moved out of AZ before this place opened. As of today it's in my top five all time for flat out goooood food. We had a lot of dishes. My favorites were the ham and Frye bread appetizer. What a brilliant imagining of ham and cheese. I'm going to daydream about it! We had steaks, squid, clams, cauliflower. It was all absolutely top of the line."}
{"text":"A fantastic concept in uptown phoenix. Great food. Great atmosphere. Excellent cocktails and tap list. I've been here a few different times - brunch, drinks, lunch, dinner - the experience was spot on each time. Definitely worth checking out. I believe it won New Times' 2016 Best Restaurant."}
{"text":"Been here for lunch 7-8 times.  Salads and veggies are always great.  Chicken items mostly good - their Ocotillo chicken is solid and I also like their new Peruvian chicken.  4.5 star food but the sevice is regularly frustrating thus bringing overall rating down to 4 stars.  On last visit we had a hipster dufus who was (like most of their servers) obviously never properly trained and obviously is not making a serious effort.  Server tip #1:  when someone orders an item requiring a steak knife please bring the knife at some point BEFORE the food is served.  Server tip #2:  it is poor form to bring plates to the table and not know who ordered what.  Server tip #3:  never disappear for 10-12 minutes and fail to refill drinks, especially on the patio when temps are 90+.  Server tip #4:  you should help - out and clear plates/refill waters/etc when passing tables which are not 'yours'.  But despite the regular service failures the food is good enough to make up for it.  I've tried all their salads and veggie side dishes.  We always order 1 or 2 extra veggie sides to share with the table.  I think I like the roasted cauliflower best - but the cool cucumber dish is nice on hot days.  And a warning if you order the Japanese - style fish 'n chips - the fries are REALLY fishy tasting (which I like but others have not cared for).  A pretty great though somewhat pricey (about $20/pp incl tax/tip sans alcohol) lunch spot.  Note I think the interior space gets too noisy at lunchtime - and thus much prefer the patio..."}
{"text":"I want to love this place.  The space is beautiful, the staff is friendly (though sometimes frustratingly slow or forgetful), the menu looks delicious, their cocktails are tasty, and it's in my neighborhood. If you have visitors in town, it's a great place to show off how hip Phoenix is!  I have eaten a meal here at least 6 times.  But I have disliked so many of the things I've ordered that it makes it hard to enthusiastically recommend.  I feel like I'm playing some weird version of Russian roulette every time I order... \"Is this going to be the third of the menu that's awful, or the third that's fine, or the third that's excellent?  Who knows?\"  For example, the \"crispy\" falafel burger is just very dry and boring, the Japanese-style fish & chips was fun for the first two bites and then the seaweed/salt flavors were overwhelming and painful, a duck pasta and pork pate-thing were [insert sobbing emoji here], but the new eggplant dish is excellent, their cauliflower is awesome, and everyone I know loves the breakfast chimichanga (which the server told us the chef hates making... #awkward).  I like this place for small snacks and drinks, and I like their coffee bar.  I will visit for dinner rarely."}
{"text":"Hostesses amazing! Greeted with a smile right when we walked in the door. We elected to sit at the bar. Bartenders were absolutely attentive. Cold brew coffee was awesome. Ordered the egg white burrito, came out with a foreign object in it, so I quietly sent it back. I wouldn't have even added this in my review had a manger done a table touch or even the chef, but the bartender who was appalled took care of the whole situation. Brunch was slow, and in that situation I expect a manger or chef, someone who should have the utmost pride in their establishment and for their guests to at least make an appearance to let me know my experience is valued. Like I said, bartenders, hostess amazing! Management needs to work on guest retention, that situation was solely retrieved by the young female bartender which is the reason I'll be back for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Vibes vibes vibes! The environment was ever so endearing! If there's one thing I would suggest getting is the pancake...WOW! It is huge and filling and took 3 of us to finish it! I ordered the salmon and wasn't a fan which is why I helped my friends out with their pancake and let me say I'm glad I did!"}
{"text":"Been twice for lunch now. A bit pricey for lunch. First time I had the chili second time I had the chicken mole salad.  I was able to make more than 1 meal from each but still seems a little expensive for lunch. Take out experience was definitely better than sit down. Walked over, order, waited for order to be ready and it seemed faster than getting lunch at the panera on Central ave. Eating in wasn't as good of an experienced. It was loud and seating 8 at a picnic table didn't make it easy for group discussion. I'm sure we will be back again so hopefully ratings will only go up from here."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Ocotillo! I have never dined in- I have always order to go.- Every-time I order to go the bar tenders are super friendly and fast! I think I have tried pretty much everything on the menu and I can't complain about a single entree.  - I'm a little disappointed that they no longer offer the fish and chips, but the grilled salmon sandwich makes up for it! :)"}
{"text":"I want to like this place,  I really do..  But with service so downright abysmal I don't think I can.  Here's the deal,  our server was an awesome guy when he showed up but he showed up so few times I didn't know what to think of it.  He could've been busy,  he had a table inside and out so maybe that's why but you know what that's not my problem.  That's all on management.. Maybe they need better management or more staff..  I mean I was there on a Friday night you had to know if would be busy..    Let's move on..  The food... My pasta was blah..  I couldn't care for it,  lacked flavor and the sauce left a lot to be desired. My friend liked her fish dish and couldn't stop raving about it. Maybe its just me..    The dessert was uninspired too. Two of of the the desserts were just lame. Also we had asked for coffee with desserts but that came about fifteen minutes later.  Or server remarked he had spent two months figuring out how to use the equipment.  He's probably better off spending another 2 trying to get better at it because the coffee was the most watered-down substandard swill I've had to date.   So here was my experience to sum it up: poor service poor food, poor drinks.  The next time around it won't be so bad, but it will take me awhile to get over this one."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  We eat low carb so it's tough to find nice restaurants with good options. This place was super tasty and accommodating. The cauliflower and wings were awesome. Staff and managers are friendly as well. Try to get an outside seat"}
{"text":"Great vegetarian options and the cutest, hippest bartenders (Ryan especially!). Will definitely be coming here more!"}
{"text":"We have been to Ocotillo a handful of times before this visit and have always been very very pleased. This time we were so put off. The service was just plain bad. Our server took very long breaks in between asking if we needed anything. It wasn't until the food runner brought us an empty pepper shaker (after asking for salt and pepper), that I walked to the hostess stand to express my concern. No water refills, bizarre faces when asking for extra butter. (Side note: Bloody Mary with no garnish... not cool!) The food is good, the outdoor space is great, but will people keep coming if the $100.00 brunch is just plain painful. We won't. And the girl setting the tables touched a dirty rag then the rim of the water glasses then her hair then more water glasses. Ew."}
{"text":"I love the menu variety, locally sourced food, and amazing drink list.  Terrific physical layout, cool people.  And even though I'm not a hipster, I feel welcomed and included.  Yay!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Highly recommend the brisket brunch and the skillet pancake. They were so good!"}
{"text":"SO GOOD!!! The plates are shareable. The ribs are no joke. The service was great and Joshua made awesome recommendations. Cant wait to come back"}
{"text":"This place is new and so far the menu has a lot of delicious options. It was hard to choose because the flavor combos were all so intriguing. Lots of wine selections and classy cocktails"}
{"text":"I liked mostly everything. My server was nice and knew the menu well enough. All food was completely flavored and tested in the same way as described in the menu. One problem is that there are a lot of people here, and the line is too long."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious!!! One thing, we didnt get a hello at the door nor was the hostess welcoming when we first arrived. It took 5min before someone put our name on the list when there was no one in the lobby. They need to improve customer service, but other than that, everything was awesome!"}
{"text":"This place has a great set up - from entrance, bar, ambiance, service and food. I'm going to rate our server above the food however, she was awesome, on top of everything and even made an adjustment to a request that we had without us having to ask - I think she knew we hesitated and asked us instead. The drink selection was great and so was the wine I had. Dinner and apps were all wonderful, the only downside was our fish was a bit overcooked and laid on the grill longer than it should have. Which can suck when that's your entree, but hey, everything else I would definitely go back for."}
{"text":"When it first opened I worried, but ocotillo is a welcome addition to the n'hood.  The breakfast was really good and healthy portions."}
{"text":"Not sure what happened this visit. Been here twice before and usually sit at the bar.  I'm not sure what they were trying to accomplish but there was not enough server presence on the floor. We came right around 1015a. It seemed as if our server had way too many tables spread out. They were out of multiple dishes and drinks that I was trying to order. Which is fine. Just adjust the menu or just do a better job ordering. It slows the server down to go back and forth and puts the guest in an awkward situation to have to order on the spot. Food was decent as it has been before. Tried to modify the burrito but was told they were premade. Huh? At a place that has an increased check average and a large kitchen making items from scratch what's the benefit to precooking eggs and rolling them in a burrito. We eat out often with our two year old and we play the get in and get out game.  We order a bunch of food and our drinks fast so in return get us our check and bus our table. We literally had to get up, go to the host stand and ask for our bill so we could scram.   Dial in uniforms. Dirty, sloppy appearances is a tragedy. Stained wrinkled shirts and hair everywhere on support staff is off putting.  Oh just to hook you up with my last bit of annoying advice...the pictures in the main dining room look great but are hung crooked. So a three piece ensemble looks bad not lined up."}
{"text":"Very creative menu! Although I wasn't sure what I was going to get with half of the stuff on it. But what we got was certainly tasty!  Pictured is the spaghetti squash from the vegetable part of the menu. The squash was a little spicy but very flavorful. And we also had the parsnip, pomegranate, goat cheese avocado appetizer as well. Which was so incredible I didn't want to share!  Can't wait to go back and try brunch!"}
{"text":"Service is pretty terrible and the hostesses seems to be working in slowmo. It seems that when 50% of the tables are full at 5:30pm and there's a long list of reservations starting at 7:30pm, no one new is allowed to be seated...so, I guess the hostesses don't trust the wait staff either.  Atmosphere is nice and the blue corn pancake is adequate, but I would recommend Windsor, Cibo, or the Yard for a friendlier experience."}
{"text":"Dinner review: 2 star service 4 star food 3 stars overall  Came in from it off town.  Cool ambiance and vibe, sat outside, which was nice as it was really jamming (loud) inside. Menu definitely has a twist. The roasted cauliflower starter was Legit. Shrimp pasta came with overcooked butterfly shrimp, but besides that the dish was great. My date got the pasta dish with mozzarella and sausage, was just ok.  They must be new. Still figuring out who does what on staff. Awkward roles of the waitress and people literally serving you the food. The waitress asked us if it was our first time there, and how we heard about it... we said yes and yelp, buy then didn't get any recommendations or dinner specials listed from her. Didn't know when to bring out sharing plates, serve ware or refill waters. Again service a 2. Food a 4.   Not from phx, so won't be coming back. Hopefully it gets better for the locals."}
{"text":"We came for lunch and were not disappointed in the slightest. Initially I was caught by the exterior architecture, which is unique and eye catching. The interior ambiance was more high class along with highly attentive service. I had the Iberian Ham sandwich which I felt was all around perfect. The fresh bread they used was a perfect balance of light and chewiness, which will not make you feel full. Their balance of ham along with a delicious spread to compliment the cheese and veggies worked perfectly together. Beyond sandwiches their ahi tuna bowl and lunch pasta offerings too were well received by those who I was with. This is a wonderful lunch venue that will not disappoint if you are looking to spend the money."}
{"text":"Huge, gorgeous location with knock-your-socks-off  food, poor acoustics (it's super loud!) and service that's pleasant but might be a tad slow.  The fare is foodie-grade blissful. The ingredients are amazingly fresh and the preparation and presentation are phenomenal. Really: excellent food!! There were 6 people in our party, and every single dish looked gorgeous and produced satisfied sighs.  The place is more complex than restaurant: huge, modern, and gorgeous. The only downside is you can't hear yourself think inside the main restaurant.  There are tons of outdoor seating options and a huge grassy area for tiny tots to play.   This place has been open only a few weeks and it's already packed! Make reservations but be prepared to wait a few minutes even then. The staff are working super hard to work out the kinks, so they're super friendly but your order might take a while. I'll be sure to visit in a few weeks to update this - until then, just keep in mind that the convenience factor is low."}
{"text":"I luv this place! Beautiful layout, i wish we had sat outside because the inside was soooo loud (the reason why  i didnt give them 5 stars). had the ocotillo chicken, bahn mi and falafel burger, we shared. Oh and can't forget those fries! All was excellent. I can't wait to go back.but i will sit outside!"}
{"text":"We had a great date night dinner here!  Fabulous food, outstanding service (thank you Corbin ).  Good wine selection.  My bf had a cocktail and really enjoyed it.  This placd would also be great for groups in the winter...  Lots of outdoor space.   Excited to find such a great spot close to home: we'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"The BEST customer service, what a great experience.  We were running a little late for our reservation so we called ahead to let them know since it was a busy Sunday and we didn't want to hold anyone up.  Despite being late, we were sat immediately and the hostess even thanked us for calling to let them know that we were running behind. Our server was fantastic, she had a great personality and a good sense of humor, I was nursing a hangover and she helped get me fixed right up.   I highly recommend the strawberry scone and the breakfast chimichanga.   Attentive, courteous and tasty!"}
{"text":"Went here for a friend's birthday with a group of 12-14. The food was really good and it is a pretty cool atmosphere. However, the service left a little to be desired. I understand that it's tough with big parties, and can be a pain for servers to make sure everyone is getting what they need. Initially, ordering was fine but when came time that my wife ordered a second glass of wine and I ordered another beer, the wine took almost half an hour and we had to remind him of it, and he had completely forgot about my beer. He did end up comping the beer though. Overall I would probably give it another chance with a smaller party."}
{"text":"The zucchini was good except it needed more burrata and more peppers.      The burger was not memorable. Better burgers at Welcome Diner!!!  Cauliflower needed more flavor and to be served with lemon wedge or something.   Linguini was heavy (too thick) and the sauce was one note.   The restrooms are located in the beer garden area outside of the actual restaurant....it is 47 degrees tonight. It would be lovely if someone would put coat/purse hooks in the stalls and near the lavatories!!!!!!!!!  Also, the wall between the women's restroom and the men's restroom is not solid.  It was very noisy on the men's side!  GROSS!!!!!! GROSS!!!!!!!  GROSS!!!!!!!!! DISGUSTING!!!!!  Servers were friendly!!!!  GM was very nice too!  I wish I could say more positive things about this place because it is very chic!  Still, I will not come back for the food."}

{"text":"My wife and I have been to Ocotillo a few times and each time there's been something slightly negative that chips away at our experience. In all fairness, we have enjoyed the food but the service and the atmosphere has continued to free fall off of a cliff. Whether it's the restaurant's lackluster service, or being seated at a table where the afternoon sun will burn your retinas when there's an available shaded table in the same section or the awful acoustics while trying to have a relaxing dinner - there's always something off. This evening was no exception. Tonight, we were treated (for the last time, most likely) to a swarm of flies during our entire dinner; some crawling on the wall behind us, a few hovering over our food, a few brave ones daring enough to land on our table and one pesky guy hanging out on the cushion next to us while we ate waiting for a crumb to drop. It was so bad that one of the servers was stalking the restaurant with a fly zapping gadget that resembled a small tennis racket that made an annoying buzzing sound every time he smashed it against the window to kill a fly (which, most of the time, he was unsuccessful in). It was bad enough to have the flies zooming around our head, in and out of our entrees but to also have to see (and hear them) being killed while we ate was utterly disgusting.   Astonishingly, when we brought this to the attention of our waitress, she casually dismissed the reality of the situation without offering any kind of solution. It would have been one thing to address the problem and for the restaurant to offer some small token of apology or embarrassment over the situation or even a free dessert to go so we could enjoy it in our non-fly-infested home... anything!   But alas, the problem (as all problems at Octotillo in the past have been) was ignored. We actually left the bag of food they boxed up for us under the table (maybe it would attract the flies and everyone else would finally be able to enjoy their dinner!?) but the waitress followed us out of the restaurant to make sure we took it home with us (so we could put it in the garbage there).

{"text":"Well.... This is my first visit and I must say it was very good! Love the atmosphere, service, and food was very tasty... I Had the tandoori sandwich and the flavors  where amazing ! The quinoa side was tasty Too!"}
{"text":"Nothing to see here people, just a bat shit crazy lady who regularly orders 4-5 Carrot Fattoush salads \"in case I'm not back down here for awhile. Hands down, best salad in town. If I am ever in the neighborhood I stock up and eat nothing but Carrot Fattoush for a week. I am even eating it right now. I tried to figure out a way to get them to deliver it to my house but the whole living in North Scottsdale thing is apparently a nonstarter. I've thrown a party for 200 people at Ocotillo, hosted a number of large business lunches and meetings and had them cater about a half dozen events for me since they've opened and they consistently knock it out of the park. I have yet to try something on the menu I don't love, AND Dave Johnson's new glasses are really cool. I'll be back soon as long as I don't creep everyone out with my weird salad hoarding. I think it's time for a Scottsdale location..."}
{"text":"Very hip place with great food in the heart of downtown Phoenix! I'll be coming back with friends and family! The smoked salmon sandwich and ginger mint lemonade is delicious!"}
{"text":"So it was my Birthday and my sweetie took me out to my favorite restaurant. We had delicious wine and cocktails and delicious food. Then we ordered desert and both were delicious. Our waiter said Happy Birthday about 7 or 8 times and on our reservation we specified that it was for a Birthday occasion. When our check came there was no discount on either of the 2 desserts while the table next to us had a Happy Birthday with a candle to blow out and lots of attention. Max was great but completely ignored the special occasion. So folks be warned about ocotillo and special occasions, you may want to go somewhere where it's always celebrated."}
{"text":"First time here with the brunch gang and everyone was equally impressed with the experience. A remarkably varied menu leaves one with the difficult decision of what to order. Fortunately our server was well versed in the offerings, patiently explained several of the options including his favorites and made the suggestion to order several items to share, which is what we ended up doing. No regrets there--it allowed for a satisfying combination of savory and sweet.  Loved the modern decor and cozy ambiance here. Suffice it to say the food was delicious (see pictures) and the service was exceptional.  We will definitely add Ocotillo to our brunch venue rotation!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here.  I will definitely come back.  The duck and octopus were superb. Nice drinks and great service."}
{"text":"Let me tell ya about my favorite restaurant in all of Phoenix! Ocotillo is amazing! The warm and friendly staff love the place too and it shows. The baby spinach and smoked salmon salad...I would eat everyday of my life! And talk about options...from which patio you are feeling, to which inventive delicious cocktail fits your mood...they have it all :) bonus...they are puppy lovers too."}
{"text":"Second visit here. On Sundays it seems that they only serve their brunch menu. My husband had the pork belly, I had the breakfast taqueria and my mom had the salmon appetizer. Mine and my husbands food was good, but the salmon board ticked all of the boxes for flavor, portion size and presentation! If you haven't been here or driven by, this really is an interesting place. The outdoor seating is plentiful and shaded. The indoor seating is more limited. The entire restaurant is made from huge metal shipping crates, it's a really cute place. Last, but not least, we brought our dog and sat on the patio. They brought her a bowl of water right away. Thank you for caring about customer service! Can't wait to visit again."}
{"text":"Great Saturday and Sunday brunch vibes. Perfect for outside dinning on a nice day! My friends and I sat at the community table outside, which did not bother us as there was only 3 of us. However, if you want to sit outside with a big group, you may have to wait for a spot in a Sunday or Saturday morning.   The Saturday we went, they happened to have a live DJ there. Not sure if that's a common thing but it definitely added to the ambiance. The food was a bit pricey but you do get what you pay for unlike some other places in central phx that charge too much for the quality they serve. I had the breakfast Chimichanga and it was A-MAZ-ING! My friends and I all shared a bottle of Champs for mimosas as well.   The waitress told us they plan on opening a late night bar that'll be open til 2AM and I def plan on checking that out once it's done!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here at this restaurant,  it was recommended by a friend . I was offered to sit at a table & bench that was not wiped down thoroughly. I had to request the hostess to please wipe down the area before sitting down because they're were crumbs left behind. I waited for about 7 to 9 minutes before anyone came to my table. When the gentleman arrived he was only serving water and when I went to ask him a question he said \"I'm sorry I'm not your server I'm just serving water only\" before I can even ask my question. I just wanted to see if they had a Wi-Fi password but he had already walked away. I then had to stop another waitress who happened to be walking out to the patio in order for me to ask if there was a Wi-Fi password she said \"that she would check into it and come back shortly\" as she did not know. By this time it had been about 13 minutes before my waitress finally came to my table and introduced herself. I asked what her recommendations were and I was showing her pictures from Yelp and she had explained to me that their menu changes often so those pictures may not be the same as what's on the menu today. I was a bit disappointed at as I had already set my mind to a certain plate on the menu. I ordered a breakfast sandwich and instead of the fries I requested a hashcake.  The waitress seemed reluctant that the kitchen would be able to substitute the fries for the hash cake but surprisingly they were able to. The meal was delicious especially the hash cake, so I'm glad that they were able to accommodate me. And overall the atmosphere and food was great. We sat in the dining area inside. Although l loved the out door seating areas. I just didn't care for the service considering it was 1 p.m. and it was not busy at all, at least not in the area that we were sitting in. They're were about 4 tables besides ourselves being occupied. I did notice that they were dog friendly so that is why I gave them 3 stars. Next time I decide to come I'll definitely bring the pooch. I just hope that the service will be much better. I live out in the east valley which took about 35 minutes to get to Ocotillo.  I'm sure I passed over 50+ restaurants but I came here because it was recommended. But a customer should not have to wait that long to meet their waiter/waitress. It's  important to remember the value of customers because that's what keeps your doors open."}
{"text":"We ran it back here & did it right this time! When I say we did it right this time, it's because we knew better & got THREE steaks! Lol  If you're coming here for brunch, GET THE STEAK ($21). I said this in my previous review, and I will reiterate it because I still feel the same way about it. The dish itself comes with a huge steak, a hash brown cake & two eggs. It's very filling, but ridiculously/unbelievably delicious & will leave you very satisfied.  The type of love my cousins & I have for their brunch steak is something else. The steak had us groaning each bite. It had us doing happy eating dances. It had us grinning from cheek to cheek. It had us describing it in words we don't typically use. Yes. Their brunch steak is divine.  So some of you may wonder what else they have on their menu that could possibly be great to pair with such a beautiful brunch steak. Well, brace yourself......... BOTTOMLESS MIMOSAS ($18/person).  Fair warning about bottomless mimosas though: You think you're fine & dandy until you stand up & realize.... woah okay..... maybe I had one too many! LOL. But hey!!!! It's cool. Sunday Funday right?!  TIP: Their entire establishment is gorgeous--interior AND exterior. Typically, it's hard to get indoor seating on weekends unless you have reservations. So if you don't want to sit outside, plan ahead & make a reservation. However, if you plan on walking in, the outdoor patio seating is shaded & has fans running through out the day.  FINAL THOUGHTS: this place is a must try/must see! I will always return here when I come to Phoenix..... I promised myself the next time I visit, I'll save room to try the Nutella Iced Coffee boba (as a dessert or a walk away beverage)...... But yes, you read that right. Nutella. Coffee..... BOBA. Praise the Lord."}
{"text":"Awesome food and A great atmosphere! My husband and I stopped here on are way from the airport to Sedona !  A great brunch and drinks - as well as coffee bar."}
{"text":"Swung by because it was close to the Va after lunch. Beautiful grounds and nice friendly service. The smoked salmon app was delicious can't wait to come back and sample more"}
{"text":"From the moment I stepped foot in this establishment, I found what true love is.   The design looks like a Pinterest board threw up all over it - in the best possible way. It nails the \"desert chic\" look, and adding the downtown vibe, you totally feel like a socialite when eating here.  I've only eaten here for brunch, but every time reservations have been made and carried out smoothly. The service has been impeccably warm & welcoming, and the $18 bottles of champagne with your choice of juices don't hurt either.   The hash-brown cakes have stolen my heart, and their bacon is mouthwatering to say the least. It is wonderful for big and small groups alike, and even better it's dog friendly!   This restaurant has a been in my top 2 places for brunch for a while, and I don't see that changing any time soon."}
{"text":"Been here twice now atmosphere is wonderful, service is phenomenal cocktails are always made just right and the food is absolutely delicious  I also have to say the presentation of food will blow your hair back just the way it's put together it's art  Great place for the bf and I we plan to take the parents soon so they can experience it as well"}
{"text":"II started with a 4 star rating, but as I listed the attributes of Ocotillo, it has to be five, even for a first visit. The soundtrack was the clincher. This place has it all:  Thoughtful and well-executed menu Focus is on integration of vegetables. I went with the roasted cauliflower as a starter. It's quite different and really good. My salmon main was very nice too with equal parts salad and salmon along with just enough starch. The smoked beet and chevre salad is exceptional.  Attentive service Its the little things that count. Instead of leaving me with my fork and knife from my appetizer, both were removed and replaced with new for my main. I like it best when I'm well informed and visited, but not overly so. Ocotillo does this.  Incredible layout There are multiple sections to Ocotillo. My dining partner said it reminded of a W Hotel. There is an outdoor area with fireplace, lawn and casual seating. I'd describe the inside as upscale industrial. One inside area is more secluded, the other is high--top seating with an open view of the kitchen - yes.  Vibe Efficient. Effective and Relaxed. Combining these attributes is no small feet. It takes thoughtful planning and solid execution. Well done Ocotillo.  Soundtrack Now for the kicker. In 2008 I was cloistered at the Park Hyatt in Tokyo for 36 hours. Jet lagged and depressed, I listened to a continuous loop of electronica / eclectic from a hotel channel. When I say continuous loop, I mean for 36 hours. After I left I could not get this soundtrack out of my head - so killer. The only song I knew was Heroine by Blonde Redhead https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVMF6gYbGEE. I even contacted the hotel afterward, but they only spoke Japanese so that was useless. This was years ago. The soundtrack at Ocotillo came as close as anything I've heard since. I id'd a bunch of the songs. Very happy about this."}
{"text":"The restaurant was very nice and neat and plenty of space inside.  My biggest issue was the brunch burger. Do not order the burger from the brunch menu as it is VERY bland and they have nothing to offer to make it taste better.  It is like eating a mushy-bland sponge.  And, when the server came over to ask how it was I told him it was bland and undercooked he proceeded to tell me how awesome his was when he ate it for lunch.  Needless to say he got a .34 tip.  Don't tell customers how awesome your version of the same meal was AFTER you just had a horrible tasting meal."}
{"text":"We have wanted to eat here for a few weeks and finally made it in. The inside was reserved for a private party so we tried sitting outside. There were air conditioners and it was pleasant, not cool but totally comfortable. The patios are huge with tables, couches and grassy areas. Really a beautiful, contemporary space.  The GM and the waitstaff were so friendly and great offering suggestions and chatting. We ordered the crispy chicken meatballs and the clams for apps. The meatballs were ok- the sauce and chilies they sat on were great! Maybe more of the sauce? If you didn't get a bit of sauce, chili and cilantro with the meatball it was a bit bland. The clams were good but had bacon and beans. I'm more of a lemony garlic sauce clam person.  We ordered the beef ribs with cilantro lime fries and the roaster cauliflower to share. Jeez! Good thing we did. There were 5 ginormous ribs and they were SOOOOOOOOO delish. I am not a huge beef rib fan and I could have finished them off but would have seriously paid for it. The fries wet crispy and tangy with the cilantro lime. I  cauliflower but this was just ok. Again, the sauce it was sitting on was really good. it was almost a head of cauliflower, sliced in two. I think we would have preferred smaller pieces with the sauce mixed in.  For the four items and three drinks (they have a delightful rose on he menu) it was $100.  A bit on the pricy side but the portions were HUGE! We brought one whole meal home of ribs, fries and cauliflower.  Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"This place's food is as great as their ambiance. I came at lunch and had the Green Chili Pork Torta (Guacamole, Black Beans, Cilantro Lime Cabbage, Cotija Cheese, Hot Sauce) and it was knock your socks off good. All the ingredients were very flavorful and complimented each other incredibly well.   Now mind you I only had one dish, but the 3 ladies at the table over were raving about how fantastic each of their dishes tasted. All the food looked great and were very well presented.   Next time I'm in Phoenix I will definitely come back to this cool looking joint and enjoy the terrific food."}
{"text":"***Updated*** The manager has apologized to me, and that means a lot to me. It takes a lot to admit when you are wrong and I also understand how it is easy to become defensive when it comes to something you are passionate about. I wish them the best of luck moving forward.  ***Old Review*** Wow. I had to change my review because now the manager, Walter S. had the audacity to \"compliment me\" a message on Yelp cursing me out, saying I was ignorant and tried to insult me saying I must eat at \"Subway\" or \"Denny's\". People are entitled to their opinions. That's what Yelp is all about. I didn't even give that bad of a review. I made sure to point out all the positives and a said I would give it 3.5 stars. I have gotten bigger, better salads at many other restaurants, Olive & Ivy, Maizie's, FEZ... Just to name a few.  Walter, this is your wake up call. You can't afford to act like this. All the people who work at the restaurant and who have invested time and money into that place rely on it's success, and it cannot afford to fall because of a prideful man who cannot take criticism."}
{"text":"Deserves 3.5 stars. I liked the cauliflower small plate the best. The grilled octopus was good however was served with cold beans. Also tried the Ocotillo chicken and a vegetable pasta dish.   Very loud inside. Nice ambience outside where we ate."}
{"text":"Stopped here for breakfast/brunch on a few weeks ago and it was really great. The food was awesome, service was great, and its a really cool space overall. I had the breakfast with pita & pita pals which was both great and huge -definitely could have been split I think. My boyfriend had the breakfast chimichanga and he also enjoyed it. Mimosa was good, a little heavy on the OJ for my taste, but par for the course I guess. All in all I was really happy with it and will happily go back if I am in Phoenix again."}
{"text":"FOOD: Visiting Phoenix for a conference and this place was recommended by a friend! My friend and I were both very pleased with the food we got/shared. Great flavor and good portions (not too little/too much). We got the cauliflower for our appetizer which was presented as two whole pieces of cauliflower. At first I thought it was gonna be a pain having to cut it up ourselves, however it was so tender and great flavor! Loved it! We also got the small plate smoked salmon and the bucatini pasta! The smoked salmon was served cold, with cream cheese, capers, pumpernickel toast and pickled veggies. My friend was not that big a fan of it, but not because it did not taste good, she's just not used to the way they prepared it. I think having cold smoked salmon is a preference and isn't always for everyone. I loved it though, the salmon was so tender and not too smokey, just the right amount. Everything else that came with that dish was just average though. I did not really like the pumpernickel toast, and would have preferred a different type of bread/toast. The bucatini pasta was so good. The pasta noodles were al dente, which I LOVED! Very simple and delicious pasta...AND it wasn't too heavy like most pastas.  There was a little kick of spice to it, however it was not too much.   SERVICE: No complaints here. Our sever was very friendly and helpful. She went over the specials, and even helped us make the final decision on what we ordered (we were slightly indecisive)!   ATMOSPHERE: Super chic and modern! Loved the atmosphere. They have both indoor and outdoor seating, which is nice.   PARKING: we took a Uber here but I think there is a lot? Not too sure."}
{"text":"The ambiance is awesome. The décor... the architecture... the diversity and overall use of space... and perhaps my lack of enthusiasm is largely influenced by the service (or lack thereof) but my brunch experience was a disappointment.   I had the grapefruit brulee and the beet salad.   The beet salad is served on a bed of herbed ricotta and while generally good, was nothing noteworthy. I would've liked a piece of bread or crostini to accompany the plate.  The grapefruit was effectively bruleed -- which is not an easy task, if you'd ever tried it at home.  However, no one took the time to section the grapefruit and it was not served with a grapefruit spoon. I realize this may sound petty but the ambiance and the menu descriptions lend themselves to a more upscale experience.   When I requested a spoon (since none -- serrated or not -- was brought with my food), I was given a large soup spoon which was not a practical option for a grapefruit (-- bruleed or not).   On a second request, I was brought a sundae spoon which was better sized but lacked the serration.  Honestly, I feel ridiculous typing this because I realize it sounds so menial but in addition to being a peeve, the utensil exemplified the ineffective service."}
{"text":"One of the best new restaurants in Phoenix, I haven't had anything here that I haven't loved. Notables are the homemade pastas and Peking duck. Can't go wrong :)"}
{"text":"Beautiful spot for a wedding and reception. Hands down the best \"wedding\" food we have ever had. Service was impeccable"}
{"text":"First time at the restaurant for dinner. Unbelievable menu choices, food was great and the settings cool. Will come back with friends to enjoy the outside area."}
{"text":"Where to start, food was good and we tried several dishes. Not the greatest, but definitely different in a good way. The best part of this restaurant is the ambiance. Great location! Great clean facility, rustic with a modern twist! Great patio and outdoor seating! Above all, great service!   A great place to come hangout with friends, get some food and just hangout having some drinks and wine. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Had an amazing time at this new spot.  Went for brunch and with my girl and she loved it as well. Great service and energy. I will definitely go back when I'm back in town."}
{"text":"Ocotillo is my favorite restaurant in central Phoenix. Everything I've eaten there is wonderful, and beautifully plated. The menu changes a few times a year which is very exciting. It starts with the food, gets a great follow up with cheerful and prompt service. Unique wine and beers. They get really busy sometimes so make reservations!!! or maybe choose a week night. Eli was our server last night, he really guided us through the menu. You can tell the staff enjoys working there.  Trust me this place is a diamond...I'm predicting more great things to come!!!We love you OCOTILLO"}
{"text":"Excellent quality and food selection. Great atmosphere! Beautiful for brunch!  The servers are really honest about what's good on the menu, so feel free to ask them if you are stuck between a few options! Very busy during weekend brunch, just take note most people dress nicely for that as well."}
{"text":"Gave this place another try and again was disappointed. The food is just hype ingredients and nothing more. Asked for a side of avocado and when I put it over my eggs it was smothered in lime juice. I informed my waiter and she said it comes like that, asked if I can get another order and was told kitchen is backed up and could take 10 min. Told her never mind since I was already ready to get out of there. Before she brought the check she apologize for her \"crappy service and that she never works brunch\" (her words) before we got the check."}
{"text":"I went for dinner with my friends on Friday night and the food was excellent. The architecture of the building is unique. The ambiance was very pleasant. The signature vodka drinks had a different flavor than the traditional drinks. Overall, we were very pleased with all the courses from appetizers to dessert. I'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"1st visit with girlfriends. We shared pasta walnut dish, brussel sprouts with bacon fried egg, and shareable charcuterie board. Pasta & Brussels were number one, I could have eaten all the pasta myself!   2nd visit Easter Brunch with family.   Reservation process easy. Requested inside seating since we have the baby, which they accommodated. Great hosts.  We ordered; Strawberries & ricotta - excellent,  I actually order this as a dessert, so good!  Fried cauliflower - good, comes with pesto sauce that's really good! Pita hummus plate - my mom loved it, pita looks legit inhouse made.  Salad (Greek?) - very fresh greens huge salad  Fried chicken & polenta fried egg on top- arrived with a small tiny portion of chicken(scroll down, and why I feel cheated), flattened chicken thigh?!   3rd visit today! Mother's day brunch! I only got 1 good pic! You try eating with a 9month old!   We ordered;  Strawberries & ricotta- still fans Chicken wings - good, temp was warm not hot. Weird. But we still stuffed our faces!  Fried chicken & polenta- ummm grandma's plate came out & looked amazing nice huge portion (we talked about how we got cheated on Easter! Lol! Next time I order this I better get the grandma treatment or sending back!  Smoke beat salad with pistachios- good, for my taste I just added salt & pepper.    Crab pasta dish- sounded & looked good, my husband enjoyed it.   We will definitely be back,  trying to make it there during the week for the dinner fare!"}
{"text":"Ocotillo has made its way to my top 5 list of favorite restaurants in the Phoenix area! The location is awesome I love how it is laid out and the little coffee shop! The DJ was cool too! It was a really fun environment. You could tell it was good because there were so many people there despite almost all of the surrounding roads being closed down due to a parade. Being a vegetarian, usually my choices are somewhat limited which makes it easy to choose what to order. Here I couldn't decide so I ordered like way too much stuff haha but I shared it! Our waitress was in training and I wouldn't have known if she didn't say so because she did great! So all of the things I tried were: iced green tea (I think the guy said tropical green tea?), Nutella iced coffee without boba, stuffed medjool dates, strawberry scone, falafel burger with quinoa, and the carrot fetoosh salad. Everything was absolutely delicious. The tea was very refreshing. I only tried a few sips of the Nutella coffee, and it was yummy! Tasted like a really good mocha. The medjool dates were stuffed with goat cheese and marcona almonds, and we all liked them, they were sweeter than I expected, but I'd love to try to recreate this recipe at home. I usually do not like scones much but I liked this scone a lot, especially the cinnamon ricotta on the side. My main meal the falafel burger was yummy! A little bit dry because of the falafel patty but otherwise fantastic. I really liked the pickled beets on it. I tried one french fry and liked it, but I'm glad I chose the quinoa as my side, it was fresh tasting and light. The carrot fetoosh salad was great as well! I was skeptical of carrot hummus but man I couldn't stop eating it. It was a filling salad too. It was all a tad pricey but entirely worth it! Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"This is one of my fav restaurants in AZ so far. Been here for dinner twice, but this was my first time here for brunch. Fried chicken with polenta was recommended by the waiter, and he was right that the chicken was super tender and the polenta was smooth and silky with the right amount of seasoning. Kale pesto with basil and mint added the highlight to the gigantic roasted cauliflower. The matcha pancake was a lot larger than expected. The matcha flavor was not really standing out, but all pancakes taste good with the right amount of syrup on top. Yum! The decor is contemporary, and the patio is well covered by the mist. Highly recommended for both dinner and brunch!"}
{"text":"Food is creative and fresh.  Portions are HUGE!  The space is gorgeous.  The drinks are a delight."}
{"text":"Great large outdoor space with shade, fans and misters. Food was good, but it's pretty pricy. Went for brunch, but I'm not sure if I'd go back for dinner because that would run about $80 for two people."}
{"text":"We started off with a glass of wine and a nice pulled pork appetizer. The ambience was quite relaxing and entertaining. Each employee was attentively seeking our happiness.   We followed up the appetizer with some pasta and some ribs. Hands-down some of the best ribs I've ever had. The pasta had a jalapeños and fresh Lamb Ragu sauce fresh cheese fresh bread was amazing.   We will definitely be coming back again. It started to fill up around 8 o'clock. So make a reservation.  Cheers"}
{"text":"First time stopping in and enjoyed every bit of it. Has a weird but funky and cool set up to the place. Real open courtyard type area for places to sit inside and outside. Was greeted with a smile and was helped right away. All staff seemed to be very friendly and willing to help and give opinions on food. I had the Oaxaca Chicken plate with brown rice and black beans. It was very tasty and served at a fast pace. Perfect for a lunch spot while during a work day. Also got a chance to try my fiancés Japanese fish and chips which was also very tasty. I would definitely come back for more and have the same dish although very eager to try other menu items. While there don't forget to order the tea if you are a passion fruit type person."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Gotye - Somebody That I Used To Know)  But I know I didn't have to sing a song Rock out like I always Yelping and like it was nothing And I really need your love But you fed me like a mother and that feels like love  No I didn't have a drink to start Have some coffee before I sit and then think of my review I guess that I don't need that though At a place they all call Ocotillo  At a place they all call Ocotillo At a place they all call Ocotillo   I was somewhat confused when I first visited Ocotillo.  It's layout somewhat reminds me of a compound of some sort; there was mess hall, coffee shop and a outdoor patio!  It's definitely different from your average restaurant visit, which you can take however you wish.  I came here for a Saturday brunch and sat at the bar so I can get a view of the place.  I had to order my coffee at the shop first before I sat.  My friend and I always order to share so we went with the Iron Skillet Pancakes, Breakfast Chimichangas, Black Kale Salad, and side of Hash Browns.  The pancakes came with a berry compote on top and served with butter and syrup. I didn't think it was anything too special.  Our chimichangas was breakfast style with eggs, chicken, broccoli, cheese, on top of a green chili sauce.  I would say it would have been everything that I would made my omelette with, but in a burrito style.  My favorite was probably the side of hash brown.  Crispy on the outside with a hint of cheesy creamy taste.  Not sure what they put in it, but was definitely worth ordering.  Finally, the salad was my other favorite of the day.  Served with pomegranate, almonds, parmesan cheese, and persimmons, which was totally uncommon place to find in a salad I thought, but it worked!    Overall, Ocotillo was totally refreshing and hip spot for your dining experience.  The layout is totally weird for me and the service here was friendly and kept a good conversation.  The food is playful and fun thus making this spot a must for all foodies! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Very loud and not staffed for a busy Sunday.  It took over an hour for food and then it did not all come out at the same time or even within 20 mins.   Won't go back even though the food was good."}
{"text":"Ocotillo is the perfect brunch spot in Phoenix. I have been here several times and am always amazed at their food! The restaurant itself is huge so even when it's busy it doesn't seem crowded or loud. We have always sat at the bar and had a great experience with super friendly bartenders. The menu is a little weird- they don't have names for any of their dishes, instead it's a list of all the ingredients so you know exactly what is included. I love the sun dried strawberries in balsamico with herbed ricotta, basil, and country bread. It is the perfect semi-light start to the day. I've also had the smoked salmon with capers and dill creme which I thought was good. It is served with a tea egg, pickled shallots, and grilled seeded bread so you can build your own toast creation. I couldn't write a review without mentioning their fantastic Bloody Mary {Sobieski vodka | house spicy tomato juice} garnished with an olive, lemon, lime, pickled jalapeno and white cheddar. I don't know what they put in their tomato juice (I assume crack) but it is amazingly spicy, fresh, and delicious- seriously one of the best bloodies I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Went there the other evening for an early dinner with a companion.   I had the TAGLIATELLE and he had the VEGETARIAN CASSOULET.   I don't know.   The food presented well but lacked in flavor.    I was curious as to why there are salt and pepper shakers on the table.   I can see why.  My dish was rather bland in taste, and I was thinking, if I added a tiny bit of salt, I'm sure that would have helped.   Perhaps they are being mindful of not too much sodium, which I agree completely with, but there are other ways of flavoring food with herbs and spices without adding to the sodium content.  After all, I'm not a big sodium person myself.  I don't know what they meant by \"white shrimp.\"    Looked like any other shrimp to me.   Yes, they were large and tasty.   I did take about half of it home, and I added my own seasoning to it, which, after having done so, it did taste a lot better.    It is pasta in an herb sauce with some sort of oil.   I guess he liked his cassoulet.    He mentioned he would probably order it in the winter versus the summer.    I didn't know what he meant by that.   Perhaps he associates the beans and other veggies in the dish with something one eats on a cold, blustery day.   I tried a bite, but got some of the goat cheese, and you know what I think about goat cheese.   UGHHH!    It's not a dish I would order since I am not a lentil person.   It is a cute place.   Once the place started filling up, though, it was hard to hold a conversation with one's \"indoor\" voice.   The acoustics are bad.   Would I go back?   Probably not."}
{"text":"We were so looking forward to spending time at Ocotillo because we've heard so many great things.   We won't return after leaving without placing our order.  We arrived with our novels, ready to order coffee drinks and nest while construction was occurring on our home.   The service on a Saturday morning around 10:30 at the coffee bar was deplorable.  We were literally abandoned by our server.  We had to continually request milk, a top for cup etc.  We were not impressed.   Upon realizing that it was too chilly to sit outside we went inside to the restaurant.  Although we were not yet ready for lunch we thought we could find some brunch items which would allow us to be inside.   The first two items I selected could not be adapted for my food allergies because the items were 'pre-prepared'. After listing my food allergies the female Server started arguing with me. I suggested she not argue about my food allergies since she Knew nothing about this and was clearly Not listening based on her alternate suggestions.   she then stormed off.  We got up and left and won't be back. I recommend you go someplace else if you need any accommodations."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a while now and recently checked them out for brunch/lunch on a Saturday.  It's a cool property with several distinct dining areas.  The service was fast and friendly.  I thought the medjoul date and ricotta appetizer was excellent.  My breakfast chimichanga was very colorful but could have used a little more spiciness.  Dining in the main inside room was very noisy as the sounds were bouncing off all of the hard surfaces and made it a little hard to carry on a conversation at times."}
{"text":"Great place to eat most definitely recommend. Just try it once I promise you will be back!!"}
{"text":"Our waiter was awesome!!  Thanks Eli :-) :-)  The wait time was appropriate..we were enjoying the ambiance as we waited."}
{"text":"Food was great, I hate the fact that i ate while on a full stomach. Man, anyways great experience and shoutout to Corben. Great guy that was patient and informative with helpful suggestion."}
{"text":"I had the smoked brisket but the service is to be determined. Maybe another stop in? When and if whoever is reading this comes in, you must get the smoked brisket."}
{"text":"Second visit to Ocotillo with party of four.  Two chicken dinners, one spicy duck, one beef ribs.  Atmosphere is great, service is good, food...meh.  Pita bread appetizer was pretty bad.  Pita was kind of dried out and folded into a big mess.  Hummus was tasteless.  Olives and feta were good but how hard is it to serve olives and feta?  Duck was incredibly hard to eat as were the beef ribs my buddy ordered.  We were both throwing elbows sitting next to one another trying to cut our dinners into bite sized pieces.  Flavors were ok but presentation and difficulty in eating the dish made it less than great.  My side dish was green papaya salad -- I don't think I have ever had a GPS but this one was either a poor example or they must just suck overall.  Our party was in agreement that the food was \"just OK\"."}
{"text":"I'd give it a second chance. The space is nice. Much larger than I anticipated when we approached. It's open & has great light. There's a buzz about the place though it comes off as a bit trendy. The service was good, not great. They seemed to be a bit understaffed. Our server took quite a bit of time between greeting, drinks, and our lunch order. I had the Asian style pork belly. It's listed as a savory dish yet it had a lot of sweet elements that really overpowered the savory. The pork belly was not prepared properly. The meat was very tough and exceedingly difficult to cut with a knife. Very tough and chewy. The exact opposite of what a nice, slow cooked pork belly should be.  It might be a nice place to meets friends for drinks and snacks, but watch your wallet. It seems Phoenix is attempting to compete with other major metropolitan cities by raising rents and food prices, yet with little to no added value."}
{"text":"Great dinner on a Saturday night.   We didn't have to wait and the server was incredible.   Food was spot on and there were enough vegetarian options to keep me happy.   Much recommended."}
{"text":"Seems like there are two distinct types of experiences you can have here, good, or very bad.  Ours falls in the very bad category.  After a somewhat cold reception, we were seated and then waited, and waited for our server.  They were out of our choice of beer/wine, so we got water.  I got the Ocotillo Chicken, while my partner got the Asian Dumplings.  My chicken came out luke warm on the outside, ice cold on the parts that were touching the mostly frozen potato salad.  Our waitress never came back after the expediter dropped the plates off, so there wasn't a reasonable way to send this back.  By time she did, it was too late, I was too grossed out.  The Asian Dumplings were flavorful, and hot."}
{"text":"So good! I have rarely been able to give a 5-star rating, but this place earned it! Really cool layout with a courtyard area. The food was amazing! Our table ordered the fried zucchini, with & without peppers, pork sandwich, chicken dumplings, curry soup, roasted cauliflower & chili. Everything was fantastic-not one complaint. Then we ended the meal with the Girl Scout cookie pudding truffle. Can't wait to go back and try more. The only warning I can give is it's extremely loud inside at the tables. We couldn't hear each at our table. You might want to try the patio or bar area."}
{"text":"I had high expectations of Ocotillo based on the experiences I'd heard about from trusted friends, family, previous Yelp reviews, and having worked with both Chef Walter and Dave Johnson at previous endeavors over the years.  I was hesitant to plan a special group dinner there without firsthand experience, but after meeting with Steve, their onsite event planner, and getting a tour of the space (indoor, outdoor, coffee bar, etc...), I was more excited than ever.  I'm proud to say that my high expectations were not only met, but exceeded.  Five sexy stars for a fabulous and very memorable group dinner we had at Ocotillo last Thursday night!  We curated an incredible menu based on our budget and the dietary preferences of those in my group, and I believe that everyone was more than satisfied.  Huge shout-out to MacAllister for handling our group of 21 with ease.  The Cauliflower appetizer was a clear highlight - if you're at Ocotillo, you cannot miss it;  I'm still thinking about it!  I also loved the Carrot Fattoush appetizer.  Entrees are large portions, but my group did well with them... we're good eaters!  I had the Ocotillo Chicken and was pleased.  I also tasted the Wood Fired Beef Ribs and I can say that both the ribs and the fries served alongside them are definitely worth the splurge!  I don't think you can make a wrong decision here as I saw others enjoying the pastas, fish, and even the Falafel Burger!  As hard as it was, we saved room for dessert and I was so glad that we did... I recommend the apple tart, but again, I'm sure you cannot go wrong.  Ocotillo offers a huge list of wine, beer and cocktails as well.  They've got you covered with whatever ambiance you're seeking from casual bar seating or more fine dining inside, plenty of outdoor options (which is where we ended up and it worked perfectly), and even a coffee bar, which I will definitely be back to visit ASAP.  I hear they have a special kids menu and do an incredible brunch as well.  Already looking forward to returning very soon!  Thank you Team Ocotillo!"}
{"text":"This was my first time and I was excited to try this new spot, especially after reading other reviews and seeing pictures. The venue and the food presentation were both really impressive but the food itself was disappointing. I ordered the beef hash and there was so much gristle that I decided to just eat the potatoes and fried egg, and not even try to finish the beef. To drink I ordered the Nutella ice coffee boba and to my disappointment, the boba was totally hard and I was handed a soup spoon to eat it as they didn't actually have boba straws suitable for boba.  Cute place, but I'd only return if I wasn't paying."}
{"text":"Came for lunch and was less than impressed.  The service was good and the restaurant itself has a great vibe and a feel trendy feel to it. I love the open concept and all the outdoor seating they have available.  I wasn't super impressed with the food. The meal started out great when we started with the watermelon mango salad. Probably one of the best salads I've ever had. Very fresh and light with a whole bunch of flavor. There's some sort of spice that they put on it that adds a great unexpected kick.  I ordered the ocotillo chicken, my mom ordered the pork flautas, and a friend ordered the pork shoulder sand which. All of the meals came and the presentation was great. However the food looks a lot better than it tastes. I actually had to ask for something else because my chicken was sickly sweet, and I'm a sweets person. I was not a fan of the taste whatsoever. They replaced it happily with the pasta dish with the pork meatballs. That dish was much better, the meatballs were very flavorful and paired well with the pasta. I tried both of my companions meals and wasn't too impressed with their meals either.  Looked the look and feel of the place but the food left a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"Oh man. I heard skeptical reviews of this place because of loud music or something, but whatever. It's all love. This place is great.  I know I always talk about the vegetarian options, and this place does have plenty, but we have to HAVE TO talk about the brisket.   It's huge. It's tender. It comes swimming in yummy salt meat flavored juices. There is an egg on top. And in the middle of it all is PARMESAN GRITS! Parmesan. Grits. I couldn't finish it. I got to eat it twice. I'm so happy : ' )  The wine list is also really fun to look at, even if it's a bit overwhelming. There are little icons that denote different flavors. The only rough thing is that the most tannic wines seem to only be sold by the bottle (wails).  My friend got the massive pancake, and it was massive. Like, so massive. So were the salads, which I eyeballed from across the room because I'm a creep. Basically, I get the sense these folks don't mess things up. The place is nice to sit in, the food is great and reasonably priced. It's just all around good stuff happening here."}
{"text":"What a delicious pastrami sandwich! Enjoyed a nice lunch with Emilia, very cool atmosphere and the food amazing!"}
{"text":"Was very excited to give this place a try. We arrived about 20 minutes before our reservation time so that we could sit at the bar and get that experience too. They have a great selection of wines by the glass as well as bottle (although I found the wine key to be very distracting -- obsessed with matching up the images to the key so I could figure out what notes were in the wine, most people probably wouldn't bother). They have a great handcrafted cocktail menu and a cool, clean vibe in the bar area. The hubs is quite a personable guy, (at parties I hide praying people don't talk to me and he has a crown of admirers around him -- polar opposites) so he asked the bartender what his favorite dishes were on the menu and the bartender was quite snippy. Said he wouldn't \"do that anymore\"...the hubs persisted and the bartender seemed quite irritated and proceeded to name pretty much every item on the menu. I think both of us were too taken aback to be upset, I was really amused to be honest. He had also taken our drink order and we thought he went to make it and then came back about 6 minutes later and said \"so what'll it be?\" LMAO. We said, oh we ordered and we are just doing drinks. He said \"oh I know, I just forgot what you ordered\". This dude was a character -- but he certainly colored our experience! Everyone has bad days.  We sat for dinner in the neatly appointed dining room. Love the high ceilings. I wish I could remember our server's name because she was phenomenal. She had great wine recommendations and superb salesmanship. She also made up for the grumpy ass bartender.   For small plates we ordered the Vietnamese salad (a little salty for my taste, a pinch less salt and I would have been raving about it -- it has some of my favorite things in it: shrimp, calamari, avocado, tomato, yum). The hubs had the octopus ravioli appetizer and it was probably one of the best things that we had tried there. So good, rich creamy tomato and white wine broth. The octopus was seasoned and cooked to perfection. Our friends had the cauliflower app, which was like a breaded and baked to perfection with a squeeze of lemon juice goodness. Best prep of cauliflower. They also had the burrata, creamy goodness. The gazpacho looked out of this world good -- i didn't try it but i will when I go back. Looked vine fresh!  For our entrees, I couldn't help myself and went with the falafel burger. I really couldn't decide what to order, there were so many things that I wanted to try. The falafel burger is HUGE, layered with pickled beet, goat cheese, cucumbers, on a nice chewy ciabatta. I put down half and took home half. Solid falafel, warmed up well. The fries that came with it were fantastic! The hubs had the lumacha which the server described as their answer to mac n cheese. I don't know if I found it mac n cheesy but I did find it very tasty indeed. I would probably liken it their version of spaghetti and meat sauce but much sexier. The hubs was very pleased.  We would definitely go back and I think this place is a rad spot for vegetarians as there are tons of options. They have a pretty large space and I am sure that they are much busier when the weather is nicer. I would love to try them for brunch!   Come here, just avoid the scary bartender! ;)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! It's a huge property  with a coffee bar, outdoor and indoor seating, a full bar and a dj for brunch. Every drink was tasty and every dish was outstanding. The breakfast chimi was flavorful, the hash was delicious and the quiche was light, yet filling. The breakfast potatoes are not to be missed!"}
{"text":"Very trendy great ambience  with a diverse electric menu. Huge wine list and bar list (I never knew the Japanese distilled native whiskey..its great!).  The bar crew are very friendly and Jesse was  is creative mixologist"}
{"text":"I've been here twice already for brunch and both times have been equally amazing.   The atmosphere and layout of this place are so unique. It's worth it to get here a little early to walk around and check it out. Stop by the coffee shop and grab some coffee. The two girls that run the coffee shop are so nice and helpful! My first time here, we ordered our food from the coffee bar and just found a seat at a picnic table instead of waiting for the dining area.  Our second time here, I brought my father for his birthday. He loved this place as much as I did. He stopped by the coffee shop and tried the mole mocha which has great chile chocolate flavor.   Things to order: If you order something that doesn't come with hash browns, do yourself a favor and order a side of them to share with the table! The blue corn pancakes, roasted cauliflower, chimichanga and breakfast burger are some of my favorites.   Both times we have been here with a group of people and we all tried each other's dishes. You really can't go wrong with anything you order. Good portions and great flavor!"}
{"text":"Adding to my long list of reasons I love this place - charred sweet potato with pickled shallots and passilla pumpkin salsa- OMG! - smoked beets with ricotta and pistachios- delish - smoked salmon with dill creme, capers, and tea egg  Everything... so... good..."}
{"text":"Found a sweet new place-check it out! They have inside and outside brunch and dinner plus a coffee bar, bier garten  and a lot of cool outside space with bistro lights and a fireplace for those cool evenings to sit and chill with your friends or loved one..best part of all..they are fur baby friendly!! The service was a little slow especially with coffee refills but the food was presented well and tasted excellent! The price was more than your standard diner but appropriate for more high end brunch, service and ambience."}
{"text":"I had heard a lot of great things about this place and couldn't wait to try it. My husband and i decided to stop by for Sunday brunch and let me say it lived up to all the hype. The inside is small but who wants to be inside when you can sit outside in the amazing AZ wether and a beautiful outside patio. Because it was our first time we asked our server for suggestions and she was happy to do so other than she everything is good so you will have no bad choices. we had pancake skillet that was so unique but outstanding. It's a large portion and perfect for 2 to share  it was moist and fluffy the fruit compote was very delicious. Pancake skillet with a hash brown side. Yes please!! Really hard to explain the hash brown but i will be ordering them over and over!  The parking can be a little tough but don't give it's worth it. Also, sit outside of you can it has just a great feel. Before we left the owner stopped by Dave Johnson and was such kind and graceful man. Thanks Dave!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix, Ocotillo is the place for you if you love amazing seasonal and local food. This restaurant was our place of choice to have Mother's Day brunch today. I have eaten here several times before and like always it did not disappoint! I got the Avocado Toast with Smoked Salmon and the Cauliflower which were both amazing and flavorful but still light. Everyone in our party got something different so it was fun to sample everyone's food (everything was fantastic). Only bad comment on our trip today, the mimosa glasses the server brought out were dirty, and the glasses they brought out the juice in for the mimosas (which you are supposed to pour yourself) in cups that were very inefficient in terms of pouring and would have caused us to spill juice all over the table. Both problems were resolved when brought to the servers attention though he did seem a bit defensive about the juice containers at first. Overall a great dining experience, I will definitely be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Our Saturday brunch exceeded our expectations!  Although we made a reservation for our party of 9, we had to sit outside because we had kids and the tables indoor are too high for high chairs.    Outdoor sitting was good although a bit hot.  There are long communal wood tables and string lights.  Food came out fast and warm:  * We had the avocado toast to start and it was delicious. Avocado, grape tomatoes, cilantro perfectly combined onto toasted bread  * The Pancake on a skillet was very fluffy and big enough to share. Topped with berry compote, and served with a side of butter and agave syrup.  * My Melon salad with burrata, nuts and honey dressing was very refreshing and delicious.   *Ribeye steak with fried eggs and hash brown was very tasty and cooked perfectly although a bit more rare than the term we asked for  *Brisket: only had a bite and it was full of flavor and tender  *Ginger lemongrass lemonade was sweet and refreshing  Service was friendly and attentive. Recommended!"}
{"text":"We were visiting a friend who is in the hospital in Phoenix and wanted to find a nice restaurant nearby.  Using Yelp made it so easy where it shows the distance from our current location.  We chose Ocotillo after looking at the menu and reviews.  The restaurant is beautifully decorated both indoors and out.  The menu has a lot of yummy options.  All of us wanted to order with pasta with the brussels sprouts but did not have it available.  We chose another pasta dish that was excellent.  We were in a hurry to get back to the hospital and didn't have a chance to order anything else but looks at the other tables.  All the dishes looked yummy.  The only drawback are the flies.  We sat inside and the flies were constantly at our table."}
{"text":"If I could give two different reviews, one for the food and the other for the service, I would.    I've now been to Ocotillo twice.  First time I went there was with coworkers for lunch during the week.  There were five of us and one toddler.  We sat indoors.  The service was great. Our waiter came back several times to make sure that we were okay, before our other friend arrived.  The food arrived on time and we all enjoyed our meals.  I got the fish and fries.  I don't recall the name of it on the menu, but it was cooked perfectly and was very flavorful.  My friends all enjoyed theirs as well.  Atmosphere was great and by the time we left lunch, the place was packed.  Lots of conversation and everyone seemed happy.  Second time I went to Ocotillo was yesterday and that's where the 3 stars come in.  We had a seat outside.  The weather was spectacular.  We were sat by the hostess and had glasses for water sitting empty for 10 minutes+ from when we first sat down.  Finally someone stopped by to give us some water.  Then another 5 or so minutes before someone came over to us to take our drink orders.  By this time, I was starving so I ordered an appetizer.  We ordered the ceviche which was delicious.  I mean very unique take on any ceviche I've ever had.  Scallops and grapefruit in a shell.  Really nice presentation too.  We finally ordered our food.  I ordered a ribeye and fried eggs with hash browns, my boyfriend ordered the brisket.  Both were very tasty.  The ribeye, however was very fatty.  I know that ribeye is a fattier cut of meat, but I'm not a huge fan of that kind of marbleing throughout the meat.  The whole meal really was tasty though.  And then when we finished our meal, we waited for a server for at least 20 minutes before we saw anyone again.  We did want another drink and waited for a long while for that.  When we finished that... it was easily close to another 20 minutes before we saw someone to give us our check... and then another long while to get someone to take our money.  My boyfriend went up to pay instead.    Great food at this place, but the service outdoors was kind of crummy.  They staff was really nice, but just very very very slow... and at times not very attentive.  We'll be back, but may not sit outdoors next time.  Btw, I actually made reservations both times."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and keep forgetting to write a review!  OOPS!  Loved the breakfast and dinner selections.  The service is awesome and the food is changing with the seasons.  I ordered one of the quiche and they were out, hum!  The garlic hash brown was saltier than I liked.  Crispy Chicken Meatballs are so flavorful and good.  It is a MUST order!  The housemade pastas are delicious!!!  Desserts are yummy too!  I need to come back to keep trying more food!!!"}
{"text":"A bit expensive, but worth it. I love the space, both inside and out. Ate dinner there last  week. My salad was great, and the gingerbread  ice  cream sandwich was fantastic."}
{"text":"Great food. Fresh ingredients. Great flavor. Falafel sandwich and Fattoush salad were amazing. Great service. Nice outdoor patio.  I am from sonoma county where we have tons of great restaurants. This ranks among them."}
{"text":"We love, Love, LOVE this restaurant and highly recommend it. It's our new destination restaurant. The food is delectable, the service impeccable and the owners clearly know what they are doing.   Be sure to stop here. This is an awesome place and you are in for a culinary treat!"}
{"text":"The building and atmosphere was pretty nice, but the menu choices and prices weren't all that. We ordered a few beers and the feta appetizer and walked out for $40. Long story short, there are plenty of other fish in the sea. Won't be back!"}
{"text":"Seasonal food, fun trendy spot.    Parking: There's a lot towards the east of the restaurant. I didn't see this initially.   Location: Near 3rd St and Osborn  Service: Pretty good but kinda corny.  The wait staff also didn't believe me when I asked about a salad that was *clearly* on their current web site menu.  He acted like I was an idiot, but the online menu truly did have some foods that were not listed on the paper/in person menu.  However, besides that, he was friendly; food arrived quite quickly.    Atmosphere: The flooring and walls do not absorb sound. It is hard to hear.  Also, some tables are rather too close to each other. I could hear everything the people next to us were saying.   Food/drinks:  I had a salad with squash and pomegranate seeds.  It was super tasty!  The sweet potato with apples was warm and flavorful.    Cost: The cost was somewhat high, but suspect this is due to seasonal local food options.  The food was delicious and flavorful. The servings are quite large. Be prepared to take home leftovers"}
{"text":"The food  here is absolutely amazing! Stopped in for lunch and ordered the roasted cauliflower and halibut ceviche. Both were so good I got the chills. I would be confident ordering anything on the menu here! One of my new favorites."}
{"text":"I've been here twice for lunch. First time was a business lunch, we had high expectations given the paying party's glowing recommendation before we arrived.  100% on the mark. Brisket sandwich with a killer soup (sorry, can't remember what it was now) and supurb service.  Returned today to celebrate our son's 25th birthday. We both had the amazing Ibeza Prosciutto sandwich. I threw the dice and went for the soup, son went with excellent shoestring fries. Soup was potato sausage, was more tomato than potato for me, but it's because they stretch to be different. Great draft beers, excellent time!  We will be back for dinner! Son lives three blocks away and I work three blocks in the other direction.  A nice jewel!"}
{"text":"Seriously one of the coolest restaurants around. Amazing atmosphere filled with very gracious staff. It's incredible how classy this place is but feels so comfortable to be in--almost like you're gathering to eat at a family reunion, the only difference being how incredible the food is. The menu is inspired and widely incorporates an exquisite variety of seasonal choices sourced from the valley! The bar does an excellent job preparing very full and delicious drinks as well as pairing a careful selection of wines to the dishes (ask for Dave for a special sommelier service).   The prices may be high, but this place is a testament to \"you get what you pay for.\" I have spent thousands here and don't regret a single penny."}
{"text":"Our food and service was top notch. Our waiter was extremely attentive and personable! We were there for a birthday party on a Saturday with about 20 people including kids. The server took our kids order first which we highly appreciated. A fed kid makes a parent happy! This was our first time there and it superseded our expectations!"}
{"text":"WOW! I can not rave about this place enough. The use of worldly flavors and local produce really make this place a must see in the downtown Phoenix area.   Great architecture and layout, beautiful dining room and fun community beer garden. We sat at the bar while we waited for a table to open up. We had two signature cocktails, a play on a banana daiquiri and a grilled pineapple infused vodka martini. Both phenomenal.   When we sat for dinner our server started us off with a couple appetizers, one was a roasted Cauliflower with an Aleppo pepper vinaigrette. To die for! For our main course we decided to do family style per our servers suggestion, allowing us to try more than one dish. My favorite was the whole crispy sea bass. Two thumbs up!!  Ocotillo is one of my favorite spots in the Phoenix area, And I love bringing new friends to show off this place."}
{"text":"Pretty cool atmosphere but I will say, it's just a tab bit trendy for my taste. Too many skinny jeans and man buns. Waiter was friendly and attentive, which was a huge plus. Food presentation was awesome, the food itself was different. They definitely know how to combine flavors that compliment each other. Glad we checked it out, not sold that I will go back."}
{"text":"The Brunch Ninja Eli rocks!  The food and drink are great and Eli brings it all up a notch.  Personable, professional, fun and friendly. Great service Eli!"}
{"text":"Given we have a 1 year old daughter, the selection of which restaurants are 'yay' or 'nay' is much trickier these days. Nevertheless, we braved Ocotillo given its great reviews for Sunday brunch. The atmosphere was relaxed - we overlooked just how much outdoor seating there was, and with hindsight we may have sat outside, but our indoor table suited our group just fine.  The food was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance... DJ during brunch hours is an added bonus.  Great food presentation. My only complaint is the men's room lacks privacy from the beer garden. If you're standing at the urinal and the door flings open folks may see your sunshine!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat. Amazing brunch and great entrees for dinner. Their drink selection is huge, so this is a great place to entertain out-of-towners especially on their patio when it's nice out. The waiters are always amazing. I've been about a half-dozen times and my only complaint is the hostesses always seem annoyed to be there."}
{"text":"I went here on a Sunday and tried all of the lighter options. The roasted cauliflower was my fave but everything else was great too. I had the young coconut with a shot of sailor jerry and that was perfect for a beautiful Sunday afternoon. Service was awesome and I love the layout of the whole place. Good job!"}
{"text":"Great place to spend some money for \" haut cuisine\". Some tasty snacks at lunch time with almost empty restorant and very crowded in the evening. Poor chances that you'll easily find a place. Please book in advance."}
{"text":"Incredible service, great ambiance, and out of this world food! The Ocotillo Chicken is NOT to be missed. If you're looking for a unique and incredible Phoenix restaurant experience, Ocotillo is the BEES KNEES."}
{"text":"The restaurant has such a cool concept with different themes and tons of parking. We decided to make reservations for brunch since we didn't know if we would be welcomed with a wait.   We sat inside and it was such a nice day! Our server at first, was awesome. Hubby ordered the Nutella iced coffee with boba. He came back to us with coffee that didn't have boba and since they ran out, the coffee was on the house. The coffee was pretty good! I bet it would be awesome with the boba!   We then proceeded to order the iron skillet pancake with berries and the truffle quiche. The truffle quiche was good and it came with a small salad. The iron skillet pancake was enormous and it could probably feed at least 2-3 people! In my opinion, I wasn't a big fan of the pancake - it was just too thick and I didn't like the taste.   Once the food was delivered to us, we didn't see our server at all. We ate our food, plates were being taken off of our table, a box was given to us for leftovers....and no server to give us the check! We start looking for him and watching his every move until finally, we made eye contact after 10 minutes of being done.   Our bill came to a little over $22. I love the concept, but I think the service and food can improve a little bit.  Warning: you may get a nasty message from the owner if you write a three star review or below. Because I'm kind, I will not deduct any stars to my original review based on this behavior from the owner."}
{"text":"I have been to brunch here a couple of times and the food is always amazing!  This past weekend, I ordered the breakfast flautas, which are filled with green chili pork and delicious! My friend ordered the potato frittata, which I thought was even better! I also loved that they had fresh coconut water, served in a coconut! However, the service leaves a little bit to be desired. I had to ask for more coffee several times, our cups were constantly empty. The waiter was unable to provide any suggestions when I asked for food recommendations. He said he was new and unfamiliar with the menu. Before a server ever interacts with a customer, they should be familiar with the menu and able to name the most popular dishes. He also wasn't sure if the kitchen could make poached eggs, when I asked for my eggs poached instead of fried. They are very lucky that their food and atmosphere is so great!"}
{"text":"Had never been here before but I got two completely unsolicited recommendations for this place, so had to try it out.  Made a reservation for 2 @ 7:30pm on a Wednesday night with OpenTable. We arrived 15 mins early and were warmly greeted and told our table would be ready \"in just a few minutes\" so we went to the bar and ordered a drink. At 7:45pm I asked the hostess if our table was ready, she replied \"they are cleaning it off now, I'll come get you in just a second\". Back to the bar. At 8:00 the hostess approached us and said \"your table just cleared and it would be just a few more minutes to get it cleaned off.\"  We were sat at 8:10, 40 minutes after a confirmed reservation.  Not a good start.   The waiter was super friendly and gave us a couple of his personal favorites. We both went with the Short Rib Ravioli. It was absolutely decadent...Perfection!  Overall: The place is very cool...big open spaces with some rustic vibes, yet very modern and clean. There is an outside patio with misters that looked very nice too, but it was closed.  The food was awesome, but the reception/wait for a table really made the evening frustrating."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. We came for dinner on a Saturday evening around 7-ish, They changed 3 different waiters for us, and all 3 were super slow. When we ordered drinks plus some food, the waiter came back 3 times with bad news.They ran out of sparkling water, ran out of Mexican draft beer and ran out of brussel sprouts...how do you run of out these things on a Saturday evening when you  know it will be busy? I waited for my pepsi for like 20 minuets, it came in a very small glass which only lasted 5-6 sips and never got a refill of any kind. The food was very basic at best. My wife and her friend only ate 1/2 of their salads because there was nothing in them and no flavor at all. Way overpriced for what it is. I give it 2 stars because their outside patio looks nice, otherwise mehh. I'm not going back."}
{"text":"Had brunch here yesterday, and the food was really good. The only thing was that deducted a star was the extremely slow service. It really wasn't that busy because of the parade closing off a lot streets near by. I definitely recommend the Breakfast Chimichanga. It's big but super good!"}
{"text":"YOU GUYSSSSSSSSSS.  This place is bomb.  My best friend and i have been coming in for almost a year now and i honestly dont have a single complaint about this place. Service has always been on point here. We usually sit at the bar and it has always been a party. Recently came in on a sunday on the 18th.They were pretty damn busy but stilll so attentive and personable when it came to accommodating us and the rest of the customers.   10/10 recommend!!!!!"}
{"text":"Every single bite of every single dish we ordered was amazing! Great pasta, freshly made,  salads are delicious and nuanced, Hatch chile hummus rocks! Spanish gin and tonic will get me back here for sure."}
{"text":"Yum! Great, varied menu, beer and wine list. There's something for everyone at Ocotillo. The casual atmosphere has a nice buzz but is still relaxing. Several fire pits on a cold night were quite welcome. Our waiter Josh, a transplant from another well-known local restaurant chain, is on top of his game at Ocotillo. Looking forward to returning soon and to visiting Starlite, Dave Johnson's new bbq spot in south Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Great meal and unique specialty drinks. Our server was Joshua- excellent service, knew the menu. Highly recommend this eatery!"}
{"text":"I came here with some friends based off word of mouth, not looking at the menu prior. Let's just say wow! I wasn't particularly impressed with the menu looking at it, but ordered the Ocotillo Chicken. I would say it was maybe one of the best chickens I have had prepared. Comparable to the Elements at Sanctuary. Everyone else loved their food. The big plates might be a bit spency- but easily shareable between two with an appetizer.  Next time I am getting the ribs! They looked amazing."}
{"text":"Got dinner here for the first time last night and was very impressed. Walked in to a big group gathered in the foyer area, which we later learned was a corporate event, but were greeted immediately by the hostess with a smile. We were quickly shown to our seats and approached by our server (so nice and professional). Service was quick yet attentive. All the staff was friendly and welcoming, they have an all-around cool vibe going on. The food was phenomenal. Started with the roasted cauliflower, the hype is real. I got the lumache pasta which was presented in an iron skillet--amazing! The other people I was with got the pork shank which fell right off the bone. Welcoming, great ambience, professional and delicious. Our expectations were more than exceeded and everyone had a great time, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I cannot wait to return. I came with two other women and we shared three small plates (all veggies) just to nibble while we chatted for an hour or so on a late evening. OH my goodness, each plate was to die for- literally the best \"side dishes\" I've ever tasted. Great job, chef. Looking forward to returning for an actual meal.  Also love the modern atmosphere and feel of the dining space."}
{"text":"Great place to come for brunch on the weekends. Love their dog friendly patio. Really looking forward to the cooler temps so I can spend more time there with my bf and our pups. Highly recommend for a Sunday funday!"}
{"text":"This is the place to go to celebrate vegetables. Beets, cauliflower, broccoli, side dishes are amazing. The veggies are the stars and wonderfully done."}
{"text":"Place it's beautiful! Very nice outside sitting! Lots of fresh local veggies on the menu! Their falafel burgués it's to die for! Good selection of wines and spirits! Love coming to this place!"}
{"text":"This is THE place to go for a gastronomical orgasm!  The food is spectacular.  Beef cheeks were exceptional.  Gives Balthazar in NYC a run for their money.  Not a snooty place.  Perfect for true foodies that appreciate quality.  Not for the unsophisticated palate. Traveled from Dallas, TX.  Would actually plan a trip back here just for the next \"chefs special.\"  Thank you Greg & Deenie for introducing me to this fab place.  It was a night filled with joy!  Until next time...."}
{"text":"What a wonderful addition to the valley!! Creative cocktails- enjoyed both the sazerac and the gin & tonic with juniper berries. My husband and I loved the cabbage salad and the cucumber salad- delicious and tasty ingredients and dressings! Then we shared the crispy whole fish and it was so special with a red curry sauce on the side- loved the shishito peppers too.  Ended the meal with sorbet that was great- refreshing in the Phx heat for sure. Thanks Ocotillo for a great date night- we'll be back! Oh yes- John, our server was really attentive too."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch on a super busy Sunday so we ended up sitting at the outdoor bar and absolutely loved our experience. Our food was some of the best brunch food we've had in Phoenix for quite some time and the menu was fairly large! The actual space was beautiful, hip, and so much bigger than expected. Our bartender/server was AWESOME, despite how slammed she was. Great spot for a large group brunch but I can't wait to come back for dinner!"}
{"text":"Excellent, attentive service. Our table was inside but the outdoor space was amazing. Food was unique, flavorful and perfectly prepared and surprisingly generous portions! Despite not usually ordering chicken at restaurants, I decided to try the Mesquite Grilled Ocotillo Chicken...wow! Seriously must have said \"this is SO good\" at least a dozen times. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Horrendous service! The waitstaff has their head else where other than on the clientele. Had to ask for multiple items on multiple occasions; sugar substitutes? Silverware? Are you kidding me, the basics! I had to ask for creamer for my coffee, AND then a spoon to mix it with!!! The food was flavorful, but the sour taste the waitstaff left, left me with no real sense of ever returning."}
{"text":"Well third time was not a charm. We went due to a gift card for fifty dollars.  We were seated outdoors per request at a table that rocked due to the uneven deck.  Our waitress was slow.  She kept asking me if I wanted my burger exactly like my wife's.  No, hers is Ellen done with nothing on it.  Mine is medium with everything.  She brought whit wine instead of red. Hard to believe.  She disappeared without taking the next two closest tables order. They just sat there. Her skills set was lacking.  The beef was tasty.  We heard comments from those nearby that there was a hundred twenty five dollar steak on the menu.  Most took it as a joke.  We heard them say the most ever paid was fifty five dollars in the past.  Perhaps it was the loud special event in the courtyard that contributed to an unpleasant evening. The bad news is we still have twenty left on the gift card."}
{"text":"Super sad to say this was just ok. I had the salmon ceviche and it was pretty ...ordinary. Not sure if it was an off night. The fish seemed fresh but the accoutrements didn't add anything to the dish. I wish it had more acid, heat and or salt. It was pretty bland surprisingly.   I also had the Campanelle pasta. This was HUGE but again a little bland. The sauce looked cheesy and had a good amount of mushrooms but needed a lot of flavor. It was also very ugly. I know taste should rank higher than looks but for such a \"trendy\" place I expected more."}
{"text":"I'm updating my review!  The food was great and the wait staff was fast and friendly.  I had witnessed an exchange between two employees that was 100% unacceptable in front of customers.  HOWEVER... since my previous review, the general manager reached out to me, and with total transparency and humility, very much impressed upon me his sincerest intentions to ensure the issue didn't happen again.  That kind of ownership goes a LONG ways!    I would recommend Ocotillo, and will visit again soon."}
{"text":"We hosted an engagement celebration last night, and the whole experience was wonderful. We had an issue that came up and ended up having to scramble to find a place to host our party, and Walt was really great at helping us get everything organized with just a week's notice. He reserved the Chef's Ramada for us, and it was beautifully set up when we got there. Eli was our server and he was so friendly and accommodating and did a great job serving our large party. Most of the party was just drinking, but I did order the pita and hummus plate and it was amazing-much more decadent than a traditional hummus plate. Some of our guests ordered entrees and said they were all delicious! The drinks were all very yummy and I was super impressed by the very reasonable prices on drinks! It was a perfect place to celebrate and all 30 of our guests left happy and satisfied. I really appreciated the ability to split checks, and again just how accommodating everyone was throughout the experience. And it was such a beautiful, perfect ambiance. Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!  Food is fresh, interesting and affordable.  Campus with the gabion walls and landscaping is stylish yet comfortable.  Try the brussel sprout tartine.  It's incredible!  Staff is great.  Overall, my new favorite!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. The food always taste amazing and the ingredients are so fresh! I had heard about the chef through the industry and was not disappointed when I saw the menu and was thrilled with my visit & since have been back many times. Our favorite server is MacAllister! He is so much fun and is extremely knowledgeable on the menu and wine and made our experience very memorable. We can't wait to return and enjoy the amazing staff and food. Thank you so much MacAllister for making our experience so amazing!!"}
{"text":"This was the first time I tried this place . The ambiance is fun and has a nice vibe. There was a 30-45 minute wait at 1:30pm ( damn Arizonans and their love for brunch). Our server was fantastic! He was knowledgable and gave great suggestions! We had the blue corn pancake and would recommend that to everyone walking through the door! I had the fried mozzarella sandwich and it was mediocre at best. It lacked flavor. I wouldn't order it again. I am looking forward to trying some of the other dishes. But will definitely make a reservation!!!"}
{"text":"What a great concept! The food was great. My buddy's food was good too, but just warm not hot. I can't wait to try the dinner menu. This is the new go to place for small and large parties."}
{"text":"Update: after seeing my initial one-star review, the owner reached out on Yelp and asked that I give him a call. I spoke to him today and he was very helpful. He clearly explained the changes that going on with their ticketing system, but fully took responsibility for the fact that things should've gone better during our meal. He invited us back to give it another try on the house, and I told him I really appreciated the offer but more importantly the acknowledgment of the frustration that we had. Upgrading to four stars for solid recovery."}
{"text":"The waitress very patient and accommodating to my food allergies (which is SO rare). She knew the ins and outs of every single dish, including the ingredients in dressings and sauces. The food was absolutely delicious, too! So happy to have found this gem. If you, too, have food allergies/sensitivities, you'll be safe and happy here! I'll definitely be coming back again. (P.S.... you can get bottomless mimosas for brunch. So great!)"}
{"text":"I almost died from coolness when I walked into this place. The indoor space is hip, but the outside....! A space near the bar, a grassy area, a traditional patio....all with a very modern farmhouse feel. Our group included lots of babies and little kids, and the space was perfect for keeping them entertained. The service was very friendly and a very slight delay was totally excusable since they had only been open 2 weeks, and we came in a group of 12. The beer and cocktail list is pretty cool. They have a wide selection for decent prices, and include a bottomless mimosa option ($15? $20? I can't remember....). We also shared a big bottle of beer...a saison that was pretty good, wish I could remember the name. The brunch food overall was good, not great. Pancakes and breakfast chimi were just ok. The bread pudding and burger were pretty good. Where Ocotillo really shined was their veggies. Loved both the zucchini and the cauliflower. Can't wait to sit outside when the weather gets a little cooler at happy hour.  Note to Ocotillo management: are you planning to add some misters/fans in the outside space??? It could use it! Also, there seemed to be a lot of flies out the morning we were there. I don't know if there's anything you can do about that...."}
{"text":"We had reservations, and were seated right away.  My son has been here and recommended it highly. With all of the hype and great reviews I was a little let down.  The ambience is as wonderful as everyone says.  I ordered the Tartine and the Carrot Fattoush Salad. They were both generous servings, I would have been better off only ordering one. Both were dressed too heavily. Without such heavy dressing, the flavors of the dishes would have been easier to taste, and they would have been much better.  The service was very good.  My friend ordered the cauliflower that everyone raves about, it was great.  It was pretty expensive."}
{"text":"Amazing food and a great wine list. All food is local and organic so menu changes. Great service and great food earns 5 stars for sure!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great spot for brunch.  Super kid friendly.  Lots of space for them to run around.  Menu changes seasonally, favorite thing on the menu now is either the duck confit salad or the Iberico ham sandwich."}
{"text":"Wow, really awesome restaurant layout. Went for brunch on a Saturday and they had a DJ playing really good music nothing like a dance club lol. I wasn't to happy with the food I got. I got the Mexican food egg mixture-I forget what it is called. I was a little disappointed with the flavors. I would go back for dinner or lunch and give it another try."}
{"text":"We went to Ocotillo for our Christmas weekend brunch having been there for lunch and dinner in the past and the food being amazing. Brunch was not great. We were seated right away as it wasn't too busy when we arrived. After being seated it took around 10 minutes for the our drinks order to be taken. When the drinks arrived we ordered our food: the steak/potato cake, french toast, fruit platter and ricotta/beet salad. Our food arrived timely, but without silverware. By the time our silverware got to the table the food was cold (we had requested previously before food arrived). We ate some of it but at this point had become disinterested so decided to take it to go. Our waiter had disappeared again and so after a further 10 minutes we asked another passing waiter for to go boxes. The boxes arrived and within seconds of that our waiter had the bill on the table and it was back in record time to be signed and get us out. The service was appalling and not what we've had in the past at Ocotillo. The food was sub par...it being cold did not help matters."}
{"text":"This was not my first time at Ocotillo, and I like coming here. 2 weekends ago we had brunch here and the food is good. They have a variety of breakfast and brunch items. My review is as follows for this visit:   1- Reception: The hostes received us warmly with a smile, and as soon as our party was completed we were given the available options and were seated right away.  2- Service: Our server was very friendly and kind. She made sure we were taken care of, as well as the waters and coffee were continuously refreshed/refilled. I am so sorry I do not remember her name because i think she deserves the recognition. She is worthy of my 5 stars.  3- The restaurant/facilities: I love this place, it gets my 5 stars for the set up. Restaurant was clean and the men's restroom was well attended and clean as well. The noise level can be a bit loud, especially on Sunday mornings when they have live DJ, which is a nice touch but at times it can be very loud inside.   4. The food: I got the Summer Fattoush salad which I honestly was not a fan of it. The menu description was good, and interesting because coming from a middle eastern background I know how fattoush is made but this was a modified Fattoush, with ingredients that sounded good, but when i got it, the taste was a bit off. I also made the mistake of adding chicken on the side, but even just the fattoush on its own was so overwhelming, with tons of ingredients that i could not identify each one by just tasting.Again, the description listed all the items, and i got the dish knowing whats in it, but when tasted it, the flavors did not get along very well in my opinion. Fattoush does not have corn, feta cheese, nor almonds in it, so if these were to be removed, it may make the dish more acceptable This os my personal feedback,  the dish may work for others. ."}
{"text":"Really just one of those hidden Gems! Incredible service, the ambiance is amazing and there Food is absolutely Delicious!!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite restaurants in Phoenix. Beautiful food and gorgeous dining experience. Amazing cocktails and always friendly service. Our go to when friends and family come to town. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Heard good things about this place so decided to give it a try. Excellent service and nice atmosphere. Delicious cucumber salad for appetizer. We ordered the ribs and falafel sandwich, and they both didn't wow us. They were decent tho. I wonder if we got full on the cucumber salad. Maybe try their other dishes."}
{"text":"Nice brunch drop in. Huge outdoor patio seating options, which we enjoyed. Avocado toast with smoke salmon hit the spot."}
{"text":"One of the many great breakfast/brunch places in PHX! To be honest I started writing this review over a year ago and can't remember exactly why I liked it so much but whatever you'll still read it.  Don't worry I'm going to come back"}
{"text":"The staff, food and ambiance are top notch.  We went to Ocotillo on a busy Friday night around 7 pm and were seating quickly.  The reception staff were very accomodating allowing my wife and I to have a booth instead of a smaller table for two.  The restaurant is modern industrial, a bit noisy but is very comfortable.  There are tables for small and large parties, some community tables and a large outside dining area. We were inside, but next time we plan to dine outside. The staff was very attentive.  We were greeted almost immediately by our waiter then soon after another person that may have been a manager that offered help with wine and drinks.  The menu has many options with salads, appetizers, small and big plates, and also desert.  We decided on trying the roasted beets, crispy chicken meatballs, and a lamb ragu pasta.  We ordered the beets and chicken meatballs as starters, then shared the pasta afterwards.  These three dishes exceeded my high standards, high quality and large enough for two to share.  The menu seems slanted towards Asian but the menu is eclectic. There should be enough choices for all to be happy.  One of the staff that attended the table recommended the fish and chips whilch is one of the luncheon offerings.  They also have a brunch on the weekends, which looks interesting, different but still familiar. Plan to go back soon to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"After a week of traveling through AZ and New Mexico my parter and I decided to end our trip on a high note so we came to Ocotillo for dinner. We sat outside on the front patio and the temperature was perfect, and so was the atmosphere. Not too loud, not TOO fancy. Our server Jana was super sweet and personable. We shared several items. The smoked beets were our favorite. They were so rich and earthy and I could have eaten them all day. The sweet potatoes were delicious as well with a very unique and flavorful sauce. We also had the Ocotillo chicken which was large (a half chicken), tender, and well seasoned. We had a bottle of champagne (yay birthdays) and shared a dessert (the pound cake with lemon curd and blueberries). We both left full (but not exploding), and sooooo happy. Definitely above my expectations and one of the better meals I have had in a while. Love the seasonal menu, veggie options, and the kind staff. Plus the restaurant is like a cool steel and stone compound with great style. They were having two events during our dinner and we didn't feel crowded, rushed, or anything. If I even find myself in Phoenix again I will be back!"}
{"text":"What a great CenPho gem!  Happy hour prices are reasonable, staff is attentive and friendly.  I was with a group of about 12 people celebrating a birthday and not once did we have to ask twice for something. The staff is great and the food was spot on."}
{"text":"Have been here for lunch and dinner multiple times. Two things are always consistent; the quality of the food and, sadly, the heightened annoyance of the million flies that also want to enjoy my food and beverage.   Please. For the love of all that is holy in the world of hospitality and restaurant management- please get rid of all the flies (and gnats) in your restaurant.   The last few times I've been in for lunch or beverages after work, I've been unable to enjoy my time save for swatting away flies every few minutes because...gross. In fact, I've even witnessed the boss man/owner take a small air gun out and shoot the flies on the wall. You sir, get all kinds of side eye for that. No, thank you - I will pass on the bear grylls fly appetizer.   The solution lies in your ventilation issues. You don't have enough positive pressure occurring inside your building and your doors are too slow to close; therefore, not only are you letting the pesky buggars in, you're not doing enough to push them out. Your open kitchen concept is probably contributing to this as well - and with as many flies that are in the dining room, i shudder to think what's buzzing around your kitchen.   I can't come back until you've solved this problem. Which really blows, because your cauliflower is some next level madness. Two stars is all I can muster - fix your flys with some traps or a blue light buzzer and I'll be back with 3 more stars in my pocket."}
{"text":"We went here last Saturday evening for our 40th High School reunion. The outdoor area was set up beautifully and easily accommodated our group of approximately 150 people for milling around, visiting and buffet style dinner service. The servers were extremely helpful, friendly and professional - especially Eli. Unique and delicious appetizers were offered during the cocktail hour, followed by an excellent selection on the buffet. I'm not usually a fan of buffets, but everything I tried was delicious. Particularly tasty were the Ocotillo Chicken, the Roasted Cauliflower and Kale and the Potatoes Au Gratin. I did not have a chance to look at their other menus, but based on this experience, I would guess they have lots of great options. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"There was a lot of new stuff going on near downtown these days hopefully they can all look at this place and model off of it it's fun it's a lively the place is wide open outdoors and perfect for Arizona had the brisket sandwich sorry for no picture and an amazing salad.  Our server John was very informative and friendly and kept the drinks, and great job guys will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Decided to go on a girls night with a friend of mine the day of on a Saturday. We were on Yelp and were looking for a place in Phoenix area since we're never on that side of town. Came across Ocotillo and I remembered seeing that they won 'best new restaurant' either this or last year - so we decided to try it out. I called to make sure there was not a wait and the hostess told me that when during spring season reservations will need to be made 1.5 wks in advance, but since it was Summer it wasn't too bad. She put my name down on the waitlist and told me there was a 30 min wait. Perfect! We were about 20 mins away from my house.  When we first walked in, noticed the restaurant was huuuge, with patio seating and even a bar outdoors! I could tell why she said it was slow season, the patio was empty but inside the restaurant was LOUD and packed with groups of people! We started with drinks - Moscow Mule & my friend ordered Pimms something - her drink was really good! It was fruity and made with ginger syrup - it was refreshing. The server told us the plates were made to be shared - we got two small plates, seared octopus and scallops. The seared octopus was cooked perfectly, but I've had better sauces with it. This tasted like it was latin influenced and much bolder taste than what I've had in other similar restaurants. I liked the scallops though - it tasted like it had a white wine light sweet sauce with it, the basil topped with it made it really good as well. Rock shrimp pasta was our next course, this is a white wine sauce and had a slight limey taste to it. Odd, cause I've never had it in a pasta, but it was VERY GOOD! The shrimp wasn't big as I thought it would be, but it was still crunchy and flavorful. For dessert, we ordered the brownie with roasted marshmallow and graham crackers. It was a huuge marshmallow on top of a warm stone plate. The sweetness on the brownie was perfect, but I wish it had more brownie than marshmallow. I also thought the graham cracker was just o-kay.  All in all, I would definitely recommend this place for a group of 4-5 people for shareable plates and a place to hangout!"}
{"text":"The restaurant atmosphere and decor are nice.   Service was on the slow side but I didn't want to dock them points because we came in a big group and they were in a middle of a big rush so it's understandable. It did take them about 30 mins to seat us even with reservations and beverage and food delivery was extremely slow. Our meal took over 3 hours from seating to receiving bill which is way too long.   What was really disappointing was the food. They changed their menu up and this new menu was definitely not what I was expecting or hoping for after seeing all the good reviews about the past menu.   Linguine - noodles were cooked perfect and the texture of the noodles were on point however the sauce was lacking flavor.   Ravioli - cooked perfect, wrapped well and the meat inside was delicious .  Spicy duck - the flavoring on it was really nice however it was severely undercooked inside to the point where the meat wasn't even warm. The outside cooked pieces that I did have taste well.   Smoked salmon- it was good. Nothing out of ordinary, just a good smoked salmon app.   Duck confit salad - tasted good , duck was cooked nice and ingredients tasted fresh.   Beef ribs- nicely seasoned and well cooked ."}
{"text":"Yummy! Came here with a friend for lunch and we loved the setup and how open the space is. I've been wanting to try this place for a while and I'm glad we made it out here. I ordered the banh mi sandwich which has fried tofu, cucumbers, carrots, mint, peanut sauce and other good stuff. It was really good and big enough that I took half of it with me to go. It came with fries which I liked, and those could've been substituted. My friend got a veggie dish with asparagus, cheese and more veggies and she enjoyed her food.   Wanted to try their Nutella iced coffee boba but they were out of boba, so sad. Gotta come back to try it and some of the other dishes! Service was timely and friendly."}
{"text":"We were visiting from out of town and was looking for a good brunch with specialty cocktails, we were greatly impressed! Definitely would come back! Great food and even better service."}
{"text":"Lunch and dinner, AWESOME.   Foods are not factory foods.  Each dish is artful, delicious and full of surprises.   The Roasted Beet salad is on my order everytime.    I recently ordered the salmon, WOW.   The skewered pork bellies were utterly sublime.   They changed up the dessert menu so I missed the chocolate cobbler and bread pudding, but the ricotta pound cake with lemon curd, berries, and toasted fresh made marshmallow was pretty darn good. I had a new signature martini with ginger, peach and pomegranate.  They flavor layers were incredible.   The \"beer garden\" is our favorite seating, outdoor but protected from weather.  the sofas and fire pit are intimate and invite conversations.   GREAT JOB!"}
{"text":"My fiancée and I have lived within walking distance of Ocotillo for over a year and finally made the trip for brunch on Sunday. We were a little disappointed with where we were seated, at a shared picnic table with some people lamenting their hangovers and recalling some of the sketchy things they had done the night before. Apparently a reservation is recommended to sit on the patio we wanted to sit at, which we will definitely do next time. I had a couple different drinks, the hard lemonade and a mimosa, both were very good. We shared a few of the brunch options including the fried chicken with polenta, the broccolini quiche, and the breakfast chimichanga. The servings were a lot larger than we had anticipated, so next time we'll only be ordering a dish each. The quiche and the fried chicken were our favorites, but we are excited to try some of the other dishes next time! We will be back, with a patio reservation."}
{"text":"I was downtown and someone told me to meet them at Ocotillo.  I immediately wondered why they thought I'd drive 30 minutes to South of Chandler and also wondered why they were at a golf course on a Friday night.  Luckily, I figured out what they meant prior to paying $30 for an Uber.    The food/drink:  I had a pasta dish.  While the pasta was a bit chewy, the meatballs were fantastic.  The other app and entrée that was shared was enjoyed completely.  The only thing that wasn't good was the dessert, a shortcake.  It was very dry.  The menu rotates frequently and the kitchen definitely puts a lot of care into the food.  The presentation was excellent. The cocktails were creative and delicious.    Service: Fantastic.  The waiter was passionate about the restaurant and gave us several recommendations.  He was attentive and always happy.  He's exactly what a server should be.   Ambiance:  The outdoor, dog friendly space is very cool and I look forward to coming by in the spring once Phoenix isn't hotter than the surface of Venus.  The inside is sort of bland.    Value:  the cocktails run about $11, the entrees around $30 but there are plenty of options in the $20 range.  It's not cheap but the quality and service are there to justify it.  This is a great date night spot or business meal location."}
{"text":"2nd time for brunch. I had the Sicilian sausage quiche,and my spouse had the American.  Both were tasty but not outstanding, and we're not food snobs. This is a great venue and quite popular based on the crowd.  Enjoyed sitting in the patio where I could interact with nature.  Also got to eavesdrop on a very boring conversation from the only couple who have ever had a child. Lol. Cheers! $18 bottle mimosas, yum."}
{"text":"The first thought that went through my mind after being seated at Ocotillo is:  This place is freaking loud! So loud, in fact, that on a busy Saturday night, it's damn near impossible to have an actual conversation with the person sitting across from you. Although according to the owner, they will be installing panels that will resolve this problem as of August 2017.  The décor is very sleek and modern, similar to a lot of other newer restaurants that are scattered about this area. The menu at Ocotillo strongly emphasizes seasonal ingredients, so things change quite regularly from what I've been told.  My girlfriend and I had some trouble deciding what to get, as the menu is kind of all over the place, mixing a lot of pastas with meat entrees, seafood, and what most people label as \"Modern American.\" Fortunately for them, the food is (mostly) very good if you choose very carefully.  We started with an arugula salad, which had a nice balance of flavors. They could have been a bit more liberal with the cherry shallot vinaigrette, but that's just nitpicking. We both really liked their choice in goat cheese, which was also used quite heavily on their summer squash plate - probably the best thing that we tried.     I struggled at finding a main entree to order, so my girlfriend and I just simply split a pasta of bucatini, which included some pork and ricotta meatballs. Meatballs were excellent quality, while the pasta was a bit hard and incredibly difficult to pick up. The bread used was very chewy and dry, but I'd still say that it was a fairly decently made pasta - but we both agreed that it's not quite at the level of what you might find at places like Mora or Tratto.  They had three options for desserts, including a layered chocolate cake, zucchini cake, and homemade donuts, which I now regret not ordering. We opted for the chocolate cake, which was similar to a black forest-style. I thought it was okay, but nothing memorable that I'd recommend ordering again.  Our server was a nice guy who was very excited to tell us about the restaurant. Although there were some long gaps between portions, he regularly checked up on us to see what we thought about the food - probably aided by the fact that we were taking pictures of everything at all angles.  Aside from a few quips, we both agreed that it was a decent meal. Despite the poor acoustics, I really like the design of the place. Supposedly, they deliver an excellent brunch, which we might end up trying sometime down the road.  Although I wouldn't say that Ocotillo is a place for everyone, I think it fits the area just fine and will most likely continue to do very well in the future.  Recommended!"}
{"text":"I have a really poor sense of direction thinking that it would take us 5 mins to walk from our Hilton Garden Inn hotel, turns out it takes about 20 mins in the hot Phoenix sun. But enough about my issues and more about the amazing brunch I had on my last day in Phoenix. I made reservations at 1030 which I strongly recommend on the weekends. The weather was amazing and it would have been great to sit outside but that was everyone else's idea as well. So we settled for the inside and both ordered the brunch burger medium rare with what ended up being 3 mimosas. The service, food, atmosphere, and location are all fantastic. I'm glad we ended a very intoxicating weekend on such a high food note. I strongly recommend trying this restaurant out while we didn't sample everything it all looked great! Happy food hunting!!"}
{"text":"So I want to like this place but I won't go back. First off I must say that the property is beautiful, however if that's what I was looking for in a restaurant I'd eat at the desert botanical gardens.  Honestly the pita hummus plate was really good, with a giant piece of Nahn. Our server was mediocre at best and seemed to be preoccupied. When the food runner brought out our apps he didn't bother to bring plates. The server also never told us about any specials, which I guess there was discounted wine and happy hour. As far as the food goes, it was just mediocre. The beef ribs were a site to behold but not super tender and the sauce was lacking substance. The lemon linguine pasta had way too much lemon in it and for a home made pasta was just mediocre. Also, this place is LOUD. It seems to be more of a happy hour, drink spot than someplace I would ever lay down $40 for a meal. Won't be back, your food and service is wack."}
{"text":"Ocotillo is a hipster's paradise in the middle of Phoenix. Long wooden picnic benches for tables? Check. Waiters with artsy tattoo sleeves? You got it. Additional coffee bar venue stocked with White Russian Coffee Stouts? Also here.   Though I would not be a self-proclaimed hipster, I thoroughly enjoyed my brunch experience here at Ocotillo. Our server was friendly and patient with our large group of people. My dish was hearty and flavorful -- I had the smoked brisket with polenta, which was recommended by our waiter. It was a great combination of textures (creamy polenta with crispy onion strings and tender meat); however, it was a lot saucier than I imagined, almost like a soup. I also snagged a bite of the Breakfast Burger which was huge and also very well-prepared.   Overall, I enjoyed the tree-lined walkways and cool brunch patio. I also appreciate that they take reservations here!! Our large party and I left happy and full.  On my second visit: I brought my puppy, and enjoyed a nice lunch out on the patio. Ocotillo was very welcoming to him, and had water bowls prepared for their four-legged guests."}
{"text":"My friend and I have been here a few times and we've loved it. Came in last minute and was able to sit at the bar last minute. Started off with the chia parfait and it was yummmmmy. Had some mimosas and it's was a great deal. Then we shared the filet mignon and salmon mmmm mmm mmmm if was to die for. We will be back next Sunday and every Sunday after that."}
{"text":"I enjoy this place for happy hour foods and drinks. The wine list is great. Their cocktail drink is the average price for central Phoenix - and the house cocktails are delish!!! I have been to a few hosted happy hours with finger foods - I need to just order off that menu because my lunch and dinner experience has been good, just bit great.   I love the patio area. Inside can be noisy. Still - Nice place. Great service. Come here regularly and never pass up a cocktail opportunity!"}
{"text":"Great decor. Everybody enjoyed themselves.    I ordered chicken wings. They were way too spicy, I couldn't eat them. I wouldn't recommend them.  Best part of the service was, eelll, our server had great hair."}
{"text":"The only thing I like about this place is the the outdoor seating and layout. It is very big and my little ones were able to run around a bit since we adults wanted to hang out some more. The food...eh. I mean there are a few good items on there, but if you're not aware of the culinary terms that are used in the food descriptions, you're pretty much felt overwhelmed. Pretty much they needed pictures of the food to show what they are describing! I don't like how menus change from breakfast to brunch to light menu to lunch, although I may me incorrect with the menu schedule. We went last time for my mom's birthday, she was dressed in Birthday attire and all, but no suggestion or complimentary dessert for the birthday girl. We chose this particular spot for such a big reservation and not even recognition from the Manager, or waiter even."}
{"text":"Went to Ocotillo for lunch with a friend who recommended it and was not disappointed! I got the pork shoulder torta and the pork was so juicy and delicious! My friend got one of the chicken items and she enjoyed it as well. Our server was friendly and overall, a great dining experience!"}
{"text":"Over rated. Crispy fish really talked up by waitress but not worth it. Over priced as well. Decor boring, loud and crowded. Unique menu of cocktails but not enough variety. Will try different place next time"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a business lunch, was quite busy at noon but they got us a table quickly.  Had the carrot fatoosh salad and was very happy with it.  The flavors were dense and varied, it was filling and had just the right amount cheese and dressing so it was still healthy.  Exceptionally well executed.  Everything else we saw go buy looked delicious and the place is beautiful, we will be back."}
{"text":"My group and I had a poor experience on Friday, I emailed the restaurant directly on Saturday (to avoid having to post a poor review) but have yet to hear back. Our server Elizabeth was actually great up until the end of our meal. There was a group of 5 women who were dining there before a concert out at Ak Chin Pavillion. She mixed our tab up with the table next to ours, called me on my cell, and had us turn around to go back and sign a new tab when we were already on our way to the concert. She apologized profusely, and I understand that mistakes happen, but management took no ownership of this situation. We were overcharged by quite a bit, but didn't catch it since we had split the bill. She was told to relay a message to our party that the previous checks would be voided and to call back the following day to have a manager adjust something off the tab... I don't understand why this couldn't have been handled by a manager at that moment. We had already turned around after leaving, we were all confused as to why we were told to call back the following day to ASK for money back? Furthermore, I emailed to explain and give feedback and I haven't even received an acknowledgment. I just feel this could've been handled differently, and I would hope this doesn't happen for anyone else in the future."}
{"text":"The Food wasn't the best. it was just... okay. it's really the atmosphere that's nice."}
{"text":"Love love love! This place is amazing! The food is so delicious. Our server was nice. The environment was fun. We will definitely be frequenting this place."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! The prices are a bit high, but the portions are good. The roasted cauliflower is not to be missed!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent.  But that is where it ends.  Don't go there if you want to talk.  Outside picnic tables uncomfortable.  4 ounce wine pour."}
{"text":"Went with a large group and got mixed reviews. Half of the people did not like their food, a quarter really liked it, the rest stated that it was OK but would not come back. I ordered the roasted fish. It was ok, have had better at this price. Staff was very attentive and service was great. Too bad the food was not great."}
{"text":"We love the sprawling indoor outdoor articulation of space. We deeply love everything on the menu (except red meat which we don't eat. We love the helpful and informed staff. We love Ocotillo!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for brunch!  Staff is relaxed and attentive.  Food tastes delicious.  Especially the breakfast Chimichanga :)."}
{"text":"Another new restaurant that we have tried that we can check off the list.  We will not be adding it to the list of \"favs\".   I would go back to accommodate another persons desire to go, but I wouldn't go back out of choice. The food scene in Phoenix is rapidly growing, but lately I haven't been impressed.   The theme that seems to be as of late is, if the building and atmosphere is really unique and beautiful then it will make the food taste better.  Well it doesn't.   There are plenty of other restaurants that have figured out how to serve excellent food and provide a unique and beautiful building and atmosphere.  This is not one of them. The food here is just alright.   The chickens wings are served as the entire drum and wing.  Why?  It makes no sense to make \"eating\" more complicated.  It doesn't make it taste better, it just makes the person trying to eat the food frustrated. The pasta is \"meh\".  The table ordered three different pasta dishes and not one single person was impressed.   The cilantro-lime fries....don't get too excited.  These are not super crispy fries tossed in a cilantro, oil, salt, parmesan, lime bath like you were hoping for.  They are average fries served with a slice of lime for your squeezing pleasure and rather large chunks of cilantro on top.   The crispy fish for two....I was so excited about this dish.  Presentation was nice, but sharing this dish was complicated and there wasn't much substance to the meal.  I felt like I was just picking, which I could have gotten past had there been \"mind blowing flavor\" worth working so hard for. As we were leaving, I looked around and noticed a sea of empty tables and chairs.  There were so many tables and chairs that I felt overwhelmed.  It would be an incredible accomplishment for any restaurant to be able to fill this many seats.  Not sure this concept will pull it off."}
{"text":"The food is so amazing here! Seasonal, and lots of vegetarian options. Unfortunately their service is just plain horrible. Give yourself plenty of time if you want to eat here, and don't expect your server to know anything about the food. Also don't make any special requests."}
{"text":"I cannot emphasize enough what a delightful experience brunch here was!  The prices were so fair that we ordered four veggie dishes as an \"appetizer\", little did we know each of these dishes could have served as a full meal!  The beets had an outstanding Smokey flavor.  The cauliflower was the most shocking delicious, the kale pesto was rich in herb flavor and reminded me nothing of eating a salad.  The heirloom carrots... just get them.  They were my favorite thing on the entire menu.  You don't have to like carrots to enjoy this amazing dish.  The entrees were amazing, the smoked salmon must have been done in house, some of the best I've ever had.  And the frosé was not at ALL like the over-sugared slushies you get at other restaurants.  It was pleasantly tart and refreshing.  And the atmosphere was bright and relaxed, not like the overcrowded brunch spots where you can barely hear yourself speak.  I could go on for hours, I'll stop here!  Just go - trust me!"}
{"text":"W O W favorite place in Arizona so far. All the small plates are delicious we had four out of about 6 they offer. Extensive wine list, cocktails too. Highly recommend! Must stop for anyone visiting Phoenix."}
{"text":"Had a nice time checking this place out last night! We sat at the bar and ordered 2 reasonably priced cocktails, which were both very good.   Got our menus, found some food to order. Pork ribs for appetizer, which were super tender. I would of just liked more glaze, but that's more a personal preference. Still very good! I got the grilled shrimp and my fiancé got the crab pasta. I liked the fact that they had quite a few seafood options. We both ate our entire meals, so no issue on how they tasted.  We sat for a little, I mentioned it was his birthday and they offer a mini cupcake on the house with berries. It hit the spot. Jesse was helpful and attentive--never lacking anything:)   I loved how the restaurant was set up, open and with lights up the walkway. We chose to sit inside but there was plenty of outdoor sitting. My only thing would be that the lights over the bar were a little too bright for my liking. Other then that, a very nice place."}
{"text":"Went twice in one day, who does that?  A friend was in town with some guests and we needed a lunch place. The hotel concierge at the Hilton near by suggested Ocotillo.  I thought I had been here before cause we try everything new that we can in Phoenix but I was getting it confused with another place in Central Phoenix that is very good.  Anyway, after entering the restaurant and realizing it was not the place I had been to before I was intrigued, delighted, and curious.  The space itself is amazing!  We did not have any problems with the service at lunch or dinner.  So for lunch we had the beet and riccotta salad, chicken meatballs, and the pork sandwich.  Every bite including the french fries was incredible!  Sharing was really fun and satisfying cause it was hard to choose, almost every menu options sounded fabulous, our server even said she is picky eater and liked everything on the menu.  So why did we have to come back that evening you ask?  Why not!  We were still in the area and hungry again and there were so many things we wanted to try but couldn't at lunch, besides my friend would not be able to eat here again in probably a very long time.  My daughter can eat chocolate for days so she was delighted to have the chocolate raspberry parfait for lunch and the chocolate pie for dinner with some fried and meatballs for a bit of nutrition!  Great addition to Phoenix area dining.  We will definitely be back but probably just once in a day, not being independently wealthy or anything close to that!"}
{"text":"Ugh, tried it one more time and the service was just as horrendous as the first! It was so bad our server basically begged us to have a dessert on the  house. That dessert took over 30 minutes to come to us. It was almost comical at that point. I think it's safe to say I'm done with this restaurant for good."}
{"text":"Enjoyed everything from the food to the drinks and the atmosphere.  The server was excellent and friendly. The whole branzino is a must for social diners."}
{"text":"My friend had her birthday dinner here a few months ago and I was so excited to check it out. The place is huge! The outdoor space is great for private parties, while the indoor space is very trendy, loud and somewhere I could spend an entire evening.  We started with the Italian salad, chicken meatballs and the octopus. The salad was quite delicious and plenty to split between 2-3 people. The chicken meatballs were amazing as well. I did not personally try the octopus, but everybody that tried it had only great things to say about it!  For dinner, I ordered the Casarecce pasta. It was excellent. Some other items that were ordered...Reginette pasta, beef ribs and the falafel burger. Everybody was pleased with their entrees.   I will be back to try some other items on the dinner menu and would love to come for brunch!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service. Was s little disappointed with the chimichanga, it was beautiful but lacked the flavor I expected. Everyone else enjoyed their meals, the blue corn dish was a fave! I'll be back to try something else. Great place for kids and dogs, the patio is gorgeous!"}
{"text":"We have been here several times and sent friends here. The food and service are always excellent. The bar makes great cocktails too.  I'm glad they went back to the original cauliflower recipe; I order it almost every time."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch when I was in town visiting family and had an outstanding brunch.  Cocktails were delicious, food was plated beautifully and tasted even better, and the cold press from the coffee bar was phenomenal.    Blue Corn Cake Pancake - this was thicker than a normal pancake, but not too dense.  Good flavor and texture and even with the syrup, wasn't overly sweet.   Sausage Quiche - The crust was SO flaky and so delicious.  This was the perfect size for breakfast, I was full but not uncomfortable - and managed to feel a bit healthy with the side salad it came iwth.    Breakfast Chimichanga - Flavor was delicious and it was also the prettiest looking breakfast I have seen in a long time."}
{"text":"Ocotillo is a huge complex of different buildings in one space. It's so big and vast I almost walked into the coffee bar instead of the restaurant. The interior is sleek and posh and there were a ton of people eating here for lunch. If you aren't looking to have a lot of conversation this might be your place at lunch because the din from the diners was so loud I feel like I had to nearly shout at my dining buddy Merichelle V. in order to be heard lol.    The menu is an intriguing mix of Mediterranean and Asian influenced foods. We decided to split the falafel burger and the Korean BBQ brisket sandwich to have the best of both worlds. Out of the two I enjoyed the brisket more. It had tender slow cooked fatty beef. Although it was touted as a Korean style meat I didn't really taste anything totally convincing me otherwise. Maybe some kimchi or gochujang would help? Maybe it was marinated in bulgolgi seasoning but the seasoning or preparation wasn't distinct enough to make me think \"Oh this is Korean!\". It was served with some pickled shredded vegetables, lettuce and encased in a lightly toasted bun. The overall flavor was good.  While I appreciate the idea of a falafel burger, I didn't really feel like eating one was a good alternative to just ordering a regular falafel platter with pita. It seemed like it was a burger only for the novelty factor. The patty itself was very thick and had a one dimensional texture and taste, combined with bread that was too thick to go with the falafel. With each bite I felt I was eating a lot of bread and not enough filling.   Sides were a mixed grains salad and fries. The fries tasted like the kind of stuff mass produced and from a freezer bag but were fried so they were lightly crisp. I liked the combination of textures in the salad but it tasted a bit bland to me.  Service was great from Patrick who was good at checking up on us and refilling drinks as needed.   I'd love to come back when it's cooler because the patio looks like a great place to dine and hang out. I'd probably skip for lunch next time though because I like being able to hear all the people I am eating with. ;p  3.5/5"}
{"text":"Place is fancy to hangout, great drinks but food lack basic taste. Ordered smoked beets(over sweet), halloumi cheese(why will you give 2 big piece of cheese), duck confit salad(very salty). Ordered couple of drinks which were great hence 3star. May be will try brunch since it's hugely popular place.. hopefully food will be better."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic time celebrating my birthday here.  The staff was absolutely fabulous- super attentive and nice! Seriously I didn't come into contact with anyone who was less than stellar.  Will need to come back to try more food options as I mainly remember the drinks.  The gin and tonic was perfect!! Thanks for making a special day even more special!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places period. The food, the atmosphere, the people and the entertainment is amazing.   My favorite is the Nutella boba coffee and the roasted cauliflower. I have never ordered anything I don't like and I love how you can see the kitchen from the bar.   The bartender Bud is awesome and always makes sure that everyone is taken care of. He was also our server once and was amazing too.   The environment was perfect for our daughter, she enjoyed playing in Lucy's Lawn. Plus, the lawn is friendly for dogs."}
{"text":"Ocotillo gets checked off my bookmark list, hooray! I am so happy we decided on eating here while we were in central Phoenix. The service, food, ambiance was extraordinarily exceptional and just plain cool.  We arrived for breakfast and ordered the ribeye and eggs, also the iron skillet pan cake. This was more than enough food to share between the both of us. There are several patios to choose from for seating and it's absolutely perfect weather for the next month or so. The waitress was so sweet and made small talk also which was above and beyond since it was Sunday brunch hours and she had other tables to attend to.  Overall, the menu is creative and crafty and we will return soon!"}
{"text":"Fun spot for dinner. The service, when I was there, was pleasant and helpful (blonde waitress with some awesome ink). It was a bit loud, but appropriate because there was a retirement party going on. The cocktail list is pretty baller, creative and interesting. The menu is broad, from salad to small plates to mains. Definitely get the cauliflower appetizer with kale pesto -- it's a luscious, roasted whole head of cauliflower surrounded by a deliciously rich, garlicy pesto grounded with the earthiness of the kale. The chicken meatballs are another great choice, large, fried, and tender with a creamy coconut curry sauce. The gazpacho is less successful -- while the peaches are a nice touch, it could use some acid. Overall, a great place on Central."}
{"text":"My first time eating at Ocotillo with a friend today and I thought it was great. The place was packed for the 11:30-2:30 lunch rush, so if your party is larger than 4 i'd recommend a reservation. The wait wasn't too long for a table, unfortunately it being 107 degrees outside we could not take advantage of the many delightful patio areas available. This place offers new and updated twists on some very common items, and it does it so well!! My friend and I shared several items, all served quickly, all presented well, all stayed hot and all were simply delicious! Our servers were attentive and accommodating. The only downside was that it was soooooo noisy my friend and I were shouting at each other to talk lolol. Maybe if I went there at a quieter time that wouldn't be the case. Regardless, I can' t wait to go back and try the other fare offered! I will be lunching/dining at this place with many a friend in the future! Recommended!"}
{"text":"Food was great. Service really not good at all. Hostess unwelcoming and I'm pretty sure our server didn't know we existed for about 15 minutes... but then continued to provide sub-par service after he noticed we were there. Had to chase him down for our check and my drinks were left empty."}
{"text":"Saw in PHX mag one of best new places so had to try it.  Food was okay but the room we sat in was so loud and the tables so close together it made the dining experience miserable.  All I could hear were the people's conversations on either side. The food was not exceptional in any way to make it worth going back. I had to go to the car to get ear plugs so I could stand sitting in there to finish my meal.  They need to rethink the seating in that main room.  I know they get more money cramming people in there but not from me.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"I've been to Ocotillo twice. The first time was an okay experience. The service was lacking, but the food was great - definitely worth a second chance. On my second trip to Ocotillo a few months later, I came in with high hopes. We were promptly seated for brunch, but it took almost 10 minutes to get menus or place a drink order. The restaurant was busy, but in no way full. When our server did come, she seemed very put-out and was extremely rude to us. So rude, in fact, that we left the restaurant. I don't think I've ever left a restaurant after placing an order. The manager quickly apologized, but we will not be going back."}
{"text":"First of all, this is a BEAUTIFUL location. Both the outdoor patio area and the inside are gorgeous and make you feel like you're in for a treat.  My friend and I made a reservation were seated in the dining room area, which is definitely less boisterous than the bar and outside. It seems like the dining room would be good for a romantic date, but the rest of the place is better for group hangs. I hope to sit there next time I go, more fun!  The food itself was delicious. I had a gin and tonic and it seriously came in a GIGANTIC goblet-like glass. Like, this thing is huge. Not complaining, obviously! Love getting my g and t on.  The pasta dishes are incredible! Definitely generous portions, too, which makes the price worth it.  For dessert we had the bread pudding, which was also gigantic. We couldn't finish it, but it was delicious. I'm nor a bread putting expert, but this was one of the best I've had. It was moist (ha, sorry to those who are phobic about this word) without being soggy.  The service was also good. I didn't have any complaints.  All in all, I would definitely recommend Ocotillo and I would like to return."}
{"text":"The menu is unique and the service was outstanding. We sat outside and it's gorgeous. I had baked pasta with butternut squash and my so had the salad with persimmon and pomegranate. They were so tasty."}
{"text":"My husband and I drove from Gilbert after seeing an article in Phoenix magazine. The hostess barely acknowledged our presence and seated us. The staff was slow and it seems they all had an attitude. We ordered two glasses of wine as well as asking for a tequila reposado.  The waiter never returned with the tequila availability.  We had an appetizer of baby artichokes in an aoli sauce which was quite good.  The asparagus appetizer followed and was bland and not well thought out.  It took over 15 minutes to clear the asparagus plates as well. Dinner entrees followed which were good. Our biggest concern was the staff, numerous servers, waiter hardly there to check on our dining. In closing it was not worth the trip."}
{"text":"So this morning I was craving something sweet like pancakes but without that fat unhealthy feeling afterwards and the blue corn pancakes for the perfect substitution for that! They came with a gave syrup which is sweet but not too sweet, and the pancakes themselves had a natural sweetness to them. I grew up on the Navajo reservation where blue corn mush is a popular dish, and we have our own version of \"Blue corn pancakes\"so this was nostalgic for me. To accompany my pancakes I got a side order of potato pancakes (they do not come with the blue corn pancakes but I recommend ordering a side of these for any breakfast dish that it does not come with) and oh my God where they bomb.com!!! I am a potato freakkkkk.... especially hash brown, and might I say Octillo has perfect potato cakes! They are just the right amount of crispy and they are seasoned perfectly- not too little but not too much salt. I will end this review by saying why I put only four out of five stars which is simply because the service. First I tried to call in so I could order pick up but found out that they did not do pick up over the weekend so I had to go in and order over the bar, which I did not have a problem with. And the bartender was very polite and offered me a glass of water while I waited but my issue was I walked right past the owner on my way to the bar (I only know who he is because I seen his video on here on yelp) and I looked him dead in his face and smiled and he did not smile back at me or greet me. Being that he is the owner that did rub me the wrong way, he probably was just busy and did not realize it and had I not known that he was the owner probably would not have bugged me as much, but because I did know, it bothered me a little. But other than that the place is great! Awesome food and a really nice atmosphere.  *** review update***  I have change my review to five out of five stars because the GM David personally emailed me on Yelp and apologized for not acknowledging me that day and explained to me that he was ill that day and only went into check on something really quick and he welcomed me back anytime so with that said I recant my statement about him not acknowledging me. :)"}
{"text":"The food is amazing here!  We had a larger group, so we started out with a bunch of small plates: octopus, pork belly, wings and hearts of palm.  We were lucky the night we went because they had an off-menu special of paella- which fed 5 of us nicely.  Craft drinks were awesome!  Great experience!"}
{"text":"\"The food is great here!\" \"What did you say?\" \"I said the food is great here.\" \"What?\"  Food is great. Can't hear the person across from you talking it's so flipping loud."}
{"text":"AMAZING outdoor atmosphere..... Stopped in for a quick lunch on the front patio. Ordered the Pecan Wood Smoked Beets (a tasty dish of ricotta cheese, arugula, truffle honey, pistachios, herbs, and olive oil, oh... and did I mention the BEETS? BEAUTIFUL BEETS?!?)  We also ordered a pitcher of Red Sangria. Quite possibly the BEST Sangria I have ever tasted. Large, tasty pitcher.  Definitely returning to Ocotillo for more goodness...."}
{"text":"Dave was friendly  and informative probably one of the best gms in the biz. Great wine recommendation. Ill def be back tomorrow night."}
{"text":"I've been twice. The first time for lunch and I thought it was good, not great.  Two weeks ago, we went for dinner with some out of town friends. Frankly, it was amazing.  - fresh ingredients - attentive service - amazing food Just go there."}
{"text":"Service was phenomenal and food 5 stars.  What a place! Great ambience too. Added to my list of favorites."}
{"text":"Ocotillo is the epitome of a cute brunch place. Great deal on mimosas. Awesome food at a reasonable price. I got the vietnamese sausage with fried egg...so good! Everyone else at the table loved their food."}
{"text":"Service was great.   80 for an appetizer, a cocktail and a glass of wine was too much"}
{"text":"Ocotillo has so many options! The brunch , the beer and oh the Coffee Bar! This place is hidden and it is its own Oasis!!!! LOVE!!!!!! LOVE!!!!!!  The ambiance is perfect for any mood and appetite! This is a gem in every meaning of the word.   The patios are great! Can enjoy dinner, coffee or a drink outside. The wait staff is great and very knowledgeable. You can tell they love there job.   Food choices are creative, inviting and making very hard to choose. Thankfully I went with a group so I got to taste a bunch of goodies.   I ordered the mushroom quiche  with goat cheese and couldn't have been happier. The flavor was perfection.   I'm excited to go there for dinner and try some more options. And the wine list...... Anyone that loves a good wine come back as I will! They have so many to choose from!!!!"}
{"text":"Second time trying it and still not a fan. Food is tasteless, service slow. Ordered the rib eye-how can you screw that up? They did though. Maybe the coffee bar is better? Definitely not a dinner spot. Great atmosphere though."}
{"text":"My favorite new restaurant downtown Phoenix. From the amazing food, craft brew, outdoor lounges & the coffee bar, it's a great hang out. The cauliflower appetizer in spicy pesto sauce & the shaved Brussels sprouts kale salad was enough to convince us to order more. Give this place a try & thank me later"}
{"text":"Ocotillo was fantastic. All of the vegetables were amazing and so flavorful. So much fun eating at this restaurant family style. If you go here make sure to order the carrots, beets, and cauliflower. Those were our favorites.   The second round of food was also very good. We had the chicken wings which were very enjoyable as well as the cheese plate which was fantastic.   The final round of food were the large plates where we had the ribeye, ribs, and duck. The steak was great however the ribs and duck were disappointing. Both of the ribs and the duck were much too over seasoned and the meat couldn't even be tasted because of the over seasoning.   Overall it was a great experience."}
{"text":"Terrible kitchen service and management ruins an otherwise great place .  Came here for lunch . Ordered beets for a starter and salmon entree. Also ordered a glass of wine. Ten minutes later the wine arrives . Two minutes later the salmon . No beets. When the beets arrive 5 minutes later the excuse is oh the starter chef \"must have gotten backed up at least you got food!\" When  I sent the beets back ( what was the point) the manager saw what happened and did not come over. Finally when he came to my table to help clear it I asked if he was the manager and he said yes. Had I not asked he never would have identified himself . I told him about how poor the kitchen service is and  his only comment was \" they are in different places. I took it off your bill.\" With a manager like that now I appreciate the comment \" at least you got food.\""}
{"text":"Let me start with saying that the start of our service was not great. We waited 15 minutes after being seated without any drinks or so much as a hello from a server. I decided to go ask the hostess if she could please send a server to our table. We waited another 5 minutes and still no one showed up. I then asked again (politely) to please send someone to our table, the hostess said she'd go get our server right away. He came shortly after and apologized for the delay. That being said, most of our food was delicious! The roasted  cauliflower with kale pesto is amazing! A must have in my opinion. The falafel burger is tasty too, the big slice of beet gives is such a great earthy flavor. Another must have is the tofu ban mi. The flavors on that sandwich are incredible. That sandwich is only on the lunch menu though, not dinner. Despite the service in the beginning, I will be returning. The food was overall tasty! I will add that our server comped our drinks and one of our desserts as an apology. He was great through out the rest of our time there and was very apologetic."}
{"text":"This place is very cool!  Love the outdoor atmosphere altho' I was there on the last day of June and couldn't enjoy the outside.  Inside is very stark (but in a good way).  The one negative I noticed immediately was the noise level which is LOUD!!!  Sitting at the table it was almost impossible to hear others even though we were practically shouting at each other in an attempt to be heard.  So the food....I ordered the Japanese Fish and Chips.  The only thing Japanese about this dish is the fish is breaded with panko bread crumbs and fried for a long time--hence, it was extremely dry.  The \"chips\" were regular French fries.  There was a small cucumber salad that was Asian of sorts, but I noticed that others had the same salad on their plates even tho they hadn't ordered the \"Japanese\" Fish and Chips.  So I can't say that the salad even made it more Japanese.  I wouldn't order this dish again, but would try something else.  Other's meals looked good--meatballs, beef brisket sandwich, salads and more.   One lady ordered the falafel sandwich which was HUGE!  She only ate about a fourth of it.  It did not, in my opinion, look very good, but I'm not a fan of falafel either.  When the weather cools off, I would love to go back and sit outside and have a nice glass of iced coffee or tea.  I plan on doing just that!"}
{"text":"I've been here once and I plan to come back. The food selection is excellent, I really liked the baked pasta I ordered with the goat cheese. I forget the name but it's in the picture below.   I also enjoyed the small plate Pork. It was almost like a deconstructed Vietnamese spring roll. Excellent taste, texture and depth.   The facility is amazing, very large and can be used as event venue or a brunch time chill spot out on the patio.  The dining room was pretty rough however. It seemed like it was super loud; I was sitting closer to the guy next to me than my girlfriend across the table. I can hear everyone conversation like I'm sitting in a cafeteria in grade school. I dunno, kinda bummed about that aspect.   It was very cold the night I was there so maybe once the temp is nice out they won't pack so many in the cafeteria.   I'll be back from brunch!"}
{"text":"Okay, it's unusually these days to be WOW'ed by a restaurant, but I can honestly say that Ocotillo WOW'ed me. So spacious. There's dining, lounging, and bar stooling available. If you sit near the bar (by the way it's a good sized bar and roomy so no one is brushing past saying \"oh sorry\"), you can watch the folks in the kitchen busily preparing the dishes.   Creative dishes is an understatement, unbelievable flavors, and the food really hit the spot. I'm almost afraid to go back because if the cooks are different the food may not taste the same and I would be left like a junkie trying to chase that first high.  My mistake was ordering take out, but it was a weeknight and I was tired. The least favorite was the Crispy Falafel Burger - $14.00 Between the thick bun is a very thick falafel patty with baba ghanoush, pickled green tomatoes, lettuce, mint, yogurt and feta. First of all, why is 'crispy' in the description? Who serves soggy falafel?   I requested no yogurt and no feta. I think the mint was left out too because I couldn't taste any. The baba g. was great and the next time I will ask for extra. It was the only thing I liked on the burger. The pickled tomatoes were just way to thick for me. Maybe if they were sliced thinner I would have eaten them because the burger needed something juicy. I also threw out the grossly wilted lettuce because it was awful by the time I got home. (Now you see why take out was a mistake.)   The side of fries were cut thick with skin on (yum!) and heavily seasoned with salt. They were also sprinkled with parsley I think but it must have been dried parsley flakes because the flavor was completely tasteless and useless to the meal. All I got was saltiness, but since they were so nicely cooked I ate about half.  Coming in third place were the Roasted Sweet Potatoes - $9.00 There were white potato slices mixed in (why?) and also sweet potato chips (why?) with grilled fennel, labneh, harissa, cilantro, and sesame seeds. You're probably asking 'why not?' but honestly I think the dish should have only featured SWEET potatoes. Why didn't the cooks use sweet white potatoes? Doesn't that make more sense than a regular white potato? Duh!   Anyway, I ordered sans cheese and really got to taste that harissa. I'm pretty sure I've never had harissa before. It was delicious, especially with the black and white sesame seeds. It tasted sort of like chili. And then there was the cilantro. Yum! Just enough added to perk up the overall beauty of the complete ensemble. If it wasn't for the plain white potato and chips this would have been my second fave.  In second place was the Gazpacho - $11.00 Served cold of course with heirloom tomatoes, peaches, homemade croutons, pickled chilies, and herbs. It was a tiny portion - seriously I felt robbed, call the cops! - for the price (maybe that was due to the take out order) but it was surprisingly delicious. At first I was worried that the veggies were too oily but once I combined them with the soup everything blended very well.  First place goes to the Chinese Long Beans - $9.00 I've seen long beans in the grocery store and never bought them because I couldn't picture myself eating beans that size, but this rocked! Just about the only cheese I want, the romesco sauce was a bright orange and even though it was smooth you could see all the almond, parsley, and parmesan morsels in it. I will ask for extra of this next time. Wow! So delicious. Plus the beans were tender, not stringly like I originally thought they would be.  I definitely plan to return to Ocotillo with a crew so we can lounge outside and eat the food while it's hot. The dishes were fantastic and I was happy to see multiple vegetarian choices. I think the falafel and sweet potato dishes were vegan without the cheese, but you can never be sure about baba ghanoush because some annoying cooks slip yogurt in it so definitely ask the waiter when you go.   The total with tax was $47 and worth my pretty pennies."}
{"text":"My experience here started off okay, we arrived at about 5pm it was my first time. I didn't know you needed reservations so they only had two tables available (although 6 stayed empty through our whole meal). If you go do the grilled vegetables...cauliflower and brocolli they are amazing best you will have. I was so excited about my entree but it was downhill from there...the pasta is homemade but just not good I could say a whole lot but both dishes we ordered none of the three of us at the table liked. I ordered the chicken. I took one bite the flavor was great, second bite I saw pink flesh so that ended that. Our waitress took a while to check on us so we sat chatting hungry still. She sent the manager over, he seemed offended or uninterested or something but he offered nothing...we didn't want to try again. To not give up we ordered dessert...chocolate cake in pie crust and the creme dessert with pound cake bites, the chocolate cake is amazing, the other not so much. I actually probably would have gave it 3 stars but the manager sucked, the other manager went around checking on tables asking how everyone was doing and skipped ours. Our waitress was ok..."}
{"text":"This was our first time here after driving by their billboard for several months. This really was one of the places you have to experience instead of reading reviews - ironic, I know.  We started with a couple of expertly crafted cocktails: Bumble Bee for my date and I ordered a Boulevardier myself. We started with a Tomato Tartine with these beautiful squash blossoms and a nice light, whipped  lemon ricotta. Our entrees were carefully selected because literally everything on the menu had me salivating and I could've starved to death if I hadn't just picked something, ANYTHING. Our server brought us the Beef ribs - a rewarding 4 bone, molé bbq dripping, charred serving of meaty goodness and the Radiotore shrimp pasta dish in a beautiful white whine sauce. I was satiated after the tartine but the lure of the server running the dishes by our table was way too enticing. So we indulged and indulged some more with a bottle of wine and the most decadent chocolate cake with fresh whipped cream cream and juicy seasonal black cherries. I could've licked my plates. As if the pristine food and the knowledgeable and warm staff couldn't have elevated this experience any more I was very pleased to make a new friend with my visit to the washroom; the hospitality was extended by the house cat, a precocious white and black kitty with Frida-esque \"eyebrows\" making sure everyone washes their hands. The staff rescued the little feline from a shelter and she's been working on site policing the property ever since.  At first I thought it was too bright and kind of noisy but later just came to terms with it because they obviously wanted you to get the full visual of the presentation of their food and everyone was buzzing about their experience. I can't wait to go back. I have 2 more menus to order from once i've tried everything on the dinner menu. Thanks Nicole and the back of the house for this refreshing culinary experience. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because it has to be too good to be true."}
{"text":"Octotillo is a definition of superb southwest dining. Interior and exterior was amazing, it was like breath of fresh air and aesthetically pleasing to the eyes. Service was superb our waiter was very attentive and food was amazing! I invited a couple of friends to brunch, and we wanted bottomless mimosas which they don't advertise but it is actually a thing on Saturdays and Sunday's for 18 dollars which is awesome. What I ordered was something sweet and it was the iron cast skillet pancake which composed of warm fruit compote, powdered sugar and maple syrup! Friends ordered from the light menu and sweet, also savory which they all thought was amazing. I definitely have a love for over easy eggs and hash browns which were amazing! Other than that no complains but if you're a coffee person they also have another part of the restaurant which includes a coffee bar also outdoor yard patio which is amazing with the view and sometimes good weather when we have it in Phoenix. Looking for a new dining in experience stop by! And stay hungry Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Is Ocotillo cheap? No. Is it well worth it and one of the best restaurants in Phoenix? Yes. It's been awhile since I've come away from a meal with a more content feeling. The atmosphere itself makes Ocotillo a great visit -- a bar, coffee shop and full service restaurant all share the space and create a lively scene. However, the food is the true star of the show. I experienced flavors that I've honestly never tasted before ... and I've eaten my fair share of food. Every menu item was creatively designed and presented like a piece of artwork. My \"must try\" items would be the Ocotillo Chicken, Curried Cauliflower and Spicy Tofu Salad. Although, I'll admit I'm partial to any item that relatively resembles a healthy dish and still manages to taste incredible (that's much more impressive to me than taking a bunch of junk food and making it tasty). If you go, two tips for you: try to make a reservation and prepare for much larger portion sizes than you would expect for a fancier restaurant. Now, what are you waiting for? Get yourself to Ocotillo."}
{"text":"LOVE the vibe and service. I had the eggplant and enjoyed every bite. Its an original culinary experience that does not disappoint."}
{"text":"Just tasted the new menu! Grilled Octopus is amazing and I don't typically enjoy octopus. Chase your winter blues away Roasted root vegetables, arugula, fine cheeses, thinly sliced citrus, with roasted nuts, hinted with vinaigrette. Ocotillo highlights winter tubers with a glimpse of spring. Brilliantly delicious cuisine!"}
{"text":"I have visited Ocotillo a handful of times and I am so in love with it. The space is large, open, and inviting; it really has a delightful atmosphere. Whenever I go to Ocotillo I am excited to try something new because the menu is unique and the food delivers on flavor and freshness. I highly recommend the carrot top pesto and fresh mozzarella - outstanding! The balsamic strawberries and ricotta are also incredible. The ricotta was so creamy and the richness was cut by the acidic, sweet, and savory balsamic strawberries! MMMM...!"}
{"text":"Incredible date night spot. Upscale and clean, polished ambiance with cool tunes / fireplace and picnic table patio. Server Eli was knowledgable about everything, even the wine. He was pumped to be our server and that made for such a genuine and comfortable experience. We loved the pork steak, espresso mole beef ribs, and clam pasta with home made noodles. Very impressed ocotillo, thanks for an amazing dinner"}
{"text":"Hit up Ocotillo for brunch last week and it was awesome--from the service to the food.  Our waiter was exceptional (Taylor?) with the exact amount of attention and care.  We truly appreciated his service.   Thank you,"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Nicole the server may have social issues, as when we asked her one question about a drink she snapped, so odd as people working in the customer service field should have skills that are receptive to working with people! We decided not to order food as we felt a very negative vibe and decided to leave. The worst experience so far in Arizona. All the other restaurants and service have been phenomenal. I hope the manager has a discussion with her as they lost out on a good $100 or more as we order lots of food n drinks normally!  Changed to 3 stars, as the manager did reach out to me & apologized for his rude & unprofessional staff member. I did appreciate that, didn't try the food, so can't rate that but the drinks were good.  & of course we didn't have time nor would we think of something so dumb as to complain, while at the restaurant to call over a manager to make it more awkward, then it was, so that's out of the picture for any idiot who's dumb enough to wonder why I would leave a review and not just ask for a manager. I would never complain about someone and then order food in the same breath, who knows what someone is capable of doing to my food etc., so yes think logically before u comment--"}
{"text":"Easy parking, stylish decor, very relaxed but classy feel, outstanding service and best of all, awesome food! All at a very reasonable price - you get true value for money here and it would be an excellent venue to bring a date or business associate to 'make the right impression'."}
{"text":"New spot in my neighborhood! Excellent food, very foodie! My girlfriend and I met up for brunch a few weeks ago and had a great time here. They are very foodie though, I didn't understand half the menu lol but it all tasted awesome! They plan pretty loud music for brunch, was my only complaint. They had a DJ so it was good music at least.   They also have a dog friendly patio and a little grass area the kids can play on. Next trip I plan is to take a walk up there and try their coffee bar."}
{"text":"We go here often! The owner is always talking to customers to be sure the experience is good. And for us, it never has disappointed!  They offer a great unique menu, have a fantastic wine selection, and service is always spot on."}
{"text":"The only reason I was able to give Ocotillo two stars is because the food and drinks are delicious.   Let's jump right into the reason for the poor rating, my boyfriend found a piece of GLASS the size of a pea in his cocktail.   Following finding the piece of glass in his cocktail, I immediately got up and went straight to the bar. I explained to the bartender how scary this is and if he would've swallowed it he could've died. I mean, it was a chunk of GLASS! She offered him a free drink and no apology...um what....  I told her I'd like to speak to the manager. She didn't realize I was following her as she went to find her manager. My shoes were a bit tall so I was about 15-30 seconds behind her. When I walked up, she was mocking me and doing a full on impression of me verbatim of what I said directly to her manager. I've never felt so disrespected. I don't feel like I was out of line for calling out a giant piece of glass in a drink. As she was talking smack about me, I kindly interjected, \"I'm standing right behind you.\" She looked mortified. At this point she stormed off.   The manager agreed with me this was a big deal and took care of our tab. Mind you, I would've been more than happy to pay my tab if my boyfriend wouldn't have almost swallowed a piece of glass. I've been to this restaurant many times, have never complained and had a wonderful experience.  It gets worse though! I went back to my table, which was a group of 13 and also positioned right next to the bar this girl is working at. She CONTINUES TO TALK SMACK about me and my friends. Not just for a few minutes for the next hour that we were there. She was literally talking about me to the patrons sitting at the bar. I would've left but it was one of my best friend's birthday dinner and I wouldn't dip on her due to this mean girl making me feel uncomfortable.   I've never had a waiter/waitress/bartender make me feel uncomfortable and threatened until now.  To really put a cherry on top, when our party was leaving she sardonically screeched \"Have a nice night!\" If anyone else would've said it, I know it wouldn't have been rude. I knew she was just trying to get one last dig before we left.   I really don't understand what I did to her to deserve her going out of her way to be mean to me and my friends. We're actually nice people who just wanted to have a good time.   I've been telling everyone Ocotillo is the best new restaurant in Phoenix. This is the entire reason our party chose Ocotillo for my friend's birthday dinner. The food is fantastic and the drinks are even better. Sadly, after being disrespected and feeling threatened by this girl I do not think I will be returning anytime soon nor recommending it to anyone unless they want to be heckled by a rude bartender."}
{"text":"Great outdoor open air space.  Food was great.  The service was slow and forgetful.  We'll come back."}
{"text":"Went for Brunch on a busy Sunday afternoon and sat at the bar. Ordered a couple drinks and a couple entrees. The brisket was very good and filling, but my partner's fried mozzarella sandwich was not exciting. The bartender on staff was very nice and attentive, and she made a good Bloody Mary, but the rest of the experience was obnoxious. The staff seemed too interested in their cell phones and friends than attending to customers. This restaurant is very nice looking and the food is promising, but the service needs refinement."}
{"text":"What a wonderful dining experience. We have eaten there twice and both times it was wonderful.  Just a word of warning though, if you are going to have a full dinner, that doesn't start until 5:30.  Food preparation was awesome. Very different combinations. Their chicken and the steak was great. The ribs were huge and very meaty. Portion size was generous. Drinks were well made as well. The wait staff was very attentive and did a great job. You can eat inside, outside, or at a community table. The setting was great and there was plenty of parking. I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I'm guessing you guys probably get bored with all of the good reviews but here is another. Our brunch was simply amazing! We had the polenta crusted eggplant which was a marriage of everything awesome. We also shared the pineapple upside down pancake which was more like a thin fluffy cake. I appreciate the basil topping it and that it isn't super sweet. Aside from the awesome food the entire space is relaxing and beautiful. Thanks for a great brunch!"}
{"text":"Good one...great design...solid food program.  Service could use some focus...hipsters being hipsters...you are in a hospitality \"job\".  Please have some respect for the \"service\" industry young ones!   Owners / Mangers- need to drill deep on service or Ocotillos will be ococlosos.     Falafelburger is huge!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Food was delicious, the property is beautiful. I took off one star because of the wait time for food. Came here for lunch both times and food takes 30-40 mins to come out. This is too long of a wait for lunch especially if you are working and only have an hour lunch."}
{"text":"Perfect date spot. We sat outside on the north patio. The lighting was perfect. The location is beautiful. The service was awesome. And the Peruvian Salmon Ceviche was one of the best meals I've ever tasted. So excited to try out Ocotillo's brunch. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Visited this place for my husbands birthday. loved the vibe and feel of the restaurant.  I had two drinks, one which was amazing Blood and Sand I believe. We had the cauliflower for an appetizer and we both got a chicken dish. Food and service were great! The only thing that sucked was that my card was charged for the total bill plus the portion I split with my other guests. it took 4 days for the hold to release. I was annoyed because I wasn't told there would be a processing error like that. I'll still go back but only when I have cash."}
{"text":"The employees seemed a little cold, which instantly turned me off. But the nutella coffee and boba teas were bomb. My husband and I would've stayed if it wasn't for the terrible service."}
{"text":"I love this place, I eat at  Ocotillo about twice per month. Their brunch is fantastic as is their lunch and dinner menu. Perfect for a date or with a group. Seriously I can't say enough good things about this fabulous restaurant. Food is stellar, meat and vegetarian options, and drinks are really top-notch. The staff and the owner always make you feel at home."}
{"text":"I just don't know what I'm going to eat at Ocotillo! The menu is awesome. There is really something for everyone. House made pasta! Beef ribs and a great selection of summer veggies. I seriously come here to eat so much the friendly staff like May the bartender knows my favorite drink. Great place!"}
{"text":"Today I learned what polenta is. I also learned that it's delicious! Or at least the way it was prepared. Rich and dare I say decadent. The atmosphere, music, and bathroom all tie together perfectly too. There's even a restaurant cat that meanders through the patio. If you approach slowly, he might let you pet him for 3 seconds before scampering off.   I'm not too crazy about the menu layout - a bit confusing. But that could just be me."}
{"text":"Ocotillo is one of my favorite newer spots. Most things I have had were totally delicious, unique and well crafted....though I personally recommend skipping the smoked beet salad. It was very, very smokey (ie not edible and verified by my dinner guest, we both found it inedible). I clearly didn't eat it but the server didn't seem to be bothered to ask much or see if something was wrong or if I wanted something else- just asked if I wanted a to go box. I told her it was way too smokey to eat and that was that. I am not one to send things back but I was still slightly disappointed by the lack of observation/concern on the behalf of the waitress.   Truly though, the food is great and had that one instance not occurred, they would be 5 star all the way for me. I also acknowledge I shouldn't be disappointed when not voicing to send it back specifically... I just find that to be painfully awkward so waitresses that are attentive to their customers are superstars in my book. Their Applejack/Cava cocktail is worth skipping dinner all together and ordering another if the budget is tight.... but that's just my style ;)"}
{"text":"My friend and I came in on a busy Sunday brunch - despite not finding a seat at the bar, Oscar made sure we were taken care of and came around the bar to make sure we were served in a timely manner. On Oscar's recommendation, we thoroughly enjoyed the cauliflower (HUGE but amazing) and the crab pasta (I still have dreams about it, wishing it wasn't gone). Can't wait to come back :)!"}
{"text":"Visited Ocotillo for lunch today.  Parking was a little difficult and very dusty - ended up parking in a dusty dirt lot down the street.  The buildings that make up the restaurant are inviting and interesting.  Service was great.  Food was terrible.  Ordered the brisket sandwich.  No brisket to be found in a sloppy mess of HUGE strings of onions and lackluster \"slaw\".  Pieces of what they considered brisket were pure fat with some BBQ sauce.  Came with a side of lackluster fries.  Only thing worth consuming was the minty lemonade.  My friend ordered the salmon sandwich which was also a huge mess and hard to eat.  Most of it ended up in a soggy pile on his plate.  Might come back to visit the coffee bar but only if I'm in the area.  Ocotillo is obviously using its aesthetic and location rather than food quality to lure customers.  Bummer!"}
{"text":"Fab \"new\" spot located in Central Phoenix. It does a great job of delivering delicious New American food and providing an open and industrial/modern space. The spot contains a restaurant, cafe and tons of open space like a beer garden, bar and patio.  For the restaurant (menu wise), they serve lunch and dinner. However, they only serve brunch on the weekends.   I came here for lunch with Stacy M to get a little taste of what Ocotillo had to offer and was pleasantly surprised. We ordered their Iced Coffee Boba, filled Dates, Cabbage Salad and a Egg White Breakfast Burrito to share and it was more than enough.  Iced Coffee Boba: I would pass on this as the coffee tastes like any typical iced coffee you can get, however the boba was overly done and mushy instead of having the chewy, bouncy texture it should have. Dates: dates filled with ricotta and topped with almonds and blackberries, this appetizer is deliciously simple and perfect for sharing. No judgement if you don't want to, it's perfectly acceptable because they are that good! Cabbage Salad: this salad is fresh, light and comes is a more than generous portion. It has shaved cabbage, carrot and comes with a lovely tea dressing that adds a tart and fragrant flavor to the salad. The Egg white burrito: was probably the best egg white anything I've ever had, it was so flavorful and clean. This entree surprised me the most. Filling, clean tasting but nothing short of flavorful from the ingredients and house salsa that's served with it.  The cafe is the only cafe in Phoenix that serves Sightglass coffee and has a good arrangement of drinks, snacks and pastries. Although separate from the rest of the restaurant, this area is quiet and perfect for solo coffee/tea drinkers. I've had their Autumn Latte, breakfast burrito (egg and bacon) as well as their Nutella Croissant and it was all so delicious. They definitely take typically made items and add their own twist which is truly refreshing. The price is also a lot cheaper than most other cafes I frequent, which is a definite plus!  The staff here can be a bit slow, but they are all so friendly and easy to talk to. They truly make you feel welcomed and show their appreciation. They are also really receptive to any questions or concerns you may have. Definitely a place to check out!"}
{"text":"Although my first visit has been on a cold rainy day I was amazed at how beautiful the patios are and could imagine it to be a real plus in this Phoenix environment. It was like a little urban oasis. The menu was delightful refreshing and healthy. Everything is beautifully presented  and I was truly impressed. I had met a girlfriend there for lunch and the only problem we had is that it is so busy and very very noisy. I had seen this as a problem and some of the other reviews and apparently a lot of it is due to the concrete flooring in the restaurant. Since I hadn't seen my girlfriend in quite a long time and we wanted to talk we thought maybe this was not the place for us and discussed this with our weight person Jamie. Jamie asked us to just wait a minute and she will talk with her manager who was so very nice and finding us a very quiet booth in the back of the restaurant so that we could girl chat.I was really impressed with this cause it was a very very busy lunchtime. Manager did share with me that they would be putting carpeting down because they realize that this was a problem. I think it will solve some of the noisiness.Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"We attempted to have brunch here this past Sunday 4/30/17 with a small group of friends. We were a party of 5 and we did not have a reservation. We arrived at around 10:30, well before the busy brunch scene. We were greated by 2 young, condescending, and rude hostesses. Who told us that every table in the restaurant was either occupied or reserved. The restaurant was half empty at this point. We didn't make a big deal of this seemingly improbable statement. We simply asked what were our options. We were told we could order from the full menu at the coffee shop area or the bar. Quite dismissively I must say. With no explanation as to where any of these areas were located. We wondered around the property which is pretty large and sprawling with every staff encounter just as rude as the first. Finally were told by 1 wait person that he would help us but we had to sit in area of couches that had zero shade from the already blazing Phoenix sun. Keep in mind we passed numerous empty tables. We simply got tired of being treated like dirt and decided to take our business elsewhere.  It's a beautiful restaurant with seemingly good food, but the staff has no idea what hospitality service is. I couldn't leave without at least speaking my mind to the hostess. I simply had to tell her that she was quite rude and perhaps needed to reevaluate the way she speaks to guests of the restaurant. I was very polite even though she deserved a bit more direct speech. She didn't even try to offer an apology of any kind. Could not care less.   If you are an owner or manager of this restaurant and read this. Perhaps you should look at who you place at the door of your establishment. I wouldnt want the 2 who greated us on Sunday to be my representative."}
{"text":"Okay, so let me preface this by saying this was the first time I have been to Ocotillo. However, that being said, I have to say, this is a very nice place. I am sitting here with eight other people, including my husband. Our friends are in here from out of town, and we wanted to take them to a really nice and unique restaurant; and this definitely fits the bill. The food was incredible; and plentiful!! If you order from the Large Plates section...come with an appetite. They don't mess around with their large plate portions. They are perfect for sharing. I had the salmon and my husband had the ribeye; both fantastic!  For appetizer, we had this ricotta spread, with balsamic glaze and a sun-dried strawberries. Got to spread that on some toasted crostini; was so flavorful and a perfect way to start the dinner. We had a nice gentleman stop by our table shortly after we got there; making sure we were doing well. It wasn't until he came to our side of the table, that we realized he must have been the owner/manager. He helped us with our wine selection, and found us a great bottle of Chardonnay to go along with our meals. Dress code is \"casual\", technically...but all of us were in polos and nice jeans; and that seemed to be what other guests were wearing. So, business casual seemed more of an appropriate way to classify the dress code. We had a choice of inside and outside; and we chose outside. The evening cooled off quite a bit, but they had plenty of heaters to take off the chill. Where we were seated was perfect; quiet enough to hear and keep up with conversation...but still amongst other couples/diners. Plus...dining al fresco with your closest friends on a beautiful night...can't beat that! All in all, we highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I have to give Ocotillo 5 stars because they have so much to offer. Too hot, sit inside, the inside is awesome, cooler weather they have the best for outside seating, socializing and relaxing. I just love the feel of this place. I haven't tried many dishes of food, but what I did try was amazing. The ribs melted off the bone. I tried carrot fattoush and wow, what a great salad, so full of flavor and to top it off it is healthy! I love the ambiance of this place. A quaint little coffee bar to an outside beer garden to an inside restaurant with food to die for! Fun place and a must check out if you have never been."}
{"text":"Delicious great atmosphere inside and out. Lots of options, large portions, everything uniquely different and full of flavor!!!! We will be back. Service was excellent too!   I came back and brought a few friends and ordered many different selections on the menu to critique them all and I will say they are point on with these recipes and flavors. The Chef knows what he/she is doing. Happy Happy:) My only suggestion would to add an acoustic guitar player for some entertainment the outside patio areas are inviting and would love to be able to relax and hang out.  My original 4 stars is now 5"}
{"text":"Good ambience, duck confit salad was good but lemonade was too sugary. I would come back the next time I visit this area."}
{"text":"The atmosphere, outside, is a 5 star. The patio on a warm spring night is very inviting. The inner courtyard looked beautiful, like somewhere you would want to have a special event, but was mostly closed off due to a couple of corporate events.  The food? That's the thwo star rating. A friend and I went and were very excited to finally be finding the time (and a reservation) that worked. Our server, don't remember her name, was very friendly and mostly knowledgable about what was on the menu and drinks menu. We chose to stick to the veggies and salad with the market fish- salmon as our entree. The food came out, beautifully presented, but there was no pacing and it was rather unceremoniously plopped on the table, often leaving us to scramble to make room. The young man who was running food seemed to have no sense of courtesy. We had the spring vegetable fattoush. It was a beautiful salad but really did not have a lot of flavor. The cauliflower is flash fried, then roasted and was better than the fattoush. It was served with a kale pesto and peanuts. We also tried the baby artichoke tartine. This was a play on a tartine and was really just a fancy way of presenting bruschetta, albeit on a large slice of bread. Flavor? Ok, but not memorable.  Now, the market fresh fish. We ordered salmon. We were presented with a flat white fish that was overcooked. We finally caught someone's attention to ask where the salmon was? Our server didn't know. She got a man, large with large glasses, and we were rather off-puttingly told it was turbot. Apparently the corporate events consumed the salmon. We ran out of salmon, deal with it  was sort of the attitude.  We also tried the \"ricotta filled\" pound cake with fresh berries, lemon curd and marshmallow. I'm guessing the \"filled\" referred to ricotta was an ingredient in the cake and the marshmallow? More like meringue but that could be splitting hairs at this point. The cake was dry, we didn't eat but a few bites and there was no inquiry in to if anything was wrong.  I know this was one of Phoenix's top 10 new restaurants for 2016-17. I love the concept, love the setting, but the food- which is what I'm there for- just wasn't all that."}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars.  Came here based on a recommendation for brunch. The architecture is really cool and the service was spot on.  Decided to order the steak, eggs, and hash browns.  Everything was good, but it didn't quite reach the great category - had asked for eggs over easy and they came out over medium, steak was warm when served and not cooked evenly throughout, hash brown patty had good texture but not a lot of seasoning.  Would certainly come back again and try some of their other brunch items."}
{"text":"I went to Ocotillo on a beautiful Saturday brunch with a girlfriend and out two 6 year old boys after visiting the children's museum.   The atmosphere was wonderful on the outside portion of the establishment. Visually satisfying with a beautiful grass area that was perfect for the kids to escape and it be acceptable.   We ordered a blue corn skillet pancake, avocado toast, roasted Cauliflower with Aleppo pepper, smoked brisket with polenta and a fried egg. All were beautifully prepared, amazing flavor and exceed my expectations. My Compliments to chef, very talented.  All items were respectfully appropriate to pricing.    MacAllister was our server, very knowledgable of the menu. He suggested basically everything we ordered and included kid friendly options for not having a kids menu, which was so thoughtful. He was very attentive to our needs and had the BEST personality. That made the entire experience a 5 star and beyond.   I will definitely recommend this establishment with high regard, I look forward to the next time and will specifically request the service of MacAllister.     Update: on a date we sat at the chefs table and got to watch the kitchen while we ate some amazing new menu items. Pictures posted."}
{"text":"I usually have a great experience here, but I was incredibly disappointed with our service from tonight. I gushed about this place to my party of 12 for dinner, and was completely embarrassed by the end. The waiter was confused about who got what drink and what food, for which made the paying process to exceed 30 minutes. Word of advice, if you are going to serve a large party, always ask if this will be on one or separate checks right in the beginning. We will still be coming back, but not necessarily with a large group in the future!"}
{"text":"Hair in my food. Continue reading for the full story... When we first pulled up to this place we thought it was closed down because of the way the outside looked. It looks like a rusty, run down metal shack with dried/dead weeds all over the lawn. Ew Once we parked and got out we could see it was open and was trying to look trendy and hip. It had kind of a weird set up. There were four separate buildings that encircled a courtyard. It's was interesting.  The decor and food seemed very very \"hipster\" like. Not bad, but a little strange for us. Was still nice. The windows at the top of the building didn't have shades that could be pulled down to block the sun, and it was annoying to have the sun in my eyes the whole time I was eating.  I had a salmon blt type sandwich and my husband had the pork steak. Food tastes great and the seasoned fries were delicious..... But this is where this review goes downhill... I picked up a French fry, about to eat it, when suddenly something caught my eye. I looked closer and saw there was a black hair sitting on my fry, sort of underneath the seasoning. I looked closer to make sure and even had my husband look closely at it. Sure even, it was a shiny 1 1/2\" long black hair. Immediately grossed out, I stopped eating and pushed my food away. I had only eaten half of my sandwich and fries. When the waitress came over, we told her about the hair and I pointed to it on the fry. Her response was something like \"oh...\" And when I said I was done she said \"ok cool\".  Um, there was a human hair on my food and that was the response? She picked up our plates and immediately went and got our bill and deposited it on the table. There was no mention of comping us for my food at all.  I was really irritated by that. We asked to speak to the manager, and she got a little flustered so we just explained that it wasn't cool to charge us for the food when there was a hair on it. She quickly explained that she was going to take care of it and that we weren't going to be charged. That would've been nice to hear right from the get go.  Now this is what made me furious. We were chatting with her and she said \"I don't wanna down play it at all, you know, but it looked more like just a fuzzy than a hair..\" WHAT?! I'm sorry, but she never asked to see it closely to see what we were seeing. If she couldn't see it, she should have said so, so that I could have shown her closer! My husband and I both examined it very thoroughly and we KNOW it was a BLACK HAIR! She could sense I was about to lose it and got the manager for us.  When the manager came over, he said that he was told that I found a fuzz on my food. OMFG!!! We immediately corrected him and told him we saw very clearly that it was a black hair! He apologized profusely and also apologized for how the waitress handled things. I sincerely believed him when he said things like that don't happen and that it was abnormal, so I don't want people reading this thinking that they shouldn't try this place at all. I'm mostly mad about the way it was handled. It was like I was being patted on the head while being told \"oh I'm sure it wasn't REALLY a hair...\"   I appreciate the way the manager handled things. I really hope they ensure people in the back are wearing hairnets. I took one star away for the way the outside looked, it just looked so nasty with the rusted metal.  We might try this place again for brunch, and possibly improve this review. I would give it another try in the future."}
{"text":"Each time I go there, food is good. My salad was 14 bucks and that didn't even include chicken. The issue are the fits and flying bugs. They are everywhere and awful. So disgusting."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch during the week and had a decent size crowd for 11:30am. There seem to be 2 hostess stands which doesn't make sense upon entering and the no one is willing to help you out unless specifically asked. The service was bad from the start. The hostess acting confused about why you're there (showing up to a restaurant and wanting to sit down to eat apparently is a be concept) and the server came by after 10 mins of sitting, then when we wanted to order he said he wanted to get waters first and will be back. Seriously another 10 minutes passed before he came by again.  Well if you've looked at the menu you will likely have a couple questions or want to hear a recommendation but I didn't have 30 minuets of just sitting without placing a food order. So took a shot and went safe with sandwiches. We ordered the brisket sandwich (absolutely delicious - a little skimpy on the brisket but I liked it a lot) and ordered the chicken tonto sandwich - which was just added to the menu a couple weeks ago. The chicken sandwich was not good and all I could taste was smashed up black beans. Absolutely no hint to taste the guac or chicken. I opened up the sandwich and just ate the chicken directly and tossed the rest. Don't expect much chicken either - prob totaled the amount of 1 chicken nugget.  I would be open to trying this place for brunch if I had no other plans the rest of the day - but no way I'd go back for lunch. You would have to clear your calendar since the service is so awful. If it wasn't for liking the brisket sandwich, I would be completely out on this place. PS - it's extremely loud in here so not a good place for business meetings."}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  Ocotillo is excellent.  We've come for lunch and dinner and have been surprised at the consistent quality of the food.  For lunch we've ordered the house country pate (large portion, pretty good but nothing spectacular), roasted cauliflower, Peruvian chicken, and the mesquite grilled salmon (also average, but not bad at all.)  The cauliflower may be one of the single best dishes they serve.  Perfectly cooked, with some acidity and crunch on the side, it is fantastic.  The Peruvian chicken we had was also most and delicious.  Props to them for getting the aji amarillo right, comparing well to the best Peruvian we've had in LA and NYC.  Also came for dinner with some out-of-town guests.  We again ordered the cauliflower, and we ordered the beets (quite good, nothing to rave about, but good), grilled romano beans (perhaps the weakest dish we ordered but eh fiddleheads on the side were a GREAT touch), and the asparagus (well cooked, a little bite left, decently seasoned).  The three pastas we ordered were (in order of deliciousness):  casarecce, radiatore, and tagliatelle.  The Calabrian peppers added a nice kick to the heavy pork belly in the casarecce, which were al dente.  The radiotore was good, soft al dente, well-balanced and lighter than the other two.  The tagilatelle was over-cooked the flavors did not meld all that well on the plate.  The atmosphere here is great and with the above-average food, is worth visiting regularly.  Oddly I'll end on a negative.  The I am NOT a fan of the beer selection in the beer garden.  The area itself is great, but the selection is pretty poor and doe snot live up tot he beautiful surrounds."}
{"text":"Love it!! Go there now then hit their new place Starlite BBQ on Indian School and Miller Rd.  Both outstanding!"}
{"text":"We heard about Ocotillo from the 2016 Best New Restaurants in Phoenix Magazine and wanted to try it out for our anniversary weekend. The ambiance is great with the wood burning fire pits as you walk in from the back parking lot. We asked to be seated outside as it was less noisy on the patio. Our waitperson was very knowledgeable about the menu, but wasn't as attentive to our table, there were long waits for our drink order and our bill. The food was delicious. We had to have the cauliflower for a starter since supposedly that is their signature item on the menu. We also had the crispy chicken meatballs, wood fired beef ribs, and grilled ginger steak. We were not disappointed with any of our choices. The beef ribs were meaty, plentiful, and falling off the bone. The mole BBQ sauce was especially pleasing. The steak was cooked to perfection and the ginger sauce was just right. We would definitely come here again, but sit inside to get better service."}
{"text":"Centrally locates good eats. Just waiting for them to bring the curried cauliflower back. The Sunday brunch menu is awesome."}
{"text":"Love the place. Their food is amazing.  Steak, pasta, Ribeye, everything is absolutely delicious. Just close your eyes and put your finger on menu, you won't get disappointed. And on top of that their salads design are so artistic."}
{"text":"This place, oh it just hits it out of the park every time! The owner who's also a sommelier, (Dave) knows what he's doing. He suggested a wonderful bottle of Pinot, in the $100 range but so worth it!  I had asked for something similar to one of my favorite pinots, Belle Glos and he directed us to this magnificent bottle from Russian River.   Now to the food! For starters, we did a Brussels sprouts and fig plate which was very refreshing and tasty. Well balanced. But the winner was the fresh ricotta with sun-dried strawberries with mint and balsamic. It was amazing and so different! It came with fresh bread as well so you could make your own bruschetta, delish!!!!   For our Entrees: we had the smoked parpadelle with chicken ragu in a spicy sausage,  fresh linguine with fresh herbs and preserved lemon. As well as the Chicken thigh. It was all so perfectly prepared & executed. I am Honestly Inot surprised this was voted best new restaurant last year! Well done team!   Oh and the industrial space is so chic and I love  the indoor outdoor design because it really blends well with our native Desert! Ocotillo is my go-to restaurant. It. Can't be beat. And you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I really don't get how this place has good reviews. The food and service is atrocious. My first experience was just ok. I decided to come back and give it another shot. Boy, did I pay for that. I ordered the brisket and it was good! But came out ice cold. I sent it back for another and it came back hot! Only this time the brisket was 80% grizzle and not even edible. By this time I'm over it and don't even order anything else. I decided to nibble on my friends hash browns that he ordered. It's an inch thick fried square. Tasted like morning, no flavor at all. I've literally had better food at Denny's  As far as the service, what service? The host informed us that our server would be right with us, he just had to run to the coffee bar \"real quick\" that real quick was 10 minutes later. The food runner doesn't talk. Literally, he doesn't talk. He dropped food off to me twice and didn't say a word. Not even to ask if I needed anything else. He just dropped the food and took off. My server didn't even come back to check to see how things were. I waited another 10 minutes and had to flag him down just to tell him my food was cold.   I reeeeeeally wanted to like this place, but I can't. I gave it 2 tries but absolutely won't be giving it a third."}
{"text":"Wow. I thought Ocotillo was so gorgeous and the perfect ending to a great week with my colleagues. We had a group dinner on the patio, spread out between two picnic tables, with plenty of heat lamps to keep us warm on a chilly night.   I'm currently doing Whole30 and am very limited to what I can eat. I was super excited to learn that the cauliflower starter could be modified to leave out the peanuts. The cauliflower was absolute perfection and the kale pesto was to die for - probably the best thing I ate all week!   Our server was an absolute sweetheart, and since he had previously done Whole30 as well, he was able to help me make a sensible dinner selection. I ordered the burger over veggies with a side of broccoli rabe in lieu of fries. The broccoli rabe was... broccoli rabe, but the burger was absolutely delicious and the homemade dijonaise alongside was heaven. I wanted to cry when the giant, beautiful desserts were placed on our table but I know there will be another visit to Ocotillo the next time I'm in the area. Coming for you, apple dessert thingy."}
{"text":"We live near so we go here a lot for weekend brunch. They have nice outdoor layout but it's more enjoyable during the cooler seasons. We heard mixed reviews from friends and  associates but we can't complain because never had bad food or service."}
{"text":"I honestly couldn't have asked for a better meal or environment.  My only regret is that I could only go here once while on my trip.  Service (Jenna):  5 stars, she was sweet, great personality, attentive. Atmosphere:  5 stars, what a great space, indoor and outdoor, we went on a Thursday night, but I couldn't believe it wasn't busier. Food:  5 stars, those ribs, holy cow!!!!!!!  Great wine list too and beer was delicious.  The salads are huge, if you order one before your main dish, you may be too full!  Great prices for what you get as well, coming from Napa, we have so much great food, was surprised to find such a great place in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I've been thinking about going to this place for a while, but have been waiting for the whim to actually get off my keister and go. Well...my keister was bored so I finally made it, and I was glad that I did. The service was both down to earth and knowledgable, and I felt at home from the moment I arrived. Questions were happily answered, and suggestions were offered. When I made my choices, there wasn't an ounce of condescension. There wasn't a dish or beverage that I thought was anything but top shelf (I had the cauliflower, the sweet potato, and the fresh pasta with chestnuts). I was surprised that the vegetables were huge, and how much flavor they got out of each dish. The chile butter on the sweet potato alone was worth the trip. Pasta dishes aren't massive (a good thing), but I still couldn't make it to dessert, which were fresh and sounded amazing. I'll be back very, very soon."}
{"text":"Started with the Maine sea urchin with squid ink pasta which was excellent.   The drinks arrived after the appetizer but our waiter did the right thing and comped my beer (he said the delay was because the keg had to be changed).  Mains were beef ribs w espresso mole and Ocotillo chicken.   The ribs (5 meaty bones) were excellent as were the large plate of accompanying fries (served w cilantro and lime - surprisingly a good pairing).  The chicken was juicy and flavorful although the dates underneath were maybe a tad sweet for the dish.   Had the chocolate cobbler for dessert.  Am a big dessert fan and there wasn't anything wrong with it , but after everything else it was \"just fine\".   Overall, a good find and would certainly come back.  Only four stars due to just OK dessert and slightly slow (but friendly) service.  FOLLOW UP COMMENT: I realized when we got the bill that beer was not in fact comp'd (contrary to what we were told).  I took it off the tip instead.  Not a huge deal, but less than ideal."}
{"text":"Today was our first meal at the new restaurant near our home Ocotillo. The food was excellent it was seasoned perfectly service was wonderful we will have many meals here in the future. They are only open midday right now but will soon be open for dinner as well."}
{"text":"One word, \"amazing\"! Came out for girls night in hopes of having a fun time, having a few tasty cocktails, and some yummy appetizers! This place has a very warm atmosphere, with great staff and accommodating seating! Our server, Ryan, did an amazing job and we will definitely be back to request him. Everything came out in a timely fashion, his charisma lightened up our evening and I will be recommending this place to my friends  Thank you for a great evening!"}
{"text":"Imagine ordering a $50 steak and having them serve kraft mac and cheese as a side. That's how I feel when I order a $14 pancake and get Aunt Jemima syrup served with it. I don't know why it's so hard for these nicer restaurants to serve REAL maple syrup with your breakfast?   Anyways. Our first time checking this place out. We were greeting with \"you can sit inside but you have to finish your food within an hour because all of our indoor tables have reservations in an hour.\"   First, hi welcome. Second, what kind of restaurant lets ALL of their tables be reserved for brunch (it wasn't a party/event). I understand they want to make money and brunch is popular, but really, ALL of your tables reserved? Come on.    The food was okay. We had the two egg combo breakfast, the hashbrown cake was different but very good, generous portion of everything. Also got the pineapple upside down pancake and a side of syrup (hence above statement). The pancake was different, it was fluffy but somewhat dry. It seemed to be more dough-like than pancake batter.   Server service was ok. A little slow at first as it looked like he had two parties of 6+ and a few other tables as well as ours. From what it looked like none of the tables ordered when we were sat so it took some time to get things rolling. Debating if we will try it again, but we will make a reservation next time so we don't have to rush."}
{"text":"Super disappointed, our waiter was so rude and took forever so we left. I normally enjoy it there and the overall vibe is good but he was arguing with us about wine and it was pretty awkward.  ***Update, the management and owner reached out to me almost immediately and it's never really about what happens it's about service recovery and they really did a great job. I do enjoy this place and I know I will keep going back.***"}
{"text":"Waited 40 mins just for a table... Got seated at the only table that was open the entire time we waited. Took over an hour for food. Our waitress forgot to put in 2 of our parties meals. Never brought water, coffee, or checked in with our table for anything. Service was terrible. The manager ended up filling our waters and correcting our orders... Cool atmosphere too bad service was inadequate to say the least.... I would have given this place negative stars but Yelp won't let me!"}
{"text":"Had lunch there for a business meeting.  The building has a cool rusted look to it.  Menu has low and high priced items.  Service & Food were good.  They do give big portions which I appreciate.  To me, the noise level was a bit much since I was trying to hear everyone at my table.  I'm sure dining outside when it's not insanely hot would be very nice.  This looks like a great place to have dinner."}
{"text":"Yikes.  We know new restaurants have kinks to work out, so we always give them a couple of chances.  Most realize their issues and work fast to correct.  Not the case in this place.  Food was cold twice (...and so was the coffee....how do you serve cold coffee????).  Service was incredibly slow.  The \"sommelier\" (I use that term loosely), was rude and abrupt.  It also seems they are trying too hard to be hip.  Why is there a DJ rocking out with headphones on during brunch with mellow music?? There are plenty of amazing new restaurants in the Central Phoenix area who care about their customers.  This place just had an attitude of \"Oh, you actually want to place an order and not just revel in our coolness?\" Wish it would have worked out differently...."}
{"text":"One of my friends absolutely loves Ocotillo, swears by them. He put together a group dinner for 10 of us recently for a fun weekend dinner. Nothing special, just a group of friends getting together for a good meal, good drinks, good people. One of the girls and I arrived first to be welcomed with the not-easy parking situation of figuring out where/how to park in the neighborhood - we found a dusty lot nearby which already had a bunch of cars in it. Might be worth them noting on the website about that.  As she and I checked our group in, we stood at the bar to check out fare and drinks. The first thing we noted upon entry was that it definitely has a Mad Men/1960's cool basement vibe. Cute spot to dress up a bit and go out for a date night.  Can I just say how obsessed I am with their Arcadia Spritz drink?! It's like the perfect summer drink for sipping and sitting on a porch with friends. It wasn't much time later [after drinking one full Arcadia drink] that we were sat at a high-top bar and greeted by our server. I really wish I could remember his name, he did a fabulous job. He knew exactly when to come by to each of us with fancy drinks for refills.   My organizer friend highly suggested ordering a bunch of small plates to share among a few people, but no one seemed terribly into that idea. Had there been less of us, the idea might've worked. I was extremely happy that I got my own Campanelle pasta dish with a white sauce and peas. I think it was a seasonal item because it's not on the current menu. It was so rich and flavorful, a highlight of everyone who tried a bit from my bowl. Had we not had plans afterward, I would've taken a to-go box. You can definitely tell a difference between their homemade pasta and normal store-box pasta.   Resident friend-who-is-a-fan also noted that they have great brunch - so it's definitely worth a return trip for that alone and to sit at another part of the restaurant for a new view on their hip dining experience."}
{"text":"Hip new restaurant with fabulous service friendliness and creative food. Loved the ambiance, outdoor patio.. Cauliflower and beets were amazing. A great spot to spend my husbands birthday."}
{"text":"Cool spot with a great location, setup and vibe. However my food came out cold (not cool, but noticeably cold) in the middle and upon being reheated a second time, underwhelmed.  By the time my food came back out, my coworker was done eating. Disappointingly, there was no concession or apology for the mistake. I wasn't even thinking it would be comped, but at least maybe a free drink or something   May or may not be back."}
{"text":"Ocotillo MEDJOUL DATES, SHEEP'S MILK RICOTTA, MARCONA ALMOND, HONEY WARM BREAD PUDDING BOWL, FALL SPICED CREME, ROASTED APPLES DRIED STRAWBERRY SCONE, VANILLA BUTTER, LOCAL HONEY, PECANS IRON SKILLET PANCAKE, WARM FRUIT COMPOTE, POWDERED SUGAR, MAPLE SYRUP  Named after an indigenous plant of the Sonoran Desert and inhabiting a sprawling space that flows freely from indoors to outside and everywhere in between, it was for brunch on Saturday that I arrived at Ocotillo and with dining companions opting out last minute a four-top shrank to seating for one, a limited tasting to follow as the dining room quickly began to buzz.  Priced like a quick-casual concept with a menu steeped in American classics upgraded by fresh local farms, it was with service that hovered between aloof and overworked that a menu was presented and going entirely sweet in formulating a two-course foursome it was with mild amusement that I watched a woman flip out on the hostess regarding seating arrangements, a not-so-subtle reminder of one of the reasons I moved away from the city some 26 months before.  Brilliantly lit by the midday sun, music playing unobtrusively overhead while photographs of the desert decorated the walls, it was with water refilled infrequently that a short wait separated ordering from round-one, a long plate of dates stuffed with ricotta and almonds lent additional sweetness by honey while an enormous pancake arrived too-hot-to-eat in a cast-iron skillet, the toothsome crumb moist even before adding pure maple syrup or spreading the berries with a portion size large enough to feed four.  Joking with a different server than the one assigned my table that the pancake should come with a warning it was with part packaged for later that a brief break ensued, my waiter apparently also covering outdoor seats with the mimosa crowd now in full bloom, a member of the kitchen staff eventually presenting tableside with two plates and an apology, a nice gesture though certainly not necessary.  Admittedly well-sated, the pancake and dates having followed Doughnuts and Pastry elsewhere, it was with good fortune that both the pair of scones and bowl of pudding were far smaller than the items preceding them, the former far more \"British\" than those typically offered in America as fresh berries and \"vanilla butter\" not dissimilar to clotted cream helped temper the dryness, a problem certainly not encountered in buttery bread pudding sopping up the juice of sauteed and slowly melting aromatic cream."}
{"text":"Tonight was mine and my boyfriend's third time at Ocotillo, we can't get enough of the yummy food.   I have never written a review, but tonight was beyond great. We were celebrating our anniversary and our server Mcallister made it so special.  We sat in the main dining room which was a little noisy because every table was filled , but it wasn't unbearable. Mcallister suggested two cocktails to start, one with grilled pineapple infused vodka made in house and another with egg whites and cinnamon. Both were phenomenal.   When it came time to order food he offered to take the reigns and order for us. He started us with a house pulled Mozzarella with carrots three ways, the roasted Cauliflower (our personal favorite) and a bottle of a Grenache blend wine, we both loved the pesto made out of carrot tops!! Second course was a house made pasta with a marinated pulled pork. Last course was the best, a whole fried Mediterranean Sea Bass with a red curry sauce. The presentation was out of this world.   Thanks Ocotillo and Mcallister for making our night unforgettable."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite brunch place in Phoenix. The open area is very inviting, the inside feels like you're in a palace. Oh and the food is incredible.   If a friend comes from out of town, I usually bring them here because it's so centralized in Phoenix's food scene.   I've tried the Breakfast Burger and the Crispy Pork Belly  Burger was rich, had that egg on top that I like so much. But I'd probably not get it again mainly because the menu is so diverse.  However, the Crispy Pork Belly was absolutely amazing. Imagine a giant slab of Pork Belly slow cooked barely to the point of jello, and then deep fried. The crispiness and tenderness in a giant slab of pork fat is the best thing in the world. Paired with Vietnamese spices such as pickled vegetables, peanuts and hoisin sauce, this is something I would order again.  So great ambiance (especially in the cool spring months) and amazing food makes this te best brunch place in Phoenix in my eyes.  Note: This place is very popular even at Sunday morning. People reserve quite often and there's usually a bridal/baby shower out back. My suggestion is to get a bar seat if you want to skip the reservations."}
{"text":"Me and my friends love to come to Ocotillo for lunch, their chicken is amazing this is one of the 5 that they offer Peruvian. And the homemade baked Lamache with Sicilian Ragu sausage and house pulled mozzarella if you haven't been here you have try it. chef Sasha Levine and chef Walter Sterling  have hit a home run!"}
{"text":"Been here twice so far for brunch both times delicious.  Great coffee game,  friendly/helpful  staff,  beautiful design."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to take the time to write this sooner but alas the weekends are just too short.    I had the pleasure of coming here last Saturday evening and noticed I hadn't been here in over 8 months. ALWAYS sit with Josh if you're able. His attention to detail is exquisite even to the degree that he noticed that my I-Phone wasn't charging and brought out his own charging block along with my wife spilling something minor on her blouse and him taking a minute to go get soda water and a black napkin.    Love the updated menu and beverages. The cauliflower 2.0 is as good if not better than the original.    Huge fan of their pasta but I really loved the new smoked parpadelle solely due to the fact that they went with a chicken rather than a beef ragu. Which helped our decision in my wife being able to order the most AWESOME filet of beef - cooked to perfection.   Finishing up everything with the most incredible awe inspiring desserts, the almond joy & deconstructed cheesecake.    Sincerely looking forward to visiting your sister concept Starlite which Josh spoke highly of and I really admired the story behind the name. Living in Arcadia it'll be directly in between both locations.   Thanks again Ocotillo management and Josh.   We'll be back :)"}
{"text":"Update to previous review - Stopped by for dinner and I had the pasta with a corn sauce. It was ok I don't think it really had that much flavor. I was a bit disappointed considering how awesome the last meal here was. My fiancé had the chicken and loved it! He said he had a great flavor and he savored the leftovers the next day! Still would recommend overall!"}
{"text":"I met a long time friend for lunch and our server, Nicole, was amazing! The menu is eclectic and I had no idea what to order.  Nicole was very helpful in guiding us to something we both loved and she was a breath of fresh air! Great atmosphere and wonderful service!"}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant and it was for lunch.   Fantastic season choices. Had the Japanese style fish and chips. Perfectly cooked, not greasy, and had an amazing flavor throughout the dish. Will definitely be going back and even want to see what they do for dinners some time."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed brunch here. Pricier than your average brunch spot, but also better than your average brunch spot. Service was great. Food was delicious and innovative without being obnoxious or over the top. My husband and I shared the blue corn pancake (!!!), the butternut squash quiche, and the pork belly hoisin sauce dish. The brunch cocktails were nothing to write home about, but the coffee from the coffee bar adjacent the restaurant was outstanding. Such a phenomenal experience."}
{"text":"Ok we tried this place AGAIN and their service is still so frustrating. I would use stronger language but it would get flagged. You'd think with this location they would offer some options for food that are unique and interesting, but even the chimichanga (when it's not sold out) is plain and lacking any seasoning. I'm usually more forgiving of a restaurant because they are trying so hard to make things perfect you can tell they're working out the kinks. But here you can tell that this is as good as it's going to get.   The service is hit and miss. The table next to you will get there 20 minutes after you and leave before you having finished everything. This has happened THREE times now. It's a joke and is so unacceptable.   And every time you go there, they're out of something. First sangria, then chimichanga, then sangria! So you think those things are off the chain, right? Well you'd be wrong. This is a mediocre crew running a beautiful space. I hope they figure this out before Phoenix wakes up and smells the coffee (brewing down the street). Good riddance Ocotillo. You've driven away another group of customers. The only redeeming quality is the location and the manager who was putting out fires left and right the whole time we were there.   UPDATE- Walter S who identifies himself as the owner/chef just called me a dick in a compliment and can't wait to see me again. I have the note saved on my phone. Honestly, why would anyone support this place?"}
{"text":"Awesomeness on the rib-eye, perfectly cooked medium rare...yum! And the Knob Creek old fashioned was perfect by Barrymore."}
{"text":"Great new restaurant.   We made reservations on a Friday night.  We were about 15 minutes early so we grabbed a drink at the bar.  I like how open and roomy it is.  The bar has plenty of room and you are not standing on top of each other waiting around.  The drinks were strong and well made, although no one makes an Old Fashioned like Bretton at Ten. Our table was ready right on time.  The dining room is very attractive and modern.  Our server was great at answering our questions and making recommendations.  4 of us started with the chicken wings and the ricotta cheese.  I would definitely get the ricotta cheese again.  I would skip the wings next time and order one of the salads.  The table next to us shared a salad to start and it looked incredible. 2 of us ordered the beef ribs.  They were awesome.  Meaty and flavorful.  A ton of food.  The fries were well done, but I only picked at them because the ribs were so good.   2 ordered pasta dishes which were also well done.  The pasta is made from scratch and cooked perfectly.  Both agreed the pasta was good, but would like to return to try something different like the Ocotillo Chicken or the Ribeye.   Unfortunately, they only had 2 dessert choices left by the end of the night.  That was a little disappointing because there are some very appetizing pictures on Yelp of their desserts.  Next time.   We also asked our server about their brunch options.  She brought us the menu and told us about unlimited mimosas.  Sold.  We will be there very soon to try brunch while the weather is still decent."}
{"text":"I wanted to have a special dinner with friends who were only in town for one night.  This was NOT the place to take them. Although the outside area is pleasant, our service was terrible.  No one seemed to be able to describe the items on the menu without checking with the chef, and the wait person went so far as to say he wasn't a \"pasta person\" himself so he couldn't recommend any particular pasta dish. When he spilled water all over the table he excused himself by saying it didn't really matter since it was a picnic table.   The \"Small Plates\" are actually tiny for the price.  This would be OK if they were actually good, but the (three) seared scallops were drenched in hot chili's that totally destroyed their subtle flavor while the asparagus with a dressing mix of cream and ramps was old, dry and overpriced.   The rest of the menu was ambitious in its off-the-wall  combination of flavors and ingredients, but less than successful in its actualization.  Just combining foods and spices in an original way does not mean the result is tasty. The kitchen seems to think that quinoa, garlic, ramps, pumpkin, blueberries, blah blah, arugula, blah blah, protein can be thrown together to impress,  just because of  the number of ingredients, no matter how poorly they combine on the palate.    The wine and beer menu was not up to date and the waiter didn't know what was actually currently available until it was ordered.   Aside from that... at least the weather was great."}
{"text":"Amazing spot.  Really cool atmosphere, comfortable and inviting.  Great service, knowledgable and accommodating.  Food was excellent!  everything we had was on point.  good presentation, great taste, and appropriate portion sizes.  Highly recommend, will be back soon!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots for brunch in Phoenix! The brunch menu is extensive, choices for everyone. Light, savory, sweet.. you know name it. Every plate I have tried here has impressed, and service is always wonderful! Mystic was our waitress this morning, she is super sweet and friendly! I ordered the ahi tuna and charred carrots, my husband got the fried chicken with an egg and we ALWAYS order the blue corn pancake to share (it's a must, we can never finish it and go home with leftovers because it is huge, but so so tasty!). On Sunday it does have a \"Sunday funday\" vibe inside with a DJ so we typically sit outside although the music is never too loud, just provides a nice fun vibe. I can't wait to try ocotillo for dinner!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been to Ocotillo. The first time was during the day(and it was excellent). This time I went with a group of four for dinner. We started with the house specialty, Roasted Cauliflower, which came with a kale pesto. This is the best cauliflower I have ever tasted. I recommend you go there just to try this dish. 5/5. The second appetizer we consumed was the Chicken Meatballs. This came with shishito peppers, and a light sauce. They were tasty due to the cayenne pepper flavoring which was mixed directly into the meat. However, they were a little bit dry. 4/5.  For our main dishes, I had the Reginette Pasta with a Lamb Ragu. It had great flavoring and had plentiful sun-dried tomatoes mixed in. The Ragu was also plentiful, and the noodles were cooked al dente style, which really added to the flavor and consistency. I highly recommend this dish. 5/5. One other in my party had the Campanella Pasta with roasted mushrooms. It was prepared in a light cream sauce, and it was also very well crafted. 5/5. The next entrée we shared was the Ginger Steak. The cut was a ribeye that came with roasted sesame potatoes. It was cooked medium well (not my preference), but was still very enjoyable. 5/5. The final dish we all sampled was the Roasted Fish, which was Halibut prepared with a light sauce. I wasn't overly crazy about this dish as it did not contain the same powerful, well combined flavors as the other meals. 4/5.  For dessert we share the bread pudding and chocolate pie. Both were incredible, And help finish off a great culinary experience. 5/5.  The ambience was absolutely fabulous. We sat outside and the weather was gorgeous. The only complaint I had is that the service was very slow, and some of the wait staff were more concerned with standing around and comparing tattoos then helping the guests. I originally awarded four stars, but was immediately contacted by the GM. Very impressive and conscientious individual who is seeking to improve his restaurant. I now am amending my review and awarding Ocatillo five stars! I highly recommend you try out this restaurant!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! Visited for the first time a few days ago with a friend and the setting was very cool, modern and hip. Very busy and loud but I think that adds to the ambience. Everything we ordered was DELICIOUS! started with the meatball appetizer had the pasta with the pork ragu and finished with the chamomile panna cotta and I can't wait to go back to get it all again!!! Can't wait to go back when he weather isn't so hot because they have a really great outdoor area! The service was so-so but it won't stop me from coming back and giving it another try!"}
{"text":"Melt in your mouth. I cannot wait to visit this place again. It is on the pricey side so I would recommend it for a special occasion with that special someone. The atmosphere was really laid back, the only downside was that the music was a little loud, but it was damn good music anyway. Would say reservations are a must, we went on a Saturday night with no reservation and had a little bit of  a wait. Thankfully the outside patio is a great place to relax while you wait."}
{"text":"Are you kidding?  A four star rating?  This place is a foodie Mecca.  The ribs are out of this world.  There is a mountain of beef ribs that is too good to stop eating and too much to finish.  Nice problem.  The cauliflower with pesto and peanuts is a must.  The owner is always there.  This place is one of the best in Phoenix!!"}
{"text":"Everyone seemed friendly, especially Eli.  He was the only person who introduced himself to me so naturally I remembered his name.  The only issue was the hostess.  She didn't want to give us a table outside because they were all reserved...at 8pm.  We were there at 5pm LOL.  The place.  Trendy/classy set up inside, and casual outside.  Inside was very loud, which could get in the way of a good conversation.  We sat outside at one of the picnic tables in the beer garden.  It was nice that heaters were placed on both sides of the picnic tables.  Most restaurants don't understand that.  The outside is very spacious with lots of standing area.    The food.  We had beets, broccoli, mushrooms, pork steak, chicken wings, and ceviche.  The ceviche was weird.  The sauce that came with the broccoli had a goat cheese type flavor.  For dinner, the chitarra pasta with clams was pretty good.  But the best....pork steak and french fries.  Warning, the pork was a little pink if you're okay with that.  I believe the pickled veggies with peanuts were taken from a famous Vietnamese salad recipe.  The flavor was all too similar.  Works for me because I like the flavor.  Most of the dishes didn't have much flavor.  No one really bragged about their meal, except the 17 year old who loved the ribs and chicken.  What growing 17 year old boy doesn't love a huge plate of ribs or chicken?  After a few bottles of wine and $400 later, we had a great night with friends and watched the Cardinals beat the Packers."}
{"text":"This place is great! The House Bucatini pasta was awesome along with the lemongrass pork steak!"}
{"text":"The 4 of us went out to dinner for the first time at Ocotillo. It was my preggo friend's pick since she wanted us to have a group dinner before her baby came and she was really excited...sadly, I don't think any of us will ever dine here again.  PROS -Ocotillo chicken - crispy and flavorful, I loved the potatoes  -The others liked the rabbit tagliatelle pasta the most, great texture and was very rich  CONS -Service, service service - my preggo friend just wanted some bread and it took us 4 tries on asking for it...3 times to the server and once to the food runner, the female server (Liyala, sp?) was very rude when my friend asked for the bread...she responded with something along the lines of \"I already put in the order, do you want to get me fired?\" It was terribly unprofessional. Also, when she dropped off the bread about 2-3 dishes in, there was no butter or olive oil so we had to ask her for that too. -The Octopus - I am an octopus snob, it was severely dry and lacked any flavor, everyone was not impressed -Pork belly skewers - I get it, pork belly is very trendy now but they over fried it and you could barely taste any of the pork. the dish was served in such a clunky way - there was this massive side of greens that were not dressed and were cut up in either super small or super large pieces...not sure what we were supposed to do with that  The overall energy of the space was very upbeat and loud and the outside patio looked great but service and overall experience is very important to us and being East Valley folks, we will not be making the trek all the way to Phx for average food and below average service."}
{"text":"so i just moved here from california and my aunt wanted to go to dinner here. unfortunately we were in between services so we weren't able to have access to the full menu but...... What we were offered was more than amazing! I ordered the chicken wings and they were ginormous ! Not only that they were well seasoned. Also got to try the chicken meatballs which were incredible! definitely going back the ambiance was DOPE! love the fire pits outside definitely a go to spot before the winter season is over. DONT forget to make your reservation!"}
{"text":"Ocotillo is such a great place with awesome food and ambiance. Had the steak and eggs OMG. The best I have had especially for the price. Great consideration and energy goes into the food. This place is a hit and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"OMG, I made a mistake on my initial review of this eatery; completely sidelined by other events, my \"dining\" notes were inadvertently used for this establishment, rather than the correct one.  And, but for the sincere response by the GM of this food establishment, my 1-star review would have gone un-corrected.  I have since edited it.  My review  (since deleted) was wrong, wrong, wrong.  It was in Ocotillo that I had the pork sandwich or Torta; and it was great. I had lunch there during the work week, so it was somewhat busy.  The staff was attentive and the price was  a little above what I would pay for the meal (about $13 or $14), but it was very good, fresh and I left nothing behind.  I had planned to stop over on a Sunday for the brunch, I believe this is where I confused my initial review about Ocotillo with the place I had selected instead (Sunday brunch trip).  So Sorry Ocotillo... but, I made it up with four-stars.... !!!!!     Kisses."}
{"text":"8pm reservation...arrived early and got seated at 7:50.   7:55 - waiters and what looks to be like a manager or owner have an argument by our table...waiter walks by and apologizes.  8:00 - no water no waiter  8:05 - no water no waiter   8:06 - we walk out  Would have liked to try what looks to be delicious and creative dishes...hopefully they get their act together on the service!"}
{"text":"Brunch here was a good idea. There was a Dj right in front of us right when we walked in. The atmosphere was so outgoing and kinda loud. But I liked it.   Out waiter was really nice and had so much to say about the menu. The menu didn't have much for me as a vegetarian *sad face* so I end up with vegetable quiche.  It came with the side salad. It was very tasty. The quiche was quite dry, so I end up eating it with hot sauce.  My friends had the brisket. They loved it.  I order the roasted chicken sandwich to go for my fiancé... he said \"this chicken is so good. Imagine if I was eating there and it came out hot\" haha so yeah. He liked his sandwich.   I want to come here for dinner. I'll call in advance to see if the chef can modify a vegetarian dish for me."}
{"text":"Stopped by for brunch and really enjoyed the atmosphere outside. Inside seemed a little too \"pinky-up\" for my taste. I'm fine sharing a picnic type table outside with other people.  I had the pork flautas and they were delicious. Came very well presented. I almost felt bad eating it! Almost. Good deal on the mimosas and pretty much everything I saw coming out of the kitchen looked amazing. I'll absolutely be frequenting this place again."}
{"text":"I've been to this place quite a few times now,  both for personal events and with business associates.  We have not been disappointed yet.  Love the food and the atmosphere.  The brussel sprout/kale salad is a favorite, I have to get it every time.  I keep telling myself to try a different salad, but I LOVE this one and even find myself craving it.  The falafel burger is another favorite and of course the ribs!  The wine and cocktail selections are extensive, something for everyone.  Brunch is very busy on weekends so go at an off time, maybe 1 or 2pm to void the crowds.  Ocotillo has become one of our go-to favorites, and it's a great place to bring out of town guests!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful time at Ocotillo Sunday morning for brunch! Great patio and garden too. Max was a very attentive server and made our third visit wonderful. Excited to return!"}
{"text":"Visited today for the first time.   Beautifully designed spaces, staff was SO friendly and innovative and delicious food.   It could easily be a pretentious place but isn't!!  David was our server and was so great we ended up becoming friends today!"}
{"text":"Took a ride on the back of the bike with a friend and decided on this spot based on word of mouth from friends.   I felt somewhat out of place with my helmet hair and all, but the service was friendly and quick. Not overbearing and perfect for hilarious conversation. :D   I ate the blue corn pancakes with agave syrup. Dude. I'm not really a corn person. I mean corn is okay, but it's...corn. These were amazing. I can't really speak to what my friend had because it was gone in like three minutes (gains food bruh) and I totally forgot what they had.   All in all it was a pleasant experience, and next time I'm up in the area I may visit again. :)"}
{"text":"Loved this place so much. I am from out of state and we stopped here on our way to the airport. I'm so glad we did! I had a cocktail there that was my favorite cocktail from the whole trip! It was called the bumble bee. AMAZING.   I wish that we were more hungry when we came because the pasta looked and sounded perfect. Instead we shared two vegetable plates- one was the tomato tartine and the other was braised collard greens. The lemon ricotta on the tartine was brilliant, bright and perfect for the dish. We also had zucchini bread for dessert with these cheese cake balls. You can really tell the owners and chefs are very passionate about food and presentation. I would love to eat here and try everything but I am so far away :(   The food here really speaks for itself. And so does the decor! We sat on the patio at night and it was so perfect. I was even impressed with how nice and perfectly decorated the bathrooms were! The menus were tastefully organized. The plates, tables, couches, fire place, plants etc. I loved this place! They even have an outdoor cat who lives there and I was entertained watching him walk around. He even surprised me chillin in the bathroom. So cute.  And lastly the service. I wish I remembered his name! Huge shoutout to him for giving us the best service on the trip! He spent a lot of time talking to us about Arizona and food and everything. He was so passionate about the menu and drinks and was excited when we picked what we wanted. I had him choose our dessert for us cause I couldn't decide. It really made the visit one to remember. So thank you for that!"}
{"text":"My husband and I finally had a chance to go here last night; it was worth the wait. The menu items seemed to be creative twists on old favorites mixed with originality and international flair. We had the smoked beets that were to die for and ribs with an espresso mole that should be bottled and sold it's that good. We also had the carpaccio, the oysters with caviar and truffle oil, chocolate cobbler for dessert - even the cappuccino was as good as it gets. Did I mention the service and atmosphere? - impeccable. Next time, we'll split an entree as they don't skimp on the portions. Definitely a first rate experience."}
{"text":"Ocotillo Restaurant is in Downtown Phoenix off of 3rd St and Osborn Rd. The grounds are large and easy to find. The whole space has a really open and airy feel to it. The concept is quite eclectic and different as they have a ton of unique flavor combinations and the menu itself is HUGE. My first visit was a promotional lunch for the app BumbleBFF. The staff had given us a large corner booth table by the window which provided more than enough space for all of us. We could not wait another minute to put in some pitchers of Sangria. They also brought fruit plates which were presented beautifully. I chose the House Smoked Salmon board. I was blown away by the presentation and freshness of the ingredients. The smoked salmon was some of the best I've had. It was paired with capers, tea egg, pickled shallots, dill creme, and perfectly grilled seeded bread. The portion was just what I needed. The waiter was so gracious and took care of us the entire time. I don't think this event would have been nearly as memorable had it been anywhere else. We all left with happy hearts and full belly's. My second visit to Ocotillo was for a family dinner. We put in a couple of appetizers like the Halibut Ceviche and the Grilled Heirloom Squash. Both were tasty and light. Perfect appetizers if you're trying to taste a lot of things on the menu. I am a pasta lover so to say I was excited to try their pasta's is an understatement. I gravitated towards the Baked Lumache Pasta with butternut squash, winter greens, goat cheese, parmesan and bread crumbs. This was so incredibly creamy and rich. Plus the portion was massive. My only complaint was that it had a bit too much sauce, I felt bad wasting so much of it. We were happy we got to try so much on the menu and all agreed the ingredients tasted fresh in every dish.  My most recent visit was for an anniversary brunch. We started off with mimosas and ended up regretting not just doing the pitcher deal for $18 which came out to about 4 mimosas which we ended up having by the end of the meal anyway. This time around I really wanted to try their 'SWEET' section on their menu as it has always caught my eye. We had the Warm Cinnamon Rolls which sits in a warm skillet on a small puddle of maple syrup. The inside lined with Apple Jam and topped with Maple Frosting. I was hesitant about the Sun Dried Strawberries in Balsamigo with herbed ricotta, basil and country bread. It sounded sweet and I was afraid it would be too much. I was wrong as the sweetness was subtle and the herbed ricotta balanced it out. It's a unique flavor combination but it got better with every bite. There wasn't nearly enough bread, just one more piece would have been perfect for the significant amount of spread left over. Lastly, the Fried Chicken sat in a hefty pile of parmesan polenta with a fried egg on top and scallions covered in truffle honey. This visit to Ocotillo was relaxing and we surprised ourselves with our choices but left feeling more than satisfied.  Read full review on http://johannagraff.com/ocotillo-restaurant/"}
{"text":"I came here with a big party and the service was spectacular. The managers came by to make sure everything was taken care of. Our server Josh accommodated the birthday girl, and provided the best service I have ever experienced. He provided a thorough breakdown of the menu since we were all new. He took our order in a timely manner and handled our party of 15 effortlessly. I would definitely come again because of his service!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here during lunch hour. By the look of it from the outside it didn't appear to be too busy but once you got inside you could tell it's a popular spot. The inside though is quite noisy. If you are planning on having a good convo with someone you might think about sitting outside to actually hear them and not have to talk loud. The back seating area is the best. They have long picnic type tables to sit at which makes it nice for groups. Service was definitely lacking though. We sat for about 5 mins before a waiter actually came over to us. The food was decent. Nothing I could rave about but it might have been just what I got. The others in my party seemed to enjoy their food. So minus the service which is why I did not give it 5 stars I'd say this place is decent."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in the mid-town Phoenix area. The menu is incredibly eclectic, but all the flavors are fantastic. We especially enjoy the brunch menu and the vibe. Definitely a little hipster, but there is no sense of pretentiousness. Everyone is very nice.  The architecture and layout of the restaurant is very unique in a good way. You can eat in a modern indoor or patio, in an indoor or outdoor bar, lounging on a couch, on the lawn, at the coffee shop or on a picnic table. Crazy part is that it works very well and does not feel disjointed.  Why 4 stars? Minor things. Service could tighten up a bit, and hopefully will with time (still relatively new). Also the proportion of carb to meat on a few of the sammiches is off."}
{"text":"Sadly, this review is based only on about 5 minutes of actual interaction. I've been wanting to try Ocotillo for a while after meeting someone in Kauai who had ties to the owner. We were in the area and decided to give it a shot. First of all, the space is very well done. We were impressed from first entrance. When we walked in, we waited for a few minutes til we were greeted. Not a big deal, since we were checking the place out. Upon sitting down though, the disappointment began. Maybe our server was having a bad day, maybe it's because her shift was ending and she had a table sit down, I don't know, but she was not a happy camper. She offered us an additional beverage to water, and I hadn't quite decided yet, so I told her I would figure it out. My boyfriend inquired if brunch was the only option - she not so pleasantly informed us that brunch is it, and in fact the kitchen was about to close. It was 2:40pm! 1. We were disappointed that the hours aren't more clearly shared on their website. 2. It was really the delivery of this information that made the experience a negative one. The way it was delivered, we definitely had the impression that we were an inconvenience in being there. So, we decided we didn't want to be \"those people\", and got up and left. I have a feeling this isn't how a typical experience at Ocotillo goes, but unfortunately that's how ours went. Of course I'm disappointed we didn't get to try the menu I'd so been looking forward to, but more than that, the service we received was the major downfall.   So for future reference, their kitchen closes at 3pm on Saturdays! Not sure when it reopens, as we never even got that far as to get that information."}
{"text":"This place is great. It has something for everyone. We are celebrating with our friends and marriage today. We selected Baked Creste Di Gallo Pasta and the Whole Fried Lobster. What a great dinner to acompany a wonderful celebration."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch this morning (their first brunch service) and was shocked at how great everything was! How I didn't notice this place going up is beyond me as I drive by many times a week, but I didn't. This place is HUGE, like a compound almost. They have a huge yard/patio, the restaurant with a bar, a separate bar, and a separate coffee bar. The buildings were mostly made of old shipping containers, which was super neat. I went with a meetup group and the restaurant was very accommodating for our (very) large party.    For food, I had the brioche with red eye gravy and bacon and also got to try the cast iron pancake and the breakfast chimichanga. Out of all I tried, I felt like my brioche was the best item. The  bread itself was sweet and played well with the savory gravy, crispy bacon, perfectly sautéed greens, and runny egg. The pancake was giant and tasty, topped with fruit compote. The chimi was also a large portion, that looked perfectly crispy. Unfortunately, I think they preroll these things because they can't change the contents of the burrito, but the flavor was decent. This was probably my least favorite of the three. Needless to say, I will definitely return to this restaurant for brunch, booze, and other meals!"}
{"text":"It's possible that I've had worse service somewhere, but can't remember where. It took about 15 minutes after being seated to flag down a waiter to get water and a menu - another ten to place a drink order, yet another 10 to find out that one of the ingredients for the holiday drink special was unavailable, so my companion said, \"that's OK just make it without that ingredient.\" It took another 5 minutes for me to find the manger, have the waiter return only to tell my friend that the bartender doesn't make the drink without the ingredient. The lunch took nearly 60 minutes to arrive.  The food quality was very uneven. My soup was excellent, but my friend's fish and chips order was flavorless and overcooked.  Very, very loud."}
{"text":"This is my ultimate favorite brunch location. Everything is delicious, avocado toasts and skillet pancake tops the list. Egg dishes deserve honorable mention. Staff is very friendly and bloody Mary's are pretty amazing. I have nothing negative to say."}
{"text":"I want to love this place so much but it's been hit or miss the two times I've been. The atmosphere is fantastic and so are the drinks. If you are looking for a place to meet up with some friends and have a few drinks, then this is definitely the place to go. But, the food is just so so and the service is spotty. On my first visit we just had drinks, which were great, but the service was pretty bad ( had to find someone for water, another drink, to pay, etc). On my second visit service was great but the food was so so. I liked the fried zucchini. My husband had the ribeye and it wasn't just really fatty, it was kind of grisly. I had the Asian chicken dumpling soup- they aren't actually dumplings, more like chicken meatballs. That's fine, but the broth was way too sweet. It was missing that umami taste that a good hot pot has.  Anyway, I really really want to put this place on my go to list because it's got such a great vibe. But, I can't justify paying $120 plus for drinks and so so food."}
{"text":"Walked in to meet a friend for a late lunch and the noise level was so bad we had to leave.   I probably won't try it again."}
{"text":"Very hipster atmosphere with a decadent and scrumptious creative and outside the box menu. Overall a great experience for our first visit to Phoenix and if I am in the area again I will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"This 1 of my best places to eat, they have great food, and the service is wonderful. I would recommend this place to all my friends and family. When im in the neighborhood I always try to eat there. Oh did I say the verity of food is fantastic, I love this place. Alain B"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic dining experience. I came here with my boss for a celebration dinner and enjoyed every minute. We met one of the owners as he was introducing himself and welcoming guests. Our server, Milan, made our dinner even more enjoyable. His knowledge for the menu and attention to our every need was very impressive. When we return, I hope that he is our server again. The food was phenomenal, I would highly recommend the salmon to anyone. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"There was a lot of talk about this restaurant's patio space. We came in for brunch on an April afternoon, wanting to take advantage of the weather along with some mimosa intoxication. I think the \"beer garden\"/patio section is wildly overrated. There was nothing that was truly appealing to any of my senses. Luckily, the food they serve did not sing the same tune.   We got started with mimosas. They actually serve an entire bottle of prosecco with the side of OJ. This was pretty cool and not nearly as expensive as I was expecting it to be. We decided to place food orders. I picked the Mediterranean board which came with pita bread, pickled vegetables, hummus, dill and yogurt sauce, kalamata olives and cheese. This was actually pretty amazing. It took a little bit of effort to put all the ingredients together for each bite. But the flavors were great together. I had also ordered a side of bacon. I like my bacon slightly crispy so I had them take it back and put it back on the pan to render it some more. The server came back in 30 seconds with dry bacon, devoid of any fat. Clearly, it was thrown in the microwave and cooked rapidly. This was slightly disappointing. My friend decided to get the fried chicken. It was served with polenta and a fried egg. This also was a pretty great dish. The chicken was perfectly cooked, polenta creamy and egg cooked well. They fared pretty well in the food department. The underwhelming patio space doesn't convince me enough to drive all the way for another visit. But certainly not bad food."}
{"text":"Fantastic food.  The cauliflower could be a meal itself.  Everything has an amazing complexity of flavors with a Mediterranean influence.   Can't wait to try brunch."}
{"text":"We started off at the coffee bar/shack/thing they have onsite. Overall, incredibly slow service. They offer high-quality coffee, I just wish the person working in the bar/shack/thing knew what he was doing because it was clear he has no experience serving coffee. I ended up getting a tea to play it safe but overall, I wouldn't visit this part of Ocotillo again.  As for the actual restaurant, again, very slow service. Our server was moping around, no sense of urgency and gave a really bad impression. I was a server for many years and this guy was not cutting it.  As for the food, I ordered the Oaxaca half chicken and boy was it delicious. The mole sauce on the chicken had an awesome flavor, the chicken was tender and a great portion. The black beans were good and the cilantro lime rice was solid. The rice had A LOT of lime in it (which I enjoy) but others may not.  The grounds around the restaurant are very well kept and look very nice. The atmosphere of the restaurant was nice but didn't flow well with the grounds of the entire restaurant area. The restaurant felt more... formal.  I won't go out of my way to come back here but if friends invite us, I'd be back strictly for the food."}
{"text":"Heard of this place over and over again in various local articles, so when we were in Scottsdale again we went out of our way to come over and have brunch. It lived up to the hype, creative food and good portions. Had brisket and blue corn pancakes. Will come back again, for sure."}
{"text":"Amazing grilled salmon sandwich and a phenomenal salad, I added salmon to mine and it was to die for highly recommend this place great space and fun atmosphere!! Go on Friday Saturday and Sunday's for a good time"}
{"text":"Ocotillo is quite the handsome restaurant. From the outside, it makes a strong first impression -- especially at night. The architecture and lighting blend wonderfully into the surrounding environment. It's as inviting as it is sexy.  It's also pretty inventive. As I am wont to do, I began my evening with a cocktail. My #16 was a desert surprise of deliciousness. Were I not so OCD about wine with dinner, I would have happily sipped on this all night. The dining portion of the evening started just as strong. Many reviews are going to spend time talking about the Carrot Fattoush Salad. There is a reason for this. It's divine and when ordered without pita, it's gluten-free. The salad is an intensely deliberate mix of greens, carrot hummus, herbs (I don't know which; they've gotta be secret, like the Colonel made famous), feta, seeds, and coriander vinaigrette. Yes, that dressing is a real thing and it's spectacular. Not to be outdone, the cauliflower appetizer (a delightful concoction of the vegetable, kale pesto, lemon, olive oil, basil, mint,  and peanuts) and the duck confit also pressed my buzzer and rang my bell. I was riding high off the incredible start to the meal and the evening. I turned to my friend with wide-eyed incredulousness as to what we were experiencing.  Strong start.  Unfortunately, the finish didn't compare. By no means was the second part of the meal poor. But the beginning of the evening was so stellar that coming down to earth where the mere mortals roamed was a comparative disappointment. The service which had been be-my-guestish turned a bit perfunctory. It get it: waiting on a large group with seemingly insatiable demands gets to a person. Again, I don't want it to seem as though things ever got rude. Just relative to the start, the shift was noticeable. I received a weak pour of an ordinary-tasting cab. Yes, first world. But relative to the cocktail, noticeable. My Ocotillo Chicken entree was more exciting on the page than the plate. The intoxicating description (chilies, citrus, honey, and herbs served with a roasted pecan and date potato salad) didn't live up to the execution. The chicken, while nicely cooked (juicy and not at all dry) was rather bland, especially when given the flavor bomb with which it was prepared. The potato salad lacked the interesting wow I anticipated given the unusual recipe. I didn't have a chance to taste the dessert options as none were gluten-free. I wasn't too put out. I'd had a very filling and -- on-the-whole -- satisfying meal. Yes, it was a bit uneven but nothing that should make anyone shy away from experiencing Ocotillo for him/herself. If I were to return, I would make an evening of the cocktail menu and vegetables. Both are just that good. Actually, they're better."}
{"text":"We had a very good lunch, big portions, fresh and healthy food choices.  David the owner, was very accommodating and helpful. He offered multiple suggestions of neighborhood restaurants to check out during our trip We ordered the cauliflower and fish and chips. Both dishes were delicious! And the fresh coconut was great"}
{"text":"My family and I love coming to Ocotillo for the amazing food, wonderful ambiance, and exceptional service! Tonight my wife and I stopped by for coffee and dessert and the two of us had a great time! We live very far away but stop in every chance we get! Our server tonight was very friendly and diligent as she attended to our needs for caffeine and sweets! The GM was checking with customers and we ended up having a very pleasant conversation with him. We always enjoy Ocotillo and can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix. The wait staff is incredible. My servers name was Mac, among unparalleled service he is the best. They accommodated every special request I had (due too my many dietary restrictions) and treated me like royalty. If you are looking for somewhere to eat ocotillo is the place."}
{"text":"Crazy good food. Crazy noisy! In spite of the ridiculous noise level in this contemporary eatery, it is a must-stop for any foodie. We dined mid-week at lunch and shared 3 different options: Gem Lettuce salad (yum), Mesquite Brisket sandwich (double yum), and Ocotillo Chicken (5 yums). This is Cuisine, not just food. I would recommend going on a nice day when you can sit outside or go with someone you don't want to have to talk to! The server did tell us they are measuring for carpeting and will be installing drapes or other furnishings to absorb noise, so lots of people must've complained."}
{"text":"Ambience: A+ Cleanliness: A+ Customer Service: A+ Food: A+  Price  -It is very hard for me to comment on price in Arizona because coming from NY everything seems very cheap. The people who I was with (the locals) say its moderately priced so I'll defer to them.  Atmosphere -I didn't go inside but the outside patio part is HUGE and gorgeous with these amazing lights strung up everywhere. There is also a bar and this huge grassy area which is nice for getting your snapchat photo shot on, I'm sure that's probably not what its meant for but that's what we used it for.    Customer Service  Everybody was so nice. My waiter asked me what my name was and used it throughout the evening which I thought was a nice little touch. I have zero complaints about the service.   Food  So me and my group didn't order any entrees but we ate our weight in appetizers and everything that came out was delicious. I was talking to the owner and he was explaining how most of their food is locally sourced and regardless of were you fall on the organic vs. non organic debate, the fact that the food is locally sourced means that the restaurant is good for the local economy and that alone should give it some extra points. I had this fruit platter and I the strawberries tasted like the ones I pick from my garden. There is nothing better than fresh produce!    Overall I came here on the last day of a service trip with ten of my classmates and we all had a great time and left with our bellies full. Great local place!"}
{"text":"I debated between giving this place 3 stars and 4 stars, let's say it's a 3.7.  What it has going for it -- atmosphere is really hip, trendy, and gentrified in an area that isn't really any of those things.  Similar vibe to Postino and the Yard.  It's a sprawling complex of a restaurant that is  unusual for the area.  The food is also good!  I ordered the spinach salad with salmon and the fruit salad.  The fruit salad was good, but a little on the high end price wise for what you got.  The spinach salad was good and filling and it was enough food that I couldn't even finish.  I liked that although it was drenched in dressing, the dressing was so light that it wasn't overwhelming.  Also, the salad had hard boiled eggs in it that were cooked just perfectly.  Not overdone and not underdone.  That's kind of a tough feat for hard boiled eggs, so I liked that.  However, I would have liked it better if instead of just doing spinach, they would have done mixed greens that included spinach.  Eating all that spinach gets a little monotonous after a while.  What I didn't like was that on a Sunday it was very busy and kind of hard to get quick service.  We sat at the bar and felt like we were waiting a lot (to order... to get the bill... you get it).  Also, our server/bartender was a little too jokey.  I don't need every answer to one of my questions to be a joke, you can just... answer my questions."}
{"text":"This place looks awesome!!!! Lots of space, semi fancy. The menu apparently changes pretty often. Their drinks... bomb. I went with my bf and we asked the waiter for advice on the menu. He recommended the lasagna, which was vegetarian. I think it would have been good if it hadn't been semi burned. You know when it's over cooked and everything is stiff when you try to cut it? Yea that's what happened... My bf ordered the short rib pasta. That was really good but the portion was a bit smaller than we were expecting. Next time, I'd probably order an appetizer, the short rib pasta and of course a drink"}
{"text":"Cool Italian Mexican fusion mixed with a little vegetarian. Excellent menu. Very large restaurant with lots of space on the grounds. Very new still have not started serving dinner but will in the next month. Definitely worth coming down and checking out. Will be an up and coming restaurant in this neighborhood."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I tried Ocotillo again last night and had a much better experience. David, the GM kindly greeted us and our server, Nicole, was very attentive and courteous throughout the night.   We started out with the newly added chilled asparagus salad and it was absolutely amazing. The asparagus was perfectly blanched so that it still maintained it's crispness after being cooked and chilled. We both had the salmon and it was equally as good and seasoned beautifully. Although we don't normally have desert, we decided to splurge since it was my fiancé's birthday and had the strawberry rhubarb biscuit and the chocolate pie. Both were good and definitely worth saving room for.   Needless to say, Ocotillo has won me back and definitely deserved the upgraded rating."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner on a Wednesday night. The space is nice. We loved the outdoor seating (that's where we sat), but we also liked the look and feel of the indoor space. We ordered the Sazerac cocktail, the gin cocktail,pork steak, the wings, and the Campanelle pasta dish. The cocktails were good. The pork steak was good...until we tasted mint in the dish. What? Mint did not go with the dish at all, it was as if someone in the kitchen accidentally grabbed the wrong greens!!! But the worst part is that half of the dish was completely raw!! Next, we had the wings...nothing special. If you eat wings and get all messy, you want it to be worth all the ness in and around and between your nails..this was not worth the mess. The last dish we had was the campanelle pasta. It was pretty good, but not really good. Not the kind of good that makes you want to cone back. I have to be honest that it was quite surprising to see that they had not taken the raw pork steak off of our bill. Bad move, Ocotillo. My husband and I love food. We love trying new restaurants. We love finding new favorites. Unfortunately we will not be back to Ocotillo and we will not recommend it to our friends."}
{"text":"This is a great place to grab appetizers or drinks with friends on a nice spring evening.  Ocotillo has a gorgeous outdoor sitting area, complete with a firepit and a friendly cat.  We split a ton of different dishes, but the standouts were the Cauliflower (served in this delicious curry sauce that made me want to lick the plate), Brussel Sprouts, and the Ahi Tuna.  Every one of the small/vegetable dishes we ordered was light and refreshing.  Our individual \"large\" dishes, on the other hand, lived up to that name.  My husband ordered the ribs, which literally melted in your mouth and fell off the bone, but they were SO filling!  We barely even had room for the huge plate of accompanying fries.  I think this dish could probably be split between two people comfortably.  I had the recommended chicken dish, which was delicious.  It was unique that instead of being served over mash potatoes, it was served over a date-potato salad.  We also had some fun cocktails, some sort of caramel custard-dessert and coffee.  We rolled out stuffed and had an absolutely amazing experience.  It's a little expensive but well worth the visit."}
{"text":"Very good customer service. It was unfortunate that our food came out late but the staff handled the issue so professionally. I would definitely recommend this place. I was impressed how well they handled the issue.   It was my first time in Ocotillo. The atmosphere is definitely lovely. Food is also good and reasonable."}
{"text":"I tried. I tried so hard.   I've been three times and each visit has been equally awful.   My boyfriend and I came for brunch when they first opened. I love love the layout of the three buildings and the outdoor seating however upon walking in, it's a little difficult to figure out where the entrance/host stand is, and servers running around don't stop to welcome you in or show you the way (I watched many couples and single people wandering around helplessly as even the managers passed them by).   Our server took about 10 minutes to greet us. We ordered coffee that came in Togo cups instead of ceramic? I ordered avocado toast which was actually really great. We also ordered the bread pudding which was not very bread pudding like. Wouldn't have been too terrible except that one of the managers spent about 20 minutes (no exaggeration) at the table next to us talking loudly about his wines and his travels and sounding ridiculously pretentious. My boyfriend and I could hardly converse with each other. That and our servers disappeared for long lengths of time without water refills, or checks.   The second time we came here for happy hour around 430pm and the bartender said they close at 5pm but the website said they were open for dinner... He also didn't offer to let us stay for the 30 minutes they were open. Guess he was ready to go home.   The third time I came to sit in the beer garden and work on my computer. They were out of three of the beers I asked for and the bartender didn't seem to know anything about the beers. He offered me a light beer after I said I liked stouts and porters.   I watched more people wander in and out of the establishment with no idea of where to enter the buildings. I'm just amazed at the lack of training.   I suggest more attentive staff, and either clear signage or staff to direct guests.   Overall, coffee was good. Food was ok. Service was pretty terrible."}
{"text":"I'm not one for envy. It is, after all, the least fun of the seven deadly sins, and coveting your neighbor's wife seems like a bad move (he's a lot bigger than me, and she's kind of busted anyway). But I must admit I turned a bit green at the sight of Ocotillo.  The food is good, and the service is better (shout out to my man Macalister), but it's the space that inspires the envy. It's gorgeous, and it could basically never exist in NYC. It's massive, with a coffee bar, a beautiful dining room, and this expansive patio with huge communal tables appropriately spaced, comfortable seating around a firepit, and more.   We were seated outside under some heatlamps (even though it was warmer than January has a right to be), and even if dinner wasn't delicious, drinks around the firepit seem like a great idea. But dinner was delicious.   I was lucky enough to share just about everything that came out, and there were very few misses. The hits I'd recommend:  The Ocotillo Chicken. I'm usually against ordering chicken, but almost always down to order something named after the house, and I'm happy I went with the latter impulse. Big flavors, perfectly executed, go for it.   The Cauliflower. Roasted, spiced, and zested, it was about as good as vegetables get.  The Duck Wings. I didn't see them on the menu, so I'm not sure if they were a special, but they were the best thing I ate all night."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!! Ryan was our server he was  informative and funny. I'm a vegetarian and sometimes find that when going out to eat I don't have many options. This place was great though.  The veggie cassolet was amazing, and the roasted cauliflower was perfection. Great ambiance and service! I will definitely be back to see Ryan!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here. The food was awesome, and I loved the decor. If you live in the area, great place to hang out."}
{"text":"Food is awesome but the service is not good. Our server seemed nice just...Inattentive. He never asked us if we wanted a second round of drinks or removed our empty glasses from the table. My dessert melted while I waited for my coffee."}
{"text":"Ocotillo has become our go-to spot for brunch in Phoenix. We have yet to have a negative thing to say about the place. First off the space is beautiful. Plenty of seating indoor or out and a sharp clean design. Service has been nothing but excellent and I'm not sure the kitchen isn't staffed by cyborgs considering the speed at which our food always arrives. Ocotillo is the PERFECT spot to grab a tasty bite and some bottomless mimosas to kick off your Sunday funday or if you're feeling a little more tame it's still just about the best breakfast food in town. You kind of owe it to yourself to check this spot out."}
{"text":"Ocotillo is freaking amazing! The food, the environment, and the service are all superb!   We shared a steak with grits and the skillet pancake that was on the brunch menu.  The steak was juicy and had a ton of flavor! The grits were so yummy that I could eat large bowls of just the grits!  The skillet pancake was huge and came out on a cast iron with good flavor and syrup that went perfect with it! I didn't use too much syrup though, just a little bit.   If you want a good place to eat, definitely check out Ocotillo! It is not a cheap restaurant, but i am sure you will enjoy it!"}
{"text":"This place...I cannot rave over it enough. Every time we come, I try something new and every time, I'm pleasantly surprised. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable about what's in your meal or cocktail. They're genuinely kind too, which means something to me. The brunch menu is priced quite modestly for such a posh environment. Lunch and dinner are just a few dollars more.   Recently I had the Japanese style Fish-n-Chips which was listed under \"small\" dishes. It was actually three giant pieces of perfectly breaded cod sat atop crispy fries which had crushed nori sprinkled on them. The dish also came with a cucumber slaw. It was anything but \"small\" but I'm not complaining because it was damn delicious. Definitely in the top 3 Fish-n-chips I have ever had. They also have really tasty coffee and you can order yourself a coconut if you're feeling squirrelly. Overall a fabulous place to spend an hour or two enjoying a perfect meal. Definitely take out-of-towners here to show off our amazing city."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been twice over the last few months and we cannot say enough good things about this exciting restaurant.  First, the restaurant itself is beautiful. Simple modern, open feel, just perfect.  Second, the service is the best. Best of the best wait staff with zero pretension.  David, one of the owners is always onsite, greets guests and has such a positive and infectious personality. Love this guy! Finally the food is wonderful. Locally sourced farm to table concept including several home made pasta dishes that are to die for. This is a place you don't want to pass up.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I Came in with some friends and started out at the bar , it was busy but the bartender bud took the time for us and recommended some great drinks and food for later, service at the bar was very prompt and friendly . We moved to a table and were served by Ryan who was very helpful with recommendations . Food and drinks were very good and Service was awesome ! We all had a great time and will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"This past Friday night was my first, but will not be my last visit.  It's very difficult to find a restaurant that has genuine service and exquisite cuisines.  Ocotillo has both.   The most memorable part of the experience, aside from the food, was the very customer centered service from Amber.  The one notable aspect of the meal experience was that they let me eat, in peace, without those utterly annoying constant checkups.  I highly recommend this location and know you will love it!!!!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh - the best pasta and meatballs ever? also had a great vegetable appetizer - grilled winter squash with lots of goodies. Dessert was another winner?The Resturant and grounds are just beautiful, modern and oh so smart. Great wait staff? Will be back again soon."}
{"text":"Trendy, open space inside and out. Corbin was our waiter at recent birthday lunch and he should get 5 stars for his service. Very knowledgeable, cheerful, attentive. A real professional. Food earned the 3 stars. Chicken chopped salad had variety of interesting ingredients but no flavor. Fish and chips nothing special. Menu sounds wonderful but food didn't make the mark. I've tried twice, will there be a 3rd?  Well, maybe just for Corbin's great service."}
{"text":"One word. Disappointed. I pass this place all the time so I decided to go for my first time today for my Birthday lunch.The place is cool but the food is meh. We ordered different things and they were meh so we agreed on 3 stars. To make matters worse my friend and I feel sick (if you know what I mean) So our rating went down to 2 Stars. I think I will skip this place for food and IF.... IF I go again I will just try the coffee bar or the bar."}
{"text":"This place brings something a little different. The menu is full of fun new dishes with interesting ingredients. The beer selection is good enough, and the outdoor space is awesome during the cooler months. The owner brings a great vibe and the staff is knowledgeable. Good find in midtown."}
{"text":"I would love to give this place 5 stars because the menu, food, and service were all 5 stars but the ambiance was more '60s' coffee shop' which is ok but not at dinner where the menu items and prices are pretty high end.  Not that I would complain about prices, they are in line with other restaurants with this quality of food but you don't feel like you are in a fine restaurant. From my table I could see the service area with the silverware, glasses etc, the lighting was overly bright and the decor is just plain,. I think they are going for the industrial chic look and it might work during the day but not for dinner.  The food however was fantastic and the dishes were huge. For those people who complain about high prices and not enough food on the plate, they will love this place.  We had 3 appetizers/salads for 5 big eaters and didn't finish everything (ok with me, I got the left overs to take home). The menu is extensive and creative, great wine list and cocktail menu. I think the prices are more in line with 3 or 4 $$ at least at dinner but well worth it.  Oh and the service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Fantastic spot for this time of year..warm January. Great food..brunch items to be exact. Great cocktails and beautiful outside space..parking to be a bit of a hassle but still easy if you take a breath.  Enjoy the fun space employees and f&b"}
{"text":"This restaurant has a amazing fish recipe. I love it. I'm here at least once a week. Sometimes I may share it most of the time it's too good any I keep it to myself. If you love fish, you may like this presentation and recipe."}
{"text":"Food is good (mango salad is yummy) but when the server tells you that they cannot do anything about the annoying flies... doesn't make you want to go back! Too bad because the place is cool and has potential!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic in all regards! Love this place, especially the Halibut ceviche."}
{"text":"Food was great, service was absolutely terrible and a 20% tip was added because we showed up 30 minutes after, to meet a group of people. As the server handed our check, he stated that gratuity was include. Just because we are with a large number of people does not mean you can provide terrible service knowing you'll get a 20% tip anyways! It took 15 minutes for someone to come greet us, and other 30 to get our drinks ordered and then another 20 to get our food ordered. The friend that we were with had get up multiple times to ask for things we need.   I'm just disappointed they thought they deserved a 20% tip   Currently talking to our Uber driver and he's saying he has been there several time and service sucks everytime."}
{"text":"Not one complaint. Not one!! Saturday morning and perfect indoor/outdoor seating for our group of ten ladies celebrating Galentine's Day. Excellent service, perfect beverage selection, and great food. We loved the smoked brisket, the chimichanga, the eggs & tortillas, the avocado toast, and the smoked beets. Wow - all so yummy. I loved that our waiter delivered a perfect beer-mosa for me, not everyone can do that just right. He never blinked an eye at our desire for split checks, even suggesting it from the start. I love that about a waiter and want to heap a better tip for his service. We ventured over to the coffee bar after for some chamomile tea and lattes - great service with friendly smiles and perfect beverages. I can't wait to come back!!!"}
{"text":"I didn't expect much, but I really liked their food and how they use the space.  My family was there around 5. It was too hot outside, so we dined indoor. But I think outside tables would be really nice when the weather is nice (meaning any month except July, August, September, and October). Plus, they know how to grill meat properly. Pork and chicken wings were perfect and more importantly, they were not salty (there is always a huge debate on why American foods are so salty among my friends and family members visiting the U.S. :P). I will come back for their chicken soon!"}
{"text":"Website states they are open until 11pm but kitchen closes at 3:40pm and there is no mention of this anywhere.  Can't order from the dinner menu, only \"small plates\" after this time until 5... bad advertising."}
{"text":"Love this place. Since it opened, it has only gotten better and better. My favorites are the falafel burger, Japanese fish and chips, all the vegetable plates, and their green tea (I don't know what it is, but it's delicious)!  Took my elderly parents and they loved it too even though they are not use to such ingredient driven menus."}
{"text":"Wow! The atmosphere is open, up scale without being stuffy. Clearly the focus is on the food and drinks. I had the kale salad.... Yes I know there is too much Kale in the world these days, but Ocotillo has done it right! Crunch just where you need it, substance, almonds for protein.... Yum yum yum. And the cocktails are classic and yummy."}
{"text":"Not sure where to begin here. Awful service, drinks and experience. The bloody Marys were like tomato juice and horseradish with no liquor. The GM says there was 12 ounces but I doubt it. The white sangria was watered down and awful. The fries were soggy and not cooked all the way.The service was even worse. Took 45 minutes to get drinks after waiving down a manager, waitress never asked how we wanted burgers and came out wrong. I know this place is new but nothing stood out that will make me come back."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner,  fantastic, the service was great, fun ambience,  the goid was delicious,  a great place for a date. The salads are huge,  a long with a dinner selection,  perfect for sharing over a bottle of wine. Looks lije an awesome place outside as soon as it cools down a bit. Yes I  Highly recommend this place two thumbs up"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good but service was too too slow.  We waited for our water, our drinks and our food order was mixed up and delayed to the pont where we wanted to send it back.  Pleasant waiter but bar was backed up so all delayed.  Inside was so noisy we moved outside.  Simply hire more staff !"}
{"text":"I had brunch here on a Saturday. I had the apple pie and it was delicious. I wasn't thrilled with the service but one of our waiters Mailei was really sweet. I heard great things about the food I was a little disappointed that there weren't a lot of familiar options to choose from and I was afraid to order something I didn't like. We had a great time though"}
{"text":"I guess I can start out with... The property is beautiful! Amazing design & concept. After seeing 2 employees while I walked up with a smile... I thought it funny that none of them made eye contact or greeted me with a hello. I went to Yelp to read if it was a common occurrence and from the look of it the service and employees don't have good reviews.   I came at 4:10pm, I called before hand to confirm I could order the Nutella iced coffee with boba... The fella who answered said I could order that in the restaurant even though the coffee bar closed at 2pm. Arrived & they were out of boba... So Nutella iced coffee it is. Great tasting, super bummed that they were out of boba!  Ordered my dinner to-go... Looking forward to the food, not looking forward to coming back to the cold customer service. I will note that the bartender was the only person to briefly communicate with me, she was nice... Other than that, I honestly felt as though the other employees attempted to not look up or make eye contact as I walked in, stood there alone and left. As a 30yr old, ex bartender/waitress/hostess, I've never seen so many unhappy employees. Kinda a weird vibe. Hope someone gives them an intervention of some sort on being more inviting and warmly seeing off their guests."}
{"text":"Love this place! I stay in the neighborhood, and it's a nice edition to the area. I purposely went in the morning when the coffee bar was open and enjoyed the open space courtyard area with not too many people there. It seems like the place gets a little more crowded than I'm interested in on Friday and Saturday nights. I guess that's what makes this place pretty awesome- it's a versatile space. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Loved the staff and the Sunday bottomless mimosas  ($18.00)... Downtown Phoenix  hipsters place...  they have early hours so arrive early. ... have an open bar area and sit down area.  I didn't eat I only had the mimosas and they were really bottomlessness endless!!"}
{"text":"I am a little bit obsessed with this place!  Super cool property, dj spinning music on the weekends at brunch, beautiful, fresh and fun eats.  I have been a handful of times for brunch and have tried quite a few things on the menu.  One of the servers suggested the brisket and polenta and it was fantastic.  Haven't had anything that I didn't enjoy.  Definitely a new favorite.  I am looking forward to date night and dinner soon.  :-)"}
{"text":"Exceeded my expectations.  Working in a kitchen has really ruined eating out for me in a lot of ways but mainly because I know what had to be done in most plates.. Well Ocotillo has seriously blown me away. The cocktail I had was excellently mixed, not too weak, not too strong, just right. Then there's the burger.... Amazing. A mixture of short rib, sirloin, and brisket in the patty with excellent caramelized onions and a fried egg on a brioche bun, i believe.   If you're looking for a new place to check out for breakfast, brunch, and lunch I highly recommend Ocotillo. Also, they will be open for dinner starting November 19th. I think I'm going, how about you?"}
{"text":"We have been here twice. The service is fantastic. The food is amazing. I can't imagine anyone saying anything negative about this place. The GM walks around and introduces himself. And makes sure you are satisfied with the food and service. Great place to chill. Support your locals!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, and great environment, inside and outside! I've watched a lot of new restaurants pop up around Phoenix over the years, and have been to a wide range of them... I think this is easily one of the best restaurants in the area. Everything I've had has been unique and delicious, and I've been several times for dinner and brunch (i love blue corn pancakes)."}
