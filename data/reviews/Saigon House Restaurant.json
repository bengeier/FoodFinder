{"text":"Not bad food here. service is usually very quick and food comes out hot and tasty.  I found the portion to be a little on the small size for pho dishes. the meat was very lacking. Soup needs more meat for a bowl of pho.  Parking lot is also always crazy because of the grocery store that's. prepare to battle for a spot.  Menu is decent with lots of selection. Otherwise not a bad a place to eat."}
{"text":"This is our \"neighbourhood\" pho joint (which in Brampton usually means getting in the car anyway.)  Even if it weren't, we'd still ake the trip--even though--because of their proximity to the Oceans grocery store--parking the car is sometimes challenging.  The pho is phantastic! I've had pho all over the GTA and this is probably the best--most delicately flavoured broth with lots of fresh bean sprouts and basil to accompany.  Other dishes I've tried are nearly as good--the green curry chicken is quite good as well as singapore noodles.... I'm fairly confident everything on the menu is just terrific.   Service is good too--way better than one usually finds in a pho joint.  Seriously--it's worth the trouble of finding a parking space to try the place. We'll probably be there too!"}
{"text":"I've only been here a handful of times since it's opened. No experience was out of the ordinary. Their pho is alright, nothing special.   On my last visit, I went to eat with my father. Decor looked exactly the same except dirtier. Booths were a bit run down. But they seem to have regulars who come there and I know the kind of rep they have, but nothing that particularly impressed me.   Just a few notes on service (because I am nit-picky): When we were served our pho, the server swung the bowl to put it down in front of my dad just to have the hot broth splash everywhere and barely missed his lap. Taken back by this, my dad and I looked at each other in distraught wondering what that all was? She clearly saw this but there was no apology. Secondly, after desperately trying to get the servers attention for the bill, she brought over a soaked check because she disregarded wiping her hands before adding up our bill. Maybe she was having a bad day? Which in turn put me in a bad mood.   Being put off by the service, I decided to save my breath about complaining and to never return. There are a lot of other pho restaurants in Brampton that would welcome my business."}
{"text":"Possibly one of the best pho broths I've had in Toronto and GTA. I hate going to Brampton because it is so far for me but my friend took me to this place and I am hooked. They also make an awesome pineapple shake. Pho is a super touchy and subjective food item, but this is an awesome place. Don't let the name or location turn you off."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the portions are large. Service is good and always done with a smile. The prices are great for the portions you receive."}
{"text":"The best Pho you can get.  And if you know me, I used to travel to the promised land to get Pho.  Since this place opened up back in 2007, I've come here on average once a week.  Calculate that til now, I've eaten there over 150 times!! The staff and owners know me (but not as Boo).  Why is this the best Pho?  Because they don't skimp out on meat.  Sure you've been to plenty of other Pho around town, but have you ever noticed that when you order XL, it's the same amount of meat as if you ordered a large with just a heck of lot more soup?  Ok, so I eat like a fat guy.  Just try this place and you'll know what I mean when compared to other Pho (88, 99, 111???)"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!! It's fast, it's hot, it's fresh, it's got a great atmosphere, it's cheap.   The only thing is I would warn new comers who aren't familiar with the style of ordering to tag along with more experienced people. It can be a little confusing or overwhelming when they just toss you the menu, pencil and order form lol"}
{"text":"Doing airport pick-up duty, plane got delayed and stomach wanted food, so we Yelped to find a good Vietnamese place near the airport. This one popped up atop the list.   Good Pho, flavourful broth without making you super thirsty afterward. A sign that the chef uses none or very little MSG.   Try to stick with the Vietnamese dishes, even though they offer Thai food as well, unless you like your Thai food to taste more Vietnamese than Thai.   A fairly large restaurant, minimally / plainly decorated as is the case in many ethnic Asian places. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"I gotta admit, I really enjoyed my first experience at Saigon House. I ordered the Rare Beef Pho with an order of Fried Wontons. For some reason, I got my pho before my wontons, which are appetizers, but not that big of a deal. The pho tasted great and I was happy to have gotten a reasonable amount of beef for a small and all my add on vegetables were fresh. Only thing that brought this from a 5 star to a 4 was seeing alot of bubbles in my broth; something reminiscent of oil in a sauce. I've had pho at plenty of other restaurants and I can say I have never seen that.   The wontons were crispy and delicious as the meat on the inside was nicely seasoned. The wonton shell had a sweetness to it that definitely added to the experience. I really wish I had more of these.   All and all, I walked away with a full belly for a reasonable price of $15. Definitely planning to try more from the menu to justify bumping them to 5 stars."}
{"text":"Excellent place for vaitnamese food.  Went with my boss yesterday and found it to be an amazing discovery.  Per head would be 10 dollars.  Staff was friendly and helpful.  You had to write order by your self.  Tried their prawns with noodles.  It's a must for some one who likes lite version of Thai and Chinese."}
{"text":"So I have been here before many times actually but never got the chance to rate or review them till today..  The appearance of the place has improved alot since the first time I came here they made the place seem much bigger.. oh forgot to mention they removed the cutlery on the table you only have sarachia and hoisin sauce. They give you few napkins and the spoon and fork or chip stick  But even if they have improved their appearance it really comes down to the service and quality if food..  We ordered 3 main dishes 1 appetizers 1 drink and 1 dessert 1.house special pho (Large)   So they don't have a size medium so if you plan on sharing with anyone I suggest getting the XLarge. The flavor of the broth was alright they forgot to give us the bean sprout till we asked after waiting a bit.   2.rice with grilled chicken fried egg and steamed egg   This is my son's favorite dish so we had to make sure it was good.. he ate all the chicken and the good thing is the chicken wasn't dry. I ate the steamed egg which I will be honest I have had better steamed egg. They over cooked the fried egg so we didn't get to use the egg yolk in the rice.   3.thick rice noodles (dry) with beef.   I always get this in any Pho restaurant and I can say the part I like with the way they made this dish is that they didn't go GREEN ONION crazy they added some BOK CHOY and sliced onion so I was very pleased that I didn't pick out chunks of green onion. Beef was a bit dry it hi k they could of used a better type of beef and it did lack flavor with the noodles. I'm not sure if I would order it again  Fresh shrimp and pork roll   This was very good I have no negative comment on it ingredients were fresh and the roll didn't fall apart and the dipping sauce was good they put alot of peanuts which I like.  Avocado shake   Didn't taste like avocado which was very disappointing to me it tasted like ice milk and sugar even though it had the avocado color it lacked the avocado flavor  3 bean with shaved ice and coconut milk   Not my cup of tea my man orderd this and I guess he enjoyed it I think it wasn't sweet so I can't see it as a desert. Comes with 3 types of beans and green jelly on the bottom.  **I feel that they change the appearance but the quality of food fell flat for me and they charge much higher then other pho places. It's nice to see it looks good but needs some work"}
{"text":"Its probably my second time coming here and i can say that ive never had PAD THAI taste this good in a viet restaurant as I do here. The portions are big and the quality is excellent. they also renovated the look of this place and it feels more relaxed and clean. my family also loved their food and were definitely choosing this location than any other in brampton. good quality, good portions!"}
{"text":"Another regular place in the work lunch rotation. There are 2 Saigon House's in the area and this one is in the same plaza as McDonald's and Kingsley. Another typical Pho restaurant and everything is very good and consistent. The beef broth is tasty, noodles slightly chewy, and portions are typical (eg. big). Lately I've been ordering the fried rice with beef ribs and shrimp. Fried rice is just average but the beef ribs are fantastic. Well cooked and not dry. The pork chop with fried egg with steamed rice is also good. Drip coffee and coconut milkshake are recommended. They recently renovated and the place now looks and feels a lot better. Solid place for a meal if you're in the area."}
{"text":"One of my  places, been coming here for several years now.  The food is reliably good, inexpensive, and the service is good.  Decor nothing o speak of, and located on outside of somewhat downmarket mall, but overall a great local eatery hat never disappoints me.  More than just Vietnamese, they also have Thai and Cambodian dishes."}
{"text":"Wanted to like this place but there are 3 serious problems  The Pho: decent flavour, clear broth, acceptable for sure in that regard. But it's the smallest portion for the money out of every Pho place I've ever been to.  Most Pho places give you a monster portion and bowl if you order a large, but not here  The spring rolls:  these have a very bizarre flavour to them and are probably among the worst I've had.  Best going to Pho Dau Bo and Pho Peter.  Pho Mi 99 has okay ones.  These are my least favourite though of the bunch.  They're using some kind of spice or veggie in them I just don't like at all.  Also quite greasy.   The drinks: this is the most frustrating aspect of all. I ordered a ginger ale with my Pho and when the bill arrived I couldn't believe these morons had the nerve to charge me $1.75 plus tax for a single can of pop!  This is just over the top in my opinion  Total bill, for one, for lunch:  $7 for the Pho $4 for the spring rolls $1.75 for a single can of pop  Most expensive and least satisfying Pho experience I've had in a long time.  Probably explains why the place was practically dead."}
{"text":"Love this place! I have only eaten Pho and spring rolls here but they are amazing! price is right too!"}
{"text":"Vietnamese cuisine brings fondness to my heart and stomach. The delicious, home cooked dishes, combines all flavors to my palette. Mixtures of spicy, sweet, sour, and salty within each bite epitomize authentic Vietnamese food. During my latest adventure, my perpetual hunger led my friends and me towards Saigon House.   Arriving in the midst of a cold, winter night, my friends and me were greeted by a waiter. We sat at a table booth. The décor was simple, as the floors and walls were covered with white tiles. The sauce and eating utensils were placed at the end of the table. The chairs were averagely comfortable. Despite the basic design, the focal point was the food.  Perusing the menu, I decided to order the Chicken Pad Thai. I seldom order Thai cuisine at a Vietnamese restaurant, yet I was compelled to branch into new flavors. My friends decided upon Bun Bo Hue and Pho.   Each dish arrived steaming hot. The Pho, to my surprise, arrived quickly. My friend said the pho was delicious. The noodles were perfect texture and consistency. The soup was brewed perfectly, infusing the noodles and beef.   The Bun Bo Hue arrived next and my friend quickly indulged in the spicy noodle soup. The noodles infused the flavors of the soup perfectly. The broth was brewed with perfect seasoning and spices.  The Chicken Pad Thai was disappointing. The sauce, which covered the noodles and chicken, was too sweet. Adding chili sauce balanced the flavors. The chicken itself was bland and did not infuse any flavors of the sauce.   My journey towards food greatness at Saigon House was disappointing. The Pad Thai, was too sweet, and lacked any innovation or creativity. Despite my disappointment, my overall rating is 4 out of 5 stars (my friends experience included in rating albeit less weight factor. And my past experiences were amazing). If hunger strikes, venture forth, and bestow your hunger with amazing food."}
{"text":"My go-to pho place. Always fresh food, always friendly staff. The best Vietnamese restaurant in Brampton. I highly recommend their pho soup, crispy chow mein noodle, and goi cuon."}
{"text":"The food is usually great but this time my food was terrible. My beef ribs were in a sauce and it does not state it in the description. Wasted my money."}
{"text":"Alright. Take out time. Food came on time. Decent price. An a good quantity for the price.   Tom yum soup. Too sweet, and had three or four thin slivers of chicken. All a liter of broth to fill up the container. The chicken / pork dumplings soup. Delicious dumplings and a nice broth. The pad Thai. Left much to be desired. Dry. Without a measure of the spices / taste you would be looking for.  Maybe I just got a batch.   Anyway. Maybe it will be a better experience another day."}
{"text":"One of the best in brampton. I work in brampton and there is nothing else better than this. Every friday, me and my colleges would go there and have lunch. Everytime it is great."}
{"text":"We stopped coming here for a few years because the quality of food has gone down terribly. We decided to go out of convenience and totally remembered why we stopped coming. It's really too bad. The ph is tasteless and the rest of the food isn't as fresh anymore. I like the service and workers here, so it's a real shame."}
{"text":"My mom loves this place! Good and decent amount of food plus nice service!"}
{"text":"I ordered via SkipTheDishes. I had fried chicken wings. It was nicely battered. Not my type of fried chicken. I'm thinking more seasoning would do the trick. I also ordered green curry Thai chicken, not my type. Maybe a little bit more curry would do the trick. However, the ration between chicken meat and vegetable is 1:1. The portion is appropriate to price. I'd order something again, try other dishes. In the end, I was full but not bloated. Thank you :)   The delivery was not picture worthy. Maybe I'll drop by in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Been to both locations. The food is fresh and well prepared. I've ordered the Basil Thai and a pork dish on two occasions, very tasty and not oily.  I ordered Pho for the 1st time for takeout. I got all these containers when I got home in addition to another dish. Like a novice I tried to put it together but didn't come out so well, no fault of the people who served it. Word to the wise, Pho should be ordered and eaten there.  Will be going back."}
