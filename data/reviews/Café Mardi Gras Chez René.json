{"text":"Ordered: 
-Fried okra, okay, not a fan of the corn batter. 
-Hushpuppies, not the best ever, grainy.
-Alligator sausage, couldn't taste that it was alligator whatsoever, it might as well have been pork. The dirty rice that came with it was over-cooked, grainy and under salted.
-Taster platter with jambalaya, creole shrimp & crawfish étouffée, the jambalaya wasn't bad but not great either..simple and on the bland side of things, the creole shrimp tasted like tomato paste and was severely under salted, the étouffée was pretty decent but the rice was very overcooked. 
-Bloody Mary's, affordable and comes with a tasty pickled okra but that's where the good ends. 

wtf?:
-Provided hot-sauces aren't hot..not even a little bit...actually nothing had spice, which is really disappointing for a Cajun/Creole place.
-The portions are small, and they're stingy with meats/seafood."}
{"text":"Nice casual \"down home\"style restaurant located on the seedier side of the village. We were a large group who were well-treated by staff and the owner/cook himself,who is as entertaining as he is educational. I learned a good bit about various spices, seasonings and mire pois, that are typically used in New Orleans style cooking. As for the food,this is more home cooking as opposed to gourmet.Very filling,( thank Goddess the waitress warned me), and the half portions of the various dishes will do,unless you're a big eater.  There is also a \"tasting\" dish of 4 entrees , should you just want a taste of different \"plats\". My half portion gumbo was tasty and \"stick to your ribs\",and my half portion of shrimp creole,was basically a couple of shrimp in Spanish rice. As I said,this is casual home style cooking as opposed to gourmet. All dishes are under $15.00 and even with a beer or cider,your bill will be under $25.00. Service very attentive,warm and informative.Wonderful spot for casual,friendly atmosphere dining."}
{"text":"Went here last night and it turned out to be their last in business.  This place is now officially closed.  It's a shame because while the service was off the food was actually pretty good."}
