{"text":"My husband and I ate here Monday night (12/23/2013) with our parents. The restaurant just opened 5 days prior.

We waited at the bar a bit longer than we expected but after we sat down the staff was very attentive.

The pizza bread and lobster mac-n-cheese was good. The steak sandwich was yummy but definitely needed about twice as much meat.

The owner came by and bought us a round of drinks which was appreciated given the wait for the table and food.

We recognize this is a new establishment and are confident the experience will be even better next time. 

Will we come again? You bet. They are new, looking for feedback, and open to hearing ways they can improve."}
{"text":"Very disappointed!!! Service was so bad we had to leave after an hour of still waiting for food. Not quite sure why this was since they were not that busy?!? The kids cup they gave my kids were dirty. Not sure how this could happen? Can't even comment on quality of food because we had to leave before it even came out!!! Won't be back unless I hear that changes are being made!!"}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday night with a party of six.  It looked like multiple tables were empty, but was told a 45 minute wait!?  We waited and had a drink at the bar.  Service was very slow and it looked like they had plenty of people working there?  Food was just average, even for bar food.  I realize they are new, but not sure I would go back."}
{"text":"We decided to give it a try--we were actually headed to Two Bucks but at the last minute thought we should at least give French Creek a try.  There were very few people in the restaurant which should have been a red flag.  I asked the waitress what she would recommend and she told me that the perch was really good.  Since I enjoy pearch, that is what I ordered.  I must say that of any perch dinner I have ordered, this was by far the worst I have ever been served.  There was very little fish and what there was, was overcooked.  I did not eat my dinner. When the waitress came to get our plates, I told her that it was a very bad meal.  She apologized, but that is it. We will never, ever try again, nor should you!"}
{"text":"I think they have since renamed the place, but we have tried the place twice in the last couple months.  Wings are okay, but everything else we tried was fair to say the least.  Way over priced from the lobster bisque to the wraps to the sandwiches.  We did give it a second chance, but won't be visiting again."}
{"text":"Chicken & waffles is probably the main reason to come here. Don't think fancy-schmance like something you'd find in Tremont, just think delish casual fare.

The dining area is somewhat bizzare, looks like they were trying to class it up but I actually like the rustic dark feel of the bar area better.

Limited menu available for bar seating.

Can't wait to check out the patio overlooking the creek in the summer.

And OMG, if you were familiar with this places previous iteration - Creekside - gone are the old cheese waffies, beer store, & shower curtain bathroom stall. It's not that place anymore."}
{"text":"Older, slow, waitresses. Food overpriced and not very good. Boneless chicken just had sauce drizzled over instead of fully coating! Really too bad, since its been nicely redone inside and a very nice patio. Will not be going back!"}
{"text":"This is a nice little local bar. It's clean and comfortable inside and they have a couple of nice pool tables.  I've been there a couple times and the food was good both times. The wings are only 35 cents on wing night! You can't find wings cheaper than that anywhere. they have a small selection of sauces, but overall are good. The burgers are worth trying too. Be careful of the liquor though! The prices on shots are quite high. 7 bucks for a shot of makers mark was a little steep, which was surprising since the rest of the process seemed very fair."}
{"text":"This is a typical bar with a nice patio view. Go for a drink because if you have any palate at all, you will be sorely disappointed. I had the grilled meatloaf, mac & cheese, and potato. The mac & cheese was good. The grilled meatloaf and potato were edible. It wasn't that great and I had the impression that much of their food is pre-made and reheated. My husband had the stuffed burger - definitely a frozen & reheated burger. The bun was nice and was tossed on the burner for a nice toast - but that isn't enough to save the burger. My husband also had a side of lobster bisque - not fresh and had a sour taste. My guess is that it was from a can or a bag & reconstituted. Overall, we just didn't care for the food, the music did not add to the ambience (Jimmy Buffett's Greatest Hits album), but the view and patio are very nice."}
{"text":"Visited here on a Saturday night, and the place was not very busy.  We were immediately seated on the patio out back, which is a nice place to have a couple drinks or enjoy a meal.  One thing I will note about the patio area is that I noticed a couple of people (regulars, I presume) smoking by the bar.  While this doesn't freak me out, it may cause a problem for some diners.  The good news is that it wasn't close to where most people were eating.

Atmosphere - like I said, a nice place to sit outside.  They had live music...not the best.  Pretty cheesy, actually, but it fit my mood that night.

Food - okay, but not great.  We tried the stuffed peppers (meh) and buffalo wings (good).  For my meal, I tried the \"Big Easy.\"  It wasn't bad, but it was pretty well-done by the time it had been fried (yes, a fried burger).  I would probably get it again.  The menu is pretty small, and some of the entrees are interesting to say the least.

Service - friendly, and the food came out of the kitchen fast enough.

Not sure that my wife will want to return, but it wasn't the worst dining experience I've had."}
{"text":"I give it three stars because it was okay, and I intend on going back, they have potential. 

Made a point of getting there while happy hour was still going on, because I like to get happy for cheap. Didn't get happy hour prices because it took them so long to make a f-u style bloody mary and shot of vodka. My partner liked the vodka suggested by the bartender. 

Service was off, but I've been a waitress and that could be for a myriad of reasons. Once we got their attention, all was well. 

Very nice ambiance with the patio, creek and live music, not to mention the good weather, but I can't fairly give them fair credit for that. 

The menu is impressive, not so much to be confusing and not the same garbage they serve everywhere else. I'm not much of a sandwich person, but I got the gyro, my partner a reuben. It's not a gyro shop so the gyro was just good. I don't think they can be done wrong. Lobster bisque was good, partner loved it, but he thinks Campbell soup and McDonalds is good. He totally loved his reuben. I had a few bites and it was good. The french fries were really good. 

I'm going back, and hopefully giving a better review next time. They have what it takes, they're just new. 

The building is 200 years old and I wish they could get that moldy smell out."}
{"text":"I came with a group of four last weekend and sat out on the new patio. The tables are the wrought iron mesh type, which aren't my favorite - everything wobbles and falls through on to your lap or feet. There was a nice view of the creek though. They seem to be having some technical difficulties that evening from some sort of power outage, and our waiter warned us that all the beers on tap were not quite cold. They also needed to update their food/drink menu - some items were literally crossed out by hand with a marker and at least two of the bottled beers I tried to order were not available.

Our waiter was attentive and friendly, and overall service was quick enough. He had no problem with us moving tables away from a speaker (they were playing some odd mix of techno-reggae?). I disagree with the previous comments about beer prices, $5 or $6 for a craft beer like Fathead's is pretty standard. As for the food, I thought they had some interesting choices (for a bar/restaurant in Avon) but overall everything was average in terms of flavor. My favorite items were the stuffed peppers and the side of veggies that came with my meal, which was chicken and waffles. The waffle is not a Belgian waffle as you might expect, but a soft waffle cone that contains the buffalo chicken (although there wasn't much buffalo flavor). It wasn't terrible, just seems like they might be trying too hard to be clever with this, instead of making a solid-tasting dish. My mom thought she was ordering something on the lighter side with the chicken and shrimp skewers over brown rice (she tried to nix the garlic bread), but it came out NOT on skewers and also covered with a thick, heavy sauce which wasn't included in the description. Our waiter tried to tell us it had already been taken off the skewers...but we could tell these were not grilled or skewered at all. My husband had a stuffed burger, which he enjoyed, so I guess if we go back I'll just go for a burger!"}
{"text":"So I ordered a draft Fat Head Head Hunter IPA and it was served warm and it was $4.00 during Happy Hour and that's with $2.00 off.  I ordered the stuffed BBQ burger on a pretzel bun and it was $11.  All I have to say if that the beer prices are WAY over priced.  The burger tasted great!  I'll be back if the beer prices come down.  The guy that was tendering the bar was awesome and he knew all of the beers that he had on tap and in the cooler off the top of his head."}
