{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite.  Nothing fancy.  Nothing special.  What you'd expect when you walk into a diner in Western PA.  Basic menu.  Can't touch the diners in NJ.

The owner was great and the waitress was cool  They close fairly early, so don't expect to stop in for a late bite."}
{"text":"Stay away from this place.  The service, food and atmosphere were terrible.  I sat at the bar for breakfast.  The service: The woman who served my meal (if you want to call it that) spilled my coffee.  While attempting to keep the coffee from spilling, her presumably clean thumb went into my cup... and she didn't apologize. The entire waitstaff was depressed and unfriendly..  I had to ask for OJ 3 times before it was brought to me.  When the OJ was delivered, the waitress made it seem like it was the worst thing anyone has ever asked for.  I think they are proud of their horrible service.  That's the only way I can make sanity out of it.  The food: The toast was plastered with butter and the bacon was served with an extra cup of grease.  I felt nauseous for hours after...The atmosphere: The place was hot and noisy.  I have no idea why it was busy.

Update after reading other reviews: it seems the place runs on a \"saucy\" attitude.  I think it's time to go back to the drawing board..."}
{"text":"We just finished a fabulous breakfast at Hot Metal Cafe. Food is hot with plentiful portions. Servers are cool. They tell you like it is. Have a little fun and see the humor. The place if clean and friendly. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"The Hot Metal Diner is the best diner in Pittsburgh! The food is fresh and delicious. You can tell everything is homemade. The omelets are amazing. And the homefries are to die for. The atmosphere is great, such a nice space and I loved all the sassy decorations. I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I was disappointment the moment we walked in. The staff was rude. The music was ridiculously loud! Somehow having to shout at each other doesn't seem breakfast appropriate.  They are ridiculously overpriced, with everything being an add on you have to pay for.  I can't say anything about the food, because we got up and left. After the negative experience with the staff and atmosphere, we didn't think it'd be likely that the food would be worth it."}
{"text":"Probably the worst reuben I've ever eaten.  And way, way over priced.  If you're gimmick is \"saucy\" attitude that's fine. But that shouldn't mean bad service like having to get up and track down a waitress to get cream for coffee or butter for pancakes.  The service was more lazy than saucy."}
{"text":"Just ok. Expensive for a diner. Been there about 6 times and that's been awhile. If you like over priced ok diner food then stop but there are a lot better places right down the road."}
{"text":"This place is great. Food is great and big portions that you probably cant finish. And the staff is hilarious singing and joking around with you I have to start going here more."}
{"text":"Grab a menu and seat yourself. I ordered the breakfast burrito, which was HUGE! I had to take half of it home with me.  However, for the price I paid I was expecting it to taste better. The coffee was okay, but not spectacular. Our server was clearly sick as well, which was a turn off. Not so sure I'll be returning."}
{"text":"We stopped by for a late breakfast and was disappointed.  HMD used to be one of our fav breakfast spots but it's gone down hill in both food quality and service. We ordered the Bobs fatboy sandwich and it was just ok..not much bacon.  The home fries were actually inedible..cold, stale, hard.  In fact, I asked our server if they could be taken off our bill. She grumbled but did. Not even a thank you from her when I paid the bill.  overall, it was just average."}
{"text":"I LOVE the Hot Metal Diner. My husband and I usually go on Sunday mornings when we're feeling extra hungry. They have so many delicious breakfast options on their menu. Yes, it does seem a little more expensive than typical \"diner prices\", but for all the food you are getting, and for how good it is, I believe its totally worth it.

Depending on how busy they are you may have to wait a little bit to put your order in/receive your food...but don't get anxious. It'll all be worth it once the food comes out! My favorite thing to order is \"Wendy's Favorite\", which includes eggs done how you want, sausage, bacon and a pancake. (The pancakes are enormous by the way). I like the combination of sweet and savory. But they have options for everyone! My husband is especially fond of the French toast made with Mancini's bread.

I've not yet tried any of their lunch options, but I definitely want to try them! The breakfast menu is just so great it's very hard to stray from even if you're there at lunch time!"}
{"text":"Portions are large and food is decent but service is slow and the one main waitress who has been there every time I have visited is as ALWAYS miserable.  She can be outright rude for no reason.  I understand they want to display \"sass\" but she is ridiculous.  If you are hungry and nearby, I'd recommend going but don't make a special trip."}
{"text":"I went a few weeks ago and was a bit disappointed. I didn't get \"it\" - the gimmick that they were trying to pull off. Our waitress was rather rude at the beginning of the meal, but her attitude wore off after a bit. The way the diner was decorated was kind of neat and I thought it had a decent selection of menu items for a diner. The portions are very large. I thought my meal was fine - the Texas toast was the best."}
{"text":"Got take-out lunch from this diner. Portions are generous, the food is good standard diner fare. Prices seem very reasonable - good place to go if you want some diner food and are in the area."}
{"text":"Brought people here while on a business trip in the area.  We all had burgers, fries and pop.  Service was excellent and the restaurant was very clean.  

It was nice to get away from the training sessions for a while and have a good old fashioned American burger meal.

If I was in the area, I would come back.  Reasonable prices for a decent lunch."}
{"text":"Just OK.   Had the standard breakfast. They were pretty busy and only one person running the whole place. Back area roped off. Wait person. Quite the treat. a mix of Flo And a truck driver. Pretty much told me what to order.  Food ok. Best was the bread. Potatoes cubed frozen. Not a place I would go to again. But not my choice today.  Nothing special."}
{"text":"The food isn't terrible, it won't blow your mind either. This place could easily be given a 3 Star review, but their management is terrible. Recently, I had a friend give them an honest, completely warranted negative review on their FaceBook page and he was asked to leave the next time he went to the restaurant for it. What kind of High School, cry baby, oversensitive crap is that? I suggest taking your money elsewhere to avoid anyone's feelings getting hurt."}
{"text":"Terrible service and mediocre food.  Waited over an hour on a not very busy day for 3 simple meals.   We didn't ask for anything but our waitress could tell we were upset and agreed the kitchen messed up.  She asked the owner to comp one of our meals.   We heard her response which was that she won't @$!#* give away free food just because we waited a little bit.   We won't be back!!!!"}
{"text":"This place isn't what it's cracked up to be. Slow service. Not tip top on \"clean\". Foods was straight bad I had warmer ice cream an waited for over an hour for the worst breakfast I had In my life"}
{"text":"I wanted to love the Hot Metal Diner because my friend raves about it.  I am hoping I came on a bad day and when I go back it will blow me away.  But I only have my one dining experience to go by and my review is based on that.
The coffee was awful.  This alone caused me to reduce my review one star.  Come on!  A diner HAS to have good coffee.  It was weak, lukewarm, and just not good.  
Service was slow.  Real slow.  And while my waitress was very nice, she took quite a while to come by and refill drinks, bring condiments, and overall bring our food.  If you needed butter, syrup, ketchup, good luck - you were going to have to wait.  
My omelet wasn't bad.  It just took a long time to get to me and was served with really bad coffee.
I'm going to try this place again because I can see the potential.  But right now I'm just not that impressed."}
{"text":"Reading old reviews validates our horrible experience at this understaffed and poorly managed establishment. We had a party of 6 and had to wait 10 minutes for our waitress to clean the table that we were told to choose ourselves. This place was staffed by two waitresses and a couple of cooks and housed about 20+ tables. People kept pouring in. It took us almost two hours from the time we sat down to the time we made it out. The 1 star was for the food portions- taste was mediocre at best. The menu said cash preferred but she refused to take credit card. The waitress was flustered and overwhelmed with her workload but still rude to us. My bill finally came and she was given cash. She came back without the difference and assumed it was hers to keep (for tip). I would not recommend this place to a person dying of hunger because they'd literally drop dead waiting for their meal to come an hour later. This place has potential if it were properly equipped with a friendly, welcoming staff."}
{"text":"No nonsense diner. You grab your own menu & you seat yourself. Food was just OK. I got steak and eggs essentially and I believe the steak was baked versus fried. It was super black, but tasted ok."}
{"text":"We have passed this place for years and finally stopped... I'm glad that we did... The menu has a large selection... Everything is reasonably priced... Service was good... My burger was huge and very tasty... If I had to correct one thing, it would be the cleanliness of this facility..."}
{"text":"This place is great!  All of the food is good and it's a unique experience.  Grab your own menu, seat yourself, the people are friendly, it's clean, and today they even have a breakfast DJ!  I love it."}
{"text":"First time at the diner and was very pleased with the menu  choices and the food was very good.  Way toooo much but we were warned in advance by  our waitress, who did a great job.  I can't wait to spread the news to all of our friends and family.  I ordered the buritto and it was enough for 3 men and a boy, so my husband is looking forward to breakfast the next few days ."}
{"text":"How about catching up with the times?!?! If you aren't going to accept credit cards, have your ATM work. It blows my mind that in 2014 there is a business out there that doesn't accept plastic."}
{"text":"Really? I can understand some Yelpers who are WAAAAAAY too serious when it comes to food, their food blogs, their desire to be heard. This is a D-I-N-E-R, it doesn't look like a five star, James Beard Award Winning, internationally known dining destination. it doesn't claim to be a restaurant where the pope will dine with other heads of state, it's simply a diner. With that out of the way, the food's okay, I enjoyed a little abuse from a waitress who knows her job, she knows how to treat her customers, and she's working for 2.01 an hour plus tips, give her a break!

I was hungry the morning I went in, I was hoping they'd have something I could eat. I had the 5 egg white omelette with tomato, onions and peppers. I asked nicely if she could NOT bring me toast, in it's stead, I asked for an order of the Italian French toast, no butter. My father made Italian French toast for us growing up. His secret was a little almond extract in the batter, and in the maple syrup. Delicious!

Back to the Hot Metal Diner, the omelette and French toast arrived. The omelette was just as I expected, tasty, nothing special, just some protein and vegetables for my body. But the French toast was good, I believe I tasted a touch of vanilla. The texture was crispy and chewy, just like dad's. the coffee was good, sort of had that donut shop brand flavor. All in all it was a good breakfast, I got what I expected. A decent meal for a fair price. I wasn't expecting finger bowls, waiters filling my water glass after every sip, or valet parking. It's a diner."}
{"text":"Lunch comes with chips. I was called cheap for not ordering fries. I do not think this is how a customer should be treated. The food wasn't memorable either. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Love this place.  The food for breakfast is just awesome.  Planning a ride from D.C. to the burgh and will bring the motorcycle gents to this location for some eats!  Bacon was great and the sausage even better but I do say the pancakes...you can't eat just one.  In fact its so big you can't eat a whole one!  Awesome stuff and thank you!"}
{"text":"I consider myself a asshole so this place just feels right too me.  its got that trucker vibe going on inside, good food good coffee and interesting people who work there.  dont be surprised if you waiter keeps it a little to real.  like I said its like a truckers dinner so expect a little attitude from the waitress."}
{"text":"Barely average food and lots of barely average food...which you won't finish because it is barely average not because there's so much.  Very disappointed in both the food and the rude staff. Not worth going out of your way."}
{"text":"Nice diner atmosphere; great diner food. Not sure why people have harshed on the place - we had a great breakfast here in the middle of the afternoon, and felt that the staff were friendly and attentive to our needs. Food came out fast, and wasn't the typical grease pit fare. Sure, there's a little extra butter on the toast, but isn't that why you are at a diner and not at home?"}
{"text":"This is the best diner that I have ever eaten at!  They don't skimp on quality or quantity of food. My husbAnd had the BLT and unlike most restaurants, the focus was on the \"B\"-BACON. It is thick cut and a generous amount. I had the Hog which is eggs, bacon, specially seasoned potatoes, and toast. One if the things Pittsburgers lover is Italian bread. So Hot Metal's toast is thick sliced Italian bread. You need that type of toast to stand up against the rest of the food on the plate. All of the food is fresh. You can't go wrong. 
The wait staff knows their stuff. Most of them have been at this for years. They joke around but with a straight face so it leaves you wondering if they were actually joking. The owner Mary is a character. You might find her asking you to dance or see her driving a remote control car or robot to entertain small children. 
Just remember to bring cash!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has sadly gone downhill. Today we actually never even got our food. We waited over an hour and left. The table next to us waited 2 hours for their food, then when it finally came, they messed up their order. The waitress was not very friendly to them. Our waitress complained to us that they were mad. Another waitress walked by complaining about a customer. I understand places get busy, but this was ridiculous and not even crazy busy. We will not return."}
{"text":"Note #1: Due to my compliance with the restaurant's bylaws, which forbid the use of cellular phones, I did not snap any pictures of the food or the diner's eclectic decor. 

Note #2: CASH ONLY!! An ATM sits near the entrance for your convenience. 

During an instance of vacation day hooky, Kay and I needed to go to the West Mifflin Wal-Mart (*groan*), but the lady was strongly craving a no-frills diner breakfast. That's when I remembered the controversial Hot Metal Diner, a local chuck wagon that has become a suburban institution of sorts. 

Fittingly located in a shopping plaza across the road from a Harley-Davidson dealership, Hot Metal Diner can be a crass, unpleasant experience for those who refuse to follow the posted guidelines OR take themselves too seriously. Having addressed that, the demeanor of the servers was not something we had  problems with. If anything, our server in particular was a model of politeness and efficiency. 

I did have a minor gripe about some of the signs that were on the walls until I recalled that the restaurant proudly proclaims itself to be a \"kid-unfriendly\" place as per a sticker on the front door. I'm not sure how I feel about that, but a youngster was dining with his mother behind us, and if she wasn't offended...

'Tis a minor shame since I know my inner child was wide-eyed and smiling upon seeing the giant rooster that sits in the middle of the house as well as those colossal barber shears mounted near the front door. There's quite a bit of amusing wall candy to peep at while you're awaiting breakfast or lunch, speaking of which...

The Breakfast Soft Tacos (2 to an order) were not the least bit duff. The white tortillas are unassumingly filled with fluffy yellow clouds of scrambled egg and shredded cheddar. Meat costs a buck extra, so I asked for bacon in one and sweet sausage in another. Ulp! A special request!

\"Eh, we don't do that here, baldy,\" our waitress said with grin and a wink only to honor my customization on the sly. 

Soft, cheesy, ooey, gooey, and as warm as mid-afternoon in August, each parcel of protein and dairy got me fueled up but good.

Hot Metal Diner doesn't do desserts, unless yinz wanna count their Grilled Cinnamon Roll. Flaky as a croissant and iced like a donut, this utility hole cover of a pastry was smeared with a dab of half-melted butter, and man, did it quiet my squeaky sweet tooth. 

Tattooed welders and portly truckers looked on curiously and chortled good-naturedly as I finished Kay's excellent placemat-sized pancake and heap of textbook-crisp corned beef for her. 

\"Damn, you sure can eat, kid!\" One middle-aged fella said to me. \"You work around here? I never seen ya before.\"

\"Nah, I'm a South Hills guy, but I work in the East End. We both laid off today,\" I replied. 

\"Ha, ha! Don't get in no trouble,\" he advised as he nodded and left the premises. 

A veteran of the restaurant wars, owner Wendy Betten is your unapologetic, smart-aleck, potty-mouthed aunt who loves ya dearly. She'll tease ya about your hair (or lack thereof in my case) yet will knock anyone who badmouths ya over the head with a rollin' pin. And as long as your skin is elephant-thick and your sense of humor is hearty, you're welcome to grab a seat and a bite to eat anytime she's open.  

P.S. On Sundays from 10AM to 1PM, HMD features live music! No kiddin'!

P.P.S. Rick Sebak, a much-acclaimed local documentarian, once filmed a memorable piece on Hot Metal Diner for WQED, Pittsburgh's public television affiliate...

{"text":"The price is high for diner food in Southwestern PA, but the quality isn't any higher, nor are the portions larger.  They're across from the Harley Davidson dealership by Allegheny County Airport.

The gimmick of the restaurant would be the \"saucy\" attitude of the wait staff.  Problem is, I don't enjoy the gimmick; if the staff is jokingly rude but never lets up, and the food is the same quality/portions as other places I'd go, but the prices are slightly higher...

Dunno.  My immediate takeaway was \"if I was trying to feel younger and bought a Harley for that reason, I imagine this is one of the places I'd wind up eating on a semi-regular basis.\"

2-stars.  There wasn't anything wrong with the food, and I'd probably eat there again if someone asked me to meet them there, if they were really set on it."}
{"text":"The Hot Metal Diner is a little diner named for the hot metal on a motorcycle. The owner has set-up her \"joint\" exactly the way she wants it complete with gobs of attitude. 

The menu is common for a diner/cafe in the Pittsburgh region. The portions are enormous ensuring that you don't leave hungry. The food is average and priced to match. The inside is open and the \"help\" is attentive.

Stop in if you're bored and want to try a new place."}
{"text":"I understand their schtick is to be rude and obnoxious to customers, but that only works if the food backs it up. Unfortunately, the food is mediocre at best. Just your traditional and somewhat generic breakfast/lunch staples. Basically, anyone can make this stuff in the comforts of their own home without the off-putting treatment."}
{"text":"Yes, \"typical\" diner food, but isn't that why you go to a diner?!?!  

The staff is fun.  Yes, I can see where some people may be put off by the \"saucy\" attitude, but if you have a sense of humor and are in the mood for a bit of fun along with some quite decent, well prepared food-- go!

I had a single (huge) buttermilk pancake (with chocolate chips) and it was tender and very good.  My husband ordered the Hot Metal Mixed Grill (eggs, potatoes, green peppers and onions) and he loved it-- said that it was very flavorful and not at all greasy.  

We don't go out to eat very much (I love to cook), and are quite particular about where we do eat, but we plan to return to the Hot Metal Diner soon."}
{"text":"Went here after a long night of drinking at the McKeesport marina. The breakfast food is on point, the women working that morning had the most smart assed sense of humors ever and treated our table of 12 drunks as deserved. They forgot the pickle for my one friends food and after he whined about it they brought him a whole jar of pickles and told him to eat them all.....I think he ate half of them. Anyways the food here is light years ahead of Denny's and its a good atmosphere. I see a lot of the Bad reviews here mention \"what else do u expect from western pa\" so..... They must be from Cleveland or Baltimore.....this isn't a gourmet bistro, it's a breakfast food joint. And i honestly wish I had one like it here in the dc area.
