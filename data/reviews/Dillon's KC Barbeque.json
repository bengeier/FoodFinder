{"text":"Delicious food. Great service. Our waitress checked on us regularly to see if we needed anything. Fernando, the manager also stopped by our table to ask if we needed anything and to make sure the food was to our liking. A really great neighborhood restaurant and sports bar!"}
{"text":"Great food and variable service. I hate onion rings, but love theirs! My favorite is their pulled chicken sandwich. My husband loves their BBQ brisket sandwich. Friendly staff, but slow on the upkeep."}
{"text":"If you are a BBQ restaurant selling nachos, and the nachos don't have BBQ on them, I think you should take a long look in the mirror and think about your life choices. Still, this place has pretty good food and a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"I love their pulled pork sandwich with sweet heat barbecue sauce. To be honest, it's basically what I always get here. I've also tried their baby back ribs and chili and loved those as well. My favorite sides are the beans and the mac and cheese. 

I've been to their Arrowhead, Thunderbird, and Grand locations and have found the service and food to be consistently great."}
{"text":"I have been to Dillon's several times and do love the people.  The food seems to be good in general.  I did order the Chicken tortilla soup instead of BBQ.  One thing about this soup is TORTILLA'S   and there is not a one. ???

Also the music in the bar is not right with BBQ....needs some country.  Not some soft rock and i heard Boy George today.  BBQ is country and there needs to be some country music."}
{"text":"I always pick up a Groupon when available. They also take AAA discount. The onion rings keep me coming back. I love them with hot sauce. Huge portions and kid friendly. Great place to relax"}
{"text":"I have to say, same great food as the other location, but slightly better service. 
Went with the Pulled Pork Sandwich again and it didn't disappoint. One small difference; They put the slaw on top of the sandwich!  Fries were very good as well. One day I will try some of their regular entrees instead of the sandwich. If you're craving BBQ Meat goodies, and are in the area, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Service great.  NFL Sunday, didn't play for respect for Veterans,  please, we all respect them.  NFL , not what it is about.  Equality, simple as that.,
Owner, shame on you.
Education for all.  Was pretty empty in the restaurant and bar."}
{"text":"I'm very disappointed in the rapid, noticeable decline in quality exhibited by Dillons--especially The Arrowhead location--over the last several years.  It used to be my favorite BBQ place in town.  In fact, I used to do seminars at its Sun City Grand location.  Now it is just an overpriced, average BBQ place.  It looks like the bar became more important to the ownership than the food.  Don't do take out or you will leave feeling ripped off.  You pay by the pound depending on the protein you choose.  We paid a premium price for 2.5 lbs of meat and got about 1lb of meat scraps soaking in a plastic container filled with water.  Pretty expensive water!  I didn't recall ordering soup.  When I pointed it out to the worker, she went to the kitchen drained the water, but did not add any meat to the containers.  Do they think customers are stupid?  The worker ignored me when I complained and simply changed the subject.  I will not be going to Dillons again. Buy a couple of nice steaks at Costco or your local supermarket, you will get more and better quality meat for half the price!"}
{"text":"I really want to give more stars but I believe A-OK is the perfect description for Dillons.  We have been to some of the other locations and they are all A-OK. 

 Draft selection 2 stars.  Wine Selection 2 stars.  Food is between 2 and 4 any given time.  Fried pickles are good.  Service is great at the bar.  Wings on hh make no sense as it is better to order off regular menu.......mmm very crafty Dillon.  We have had the ribs which were good once and tough the other time.  Had a pulled pork sandwich with slaw on it that tasted like a salt lick.

We will be back for some domestic beers and fried pickles at happy hour."}
{"text":"The Pulled Pork sandwich was so awesome... The server was on point and attentive.  Our drinks arrived fast and so did our food... The restaurant is quiet and perfect for a date night... We came without the kids but it looks kid friendly... Good prices on food... We will be back... This place has a very good vibe"}
{"text":"Best food around!  Love this place and enjoy the atmosphere.  Friday nights are nice to listen to live music, however extremely busy.  Can't find a seat and most are open because of people dancing but still keeping their seat.  Went there last night and waited for a table to open up.  Once did told we could not sit there, finally were able to and waitress wouldn't acknoweldge us for over 20 minutes.  Called to let manager know and was very apolgoetic however did not offer incentive for us to come back.  After not being acknoweldged and not getting any dinner, drinks, etc no incentive to go back and experience that again.  Stick to restaurant side if you go and you will enjoy the food immensely."}
{"text":"Food was terrible. Restaurant seemed to be big for happy hour as that area was packed. The dinning area we were in was old and dumpy looking. Food was ready within 5 minutes of ordering and tasted like it was reheated. Will not eat here again. Sad we wasted a night out here and money. Was not worth it. Worse than ramen noodles."}
{"text":"The meal is OK. But I personally prefer another bbq (83rd ave)The sauce was not good at all here at Dillons. Now I know. Atmosphere was not my preference either. Will definitely be going back to other BBQ place. Server told us bread will be fresh out of oven in a minute, but they never brought it. Oh well,  live and learn."}
{"text":"Boot management, great food,cold beer, otherwise management doesn't know their arse from their elbow.....got told a discount vault card would be honored then as I was paying they changed their mind because they weren't sure on their own policy.......boot status....sorry passport card is only good on dining in after I asked 45 mins ago but the manager said he would \"take care of it until the GM got back to him\" ........lolllll never again greedy folk."}
{"text":"We originally tried Dillon's with a Groupon.  I have been disappointed with most BBQ places in the Phoenix area so had no expectations.  We started with the fried pickles and they were the best I've ever had.  We were pleasantly surprised with our meals and have been back 3 more times.  They have delicious pulled chicken, ribs, and the Arizona turkey sandwich is yummy.  My only recommendation would be to have bottles of the different sauces on the table, but the staff are all super friendly and willing to bring you whatever sauces you want and as much as you want.  Even the bussers are super attentive and nice.  I actually can't say enough about my experiences here and the food is all delicious!  There are also tons of TVs all over the bar and restaurant so a great place to watch sports!"}
{"text":"Great food service has never been quite as great as the other chains. irritated tonight that I called an order for pick up and then drove in around the time they said it would approximately be ready asked the host when I got to the there if my pick up order was ready and she said no not yet so I sat and waited for at least 15 minutes went back up there to find out that she didn't even have a pick up order for me. Its my fault for wrong location but Would of been. ice to know before I sat and waited so long. I could see maybe if there was anybody else waiting for a pick up order but it was just lonely old me sitting there"}
{"text":"So SO good! Everything here is AWESOME. Delicious pulled pork, pulled chicken, burgurs and the $2 onion rings are to die for. They don't take reservations which was weird but whatever it's worth the wait, I promise! I've been there 3x now and have not been let down. My last waiter was names Joshua and he was THE BEST!!! Never an empty glass on the table and he was very quick to pick up what extras you needed. Loved him!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten here a few times. Ususally like to eat at pub tables and get their chili or burnt ends (which is their signature dish). Beans are good as well. Ate there today for a busines lunch and I was dissapointed with the burnt ends. A bit chewy today. An associate also had them (last two orders left) and he agreed.  However first time they were sub-par, so hopefully just a glitch. Will be back again."}
{"text":"I'm from TX & I love their BBQ! I'm not a big fan of the location, I find it dark & too much of a sports bar feel, so we always get it to go.  We get it a lot for catering to party groups & it always goes well.  The beans are our favorite!! But my husband loves the pulled pork & I love their brisket & turkey when I want to be healthier"}
{"text":"Ask for Kari 's table when you get there . She always takes really good care of me and my friends"}
{"text":"Server was amazing.  Friendly, attentive and helpful.  Wish I remember her name because she was a gem.  That's why it gets 3 stars and not 1.

Sadly, the food at best was forgettable but mostly just kinda gross.  Reminded me of nursing home food.  Don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Been eating here for years. Love it. This is BBQ like back home in Missouri.
Love the baby back ribs with cajun sauce. Drinks are always priced well, service is usually good. Gotta love the fried pickels too! ;)

Its a homey feel of a place and this is great BBQ! Oter locations are just as good."}
{"text":"First time here. Good food. Good service. Will be back. 
Recommend the onion rings & pulled pork."}
{"text":"I was very excited when I first walked through the doors of Dillon's. The energy seemed in excess and the atmosphere was just so lively. It was hard not to get excited! With patrons enjoying food and drink all around us, I was very much looking forward to my dining experience here.

We ended up sitting at the bar so we can watch the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics (which was dec). Service was very attentive and good despite the heavy crowds that night. 

The food itself however was pretty badtastic. I ordered the baby back ribs which is kind of what they're supposed to be known for. While the meat was very lean, it wasn't very flavorful. Even worse, I struggled with trying to get the meat to fall off the bone cleanly. And when meat doesn't cleanly fall off the bone, that is a sign of ribs done wrong. 

I'm willing to give Dillon's a 2nd shot and try their brisket or something else. But their baby back ribs were a big disappointment and I'd stay away from those."}
{"text":"Would love to tell you what I thought of the food but didn't bother waiting around long enough to see. Several \"smaller\" groups were seated ahead of us, (we had 7 the other groups had 4-5), not a big problem however when we were seated we then waited over 15 minutes for a waiter or waitress to come take our drink order. The final straw was when a group of the exact same size was seated right next to us and a waiter showed up within 2 or 3 minutes. 

I complained to the manager and she told me that she was sorry but that if I was that upset I should just leave. I took her advice."}
{"text":"I love the BBQ and the fish tacos!  The staff is always polite and professional and attentive to diner needs.  Any place that keeps my daughter happy always is a plus!"}
{"text":"Our food is always good and the staff is nice, especially in the bar. The only down fall is that it can be a long wait to get seated."}
{"text":"I was there a few days ago with a large group. We had a huge table and no problems getting seated. Our server was great. She was over to the table quickly after new people arrived.  She was funny and very friendly. From service standpoint this place is great!

We all shared apps. Wings were good...poppers were great. The spin dip was Amazing! 

I do not recommend the smoked salmon. It was very dry. Everyone else enjoyed their meals though. I would go back and try the ribs...they looked great!"}
{"text":"The beef ribs were a dissappointment. Great customer service though."}
{"text":"This is a mainly a review of the bar.  Food secondary as I drink here much more than I eat.

First off, happy hour is good and lasts until 7.  Good for us folk on the west side who can't make it back from our jobs in the big city until 6.

Beer selection is ok.  A few of the typical on tap and always something nice on the \"guest\" tap.  I do have to say that the bar tenders are pretty tight on their pours of the hard stuff.   Because of this I pretty much stick to beer at Dillon's.

The bar is comfortable with a ton of TV.  Many are new, nice, flat screens.  Problem (BIG) is that they are not connected to HD.  What???  

Oh how I would love to watch NFL there.  Fix the HD issue and you'll definitly have several more customers on Sundays.

The BBQ is darn good.  I do my own so am pretty picky.  This also means a very rarely order it.  They do a great chicken fried steak (and chicken).  Fries are good.  Gravy, both white and brown are good.

This location is undergoing a big changing of the guard right now with two of their long time bartenders 5 months pregnant.  The new girls definitely need some work but hopefully Carl, the very affable manager (did you try the velvet hammer yet?), will get them in line.  I'll give it some time.

The best thing that keeps me coming back are the bar specials.  They are good all the time, as long as you are in the bar.

They have a small order of onion rings for ONE DOLLAR.  The onion rings are fantastic to boot.  They also have Potato Peels for ONE DOLLAR.  This is essentially are just what they say they are, the peels of the potatoes they use for their mashed potatoes.  Most are pretty thick and they give you a great portion.  Like thick potatoe ships, kinda."}
{"text":"The ribs were excellent. The bloody Mary was average. Love the sweet hot bbq sauce."}
{"text":"When I arrived at Dillon's I had high expectations. The exterior of the restaurant looked great and there was a nice little waterfall by the entrance. I was expecting some high quality BBQ, but sadly I was a little let down.

The food wasn't the worst thing I have ever had, but to be honest everybody in my party thought it was pretty gross. The best thing we ordered was the appetizer and it was all downhill from there. I knew it was bad, because nobody in my party elected to take a box home (and we almost always take leftovers back) even though all of us had only eaten about half of our plates.

So I have to confess that I'm not a fan of the food here. Maybe it's just Kansas City style food that I don't like as this is really my only experience having that type of BBQ. At least the wait staff was nice!"}
{"text":"Food is decent.  I wouldn't say it is excellent.  We like going for Happy hour before hitting the movie or something.  We usually get onion rings (the best in town) and a few beers and leave for less than $10.  I am not a fan of their bbq.  They do have some great salads though, but tend to be a little $$$.  We visit every now and then but not one of our top spots.  Service does tend to be slow at this location and the Sun City West one. Not sure why-they seem to have enough workers."}
{"text":"Groupon had a $30 for $18 special so we decided to go here for lunch, It's been around a year since I've  been to one of the Dillion's restaurants. I always seem to get the smoked turkey because it is consistently good, as it was once again. This time I got the turkey club this time and it was very good. This Is one of the best values in town ( especially with the groupon) because I was to full to eat dinner and not hungry for breakfast either, so it was good for three meals! haha. Everybody else got some kind of BBQ beef or brisket with no complaints. Our server was nice and got everything correct. I Probably won't wait as long to eat here again."}
{"text":"I'd give them a 5, but have to take off for the outdated decor. Food is great, but the hunter green walls alone scream \"Update me!\" 

Went there Friday for the first time. I'm not a big BBQ fan, but my husband saw Burnt Ends on the menu and hasn't had them for a really long time, so we gave it a shot. I had the pulled pork with the mild sauce and was pleasantly surprised. He sampled the Burnt Ends, ribs and pulled pork with the Cajun sauce. Ribs were just okay; nothing to write home about. Mashed potatoes and brown gravy were really good, and so were the other two entrees he had. Good variety, two side dishes with your entree, and they even brought us samples of the sauces to taste before we ordered. 

Warning to kids: it's real Mac and cheese, baked with Parmesan and bread crumbs on top. My daughter thought it looked to foreign to eat, but we thought it was very tasty. 

The brownie sundae was good, not great. Brownie definitely tasted store bought. 

We'll go again - maybe to another location. Definitely felt more like Sun City than Arrowhead."}
{"text":"We live close by and enjoy visiting Dillon's.  The food is really great.  We usually order the crispy chicken wings for an appitizer as they come with the hot sauce on the side so I can add as much or as little as I want. Everything we have had so far on the menu we have liked very much.  Now that I have discussed the food let me tell you about the server that we have had the last three times we have gone in. We actually dined there just a few hours ago and I had to come home and write this review after receiving stellar service for the third time in a row.  His name is Josh.  He is the BEST server I have ever had in ANY establishment.  I used to work in the industry (back in the day) so I am very picky about service. (Drives my husband nuts)  Let me tell you, he is so friendly and on top of everything.  He goes above and beyond the call of duty every single time. He takes the time to explain things to you, offers you anything additional to make your meal perfect and checks on you at the perfect time, every time!  From now on each time we go there I will demand to be seated in his section.  If his section is full I would gladly wait for a table to open up.  He makes the dining experience so much better.  A+++"}
{"text":"Dillon's on 59th never disappoints! The staff is always super nice and goes above/beyond. The service is quick and our order is always correct! The food is super tasty and the BBQ sauces are awesome! There is live music on the weekends and the bar is always fun! If you haven't been, you're definitely missing out!"}
{"text":"I've been to Dillon's many times. Tonight was for Sunday dinner. We got there around 8:15. Place was pretty empty. Disappointed in the music. They went \"country\" on me. I really like this place because they (used to) play Classic Rock. I hope it's a Sunday Only thing, or maybe a one-time thing. Beware, place is always cold, bring a light cover. 

Service was good and fast. But, my turkey was cold and served in small pieces. I'm pretty sure since it was Sunday, and almost closing time, I got the scrapes. 

Believe it or not, I would still recommend this place. Just don't go close to closing time. You might not get their BEST!"}
{"text":"Best everything here. I swear, I've never had bbq AND sides this good in Phoenix.  The potato salad was the best I've ever had. Eat here, you won't regret it"}
{"text":"First time, the staff was not warm or welcoming, and the service wasn't great.  The food-well, we won't go back.  The chicken bbq was dry and lacked flavor.  The slaw didn't taste any different than something you'd buy premade at the grocer and it was way overpriced for what you get.
The mac/cheese was dry and our kiddo who doesn't eat much else, refused to eat it.
We won't go back-totally generic boring food and not worth the $50 we spent."}
{"text":"After having heard good things about Dillon's Kansas City style barbeque we decided to try it out  today.

We ordered three plate meals with sausage, pork ribs, pulled pork, brisket and burnt ends.

The brisket was very good.  Not dried out.

The burnt ends were cubed not sliced thin.  Great smoky flavor.  

The sausage was nicely smoked, a solid good but not outstanding.
 
The rib meat on the bone was very tender.  Not dried out.  Solid good. 

Pulled pork was wonderfully sweet and smoky.

The fried pickles appetizer were really good.

The sauces we tried were all good.  The sweet heat most representative of the spicy tomato based bbq sauce used in Kansas City.

For BBQ food in Phoenix the only place I've had that comes close to this good is  Haps.

Our server was warm, cheerful and efficient."}
{"text":"Because the food is great... I decided to give them another try for their service and I'm glad I did. We had the server Joshua K and he not only met my expectations but exceeded them. I had granddaughter and he was great with her, he made her laugh, Its obvious he's great with children. Thanks again for the wonderful experience. JM"}
{"text":"This place has amazing  food. Also the beer is always cold :) great  place  to watch sports."}
{"text":"The BBQ rib meat sandwich was unique and the BBQ sauce at Dillon's is sweet with more of a kiss than a bite.  The brisket was cooked perfectly with regard to being moist and tender, but the flavor was not intense or deep (needed more smoke or aging).  The service was fine, the fake brick walls are a little cheesy and the prices are OK.

This is a 3 star restaurant in a 4 star bar."}
{"text":"Well returned to this location and we had a short 20 minute wait for dinner on a Saturday night. We had never tried the ribs and that seems to be the best meat at this chain. They were lightly sauced and fell off the bone. Most of the side dishes were also good, except for the undercooked green beans and the cole slaw was too thickly chopped making it tough to eat. The turkey platter though had very thin sliced turkey that really lacked flavor. The turkey used to be thick cut, so maybe it's just a platter thing. Our waitress was very nice though and we used a BOGO offer which helped offset the one bad meal."}
{"text":"1 star...only because Yelp doesn't allow me to give anything less. We went in for dinner tonight and were seated immediately (you weren't that busy - remember this, because I wont allow you to use this as an excuse). We sat at our table for 10 minutes (I know because I clocked it) without even being acknowledged...all while servers and bussers were moving all around us. We got up and left, and I wasn't going to waste any more of my time by complaining to the manager, but my wife insisted. Unfortunately, the manager's attitude was that less than impressive due to the circumstance. Insincere, could not care less. Now, that could have just been my perception, but perception often is reality. 

Maybe I'm looking at this all wrong. Maybe I  should be praising you. I guess it is quite possible that you have invented a cloaking device that allowed myself and my family to become invisible while seated at this particular table."}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW! Our first visit will certainly not be our last! Our waitress Meghan was so helpful and Crystal the manager actually showed us the smoker, so cool! Besides the fact that the barbeque was to die for, we were treated like we were special, that our opinion mattered. You HAVE to try this place, you will be converts, just like us!"}
{"text":"Come to the Arrowhead location frequently as it is close to my house and on my way home from work. Good lunch stop, gets very busy in the evening. The food is good and well priced for the most part. 4 stars because I find the service slow, and more times than not they seem understaffed. Staff is friendly and all but when I'm on a lunch break it's tricky for me to be patient waiting 15 mins or more for a salad."}
{"text":"The best potato salad and onion rings eva! We love picking some up for a potluck. We get the half gallon size of potato salad and that is plenty for our group gatherings. Their potato salad doesn't have the tangy mustard or vinegar flavor in there, that's why it's so popular with our group of friends. I always order it to go and the folks at their 101 and 59th location are sooo friendly. Sometimes when my twin toddlers are sleeping in their car seats they bring it out to me at curbside. I love that convenience"}
{"text":"Love is place! They always have great customer service and delicious food. The portions are generous. It's a great place to take a family. Very relaxed atmosphere. Dillon's is one of our favorites!"}
{"text":"We had a groupon and gave it a try.  I will admit we might wait for another groupon.  Our waiter was great ...I think his name was Josh, super attentive and helpful with the menu, checked on us often.  We enjoyed the brisket and the pulled pork, the ribs were disappointing.  The Mac n cheese was good, all four of us enjoyed it as a side.  I liked the variety of sauces that came with our platter, we just weren't that impressed to pay their prices on a regular basis.

If there was another groupon, I would buy it."}
{"text":"We were visiting Scottsdale and had an array of restaurants on our list to try.  Most of them high-end big bucks:  Flemings, Mortons, Durants, Don & Charlies, etc.  It was so nice and comforting to go to Dillons and wear whatever we wanted - no need to dress up here.  It has good homey food and lots of it, - YUM!  We's just normal folks ya know!"}
{"text":"I feel that I have been ripped off. Ordered some \"St Luis\" style ribs for pick up ,first of all the price when I got their was two dollars more then the online menu!!  Secondly the ribs were not St louis style they were \"spare ribs\" with the sternum bone still in!  I'll give them two stars for flavor."}
{"text":"We had a great night celebrating my mother-in-law's birthday. The staff was amazing and accommodating. The manager, Jason and our server, Sarah were the best!  I would come here again and recommend you do too!"}
{"text":"Not sure what happened here. We ordered onion rings and they showed up after our dinner did. They were the most tasty part of the dinner. The ribs ( half and half spare and baby back) were dry and barely warm. The salad had hair in it. The potato was also barley warm. The waitress was cute but not to bright. Not sure we will every go back. It may have been an off day but man it was bad. Oh yah we brought ribs home for my son and he did not even eat them and said they were nasty. They went into the trash."}
{"text":"I'm fine with the food here if we can ever get served ... but trying to get these girls to acknowledge us when we sit down to get food is another story. How rude is it that these servers don't bother to say \"hello, or I'll be right with you\" and on top of that we have to find them to pay our bill so we can leave. They need to stop chit chatting with others and pay some attention to the people that are coming in or find a different job. This has been our experience the last 5 xs we tried to eat there, I don't think we will be going back anymore sadly."}
{"text":"Great place for bbq. Has been for years . I like there bbq chicken. There chicken fried chicken is great. As well as beans . Great service and atmosphere. Been back many times."}
{"text":"Note:  I've actually been to Dillon's Thunderbird as well, but I go here more often so I figured people could review this location separately if they wanted.

For anyone whos ever been to Kansas City, they know theres a distinctly different feel when you goto a suburban BBQ restaurant versus an urban BBQ joint.  In Kansas City, a perfect example would be KC Masterpiece Grill (a suburban BBQ restaurant) versus Arthur Bryant's (an urban BBQ joint).  In Phoenix, we have a similar equivalent.  Honey Bear's is more of an urban BBQ joint whereas Dillon's fits the suburban BBQ restaurant to a tee.

The differences between places like Dillon's and Honey Bear's lie mostly in the atmosphere.  Dillon's is a nice easy going sit down restaurant that just happens to serve barbeque whereas Honey Bear's is the type of place where there isn't much room to sit, its sounds like a crowded bar on a busy day, and the aroma grabs you right from the get go.  Each has its charm.  But for this review, let's talk Dillon's food and atmosphere.

Much like their original location at Thunderbird and the 101, the Dillon's at 59th Ave just north of the 101 serves up a cozy restaurant style atmosphere with a full bar near the front and plenty of seating everywhere else (including the patio).  I've never had trouble getting a table here as this place is pretty tucked away near the Arrowhead golf course communities.  The crowd usually varies depending on the type of day, but most of the time you'll see young families, workers from nearby, and couples nearing retirement.   I've always had friendly service, but I've always been baffled by how slow service is.  Like I said, I've never seen it crowded so one would think you could get in and get a meal pretty quick, but its never worked out that way.  So does the food make up for it?

Mostly.  My favorite time to come here is lunch as their lunch menu is basically the same as dinner (only cheaper) and the sandwiches usually hit the spot.  The pulled pork and brisket sandwiches are among my favorites as the portion of meat is usually just right and they throw on the right amount of sauce.  Steak fries or beans usually go pretty well with these.  If ribs are your thing, they've got you covered with baby back or pork spare ribs usually being the tried and true favorites.  The appetizers (while diverse) aren't terribly special as they're about what I'd expect to find at most restaurants (onion rings, quesadillas, artichoke dip, etc.).  I will say that the cinnamon apple dumplin for dessert is pretty tasty.

Like I said, the prices are pretty reasonable at lunch.  Dinner is a little more expensive, but still not bad.  So why 3 stars?  Bottomline, its okay.  Nothing great or amazing, nothing bad or disgusting.  Just decent.  The quintessential suburban barbecue spot.  You'll leave satisfied, but probably longing for the more authentic barbecue joint like me."}
{"text":"We went to Dillon's tonight for some appetizers and a cold beer. We have been here many times and have never had a bad experience. Tonight was no exception! We had the opportunity, while sitting in the bar area, to be served by Dawn. What a breath of fresh air she was! She was quick to take our order and check back with us often to see how we were doing or if we needed anything. She was friendly, professional, and very attentive. Thanks to Dawn, and of course the great food, we had another great experience at Dillons!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for a while now, and it's always been great service and food. Today was over the top, Tia really made us feel at home and appreciated. She was really service oriented and very fast. We appreciate the great hospitality always."}
{"text":"Pretty bad. I went the other day and got a pulled chicken sandwich. The chicken was cold and dry and the bun was soggy. I think the sandwich had been sitting a while. I emailed the manager later and told them about it and they never responded. Thee pits again which is pretty close by has pulled chicken that is seriously 100x better than this place. I used to go to Dillons on Northern and they seemed to be higher quality as well. I used to get pounds of brisket to go there and never had a problem.  I think it's just this location. I won't return to this forgettable place, which is sad because I'm so close now at MWU."}
{"text":"The stars say it all. 2 Stars = Meh, I've experience better.
First time here because friend knew I like good BBQ.
I do, I LOVE Great BBQ.
Dillon's was neither. 
First time there I ordered a combo platter with three (3) meats. 
Brontosaurus Beef Ribs - 1 single Baby Back rib has more meat on it that one of these.
Sad, very sad.
The brisket was bland. OK, smoke ring, but barely tasted the smoke. How do they do that?????
The burnt ends were just OK.Meaty, but bland. DO they wash the smoke off?
The mac and cheese was edible, but I think Kraft does a better job and that is gross.
Did they not like me and not want me back as a customer?
They win, I won't be back. Tooooo many other options."}
{"text":"I have written a review about this location before hoping they would improve. Sadly they haven't. It is my opinion that their cook does not know how to prepare a decent soup. Tonight was no exception. Ordered a 1/2 brisket and cup of soup which was suppose to be \"Chicken and Dumplings\".  I don't know about you but I was expecting a broth with chicken and dumplings, not a stew with heavy chunks of carrots,celery and spicy. So thick that you had to eat it with a fork. Plenty of chicken chunks but guess what NO DUMPLINGS. The only reasons we go here is because we have a Groupon and I love their BBQ. While we were eating we heard two other tables complaining about issues with their dinner, service and time issues. Have you ever seen anyone from this restaurant respond to a posting?  Guess NO ONE cares."}
{"text":"Being a Kansas native I was excited to try Dillons KC stle BBQ. I grew up eating incredible BBQ, my dad entered many competitions and won most of them. Eventually he opened a successful restaurant. Yes, my expectations are high, but good food shouldn't be an anomaly. 

As first time customers we were treated to a stack of their famous onion rings. They arrived golden, piping hot, and delicious. We'd struck taste bud gold, or so I thought. My daughter and I ordered the brisket plate with vegetables and coleslaw, my son ordered the pulled pork sandwich with a side of Mac and cheese. His plate came looking delicious, bubbling hot Mac and cheese and a good sized, well filled pulled pork sandwich. Being 14, he gulped it down within minutes, his opinion of food is questionable at best. I was disappointed that we weren't given an assortment of sauces at the table but rather had to tell them what we wanted in it and didn't have control over how much or the ability to mix our own. My daughter's and my plates came looking sadly underwhelming. The vegetable was asparagus which was slightly overcooked and the tough end of the stems intact. The seasoning was good, however. The brisket itself was very thinly sliced with what looked like a small smoke ring (which turned out not to be, as there was no discernable taste of smoky flavor). While the meat was tender, it lacked any flavor whatsoever. The coleslaw was also flavorless and had very little dressing. While I'm not a fan of a floating, mushy coleslaw, I do enjoy one with a bright, flavorful dressing. I disliked my meal and didn't eat much of it, said bottomless pit son finished it all. My daughter ate her meal but didn't enjoy it. With tip we spent over $60 - a good chunk of change for what turned out to be so disappointing. Sadly, In & Out would have been a better choice."}
{"text":"Josh was our waiter at 59th Ave.  He was extremely personable and attentive.  We had great service.  Thanks, R and M"}
{"text":"Great BBQ half chicken, wings, house salad, and of course, their famous onion rings. (If it's your first time, ask for their free onion rings!). Wasn't crazy about the grilled Salmon, though, as it was overdone, but order right and you'll love this place!"}
{"text":"My wife and I eat out 7 nights weekly so we are choosy about where we eat.  This is another of the regular restaurants we eat at at least once per week.  The servers are consistent and the food is consistent as well.  We like the burger, pulled pork sandwich, huge fries, onion rings, chili, clam chowder on Friday and my wife likes the variety of salads.  The price is right too.  We have used their take out a few times too."}
{"text":"Great food!!! Horrible drinks!!! You really have to order a double to taste anything!!!!!!!!! it's not even a cocktail  but really good food Just eat & get out. Down the road is Zipps sports bar & Heroes sports bar each 1 makes a good drink & you don't need to order a double to taste anything."}
{"text":"Once again, I find myself wanting to like this place but after reading a few recent reviews I see that my view of this place is shared by several others.  Namely, the place looks a little run-down and worn.  Granted this place seems to be busy but I agree that the quality of the food was lacking even though we had very good service from our waiter Sam.  I had the baby back ribs, my wife had the half-and-half, and my nephew had the pulled pork.  My baby back ribs were just ok, and the only sauces they make are a little out of the ordinary, yet tasty.  My complaints were in the general quality of the meats, and the tenderness of the meats were lacking.  We all commented that the ribs (which should be fall off the bone or at least very tender) were something that required a knife.  The sauces, (which I'm used to mild, medium, hot, etc.) were a lineup of sweet-hot, regular and regular flavored with cajun seasoning.  This didn't appear to be a good lineup for me as I favor really hot spicy BBQ sauces (and I don't like \"sweet\"), like the kind Westport BBQ would provide in KC.  Additionally, none of us were \"wowed\" by the side dishes.  The potato salad wasn't flavorful, the coleslaw was too mayonaisy, and the baked beans were just so-so.  

Sam our waiter was very kind and did a nice job of waiting on us but I don't think I'll be back anytime soon.  I prefer Bobby Q's so far for this type of fare in the valley."}
{"text":"My favorite BBQ restaurant. Great ribs as well as awesome pretzels and onion rings. Love their wedge salad too. The Peoria restaurant is a lot larger than it appears - I've never had to wait for a table."}
{"text":"Good spot to sit and watch sports. As far as the food...  it's so-so overall.   Brisket is ok. Fried apps are ok. Nothing to write home about. Great for the convenience if you live nearby."}
{"text":"The four stars is for the food and service. Now COME ON MAN! you got a regular patron drunk at the bar bothering everyone who will listen and not only are the bartender and the manager still serving him but he's going to drive home after you keep serving him, really? Simply made us go elsewhere after we ate."}
{"text":"Took the family on a Saturday night and they had dueling pianos. What a great experience for the little ones. The food was on point and Kari was an excellent server. Super nice and I love it when the servers acknowledge my girls. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"The chicken quesadilla and the fried pickles we're amazing. 
We've had dinner plates but the appetizer menu is off-the-hook
Supper happy"}
{"text":"Was invited to a party it was nice they have a big room in the back that was nice. Split the ribs with my wife big portion. The ribs had a good taste and came off the bone. The potato salad was very good as well. The green beans i probably  would not order. Ribs were 23$ for a full rack."}
{"text":"I've been to Dillion's a couple of times and will keep on coming back for more. The first time I was there I ate on one of the high top tables in the bar area and ordered a Brisket Sandwich with fries and a soda. I think I spent about $16 with the tip. The Brisket sandwich was ginormous and delicious. The fries were excellent along with the service from the bartenderess (okay I just made up a word that should be added to the dictionary).

The second time I had the pulled pork sandwich and it was meaty and tasty as well. I came in with some out of town family members and they ordered the fish tacos and ribs if I remember correctly. Everyone enjoyed their meals. Sorry Dillion's - my picky wife was hard to please. But the guy driving the car chooses the restaurant.

Also. sign up with your phone number for some discounts on your next visits."}
{"text":"Two months out of the year friends of mine rent a house within walking distance of Dillon's and after having walked there with them recently I had to wonder:  Is Dillon's the reason they rent that house?  

The sun was still shining when we made our way over for dinner, hours earlier than I usually care to eat, but they knew the drill.  Even early, the place was packed, with a live band playing in a semi-soundproof room off the bar.  Dillon's gets that party started.  

We cadged a table in the bar area, bypassing those waiting for a table not in that area, then decided to just eat dinner from that locale which seemed not significantly different from the non-bar area.  

Dillon's was described to me as a place that everyone could find  something they wanted and the size of the menu made that readily apparent.  Their specialty may be BBQ but you certainly don't have to stay in that lane.  

I opted for a big bowl of chili (with burnt ends); it included a salad and the whole thing was under $10.  A Brisket Platter with heaps of food was under $17.  It's fairly impossible to leave here feeling a) hungry or b) like you've gotten ripped off.  There's a reason Dillon's has a packed house  as early as 5:30 p.m.: tasty, well-priced food and lots of it. 

It might not be reason enough to rent a house within walking distance but if you chose to I'd understand."}
{"text":"We had take out for our Christmas lunch, brisket, turkey, sausage, beans and coleslaw, food was excellent.  We have since had lunch there a few times, same excellent food and service.  We highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Again, still looking for a restaurant to replace Dillons Grand!!! And this is not it, service was great! Manager came by at least three times to make sure every thing was alright. Just the food seems to be different? Don't know why? I have always loved their burnt ends! But it was not as good here? Other than that it was fine."}
{"text":"Another Dillon's, second one this month. The more I go there, the more I like it. This time I tried the Nachos, which is on the appetizer portion of the menu. Looked good so I ordered it.  When it arrived it was way more than an appetizer, it was a appetizer for two or three. But being a charter member of the \"clean plate\" club, I tried to finish.  My membership went out the window, no way I could finish. Right now the remainder is in a box in my fridge waiting for a late night snack. The nachos were great, including good size pieces of barbecue pork, chili, cheeses, peppers, onions and sour cream on top. A bit messy, but that is the way it is suppose to be. Those around me had pulled pork sandwiches which were huge, it was like, eat one, take one home.  Good food, good service, pleasant atmosphere. The Club will be back."}
{"text":"Beef ribs were pretty good but couldn't for the life of me figure out why they put corn in the macaroni. Was really disappointed about that. Otherwise the rest of the food wasn't bad. I lived in Kansas City for a few years so I got spoiled with quality BBQ. Tip to the owners, don't put corn in the macaroni, it makes you look like amateurs."}
{"text":"During our weekend in Phoenix we were looking for a place to watch UFC-141 and were denied at a couple of places due to  them being full and we had a party of 8 (4 kids under 11) and no room at the bar, LOL

We found Dillon's Arrowhead was playing the fight and we walked in but again the bar area was full.. luckily the manager opened up the green room where there was one TV. The whole room was decorated up with Military flags, pictures, plaques, and such. Much to my daughter's delight there were Marine Logo's all over and she took great pleasure in pointing them all out to me.

The food was good BBQ was tender and had a tasty sauce. Pretty good selection of beers, your typical national brands and some good local and national craft brews as well. our server was very patient with us and took good care of us even though I think we were holding her over her scheduled time to be off work, so we tipped her VERY well for her efforts. 

Worth a try if you live in the area or are just passing through and like BBQ!

Sláinte!"}
{"text":"Large portions, very good bbq sauce and good service it's just a bit pricey for lunch."}
{"text":"5 stars for having the Hockey playoff games Bruins and the Blackhawks. Two great teams! My friend ordered a $4 bar food item, their chili-cheese fries with brisket ends. I couldn't believe the size of this thing! Apparently it was a hit! I didn't try it. I ate prior to watching the ending of the game.  Waitress...I don't know her name was great! She was spot on with naming all kinds of beers they offered with confidence. I was impressed."}
{"text":"Nobody has gotten back to me. Kali had asked me for the server name and ticket number several days ago but, I haven't heard back."}
{"text":"Went to Dillon's for lunch on 1/24, and had the half-order of onion rings and a brisket sandwich.  Both were fresh, hot, and delicious.  The brisket was amazing, smoky, and tender . . . probably the best I've ever had.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great place!  Loved the band playing in the bar....as we arrived at 9:10 for dinner as if we were Euro-Trash or something!!   I had a BBQ twosome of Baby Backs & Burnt-Ends....others in our group had beef stew (ehhh) and a Caesar Salad which was excellent.

The Baby Backs were on par with some of the best in the nation....I kid you not....but the burnt ends were not even close to the Kansas CIty BBQ staple that inspired this dish......too small chunks and the sauce was overwhelming.   Baby backs again? Hell Yes!!  Burnt Ends.....most likely not.

Great place!!

addendum: Based on my Yelp review I received a very kind and thoughtful letter from Dillion's Mgmt.  Thanking me for my business and a commitment to bettering the dish I was not so fond of.....how many times does this happen????   Going to Dillion's the second I get back in town!  Class Act!!   Previous 3 Stars upped to 4!!!  Gotta Love an American Business committed to a HIGH standard of Customer Service."}
{"text":"It was good. Service was okay. I personally wasn't a fan of the red devil sandwich I had. I have to go back to try something else. The fries were really good. We got the zucchini and the sweet potato fries for the table."}
{"text":"We were on vacation and found Dillon's with a groupon. The food was good - hubby had burnt ends and I had bbq chicken. Both were very tender and juicy. Bbq beans and baked potato sides were very good. Coleslaw and asparagus sides were ok. Service was excellent! Kelsey was our server - she was prompt, attentive, helpful and friendly. We sat in restaurant area (away from the bar) which was quieter. Heard the live band on our way out and they were pretty decent. Overall, good food and great service!"}
{"text":"Normally really enjoy Dillon's and would give them 4 or 5 stars.  
Tonight we had a party of 11, not really that big (and we all are good tippers).  The food was good as always but the waitress was mediocre at best!  Was pretty disappointed....."}
{"text":"I really like this place, but must admit we never pay full price.  We almost always get a $15 for $30 ticket which is perfect for a table for two...after tip we are usually out of there for just over $20 with having had a beer and a sandwich.

I love there Red Devil BBQ sandwich..it comes w/ coleslaw on top which is a great flavor with the hot sandwich advertised as \"hotter than an Arizona summer\".

They have $2 onion rings which obviously isn't a huge basket, but they are really good and we get them everytime.

I took off a star because the last 2 times we've been here my loaded mashed potatos have come out very cold...when I mentioned it to the servers they apologized and came back w/ a heaping bowl of potatoes...IDK if they got microwaved, but they tasted great.

I've noticed that they do run a lot of drink specials (bar only) particularly during baseball games.  We need to go back and try the HH specials which we haven't done yet but it's on our to do list."}
{"text":"I received a yellow post it note on my desk written in black ink.. 

DINNER TONIGHT @ 6 SHARP! 

DILLONS.... 

twice underlined.... 

that being said i must go right? 

we walk in and people are leaving with smiles and laughs... the atmosphere was so warm and welcoming.. 

I love the Decor... little cows all over the place... some with wings.. and pigs too... it was adorable! reminds me of walking into my friends grandparents house... 

their menu has a nice selection... :) 

our waitress was very bubbly and attentive... 

he had smoked sausage and brisket.. he raved over it... but i didn't want to try it... he had the HOT BBQ sauce.... i didn't have my tums... 

i had the pulled pork with the sweet BBQ sauce... oh my... it was amazing... the pork alone was so tender and just fabulous! and the awesome BBQ sauce just topped it off... 

their potato salad is great to.. i think they used red potatoes... which are my favorite... 

i like that they have a veggie of the day... that day was Broccoli... it was tasty! 

their bread roll was wheat.. so i was excited... but it wasn't that great.. maybe next time.... 

the lemon Water was fabulous as always... 

Over all... 

service ... AWESOME 
Food.... Cant Beat it 
Bathroom... Clean and Tidy 
Atmosphere.. homey and relaxing... 

I cant wait to go again :)"}
{"text":"My friend just moved here and wanted BBQ.  We went to Dillion's and he loved it.  I had the brisket and it was delicious."}
{"text":"This place has their operations down to a science. The food was to die for and the service was impeccable.

I ordered the beef ribs (I've discovered that very few places in the valley even have beef ribs) and the wife ordered beef tips, the food quality exceeded my expectations.  The beef ribs were HUGE (Brontosaurus-sized), you will have plenty to take home!

This place will not disappoint you!."}
{"text":"Have eaten at other Dillons locations and it has been pretty good.  Not a good experience this time.  Management needs to understand that blaring the TVs so loud you cannot talk is not what your customers were looking for.  There was one table and most of the staff watching the fight they had on.  Everyone else was annoyed.  Food was average at best and I don't remember this from the past but seemed over priced.  Server had no interest what so ever.  Could have been a drone.  Biggest joke of the night was the glass of wine my wife ordered.  Wine was bad and the glass and pour were comical.  We took pictures the glass was so small.  There are plenty of quality house wines you can serve a decent pour with for $7 - $9.  Pay attention.  The plastic mug of wine at Ray's Pizza is several points better and cheaper.  Won't go back again."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the 50/50 platter. Everything about the meal was delicious even the two sides were perfect. Great meal for single guy for a Sunday night."}
{"text":"I can honestly say that I'm a fan of Dillon's. Yeah, it's no Memphis barbecue joint on Bealle street, but it's very homely and absolutely delicious. 

I generally order the brisket, but the sandwiches, fish, and ribs are awesome and highly recommended. Stay away from the spinach enchiladas though. They really have no business doing Mexican food.

Sit at the bar, get a drink, and enjoy the company. Anyone I've ever met in there are always good people...."}
{"text":"Dillon's has good barbecue! We took family there and we all enjoyed the good, service, and music.  We had a bit of a wait, but not long. We enjoyed the singer while we waited."}
{"text":"This place is great for BBQ. They even have their own smoker which is pretty impressive. I usually just grab a beer at the bar and get my food to go. There's something about the dining area that reminds me of an elderly cafeteria style room. 

Try the Carolina pulled pork."}
{"text":"We ate dinner on Saturday night and the food was awesome! Great BBQ and the service was top notch! This was the first time eating at this Dillon's and we will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Hands down best place for bbq in AZ . Build your own platter with sausage and beef with the Cajun sauce"}
{"text":"Have eaten here twice now and both times were delicious. The meat was moist and the pulled pork had that perfect wood smoke flavor. The pulled chicken was great and the burnt ends were good as well. I wasn't too big on the brisket but it was still good. The sauces were great and for sides I can't say enough about the mashed potatoes and the coke slaw is almost the same as KFC. They were out of ingredients to make 2 drinks I wanted but I was there more for the food"}
{"text":"I have been trying to come to this place for years, but the number of cars in the parking lot & people waiting outside is a little intimating.  LOL!  I finally told my brother we are going for lunch and that is it.  

Country Fried Chicken Platter was my pick for poison - Chicken was at the right thickness, batter was just spot on (not too thick and the right amount of crunchy), then the country gravy (ahhhhhhhahhh- yes, that is me singing).  I paired this poison with mac & cheese and mash potatoes.  WOW!  GREAT STUFF!  I was so busy stuffing my face, I forgot to save room for dessert.  

I sat in the room by the window where the kamikaze birds hit the window, scary at first but then if the window was not there, they would be hitting me???"}
{"text":"I don't normally post reviews, just use yelp to decide where to eat. I have to say that I was really impressed with my first visit to Dillon's. I have to be in a mood for BBQ so driving home I hit the Yelp app and checked out what was around. Saw Dillon's and BBQ sounded amazing. I pull into the parking lot and its PACKED, drove around a couple of times then found a spot. It is St. Patty's day so it was SLAMMED inside. Knowing I was ordering to go I immediately regretted not calling in. I asked the hostess, who was juggling a bunch of people picking up their orders and the phone ringing of the hook like a pro, how long it would take she said \"we are a bit backed up so it might be like 15 minutes, sorry I know its normally about 5\" I laughed and told her 15 minutes was nothing and placed my order. I decided to grab a beverage at the bar. I walked up to the bar there was one open seat but I decided I didn't want to sit. Within 5 second of me walking up the bartender had my drink order. I finished my drink in about 10 minutes and went to go wait in the lobby. Low and behold my food was ready. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with mild BBQ sauce, and a side of Mac and Cheese (recommended by the hostess). It was FANTASTIC! Nothing negative to say at all. I also appreciated that the hostess took the time to ask about my day and had an actual human interaction with me when it was clear she was doing 10389238840 things at once. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I wish I could rate these guys higher.  The atmosphere is fun, but the food is just... blah.

With that being said, $2 onion rings are fantastic - but everything else (BBQ Brisket, Turkey, sandwiches of all types) leave a lot to be desired.

Buns are soggy, meat is tough and unflavorful, just all together not delicious-  not horrible - but not \"come back\" good either.  

Worth a try, but you'll probably come to the same conclusion as we did.  Not worth it."}
{"text":"Have been here twice with friends.

Drink options are great and affordable. 
Dining is bad. Food is always bland and feels microwaved. No one said anything positive about their meal.

Service was 4 star. Very nice waiters."}
{"text":"Awesome BBQ and an awesome setting for the 5 kids in our party. All the BBQ was cooked perfectly. Rib meat fell right off the bone. Peach salad was one of the best I have eaten. Extensive kids menu. Excellent service. Food came out quickly. Casual setting and happy hour from 2-7pm Monday through Friday."}
{"text":"Dillon is the shiznit... best bbq n wings great service and waitress's have nice butts"}
{"text":"Dillon's is apparently a chain of sport bar/Kansas City bbq restaurants. The one I visited was set in one of the Phoenix megapolis shopping centers. The crowd was a mix of young and old, most seemed oblivious of the 10 or 12 large TV screens that each had some sort of sporting event on them. The noise level was moderate to high, but we had no trouble hearing each other at our table. 

The servers were friendly and as attentive as they could be, since it was a busy night for a Thursday. It took longer than I expected to get our meal, but our drinks appeared very quickly.

I had the build your own plate. Choice of 2 meats and 2 sides from a list of 7 or 8 of each. $19.99, which seemed fair as the portions were substantial. I had the  beef ribs and burnt ends, with the potato salad and bbq beans. I chose the hottest bbq sauce they had, the hot-sweet sauce.

The ribs were smoked and so tender I didn't need anything but my fork to pull the meat off the bone. The burned ends were equally tender, both were delicious. The bbq sauce had a pleasant mixture of sweet and heat, although I would have preferred more of the latter! The potato salad had more mayo than I like, but was ok. The beans were delicious.

My wife had fish tacos and thought they were very good. And huge! We saw lots of people asking for containers for their leftovers."}
{"text":"Fantastic BBQ... Best I've had in the valley and they have an extensive catering menu available on short notice that everyone will enjoy. Service was ok but not the best... Waitress was flighty and didn't pay much attention to us, had to flag her down for requested (and forgotten sides)."}
{"text":"My husband and I loved this place! We can't come often,because we live in Mesa, and it is a LONG drive, but if it was closer, we would be here weekly! Give it a try, you will be glad you did! A++"}
{"text":"Have been going to Dillon's for years. First to their location on Thunderbird Road and more recently to the Arrowhead location. The food can't be beat. Between my husband and I we have had about 60% of the items on the menu. Everything's great. I have to tell you this place has THE BEST onion rings you will ever have. Currently you can get a half order for $1.00. Make sure you ask for a side of the \"ancho\" sauce with your onion rings otherwise they usually just bring out ranch dressing and ketchup. They also are offering any sandwich on their menu for $6.99 seven days per week. The sandwiches come with pickle and one side item. The Dillon's Dip sandwich is my favorite. It's a french dip served with a side of au jus and a side of sour cream horseradish mixture. The meat on the sandwich is flavorful and the au jus is not too salty which can be a problem at a lot of restaurants. The pulled pork platter is great as are any of the rib dishes. Best side dishes in my opinion are the mashed potatoes with brown or cream gravy, the baked beans, or the potato salad.   They also have daily drink specials for $3.00.   The special on Tuesday's is the margarita.   They're great margarita's for only $3.00.    The atmosphere is casual.    Great food you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We were at the restaurant for the first time  on Thursday 5/17. After we we were seated the speaker system was noticeably in need of adjustment as a constant bass noise  was the welcoming music. 
My husband ordered a cheeseburger which came bone dry with strips of red onion and small tomato slices and lettuce. The burger at Culvers makes this look like an afterthought at $11.00. The side was macaroni and cheese which was serve in a dish that my granddaughter would find small, a spoon size serving. My wife had a taco salad served at room temperature lettuce. No cheese in the salad, had to ask for cheese. All in all a first time/last time visit. One star represents the beer was cold."}
{"text":"Service was pleasant, my friends side came out cold and my prime rib temperature was off but besides that I think was just okay."}
{"text":"Overall.  We enjoy it.    The experience has been hit and miss depending on the menu item.  Service is good.  We have had enough good experience to keep coming back."}
{"text":"Like the ambiance in the bar, they have an onion ring appetizer for two dollars that is just the right size for one beer. The rest of the food is also good, crowd is not as old as what you find at the Thunderbird location"}
{"text":"Despite the tone of this review I will be going back to check them out during their regular service.

How a place that's been rated  Yay! consistently could serve such uninspired  institutional dreck on Thanksgiving is a puzzle worth investigating.

Regardless how good they are usually the idea that it's OK for turkey dinner to consist of lunchmeat turkey , yep not part of a single breast but some formed  sliced  close to deli meat at Fry's,excuse for a turkey.

Seriously this has to be a one off? 

On the grocery story theme sweet potatoes, canned, no gravy,undercooked cornbread stuffing, grainy cranberry sauce  rounded off with a lacklustre dessert which was still thawing.

The only saving grace was the BBQ meat / sauce itself  which,gosh, probably was made in house and I wouldn't mind more of. 

Service was good, despite the in-law's treating the server abruptly , and all in all it's a pretty nice  atmosphere for family dining during the day."}
{"text":"Love the food at Dillons at 59th Ave and the atmosphere! The menu has many great choices ranging from their wonderful salads to the BBQ Sandwiches.

I hold The 101 Referral Network -west meetings at this location on the last Tuesday night of each month from 6:30 pm to 7:30 pm where we bring together Westside business owners. 

The management is fantastic and very supportive of our group and we are very appreciative for this!"}
{"text":"I'm impressed. Braxton approached me and apologized for not introducing himself and being social with the patrons. This takes a lot of character to admit and even though he is young he has promise with a willingness to learn and improve. Thank you."}
{"text":"The owner/manager seems to be a psycho path. Selling t shirts right inside the door with the soliders boots and gun, with a giant \"DILLONS\" behind it. Wow. Way to capitalize on the death of our soldiers. What a clown. Also the whole back room is full of republican propaganda. Really really weird. 

I'm only giving two stars for the food, which was decent, not great, but decent. 

Horrendous service. She stopped by our table a total of 4 times, which included taking our order, bringing beer, and delivering/returning the check. We also had to wait about 10 minutes for her to return the check. Nothing drains your tip faster than me sitting there waiting to leave while you lolly gag around. 

Won't be back."}
{"text":"The quality for the price is not worth it. Had brisket and pulled pork both dry, dry, dry and bland. Brisket was sliced paper thin. In NW valley if you want proper BBQ for quality and price go to Pork on a Fork!"}
{"text":"We had the best experience !! Courtney our waitress was the most friendly, attentative, knowledgeable and really made our first trip here a great one !! We will be back and will ask specifically for her ! Food was amazing ! Almost as good as the service !!"}
{"text":"Went to Dillons last night with a group for a free wine tasting and dinner.    Dinner was just OK disappointed in the pulled pork very dry.  Winetasting which was advertised on Facebook was nothing more than a ruse to get people in for a wine club.  Kind of a sneaky way to get people to a home party and pay for dinner.   It was crazy chaotic and not well planned.   To top it off my waitress shorted me when she returned my change and then gave me attitude when I asked for it back this was all prior to leaving a tip.   Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Ok I've been to Dillon's probably 20 times in the past few years but I realized that I never wrote a review???  We have been here especially more since we now live very close and this location is convenient.

What do I always seem to get...even though I love BBQ I always get the fried catfish platter with Mac and cheese and mashed potatoes. I'm a huge fan of catfish and Dillion's is one of the best. Like I said before I'm also a huge BBQ fan so then wife usually gets a 2-3 meat platter with the smoked turkey and Burnt Ends when they have them. Very good and very filling sight the sides. We always get plenty to eat. 

We like sit in the bar area so we can watch the game and enjoy our food. Service has always been good. Dillion's is a very good local neighborhood restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm not sure who my server was but Jason the manger did come over to my table to let me know that I could NOT use my 5$ reward that we had. Every time there is an issue with their point system and the service is not that great! Food is just okay. I prob won't ever be back!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious! The portions size was very large with a great price tag. The customer service was also great, very attentive and very nice one of the best restaurants I've been to in along time and the best part was the giant shark tank oh what a beautiful view while enjoying your food and hanging with the family we had such a great time can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a rack of baby backs and they were delicious. I used a LivingSocial off that provided a nice discount. Bar was crowded when I arrived but slowed down after an hour. Great place fir BBQ."}
{"text":"I have been here many times with my parents. The food is so delicious! Their baked beans are amazing! Sweet and tangy! I love their rolls also! I've had the ribs, pulled pork, their turkey everything I've tried has been good."}
{"text":"We reserved there back room for a private retirement party from 3PM-6PM.  Upon arrival the room had tables that weren't cleaned, it wasn't ready for our event. We had drinks appetizers with one server who was doing a great job for not having any other support from any other team members. Are main issue was after having dinner some of guests were going to order desert about 5:30 but then Dillon's Restaurant Manager  started letting another party in the our private back room because they had a party after us they started over taking our area and completely ruined our retirement party.  The manager on duty poorly handled this situation, he had smirk  and poor attitude."}
{"text":"Someone who has lived in Kansas City, this is not KC BBQ. The pulled pork tasted like it was marinated in vinegar overnight. Ordered two sodas; flat. Server left them on the table. Server gave us new sodas; flat. Sever left these on the table. Server charged us for sodas. Restaurant now wants to give 22% gratuity to servers that don't even know the fundamentals of hospitality. Just moved to Arrowhead Lakes, but will avoid this place going forward. Shame."}
{"text":"Ate there last night for dinner. I had the huge brontosaurus ribs. The flavor was great I love their Cajun Spice. The beef ribs were like all other beef ribs: a little fatty. Why in Arizona everything has to be dumped in BBQ sauce. How about letting the rub and smoke be the flavor. The mashed potatoes and BBQ beans were pretty awesome. 

My main complaint was that the service wasn't very good. I judge my service on if I am waiting for drink refills, if they go the order right, and if they over ask me how everyhing is.
I waited for my drink twice, my girlfriend once. 
I ordered the mac n cheese and got mashed potatoes (too hungry to ask for the mac)
She asked a couple times- not over asked

I am a fan and will be back. Great food."}
{"text":"Wow, that's all I can say! The BBQ is out of this world and the service is even better, if you can believe that. Our waitress, Alex, literally went above and beyond and had a great smile the entire time. She was knowledgeable about everything on the menu and made the best recommendations... couldn't have been better! The mojitos made by Kelly were the best I've ever taisted North of Mexico and South of Canada. You gotta check it out!"}
{"text":"It was my wife's birthday and we went there with my in laws. We ordered the build your own platter and got the brontosaurus ribs. On the menu they advertise tender and slow smoked ribs. That wasn't the case here I bit into a rib and the meat didn't fall off the bone, the bone flew across the table because I yanked the bone just to pull the meat away from my mouth to eat it. I guess they smoked the ribs with an imposter smoker because there was no smoke flavor to them. Maybe they should stick with the pulled pork and brisket and leave the real smoked meat to the professionals.

Update 11/15/2017
Kelly
Here is a fall off the bone beef rib from a real bbq restaurant here in the valley. You cannot tell me that beef rib meat can't fall off the bone."}
{"text":"Good place for happy hour - the bar is fun and they have great happy hour specials. The restaurant is pretty old school as far as it appearance but the food is good."}
{"text":"Outstanding food, most of the time at least, but the service at this Arrowhead location is terrible. 

As other reviewers have noted numerous times, service at this location is inexplicably slow. I have been there when it was packed, empty and everything in-between. I have been there with my wife, my family members, with work for team and group events, you name it, and the service has always been poor. 

More recently, I have found that even when the place is nearly empty and there are more wait-staff than diners, you still cannot get timely service. It seems to always be friendly service, as others have pointed out, just extremely slow. On our last visit, my wife and I sat ignored in a booth for over fifteen minutes, arms folded in front of empty plates, waiting for a check since a refill never came and nobody checked on us after the food came out. 

I took this to the management and spoke with them for probably the third or fourth time about their service problem and also sent a lengthy email to the owners as well, describing my service experience and the consistent pattern of bad service (and no apology) at this particular location. 

The end result? The owners never even responded to my email, despite numerous assurances from the manager that they would speak to me. As a result, I've decided to never patronize this location or any other Dillon's ever again. I will sorely miss the food, as will my wife and our family, but I will not dine at an establishment where the owners give repeat customers (who struggle to remain loyal) the cold shoulder. 

Customer service is clearly not a priority at Dillon's and, judging by the owners' lack of response to a concerned customer, it obviously is a top-down problem. 

I would avoid this place if you expect great service, because it has never been my experience and I doubt it ever will be when the management has this kind of attitude towards customer service."}
{"text":"Ordered take out and wanted a beer while I waited. Is that too much to ask? Well guess it is because the bartender never looked beyond the old regulars on the other side of the bar! I guess we are not that important!  I guess they do not need the extra revenue, so our money and business will go elsewhere"}
{"text":"OMFG!  Love everything about this place.  Awsome food! Sweet and attentive servers...of course our favorite is Heather!!!  

It feels like home...can't get enough!!!  A must try!!!"}
{"text":"My parents Like to come here, so I often meet them for lunch.
This means free food for me, so the price is awesome.
Service is always friendly, and the food is pretty darn good.
I love a cold beer and some fried zucchini, and they have it, so that's pretty sweet.
They could expand on their beer selection, that would be OK by me.

Convenient location, cold beer, tasty BBQ.  Even if I did have to pay I think I would come here."}
{"text":"Plain old bbq nothing special service ok.food ok. Gteat bbq at bobby q .that bobby Q #1"}
{"text":"I love Dillons' food. However, I think the Dillon's on Thunderbird is a little better than the Arrowhead location. The vegetables are better seasoned there and the Mac and Cheese is much better.
The chicken fried chicken and the spinach enchiladas are the best."}
{"text":"A very friendly family establishment. Been eating here for more than 5 years with my family. My kids grew up enjoying smiley face fries & now as teenagers they still prefer them smiley fries on their entree's. Onion rings are cooked to perfection each & every time. My wife & I always enjoy the Southwestern Smoked Stew, afterwards we feast on Brontosaurus Beef Ribs with baked beans. The beef ribs & beans reminds me of another establishment that was here in the valley El Paso BBQ (no longer open). For the guys a nicely chilled tall mug of beer is a must also! Very consistent I highly recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"For approximately three years, I attended my submarine veterans meetings at Dillon's Restaurant - Arrowhead (20585 North 59th Avenue, Glendale, AZ 85308). The owners graciously supplied a private room for the use of my group, at no cost. In support of our military, they also allowed various veterans groups to decorate the room in a creative fashion. My lunch choice was always a hearty bowl of the Southwestern Smoked Stew, which consisted of shredded beef and pork, tomatoes, potatoes, carrots, peppers and corn in a zesty broth. This comfort food came with a dinner roll. The facility was quite roomy with a comfortable atmosphere. Parking was more than abundant, and the restaurant was easy to get to using several points of access. Thank you Dillon's for your heartfelt support of military veterans!"}
{"text":"Smoked salmon sandwich at Dillion's is killer...

Dillon's features 3 home made bbq sauces.... but the 'Sweet Heat' is my favorite !"}
{"text":"Kallie is awesome! Such an attentive friendly & knowledgeable server. 

1st time here. Seated in 5 minutes even though the parking lot was full... happy about that since we were starving. This place smells so good from down the street so I was thrilled! 

Ordered their app special 1/2 off mushroom bonanza. And they were alot & delish. More than enough for 3. Cooked to perfection.  Side of ranch & spicy ranch. 

Shared the Brontosaurus Ribs! Full Rack of beef ribs with 2 sides. Oh wow. So so tasty. Slow cooked for real!  Juicy! Meaty! Smothered! Got sweet sauce on but Kallie brought a side of spicy... and it was perfect. Mac n cheese was  creamy w crunchy edges. 

Everything was fresh & cooked to perfection. Definitely will come back & ask for Kallie!"}
{"text":"Went to Dillons yesterday (12 of November). They were protesting NFL by not playing football. We won't be back.  We love the Vets too. This protest is not about Vets. Service to this country is number one.  Taking a knee has nothing to do with that. It is about which story you want to believe... so believe what you want. We will eat some where else in the future."}
{"text":"I did a meeting in the back room here; the staff was super helpful in setting it up and making the event smooth and enjoyable for all involved. As for food I had the pulled chicken BBQ sandwich. It was  delicious. I would love to go back to try more foods! Everything on the table looked awesome!"}
{"text":"Service Sucked! Super SUCKED!  Barside, on a Wednesday night.  

Now that that is out of the way, I really liked the place.  The chica in the knee-highs ignoring our table was annoying, but the happy hour specials were good, the food was great, the atomsphere was fun and the facilities were clean.  What more can you ask for.  Oh and the drinks were a little pricey but good pours.  

We will be back, now that I know which server to watch out for."}
{"text":"Great for bbq, wings, chicken fried steak and happy hour! Large portions, great food."}
{"text":"Dillion's adds an additional 2.2% \"P206\" charge to your bill.  (This is addition to the regular sales tax on the bill).
Sorry, but I'm not letting them gouge me with their add-on costs. Not going there anymore."}
{"text":"You will find me here almost every Monday during football season.

The happy hour menu can't be beat. I always order the onion rings and the nachos. For the price it's a steal! The nacho plate is HUGE and can easily be split between 2 people. 

There are plenty of TV's and it's never too busy that you can't find a table to sit at in the bar.  The staff is always friendly and personable (it may help that I'm there every week). 

Thank you Dillon's for always being my \"go-to\" bar!"}
{"text":"I had dinner here last night with some coworkers. I was excited that they have a gluten free menu. Our server was Joshua, who was fabulous. He was knowledgeable, enthusiastic, attentive and pleasant. My coworkers ordered several fried appetizers, none of which I could have, being gluten free. They got fried mushrooms and onion rings which everyone said they enjoyed. They do have a spinach artichoke dip that is GF but I didn't want to order it just for myself. For dinner, I decided on the Burnt Ends Platter and asked for all three sauces (sweet, spice and Cajun). It comes with 2 sides, I opted for the cole slaw and veggie of the day (broccoli). The burnt ends were a bit disappointing and two coworkers also ordered this dish and had similar thoughts but we all agreed that the sauces were delicious. The cole slaw was tasty. They offer one gluten free dessert, which is the Vanilla Bean Brulee Cheesecake on an oat crust - the menu said it comes with blueberry sauce but they said they didn't have it and that it was glazed with caramel, which was just fine with me. I have to say the dessert made the whole meal for me, it was THAT wonderful. I would definitely go back and try a different dish next time. One coworker got the pulled pork and she raved about it."}
{"text":"Very nice staff. Excellent BBQ. My ribs were delicious! Tried all 3 sauces and loved all of them. It was expensive but worth it."}
{"text":"I came here last night with my wife because neither of us felt like cooking and we wanted to go somewhere new.

I had originally suggested The Pitts Again, however a friend of mine advised me to avoid them and come here instead. I'm glad he did.

The atmosphere felt casual, yet upscale. It was very comfortable. 

We started with the half order of onion rings - these have to be some of the best in the valley.

My wife ordered the margarita on special. Normally on the rocks margaritas have a strong taste like they weren't mixed well and are sometimes a bit too warm. In this case it was perfect.

I was surprised to see that they had angry orchard on tap so I ordered one of those.

She felt like fish and opted for the fish tacos. These were very well priced and very good. The flavor and cook of the fish was perfect. The coleslaw she and I had opted for on the side was also extremely good.

I ordered the brisket plate with slaw, a loaded baked potato and opted for the sweet heat sauce. It was divine. The sauce tastes sweet at first and then hits you with it's heat. The flavor is spot on.

The potato was cooked perfectly - but how can you screw up a potato? I was surprised with the twist I didn't expect - red onion. It was actually quite good.

The brisket itself was very well done and melted in my mouth. It was not dried out at all, just tender and delicious.

I am very glad we came here and will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Ordered a prime rib French dip. It was PITIFUL!!!! Barely any meat!!! Both the bread and the meat were VERY dry!!! The bread was hard!!! Even dipping it in the Au Jus didn't help!! Very disappointing!!! NEVER going back to this location!!! The Thunderbird location does a MUCH better job of preparing the food than this location!!!"}
{"text":"Dillans is my favorite BBQ place. My son, who just got back from KC, said Dillans BBQ is better! This location has a real neighborhood vibe...a good bar, great staff, and local bands on the the weekends."}
{"text":"Wednesday is Trivia Night and a blast! Bbq is so good! Best sandwich is the French Dip is the bomb.com. and the Beer is ice cold. One of my favorite places"}
{"text":"What a blast! The food was awesome. The service was great and the band was really fun!  Whatever you're doing keep doing it!"}
{"text":"Only been here for Happy Hour (2pm to 7pm everyday, I believe) and its only available in the Bar area, so sit there, or you wont get it. The food items available during HH definitely make it worth the trip. You need to locate the tiny HH food menu located on some (not all) of the tables disguised as advertisement for the other items they offer, or you could just ask your server to provide one.

My favorite item on it is the wings, although, 8 for $6 seems a bit pricey. On the plus side, though, they are usually pretty good sized.
The Bar has plenty of TV's playing just about any sport you follow. The service was adequate- in that she appeared just enough to satisfy our needs. She could have stopped by a little more, considering she was wearing a tight t-shirt proclaiming, \"NICE RACK\" (We agreed wholeheartedly! and \"yes\", I know, \"Men ARE pigs.\").
The bar area is a little dark, but then what bar isn't? Am I right? The seating was all High-tops or Bar stools (at least in the direction I was facing) so it may not be suitable for small children. On Friday's from 7pm to 11pm they have a different band playing from the advertisements I've seen on the walls.

I definitely need to go back here for the BBQ everyone raves about someday, but for now, I'll add them to my rotation of HH spots willingly."}
{"text":"Hailey is the best bartender ever, she's so cute and attenative. Thanks for making our visit memorable."}
{"text":"It's a click bar, if your a regular they treat you well, if you are not they do not give customer service.  The location on thunderbird welcomes all, 59th Not"}
{"text":"We have been here a couple of times and always enjoy it.  
I've had the smoked turkey twice and love it! Moist, smokey and tender--just wished they had a  spicy cranberry chutney for it.  I like the homestyle mashed potatoes and white gravy and the bbq beans are great with the right amount of heat. The burnt ends are great, too. 

My husband had the pulled pork platter and rated it as excellent. 

We shared the salted caramel vanilla cake with a custard between layers and loved it. Sharing was the right choice as it is rich. 

Our server was smiling, friendly and attentive. Drinks were refilled regularly. And our food arrived quickly.   We'll be back."}
{"text":"Pretty basic - pork drenched in BBQ. The fries were raw, but I'm happy to see that Dillon's has passed the minimum wage increase in AZ to its customers. Check the bottom of the receipt if you wanna punish yourself and eat here, you'll see P206 2.2%. That is some shady business..."}
{"text":"People usually comment about certain places saying they are going downhill as a negative review, I would say the same about Dillon's but that would imply they were on the hill to begin with. The food was terrible the service was terrible the environment is old and outdated and desperately needing a renovation. In the Phoenix metro area the restaurant business is extremely competitive and for this business to be stuck in time...it is a sign that they will not be around for long. If you want good barbecue try somewhere else."}
{"text":"Sauce variety is so so. Ribs are tiny, even for babybacks. Other meat accompaniments include brisket (too dry for me), pulled chicken, p[ulled pork, and smoked sausage. The waitress claimed they make the sausage on site but it tasted very generic, like it came out of a hillshire farms packet from costco. The steak fries were the only side I ate and they appeared to have some skin on them but still tasted so so. There is much better BBQ to be had in the NW Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Pulled pork sandwich was awesome, the sweet heat sauce was very good, staff was very friendly and helpful, only problem I seen was it was way too warm inside for being 105 outside... 

Prices were reasonable also."}
{"text":"I've been frequenting Dillon's for many years but it's been awhile since my last visit.
I remember they had the best onion rings. It had really thin and crunchy batter and came out really fresh. Today, I was little disappointed. It looks like they must've change the batter, much thicker and very doughy. I hope it was just an off day. We also ordered the salmon salad but came out really fishy and the salmon looked like it had some kind of coating on it. Maybe it was the cheese but didn't care for it. 
The catfish and mashed potatoes were the same as I remember it. They were very tasty. However, they must've changed their mac and cheese too. It was served with larger elbow pasta. 
The beef brisket quesadillas were really yummy. It had nice crunchy tortilla filled with lots of meat and cheese. 
Overall, service was excellent; however some of the dishes leaves a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place a chance but it was extremely difficult when our server made us feel like we're an incovinience. She was in a horrible mood, was bossy, never smiled, talked to us like we were stupid and wasn't very attentive unless she absolutely needed to be. Maybe she was having an off day but c'mon girl, fake it till you make it. It was one of those experiences where you don't want to ask for anything additional cause you don't want to piss them off even more than they already are. Overall total buzz kill. Thanks for killin my vibe, Hailey."}
{"text":"What's really sad is I posted this same review on Facebook and they just deleted it instead of reaching out and trying to explain why this happened........
Total disappointment for Thanksgiving Day. We were all so excited to go to Dillon's for Thanksgiving and avoid the all day long cooking and cleanup associated with a holiday feast. A party of 9 of us showed up for our 2:30 reservation, seated rather quickly only to find out the the BBQ Beef Brisket Platter half of us were waiting to enjoy was shelved from the menu per our waitress. Evidently the turkey wasn't as big of a seller as thought so we were told the brisket wasn't being served and we had to chose between the turkey or ham steak. Yet as you walk in, the Thanksgiving feast sign was still on display showing the menu choices including the brisket. Total shock after you order drinks and appetizers then go to order your dinner and find out what most people in your party want,Isn't being served. Very unprofessional and false advertising. Dillon's was always one of my go to places to eat but I don't know if I will be going back again. Happy Thanksgiving from Dillon's!"}
{"text":"Greeter was a very nice girl.

To go order girl was nice, but a little awkward.

Beef ribs were very tasty, but there wasn't as much meat on the bones as I am used to for beef ribs.  1 less start for volume of meat on bones.

Mashed potatoes and gravy was delicious.  

Stew soup was good as well.

This was my first time here. A deal was the reason I came.  I would go again."}
{"text":"THESE GUYS ARE THE BEST OF THE BEST!!! I visit Dillon's all the time, weekly for sure and sometime 2-3 times a week! Yes it's that great! 
You get delicious food, awesome service, reasonable prices and the Dillon's crew is oh so welcoming & friendly! 
I love you Rich, Heather & Joey!!! My favorite is the pulled pork sandwich & also the burnt ends with Cajun BBQ sauce, yummy! Plus they have nightly happy hour drink specials! Can't beat that, I've recommended this place to all my family & friends. They all love it too! Dillon's you rock! Thank you for coming to my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"What's up with the chili?!? Using hamburger now?? Don't go cheap. Why would you change something so dramatic?"}
{"text":"Our friend recommended the ribs, and after Yelping the area near her house, we could not come up with a better idea. Parking is at the back so you stroll around they ponds to the pretty front landscaped area which faces on to N 59th Ave, where a few hostesses are happily waiting to seat you. The place filled up quickly on a Thursday night. Dining tables are wrapped around the huge bar area, and there are lots of TV screens, but hey it is a sports bar. We were dressed to attend a classical concert, but nobody stared at us, and actually most people were dressed up although the decor is more down home casual to fit the tasty ribs slathered in BBQ sauce.
Since my husband ordered said ribs, Amber our friendly server, tied a bib on him that said \"I love pig butts and I can not lie\". He loved it and asked for an extra to take home. The ribs were delicious but what is listed as their hottest sauce tasted mild to his CA palette. On the other hand, I asked for the hottest sauce they had for my fish tacos (what is a nice pescatarian like me doing in a place like this? See above) and they delivered not only a nice salsa but a bowl of hot sauce that delivered a punch. 
I was happy with my three huge fish tacos plus a side of mashed potatoes and potato salad. You choose the sides from a list of about ten, and I like potatoes so what the heck. A Yelper recommended the potato salad, and it was very good. Fortunately Amber asked me which kind of gravy I wanted on my mashed potatoes, because I forgot that they do not mention the mashed potatoes automatically comes with gravy that I do not want, so I was able to stave off the gravy, and they remembered to exclude it on my order. 
We were rushed because we had to get to the concert, and our food order was late, so Amanda brought our bill early as we requested. I would eat here again, and give myself time to sip my sauvignon blanc and my husband could guzzle more of one of their many  beers on tap."}
{"text":"Amazing food, Amazing service, Amazing atmosphere!  Give them a try, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"So we have 3 younger kids. They gave each of our kids a tablet to play with before dinner with Disney and Dr. Seuss apps. I was shocked. I had the prime rib and it was outstanding. We love going here based on prices for our family of 6. Great desserts too."}
{"text":"Three in our party.  Very comfortable atmosphere. Courtney was our server. She was very kind went through menu with us. Made great recommendations. Two of us had pick two meats platter. Burnt ends and baby back ribs, mashed potatoes Mac n cheese and coke slaw. All excellent. Husband had hot beef on a French toast topped with large helping of mashed potatoes and Mac n cheese. Loved it too. This is going to be our new dinner place. Highly recommend."}
