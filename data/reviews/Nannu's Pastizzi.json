{"text":"Definitely worth the trip, found out about this place 2 days ago and has been obsessed with their food since. Tried Veal sandwich and chicken on the bun and they're amazing. Definitely the best I ever had in sauga. Their pastizzi however is not salty enough for me, but still taste ok. would definitely recommand to my coworkers. I will visit again!"}
{"text":"Tried a couple of pastries. They would have tasted fantastic if they were fresh. May be I visited at the wrong time ( 12:30 pm on a weekday) as the pastizzi was quite hard to bite on. The Portuguese tarts were fantastic..they didn't make the Nutella pastizzi that day so I just tried the custard ones together with some other treats"}
{"text":"Got the chicken on a bun, they charged extra for every condiments without warning , came up to 13$ with a drink.. Taste was okay"}
{"text":"We walked from our hotel to get a quick breakfast. Everything was fresh and delicious. They were out of chocolate croissants, but the owner was kind enough to take regular croissants and add some Nutella, drizzle with chocolate. My girls love them. He also  cut up two apples for us, not on the menu, but because we asked."}
{"text":"So so good we tried a bit of every thing The savoury pastizzis are uber crispy and flaky. There are so many sweets and unique cookies to choose from it is best to have a few adventurous friends along to help you enjoy the many, sometimes exotic flavors."}
{"text":"I really can't remember the name of what I had for breakfast there 4 days in a row.  Nannu's was suggested to me by the hotel concierge 2 blocks away and due to the great quality of the food and the friendly service I decided that it would be my breakfast spot every morning while in Mississagua.  I Look forward to my next visit to Missisagua."}
{"text":"After reading all the great review about this place, I finally made the time on a Saturday morning to drive down to Nannu's, I have to say I was very impressed with their customer service. I give them 5 stars for being polite, helpful and super friendly.  Now the \"Pastizzi\" It was really good, fresh and warm straight out of the oven, I had it with a cup of espresso for breakfast, and the combo was fantastic.  I also ordered half a dozen to go, 4 beef and peas, 2 cheese and a piece of home made brownie.  now I will  break it down for you guys:  Beef Pastizzi-3.5/5 (why ? it needed salt and little more seasoning) But it was good! Cheese Pastizzi- 2.5/5 ( why ? very bland! )  Brownie - 3.5/5 ( good, but nothing special )   In totality I gave them 4 stars, would I return? for sure!  because I believe this is this only authentic Maltese Pastizzi place in Mississauga and the Pastizzi's are decent."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! We got the maple latte and meat/peas pastizzi. They also had cheese pastizzi, but we decided not to get that. The latte was good and the pastizzi was out of this world. It was incredibly crunchy and flaky (you could see all the layers!) It wasn't overly thick so you're only eating the pastry - the ratio was good. And the filling was just perfectly flavored (as others mentioned, tasted a little bit like curry). They had other items in the store as well (various entrees and pastries). As we were leaving, we saw them being hand made in the back. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Wow what a nice restaurant I went in Nannu,s bakery today their pastizzi are the best if I could speak I would give chriss and his wife 100% of quality their pastizzi are the best from any where I went .Very friendly and they make you feel like family.I,m so glad my husband took me to Nannu,s bakery.this Place is so clean you can eat off the floor.I,m so happy to say my husband bought me some pastizzi frozen to take home I even cooked some more when I got home that evening I followed the instuctions and they came just the same from Nannu,s bakery.Thank you for the food and service that we purchased today well worth its an awesome bakery Irene and Angelo D."}
{"text":"Pate a choux on steriods remixed with the insides of a samosa. Don't dare tell me that doesn't sound good. Savory, crispy derishishness. The place is very well a hidden gem. I had an hour to kill while my daughter had a class nearby. The air entering the plaza was filled with the smell of fresh baked bread. I followed the smell like little Gretel (My mom was Hansel) and long behold a beautiful house filled with goodies. Thank goodness I didnt find a witch, only two sweet servers. I told them I wanted something pretty to drink so they made me a cappuccino. Heaven sent these girls we're, because now I'm going to have to be a regular. Fyi, so glad Summer is here, because nothing sounds better than a nice cup of Joe and a Pastizzi on a patio with pretty flowers ($1.50 Pastizzi + $3.50 Cappuccino = Happy Thao). The End.  July 11/5: Came in today to try the ricotta pastizzi, holy geeze its soooo good."}
{"text":"Great Pastizzi! GREAT hot bar and great family-owned service! Both the meat and cheese pastizzi are very tasty!"}
{"text":"I was searching something to have for Sat brunch and found Nannu's on Yelp. I had no idea what is Pastizzi before I step into this place! After the first bite, I have to say I am hooked! They have the meaty filling one and the cheese one. I personally love the cheese one better. The Pastizzi was so good so hubby and I decided to try other hot dishes. We had the veal on bun and the ravioli (recommended by the staff). They are good, but not as AMAZING as the Pastizzi. When we were eating, many regulars came in to order/pick up boxes and boxes of Pastizzi. I think I am gonna order the cheese Pastizzi for my next party! If you are in the area, give the Pastizzi a try! You will love it!!!!"}
{"text":"As far as I can tell, this is the only place in the GTA that sells Pastizzi. They have a cheese version and a curry meat version. It's basically a crispy layered shell with stuffing inside. In their display case they also sometimes have a dessert version with cream inside.  I liked the cheese one better than the curry meat one. The texture is just better. The meat one is mostly peas and the filling falls off easily. You can order frozen ones too and bake at home.   This place deserves 5 stars for its reasonable prices, and great taste. While the filling doesn't blow my mind, it's really the crispy shell that makes this so good. I can't recall when I've ever had such crispy pastry before. It used to be $1.50 each but even at $2 it's quite reasonable. Get 3 and it's a meal!  They also have a hot food section which I'll probably never get around to trying because their pastizzi is so good. It's a small place and caf√© style so don't expect service."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try Nannu's for the longest longest time and I'm so happy I have discovered this hidden gem.  So I went here during the lunch hours and decided to try their veal sandwich.And obviously their famous pastizzi.  So starting with veal sandwich it was made fresh and the portion was generous, I could only eat half.The sandwich was nothing extraordinary I find most Italian places make them similarly.You can add mushrooms, cheese, onions, peppers on the sandwich for an up charge.I was more excited to try their pastizzi which they are famous for.  So I ordered 2 cheese and 2 meat ones and boy  they really absolutely mind blowing.So freshly made, this flaky phyllo pastry which is crispy and thin from the outside and has a comforting filling of either cheese or corned beef with loads and curry in the inside is just phenomenal.The price is right too, it's $2 a piece for a decent size pastizzi.  This little restaurant is decent size and has about 6/8 tables.When I went there it was fairly packed since it was lunch hour.  There is ample amount of parking outside the restaurant.My only complaint is I wish they are better staffed, there was only one girl taking all the orders, running at the back, constructing sandwiches and also serving at the tables.Though she was doing a great job one more staff member would make this operation much faster and smoother.  Oh I forgot they also have a huge desert selection and I opted for a sticky bundt cake.I thoroughly enjoyed it.It was fresh and delish.  Will definitely be coming here again."}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp for helping us find this little gem.  The bae and I drove over on a lazy Sunday afternoon for a snack and enjoyed our time here. We ordered two cappucinos with cinnamon, and two pastizzi (one meat and one cheese). Both were absolutely delicious! My fave was the cheese version - it was served warm with a delicate flaky crust and cheesy goodness on the inside. OMG so so good!  We ended up also ordering a sweet as well. I forget the name but it was a pastry covered in chopped nuts and honey, so yummy!  The ladies working there were so friendly, we purchased a frozen timpana dinner for later that week. Timpana is a type of penne pasta dish with a meaty tomato sauce, topped with puff pastry - so delicious!  Can't wait to come back to Nannu's!"}
{"text":"Ok I've had all the pastizzis available in the GTA now and these guys are the tops.   Flakey and light with an airy filling that's as light as the pastry it's wrapped in.   They make everything by hand and they're always super friendly.   If you're in the area and have never tried a Maltese pastizzi I recommend you change that right now. Stop here and try a piece of the small country of Malta's most popular treat! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Service was fantastic! Such friendly people at Nannu's.   The interior was cozy and warm. Came at noon on a weekday and it wasn't very busy, so I was able to settle down with a mug of coffee and a ricotta pastizzi and enjoy the afternoon sun shining through the large windows.   The pastizzi was good, wasn't quite what I was expecting. It was a little too hard and chewy at the bottom, making it a bit difficult to chew through. Not sure if they're suppose to be like this, or if they just weren't as fresh. But it tasted delicious and was fully filled with ricotta."}
{"text":"Okkkkkkkk WHAT?! This is the place to be when you want your fix of a savoury curry/ cheese croissant type like pastry with a buttery layer and crispy outer! But it's not even close to a croissant! It's a Maltese dessert that you'll be craving for the rest of your life!  I know they sell other things than Pastizzi but I haven't tried any because I'm still obsessed with just stuffing myself full of pastizzi!   Come and try it for yourself! And get it while their fresh in the AM!! Eat the cheese pastizzi with coffee and have the curry pastizzi for lunch!   Now I'm craving it just thinking about it!"}
{"text":"I had no idea what Pastizzi was before coming to this place - after Googling what the heck it actually was, I came here on a Saturday morning for a quick morning snack. Basically, Pastizzi is like a really, really crunchy pseudo-wannabe-croissant (Maltese), not at all soft or sweet, but crispy and savoury.  Located in a plaza at the corner of Derry Road and Millcreek Drive in Northwest Mississauga, this is definitely a mom-and-pop shop where, if you peek into the kitchen, you can actually see Grandma and Grandpa rolling out the puff pastry and making batches and batches of these for the day. It's a very casual family environment, basic but charming.   We ordered 2 Pastizzi stuffed with warm ricotta cheese ($1.75 each), a coffee, and a tea.  Like others commented below - the pastry itself is super enjoyable. So crunchy yet light - the cheese stuffing was generous, nice and warm, and worked perfectly with the pastry shell. Overall, delicious! It was so crunchy and wonderful, and so difficult to only have just one! The coffee was fine; the tea comes from an average box of tea bags behind the counter - I'd pass on the tea next time. The Pastizzi was the highlight of our visit and, apparently their menu, as they sell other savoury flavours with various types of stuffing.  If we're ever in the area again, we'll definitely come back to cater to our newfound Pastizzi fix! Our total, with taxes in, came to exactly $8.00."}
{"text":"Great Pastizzi and service which stands head and shoulders above the Toronto Pastizzi bakeries.  It was a great environment and they have a patio as well.  This will definitely be a place we frequent."}
{"text":"I heard about this place a lot. The owners are extremely friendly and offer a cosy and warm environment. The flaky paste that is the outer covering of the pastizi  when baked is amazingly crispy. I wish I could just have one without any filling.  The cheese pastizi had too much cheese in it for my taste. And the other type is filled with corned beef, again not my first choice.  Hoping they would offer more variety like chicken cheese filling and any other innovative pastizi."}
{"text":"I drove to the other side of Mississauga to try the pastizzi---WORTH THE DRIVE!!! I tried one ricotta with cheese and meat with veggies and ordered more to take home.  Its a family operated business; I could see mom and dad working with great care in the kitchen and the person at the front (who I'm assuming is their daughter) was very pleasant and kind. Thanked me for my business--I will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"I first tried the pastizzis here about six months ago and recently had some again last week. They were just as delicious as I remember! I like the corn beef, peas and curry flavour - just the right amount of filling to compliment the crispy, flaky shell! The crispy croissant-like shell really is the star of these pastizzis and best enjoyed when it's right out of the oven. The pastizzis also come in a cheese flavour.  Pastizzis can be bought ready made in store or you can buy them frozen as well (party size and regular size). I bought a party size frozen pack last week (a dozen) and baked them according to the instructions - just as delicious as the in-store ones!  You can also find other baked goods like cannolis there, which are amazing by the way!They also have a selection of hot foods if you come early enough in the day. I'll definitely be going back when I'm in that part of Mississauga!"}
{"text":"Savoury, Maltese croissants?  YES, please!  I've had this place bookmarked for a while and decided to drop by while I was in the area.  (Otherwise, this place is definitely NOT in my 'hood!)  Anyway, I decided to get half a dozen pastizzis to-go, half ricotta/beef with peas (slight curry flavour).  Croissant isn't that accurate of a term to describe the pastry, but I'd say the consistency of sfogliatella/shell pastry:  thicker, crunchier, and denser.  Each pastizzis was $1.50, half a dozen - $7.50, and a dozen was $15 - but don't quote me 'cause I went last week.  The pastry was absolutely delectable and I think I enjoyed the outer shell more than I did the stuffing.  The ricotta was slightly salted, while although the beef/peas was good, I felt that it lacked a bit of flavour.  So the pastry was the absolute star of this snack-on-the-go!  If you're hankering for something a bit different/trying to elevate your tastes from subway beef patty, check this place out!    P.S.  They also had a hot table that I didn't quite get a chance to try!  ;)"}
{"text":"Absolutely adorable this place. It's family owned and operated.  The pastizzi is so delish and always fresh, they also have frozen pastizzi you can buy to take home and prepare yourself. I bought a bag of cheese and meat pastizzi for my bf as he's Maltese and he was amazed at how great they came out when he popped them in the oven himself.  During the valentine's day weekend I got Nutella pastizzi as well so delish!!! I can't forget about the customer service. Everyone there is so pleasent and social able. As soon as you walk in its a positive vibe. Everyone is happy to help and always smiling. I'll definitely be returning Thanks Nannu! !!!!!"}
{"text":"For a party, we ordered 5 dozen party sized pastizzi and holy cow, did this ever get incredible raves.  It is a dough that is like phyllo pastry .. crispy thin and the perfect layering surrounding soft pillows of hot molten cheese.  They do offer a meat option but I think our crowd was all about the gooey cheese.  All of them came quickly delivered and well packed.  All the pastizzi were perfectly made and still hot to the touch.  We also got a party sized pizza and the kids who werent too adventurous loved grabbing that.  I would say that the kids liked the pizza a lot but the parents and adventurous kids tore right into the pastizzi once they know how good they are.   It has a great crispy crunch and yet it isn't heavy though it full of great cheese inside.  We ordered them extra well done so it had more crunch to them.  Definitely worthwhile to try and you'll be quite happy to try something new and delicious."}
{"text":"I've been coming to the plaza for years (I work out at the Goodlife Fitness around the corner) but I've never noticed this place till today. I figured I would give it a shot, and I'm glad I did. It seems like a small, family owned cafe based on the friendly service. I got the veal on a bun (with cheese and mushrooms) and it was delicious. The bread was fresh, the veal as very tender and the toppings tasted fresh. I look forward to coming back again!"}
