{"text":"Very fun to go here for St. Patricks day festivities!They are smoke free now which is a a major plus!"}
{"text":"Stopped by there this afternoon.  Fun place! Very friendly staff and crowd.  The owner Bill is a very welcoming guy, he even bought me a draft.  That's hospitality!  I'll be back.  Thank you."}
{"text":"Best $1.00 pizza in Pittsburgh!!! On Tuesday ,   Very good white pizza also !!! Was in on a Sat and crazy good meatballs home made by Zac"}
{"text":"Friendly, cool little neighborhood bar.  Nothing fancy.  Comfortable, with a small beer selection and reasonably-priced pub food.  I really like Pub in the Park."}
{"text":"WAIT!!!  MUST EDIT - The kitchen was open until 12am the night we went (Thursday).  HUGE benefit.  Definitely a place to get a late night bite and head home.  Better than crappy Denny's or Eat N' Park by A MILE!!!!  DISCLAIMER - Our first visit was on Thursday Wing Night.  Considering they don't have seitan wings, probably not the best night to go for our first experience there.  Keep this in mind as you read my review.  We will be back, but this visit was \"eh\" for us.  The positive:  The food.  Although lacking in vegetarian options, there are a few.  I had the vegetarian sandwich with French fries.  Grilled veggies, hummus, goat cheese, on a soft pita.  It was very good!  My partner had a white pizza (flatbread) with tomatoes, spices, ricotta and pizza cheese.  Tasty as well.  For a pub, the food presentation was pretty nice.  The fries came out in a little basket, and the pizza wasn't just slapped haphazardly on a plate.  Definitely making a good first impression for a pub that took on a full menu.  Living so close, I wanted to like pub sooooo badly.  As you can see, the food was tasty (although lacking a bit in veggie options), but there were also drawbacks, which led to my 3 star review:  1.  Service was slow.  Again, wing night, and two large groups there.  However, even after the groups left, still REALLY slow.  Our waitress was quite nice, but it took a long time for beer and food. 2.  Ambience.  I realize its a pub, but I thought with a full menu, the place would be a little more spruced up.  I'm not downing it, considering I tend to frequent quite pretentious place (ugh!), but a flat tabletop would've been nice. 3.  Veggie options, as stated. 4.  Servers with beer knowledge, and/or, a beer list.  They actually had a decently tap list, with at least two locals (East End and Arsenal), and a small, but well stocked, cooler with bottles and cans.  However, if the servers know little about the beer, then furnish me with a list.  We didn't get to talk to the bartender though.  She probably knew more in the beer department.  Don't get me wrong, we will be back.  We definitely want to try the pasta night. The three stars is because I soooo wanted to love it, and really I just liked it."}
{"text":"Fun bar, but if you aren't a smoker be prepared for your eyes to burn and your clothes to stink like cigarettes when you leave!  The usual Miller, Coors, Bud beers are cheap. No food. Just drinks."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar - nothin' fancy.  Always have the baseball/hockey game on, good draft beer selection and a fridge of bottles of if you want to explore.  SMOKE FREE!  Check out their facebook page - lots of random events happening (karaoke, trivia nights, acoustic nights).  Mostly pretty quiet unless there's an event or karaoke -- then look out.  Sunday funday $1 tacos are awesome."}
{"text":"This is a great hidden neighborhood pub. We used to go there all the time for karaoke. I understand that they recently went smoke free. They have friendly service and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"This neighborhood corner pub is one of my favorite bars I have ever visited. And I go to a lot of bars! Some reasons for this are the crazy affordable drink specials, and it's always a positive experience when I make it here. The variety of drinks keeps me happy too. The bartenders provide excellent service which is very important! I hear the food is really good, but so far I have ended up here in the evenings and not hungry at that point. I sure wish I lived close by! I have to mention, the ladies' room is one of the cleanest I have ever seen, and love the little details they provide for us, down to the glowing LED light when you wash your hands!! One more thing, it's difficult to describe an ambiance, so if you want to know how great it is here, visit soon ;-)"}
{"text":"Good food, super friendly staff and clientele. We have been here a few times recently and enjoyed the atmosphere, service, and food (have tried the burgers, wings, sandwiches, and flatbread). The outdoor space is also nice for summertime. Will be back."}
{"text":"Nice little place in the corner. They have Deep Eddy Lemon Vodka, so a huge win for me. Good beer selection too. Outside deck. Great local bar to watch a game and good HH specials too!"}
{"text":"I attended a fundraiser here this past weekend for two local men who are currently serving in Afghanistan. I have also been here several times to drink and watch the hockey game. Every time I have had a wonderful experience, between the friendly bartenders and the great priced drinks. This weekend was especially nice with all the things they had going on to raise money. There were numerous raffle baskets, 50/50 drawings, door prize giveaways and catering from a local restaurant. I had a great time and would definitely recommend this place as a small, friendly neighborhood bar to catch a game or drinks with friends."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar! Neighborhood haunt that has continued to become a neighborhood destination. No smoking - good bar food!"}
{"text":"The BEST FOOD IN DA BURG! THE WINGS ARE TO DIE FOR. The employees & owners are the BEST. So nice, not like some owners, that think they are the SH**"}
{"text":"Great food!! Used to be able to smoke in here but that's not the case anymore.. which made this one of my new favorite places. Always have events going on which is great. Taylor and Zack are favorite bartenders."}
