{"text":"This is true Neapolitan pizza and it is great. A light coating of tomatoes, buffalo mozzarella, a few leaves of basil and olive oil. If you're into the stuffed crust, all meat, drowned in cheese \"pizza\" you usually get in this country, you will be disappointed. Italians would love this place. They're usually grossed out at our food, with good reason. If you want the real thing and don't want to go to Naples, this place is for you."}
{"text":"A gem in our neighborhood!  Stone can be funny. We've gone there to find them out of dough. That's right, a pizza place that runs out of dough.   That hasn't happened in some time, but it's part of the lore of Stone.   In short, brick oven pizzas cooked to that perfect edge of blistered and chewy, smoky deliciousness.  But the secret is to ask them to make up one of their sandwiches using the pizza dough. The reason I tried this is that they ran out sandwich rolls (see a trend here? Hilarious). Man is it just about the perfect sandwich. It makes Stone one of my favorite places   Other pluses, outdoor dining, nice people, good selection of bottled beers, good prices. Please go, we need them to stay open!"}
{"text":"Delicious brick oven pizza. Think Il Pizzaiolo but affordable! The Bianca and Margarita are excellent. They also serve beer including six packs to go."}
{"text":"Excellent and affordable neapolitan pizzas.  Had the margherita and the white.  The website prices are out of date (they have been raised slightly).  Overall very good place to go for lunch downtown."}
{"text":"Great portion sizes on the Caesar salad--you NEED to get buffalo mozz on the Margherita pizza. Makes a huge difference!"}
{"text":"Delicious! In reading reviews before heading in, we heard that the pizzas we on the small side so we ordered a small antipasto and two pizzas: Vesuvius and Margherita. The salad was very good. It had a good amount of toppings and was enough for two to share. The pizza's were great! The crust was light and airy and the sauce tasted freshly made. Would definitely return here and recommend to friends."}
{"text":"We were thrilled to find european-style pizza in Pittsburgh. We had the Antica salad piadini, which has argula, fresh mozzarella, and cherry tomatoes on a pizza crust. We both got the margherita pizza. Everything was amazing (!), and the prices are what you would pay in europe. I highly recommend this restaurant, a bit  off the beaten path- next to the Wyndham Hotel. Best pizza we've had in a long time. Forget the fancy restaurants. If you want good pizza, go here."}
{"text":"Hands down, best pizza that I have ever had, which is why I frequent this place often.  Much different than your run-of-the-mill large cheese and pepperoni pizzas, but that's what makes this place so intriguing.  Everything from the dough, cheese, and sauce, to all of the toppings and bread is undoubtably fresh and prepared daily. Great, laid-back atmosphere; friendly, fast service; and the prices are more than affordable (a pizza and a drink will run you less than $10!). Also, this place has quite the beer selection to meet anyone's taste and preference.  Keep doing what you're doing, Stone."}
{"text":"Great service. Pizza not so good. I'd rather get pizza from pizza Parma. The brick oven pizza from the market district giant eagles are even better.  I really wanted to like this place. My wife and I will not return."}
{"text":"The Bianca al prosciutto with arugula and shaved reggiano was soo good. The crust was thin and not overdone. Just the right amount of garlic, no tomato sauce. My friend had the turkey and cheese with all the toppings on fresh warm bread. Outdoor seating. Inexpensive and right next door to the Wyndham Grand."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend for their Restaurant Week 2 pizzas + 1 Salad for $20 special (basically getting the salad for free and even a slight discount on the two pizzas). Pizza was served quick and is a delicious thin crust style. Even though this is basically a counter-order style place service was still good and friendly. Also sells beer and location is good, right across from the Point."}
{"text":"Food is brick oven style. Pretty good. Portions are tiny for anything other than pizza, prices are too high. Wait is long, especially on a Friday when they should be staffed more. 45+ for a pizza. Had an unpleasant experience ordering my food:  Customer: Can I have a chicken Caesar salad?  Employee: We don't have chicken! (Condescendingly)  Customer: Ok, well you have 20+ toppings and your menu is written in chalk and the salad section is all smudged."}
{"text":"Stone provides a rare pizza experience in Pittsburgh. It serves wood fired pizzas in the Neapoltian pizza style. The pizza is much more like that in Italy (more saucy, less cheese). It's a refreshing experience in comparison to the late-night greasy pizza joints. The 'custom' Margherita  pizza with mushrooms and artichokes tasted great. The only con is that the pizzas are a bit small. Good enough for a light meal or lunch but if you want something more you may have to stop elsewhere for dessert."}
{"text":"Good, neapolitan style pizza and good beer selection. While Il Pizzaiolo is the closest that I've come to the pizza in Naples, Stone makes a very good pizza with similar characteristics. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Best Pizza I have ever had!  I have got quite a few pies at stone neapolitan.  I like to mix and match everything.  I usually chose to build my own.  My specialty is the Margherita pizza with a chili sauce pepperoni, sausage, and pancetta.  I highly recommend it to anyone in working downtown, going to pirate or steeler games or any event in the city!"}
{"text":"Trusted the Yelp Reviews, tried it out. Not very good pizza, crust was burned, that about sums it up. I wouldn't NOT recommend eating here, but keep your expectations in check and you'll be fine."}
{"text":"The melancholy when your childhood favorite finally gets bested. It's thrilling but heartbreaking and Stone is that for me--the Burgh's new #1, ending Aiello's 15 year reign.  It's not the decor or service that does it--Aiello's cramped fluorescent \"dining room\" and stacked pizza boxes have more charm, and so do the jibes you get from the jokers working there. By comparison, Stone's cafeteria service and decor is as bland as the clean metal tables and transparent as the glass walls. Doesn't help that it was empty on Friday at happy hour.  But Stone has beer, and even if it's only Peroni we all know that's a winning combo. And Stone's pizza is just better, plain and simple. The perfect crust is charred well and chewy. The four cheese steals the show, plenty of gorgonzola. It's a white pizza unfortunately, so eat fast or it'll dry out, but it'll stay hot the whole time--sauce cools first. The proscuitto and funghi is another winner and all ingredients work. Meat is definitely fresh and the crust again rocks. More sauce to improve it.  The city of champs has a new champ."}
{"text":"My wife is 3rd generation NY Italian who grew up about a block from John's pizza in the village. We lived in Pittsburgh since about 1997.  We eat pizza about once a week and we have tried out most pizza places in the city.   Stones is truly excellent. They make everything from scratch.  When you see the fresh mozzarella being made each morning and taste it on the very very good Capri salad you know the chief cares.  The pizza is a perfect Neapolitan style pie of just the right size.  It really is very close to the best pizza we have had in Naples Italy.    Stones is a gem."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good charred crust. Quattro Formaggi had perfect blend of cheeses. Margarita was very good. Place gets some wind whipping through opposing doors."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Great atmosphere. Great service. When we make it back to Pittsburg, we will definitely be back for more delicious pizza!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved their pizza. You can create and customize everything about it, and they have so many options to choose from. The serving size was perfect! I ordered a margherita, with the chili oil or olive oil (can't remember), cotto, green pepper, red pepper, kalamata olives, and basil. It was fantastic. The atmosphere was really chill as well which made it a really nice place to go. I was very happy with the decision to eat there. There is a parking garage nearby which can make transportation easy, but I walked from where I was staying at the Omni. I'm definitely going back soon."}
{"text":"I got the margarita pizza. It was slightly burnt, but still good. Establishment is a bit pricey. Recommend not going if you are looking for a quick lunch. Service isn't super fast, but the pizza is made fresh."}
{"text":"Staying at the Wyndham across the street. Yelped restaurants in the area and this was the closest one and with great reviews so I decided to try it. I'm glad I did. Staff was super nice and friendly and food was great. I got the Margarita Extra Pizza with a beer. The crust was crispy but yet chewy and the sauce and cheese was great. It was nice and light. Ended up returning for dinner. Got the Torino sandwich.  It was made with their freshly cooked pizza dough!!!!yummy!! The sandwich is huge. Could only eat half. I recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"A margherita at Stone runs $6.35.  Six dollars and thirty-five cents for a bona fide Neapolitan pie.  For your reference, a Tombstone is $4.99.  So for as little as $1.36 you can upgrade from the unfathomable frozen abyss to life-affirming pizza glory.  My only gripe is location. It's a great lunch spot but as much as I love the pizza I never think to come for dinner since it's not really on the way to or from anywhere except the Point.  That said, if they ever open a 2nd location (please come to the east end!), there is no reason to go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype is here, the flavor of my pizza (margarita extra) was pretty good- however except for a one inch diameter around the crust, it was as soggy as a wet kitchen sponge! I may have understood if it was hastily cooked due to a lunch 'rush' but there was hardly a person in the place when I ordered and no one in line behind me. When you pick up a slice of  pizza it shouldn't droop and drip! Please pay some attention to quality."}
{"text":"Excellent spot for a quick bite. We ordered a Margherita pizza and it was freshly made and baked in the wood stove oven. They also serve beer. Good service and great value."}
{"text":"Superb service!  Friendly people serving good food at reasonable prices.  A co-worker bought a groupon here, and we had a great lunch for not much $$$.  We split a large salad, each had a 9-inch margarita pizza, and a drink.  Pizza was good, if only a little simple.  Definitely a nice place for a quick lunch downtown.  From most of downtown, walk down Liberty Ave towards Point State Park, it will be in the base of the River Vue Building(Old State Building) across from the Wyndham(Old Hilton)."}
{"text":"Nice pizza with fresh toppings. I ordered a veggie pizza and loved it. The dough was just right, tangy sauce and just the proper amount of toppings. They were a little light on the oil ($3 extra). For next visit, I recommend proactively asking for the oil on the side or ensuring that it is on it. Highly recommend this place for lunch!"}
{"text":"Stayed at Wyndham across the street stopped here for lunch we got the torino sandwich  and it was amazing. They use their tasty pizza crust as a bun and the meats are top notch and vegies fresh. Loved it, great staff."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Sunday afternoon and the place was pretty empty. Service was great but limited menu on weekends for some reason. Love the char on the crust from the wood burning oven. Just had a couple of margarita pizzas and a salad. No gluten free crusts available."}
{"text":"This place has all the allure of bar pizza, but in a posh downtown location.  We went on a Saturday for lunch, and split a garden salad and a Margarita pizza.  The pizza is perfect to share for lunch.  If we were going for dinner, I would probably get one just for myself.  Full disclaimer - they ask if you have been there before and if you are new they show you a pan and tell you \"all the pizzas come in this size\".  The restaurant has a great smell thanks to the wood fired oven that bakes the pizzas.  The crust was good!  Chewy, a little blackened, but not overcooked.  And it was either of the sourdough variety, or flavored well enough to convince me that it was.  They also had a case full of bottled beer with some IPA's, and a few domestics.  The dining room wasn't the cleanest I have been in, and it was a little stuffy.  No doubt from that hot oven.  And you have to get a key from the counter to use the restroom.  Which, given their proximity to the park, I completely understand.  But it take s a little away from the otherwise hip atmosphere."}
{"text":"Good pizza in casual venues is such a rarity in the mediocre pizza-infested city of Pittsburgh. Stone, however, achieves a perfect pizza-for-one. The crust is thin and light and grease is non-existent. They also maintain a very cool and modern ambiance with unique wall art and great music. Considering how busy they often get due to large crowds from the hotel across the street, the service is fast and efficient."}
{"text":"Decent lunch spot for fresh made pizzas. A tad pricey for what you get, but good every now and then."}
{"text":"The pizza was soggy in the middle and some of my pepperoni weren't cooked. The flavors were good, just not how I expect oven fired pizza to be. Salad and dressing were decent. The staff is nice."}
{"text":"Food took 45 minutes, though they told us 20. They were out of just about everything, so we ended up with something we didn't really want, and it was mediocre at best. Tables weren't cleaned in the 45 minutes we were there. No wonder other people were asking for refunds."}
{"text":"Omg. Finally! 3rd times the charm! One of the best pizzas. I've come before and it was soup on a piece of flatbread with amazing taste. Now. Phenomenal! Price amazing. Pizza amazing. Gotta go here! :)"}
{"text":"I had the Quattro white cheese pizza and man was it fabulous! I liked the interior and loved watching him make my pizza from scratch! I would suggest a different method for getting the orders to the tables because remembering which pizza went to which table seemed an issue for the cashier but other than that it was a great experience! :)"}
{"text":"Inexpensive neapolitan pizza done right. A margherita pizza is around 7-8 dollars for an 8 inch although the prices will escalate if you add toppings which is almost half of what I could get in Pizza. I can't believe how quiet this place was on a Monday early evening but it may just be the lack of general traffic in the Gateway area at that time. I'm guessing this is more of a lunch place given that it is on the first floor of an office building.  The crust was cooked just right with the right amount of doughy consistency and the tell tell ashy spots that usually comes out of a coal oven. The sauce was nicely tart mixing well with the dobs of mozzarella."}
{"text":"Real deal Neapolitan pizza, the wood-fired oven looks great! 6.35 $ for a basic margherita pizza that has good char, some smokey flavor in the chewy dough, a great basic tomato sauce---its a winner!  If the pizza bottom was just a tad bit more crispy, it would be gold. Nice soda selections, perfect place to relax after a stroll in the Point."}
{"text":"Great little pizza place right in the middle of town!  I stopped down with some co-workers a few weeks ago to grab lunch and was pleasantly surprised by how nice the restaurant was.  The design is modern and clean and the glass windows all around give a great view of the rivers and the city.  After deciding what we'd like for lunch, the cashier took our orders on an iPad and said it would be about 5 minutes.  As promised, the pizza was ready in five minutes and was boxed up for us to take back to work.    The quality is consistent and the ingredients were very high quality.  I ordered a simple margherita pizza, but there are a ton of options for various toppings, most of which are authentic italian and would not even be available at most pizza places.  All of the veggies and meats were also extremely fresh.  The pizza was a decent size and had a very crisp crust on the edges, but was softer in the middle of the pizza.  The sauce had a very light and fresh flavor and the cheese was perfect.  I will say, that I probably could have eaten another half pizza, but this may be due to the fact that I didn't load up on toppings.  Next time I go, I will be sure to order a side or get some toppings in order to make a larger meal.  The only other restaurant downtown that I can really compare it to would be Wingharts as they also have wood-fired / brick oven pizza on the menu.  I would have to say that Winghart's pizza is larger and has more toppings, but doesn't have the authentic itialian feel that Stone has.  While I love both shops, and they both have great pizza, they are very different in style.  Overall, the quality of the food was amazing, the service was fast and friendly and the location is extremely convenient for anyone working near the point.  I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Stone is one of my favorite pizza places. I've never understood why Stone hasn't gotten much recognition or attention as far as pizza joints go.  In my opinion, it is quite underrated and it truly deserves more attention from my fellow foodies.  Stone isn't just any old pizza place; it serves up Neapolitan style pizza, which is cooked in a wood-fired oven.  The restaurant is nestled right under the Rivervue apartments facing Point State Park.  One of the things I love about this place is that it has a super casual atmosphere: you order, take a number, pick a table, and they bring your food out based on your number.  They don't ask for tips, although you might feel like you should because the employees do an incredible job of making you feel welcome.  Pizza is not the only thing on the menu, Stone also has an array of sandwiches and salads.  They even have a small selection of craft beer.  And you want to know the best thing about this place? The price.  Compared to its local competitors, Stone's pizzas are a fraction of the price with most being in the single digit range.  A margherita will cost you $7.35 as compared to $15 at Il Pizzaiolo up the street.  Granted, you are paying for a different atmosphere at Il Pizzaiolo that you wouldn't find at Stone, it's still good to know that there is a cheaper, more casual, option should you feel like scoring a discount for a high quality pie.  Stone uses ingredients sourced right from the Strip District and the freshness is evident immediately upon first bite.  They've mastered the perfect crust with the perfect balance of crunchy and chewy and the slightest bit of char and smokiness from the wood-fired oven. The flavor of the crust is mild, which allows the freshness of the other ingredients and toppings to really shine. This way, you can really enjoy each flavor element of your pie as opposed to having an overwhelmingly salty crust, like other places I've tried.  The sauce is simple and made in-house, but it adds the perfect tang and sweetness. When topped with creamy melted fresh mozzarella and minty basil leaves, you've got yourself an incredible combination of fresh flavors.    PS. I love that they carry \"Dirty\" chips because I don't know many places that do."}
{"text":"So cheap. So delicious. Expect to wait a bit longer than your average slice because your pizza is being stone oven baked fresh to order! I can't believe that a pizza that costs at least twice as much at a sit down restaurant was this cheap, and the service was extremely friendly. Loved it, will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Went here because of the 4.5 rating. Crust = 3/5 (chewy but super thin), toppings = 3/5 (Bianca was 5/5), service = 5/5. Approx $10 for a 13\" pie. It's probably an expensive location to rent but I wouldn't recommend my friends to go out of their way for the experience"}
{"text":"The Italian pizza it is for sure. The wood burn oven gives the real Italian taste of their food. Love it  It's a shame they don't have dessert menu yet otherwise I would've given them 5 stars."}
{"text":"Fast, casual place downtown that has awesome pizzas.  Indoor and outdoor seating, great bottled beer selection and a brick oven to cook these pizzas. All fresh ingredients and toppings.  A great find when everything else downtown was booked. It was random but I will revisit often."}
{"text":"A convenient, quick and delicious lunch option in the business district. Brick oven pizzas and super affordable prices will fill you up and leave a few slices for a second meal. The service is quick and the restaurant is very clean / well maintained."}
{"text":"Crust on the pizza is delicious! I usually go with the Vesuvius (spicy) or a make your own. Also, the bread on the Venice sandwhich is light and fluffy on the side, crunchy on the outside. Sometimes you will need to call ahead to see if they still have dough left if it is a busy day or there are things going on downtown."}
{"text":"Had a Groupon, decided to go before the expiration date. This is one of those occurrences where I wish Yelp would let me leave half stars, because I'd totally give Stone Neopolitan Pizza 4.5/5 stars. The pizza was delicious... I'd never had a margherita pizza before and was horrified to see that there are blobs ofcheese on the sauce instead of all cheesy because I hate tomatoes in 99% of circumstances. However, eeverything was fresh and the balance between sauce and cheese was perfect. And the crust was great as well. The size of the pizza was just right, leaving me full but not stuffed and uncomfortable.   I have to dock Stone 1 star because the salad wasn't the greatest. My boyfriend didn't think there was enough dressing and I found a few pieces of lettuce with the reddish brown sign of aging on the sides. It was a pizza place salad - less than excellence is to be expected, but it keeps Stone from a perfect score.   I'd like to come back, but as of right now I have no reason to go to downtown Pittsburgh. Probably next time it pops up on Groupon."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Pittsburgh! The two most important ingredients in pizza: the crust and the tomato sauce are perfect. The crust is thin and crunchy and the tomato sauce is delicious. All ingredients are high quality and fresh. I highly recommend this pizzeria to everyone!"}
{"text":"Mediocre wood-fired pizza. Extremely slow. Terrible cashier when I visited. Short on staff. Tables were left unbussed for a long time. Overall atmosphere felt somewhat unclean. Somewhat overpriced for quality and quantity."}
{"text":"Stopped in here the other day, got the quattro formaggi pizza and added pepperoni, because...pepperoni. The pie was good, the crust was a lot softer and chewier than I expected, which was a good thing. They didn't skimp out on the pepperoni or the cheese, which is awesome. The price was decent. I will be back, good spot."}
{"text":"I like Stone...  don't get me wrong.  Compared to other Neapolitan pizza joints, this place is a steal.  It doesn't get too busy during the typical downtown lunch hours, and they have enough groupons/living social deals (2 pizzas, salad, & 2 drinks for $12) that you could build a small fortress with them.  The food itself is simple, and that's a good thing.  The pizzas have a good chewy crust and the ingredients that they use are decent.  Where Stone falls short, is surprising service.  I'm hoping it was just a new girl at the register, but when we went last time, I found not one, but two hairs in my pizza.  When I went up to the cashier to let them know, she more or less panicked, didn't know what to do, and didn't offer up anything but an awkward, \"we hope you still come back.\"  It's predicaments like these that cause me to have too many love/hate relationships with restaurants in this city.  One time I go, and the service is impeccable and the food is out of this world.  The next, and the service is non-existent and the food is alright at best.  I'll give it another shot.  I understand things like this happen (to be honest, it usually doesn't phase me).  But when it does, addressing it in the correct manner goes a long way."}
{"text":"Great wood oven pie! Some of the best dough/crust ever.  Exceptional flavor profile.  Fresh salad, get the champagne vinaigrette.  We will return!"}
{"text":"I like.   I've been here a dozen times or more. It's quick (for made-zero-order pizza) and easy.   This is true, Neapolitan style. Very thin crust, thin as a tortilla, but flexible and a bit stretchy. The tomato sauce is basic, perhaps not real special (and that keeps me from going five stars) but it's still good.  They are also fairly small, and due to the thin dough, these pizzas are fine for one person.   The cheese is great, especially the fresh mozzarella on the margherita pizza.    The salads are good, too, and big enough to share."}
{"text":"It seems like this place might be a bit of a hidden gem.  I met a friend here before a show with a $20 gift certificate.  I'm guessing they probably do more business during the weekday lunch hours given their downtown location as we were the only diners on this particular evening.  The menu offers several options that all sound very tasty.  We had a difficult time deciding what to order but we finally agreed on sharing the caprese salad and bianca al prosciutto pizza.    Both our salad and pizza were very satisfying, not too heavy.  I love fresh ingredients on an imperfectly shaped crust with just the right amount of crunch.  Stone nails it."}
{"text":"Great stop for a quick and heart lunch. $35 for three adults and two kids. Great deal for a nice lunch."}
{"text":"Don't get the pizza.   That may be strange, considering they put \"pizzeria\" in the name, but trust me on this one. Go to Stone not for the pizza, but for the delicious sandwiches. They are top notch. The bread is baked in same coal fired oven as the pizzas and it comes out perfect every time.   Sandwiches. Trust me."}
{"text":"Looked to my Yelp buddies for a good pizza place to grab a late nite pie. And as usual they nailed it!  Thin crust made to perfection, fresh mozzarella, great service. They were helpful in explaining what everything was on the menu. Most definitely a recommended place to stop and get some pizza."}
{"text":"We ate there probably two times, nothing impressive but we didn't have a bad experience neither. It is different to what I was expecting. They do have some pre-grouped pizza and make you own pizza. The dough was great, source is alright, topping is ok. Maybe I am not sure what is Neapolitan pizza but since I heard that this is authentic but it is different from the regular pizza that I have had before at some other places. I am not saying it is bad but it is definitely different and not my taste. I have had some regular pizza and some modern pizza that is more creative. I would suggest people know what is Neapolitan pizza style before they go there. We got some sandwich too and they were pretty good! Looks like they made the sandwich bread from the pizza dough. I do like that how they made everything fresh in house."}
{"text":"Kind of reminds me of some of the \" quick service restaurants\" like Panera that try to do better than your typical fast food at a reasonable price.  That said, it's cheaper than Proper or Il Piazziolo but also not up to their standard.  Pizzas were adequate size and tasted good, but once you start throwing on toppings it's really not all that much cheaper than the others that I mentioned.  I suggest sticking with regular pizza if you are looking to save a few bucks and then treating yourself to one of those when you are ready to splurge."}
{"text":"Great stone oven pizza. delicious tomato sauce, perfect mozz cheese, we added proscuitto ontop which just made it that much better.  Small personal pies, but worth the price.  Best Pizza ive had in the burgh so far."}
{"text":"When it comes to Neapolitan pizza Stone nails it! The pizzas are fresh, baked quickly in their wood fired oven, and topped with high quality, delicious toppings. My go to pizza has been the prosciutto e funghi (prosciutto and mushroom).   When ordering I would advise one pizza per person; I can usually eat a whole one on my own. A pizza and an iced tea will run you about $10-12."}
{"text":"This is just a kick-ass little lunch spot. The rare downtown joint with relatively easy-to-get street parking, this place has the trifecta  -- great food, great service, and a few bottled beers that I like (there's just something about Peroni, I don't know). I split a prosciutto and mushroom pizza with my wife, which at about $10 is perfect for two. It came out quickly and had the perfect thin, crispy crust you can only really get with a wood-fired oven. With plentiful seating and tons of topping options, there are no minuses in this food equation. Only skip it if you hate pizza and/or happiness."}
{"text":"Pizza was pretty good, especially if you like the Wood/Baked taste. Would have given 4 stars if the service and wait wasn't so horrendous.  45 MINUTE wait for a Plain Pizza at LUNCH when you need food to be prepared in under 10 minutes is just no acceptable.  If u want to eat here I highly recommend calling ahead.  Disappointed,  RM"}
{"text":"I came here tonight with a few friends before seeing a musical at the Benedum.  I'd been wanting to try this place, and given the value and quality of food, it fit the bill perfectly!  I ordered the margherita extra pizza ($9.99), and it looked very nice when it came out of the oven.  The flavor was superb--the ingredients were clearly high-quality, including buffalo mozzarella and flavorful, not-too-sweet sauce, and fragrant basil leaves.  For most of the pie, the crust was crispy and well-cooked with touches of char on the edges.  However, my one complaint about this pizza was that it was too soggy for my liking in the middle, even after I'd waited a few minutes to remove a slice.  Ideally, I would prefer the crust to be crispy from the first bite, though I understand this effect can be hard to achieve with this type of pizza.* One friend ordered the Del Cafone, since she doesn't care for sauce on her pizza, and was very satisfied with it.  Another friend ordered the Vesuvius, and also enjoyed it, though he found it very spicy--and he grew up in Latin America and has lived in S.E. Asia, so he's no stranger to spicy food.  Based on his experience, I'd only recommend ordering this pie if you have a high tolerance for heat!  Service was friendly and efficient.  The decor is sleek and minimalist, though the pieces of firewood between the windows were a nice touch.  Since it was a pleasant evening, we took advantage of the plentiful outdoor seating and enjoyed a great view of downtown PGH and Point State Park while enjoying our pizza.  As we were leaving, we saw a truck drop off a pile of firewood by the back door for the pizza oven, which I noticed is imported from Italy.  I only noticed this after I'd already placed and paid for my order, but if you check in via the Yelp app, they offer a 10% discount.  I'll keep this in store for when I return!  *EDIT: On a subsequent visit, I ordered the quattro formaggi pizza and it didn't have the sogginess issue in the middle that the margherita pizza had, so this issue is clearly due to the marinara sauce."}
{"text":"Being that I had two friends visiting me from out of the country and that it was a beautiful Saturday in the city, amidst lots of hustle and bustle with the Arts Festival, I was looking for a good local place with outdoor seating and simple food.  This place came up on Yelp, and with some zig-zagging through downtown towards the Point, we finally stumbled upon it.  We were all pleased to see a wood fired oven right there behind the ordering area, and we each quickly decided on pizzas and a caprese plate.  The concept is fast-casual, like Panera Bread, in that you are given a number and you food is brought out to you.  I liked this concept because we were all pretty hungry by the time we got here.  Unfortunately, they seemed to be a bit behind it, as we waited well over 20-25 minutes for our food.  I'll grant that making a fresh pizza from scratch isn't exactly a 10 minute ordeal, but it seems that the production is not set up to serve a lot of people quickly, seeing as it looked like there was only one oven and one or maybe two people running the food to the tables.  When we did get it, however, it was absolutely delicious!  Nice thin and chewy crust with perfect ingredients.  We sat outside so that we could people-watch, which was lovely.  I would come back, but definitely under the circumstances of having plenty of time to spare and not being murderously hungry."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a bite and a brew while on my way to the Arts Festival and WOW -hello margherita pizza!  Might be one of the best I've ever had.  The crust....oh the crust.....is so fine and baked to deliciousness....    I'll be baaaaaaaaaack!"}
{"text":"I love Stone for lunch downtown.  It's off the beaten path and has a wonderful shady patio.  The interior is pleasant.  Most of all I love their pizza!  I usually get the margherita.  The price is reasonable (for instance il pizziaola in market square is much more expensive)."}
{"text":"Great pizza place! I would've liked to see more of the fancy toppings on the pizza... don't hold back! Thin crust, good cheese, made on the spot fresh off the oven... no complaints. They do Apple Pay as well."}
{"text":"Hey, how come I'd never heard of this lace before?  I mean I've only been working Downtown for the past 13 years!  Anyway, Stone Neapolitan Pizzeria has a bit of an odd layout and it's decor is -uh- different.  The floor to ceiling windows provide a great view of Point State Park and much of the decor is made from recycled materials.  I went for the Genoa Sandwich (mortadella, salami & cheese).   The mozzerella is homemade and it sure tastes like it.  Plus the other ingredients were very fresh---no freezers or tubs here!    It's too bad I work at the other end of Downtown and I don't normally head this way.  But if I do, I'm gonna try the pizza next time."}
{"text":"Excellent deal on the margarita pizza, only $7.35. Nice ingredient  and cooked well in the stone oven. Staff is very friendly as well!"}
{"text":"I'm always on the lookout for great wood fire pizza. This is it. Simple, flavorful, great range of toppings, nice beer selection, and an excellent location next to the Point as well."}
{"text":"Rick and Sara are awesome. I worked a 13 hour day. I was tired, stinky, and cranky. Rick and Sara helped me pick out local brews to drink with my mushroom pepperoni pizza. Pizza was superb, crisp thin crust, mello sauce but perfectly fresh, crispy pepperoni, fresh basil, and mushrooms. We were coming up on close and he didn't kick me out. In fact, quite the opposite, he changed the channel on the TV for me. Great place, and locals were coming in the whole time. Five stars for beer selection, service, and great grub."}
{"text":"A decent place to grab a pizza for lunch. These pizzas are made in a pizza oven and are quite good. They are on the other hand a bit small so just getting a pizza may not be enough to fill you up. The pizza quality was pretty good for a quick lunch but being that I live in Europe I would not say that it's amazing quality."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, awesome food, casual ambiance. Genuine brick oven pizza... Yum! Fresh basil & olive oil, and a perfect thin crust. Loved it!"}
{"text":"The pizza is amazing and the price is somehow even better...my friend and I got margherita pizzas for take out and they were less than $7 each for a perfect portion. Kind of in a weird spot downtown but that shouldn't take away from how good it was! Don't let the price lead you to think you're getting a low quality pizza. I'll definitely be back for take out again."}
{"text":"Maybe it's just because my two-year-old daughter and I shared a pizza outside here on a beautiful day, but this was my favorite pizza experience in Pittsburgh. We shared the Quattro Formaggi pie, which was delivered to our table quickly since it only took 90 seconds to cook! Incredibly tasty everything and it was the perfect size for us. The availability of alcohol (in my case, a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale) made the lunch even better. Definitely recommended if you're around Point State Park."}
{"text":"I absolutely love mortadella bologna and their Genoa mortadella and salami sandwich is simply delish! Great selections of toppings to choose from. Love the choice of adding fresh mozzarella. Haven't yet had their pizza, but it looks fantastic. Will be back."}
{"text":"Great little unsuspecting pizza place!  My boo bought a Groupon here the other day (really just based on the photo and the proximity to our work/home) and we decided we just can't let a pizza place in Pittsburgh (alliteration, anyone?) untouched. We were in for a pleasant surprise - the food was delicious, the service was prompt, and the ambiance trendy. They seemed to be fairly new, which worked to our advantage since they were extra attentive. We ordered a margherita pizza each and I was even able to snag a San Pelligrino blood orange soda (my favorite)!  They had seating both outside and inside and it was pretty dead when we went. The wall-size pop art style mural livened up the interior and the whole feel was super fun, modern, and clean. Our pizzas arrived lightning fast and our attentive server was concerned because they were a *little* blackened, thus bringing out an extra pie for us! Prices here are reasonable - a standard personal pie is about $9-15, depending on the toppings. I wish I could've had the time to try their salads and desserts, which all looked pretty tasty. I definitely have to stop by here again next time I'm dahntahn!"}
{"text":"I go here because the owner is super nice (not to mention super handsome). He always comes outside to greet my dogs who are, by the way, permitted to dine on the patio. The pizza smells divinely (and my friends give it raving reviews), but I don't do cheese; so the owner always goes overboard to concoct the most amazing of vegan salads for me. He created the oven with his own bare hands, and that makes this dining experience just seem so perfectly Italian. Perfect spot for an informal lunch or late night snack."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  Husband went in hours earlier to get a pizza. We thought the crust was bland and overdone.   We went to a festival nearby and on the way to the parking garage I stopped in to use the restroom .  The doors were locked . A worker on the way out of a men's room assumed I was nt a customer and said they were for customers   Then I went to the front counter to let a key. A woman told me the restrooms were just for customers. I said we had bought a pizza earlier   She said \" I wasnt here then\"   Maybe they have issues due to the area , but I won't even step foot in there to even buy a Coke . How rude of them!"}
{"text":"Pizza has little flavor even with all the toppings (prosciutto bianco with ricotta). Crust was so thin it was soft from the ingredients instead of crispy.  The crust was undercooked and almost raw inside.  I'm not sure why this place is getting the reviews it is, but this is no where near real Neapolitan pizza and it's a crime this place refers to the home of pizza in its name because it is a bad example of the most popular food in the world.  Don't bother if your in the area b/c there has to be a better choice!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Delicious, authentic, and not pretentious! Order at the counter and your pie comes to your table in a few minutes. Everything about this place is great. I drive into town from the suburbs just to eat here."}
{"text":"We went in a cold December Sunday and had the place to ourselves. I guess that most of their business comes from the nearby office buildings, which are closed on Sunday.  The pizzas are served in a personal size with options of pre-selected combos of toppings or you can build your own.  We opted for a pepperoni pie and enjoyed it. The crust was not too doughy and had a nice texture to it. The sauce was mild, not too sweet or hot. Overall , a satisfying pie"}
{"text":"Came here for a casual lunch on a Friday afternoon after taking the red eye in from San Francisco.   They have a 'build your own' pizza concept. You choose your sauce, oil and toppings. They make their pizza dough in house and the toppings are super fresh. I ended up ordering a pizza with marinara, caramelized onions, kalamata olives, basil, mushrooms, and white truffle oil. It was delicious!  The service was fast and the place is clean. I'd come here again for a quick bite if I'm craving pizza."}
{"text":"The reviews are great, but my experience at Stone Neapolitan was not.  My friend was staying in the Grand Wyndham, and we were trying to find somewhere inexpensive for dinner.  Stone Neapolitan does not have much competition on this front.  Most places are lunch only or way overpriced.  So we came here.  We were the only people in the place, and we both ordered margherita pizzas.  The pizzas looked amazing, but the crust was raw on the insides.  The center was cold and completely raw.  I only ate one slice of pizza, and I took the rest home.  I tried to eat more at one point, but I ended up just throwing the pizza away.  It was not appetizing.  Maybe it was just a bad night, but this pizza did not work for me."}
{"text":"I am a pizza nut, a fanatic. I melted the broiler in my oven trying to get it super hot to make better pizza. I still remember when it exploded into flames and thinking how fortunate it was that the pizza was just about done anyway. Enough. This is the first pizza place that has impressed me....ever! The attention to simplicity and great ingredients is stunning. Super fine Italian flour, real moz, and a wood fired oven create wonderful pies with magnificent leoparding (tiny blackened spots on the crust). The staff, and owner Rick, are super friendly and know how to turn out exceptional pizzas with crisp light crust. If you are a Pizza Hut fan don't bother; They don't serve meat lover pizzas.  Go at least once to see what a slice of real pizza, made by real experts, tastes like."}
{"text":"I was roaming the street of Pittsburgh and came across this place. I'm glad I listen to my stomach and stop! You have the option of certain pizza and if you feel adventurous, then you can create your own personalize pizza! They have a variety of different topping, sauces, oils, and more. The options are abundant, so it's up to your taste buds!  The staff are friendly and helpful.  They really made the experience enjoyable. The pizza is good!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this and this I was running dahntahn figures I'd stop in and try a pie. Was greeted promptly and ordered my prosciutto fungi pizza. It was a quick wait perhaps 6-8 minutes and was on my way. Definitely  it your typical saucy doughy pizza so was a pleasant change. Thin crust and light on the sauce but plenty of toppings makes this an easy pizza to indulge with minimal guilt. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Stone is a little place in the bottom of a new apartment complex downtown, where the old State offices use to be.    I went with a friend on two different occasions, because I purchased the Groupon.  The Groupon deal allowed for us to share a salad, each get a Margarhita pizza and each have a drink.  I upgraded my pizza with additional greens.  It was tasty both times.  I love the semi-charred taste of the crust.  The crust is also a thin crust, which is also a fave of mine.  The decor inside is modern and it has a good location for a relaxing lunch.    I highly suggest Stone for a leisurely or quick lunch downtown!"}
{"text":"Like El Pizzaiolo with the brick oven pizzas at about half the price. I would highly recommend trying just the plain one."}
{"text":"Margarita pizza with artichoke and red peppers, really good, try it.  Fresh, flavorful, I would drive 30 minutes and come back again."}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a try as I was at the three rivers arts festival and looking to skip some long lines for overpriced food at the tents. I would say going to Stone was the better decision. However, I was a bit mislead when I chose the marinara sauce that said \"no cheese\" on the menu on the wall and also no mention of cheese on the smaller menu inside--and opened my box to a pizza with cheese. I guess this is just assumed, but I do not eat cheese and felt that this could be better specified.   If I am ever back here, I will remember to skip the oil option. my pizza was completely soaked in garlic oil. I tried to absorb some of it with a napkin, but it merely soaked the paper as it was an endless amount of it.  I'm happy to say that they did make me another pizza because of the cheese misunderstanding. But just why have literally \"no cheese\" on the menu if the pizza ends up with cheese? it just doesn't seem logical.   3 stars because the staff was patient and respectful. plus after attempting to drain my pizza of its personal oil factory, it didn't taste too bad"}
{"text":"Great pizza and beer selection! You can taste the wood fire stove and quality ingredients. The only thing keeping this from 5 stars is a slight wait."}
{"text":"The pizza can't save the terrible attitudes of every miserable person who works here. I asked for a bathroom key and was told the bathrooms are for paying customers only...by the guy who brought me my pizza 5 minutes earlier. Skip this one!"}
{"text":"Pizza was ok, really nothing out of this world. I ordered a prosciutto pizza and it had a green color rather than the normal dark purple color. Also, the girl who took my order made me question whether I wanted to eat there at all. She looked like she just got out of a party that went on all night, her eye make up was running and she was sweating, not to mention the fact that she wasn't understanding what I was telling her (I wanted two different pizzas, nothing difficult). It's obvious that nobody mentioned to her that she needed to clean up a bit as her physical appearance was not presentable to customers and I  certainly would like to think she didn't make my pizza. Nevertheless, keep walking, I'm sure there are way better pizza restaurants in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"It pains me to have to write a negative review about this place as I've always thought their pizza is comparable to Il Pizzaiolo.  I really enjoy the pizza at both of these places and Stone is definitely priced better, but alas, customer service is a big part of dining out and they were off the charts in the wrong direction!  Ok so the most recent service my boyfriend and I experienced was awful.  We decided to grab some dinner here before heading to a show at the Benedum.  The bf had to use the bathroom and we were told it was for paying customers only - makes sense and we told them we'll be putting in an order.  The guy behind the counter said that the men's bathroom was currently being used since the bathroom key wasn't there.   Ok fine - we'll wait until the men's key is returned.  5-10 minutes later, which I feel is a reasonable amount of time to wait, we asked if the bf could just use the women's bathroom given that they have a locked bathroom policy (he drank a lot of water before heading here).  The guy behind the counter seemed fine with it but looked to who I presume was the owner who told us that he couldn't do that.  What?!?  What can't you do, give us the women's key which appears to be available since you have the key behind the counter and we had already put in our pizza order so at this point we are paying customers.  The owner proceeds to tell us that there may be women in the bathroom so he's uncomfortable giving a man the key to the women's bathroom.  Ok this doesn't make sense, b/c if it's a locked bathroom policy and they have the women's key with them, isn't it safe to assume that the women's bathroom is locked and not being used.  And if that's the case, can you give a dude a break who needs to take a whizz - he'll be 5 seconds and out of there in no time.    This is what we reasoned with the owner, but he refused to give in saying that sometimes it's not locked...Uh ok, then why do you have a key to the women's bathroom and a supposed locked bathroom policy?!?!  So we sat down at our table waiting for our pizza, and the bf was seething (I was annoyed as well) about the nonsensical argument that took place.    At this point it's about 25 minutes later, and we didn't see a man come out of the men's bathroom.  I'm thinking the establishment should be concerned with whoever is in there b/c that's a damn long time to be in a public bathroom (unless something has gone terribly wrong).    We're basically done with our pizza and all around it was a miserable experience given that the bf was uncomfortable the entire time we were here.  Then auto-magically a woman worker behind the counter hands us the key to the men's bathroom that appears to have been behind the counter THE ENTIRE TIME!  WOW - talk about some shitty service and the staff not paying any attention nor having any concern for a customer who needs to use the facilities.    A few things, we were 100% certain that no man ever exited the men's bathroom so the men's key had been with the staff the entire time.  There were plenty of times that the women's bathroom wasn't being used during the 30-40 minutes we were there where the bf could have popped in and quickly used it.  There were no apologies from the owner.  I was in total shock about the way the handled a seemingly easy customer request.  Needless to say, I doubt that I'll ever go here again after this experience.  Yes folks - it was that awful.  I may like their pizza but I'll pay a few more bucks and head over to Il Piz...at least there I know they won't be bathroom Nazis!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch on Good Friday so we did not get to sample any pizzas with meat.  However, we ordered two margherita extra, two quattro formaggi and we created our own pie: margherita, chili oil, carmelized onions, cherry tomatoes, green pepper & argula.  The margherita extra was awesome.  I really enjoyed the olive oil they use.  The quattro formaggi was tasty, next time i would maybe add something spicy to it.  And the pizza we created was the best.  Thanks to the staff for suggesting the chili oil.  All the pizzas have a nice well done crust and are soft & chewy towards the middle.  That style might not suit everyone, but works well for me.  A few other notes: They have a bunch of craft beers, yay; service is fast, so its a great spot for a weekday lunch; for those visiting there was some street metered parking around the building as well as a parking garage ($20)."}
{"text":"My wife and I grabbed a pizza here during the arts festival and I was impressed with it very much.    They offer a great selection of toppings beyond the standard fare of pepperoni and sausage, to include items such as FRESH mozzarella.       If you are looking for a nice upscale pizza place that is beyond your standard greasy local spots (though they have their charms at the right time) then check this place out."}
{"text":"Bummed!  Sounded so great, but for whatever reason, this pizza place was \"sold out of dough!\"  What pizza place does that?!"}
{"text":"This is based on a single visit; I had a Caesar salad and Margherita pizza. The salad was good, not great but certainly good enough. It was just slightly bland for my taste. That didn't stop me from eating the whole thing though.   The pizza: awesome.  A nice \"crunchy on the outside and fluffy on the inside\" crust, with just a slight char that only a real oven can give you. No conveyor belt here. Great sauce and cheese, just the right amount of both. In particular, not too much cheese. You can eat this and not feel like you've got a few bricks along for the ride in your gut. Wonderful. I ate the whole thing here, too. Go ahead, call me a pig. I can take it. Oink!  Regarding another review that mentioned uncooked dough and cold sauce: this is a fairly watery sauce on a pretty thin crust that is cooked very quickly. I did notice some soggy dough near the center of the pizza. I was looking for it based on that review. It wasn't undercooked, but rather just got a bit waterlogged after coming out of the oven. Without a cheese blanket on top of it the sauce cooled quickly, particularly in the cool room (it's winter/spring and the room was...cool). Some might not like this and that's understandable; I found it acceptable given the type of pizza. Your opinion and/or experience might differ!  Finally, everyone was very kind. Can't forget the peeps!"}
{"text":"Good fresh ingredients. Good fresh pizza. I like this place. It was a cool location. I won't go out of my way, but if I was in town, then this restaurant would be on my list of choices to eat."}
{"text":"Hands down some of the best pizza I've ever had.  I made my own pizza with their garlic oil, arugula, artichoke hearts, and kalmata olives and it was to die for.  The prices aren't bad, and we didn't wait long at all for the pizza's to come out.  I'll definitely be going back to try more combinations that'll be just as tasty.  Oh, and the girl working behind the counter was so sweet!"}
{"text":"Girlfriend and I came in for dinner- the pizza was just about immaculate. Perfect crunch, perfect sauce one pizza is about 10 inches across, which is nice for a personal pizza. A bit saucy but that was perfect for my tastes. Caprese salad was awesome as well. Overall great restaurant!"}
{"text":"Incredible pizza!   Finally this city which has at least one pizza joint on every corner has a pizzeria downtown that serves amazing pizza.  Hand stretched dough that ready in minutes and is so delicious and fresh.  Perfect size for a lunch portion and very reasonable prices.  Huge selection of toppings.  The bianca with chili oil is delicious with any topping, the margherita is also great with a nice tomato sauce and fresh mozzeralla and basil.  Very friendly staff.  I don't normally eat a lot of pizza, but I could eat here every day!"}
{"text":"Bought a groupon for this place on a pizza craving whim since the reviews were so good.  We went on a Wednesday evening and as expected the place was deserted.  I think its mostly a lunch place for the downtown folks which is probably a better experience since at 9 pm the place went from empty to crowded with somewhat shady clientele.    A wide variety of toppings, at a dollar or more each (yum, proscuitto!).  The salad we had can only be described as...LIMP.  The pizzas a bit too crispy and too thick a crust for my liking.  Overall a ho-hum pizza place to me, I probably won't be spending non-groupon money here in the future."}
{"text":"Was in town visiting and stopped by Stone's after visiting Point State Park. This place was excellent! The service was great and the employees were exceptionally friendly. My boyfriend and I ordered the Margarita pizza and we made one of our own. It was cooked exactly how a wood fired pizza should be. Fresh, hot, and tasty! Would definitely recommend this place to anyone in the area who is on the go."}
{"text":"We had a really good experience at Stone. I'd say there are literally only two downsides...the first is parking, and the second is a restaurant layout issue, though not a real problem for our visit during a slower time. The former is what it is...you're not likely to get a spot that's close to the restaurant, but that can be said for most downtown places. The latter issue is simply where the robust wall menu is located in relation to where we ordered. Still not a huge issue...unless it's packed. Then I could see it being tough to order from.  I liked how the idea was setup, though. You pick your crust, your sauce, your topping, etc. It's a fully customizable experience, and it's reasonably-priced.  I got the caprese salad, which was good, and I like the lack of pretentiousness with everything served on pizza trays, a la Fiori's style. The pizza was perfectly cooked. A lot of these neapolitan pizza places that are popping up struggle to cook the center of the pizza so it's not soggy without overcooking the outside of the crust. Our pizzas were perfectly done, though!   We kept it simple on our visit, but overall the nice service, fair prices, and delicious pizzas make Stone a place worth checking out if you're downtown and have a craving for pizza that won't leave you feeling miserably full of grease. The owner (I'm assuming based on his interaction with guests while making pizzas) was really nice and outgoing, and you could tell he was really interested in what people thought. That mentality will help Stone stick around. I just worry about location."}
{"text":"I had their margarita pizza and it was very yummy. It was a nice clean restaurant and its really a gem in downtown. I appreciate that everything was fresh. During lunch time it can get pretty busy so go early."}
{"text":"Growing up in the land of authenticity pizza made me very picky about pizzas. Stone has legitimately good pizza! I'd totally recommend this placed for price and pizza quality. Location can be improved thought"}
{"text":"delicious pizza place owned by a young couple (i think) with a knack for flavor pairing and ingredient selection. the crust does not let a pizza aficionado down: It's doughy inside and crispy outside, not burnt but slightly blackened by the handbuilt woodfired oven in the kitchen. they have a predictably varied beer selection, though nothing on tap (i don't think) and they had gotten rid of their wine menu (or at least they didn't have wine at the end of March when I was there). i felt sad when i went twice and each time i was one of only two customers. here's hoping pittsburgh residents and visitors will give this place the love it deserves."}
{"text":"Wow. Great pizza in Pittsburgh. Fresh everything made fast by hand and cooked in 90 seconds in a real Italian wood fired oven. This place is not pretentious at all. Pure Pittsburgh dining room with traditional real Italian pizza taste. I have been to Italy and this is as good as theirs. You have to try it for sure. Then take a stroll through Point Park for fresh air and great views."}
{"text":"It's right across the street from the Wyndham that I unfortunately have to stay at while I travel to Pittsburgh.  Check-in for a 10% discount. The pizzas are thin and have a light amount of sauce and cheese, but they do have a good taste.  I have only been here for lunch.  The prices are reasonable. I saw lots of people eating salads and subs but never had them."}
{"text":"Popped over here for lunch on a Saturday. You have the option of ordering a pre-fixed pizza, or create your own. You order and pay at the counter and then they bring your pizza to you. I had to margarita and I burnt my mouth several times b/c I couldn't wait to eat it. It's so delicious. They use super fresh ingredients and the sauce has great seasoning. The crust gets the perfect amount of crispiness.  They do have a little outside seating that overlooks the point, which is really nice.  The staff here is really friendly and makes great recommendations.  I will definitely be back for more delicious pizza."}
{"text":"This pizza is perfect if you're not looking for heavy, greasy food. The crust was thin and the perfect mix of fluffy yet crispy. I had the classic margherita pizza, and it was wonderful. I'm a small person, and I ate the entire thing because it was so fresh. The cheese was delicious, and the sauce was too. However, my sauce was a little cold for the rest of the pizza. That's my only complaint. The inside is nice, but not a ton of seating. Overall, it's a nice place to grab food in the city at a decent price."}
{"text":"Great if you're looking for a non greasy pizza for dinner. I can't remember the exact name of the one we ordered but it was the third one on the list and it started with a B. Cut into 4 slices. So if you're hoping to put away a lot of pizza... probably not the best option."}
{"text":"This is a good place for lunch. Nothing fancy. Atmosphere is simple and clean. Food and service were good. Had the margarita pizza which was fresh and flavorful."}
{"text":"I'd say the quality of ingredients here are near the qualities of Piccolo Forno in Lawrenceville and Dinette in Shadyside/East Liberty. Personally, I liked the flavors from Piccolo's and Dinette's ovens more, but char flavor is obviously a matter of personal preference. Lastly, I found Stone's crust to be too soft. The toppings fell off the tip of each slice as I lifted it.  Stone has a significantly less romantic atmosphere than the other two brick oven pizzerias I have been comparing it too. It's better to take your family (with kids) here. I also think it's a good spot to grab a bite before or after a game (depending on the season). Also, I liked that Stone carriers about 10 options of bottled craft beer."}
{"text":"The pizza crust bottoms of both pies we ordered were undercooked. We ordered 2 speciality pizzas - the prosciutto de fungi was runny/watery from the sauce and had little flavor.  The prosciutto Bianco was tasteless as well. Very disappointed after reading multiple reviews that set different expectations."}
{"text":"First visit, great Caesar side salad, 12\" pizza (garlic oil, roasted red peppers, sausage and ricotta and regffiano cheese) in wood oven and drink.  $15. Fast service, will be back."}
{"text":"I scored Rolling Stones concert tickets earlier today... 18 rows back from the stage! What better way to celebrate than to get a pizza at \"Stone\", right?   Individual pizzas are made to order here at Stone Neapolitan; I'd say they're about 9 or 10 inches in diameter. You wouldn't find individual slices here. My sausage and pepperoni margherita pie came to an even $10.   It took about 15 minutes to get my pie. When it came it was pre-sliced into quarters and once I picked a slice up I was surprised at how greasy and soggy the crust was. I mean after reading all of the positive reviews for Stone on this site, I was somewhat disappointed. The actual taste of the pizza was yummy but I was expecting so much better from a crust that was cooked in a wood fire oven. I hope Mick Jagger and Keith Richards hold up better than the crust at Stone Neapolitan."}
{"text":"Nice, high quality Neapolitan pizza at a fair price. Excellent crust, great margherita. The food makes it worth dealing with the difficulty of parking downtown. My only qualms were the hot sausage, which tasted far too strongly of paprika, and the busing. With the number of tables and rate of service, this place is crying out for self-busing stations, a la Chipotle or just about every other non-table service restaurant in existence. All said, strongly recommended."}
{"text":"Finally, really good pizza Downtown. The Margherita has a thin, chewy crust which holds a thin layer of tomato sauce, some fresh basil leaves and fresh mozzarella. Not too much, not too little, not too greasy, not too dry. Add the tang of wood smoke and a little char and it's hard to beat. Very friendly staff and fast service. This is fast food that tastes like it took a lot longer. The portions are decent and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"All around good wood fired pizza but not the best I've had. Vesuvius pizza not spicy like the guy at the register said, even with added red pepper. Beer and wine on hold pending approval for now."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Pizzeria in Pittsburgh. I lived in River Vue and always used to order the pizza and sandwiches form this place.  I recommend Caprese Sandwich (my Fav) and Margherita Pizza."}
{"text":"Way over priced!! Paid $24 for 2 supposed pizzas which were nothing but dough. Margherita Extra was $1 more than online menu price and had a pink tint due to lack of tomatoes. About 3 leaves of basil all shifted on one side of pie! Prosciutto e Funghi  was $3.25 OVER online menu price...had NO mushrooms and the few slivers of prosciutto all on one side of pie!! Called back to note that total order was over $4 more than online menu price. Simply told that the printed menus in the restaurant had the current pricing. Very good reason that on a busy Saturday night downtown Pittsburgh, no one in the place even with their prime location. A couple years since I had visited this restaurant, and now I certainly know better!"}
{"text":"I walked into a fairly empty room grant it that it was almost three pm. The place is very spacious and very simple- reminded me of the Mexican place-chipotle interior. I went to the counter/cash register and ordered the margherita pizza with extra basil. I sat down next to the window and did not wait any longer than 15 min for my small pizza to come out. It had a soft red tomato sauce with mozerella chunks/slices with tons of basil on top. The sauce was killer- I don't think it came a can because the flavor was softer and not too salty. Reminded me of a very similar pizza I have had at mercurios.  Definitely recommend for a quick bite for good food!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a cold cloudy day and was promptly greeted.  As others have stated, Stone has large windows overlooking the Point State Park entrance and the Fort Pitt Bridge.  Probably great on a sunny day, but this day.   Nice to have Neapolitan style pizza which is available at a few places but not many downtown.   Stone has a list of specialty pizza with some fresh ingredients or build your own.  So many combinations, you could eat @ Stone every day for a year and probably not have every variety.    There are salads and sandwiches available too.    I split the Vesuvius pizza with a friend. The pizza is a little small..four cutes probably good for one person,  but it was more than I wanted and worked out well as we split it.    Really a good flavorful pizza."}
{"text":"Stone is another gem in the crown of my recent wood fired pizza fetish. It's a great new pizzeria (a year old) in the heart of a burgeoning downtown. I swear there was no reason to come here a few years ago. I went with the margheria. The fresh mozzerella, basil, olive oil, and house-made marinara were all made from ingredients purchased locally at Penn-Mac (you have to go there), and they were all perfect. But the king was the crust. Freshly made and tossed right in front of us, and fire baked in a flash. The whole thing was made from scratch and on my table in about 8 minutes. The crust was simple, but very flavorful. The texture was crisp, but it didn't cut my mouth. The edges were chewy and bubbly.   The best part: this 10\"+ (probably more like 11\" or 12\") was $6.50. Holy sheeeeit. They could have reasonably charged $10 for this masterpiece. Seriously, I would have happily paid that."}
{"text":"Really nice little place with great pizza and friendly staff. It's sit-down in the same way that Chipotle is sit-down. They serve wine and beer, but maybe I'm just not used to that in a non-table-service establishement.  Unlike Osteria 100, the pizzas are a good size for lunch. The first time I went, a friend and I split a Ceasar salad and a Vesuvius pizza. Portions were fine for a light lunch. The second time I had one pizza myself.   The dough quality is excellent - thin, toasted on the edges, and soft within. The taste is so fresh - much like Il Pizziaolo in Mt Lebo.  I've since had the Quattro Formaggi and the Prosciutto y Fungi and both were great.  This is a great addition to the downtown lunch scene. I hope they do well - the location is on the very edge of town - and nice to see that they are open past 3pm. Would be a cool happy hour place if they had a bar, but there's just no room for one. With the right wine list it would be kind of like having Dinette minutes from my office.  Two downsides: 1. Noise! It's all hard surfaces, so conversations travel. In their defense, it's all glass on two sides, so no much you can do there. 2. THere is no vestibule, so on wintry days there are big chills rushing in with every patron. One of those demountable canvas vestibules like they use in NYC would help a lot."}
{"text":"I had no idea Stone has been around for nearly 5 years! This pizza joint is in a superb location (literally steps away from point state park). I think the oven they use to prepare the pizzas produces a high quality dough that nearly recapitulates the chew, toast, and texture of the dough in Naples, Italy. It's probably the closest thing you will find in Pittsburgh to Neopolitan pizza. The only thing that is slightly off is that the dough seemed a bit more closed texture possibly due to the low turnover at the time I was dining there.   I think their pizzas are not quite as satisfying as those at Proper Brick if you're looking for pizza downtown, but they clock in at just half the price. Similarly, you can't beat the outdoor seating views on a summer evening."}
{"text":"Have been coming to this place since it opened.  When the Three Rivers Arts Festival is going on at the nearby park, rather than purchase food at the expensive festival food stands, would just come here, order a pizza Margherita for take out and eat it back at the festival. And with the bicycle river trails nearby, made a point of stopping here for a pizza every time I went out with friends on a bike ride.  Tried all the wood-oven fired pizzas in town:  Mercurio's, Piccolo Forno, Bread & Salt, Pizzaiolo, City Oven.  This one here beats 'em all on price:  less than $7 for a Margherita.  oh, and btw, they do have craft beer bottles and San Pellegrino orange soda."}
{"text":"I was pleased with my meal, but not totally blown away like I am when I go down the street to Il Pizzaiolo in Market Square. I ordered the Prosciutto e Funghi pizza and had plenty of both prosciutto and mushrooms. The crust was thin and the sauce was good. Maybe it's the wood fired oven, but I don't like any burned edges to my pizza....perhaps that's how some people like it. I've eaten pizza in Naples and don't recall burned edges.   I felt like it was unclear where to order. The chalkboard menu was half erased when I walked in and it's not very close to where you order at the register. I thought it might be a sit-down place, but turns out it's not. I ate outside and had a lovely view of Point State Park and nice planters of flowers. The wait staff checked on me several times and I appreciated that.   I might go back, I might not. For me it doesn't really matter either way."}
{"text":"Across the street from the Wyndham Grand hotel and worth the quick trip. $7 for a personal margarita pizza. The wood fired oven blackened the crust slightly to give it a great taste. Definitely a good, quick bite option."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why everyone loves this place so much. It isn't awful but there are way better options after all its Pizza every block has one. The pizza costs more than the average and is smaller. The dough is a little thin around the middle but it has the amazing stone oven taste. That unique charred crisp that is just perfect. The crust is very doughy which I liked, but I'm just not sure it's worth the extra money.   I did like the location, being in such close proximity to market square and the point. And the outdoor eatery was very nice. Really the facility was well maintained and cleaned. They sell beer which is nice but it's predictably not the best selection and all bottled. I would try it again and probably will at some point but I think this place is over hyped."}
{"text":"This place has amazing pizza. The wood fire oven makes the dough perfect. It adds a perfect, yet delicate crunch. We had a Margherita pizza with buffalo mozzarella and a marina pizza with pepperoni. The pepperoni had an amazing flavor and crunch.  We loved this pizzeria!  Nice job y'all!!"}
{"text":"We tried the Margherta pizza. It was delicious. The crust is thin and light and cooked to perfection in a wood fired oven."}
{"text":"I had a very nice dinning experience.  They do a pretty nice job trying to recreate the pizza in the style of pizza served in naples. The quality of the pizza is solid and very resonably priced for the product your are getting. It is clear that the put a good bit of care into their pizzas.    I think this is a perfect example of the kind of places pittsburgh needs. The restaurant is unpretenscioius and they focus on doing one thing in a very good way. I hope to go back many times"}
{"text":"I definitely burned the roof of my mouth. I was just so excited to eat my margarita pizza (with mushrooms)! The crust was thin, the sauce was plentiful and the cheese was melty. A perfect combo in my book! I'm not sure if it's supposed to be saucy for Neapolitan pizza, but I kinda liked it that way.   I like that they offer beer and wine as well. I especially love those little cups you get your wine in. It matches the aesthetic more than getting them in an actually wine glass. It will be nice once they open the patio, where you'll get a prime spot to people watch and have a view of Point State Park. I can definitely see myself sitting outside on a warm night enjoying some 'za and wine!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch when I was in town for the Intel International Science & Engineering Fair. Excellent pizza, made to order. Great, fresh tomato taste. Friendly staff!"}
