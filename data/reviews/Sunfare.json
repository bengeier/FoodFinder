{"text":"My boyfriend and I just signed up for the vegetarian meals a little over a week ago and Sunfare has exceeded our expectations. My boyfriend isn't even vegetarian but he has loved every meal he has eaten and has told me everyday how awesome his meals taste. Just today he texted me while he was at work about his lunch \"oh my god just ate the stuffed portabella mushroom was absolutely incredible\". He had the \"mixed seafood grill\" several nights ago but he is still talking about how great it was and that he wants it again. I looked at my menu for the month (which is the same as his obvs) and Sunfare never serves you the same meal again in one month. I told him he gets another seafood grill next month and he replied \"oh that's so long\" so that gives you an indication of how good the food is.  He is definitely surprised that eating vegetarian could be so satisfying and told me that he doesn't miss eating meat at all and actually feels better eating this way.  I have been pescaterian for about 8 years so I was thrilled that with the vegetarian meals they still serve you fish. I didn't even mention to Sunfare that I ate fish so I was really pleased that they incorporate fish into the vegetarian plan.  I have contacted my counselor Alyssa a couple of times and she has responded promptly. When I asked questions Alyssa answered them thoroughly. I'm pleased with the customer service I've received.  The portions are perfect so I always feel satisfied not stuffed and lethargic.  We are satisfied customers!"}
{"text":"It always feels good to compliment the businesses that are amazing...and Sunfare is just that.  Back in March 2012 I decided enough was enough and I was going to take off 20lbs....not that it was going to be easy.  I ran 5.5 miles every day, weight trained twice a week, and stuck with my sunfare meal plan (1100-1300 calories) five days a week.  I reached my goal for my 35th birthday in June and really do attribute 80% of it to my diet.    I have now moved to the Bay Area where Sunfare is unavailable and tried the Fresh Diet but it really does not compare to the quality of Sunfare. Although I am always skeptical of media reports, I do have to say that Sunfare does have wonderful food that makes you feel that you are not on a diet....I ordered pizza, brownies (sugar free, the best I ever had) and quesadillas which made me happy.   I have been able to keep off the pounds by understanding how you can still enjoy the rich decadence of food without going overboard..."}
{"text":"I am addicted to Sunfare!  I travel a ton and I was looking for a break from eating out all the time. I came across Sunfare and decided to start with the 5 day Optimal Cleanse.  I'll admit, I was nervous at first because I HATE most shakes and I wasn't sure I'd make it through the 5 days, but I really wanted a great detox.  This was the EASIEST detox/cleanse I have ever experienced.  I have tried almost every cleanse out there but on this one, I was never hungry, I felt great, and I loved that you were slowly weaned off food and then slowly reintroduced.  (Yes, I did get a slight headache on the second day, but it wasn't horrible and to be expected after all the sugar I had been consuming.)  Also, I actually didn't mind the shakes, and the texture of most shakes end up making me gag.  I would add a few drops of flavored stevia, mix with water, and it was great!  I did the cleanse mostly for detox reasons, but I ended up losing 6 pounds as a bonus.  Also, I haven't had a diet soda since the cleanse and that is HUGE addiction for me to break.  The food was so great during the cleanse portion that I figured I'd give the Signature Diet a try.  I consider myself a total foodie and even I'm impressed by this food!!!!  It's fresh, flavorful, and I know that they are staying within my calorie limits.  Have there been meals I'm not crazy about?  Of course, but all I have to do is rate the meal in my online menu and I never see it again!  Is it expensive?  Yes, and I wince every time I'm reminded of what I'm spending, but if I added up the money I spent eating out and the groceries that would go to waste every month, it pretty much added up to the same.  Plus, I know I'm getting fresh ingredients, healthy meals, and I LOVE the food.  My counselor, Maegan, has been great and gets back to me immediately with any questions.    Although I do have weight to lose, I don't consider Sunfare to be 'diet food' in any way, shape, or form!  I see it as great food that happens to have the added benefit of contributing to healthy living.  I have never felt deprived and I really notice the different in how I feel when I travel and I'm forced to eat out again.  I actually look forward to getting home and starting Sunfare again each time I travel.  Give it a try, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love Sunfare!! I am on day 3 of the 5 day optimal cleanse and already down 5lbs. The program is so easy to follow and the food tastes great! I would definitely recommend to anyone considering a cleanse or meal delivery program."}
{"text":"Today is my last day of the 10 day Optimal Cleanse.  I thoroughly enjoyed the food and the shakes were good.  I added cinnamon and/or stevia, ice and blended the shakes in a VitaMix. While away from home I used the shaker bottle that came with my first day's cooler.  The third day of \"shakes only\" was a tough day for me but Joanna my counselor was fantastic and gave me some good tips.  Joanna was always right on top of my emails throughout the 10 days and I enjoyed working with her.    All of the meals were delicious and I enjoyed every single one of them.  I do like to cook on occasion and wish Sunfare would publish a recipe book!  The convenience of having the meals prepared and waiting in my refrigerator for me stopped me from picking at food when hungry.  I will try one of the other meal plans in the near future.    As far as the Optimal Cleanse goes, I will probably do the 5 day one next time instead of the 10 day.  Two days of \"shakes only\" would be good for me.  I don't think I could do the 3 days again.  I also was not able to dine out with friends for the 10 days.  Although the Sunfare food was tastier and healthier than some restaurants I've been to it made it difficult to go out.  I would highly recommend Sunfare to anyone interested in eating healthy, delicious meals!  The customer support was also a great part of the Sunfare program!!"}
{"text":"I do not cook - as you can see from the amount of reviews I write on Yelp.  But know i need to lose 20 lbs, and I saw a segment about Sunfare on ABC15 news one night and looked them up and then I tried them and the rest is history. I do the weekly plan, as i like the flexibility of being able to cancel a dinner, if I have evening plans, rather than having to cancel the whole days meals like you would have to do on the monthly plan, and I am only doing Monday-Friday, but am thinking of doing all 7 days as the food is so awesome, I really don't want to go out anywhere.    So I get 3 meals and 3 snacks - don't be fooled by the snacks, they are not power bars, I have mini pizza bites this afternoon to look forward too, I have had mixed nuts, cherries and a turkey patty - you never know what might be in there (but you will never get something you don't like, as you fill out a dislike list online before you start the service), but I had not had a power bar yet.  The meals really are gourmet - I was not expecting that - I was thinking more TV dinners - but this is high quality stuff; hence the not wanting to go out anymore.  Everything has been excellent, very fresh, the fruit awesome, great variety.  I really have not eaten so much food in a day before - the difference is this is the right food in a balanced way - you will never be hungry or experience cravings and the benefit, you lose weight !  Now, I will warn you, if like me, you ate a lot of carbs before (and I mean bad carbs, not the good carbs that Sunfare are going to give you), you are going to go through a little bit of carb withdrawal for a couple of days, as your body will be going \"what the hell, where did all my carbs go, whats with all this healthy stuff that I need to process in an efficient way?\", but I promise you that will pass and when it does you will feel great and full of energy, don't give up doing the couple of crappy days that you body tries to persuade you that it prefers junk !  It is a little pricey, but with no shopping, no gas, no eating out, no tipping, no waste (when you overbuy at the grocery store) , it is a good investment."}
{"text":"This place has changed my life! We order several times a week, and it's heavenly. I've already referred several family and friends, who are equally thrilled with the service. Great value, delicious food, tons of variety, and appealing presentation. Totally exceeded my expectations!"}
{"text":"SInce I don't have time to cook, and I live in a culinarily challenged district - I signed up to Sunfare Family Dinners. My hopes weren't too high, as I have sampled many different food delivery services, and have always been left disappointed. But, from the beginning Sunfare was different.    The Family Dinners are essentially one entree and four sides. I was shocked when I saw the portions, and how monstrous they were. It is delivered daily, so when Wednesday rolls around i am not eating food that was prepared on Sunday.  Major Plus.  The food is organic, prepared in a healthy manner, and more importantly SUPER tasty.  You can customize to the Nth degree with these meals, their client web site is easy to use, and allows for simple maintenance of your menu.  You have over 50 entrees to choose from on any given day (with surprise gourmet specials thrown in weekly), and you can mix and match the side dishes until your heart is content.  There are hundreds of side dishes; organized in categories like : Vegetables, Fruit, Carbs, Salads,  Appetizers, & Desserts. Each category is customizable daily!   We are a family of 3, and we choose the 2 serving portions and it is still enough for lunch and dinner for all of us.  The leftovers are insane, and I am always giving food away to my friends.  Being a procrastinator - when something important isn't getting done, you can bet I am sitting in the corner of my house monkeying with my Sunfare menu.  The best part is the incredible, almost insane value. For a whole entire week's worth of food - delivered daily, the price tag is $200 a week.  If you shop for your family, you will know that you cannot possibly get organic delicious ingredients for a hearty lunch and dinner for a whole week at that price.    I have nightmares about them raising their prices...  Highly, highly recommend."}
{"text":"I love this program!  The food is amazing and delicious.  I am wrapping up my first week and I have lost over 5 pounds!  It's expensive, but not when you compare it to regaining your health.  I want to lose 50 pounds and I know this will work for me."}
{"text":"Ok, I thought this would be a poor-to-middling service but I HATE to cook so I thought I'd try it for a week. I am a picky eater and too busy to do more than stuff a few snacks in my face in lieu of lunch. But I thought the convenience would outweigh any quality issues. Now, I just want to say to you: **SIGN UP TODAY**! I selected only lunch and dinner and I cannot WAIT for my meals! They are fresh, tasty, varied and just simply great. I LOVE that my food shows up every day like magic and I LOVE that the food is so good. I cannot think of any negatives, except that it took a couple phone calls for them to figure out where to pick up/drop off the freezer bags. I call, I speak to a person. I go online, I update my menus. This business concept is brilliant, user-friendly and works perfectly. And the food is great... I never expected that, I had hoped for edible. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Just got done last week with the Sunfare Optimal cleanse.  The program was easy to follow and not as difficult as I expected.   The food and shakes were enjoyable!   I mixed the shakes in the blender with ice and water and a little stevia and cinnamon and they were satisfying.   I lost exactly 10 lbs in the 10 days as claimed and I did not start out needing to lose any more than that.  Great program for those looking to drop the last 10 stubborn lbs or for those looking to get a quick jump start on a longer weight loss plan.  Thanks Sunfare for offering this great program.  I am now committed to remaining caffeine and gluten free thanks to your program!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and customer service!  They have a great selection of healthy or indulgent meals which arrive on time every time.  The packaging is great and makes it easy to store in your fridge."}
{"text":"OK, so I am not going to lie, when I first signed up for the program I thought it wasn't going to be anything more than a glorified TV dinner delivered to my door every day but boy was I wrong! They were actual, freshly made meals that tasted great! I signed up for the select diet, 3 meals and 2 snacks were delivered to my front door every night for the following day. I loved the fact that you could log into the website and choose your menu, they had so many different options.          In the past two weeks I have tried quite a few meals and snacks. My favorite for breakfast was the whole wheat blueberry pancakes, they were nice and fluffy and the blueberries added just enough sweetness. For lunch I would have to go with the open faced french dip sandwich, the roast beef was super moist and it had just enough cheese and bread. The grilled tri-tip served with a side salad was my favorite dinner, the tri-tip was cooked perfectly and had a really mild horse radish sauce that went with it great. As for the snacks my favorite mid day snack was the sliced honey turkey with fresh fruit and the fudge brownie was amazing for dessert.             Overall I would have to say that I was very impressed with the not only the quality and freshness of the meals but also the great organization the company had, they made it very easy to choose my meals and I never heard the delivery man at night which was nice especially since we have a dog. I would definitely recommend Sunfare to anyone who wants to have good quality meals delivered to them without having to put much effort into it. They are able to work with your meal plans and your budget, the staff is very friendly you can call or email them with any questions you have. I hope everyone ENJOYS!"}
{"text":"I've had the pleasure of having Sunfare deliver food to my home for over a year now and they deserve a write up.  When I first started Sunfare I thought I'd give it a try for a month because of the cost.  I wanted to know there was value to what I was paying for.  Before Sunfare I ate out a lot and ordered a lot of fast food.  I did it out of convenience so I thought Sunfare would be a good idea because it was even more convenient.  I soon realize that Sunfare was more than just convenient.  It was also healthy and delicious.  More so than most places I've eaten before.  My wife and I don't cook and when we went grocery shopping we'd end up wasting most of the grocery items because we never got around to cooking it and end up wasting a ton of money by throwing food in the garbage.  With Sunfare we never have to worry about throwing away wasted food.  So is Sunfare a good value?  Yes, it is!  No more wasted food and no more going shopping for food and no more spending time in the kitchen making inedible meals.  Sunfare is a great value if you take all these things I mentioned in consideration.  Oh and besides that my wife and I have lost weight eating these low fat meals they put together.  I highly recommend them."}
{"text":"Very impressed! I'm only on week 2 of using this service, but the food is plentiful :). I feel more energized and love that I have ZERO worry about what I'm eating day-to-day! Would recommend for anyone who's looking for delicious healthy meals without the hassle."}
{"text":"I love the program, I just wish I could afford it more often... It's a little pricy for myself. I wish they had better deals on their longer programs... But on the positive side....They have soooo many options and everything is fresh and taste great. Everything comes packed well and stays fresh even in the heat.  Sunfare, offer more specials please!! :)"}
{"text":"OK. I've gotten really fat lately (I'm trying to lose 20 pounds in a healthy way) and i remembered when my mom had them drop off her meals everyday. what sunfare does is they make fresh meals for you on whatever plan you selected, and they will drop it off for you at your address. the food follows the zone plan (at least if you are on their dieting plan) and I'm using the vegetarian option. I've failed at dieting and doing the whole \"i need to eat right\" thing. I've struggled with my weight my whole life since i was 9 years old and weight 117 pounds at five foot 9. anyway, the food under the vegetarian plan is EXCELLENT and FILLING. I've been on this for 4 full days and lost a pound so far (they say on average you should lose 2 pounds a week so hey, i have 3 more days for that 2nd pounder). you can select what you want to eat through the online site and make your own menu. what i have been loving so far are the blueberry pancakes with a scrambled egg, their taco (you actually don't have a shell but two large pieces of lettuce-imagine nachos but without the chips and its still good), omelette's, kabob, and wellington pockets. I've been following their plan to a T. i only had a craving once but its my fault since i decided to eat all my food before 6. money saving tip. don't buy the snacks from them. you can see what they give you online through the menu and its crap you can just buy in the stores like nuts (have a TINY amount), string cheese, at protein bars (kinda crazy cuz they are high in fat, carbs, and calories but its a part of their plan).  okay now, i am too embarrassed to list the prices of getting the food delivered each day. I'm also too ashamed because i don't like cooking and know the right way and right foods to eat but i have no self control. I've saved up money all my life since i was 16 for travel but hey, who wants to go to Australia and new zealand when you are fat and refuse to have your picture taken? i feel this is money well spent and thank goodness, my mom is paying half of it knowing i have body and eating issues. I'm probably going to be on this plan for 3 months. they said on average people will lose 25 pounds if following their program precisely. I've been writing things down to see how they made their food assuming once I'm done, i will try to keep this weight off. i will also post pictures on here to show you what i have been eating. oh yeah. aside from them being expensive, there aren't exactly sweets on this diet aside from fruit and the pancakes i guess. having the protein bar a day helps with that though. you do have carbs on this diet but the \"healthy carbs\" so there isn't much bread, pasta, rice, or cereal. i will do an update often on here to tell you guys of how much weight i have been losing. i think I'm your prime example of someone that needs to lose 10 pounds (at least according to my bmi). i made my goal 20 because underneath all my fat is actually a fairly petite hour glass figure that I've had once in awhile :("}
{"text":"I just did the 5 day cleanse last week, and it was life changing!!  The first 2 days were rough, especially after being completely negligent of my diet for months (was having lots of carbs and dairy, etc.), but on day 3 I felt fantastic and my cravings were gone. The food was delicious, the shakes tasted yummy and the lovely gifts are much appreciated! After the cleanse I have been finding that I am not as hungry as I was before it and I still don't crave the carbs, sugary sodas or snacks I was having before!  This was the perfect jump start for me getting back in the gym and on a healthy eating lifestyle - thank you so much Sunfare!"}
{"text":"I travel a lot and have been to some of the best restaurant in the country.  The food you get on this service is as good as any restaurant I've been too. Add to that the food is portion right and includes a variety of all the food groups. In my mind is a no brainer.   I've been wanting to eat healthy and change my diet for health reasons. I've tried to do it myself but I just don't have the time to cook or shop and all the other things that go with that.    Is it cheap? If you consider all of the things that you are getting for the price.  Yes. It actually is not bad deal.  When not on this plan. Two of my meals at home were at fast food place or a restaurant. When you consider the price for that plus the fact that it's not as healthy and I have to go get it.  This is great.   I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Literally can't live without my sunfare.  Not only is the food amazing, I have more time in my day.  No groceries, cooking or clean-up... Awesome!!!  A must try"}
{"text":"Delicious Food and my husband luvs  All his favorite meals  delivered nightly! They are always helpful....you can depend on Sunfare"}
{"text":"Absolutely love Sunfare! Healthy and delicious meals for those with busy schedules trying to eat clean. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We signed up for the \"family meal\" option (not a special diet or weight loss thing, just regular meal delivery) for two people during several weeks when our kitchen was being remodeled.  I was expecting a step up from frozen microwavable dinners, honestly - boy, was I surprised.  The food was fantastic, better than you'd get in many restaurants, and somehow prepared in a way that it was always delicious even heated in a microwave (which was all we had).  Meat was never dry, veggies and fruits were very good quality, and I loved most of the default meal combos.  On the few occasions when I don't like the menu plan, there are tons of other options to choose from, and I can make the switch easily online.  If we have other plans for some nights, we can just cancel those meals and not pay for them (you have to cancel online with 48 hrs notice).    We ordered nightly dinners for two people, and at $40/day it's expensive, but the portions were generous.  Meals were almost always enough for both of us to have lunch AND dinner, sometimes even more than that.  It ended up being cheaper than ordering pizza or getting takeout all the time, and the food is much better.  Plus they drop it off right outside your door overnight, very carefully packaged.    My only small complaint is that I tend to like spicy food, and they don't have a lot of that.  Not to say it's bland - it's flavorful - but not a lot of heat.    The \"family meal\" plan would be a fantastic idea for anyone who 1) is remodeling a kitchen, like us,  2) works really long hours and wants beautiful food waiting for them at home with zero effort or 3) is in some stressful situation where cooking is difficult - taking care of a sick family member, for instance.  I think we're going to keep using this service for a night or two per week even when the kitchen's done. It's that good."}
{"text":"I've been working out with a trainer for 3 months now and attempting to lose weight, working 50+ hours a week, with a boyfriend that's attempting to gain weight, makes it difficult to get meals ready for my lunches. I started looking for a food delivery service and ran across Sunfare online and immediately wanted to give it a try. The ability to adjust the macronutrients, and control what you could get everyday, made the decision to try it, incredibly easy.  There are certain \"normal\" foods that I don't like and Sunfare allows you to check boxes to opt out of certain ingredients. Then when you're looking at meals, if there's a meal in the list that contains one of those ingredients, it'll mark it red and warn you that it contains an ingredient you don't like.  I got my first delivery today that contained lunch and an afternoon snack. I'm not lying when I say they were both amazing. Not just delicious, but amazing. It's an expensive price tag but for the quality of delicious food I just got today, I'm keeping it for as long as my budget will allow. I mean Netflix or not, I'll figure out a way to keep Sunfare."}
{"text":"Doing the 10 day optimal cleanse. The experience has been fantastic. They are making my goals totally achievable!"}
{"text":"I decided to try Sunfare for 5 days and this company is awesome! The food is delicious and it is really convenient to use. All the food is fresh, not frozen and its delivered directly to your door! I highly recommend this service to anyone who is looking for a food delivery plan."}
{"text":"The best food delivery service I have found.  I've tried about 4 different other services.  Sunfare delivers daily fresh (not frozen) food to your door (they deliver in the middle of the night so it's there when you wake up).    I originally started with the 10 day cleanse, the 3 days of only the shakes was hard and I cheated a bit I understand why the 5 day cleanse would be enough.  The cleanse was perfect for me to kick all my old cravings and get back on track.  After the cleanse I'm not eating the Paleo food.  Everything is very healthy, clean food, simple not a lot of sauces just good flavor.  My husband is on the Natural Gourmet...yummy yummy and heaven in every meal.   He will be switching because of price but if you can afford it it is soooo worth it.   All organic, none hormonal, etc gourmet foodie experience.  The creativity and plating in every meal is superior to 5 star restaurants.   Every meal is so different every day, which is he's to find in a food delivery service.    Customer service is amazing, very responsive and helpful.   I can't say enough good things.  If I were to meal plan, buy groceries, spend time cooking, and then eat out still a bit...my time and money would cost more to me then Sunfare as a busy working professional.  I have my Sunday's back instead of meal prepping!"}
{"text":"I was assisted all the way in setting up an account as a gift, which involved several emails back and forth with immediate and helpful responses and suggestions. When I needed to cancel due to the recipient requiring something else, the response was again immediate, professional, helpful and courteous.  Terrific people to work with! Thank you, Sunfare!"}
