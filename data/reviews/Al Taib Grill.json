{"text":"Food OK. Prices OK.

Just watch out if you pay by credit card or interac. Paid with Visa credit card and got charged more than the actual amount on the printed invoice. Talked to the owner a few days after noticing incorrect charge and he refused to admit error was made while Visa transaction was clearly greater than the invoice amount... possible scam!? - Pay cash and make sure to double-check any change given back!"}
{"text":"Excellent service à la clientèle et la nourriture était fraiche. Par contre, la poulet shish taouk manquait de goût. Heureusement, les salades qui étaient bien juteuses permettaient de compenser ce manque quand je les combinais au poulet."}
{"text":"My husband and I were in Montreal recently and I pretty much shopped until I dropped so I was completely exhausted and my feet hurt so much at the end of the day.  It was snowing and really cold out so my husband offered to go get me some meat pies at Arouch because he knows I love meat pies.  Anyway, Arouch was closed, and Al Taib was close to Arouch and was open, so he bought a chicken shawarma for him, and a beef shawarma and a piece of baklava for me (because he knows I have a sweet tooth).

The beef shawarma was good, but nothing about it really makes it stand out from other places.  I had a bite of my husband's chicken shawarma and it was amazing.  It was so tender and juicy and had a really strong smokey and grilled flavour to it.  My husband said that they cut the chicken off the spit and then they threw it on the grill and grilled it before putting it in the shawarma.  Why didn't they do this to the beef?  Who knows.  The chicken was much yummier than the beef.  All ingredients in the shawarma tasted fresh.

I did not like the baklava.  There were green pistachio crumbs sprinkled on top, but the nuts used in the baklava tasted like peanuts to me.  Yuck.  I like my baklava filled with pistachios or almonds, not cheap filler nuts like peanuts. 

Overall, chicken shawarma delicious, beef shawarma ok, baklava yuck."}
{"text":"I'd never really thought about going here because it always looked soso and it was always empty. My friends convinced me to try it out and I was pleasantly surprised. They have ample seating, good prices, friendly staff, and decent food at ok prices and big portions.

We came here after our class so it was empty and we got to just sit and talk and eat. One of the employees even made us some tea because it was so cold out. 

I ordered the beef pita trio. The potatoes are a bit too soft but the garlic sauce is very good. I felt the pita could've been warmer but it wasn't bad.

This place is halal. They accept debit and credit."}
{"text":"Very hearty food, large portions and service with a smile - combined with $10 combos, it is a definite winner."}
