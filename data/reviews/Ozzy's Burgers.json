{"text":"My fianc√© and I had a great experience here; food was absolutely delicious and not to mention the hospitality Ozzy and his team provided us was superb. Would definitely go back again on my next visit or better yet, Ozzy should consider opening up another location in New York so that we don't have to wait so long to eat there again."}
{"text":"Top notch quality burgers !! Very warm and friendly staff. Great service ! Being an Indian I like my food little salty and spicy....so could have been better if beef was a little salty/ more juicy ! Need to have some kinda hot sauce."}
{"text":"Read other reviews and had to go check it out. This was my first visit and I know I will be coming back for more. The prices are amazing ($6.00 for a classic cheeseburger and $5.00 for a cheeseburger both of which are very well sized made with ground beef), the service is 5 stars for what it is. The restaurant itself is very small but has a good amount of tables. The milkshakes are great as well fries 10/10. For a university student who is looking for cheap eats around downtown you can't look further than Ozzy's.  Thank you for the personalized experience guys, I will be coming back for seconds!"}
{"text":"I had the classic cheeseburger and it was amazing, probably one of the best cheeseburgers I've ever had. I could tell the meat was fresh and it had a lot of flavor. The bun is so soft and buttery. The fries were great too and I loved the dipping sauce, not sure what it is, but maybe Ozzy's sauce. My only complaints are they forgot the pickles (one of the key items for me) and they advertise a $7.99 combo on a board outside. It doesn't say Monday-Friday, just 11am to 6pm, but apparently that doesn't apply at 3pm on a Saturday. Anyway I'll definitely be back for more burgers."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 6 stars. By-far the best burger I've ever had in my entire life. Super tasty, beats all the burger restaurants within the vicinity. Everything here is fresh, the beef is fresh and super tasty, vegetables, sauces the works.  Service 5 stars  Price 5 stars  Quality 6 stars"}
{"text":"Finally got around to come to @ozzysburgers since I've moved back to St. Catharines!  What do I have to say about it? Def go eat! .  Burgers are amazing - handmade, special spiced patties available unlike the generic patty - and made with love  - the owner @ozgrskr is such an amazing and open person! It's like going to your family restaurant!    Burger: Son of a Bun (extra sauwccyyy)   Onion Rings - good! Crisp af  Poutine  - can be better and the owner said he is working on it!  Will def be back to try it again and some other stuff!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing place! It is usually overcrowded, but believe me, standing in the queue for about 30 min is definitely worth it. Burger patties were moist, and fries - very good. All burger menu is, actually, very interesting and uncommon. There are few tables inside, but it is a really great place for a fast burger meal. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I have had not only in Toronto but ever. The eggy soft bun is what really makes it, so the entire burger just sinks when you bite in. The juicy patty and sauce taste great. The cheese is nicely melted on the patty. I added caramelized onions (free) and mushrooms ($1) and it was a beautiful combination. Got a combo (drink + fries) for $3.99 extra.  My friends got the Purple Rain and Son of a Bun and loved them as well.  They are huge burgers but you don't feel too heavy afterwards.   They offer wifi and accept card.   Downsides: 1) The table close to the stairwell overlies a heater vent, so if you sit there in the wintertime, you'll feel like you're sitting in a fiery pit.  2) Fries were mediocre. Nice thick cut and crispy and a good portion, but somehow quite bland even when salted.  3) All names were misspelled as if we were at Starbucks (\"Graze\" for Grace, \"Paola\" for Paula)"}
{"text":"\"Tired\" that's what he said when asked how it's going on a snowy, slushy, cold and miserable Saturday evening. After seeing rave reviews for Ozzy's, sitting proudly in the once disgraced location for Grilled Cheese near the top of Kensington, I knew I had to try one of their fresh made burgers. Being taken in over the last few years with the burger wars in the city, gradually the frenetic pace of new spots has declined with contenders P&L and Gangster Burger now sadly gone, replaced by the latest dessert and sweets spots. Ozzy to the rescue! I had the basic burger c/w onion rings. Nothing fancy here folks, this is a typical looking hand formed burger on a fluffy white bun.  There's something about sitting in this super cozy and casual room with everyone there not even looking up from their delicious meals of fried goodness that makes the experience even more appetizing.  It has the front wall as a glass garage door making the space airy despite the small size and almost zero room between the little tables.  The serving platter dropped down in front of me unceremoniously, and I rose to grab a serviette which was a few feet away. The people seem so nice working here! Super friendly and genuinely appreciative of their customers. Now I have a new favourite spot for burgers, hallelujah !"}
{"text":"I had ozzys regular cheese burger and he individualized it after I told him I like spicy food. The burger was phenomenal but more so the owner is an amazing person. He was friendly, making sure all of his customers are satisfied and he made a personalized burger for my friend. When I asked him if I could buy a can of pop, he didnt even charge me. To a man who is generous and kind, and makes killer burgers, this place is a highly recommend."}
{"text":"I tried almost whats in the menu...very delicious!!!! Dont miss it when u r in Toronto most famous dish son of a bun"}
{"text":"Delicious. The place is very well ran and you can tell everyone working there is having a good time, including the owner who is always there to make sure that you're happy with your experience. The food is fantastic. The quality of the fries and of the burger is way above average. You can tell with just one bite that everything is fresh. The best part however is that this place is quite cheap for the quality of the food and the service. I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"We love Ozzy's Burgers, and I'll tell you why.  -The staffs are incredibly friendly -The place is clean -The food is 100% fresh made daily.  -Ozzy Sauce is super tasty.   If you come by Kensington definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"OMG! thanks Yelp! You just found In N Out Burger in Toronto. Wow that was really really really good! I haven't even left the restaurant yet lol I couldn't wait to give Yelp, the thanks they deserve. My first burger was a classic cheeseburger. That's my go-to when visiting a burger shop. If they mess that up they wont get anything else right. Like I said. This is In N Out Burger and it was So incredibly good! I can't wait to come back and try one of their other sandwiches or burgers."}
{"text":"The staff is so friendly here, and you can taste that in the food. It's all fresh-made, and delicious. Portions are large for the fries, and get some of the homemade sauces for dipping."}
{"text":"Was so excited to try Ozzy's Burger. Showed up so excited to a full restaurant with only 5 tables. We had to take it to go because there was no where to sit. The poutine was made with a gravy - the only way to describe it is like eating cinnamon and cheese together. The burgers were just okay. Would not visit again"}
{"text":"The burgers looked so good I forgot to take picture before diving in! Amazing beef patty quality. I had the sun of a bun and the portable mushroom sooooo good. Place has a very cozy vibe, Ozzy the owner was super nice, very chatty and is hands on in the kitchen. Def coming back again."}
{"text":"Delicious burger, excellent service and halal meat.       good job                          Thank you"}
{"text":"This burger joint is amazing!! Freshly made burgers! All the ingredients were fresh! They freshly grind their meat multiple times during the day! Very hospitable and extremely friendly staff!! Tried the place for the first time and had the OZZY STEAKBURGER and the PURPLE RAIN. Both were amazing!! Never knew pineapple on a burger would taste sooo good!  I was hesitant as first because some reviews said the customer service wasn't great. I'm sure they must have made improvements because a few of the staff including someone I assume was the owner made a point of welcoming us as well as the other customers that walked in after us.  The seating area is somewhat limited but the ambiance is great with a rustic vibe. They've only been open for 3 months and they've made it to the big leagues. Featured on different food shows too! Definitely worth the 8 hour trip up here and will visit them again every time I'm in Canada."}
{"text":"Ozzy's makes a stellar burger. Other people's photos probably do the burger better justice than I can, but I'll say that they're freshly-ground beef with a loose pack seared on a flat-top. They were served fast and cooked perfectly on our visit. Kinda messy - the brioche bun could've used a little toasting. But this didn't diminish the experience. And the poutine was fantastic as well - potatoes were crisp and other poutine-related slop was plentiful.  I'm not sure the restaurant itself is fully accessible - there's a high step at the entrance, which itself is separated from the sidewalk by a crushed-stone patio."}
{"text":"This one recenlty open last summer but its been on the list for a few months after  hitting Top Gun and Burgernator in Kensington already I felt I should give Ozzy Burger a shot and it wasnt a choice I regretted.  The small location does bring in crowd I was lucky to even find a seat but with their patio coming soon even more people can cramp into this small shop for a great tasting burger.  The burger had what I liked, fresh grounded meat, juicy to taste and all the topping and fixing made this burger all too good.    I had a side of poutine with it, at first I had cold gravy but was easily fixed with more gravy. Thou there was something different with way the gravy was made, it was a bit lighter then expect but still good. Fries were crispy and cheese was okay. Not my favourite part but it was okay  I came here for a good burger and that what I got. There is more competition in Kensington for a good burger but I love to have choices. I will be back."}
{"text":"It was alright - I got the son of a bun and the bun was soggy with all the juices of the meat. Maybe my expectations are a bit high, but I wouldn't rate it super duper good. Twas tasty in conclusion. Hopefully they fix the soggy buns because it's kinda important   Service was quick and great and I couldn't ask for more."}
{"text":"Awesome!  I usually don't bother with reviews, but this place is all heart and matched with top quality.  I had the \"Son of a Bun\" which is a well balanced mix of beef and chicken strips with saut√©ed jalape√±o, caramelized onions, sauces, delicious.  A bit messy, just don't put it down once you start.  Speaking with the owners, these guys are using the highest and most expensive quality ingredients, nothing frozen, everything is made and used up daily.  By far my top burger joint now."}
{"text":"After more than 10 hours on the road, I arrive in Toronto starving and my friend says \"just grab a burger at Ozzy's\"  Knowing nothing about the city, I plug it into my google maps and head over.  Fortunately it was an hour before closing on a Thursday night so I was able to find parking in Kensington Market.    Ozzy's is straight up no thrills dining, because who needs thrills when your food brings all the excitement.  I ordered a cheesburger with the beef bacon.  The patty's are hand-formed, but they seem to press them just enough to keep them from being overly greasy.  The flavor on the burger was heaven in my mouth.  They didn't overcook it nor did they undercook it.  Pure juicy, quality halal beef flavor.  The fries were also well done.  They were perfectly crispy without being dry and hard.  They had a touch of salt for flavor but not so much you were overwhelmed.  I'd never had beef bacon before.  Not my jam, but I don't fault them for that.  I can read and figured I'd give it a go.  If you want a burger, this is your joint.    The place is small.  Fortunately we arrived late so we were able to find seating but it's tight quarters, so be prepared to take your food elsewhere to enjoy it."}
{"text":"The burgers were delicious but a little over-the-top. The restaurant was very very tiny and there was no place to sit. The most ridiculous part was seeing families bringing their multiple kids and attempting to sit down with the whole family. This place is extremely tiny and it makes no sense for anyone to plan to come hang out here. We were lucky for just the two of us--my husband and I--to get seated and then had to wait about 30 minutes to get our food. My burger was delicious I got the burger with the chicken wings in there. My husband got the burger double patty with the bacon his was good but a bit too meaty in my opinion!   Definitely a delicious burger but the place felt really claustrophobic so I would want them to expand before I return again.  Again I am all for places being family friendly, but I honestly don't understand when families bring two kids to come have burgers in a place that you barely have space to stand! I saw multiple families and it made me wonder why go through the hassle?? it was either burning hot or freezing cold in there! I would never put my child through such conditions. I also saw multiple people order, receive their food and stand right by the door and eat it! I understand it was cold outside but it makes no sense! this is one of those places either you take your food to go and literally leave the restaurant or you find a place to sit! there's literally no space to stand period! Even made us wait about 5 to 10 minutes before they took our order because they had so many orders in Queue already!"}
{"text":"Tried Ozzy's last night. Needless to say that I loved it. Mess created while eating Mustang Sally was worth it. However, the patties can be a bit more juicer.  P.S- please don't try to eat this (or any burger) with fork and knife."}
{"text":"Ozzy's is a quaint little burger joint in the heart of Kensington Market. My experience at Ozzy's was incredible and I'm certain that I'll be back.   I had the Paradise City burger, which might be one of the best burgers I've had in this city. I'm a huge fan of the brioche bun, the \"Shake Shack\"-esque smashed burger style, and the top quality beef. Topped with healthy amounts of cheese and just the right amount of jalape√±os, and it's game over.  Ozzys, the owner of this establishment, was incredibly attentive to my friends and I even though the place was jam packed. He let us know that he's preparing additional seating in the patio space for the summer to alleviate the seating and crowding issue. I'll be sure to bring friends from out of town to Ozzy's as part of the mandatory Kensington Market tour.  Give Ozzy's a try. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"A great addition to Kensington market and my new favourite halal burger joint!  It's a small cozy place ran by a bunch of friends from what I could tell, and these people created a great casual atmosphere. There are jokes flying around from the kitchen, people laughing while cooking, one of the guys would do a round and check on everybody if they are enjoying their meal or if they needed anything.  Good things about Ozzy's: 1) burgers are reasonably priced, they haven't inflated their prices due to the wage hike like other halal burger joints, at least $2-$3 cheaper for the same potion size.  2) Beef patty itself is tasty without the toppings, I don't know it's the fact that everything is fresh that makes it tasty or they season it well.  3) they use a bigger bun so it covers the beef patties and toppings well, makes the burger easier to eat and less greasy. We got the Son of a Bun and Mustang Sally and both of them were pretty good. The \"Beef Chilli Fries\" however was missing beef, i was under the impression that it would have it."}
{"text":"I ordered the notorious BLT burger with a side of small fries. The burger was very juicy and delicious (especially because of the egg yolk) but also very messy! If you go to this place make sure you're going on an empty stomach because the burgers are very filling. I actually had to take my fries to-go because I was too full from the burger  I think next time I'd get the burger without the bacon. Honestly, the bacon tasted good but it was really hard/chewy and when I took a bite of the bacon I couldn't break it apart and it ended up ripping my burger apart. Also next time I'd probably ask for extra tomato just because it was a little overwhelming to be eating a beef patty, bacon and egg all in one bite.   This place gets busy very quickly so if you go during a weekend at lunch time, don't expect a table because it was completely full when I went today.   Overall the burger and fries I had were very delicious and satisfying - perfect to satisfy your cravings"}
{"text":"Burger was decent definitely not number one I got the mustang sally and it didn't even come with the onion rings on the burger like it said it would so ? hopefully next time I'll have a better experience"}
{"text":"Nice easy ordering and the burger I had was great. Had the sweet potato fries and they were very good too.  Nice outside patio"}
{"text":"BURGER PERFECTION. Just last week I was reviewing my trainwreck of a visit to Rudy, and how that place was a mess and Burger's Priest still rules forever. Well, move over Priest, because HOLY COW, Ozzy's is amazing. I wasn't even really hungry, so I just got a plain cheeseburger, with minimal expectations. Seriously ONE OF THE BEST BURGERS I HAVE EVER EATEN. Amazing. Perfect. Juicy. Savory. INCREDIBLE. The hand formed patty is similar to a Burger's Priest patty, but where Priest is more smashed and compacted, Ozzy's is somehow both thicker and has an airy, more voluminous texture. The thickness and air pockets in the texture of the ground beef make for a burger that is soooo juicy and flavourful, cooked to absolute perfection - it's just so damn good. The bun is perfectly toasted and buttered, it's just the perfect bun on the perfect burger. From first bite, I was just shocked at the perfection. Love love love love love!!!  My partner excels at ordering the wrong thing wherever he goes, and said his veggie burger was just ok. He had a bite of my burger, agreed it was one of the best EVER, and went back to ruminating on how he always orders the wrong thing. Fries were good, loved the honey mustard mayo they are served with. Onion rings were also great.   Service was so-so. Fries and onion rings were served ridiculously straight from the oil hot, which could be a good thing, but they were placed scalding hot right in front of children, which is a very bad and dangerous thing. They definitely need to rest these fried items before serving, should be a no brainer. There were no less than SEVEN staff just forming burgers in the back, which was impressive, but there was also a manager talking loudly on his phone who never greeted us or smiled or anything. This is a bad thing. Get it together on the service - it will never be as good as your burgers, but if you make a burger that good, you can definitely try to smile more. Will be back on the regular for burger perfection!!!"}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I do a once a week cheat day. This week we visited Ozzy's! We shared a large order of onion rings. We waited about 5 minutes. The onion rings were excellent. They were hot from the fryer and extremely crispy. Would highly recommend.   The last thing I should mention is that the girl who took our order looked extremely annoyed and bored. However, the food was good and the service was quick, so the girl's attitude didn't significantly hamper our viist."}
{"text":"Great burgers worth the buck liron priborkin"}
{"text":"I was there last night. I asked the service guy where do u get ur cheese from? Does it contain animal ingredients like renner or lipases etc. He had no idea. When i pressed him he said everything is #Halal. I went to the counter to speak with owner. He was busy working without any food gloves, he was touching food, utensils, his hairs, etc everything and usinf same hands to handle food like buns, tomato, lettus you name it.   So i waited, and then asked him, he said yes yes halal, then i asked do u know which brand ur using? He responded very rudely everything is halal.   By the tone he used , the way he was speaking, i dont think this place is serving anything halal or know what it means to be halal food place.   Also he was so rude to his staff working in the back.   Eat at this place at ur own risk. A) he uses his bare hands to handle food and everything else around him. B ) halal status of his food is highly doubtful. If he can prove me wrong i be happy to update my review."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out after seeing it on BlogTO, I ended up getting the mustang sally which initially was very delicious and extremely juicy but after a couple bites it was hard to really distinguish any flavour. Since it is a double patty all I ended up tasting was meat (not that, thats a bad thing) but I guess I was simply looking for something that would tickle my taste buds more...   Nonetheless, I did eat it all and enjoyed it. The only downside is that the place is very very small and it was really difficult for my friends and I to find a seat because the whole restaurant was filled with people. I would suggest if you do come here to get take out. I would probably not come back tbh just because it was not the most amazing burger I have ever had, plus there are other places around the area that I think has better burgers... But, who knows, maybe one day i'll come back to try something else."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim after getting a notification for a restaurant suggestion! I don't typically eat burgers because I don't eat meat but I scanned through the options and saw vegan burgers which is what drew me in.    Located in one of my favourite areas in Toronto, Kensington Market. The space itself is tight but cozy and the kitchen staff is friendly. I had a portobello mushroom burger with veggie fries on the side and my friend had a beef burger.  The mushroom burger was delicious, coated with a crunchy crust and stuffed with cheese. The bun was perfect too, toasted, not too thick and easy to bite into. I've had many veggie burgers and portobello mushroom burgers and this burger is on my top 3 list. The veggie fries were great as well, the sauces and cheese were a good mix but they could have gone lighter on saut√©ed onions and peppers.   *My friend that had the 'purple rain' beef burger rated his burger an 8/10. He liked that the burger did not fall apart into pieces considering it's size. It was so good he ate the massive burger in one sitting.   Overall if you like burgers or want to give a veggie burger a try, this is the place to go. I'm happy we decided to give Ozzy's a chance, we will be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the service was exceptional. The place is clean and there is a sense of transparency as the kitchen is not obscured. The decor is intimate but not cramped and festive! I may return to Canada just to have the vegan burger and those heavenly onion rings! Sorry for not including a picture--I was so excited to eat my food and boy was I glad I dived in as soon as possible!"}
{"text":"Omg stop reading reviews and go here!!! It was maybe the tasting burger we have had. I'm mad we decided to split the Portabello Burger. We made it a combo for 3.99 extra. Fries were tasty. The only down side is hardly any room to sit and eat...It seems like a trend in Toronto."}
{"text":"Ozzy's Burgers was phenomenal!!!! I can't stress it enough!! I went there tonight I literally just left and I had to write a review!!! It was a group of 4, we got the son of a bun x 2, purple rain and mustang sally! We also got 3 poutines....that's where it gets complicated, the poutine was absolutely terrible it was one of the worst I have ever had I ate 1 fry literally and didn't touch it! My boyfriend said we should order fries so when I went to order the fries Ozzy the owner asked if everything was okay? I said honestly we aren't feeling the poutine at all! The cheese isn't melted the gravy was cold! But to be honest we didn't even care to complain we actually didn't even want to mention it! Because the burger was SO good. Hands down the best I have had in a really long time! That's why we didn't complain! Whatever we ended up ordering a large regular fries, a large sweet potato and he brought us a new large poutine he reassured us it was fresh! It definitely was amazing we shared the large between the four of us! We all agreed though we wouldn't get the poutine it was a first and a last! You can skip the poutine and you wouldn't miss anything special! Eats eats eats! We get to the counter to pay and Ozzy said we can't pay!!! I'm like no I'm paying!! Charge me up! He refuses to charge us!!! He wouldn't let us pay for any of our meal! We all insisted to pay! Repeatedly! The poutine won't stop us from coming back!! For sure it was just like merp whatever no biggie! This was my second time going and everybody else's first time! I convinced them to go there because I couldn't stop talking about it!!! Therefore you have to go!! Try it!! Why not? What do you have to loose?! 5$ on a poutine?! Like insane! Stop reading this and go!!! Ozzy! You are so humble, sweet, kind hearted, professional, and hilarious!!! We appreciate all your kind service, we wish you nothing but success, wealth, health and happiness!!! We will be back my friend! Ps what's in Ozzy secret sauce????!! Bottle it up and sell it to me???! Xoxo see you soon!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ozzy's Burgers is aptly named because its burgers are good. And that's it.  I ordered the lamb burger and it was a beautiful blend of tenderness that did the protein a much deserved justice that many restaurants miss.  But not everyone at out table had the same experience. One of us ordered the classic burger with poutine and though the patty was quite over done, it was still bearable. The poutine was cold, though it came right out of the kitchen and so obviously we sent it back because life is too short for bad poutine and that's when one of the owners came to our table to address the issue.   He was cocky and rude my friend, as though he was doing us a favour by letting us sit in his restaurant and taking our money to give us food. But we spoke to him calmly and told him that we were also missing a couple of orders of fries (which were heartbreakingly under seasoned when they arrived) and we expected all the food to arrive at the same time because the whole purpose of going to a restaurant with friends is so that we can enjoy a meal together; and not stare awkwardly at the ceiling while someone else is trying to resist their food out of politeness.   Anyway, he eventually calmed down and tried to overcompensate for his horrifying customer service.   Verdict: Worth a trip, but expect a wait time and bad customer service and sad fries."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my burger! I ordered the Portobello burger (one of their two vegan burgers labeled on the menu). It was quite tasty and reasonably priced. The fries weren't so great, I could've done without them.   There is a variety of interesting burgers on the menu here for meat eaters. I would say it's worth a try if you're strolling through Kensington."}
{"text":"Cool divey burger joint in Kensington. Ordered a double patty cheese burger. The taste of the burger was okay, nothing to rave home about. Proportion of the patty and bun ratio however was off. The patties only covered 80% of the buns. I don't know about you, but I like meat, bun and toppings in every single bite when I eat my burger.   Fries were disappointing. Soggy and oily. There were four of us who ordered fries. Imagine getting four orders of soggy fries.. Bleh  Service was friendly and fast, hence the 3-star."}
{"text":"Let's start with the positives. 1. The fries and garlic sauce were really good! They are double fried, have a crispy outside and soft inside. 2. All the ingredients looked and tasted very fresh. The meat, veggies, bun, and fries. Everything. 3. A younger gentleman, who was not Ozzy, was friendly and polite.  That's all the good I have to say.  My overall experience was poor. I walked in with my girlfriend and was \"greeted\" by a seated smileless Ozzy (who remained seated), who simply pointed to the stack of menus and said, \"menus are there\". When we were ready to order, I said Hi, to which Ozzy replied with silence and a solemn stare. We ordered the Mustang Sally, Breaking Baaaad Lamb Burger, and large fries ($29 total). We took a seat and waited for our food.  Shortly after, a large group came in, and turned out to be Ozzy's friends. One friend announced that he has brought a lot of people. Ozzy greeted them with smiles and handshakes.  Our fries came to our table first. Ozzy himself brought it over, with his body facing his friends and turned away from us, holding the tray with 1 hand for me to receive. I said thank you and was again answered by silence. Delicious fries!  The burgers arrived. Beef patties fell apart out of the bun. The meat was fresh but tasteless. Probably not seasoned. The lamb had a bit of taste from the rosemary, but otherwise tasteless like the beef.  I was surprised to see 5 star review for this place after experiencing it myself. If I was rating just the food, it would be 3.5 stars. Overall experience is 2 stars."}
{"text":"Ozzy's Burgers is a small quaint shop in the Kensington Market. Their burgers are quite tasty although the premium burgers are more expensive than I'd typically pay ($11.99) Next time, I would probably just get the classic cheeseburger for $6 since the premium were a little too heavy for me anyways.  We got the Ciao Bello Portobello and Mustang Sally, both of which were delicious. The poutine was good although I'd preferred have cheese curds to be more melted than it was.  Overall, this is a good casual spot for a burger craving.  Takes credit cards including AMEX!"}
{"text":"We were very impressed with Ozzy's food quality and selection. Thus was easily the best food we had while visiting Toronto. This would have been a 5 star review hands down if they had not been out of gluten free buns. My wife has an intolerance so that meant no bun for her, but this was the only complaint. My son and I both had the Mustang Sally,  and were both very impressed with the juiciness of the burger, and quality of the fries. Do yourself a favor and hurry down to Ozzy's for the best burger in Toronto."}
{"text":"Heard good place to have a burger was in the neighborhood tried the BLT burger look's good ate half way into it realize it was still not fully cooked felt like saying mooo mooo LOL"}
{"text":"I was over the moon when I heard about Ozzy's, a burger joint featuring AAA beef (no additives/preservatives, never frozen) griddle-smashed/diner-style burgers, just steps from work! The place is a bit tight, with a handful of wobbly four-seaters. I walked into a scent of all that charring beefy Maillard goodness permeating the shop.  I ordered a Ciao Bello and Purple Rain. Overall, the quality of the beef patties and the buns were good, and the combinations/features of each specialized burger very interesting. Personally, I feel Ozzy could afford to season more aggressively, as at points I felt my burgers could have done a bit better with an extra hit of salt.  It's difficult for me not to think of Burger's Priest's \"the Priest\" when evaluating the Ciao Bello. Both feature a fried crusted cheese-stuffed portobello component. In this match-up, Ozzy's wins out. The Ciao Bello is less greasy and the stuffed mushroom is more memorably satisfying to bite into. Just the sheer joy of sinking your teeth into that juicy and crispy mushroom and have that melty cheesy goodness fill your mouth and mix with the rest of the sandwich is all the reason you need to get this burger.  I've had multiple burgers in the past featuring a slice of seared pineapple (including Big Smoke and Holy Chuck's) and in my experience, it's sweet, spicy, and extra juicy. But Ozzy one-ups them here again, as you'll find in addition to the grilled pineapple and jalapeno, there's fresh guacamole. The chunky creamy goodness coming in the background to the juicy, tangy, sweetness of the pineapple makes this my favourite of the two so far.  I've yet to try any of the sides but when I do, I hope to see more crazy burger stack creations and expanded drink options (craft soda). Keep it up Ozzy."}
{"text":"Burgers were fantastic. Got the Ozzy steak burger and the Purple Rain.  Both were great, soft, and juicy. I'd have to say the purple rain was my favorite. Something about the pineapple and jalapeno just popped out at me. Probably one my favorite burgers in the Toronto area.  The hosts we're wonderful people. They were friendly and quick to strike up a conversation, not just with us but the other customers as well.  Conveniently located in Kensington market, it's definitely a place I can see myself coming to regularly."}
{"text":"I came in here a couple of months ago really excited to try there burgers especially because I like my burgers medium rare and that is a pretty (excuse my pun) rare thing here in Toronto. I ordered a burger with mushrooms I think, maybe another veggie. Definitely not cheese as I am lactose intolerant and well as self destructive as I can be at times, I know not to order my burger with belly kryptonite.   Burger came back medium rare. It seems to taste pretty good but I couldn't really tell because it was covered in cheese. Brought it back, they seemed pissed but were willing to remake my burger. I got it back a second time, this time no cheese but it was well done. Here, I felt pretty torn here because I didn't want to piss anybody off.  I really just wanted to eat my damn burger. However, the whole reason I came here was because they made burgers medium rare so with held breath I bring back my burger for a third time just hoping I can have a medium rare burger with no cheese the way I can eat it without getting sick. I was respectful and did not raise my Voice. The guy who I believe is the owner told me that he would not make it again and that I definitely ordered with cheese ( I did not). He also said something to the affect of I was disrespecting him as a food service person. Well, this would have been my regular spot. I am sure I am not the only one who has been witness to this kind of rudeness. I felt humiliated."}
{"text":"Yes, I know I recently wrote another review on a burger joint (Extra Burger), but I've been wanting to visit Ozzy's Burgers in Kensington Market for a while now. Fun fact, this place used to be a grilled cheese sandwich place but long story short, I'm glad it's a burger joint. We need more variety in Kensington Market for cheap eats. $5 for a burger - nice, simple, pretty good. The burgers are HUGE, I would not recommend getting the double patty unless you've been starving for a few days. Yes, it is messy to eat, yes it may not be the healthiest option in Kensington, but it's cheap and good. Plus, you get bad ass Ozzy serving you at the cash reg. There's maybe 10-15 seats tops, so it's small but cozy. They also have a milkshake machine. HOORAY for more cheap eats in Kensington Market."}
{"text":"My favourite Halal joint in Kensington market. Super welcoming and friendly staff. Lovely seating both inside and outside. I usually order the Son of a Gun with fries/onion rings. Both the beef and chicken are delicious and taste fresh. All the burgers look mouth watering! I saw Ozzy's on Instagram, and I must say that their posts are the reason I checked this joint out. Definitely try the Philly Cheese Steak fries!"}
{"text":"Burgers are great here..  Its just super awkward inside. The workers just stare at you with no greeting, and theres no music playing so you must eat in silence Lol I had to ask the girl at the cashier if shes ready to take my order because she was just staring at the door"}
{"text":"I recently discovered this cool family-run little burger place tucked away in Kensington Market. My office is just around the corner and I went in to try their $8.99 combo special which includes a cheese burger, fries and a pop.  I was pleasantly surprised, the patties are freshly ground in-house (not from frozen) and cooked perfectly, juicy with just the right amount of colour (I hate overcooked burgers). The burger came with their special sauce which I really liked. It was a messy burger, but aren't all great food messy?! Now I know their basic cheese burger is so good, I can't wait to try their other burgers!  I also like the fries which seems to be also made in-house; it's thick cut with a crispy outside and with a soft centre, kind of like Harvey's fries but better (more crunch) and the perfect fries to have with salt and vinegar, if you are into that.  The staff is awesome and very friendly, it's so nice that you know they really care.  I'll definitely be back for my next burger fix, even though I'm now a selectarian (partial vegetarian) and only limiting myself to a day or two a week of meat, so this will be a real treat for me!"}
{"text":"THE BEST BURGER EVER!! This little gem of a restaurant hand makes the freshest, most delicious burgers I have ever ate in my entire life! They truly know their craft, and are able to deliver a unique and unforgettable dining experience. The owner Ozzy is a really kind and caring person who goes out of his way to make sure his customers are satisfied! 10/10 I will go again and again."}
{"text":"The word of mouth around Ozzy's Burgers has been pretty spectacular since it opened, so I knew I'd have to stop in sooner or later.  We arrived around 12:30 on a beautiful February afternoon and the place was pretty much empty, although it did fill up while we were eating. Though the menu is full of over-the-top concoctions, I wanted to see what their hamburger was like and how it compares to other top-tier joints around the city.  It's pretty good, but far from great.  I decided to go with The Classic (\"100% Canadian AAA Beef, Lettuce, Tomato, Pickle, Ozzy's Sauce\"). It's certainly quite an appealing burger in terms of its visuals; the patty boasts a beautiful crust, while the toppings were placed with care. But there are a few problems here, all involving the cook on the patty. For one thing, it's been salted way, way too heavily. And although the meat is quite juicy, my burger was cooked all the way to well done.  Aside from those issues, though, I enjoyed the heck out of this hamburger. And at $5 (!!!), it's a steal."}
{"text":"Such a cool place with a great vibe. OZZY is a super nice guy and his crew is very friendly. Burgers look amazing and taste delicious!"}
{"text":"the burgers are outstanding (chicken of course)  the poutine ruined the meal for me.  I've been struggling very much to come to this location for some food, as I have heard nothing but great things from friends of mine, this \"hole in the wall\" of a restaurant is tiny at best, but also open concept, you can literally see everything that is going on in the kitchen, and kudos to them because every single detail is taken care of, even something as simple as grounding up the meat and making handmade fresh patties.  I got my food in fast fashion, I'd have to say under 10 minutes as best. both chicken burgers were absolutely stellar in flavor and combination, my only complaint is the amount of sauce they use...completely overkill.  lots of napkins needed.  the poutine at this location is one of the worst poutine's I've ever had in my life, and I would put up any common burger place up against this poutine and they would be infinitely better. the problem I had the poutine came to me stone cold, the fries, the gravy, and of course the cheese. the fries were definitely from frozen, the gravy was from a pack, and the curds were not from quebec.  just an all around failure.  not impressed at all.  would go out of my way not to recommend this place until they sort out the poutine situation.   parking options are the streets and some nearby lots   lots of transit options within walking distance.   ***at the time of writing this restaurant doesn't have a website, just a facebook page which seriously needs to be worked on as well\""}
{"text":"Great Value/Price. Some pretty cool burgers in the menu. The triple patty burger is very large, but oily."}
