{"text":"Best halal pizza and wings loved it. It was super quick and food was really delicious."}
{"text":"The food and beer selection is amazing. We met John, the owner, and he couldn't have been more accommodating. Highly, highly recommended."}
{"text":"Learned they were from Philly. Ordered for carry out. We ordered the large red pizza (pepperoni) and Philly Cheese steak sub. Awsome! You could taste the sub roll was homemade and fresh as well as the pizza dough. The white American cheese made the Cheese steak really tasty. Going to tell all our friends!"}
{"text":"Went to Vegas for Labor Day weekend and they took really great care of us here! BEST PIZZA EVER! And I'm a pizza enthusiast! Great hosting and the music that was playing was calm and just what we needed after a day on the strip and before heading to Fremont! Great customer service! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Excellent halal food, friendly staff,should try Steak philly and chicken wings.
Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Good pizza would be better with chicken lol thanks for fixing the problem. Sorry for being a dick on the phone"}
{"text":"Friendly people  , I got a cheese steak sandwich it was good ,had better  and I even had a slice of pizza ,mmm that was good , you could till it was homemade :) I'll for sure go back for the pizza."}
{"text":"AMAZING!! I brought a veggie stromboli home thinking I would have my lunch for a week all taken care of, and all of my rugrats devoured the entire thing that night. If my kids (6) eat me out of house & home, I can just order some pizza from Grinders and use the HUGE pizza boxes for a shelter. The food here is fresh, the pizzas are big and tasty, and the owners are top-shelf when it comes to hospitality and their products. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place! A big thanks to John and his crew for always taking care of my family."}
{"text":"I've been to this location several times and loved the environment. I think it might be under new ownership but the food was so much better before. I use to be able to have a beer while I waited for my food not anymore. They couldn't get my order together and when they did they left out my drink. I just left will not go back there ever again"}
{"text":"I was really excited to order from here, but the pizza was very average! The price of the pizza is definitely not worth the taste. I more than likely will not order from here again. If I do, it won't be pizza."}
{"text":"Catering review

I recently had Grinder's cater our weekly business lunch and man did they deliver. Ordering was easy and they priced it perfectly. We had them bring 16 pizza's and 8 orders of wings. The pizza was perfect!  In fact, many of our employees made it a point to let me know that they loved the pizza!  They also said the wings were perfect... I love that they loved it. Makes it much easier to repeat the order in the future. 

I think I'm going to try some subs next time. 

As for pricing, I can tell you they are at the lower end of our weekly budget. These guys will work with you!  Can't wait for a couple weeks to pass so we can do it again!"}
{"text":"looks like everyone is giving a 5 star review. I have to agree. i'm from philly and always looking for a real cheesesteak. these guys have it. like others have posted, very great atmosphere. owners very friendly even when they got way busy. good luck to them. I will be back."}
{"text":"Go there for the Cheese Steak! It was so yummy and I am pretty picky when it comes to how much cheese is on there but they put the right amount and I loved it. I even had leftovers the next day and it was delicious. I gave it 4 stars because the fries are not good but other than that they are really friendly guys with a great concept of art and food!"}
{"text":"I went here when I first moved to Vegas and the pizza's are huge and the price is decent.  The person who owns it has wonderful customer service and provides great food for the price.  Due to his great customer service he has a customer for as long as I remain in Vegas."}
{"text":"Ewwww! Awful pizza.  My mom and I each ordered a personal pizza. I got pepperoni and ham and my mom got mushrooms and chicken toppings. 
The crust was doughy. I couldn't tell you what the sauce tasted like because the cheese was incredibly thick and we did not order extra cheese. The pizzas were not cooked long enough, it was cooked long enough to melt the cheese but not to give it any color. The meat was limp. 
Maybe the pizza was good at some point but not today. 
I gave them 2 stars because the delivery was quick."}
{"text":"THE BEST pizza I have had in a very long time. And the service was great they were very friendly."}
{"text":"Awesome experience. I don't know which was better, the staff & service or the food... everything was great. and affordable. best pizza and wings I have had in a long time"}
{"text":"Awesome food and superb customer service. Owners made you feel very welcome the moment you step inside. Great selection and large portions. Definitely stop by and check it out."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and great environment. The food was a different story, I was not impressed. Expected much more based on the yelp reviews."}
{"text":"New owners have a great selection. Loved the Jalape√±o poppers and onion rings. The best I had in Vegas."}
{"text":"We ordered a large pizza and calamari. The calamari was delicious and crispy. The pizza was great. Thanks for the ultra quick delivery!"}
{"text":"Grinders is a nice pizza joint it has An old Brooklyn pizza style atmosphere, I sat at bat top table and watch the pizza man spin and toss the Pizza dough right in front of my face .The friendliness Of the  workers was very nice and polite, the service was fast and clean and I got fresh hot delicious pizza, for a great price! grinders for a good pizza and a good job!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is what I like to call the perfect pizza (well for me). From the crust to the toppings etc..everything was on point. Customer service was quick and great as well and that's a huge plus for me. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I stopped by with my 2 little girls for a quick lunch.  I wasn't sure what to expect but as soon as we walked in we were welcomed by a handsome guy and the atmosphere was nice.  Even after my little ones spilled their drink, we were still taken care of with a smile. The pizza was delicious and the service was amazing. We will be coming back :)"}
{"text":"Best Pizza in Vegas. Tried the Margarita & Double Pepperoni Pizza and they were both great. Employees are helpful and friendly. Great place to take a family."}
{"text":"What a joke.  Walk in with 2 different coupons and they don't accept either the Entertainment book or Restaurant.com because it was old management that did those.  Considering that there were NO customers at 12:30 on a Sunday afternoon you would think they would make an effort to put people in the restaurant.  I would never go back!"}
{"text":"Best pizza  ive had by far....philly cheese steak with fresh made/baked bread..DELICIOUS"}
{"text":"Where do I start.  The food is just completely terrible. I do not believe any of the positive reviews posted. You can try their food for yourself and see how terrible it is, however do not waste your money. I do not know how this place is in business and again the initial perception you get is positive due to the reviews but do not be mislead. I am not too picky when it comes to food and I rarely leave reviews, but this place was so bad that I need to let everyone know."}
{"text":"I ordered take out and when I showed up (at the time they told me to come) to pick up my wings and pizza, I was told that a delivery driver accidentally took it, Rather than start making me replacement food, they decided they should just wait to see if the delivery driver brought the food back \"after while.\" W.T. Serious F.?. 

No apology. No coupon. No attempt to make things right. They didn't even offer to make my food again. They just told me to sit down and see if the driver ever brought my food back (after it rode around town for a while getting cold and nasty).

Worst customer service ever. I don't care if the food tastes like Jesus' delicious candy tears, I will never go back.

Grinders is hereby on the permanent blacklist. Further, it is cordially invited to lick my balls forevermore."}
{"text":"I live a few blocks away but today was the first time I've tried Grinders. Service was awesome and very friendly. I ordered the meat lovers and it was perfect. Crust was nice and thin and the toppings were in perfect proportion. 

I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The buffalo pizza was amazing and the service was friendly and really paid attention to detail. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Very friendly location owners have a great personality and make everyone feel welcomed. I had the calamari and the burger sandwich with a Wahoo beer from a San Diego brewery. A must for me to return for the pizza...."}
{"text":"Excellent wings & calzones!!!
The family running this joint truly cared about our dining experience"}
{"text":"This is a great place for pizza and beers.  The owners and staff welcome you as you enter and make you feel right at home.  Good food from Pizza's to salads.  Some cool art work on the walls too by local artists."}
{"text":"Was craving pizza, found this place and let me tell you it was awesome!  As soon as we walked in the owner welcomed us with a friendly smile.  He went over the menu. We got the wings,  a burger sandwich with fries (best sandwich ever) and a personal serving white pizza with mushrooms,  olive, and spinach....amazing!! The crust was really good.  We will definitely go back for 2nds, 3rds and 4ths....lol.."}
{"text":"I really love the pizza here. They cook it right in front of you. They are very clean and the owner even took the time to approach us and gave us free dessert!

We drove from the north east just to taste this pizza and it's well worth the drive and the price! It's way better than your average pizzas it and papa jons.

Don't take my word for it, try it they def. deserve 4.5 or 5 stars!"}
{"text":"AMAZING Food!!! I got pizza (melts in your mouth) it was the best slice I have had in Vegas. My husband got a calzone soooooo delicious!!! The ricotta cheese was an overload of goodness!! I highly recommend it here. Great food here, even better service! Amazing workers here!"}
{"text":"Not only are these some of the best sandwiches in the city, these guys are also some of the most welcoming owners I've ever encountered. Hanging out at this place is more comfortable than any restaurant I've been to. They always make you feel welcome and at home. Great job guys."}
{"text":"Roast Pork Sandwich is my favorite and they have pizza by the slice!

The guys are warm and friendly.  Great bread for the sandwiches, this is my second visit, first review.  Glad they are in the neighborhood.

Delivery is coming soon, can't wait!

It's still new, so far, so good."}
{"text":"Ordered a Calzone, which was made fresh right in front of me. Excellent taste, crust was just right, not too heavy. Will definitely be ordering from here again!"}
{"text":"In shock!!!!!!!! Only found this place cause it's next mixers(best ice cream ever). Gave it a shot cause my local pizza place been pissing me off. Once you try the pizza, calzones or sandwiches you WILL BE HOOKED. I have become a pizza snob. Crust bubbles is an option!!!!!! Really!!! it just so happens my wife judges pizza dough by crust bubbles and they have the best. Everything is made in house. Not because they told me because I watched them make the sauce and the dough is very fresh. Everyone who works there is really nice and they make you feel welcome. It is a nice change from other pizza places who seem irritated you are making them work. I now eat here at least once a week and not once have I had a bad experience."}
{"text":"The food was great but the customer service was exceptional.. We ordered pizza and calamari and fries. So perfectly crunchy! Pizza was hot and so tasty!"}
{"text":"These guys have great customer service. I'm a repeat customer and I never had a yelp. These guys told me to because once you check in they give you a free drink. The pizza here is the best I had. The crust is made just right and it's not undercooked. This is my favorite pizza spot for sure"}
{"text":"It was ok. 
That's about it.
Was looking forward to trying this place but it comes in at average.
Love the waitress, her name was Modest, but I
don't see a reason to go back.
Some suggestions -- Make a larger pizza and cover it with cheese.
Don't serve warm beer.

Maybe I caught a bad night. 

Romans 10
8 But what does it say? \"The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart\" (that is, the word of faith which we preach): 9 that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. 11 For the Scripture says, \"Whoever believes on Him will not be put to shame.\" 12 For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him. 13 For \"whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.\""}
{"text":"Grinder's was recommended to us by a friend and we are glad we listened.  We really enjoyed our experience. 

Upon arriving we were greeted by the chef and sat at a table. The menu was simple but varied. 

We started with the calamari appetizer. The chef made it in the kitchen while we watched.  It was served with some lemon slices and some marinara sauce. I liked it with out the sauce. It was that tasty!  It was not at all greasy and had the perfect amount of flavor. 

Next we ordered a creation I like to call the back room pizza. We got a large red sauce (you can choose red or white) pizza with banana peppers, cheese, pepperoni, mushrooms, tomato, spinach and topped it with Ricotta cheese.  When the chef delivered it, it looked like a work of art. You could tell he enjoyed making it.  The dough is a perfect balance between thin and thick. We like our pizza well done on the bottom but not overly cooked and Grinders delivered!  The first bite and we knew we had found a great pizza place!  We ate about half and took the rest home for dinner another night. 

All in all, I think this place is a secret that needs to get out."}
{"text":"Trying this again cause evidently my first edition of the review was not yelpish enough...

Finding this hidden treasure was a definite score for us. Grinders (sub sandwiches for those of you from the west coast) made using fresh (and extremely delicious) bread and amazing ingredients. I had the Chicken Salad and the wife had the Philly Cheesesteak. Both were delightful slices of heaven. The price was very reasonable. With a friendly crew running the place, ¬†we felt like family. The decor was accented by art from a local artist, that you could buy off the wall. Give it a try. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by for lunch to try the Italian grinder and french fries, all of the food was great !  Nice sandwich on homemade bread,and good fries. We were also treated to a nice sample of AWESOME backlava.
Excellent service,nice staff, and the family of new owners are very nice and welcoming. We wish them the very best in their new venture."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, the place was clean and decorated, the service was very kind, the prince is affordable to anyone.
I recommend to all my friends and family.
Thank you guys for a great experience, I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I ate a delicious pizza I have ever had. It's a cozy place to hang out with friends. I didn't expect a pizza restaurant like this even. We ate a lot, baklava was free though:) close and fast service, I liked that place. Definitely must try their pizza and deserts."}
{"text":"Customer service was absolutely non-existent. It is a real shame because the food was actually good and we would have ordered from them again. We ordered from Eat24 through them and they tried to blame everything on them. First time we got a call saying they were out of baklava no apologies or sorry for the trouble they said they would call Eat24 for us and then they said that we needed to call them a half an hour later. When we received our food, we paid for chicken on our salad and it was not there and we also paid for salami on our pizza and there was barely any we called to see what happened and they wanted us to send everything back and wait for another order to come... We had just moved and had a seven-year-old who was starving I'm not going to make her wait another 45 minutes for food. No apologies nothing very rude wouldn't let us talk to the manager and acted like we were bothering him needless to say I won't be back."}
{"text":"We were heading towards another pizza place which was closed on a Sunday evening for no obvious reason. So we ended up at this place which turned out to be a very good choice. The stuff welcomes us warmly and have us a hand on picking a pizza which comes in two sizes: small and gigantic. We created our own pizza with salami, jalape√±os and olives and while we were waiting for the food we had a really interesting chat with the international stuff (Mexico, turkey, Iran etc.). So waiting 15 minutes for our order wasn't a big deal at all. The pizza itself was good. Crunchy with lots of ingredients. The dough was a bit dry though but I anyway could not manage the eat the edge. Highly recommendable. Pizza in delivery is possible too."}
{"text":"GPL is EXACTLY what I've been WAITING FOR to hit Las Vegas. This is \"hipster heaven\". The co-owner/server (John Anthony) is warm, personable, attentive, and quick on his feet. Every restaurant in Las Vegas should have a dude like John running things. He's everything the dining industry needs.

What we had: 
a slice of cheese pizza  $2.50
1/2 cheese steak sandwich (with shoestring fries)  $7.49
1/2 B.L.T. (with shoestring fries)  $6.99
2 Mango Teas  $4
1 Ninkasi Lux Lager (beer) (John recommended)  $5
Total w/ tax = $27.68

The food was great, no complaints. The fries were better than McDonald's and in the same style... only without all the chemical additives. The 1/2 sandwiches are large enough that you' think they were WHOLE. So skimping here. The pizza was good too. Not too greasy.

My wife loved her B.L.T.. The beer was on point. There are a lot of activities and things that go on here so it's cool to stay tuned in."}
{"text":"I paid over $45.00 dollars for two of their sandwiches, of which the bread was hard and the calamari was a few handful's and greasy as all hell for an additional charge over almost 10 bucks... I will not be ordering from them again. My sandwich had more mayo than it had meat.. NEVER again!"}
{"text":"Looks like this business has been sold and it is not the same. The cheese steak is not being made the same anymore. Went from a place that I always wanted to go to a place that I will not be going back too."}
{"text":"OMFG!!!  This place is a must. I was a chef for 24 years. The sandwiches are the absolute bomb. Warning, if you try the pork sandwich first, you are in danger of not trying anything else. You should experience the beer list.  By the way, any place where there is always an owner greeting you; the food will be exceptional. 

Say hi to Rick and John when you get there. 

PS give Modest a big tip."}
{"text":"The owner makes everything from scratch. The meatball sub is, I think, easily the best in the city. Staff and owner are extremely friendly and personable. This has become one of my families favorite spots to eat!!!!"}
{"text":"Last night was my first experience at Grinders, and my fiancee and I will definitely be going back! 

As soon as we walked in the door, everyone behind the counter literally stopped what they were doing to look up to say hi and welcome us! 

Our server, Modest, gave us some of the best service we've ever had in Las Vegas, hands down!  Unfortunately, Las Vegas isn't necessarily known for its service culture, however, we felt welcomed like family, and Modest's easy-going affability made our experience truly memorable!

The Caesar salad was great; awesome Caesar dressing that tastes like it's made in-house. The pizza was phenomenal. We had bacon, onion, extra cheese. Flavors were fantastic, perfect ratio of sauce to ingredients, and the crust was cooked perfectly; not too crispy, nor too doughy! 

The overall feel of the restaurant is laid back and perfect for the casual night out we were seeking, the service is top-notch, and the food was fantastic, so we most definitely will be making it one of our regular dinner spots!

We're looking forward to going back soon!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Not only is the food phenominal but the people who run it are like the cherry on top of the sundae. My recommendation....pork sandwich. Get Porked at Grinders.  :)"}
{"text":"Loved this place! We stumbled upon it and what a great choice. The wings are good and the pizza was really good too! We also had a Stromboli and cannoli which were both great! Service was very good and attentive. We will be back!"}
{"text":"You are welcomed as soon as you enter, by the owners. They are glad to see you. 
The one owner, I wish I knew his name, asked if we had been there before. We stated we had not. He went over his menu with us. The menu is small, but that is ok, I prefer that over a million choices. 
We chose a seat in this nicely decorated restaurant. I liked the feel of it. There was plenty of space between tables, a nice bar counter area. Very clean place.
We chose the cheese steak sandwich we got the whole sandwich and split it. It came with French fries. My husband also got a slice of cheese pizza. He also ordered one of the craft beers. 
The pizza beer and my soda came out fast. 
My husband enjoyed his slice. He stated great pizza. 
Our sandwich soon arrived and even half was huge. The fries a great size portion of golden crispness. 
The taste of the sandwich was delicious. I prefer American cheese on my steak sandwich that with the onions and wonderful bread, made a hearty meal. The half was too much for me. The sandwich could easily feed three people.
The owners were so kind explained all of the events they will have. We talked about we are all originally from. 
The other customers were joining in. 
This place was a real comfortable place to be with good food, great people. 
I will be back , I have to try the Pizza!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch and was immediately greeted and seated by the owner at the bar. Place was small and it was nice to be able to have music and still be able to hear people talking. The pork sandwich was great, and they gave me a water with lemon even though i brought my own drink. I ordered a slice of pizza too which he warmed up. When he gave me the check he took off the pizza slice and said it was a little darker than what he wanted and didn't want me to pay for it. Thats someone who is passionate about their service and its a rare find."}
{"text":"This pizza lounge is a hidden gem! My boyfriend and I stopped by for our first time and we were pleasantly surprised at how great everything was. Caesar was good, romaine tasted fresh and loved the little croutons. Pizzas were super good! Lastly the cannolis were amazing! You have to try them, not being a big fan of cannolis to begin with these were so good! We even got a second order to go. Great food, great atmosphere and great service. If Modest is there you're bound to feel like family!"}
{"text":"The cheesesteak sandwich was amazing!  Great atmosphere and John was excellent.  Great family fun!!!"}
{"text":"I ate here with a group of six, including three teenagers. Everyone was very happy with their food. My daughter and I split the pork and spinach sandwich. It was outstanding and we both took some home. One person got a pizza and said it was great. Two of the teenagers got slices of pizza which they personalized with several different toppings. The owner is very accommodating. The other teen had the turkey grinder and said it was very good. Our server was Modest and she is a sweetheart. Go!  You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"The beer is great and food is delicious. Plus, modest is an amazing server and will make you smile"}
{"text":"Great pizza.  I had a sausage and peppers pizza and it was delicious.  Everyone there is really nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Decided to support a neighborhood pizza joint for lunch today as we heard they were having a RE-grand opening with new management. We tried the pepperoni pizza, white garlic pizza with chicken and a Philly cheesesteak. Pepperoni pizza sauce was fresh, had some good herbs (could taste some basil) overall good and enjoyed the beef pepperoni. The white pizza sauce was tasty, could be a little strong for some with fresh garlic but we liked it. Philly was really nice and toasty, good quality and great bang for the buck!  Overall happy to support Pizza place close to my office. Nice people working there so I will be back to try some more items soon!"}
{"text":"Seriously THE BEST cheesesteak in town!!!  I grew up in Philly and have lived in Las Vegas for a long time and have never been able to find anything close to a real cheesesteak.  We got a coupon in the mail awhile back and tried it one night with my parents and have been going back every week or so since!!  Also, the pizza is so ridiculously delicious!  The staff is wonderful too!  No complaints!  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"The pizzas look good and I was ready to try this place as I like discovering new, family owned, neighborhood restaurants. I was having my car detailed across the street and walked in with my emotional support dog (tiny, quiet 3lb dog in a shoulder bag). I was met with, \"Your dog can't be in here!\" So I left. A simple \"sorry\" and \"thanks\" would have been nice and I would have walked out and came back another time. But the sentence was delivered without a hint of humanity. (Maybe offer a to-go menu or delivery options. Maybe ask if this dog is a service dog) There was not another customer in the restaurant. 

I'll never know how good the food is. Sorry, but this restaurant just lost my support on customer relations alone."}
{"text":"The pizza is soooooo good. I love that they have the white sauce option since I'm allergic to tomatoes.  It nice bring able to order a pizza without the hassle of have to explain my allergy. This is my new favorite. The people here are so friendly. Great food, great people :)"}
{"text":"Stopped into Grinders for lunch with 3 other co-workers on a Friday noon. Had great service from one of the owners. Took the time to explain everything to us. 2 ordered pizzas & 2 ordered sandwiches. While I thought my sandwich could have used more flavor one of the other pizzas I thought was great. The other sandwich eater loved their sandwich. I also ate there on their grand opening about a year ago & thought the food was great. Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, pizza by the slice available even at night! Too many places only offer slices for lunch specials, which is ridiculous. The dimmed lighting, bar seating, and friendly staff really make this a lounge.

Standard cheese slice is $2.50, extra toppings available to add on for 50 cents each- liked that the pie wasn't as greasy as others in the area, but felt it was a bit dried-out. Could use a touch more cheese and sauce.

The staff are really great here though- welcoming and friendly, which I don't see nearly often enough in Vegas. Menu also includes a bunch of tasty-looking sandwiches, as well as calzones/strombolis, and desserts."}
{"text":"This food taste like cafeteria food we just ordered the cheesecake is frozen the fries were microwaved the pizza was disgusting this was a waste of money completely go order from somewhere else this is gross bro"}
{"text":"Best place, best good and, awesome service. Ahmad has great hold and he always make food perfect."}
{"text":"Pizza was delicious, pepperoni was amazing and different then your average place. Customer service was exceptional friendly."}
{"text":"Good pizza for a good price. Clean and simple decor. Everybody here seems cool. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Skeptical to start with new management, but was greeted at the door and warmly welcomed. Reasonable menu and prices. Had the Greek pizza, BBQ pizza, and the got wings. Hot wings were excellent and a great price. BBQ pizza was tangy and irresistible. The Greek pizza was of high quality and loved around the table. Service was top notch. They dished out the pizza, made recommendations and even brought out treats. They are awaiting an alcohol licence but welcomed us bringing our own and even poured it for us.  We will hands down return and can't wait until then. If you haven't eaten here then you're missing out. See you again soon delicious food coma.     Can't wait!"}
{"text":"AWESOME FOOD! great quality beers on draft polite locals friendly staff and the Buffalo Wings are out of this world!"}
{"text":"I've heard a lot of good things about this place, so we went there today for lunch to find out for ourselves.
We arrived 15 mins early, but the owner Rick let us in anyway and served us.  The place has a nice, clean look and gives you a pizza/deli atmosphere.  Rick was very helpful in helping us decide what to order, and gave us a little history about the establishment.
My wife ordered the White Pizza, and I had the Philly Cheesesteak.  The food arrived right away, and it was hot and fresh.  The Pizza was great, with lots of garlic flavor.  We added Spinach to ours, and it was the perfect flavor profile.  My cheesesteak was very good also, with lots of meat, and the rolls which were home made, were the kind you expect in a cheesesteak.
We really recommend this place and will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Located on Russell Road and Rainbow Blvd. It is directly behind Taco Bell.  Great food, pizza, wings, sandwiches.  The hamburger sub is my favorite. You can eat at the bar toss back a cold one as you watch your food being prepared.  The bread and the dough for the pizza crust...the best in the city.  Great atmosphere friendly staff you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"SUUUUPER AMAZING. The white sauce on the pizzas is so delicious.  The staff is so friendly and welcoming.  Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a hidden gem. The food is seriously amazing, authentic and homemade. The food takes a little longer than normal, but that's because they are truly prepping it from scratch. So yummy!!!!!! Definitely worth a try!!!!"}
{"text":"The food smelled great and the drinks were good but they food was deceiving by the smell because it tasted not so good ."}
{"text":"So I use to come her once a month and buy the 20pc wing mild oh my their amazing. And get the chicken strip and then one that best. But I always always have to get the philly chesse streak oh my that the best in town by far. I love it you have to try it when you come. And amazing customer service make me want to stay. I would love for all you guys to try the philly chesse streak"}
{"text":"I've ordered from here several times. I always get the cheeseburger grinder. It is delicious! They are always super friendly. The guy (owner?) can come off as a pushy salesman when he tries to get you to order extras or beer while you wait, but he's nice about it so it's weirdly uncomfortable for me. I would have given five stars but the pushiness is unpleasant. They also messed up and made me a Philly cheese steak instead of a cheesesburger grinder the last time I went. I realized when I got home and didn't feel like going back. Overall though, nice place, decent service and forgivable mistake so I'll keep ordering."}
{"text":"Ordered a large calzone and got a smaller one than we usually get, when we called to ask about this thinking its a mistake I was told this is the largest calzone they now serve . I normally order from here and the food is good but for 24 dollars the calzone size didn't seem large enough for me to order from here again."}
{"text":"ENOUGH!! Of all these fake reviews.. I can't freakin stand it.. This place wasn't good.  The pizza was below average.. Ingredients were of average quality.. Little too much cheese, crust was kinda dense and heavy.. Not crispy at all.. Sauce was super forgettable.. If you've been enlightened by a a premium pizza place, then there's just no reason to eat a sub par pizza anymore.. Furthermore.. I'm convinced it IS the water or something.. How come no one can make a decent philly cheese in vegas? The one I had was little bit too seasoned.. Bread tasted stale, kinda hard and cakey.. Meat was too lean, not juicy..FORGETTABLE EXPERIENCE.."}
{"text":"I was totally not impressed with this restaurant. The pizza tasted like it had been in the heating window for a long time before it was served....like hours. I was also not impressed with the price of the beer, $7 and $8 a pint. Not worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty bland. When we asked for pepperoni and sausage on 2 slices of pizza we received one slice with pepperoni and one slice of sausage. Which I suppose was a communication error but slightly annoying.
The cheesesteak was pretty terrible. No flavor or taste at all. It was a slice of cheese melted on the bottom of the white bread roll and onions with unseasoned meat. No peppers or anything. I thin the salt that should have gone on the sand which was instead given to the crappy frozen French fries. Seriously, I had to scrape the salt off the fries and couldn't even finish them.
Also, my husband ordered a soda and it was flat and the syrup was not distributed evenly so I think the machine needed recalibration. But they did give him canned soda instead so that was nice of them. 
I really wanted this place to be good but the food isn't good at all and I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Not sure why they have so many 4 star reviews."}
{"text":"Went here last night for the first time.  
Cool little spot with great food. Had the awesome calamari and a pizza with spinach.  Definitely my new pizza go to."}
{"text":"Grinders pizza was a nice little gem of a surprise just a crossed from the Hospital where we had a friend having surgery. The owners were very friendly and offered great service and good conversation.  the pizza was fresh made and it had a really good crust, well worth the $13.99 for the 14 inch pizza that serve two we ordered the supreme pizza and it was really really good but I will caution you their pepperoni is not American style pepperoniSo if you are not used to real Italian pepperoni you might not like it just be forewarned but note that everything else was excellent and I would definitely order from them again"}
{"text":"I got the wings and it was really good actually and such a good price, the lunch special had it come with a drink. My only problem was that it had another free drink offer on yelp if I check in but they said it wouldn't apply without an explanation. The yelp deal didn't come with any exclusions either. The seats were kind of hard but that really has nothing to do with the food. I loved the food!"}
{"text":"It was a carb loading kind of night before a big IM training day. I have this tradition that cheese pizza is my new go to. Thanks to my coach Nancy for the suggestion! It works just in case thinking of carb loading. Lol!!! 

I have always wanted to check out Grinders since right down the road from my house. My roommates have been there once and told me it was solid. Cheese pizza was on the menu so figure talk about the perfect timing. My first impression was kind of interesting set up cause really not much personality in the interior design. They do have one big widescreen hangs above the open kitchen area (if dine in can easily see anywhere), couple stand up chairs or lounge area (great spot if want see them do there magic making some pies, calzones, or whatever else on the menu), they had stand up refrigerator that they keep all the drinks (there nor fountain drinks it all by the can or bottle), and decent amount of seating for small restaurant. 

The cheese pizza got the large size to go. It was pretty good. Honest not much that goes into cheese pizza or ways that can mess it up. I have had bad ones just fyi. At Grinders the cheese pizza was solid. The crust was nice. It more think crust style pizza. The price you definitely get value for the size. 

The service was nothing but five stars. The gentlemen that took my order was friendly, positive vibes, and attentive. They also have free can of soda or drink that comes with check in. I found it little odd that he was like make good review..yay. It almost like they were not going honor the yelp check only if I do a review. It was going positive one anyway cause Grinders is place that definitely see coming back for another carb loading session. 

They do offer pizza by the slice."}
{"text":"Good fast and reasonably priced pizza.  I stopped eating the gluten so unfortunately have t been eating there lately.  It the perfect spot to grab a pizza and get the family fed after a long day."}
{"text":"Grinder ' s pizza is a very warm place very friendly, and service and food is great, will definetly be back, Philly cheesesteak and calzone were my favorites. Definetly best pizza in Las Vegas, this place should have 5 stars no arguements. Also good for students 5$ special should definetly be checked out."}
{"text":"John, I can't believe I didn't find you and your incredible food and beer till this week.  Excellent pork and spinach grinder! The cheeseburger grinder was so amazing that not only did I have for lunch (1st time) on Wednesday but again for dinner tonight.  The cheesestake my daughter had was one of the best ever I've ever had.  The fries were salty and crispy and perfect. 

The bread you make and use for the sandwiches takes your delicious fresh ingredients to the next level.

I can't wait to try the pizza next time.  Both white and red pizza with so many fresh toppings to choose from and slices. So nice to be able to order slices all day and night.

I also loved all the rock photos on display.

If you can't tell, I love this place.  So much so that I am yelping for the very first time.

If you want an amazingly delicious taste sensation, incredibly welcoming environment, Grinders is for you.
I can't wait to take my friends and clients."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! Slightly different but nothing ugly or uncomfortable. I loved how their restroom had beautiful cool photos, smelt good and clean. They also had beautiful awesome artwork on the walls. Felix the cat and other cartoon canvases. Also had beautiful photos of NYC. I loved it all 

My husband and I both love pizza and this place truly left us both satisfied. Pizza slices are a good size! Big enough we were left with left-overs (who doesn't love bomb left-over pizza!?) The service was nice, they made sure we were satisfied and yet we became friends with some of the men who worked there.."}
{"text":"Great pizza, better waitress 
Myself and friend found this place cross from the my house . I have yet to find pizza that compares to my childhood NY favorites but this ranks among the best in Las Vegas. It's on par with pizza rock and is far bette than metro in my opinion. I don't care people who talk bad . I believe my self. Do you ever find yourself eating a meal that in just too good to waste with idle chatter? You just dig in and don't allow for interruptions until your done ? This was that! 
Our service was also outstanding. The waitress was very friendly and helpful. He gave us the perfect amount of attention. Before we last he made us aware of all the weekly specials and invited us back. Given the great food and service. 
We will come back for sure!!))"}
{"text":"?What an absolute find!

We felt welcomed as soon as we opened the door. Warm friendly smiles and awesome aromas.

Modest was our server. I could write this entire review just about her. Loved her. 

We shared a Ceasar Salad, Chicken Philly and a Pizza. So much food, but so good. 
The Ceasars was pretty basic, but tasty. We both really enjoy the Philly and such a bonus that it was chicken. It was flavorful and on great bread. The pizza was NY style. Big slices that packed flavor and a great dough. Plus, you can buy it by the slice or pie and custom make!

Definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"This spot is a gem.  Neighborhood feel and super friendly owners that seem to be very  passionate about everything they do.  I've never had even an average meal.  It's always been fantastic.  Salads, pizza, and sandwiches tastes great and made with love.  Place also has quality beverage selections, craft beers, wine, etc.  Try the Philly Cheese steak Pizza!"}
{"text":"Ordered bbq chicken pizza and had no flavor not very good at all . Have ordered before and it's always just been ok. Probably won't be ordering again."}
{"text":"Today was the third day in a row I came in for lunch. Fatty, I know, but I've had good experience so far and there were more things I wanted to try. The pizza is really good! The dough isn't overly chewy, it's soft and tasty. I also tried the cheeseburger sub and it was just as good as all the reviews I read. I personally think that burger sub could also be made with pizza sauce and some onions and/or peppers and be awesome as well. The bread, I was over hearing, is made in house and with filtered water (I believe). It sounds as though every ingredient has been thoroughly thought out to include only the highest quality. I did pizza again today but only because I needed to get back to work. There are a couple other sandwiches I really want to try and because I'll be stuck on the same project for the next sixteen days, I assume I'll have plenty of time to try those.

Here's the thing: the guys working in there were completely friendly and helped me get in and out within the thirty minutes I was afforded on each occasion. The price was right, the place is nice inside, and my overall experience was just really good. I've driven past for months without a thought simply because previous tenants in that spot weren't my favorites but I'm glad I made it in. And I believe it will be a good place to bring my kids back to, even if it's across town from us."}
{"text":"We came across Grinders by accident.  I'm so glad we did!  I got the Stromboli, which was amazing.  The personal size was really big.  Grinders has the best marinara I've found in Vegas, and the crust was just right--not too thick or too thin.  My husband got a cheesesteak, which was great, too.  A half size was just right (because he helped me finish my Stromboli). If you go away hungry, it's your own fault!"}
{"text":"Had a random pizza craving the other day and this local spot popped up a few blocks from my house. Ordered pizza and wings to go. Wings were especially nice, I enjoyed the flavor of the spicy sauce. The person working was awesome, I'll come back just from my pleasant interaction with him. He mentioned that they are coming out with some new menu options soon including adding pasta. I'll be back to try the sandwiches and check out the pasta."}
{"text":"Wow!! What an awesome jewel of a pizza place.  

I went in on Super Bowl Sunday, and was politely informed that I would have to sit at the bar because they had a 3PM buy out of the entire place. 

There were two guys from Philly there, I assume they are the owners.  Super nice. You could tell they were busy creating some amazing food, but still promptly sat me and got me a drink.  I ordered the Pork Sandwich, and a caesar salad! Dang the food was delicious!

Several people came and went, the owners greeted them like they were family!  For sure a place I cant wait to come visit again."}
{"text":"Met some friends with our kids at Grinders.  Food was fantastic!  Highlights were the meatballs, pizza and cannoli.  The service was above and beyond friendly!  Relaxed environment and very clean.  Will be coming every time we are in town."}
{"text":"We went there for a quick bite of pizza.
The place is really friendly, and apparently the owner is the one that works to keep the people happy. And it looked like he really cares about he's customers. 
Good vibrations!! Great pizza! For amazing price. 2 pizza slices  and a soda for 5 bucks!"}
{"text":"***This place has new owners*** Old owner had great food and great service. New owners have no customer service and awful pizza :( Its not NY style pizza any more. The pepperoni wasn't even good, how do you mess that up?! It tasted like salami. Garlic bread was unimpressive and it came with a side of ranch... what kind of pizza place serves ranch with garlic bread?!  I'm sad that I won't be going back there. The old owners were great but these new guys get  One more thing the to go box the garlic bread came in says \"muchas gracias\""}
{"text":"Pizza was pretty great, the staff was friendly and made suggestions when I came in to pick up my order and talked like I had been there 100 times. Nice place."}
{"text":"I love Grinders!  Bobby is having the cheesesteak which I will have a bite of and I am getting the pork sandwich. SO GOOD! I also like how it is small and quaint, tastefully decorated and pristine clean!"}
{"text":"I must dine in if you love your pizza!  Owners are hands on, super nice and amazing food! Def one of my must do's!"}
{"text":"Same old name under new ownership! Let me tell you as a man that has worked in the industry for over a decade that the owner personally made my pizza with love. Everything tasted so fresh and the sauce and cheese were not skimped on or disregarded! I was greeted by the friendliest of owners.  Ahmed.  We tried the pizza and it was amazing. I have to come back to try the fresh from scratch meatballs and Philly cheese steak pizza!!! Clean well kept dining area, and a genuinely friendly owner with a passion and dedication to all things fresh! If you havent been in the last few months I suggest you give grinders another go!"}
{"text":"I always check the reviews on restaurants before I decide to eat in the place well this pizza place had a lot of good reviews so decided to give it a try and let me tell you!!! I was not disappointed the staff is very friendly I ordered a pizza half white half red sauce omg it was delicious !!! Not grease just perfect the crust was good not to soft not to crispy also not grease was perfect the ingredients were fresh I can tell by the taste and the sauce Wowww it was just delicious you can tell it's home made and not from a cane like other places ,I also had the chicken wings mild the mild sauce was just perfect, if you want to have a really good pizza and chicken wings because not everyone makes with fresh ingredients you should try this place !!! I will definitely recommend and came back to try more from there menu!!!!!"}
{"text":"Best meatball grinder I've ever had!!! It's just pure paradise and the people working there are welcoming and funny!!! Had a great time here I highly recommend this tiny local spot.."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery tonight, 24 inch special w/pepperoni 20 pc wings and a 2 liter. Order was delivered right at the time promised,loved that but I really really wanted to love this pizza too since all the reviews seem so positive & its so close to home but pizza was a mess,cold and worst of all burnt! Now all the pictures I have seen are for smaller sized pizzas, maybe that's the reason? The wings were so plain, I did order mild but even then just no flavor there! For the 2 liter I selected pepsi but got coke, no biggie as we like both. We won't be ordering anytime soon."}
{"text":"I really don't like giving businesses reviews that aren't good, but I can't lie either! I found this spot while searching for pizza and wings on a Saturday night. We arrived, ordered, and it took them about 20 minutes to get our food ready. Not bad, right? Also, it was the gentleman behind the bar that took our order and he was very polite.

We ordered pizza (large pep and sausage), wings, and calamari. The pizza was good. I was especially hungry at the time too, so that might affect my judgement, but it was good. It was a lot thinner than I usually like though. The wings were the best thing we had. Great flavor, but will definitely get soggy if left in the wing sauce too long (ours started to after just 15 minutes). I'll ask for wing sauce on the side next time. 

The calamari was the worst item we had. I love calamari and I have had it at almost every restaurant I've been to that serves it. First of all, it was soggy. Second of all, it tasted like it had no salt or pepper on it. It was just so lackluster and disappointing, especially since this item was raved about on Yelp reviews.

All of this came out of ~$45 and it was not worth it. Unfortunately, I probably won't go back. Maybe they were just having a bad day?"}
{"text":"The calamari was tender and perfectly crispy, the Greek pizza was huge and delicious, and the staff was remarkably friendly and attentive! Absolutely worth your time to check out this lovely little family-run establishment."}
{"text":"There are new owners. Much better quality food, prices for food are amazing, all meat 100% halal! A hard find in vegas!"}
{"text":"Great food!!!! pizza, wings, sandwiches, salads and more. I eat here all the time my favorite chicken Caesar salads are the best, and so is all their other food."}
{"text":"Sad. This place had the most amazing Greek pizza. I was hospitalized at Kindred next door and craving pizza for the Super Bowl. Figured this place would work because not only was it very close but it was unknown, so it wouldn't be too busy on such a popular pizza day. Ordered the Greek with white sauce. Amazing!

That was the beginning of February. Two months- only two months later- and they have changed their menu. They only offer individual slices or 16\" pies. They have changed everything to be cheese plus toppings. I believe it's new ownership/management. Otherwise it's at least new employees. I get that it happens. I do. So I swear the single star isn't just because of that. The single star is because when I called to order the employee could not understand me and I couldn't understand him. It's not just a thick accent, it's another language. And no attempt to put a different employee on the phone. So instead of a quick call, my husband has to physically drive over there to attempt to order in person. He gets there and calls me while attempting to order. I can hear that it's the same employee. My husband can't understand what he is saying either. He and the man have to use their arms and hands and point to attempt any communication. This is not appropriate, and definitely not functional. Put someone in the front of house who can communicate in English. That's all I ask."}
{"text":"I am going to give GRINDERS five stars, we would order from them again,we ordered pizza and wings to be delivered at 4|:30. They were on time, the pizza was hot and the wings were very good. It was a great touch the sides of hot pepper , garlic powder and cheese!  We are from New York so we know great pizza, the pizza was okay"}
{"text":"Pizza is great! The guys who worked there were very nice. The place was clean and nicely decorated!

I'll def be coming here again!
My very picky 3 year old daughter even loved it!"}
{"text":"We ordered a large pizza with 4 toppings. Not sure if we received $8 in toppings but the pizza was just OK. Was not impressed by any means, but the guy who worked there was nice. Might try the sandwiches next time to give this place another go."}
{"text":"I have always been satisfied with their service as well as the food. If you want good Gyro and kabob platters this is the place. Working across the street is convenient for me. If I can't make it to eat in at the restaurant, then delivery is a call away. Try it for yourself!"}
{"text":"We ordered pepperoni pizza, mild wings, cheesy bread and fries. Everything was good. The pizza was great! Felt like a nice family establishment. Everyone was friendly and the service was good.  We will come back"}
{"text":"Our pizza was requested thin crust.  It was freshly made, with the right amount of sauce and the cheese was perfectly baked. The crust was also baked crusty. Reminded me of NYC pizza. Great service. Two flat screen TV to watch while they cook your food."}
{"text":"It was pretty good- not sure if I'll be be back though. I just wasn't feeling it- if you know what I mean? I really enjoy going to family owned places when I'm hungry- I love to support local owners."}
{"text":"I've ordered here a couple times and loved the food but  this last time was ridiculous. I called to check my order hab been  already an hour and 15min I order a personal pizza and salad I live around the corner from the place, so I called and they guy said the driver was lost fine I told him the address. So then another 20 min past so I called and canceled . They start blowing up my phone calling then texting and then have the nerve to text they don't want MY business are u serious said it's my fault I had the guy out lost for hrs cuz I didn't put the apt number! I can't believe it. If that was an employee or the owner but he didn't speak English well so not sure. I WILL NEVER order again. UNBELIEVABLE!  They could have called and asked if they were lost instead they wait 2hrs so i call and cancle the order and text me telling my not come back they want my business and I call them because I'm upset they text me that and he argues saying it's my fault it's my fault and hangs up. GOOD LUCK ordering from there"}
{"text":"Great staff, very nice owner. Pizza are very good and give great recommendation. I took half pizza with white sauce and the other half pepperoni. Both sides were amazing. Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"Originally stopped at Pizzalicious down the street, when I pulled up the sign said open but no workers were inside. Instead, they were all sitting outside around a table smoking and lounging so I figured they were closed. 

Opened up my Yelp app and saw Grinders was just a block away and they were still open! I was craving chicken wings and some fried zucchini so it was a perfect spot. 

Walked in to a very clean dining area and counter. The man working was extremely friendly and helped me with the menu since it was my first time. He was very thorough with describing menu items including portion sizes. What I wasn't expecting was the same man actually would be preparing my food! Come to find out, he's the new owner of the restaurant!! I was amazed at the level of service, truly awesome first experience. 

I ordered the mild wings, fried zucchini, fries, and zeppolis. Everything was sooooo good! Wings were a nice size and very tender. Zucchini had a nice breading and the portion size was more than enough for two people. 

Highly recommend trying this spot out! Ahmed is the name of the manager, say hi when you visit he's awesome!  (I hope I got the spelling right)."}
{"text":"I'm not too big on pizza but this place made me change my mind.  they use fresh ingredients!  while other places use frozen pre-made dough, this place uses dough made before your eyes.  i recommend the pizza by the slice.  I have yet to try their other dishes like their hot sandwiches."}
{"text":"Tried ordering a supreme and cheese pizza - kept getting upsold combos we didn't want then got there 30 mins later as quoted and they hadn't even started on the order - went to the European deli next door"}
{"text":"This place is really good! The bread is home made, so of course the pizza and subs are great. I personally like the cheesesteak and cheeseburger sub. They also have a good selection of craft beer. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"This is a great place in a not so great shopping center, but don't let that deter you.  Went there last night with my kids and my brother and was immediately greeted with a huge \"Welcome\" from the person behind the counter, which I later learned was the owner John.

Ordered fries and pizza.  Fries were good, looked like ordinary fries, but they were perfectly seasoned and tasted great.

Pizza was good as well.  The make all the bread in house for their sandwiches and have a water treatment system to take the nasties out of the water so it tastes better when you make dough.  Soft Drinks also tasted great as did the Firestone DBA on draft.  Bill was $43 with a 20% tip.  We will be back.

This place is worth a trip.  Only negative, and it is no unique to them is that a large pizza seems to have shrunk over the years.  Seems kind of small, but it is like that everywhere.  Prices were good, owners working there and cared about the quality and service was good.  A winner with me."}
{"text":"Chicken salad was delicious. Crunchy fresh lettuce just how I like it. Buffalo chicken pizza was amazing as well!"}
{"text":"Ordered and picked up from here just because it was across the street from the hospital my mother spent a few days, and was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. Ditto on the hospitality from the owner. He was great and seemed to have a passion for making a good pie. Food wise, the crust is more on the cracker style than chewy, but it goes well with lots of toppings. All in all a great pizza."}
{"text":"Ordered from Grinders last night for delivery. My husband chose the tenders combo and a friend and I shared a calzone. The delivery was quick and the food was great. The tenders were cooked well and sauced perfectly. I loved the calzone. We kept it simple with pepperoni and ricotta. The dough was light and cooked nicely, not too hard or tough like some others I've had. I'm sure we will be ordering again."}
{"text":"The owner is a friendliest welcoming person in the industry , ideal for great customer service . Amazing quality food fresh and cooked to order. I highly recommend the cheese burger sub n there pizza have this warm outstanding balance of  the perfect crust and topped with just the perfect amounts of sauce and great quality toppings . I live in anthem and hopefully they expand and open a grinders on my side of town. For a great meal just go visit they don't dissapoint."}
{"text":"Outstanding service & excellent food! Definitely my favorite pizza spot :) love there calamari & yummy doughnut dessert  a place I would recommend to try!"}
{"text":"THis places was great!  Yummy pizza and wings, only thing their delivery guy took almost twice as long as they quoted.  But super yummy and friendly customer service!"}
{"text":"My fianc√© am I were looking for a good place to eat yummy pizza and drink a beer. We are so happy with this place!!!! They were super friendly,  I had the best beer of my life and the pizza was fresh, perfectly cooked. 

The beer was very, very good. Their menu is simply, fresh and yummy, modern and clean place. Their Doughnuts for dessert were amazing. We ended up love g this place and for this reading I'm giving it 5 starts. Ir deserve it! So happy for having this pizzaria in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Great pizza, I come all the way from L.A just for this pizza and the staff is great everything was great I can't wait till next time"}
{"text":"Ordered online through Slice and was told it would take 30-45 minutes for delivery. An hour and a half later, we finally had our cold pizza in hand. We had to call twice to see where our pizza was and on the second time we were forced to listen in on a very awkward conversation between employees. We ordered the Alfredo pizza with chicken and bacon and the meatlovers. The alfredo was lacking in flavor, but the meatlovers was actually pretty good."}
{"text":"Man, I really dislike writing negative reviews, but I wish I could give this place a negative star. STAY AWAY FROM THIS SHADY BUSINESS. 

My wife and I were in the Spring Valley area on Friday night, and she was in the mood for a calzone. She was browsing through their pictures, and she noticed that they only had calzones with ham and ricotta cheese. She wanted to confirm so she called in and the employee that picked up said that she can put whatever she wants inside the calzone. Hmmm. She also asked what kind of cheese it comes with, and oddly enough, he said it comes with mozzarella, not ricotta. Ok, we were hoping this guy was right, because he was also really rude and tried to rush us off the phone. So my wife ordered a calzone with pepperoni and mozzarella cheese, and when we arrived at the store to pick it up, the person that was making our calzone (looked like he could be the owner or manager) said that they are only accepting cash, because their card system is down. Wtf. When I asked him if they had an ATM machine, he looked at me all dazed and confused like I'm a foreigner in his country. Dafuq bro? No speak English? And seriously, you couldn't tell us this over the phone before we got to the store?

So listen, not only did we have to draw out cash and come back, but they made the calzone incorrectly. So intuitively, as soon as my wife picked up the calzone, she checked to see if they got her order right, and what do you know? It was a calzone with ham and ricotta cheese like in the pictures! LMAO. The rude worker who picked up the phone earlier said that they only make it with ham and ricotta cheese, and he denied of receiving any request for pepperoni and mozzarella cheese in the calzone. So you're gonna lie to us and not even apologize? Oh and also, the owner/manager just stood there, and told his employee to just forget us. WOOOOWW. Shame on you guys for reals."}
{"text":"Was in the area. Hungry and saw Grinders pizza. So we tried it. What a great pizza. A sausage,onion and mushroom on a thin crust. It was so good. To bad we live on the other side of town. Really nice people and good service."}
{"text":"Stopped in to grinders Pizza lounge and was pleasantly surprised food was incredible and staff couldn't of been more helpful. Had the Philly steak cheese and enjoyed it very much the pizzas look really good and looking forward to our next visit"}
{"text":"You know the \"secret pizza place\" at the cosmo? This is way better!!! Their white pizza with spinach as recommended by our waiter is beyonddddd amazing and delicious. Super cute interior and really nice staff! I would've never thought to go in if it wasn't for Yelp, but I'm glad I tried it."}
{"text":"Walked in on a Saturday night. The restaurant has nice decor and good beer on tap. I had the wings and they were nice and crispy. The accompanying hot sauce was good!! Hubby had a pepperoni calzone. He liked it, although he thought it was a bit heavy on the ricotta. We shared fries and they along with the ranch were also yummy. Will definitely come back and try the pizza!!"}
{"text":"I had extremely high expectations for this place. I arranged a group of 7 to head here for lunch. Arrived at 12:00pm and there were literally no other customers in the place.  I thought for a second this was going to be good because we are on a time constraint for work. In any case, we all ordered different things and one of the guys in our group waited 50 minutes for a 12\" cheese only pizza. Meanwhile, I ordered two slices with toppings and another guy ordered a 16\" meat lovers pizza and they were delivered before the 12\". Two of my other co-workers ordered gyro's and chicken sandwiches and they both said that the food was fair. My pizza was ok. I liked the fact that they put a lot of toppings on the pizza but it just didn't wow me with the taste. 
The d√©cor of this place is uninviting.   The two guys running this place appeared to be disorganized an inexperienced in running a restaurant. Sad to say that none of us would be returning."}
{"text":"I saw a promotional card that was left at my door for this place and I thought to give it a try, so I ordered some pizza and wings and the flavor was astonishing! So good that I had to try it in person at the actual restaurant. I met the owner and some of the staff and everybody seemed extremely kind and happy which is a trait that I think any restaurant should have. I even went a second time two days after the first time that I went with a friend that can EAT! Lol I was greeted right away upon entry from Gustavo, the owner. And when you can walk into a place and are greeted instantaneously by your first name you feel way more comfortable to sit and eat at a place. Not only the great attitude that was shared with me but of course with my friend as well and the food was out of this world! There are so many great things that I can say about that place, but if you're contemplating whether to go or not to go, do yourself a favor and go sit down and enjoy the hospitality of Grinders!! I know I'll be back there, in fact I'm gonna order some right now"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying- WOW!
Everything is made when you order. Everything. Including the sauce. From real tomatoes. I had the whole Italian sandwich. It was as long as my arm and so good. Husband had a calzone- not swimming in its own grease and amazing crust. Owner/chef guy it totally cool and knows how to cook. Definitely going back. Soon."}
{"text":"Tasty slices, good toppings, and decent beer. Reasonable prices, and I love the ability to customize."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed every single bite the pizza is very good!!!!! And amazing atmosphere and a awesome owner!!!!! I highly recommend this place!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Kudos to Mark for being in touch with their customer base and getting me to try this place again.

I think these guys are headed in the right direction. There was an improvement on the quality of food. The fries came soggy and the chicken parm could've had a bit more sauce, but the flavors were there and the portions were generous.

I do wish they still made the pork sandwich that I originally came to this place for, but I'm eager to try their other offerings. I'll be back."}
{"text":"The staff was extremely nice, which is something you don't find very often here in Vegas. The pizza was delicious and the calamari was great as well. We have plans to return... SOON!!!"}
{"text":"Saw the 4 stars figured give it a try... Place was empty service was good.... Ordered 2 slices of pepperoni... Served me old slices that were dry, no sauce and bottoms burnt... Tried to fold the slice and it broke apart. Then they added cheese on top before the oven to not make it look so dry and it just didn't taste good. Most likely won't be back for slices..."}
{"text":"Meh... Ordered a grinder + fries via Postmates and they were...gross. I mean, I still ate part of 'em because I was super hungry, but I needed to drown 'em in Ranch first. Pretty disappointed after hearing such good things about the place. Maybe pizza would've been a better choice? Meh, oh well... Won't even bother."}
{"text":"I love the calzones here! They're huge! I took one to work and all my coworkers enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Absolutely awful. New management has done a terrible job. Quality has gone down to the point that the cheese has the same texture as plastic. Service is worse. They do not honor coupons. Never coming back."}
{"text":"Wow this place are amazing...
Very clean the food was very good the stuff are very friendly and professionals.. 
I will be back for this place for sure that's my new pizza and wings spot highly recommend.."}
{"text":"Pizza was good, not great. But at least this time, it showed up at a reasonable time. Customer service over the phone was super nice. That's about it. Basically pizza when it's convenient, and when most others are closed."}
{"text":"3 movies deep into our date night, my boyfriend and I decided we were starving at 9:00pm. We couldn't be bothered to leave the house and weren't in the mood of the usual Chinese or pizza delivery so I jumped on Yelp and stumbled onto this place! It had a decent variety and we were starving. We ordered a salad, Mozzarella sticks, and a basket of wing..... for $47. I mean I know delivery is expensive but that should be a crime to charge that much. Whatever, we patiently waited for our food and bit the bullet. When the food came the salad was missing the grilled chicken which is annoying because we were still charged for the grilled chicken. The mozzarella sticks were cold and the cheese inside was hard as if they had just come out of a refrigerator. The wings were breaded but soggy so it felt like you were biting through wet bread to get to the actual meat. My boyfriend said the salad was mediocre but the fact that it was missing the chicken made him feel like he was just eating a bunch of cucumbers. Sad to say that this place is another bad delivery place but the food spoke for itself, definitely pass on ordering from Grinders!"}
{"text":"Great food! Super nice owner! Burgers, wings, gyro and cheesecake have been delicious!"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere, great decor, excellent staff that's willing to make guests happy. Food is awesome! If you're looking for great food, make sure you come check out Grinder's."}
{"text":"We just had the most amazing experience and couldn't have asked for a better pizza! The owner John, was so helpful and informative. His love for good food shines through all the other pizza spots we have been to, and we love pizza lol. The overall atmosphere was undeniably amazing!! Thank you! We definitely need more places like this in California!"}
{"text":"My coworkers were craving pizza and were ready to order from a 3* joint on Yelp, but I decided to see if I could find a better option. UberEats had Grinders, and Yelp said they were 4*, so off we went. $19 for a large pizza with one topping, we went with half pepperoni and half ham. I gotta say, I wasn't impressed. The pizza was fine but it wasn't anything too memorable. Perhaps I would have enjoyed one of their specialty pizzas better, so one day I'll give them another try. But today I have to say it was just an average pizza, sorry guys. :/"}
{"text":"A must try in Vegas.  Two guys from Philly bring the best that the City of Brotherly Love has in terms of pizza and wings.  I've tried them both, and was quite pleased to find authentic taste. In Vegas.  Good selection of craft beers...tried one of those as well.  They feature local artists on their walls with a commitment to have proceeds go to charity.  Thanks John Anthony for your hospitality and conversation."}
{"text":"This pizza place is under new management now and EVERYTHING is halal. So glad to have another halal option in town. Here's the verdict on the food: it is good! We had the chicken garlic pizza and meat lovers. The crust was a little dry but i prefer it that way. Toppings were plentiful as was the taste. We will be gladly going back"}
{"text":"I'm a self professed \"pizza addict\" so you can take it seriously when I say Grinders has become my favorite \"go-to\" spot since the first day they opened their doors. Everything is super fresh, great quality ingredients and the bread is made from scratch in-house daily. It's one of those places that's SO good you eat waaaay past the the point of being full! LITERALLY. 

I typically go with a traditional pepperoni, but if you're looking to live a little TRUST ME  and order the white pizza with spinach, garlic and ricotta. You won't be disappointed, it's ridiculously incredible!! Their pies are so huge I took the rest of the \"personal\" size home and (don't judge) had it for breakfast the next day. STILL DELICIOUS! Today I asked for a \"healthy\" pizza and wasn't disappointed. Perfectly toasty crust, hearty veggies and the most magically proportioned balance of cheese and sauce. I'm a happy girl! 

For the days you're not feeling pizza, you HAVE to try the pork sub with saut√©ed spinach and the cheeseburger sub. Both will make your head spin. Cheat day favorites for sure, especially since they offer beer and wine now. Perfect spot for happy hour!

Outside of the incredible food, the vibe is great too. It's like the Vegas version of Cheers which is pretty cool. You walk in and are greeted by a team that seems genuinely happy to be there, the owners are friendly and welcoming and there are already a ton of regulars who are greeted by name as they walk in.
 
5 stars! Doesn't disappoint!"}
{"text":"Awesome experience!! Italian sytle pizza and wings were off the hook!! and the owner Moris was very welcoming!! Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Ordered a regular size supreme for pickup. Was bland small and expensive. Almost $20.00"}
{"text":"Great place!
Love the previous owner and the present owner. Hospitality, greeting, pizza and deserts is five star. My child loves this place"}
{"text":"The reason I only gave two stars is because it is under new management. I found Grinders a little over a year ago and absolutely loved this place. Always got the cheesesteak sub and the guys always knew how to make it great. Today I went in and ordered my usual. No more fresh baked rolls, not even a steak roll. Just small store bought sandwich rolls. I was also told next time they would have to charge me for the lettuce, tomato and onion because it wasn't a regular cheesesteak! The sandwich wasn't that good. Obviously the guy that tried to make it probably never made a cheesesteak in his life. I asked where John the owner was and they told me he owned the place, but they were managing it now. I certainly will not be returning. They've lost my business. I'm pretty sure the new guys will run the business into the ground. If you're looking for a great East coast cheesesteak, this was the place, but not anymore."}
{"text":"Very clean establishment, great friendly service and the Cheese Steak sandwich was a perfect snack for a busy day!"}
{"text":"I was visiting in vegas, looked for a good pizza and got this place by accident, the service was amazing and the taste was delicious.
Was so happy to find this place and definitely will come back for sure. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Came here to try something new. Everyone there was very friendly. It's one of those mom and pop kinda places. Which is always nice to have in the neighborhood. Makes you feel comfortable and welcomed. 

The wings are really good. Sometimes its hard to find good wings. My only complaint was the wing sauce. It had a very weird after taste. I personally just like the typical wing sauce. Nothing fancy just wing sauce. But the actual wings were yummy. Also the mozzarella sticks were good. Next time I plan to try the pizza. I wasn't in the mood for pizza that day but when I am I will try it from this place. I would have given 5 stars but that wing sauce kinda disappointed me. Good wing sauce whether it be hot, mild or medium should always be good on wings."}
{"text":"I ordered the thin crust pizza and it was delicious ! Not too much oil and the crust was on point ! 
Definitely gonna come back again ."}
{"text":"They have new owners now the food isn't as good as it was. The pizza don't seem to be done. There's no taste at all. I'm not sure what they are doing with the recipe but they need to ask the old owners."}
{"text":"First time coming here we had a group of 9 plus one toddler and baby. Plenty of room for everyone and definitely plenty of yummy food! The pizza is amazing and I definitely know this won't be my last time visiting."}
{"text":"This place has the best pizza ever . Also the customer service is amazing.  I highly recommend eating ."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza thin crust, good sauce and GREAT service. Great service, I will be back to try more menu items. Did I mention how great the service was? A new fan here! Go see for yourself!"}
{"text":"Came here with my family. Ordered a meatball pizza and wings. Everything was good and the meat balls were extra yummy. The guys working were nice.  Ill be coming back"}
{"text":"I came with my mom and we ordered 2 cheesesteak and a pizza and it was amazing the best cheesesteak I ever had and the pizza was cooked well.
I recommend to everyone to go and try it."}
{"text":"Horrible. Thought we'd try something new and saw this place. I ordered an Italian sub, girlfriend got a calzone and roommate a cheesesteak.  Yes, they make their own sub rolls. But that's not necessarily a good thing. Certain spots on the roll were cracker thin and crunchy, not like the rolls are supposed to be. My Italian sub is supposed to be a cold sub, not a hot sub. On top of the roll already being hot, after the cheese was placed too, the \"cook\" placed it in the pizza oven to melt....again the sub should be cold!  Cheesesteak was cooked in a frying pan, not sure if they even had a flat top to cook on. Fries were not good at all. The calzone was not too bad, however pineapples looked like they were approaching the end of their freshness. Ketchup bottle was on counter, empty. They knew this because we were given packets with our order. Not once were we asked how things were or checked on. \"Cook\" and other employee kept speaking in their foreign language to each other which I find very unprofessional especially right in front of us when we are the only customers in the store. Stay away!"}
{"text":"this is now my favorite pizzeria!
love the bread (thin crust) fresh cheese and actual pepperoni...thank you!"}
{"text":"If I can give Grinder's a 10 star rating I would! This has got to be one of the best places I have ever stopped to grab a bite to eat. The food is always amazing (there's more than pizza on the menu) and the guys here are the real reason I keep coming back. Very personable, and always greet everyone who walks in and leaves. I am definitely coming back. At least 3 times a week, since it's conveniently located next to my work."}
{"text":"1st time we ordered it was amazing! But that's not usually a guarantee it'll be good again...After several bad \"2nd experiences\" , we were on the fence about what to expect but honestly - the crust is badass! The wings- crispy as hell! & the calamari was just MWAH!! 
Delivery was super quick & the staff is real friendly  do yourself a favor & 
ORDER THIS PLACE UP NOW!!!"}
{"text":"Updated review: the pizza is great again - now I just pick it up instead of waiting for delivery. Thanks guys"}
{"text":"Great service food is amazing can't ask for more this reminds me of back in LA pizza I will definitely be back and will be recommending this to my friends and guest at my job!"}
{"text":"Absolutely awful. The new owners have done a terrible job!! Quality is down and prices are up. Never going back."}
{"text":"I read about this place several months back on Vegas Chatter.  My Eureka moment, was, \"Wow this place is right down the road!\" Russell and Rainbow.  What a gem this has turned out to be.  Rick and John are the proprietors and like other posts are in fact from Philly.  They have taken this transient strip mall and made it a stopping point for your Spring Valley travels.  (The Euro deli a few doors down is great too).

More impressive is they have made it a very not Vegas feel.  Both men and staff, shout out to Modest, are very pleasant and give that back home pizzeria, where you can take the family for a sit down dinner.  It can also double as the after school hang out for the local high school as a slice of pizza is very reasonable.  

I was in there last night and come to have found out they have grown their taps from 2 to 6.  Don't forget to check out the chalk board for their promo bottle for $3 it can be a great value.  For all you other yeast folks in the form of bread not beer, they make their own dough and gives the bread for the sandwiches and the pizzas that added texture that you seek from places back in the Midwest or East coast.  John was a bit of mad scientist and explained to me one night how the played with the mineral levels to get the water they way they needed it to make it work,  Something Capriottis used to do, but no longer(spoiler).

Check it out!"}
{"text":"this place is awesome. modest is a spectacular server. she has a pleasant, welcoming personality which goes great along with the entire atmosphere. it feels like ur hanging out at a friends house! everybody is super informed when it comes to the menu and all the items they carry.  the owners are from the east coast so you know the food is made with love! the philly was my favorite . also the pizza is super tasty too. thx again modest u are fantastic."}
{"text":"My bf loves pizza, so we seem to try every pizza place nearby. He ordered pepperoni pizza with spinach which was delish combination. We were a bit sad coz they tapped out of Alaskan IPA. Would've been a perfect dinner. Lol. 
Anyways, they serve think crust pizza. I found it greasy which I thought was normal for pizzas. Overall, I will definitely come back with bf here."}
{"text":"Lemme tell ya something...  Grinders is freaking fantastic, and exactly the kind of local entrepreneurial eatery that our city needs more of, as boring/crappy/corporate chain after chain invades Las Vegas.  I drive past every one of those soulless merchants of prison food to chow down with the good people at Grinders!  This is authentic, tasty, and inexpensive food from some dudes that grew up in the Philly area and know their stuff.  And by the way, if you are giving a 1-star review to a place that averages 4 and 1/2 stars based on well over 100 reviews, there is a very good chance that you are an idiot, a hater, or both!  Now, on to some highlights:

(1) yes, the name of the place says \"Pizza Lounge\", and the pizza is very good (although as with any pizza place, it's always best to order a fresh pie - they make a great 6-slice personal size - than the slices sitting under the heat lamp), but look closely at the first word in their name...  \"Grinders\"!  What does that mean?  That, my friend, is a sandwich (like a sub) that is heated in the oven, and comes out toasted with melted cheese.  Mmm, mmm, good!  I personally recommend the Italian, the pork (with spinach saut√©ed in garlic), the meatball (when available), and of course, the cheesesteak (try it hoagie style with lettuce, tomato, & mayo).  And to the genius who complained in his review that the sandwiches are $11 (the same food connoisseur who suggests that you go to a corporate chain instead), that is for a \"whole\" sandwich, which is beyond \"mega\" and way too much food for most of us reasonably-sized people.  All you need in this world is a half-sandwich (comes with fries), and maybe a tasty little half salad beforehand.  Do the right thing here.

(2) this place takes it craft beer seriously, and is one of the few restaurants in this part of town which devotes 4 of their 6 tap handles to a changing array of craft beers from great breweries such as Ninkasi, Alaskan, Founders, Joseph James, and others.  Plus, they usually have a couple of good craft beers in bottles in the back if you ask nicely.  There may even be a secret underworld craft beer society growing here, but I am sworn to secrecy!

(3) the game day football specials here are outrageous.  If I remember correctly, we are talking about $5 personal pizzas (eating a whole one will more than fill you up), and 1/2 price draft beers.  You don't even need to care about the football game that's on the TV, just come in and have a great meal & a craft beer for cheap!

(4) the folks who run Grinders are a really great group.  This is their business, and they are totally immersed in it, and will do anything to make sure their customers are happy.  Those couple of ridiculous bad reviews (I especially like the one from the Elite Yelper who basically said that the service & all the food was very good except for the calamari, but still gave them only 2 stars, and complained that $45 was too much for the mega-feast of large pizza, wings, calamari, etc. that they ordered - time to go back to Chuck-E-Cheese, cheapskate!) really do upset and affect them, and they work tirelessly to make improvements, though I suppose you can't please everyone.  The sheer amount of \"regulars\" that I see in here is proof that if you come in a few times, try a few different things on the menu, and chat up some of the friendly staff, there is a good chance that you will become a Grinder yourself!

Peace out, and if you see me there, maybe I'll buy you a pint of craft beer!"}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza and dessert - would have loved to add to the rave reviews about how great the food is, but unfortunately it never arrived. Good news - Yelp Eat24 refunded my money. However, now going to bed hungry."}
{"text":"Went here one day for lunch to try it out. Service was great, but I wish I could say the same regarding the food. I bought 2 slices of pizza, one was an anchovies, mushroom and the other was pepperoni. I had to eat both slices of pizza with a fork and knife, because they were collapsing when picked up as the bread was extremely thin. Finally, maybe it's just personal preference as I usually enjoy pizza with gooey cheese, but the cheese on the pizza slices I had were actually kinda lumpy and so I ended up leaving a lot of it on my plate."}
{"text":"Not sure how this place ended up with a 4.5 star review?! Took 10 minutes just to get our drinks- from the time we were finally greeted- 15 minutes from the time we sat down. (Drinks were flat when they finally came out.) While we were waiting, other customers left because they weren't even greeted- until they were walking out the door. The cook/cashier/server was seriously overwhelmed. The music was annoying and loud, as were the TVs. One monitor was blasting kids cartoons, the other was set to a Spanish channel. Pizza finally came 35 minutes after we sat down- and we were the only ones in the place. The pizza was just ok, if I were rating the pizza alone I'd score it a 3 out of 5. Not worth the wait. -If you need to kill time and feel like having some average quality pizza then this is the place!"}
{"text":"Went to Vegas for Memorial Day weekend and stop by for a pizza.Just what we needed after a long trip.The owner of the restaurant made for us the best pizza we have had in a very long time.The service was great and very friendly employees. Definitely will recommend it."}
{"text":"Amazing NY style pizza, not too oily. Huge meaty wings with a tasty buffalo sauce. To top it off - flavorful craft beer of the day for only $3 a bottle...SOLD.

My girlfriend and I were lucky to find this place after a terrible experience at Scooters Pub down the road (near-1hr wait for food). We'll be back to Grinders for more - already added it to our personal list of Vegas' best.

Oh - and super friendly staff! No discernible drop in service despite a group of 20 high school kids that came in."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here only because of a Groupon. We loved EVERYTHING about this hole in the wall. The staff is beyond friendly, the calamari appetizer was amazing, the pizza could not have been better, and they had a great selection of beer and wine.
Our server, Modest, made us feel welcomed and special. She was extremely easy to chat with and engaged us in a greatly enjoyable conversation.  Before we even finished our meal my wife and I made the decision that this place was going to be part of our Dinning Out rotation. We greatly look forward to going back as soon as possible."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza, pretty much the only real pizza delivery option in this area. And it's great quality. Really fresh dough. They have amazing customer service as well! They really go above and beyond to insure that every customer feels they got value for their money. I've been ordering from here for years and still recommend them to everyone."}
{"text":"Amazing service!! And fast! Pizza was delicious! Had the chicken wings with sauce on the side! And the chicken and steak Philly, great sandwiches!!!"}
{"text":"I have to say I found Grinders on yelp and I tried it because of the great reviews and all I have to say is they were right:-). The food was awesome the staff was so friendly I felt like I was a regular the way they all conversed with me I will be back I got a pizza and the cheeseburger sub incredible my friends loved it too.  Thx you grinders see u soon.  Steve from Southwest Airlines"}
{"text":"Super fresh and delicious chicken wings! The marinara sauce that goes with breadsticks is amazing. Will recommend!"}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly, but the food wasn't good. We all left with stomach aches that soon followed."}
{"text":"They said 25 mins, I called after 45 mins 5 times til someone answered and said 15 more mins which it showed up after an hour of placing the order. When the delivery guy came he looked like he was out of it. The pizza was the worst I ever had from there. Idk what happened to their service and pizza. Really sad."}
{"text":"Amazing and fast service! I found this place on the Entertainment book and it was a great decision! Will definatly come back. Thank you"}
{"text":"Horrible service!! Refused to honor a coupon that had an expiration date of 8/31/2018. Says he is a new manager and doesn't have to honor any coupons. This is not the way to run a business. This was horrible service and I'm guessing this place will be out of business very soon. Although we didn't eat there due to his refusal to assist us, the place appeared to be dirty and not in good shape. I would NOT recommend patronizing this place at all."}
{"text":"Brought my grilfriend here and got a large Hawaiian pizza courtesy of letting them know that I was coming in for a date night.
The staff was awesome and we got a chance to banter back and forth while we waited for our fresh pizza.
We got an incredible pizza with a crispy crust and aide that's out of this world. If you get a chance , stop by here and grab some pizza !!"}
{"text":"Outstanding place.  Clean, great food, and great service.  You can tell the owner is passionate about his business."}
{"text":"Had to get my Grinders pizza fix this afternoon.  Shouldn't have held off on my craving for so long!  (Ok, it's only been a couple weeks).  Carried out my favorite pizza so I resisted having one of the many beers on tap.  Definitely will have to bring the hubby back for his favorite pork sandwich and calamari.  Always great to see the friendly owners.  Place looks great and they've added Golden Tee to go with our sports/TV viewing pleasure.  See you next date night Grinders Pizza Lounge!!"}
{"text":"Best Bomb-Ass large cheese pizza in Vegas! this place is amazing: easy to find, plenty of parking, fast service, fantastic food, friendly staff, clean bathrooms, and most importantly, they make the classic NY style cheese pizza. you know the kind : not to thick , edges are crispy , fresh cheese, and folded over .. damn it, now i have to rush before they close at 10pm to get one :-)"}
{"text":"It's my second time here at Grinders pizza. Owners Kemal and Mustafa are super cool and they let me try different pizzas today. I have to admit that I m in love with \" Kamal's Buffalo Hot Chicken\" one. Great place and will keep coming."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with my son, husband, brother in law & family friend. Great food! Great environment, I forgot the mans name that had greeted us and checked on us the entire time but he was so sweet & so friendly. We ordered burgers & wings , the wings were absolutely amazing! & They were huge! We watched them make the pizza by hand and it was so fresh & it looked and smelled delicious! Will definitely have to try the next time we come by :) 

UPDATE : my family & I came back to try the pizza & it was the BEST pizza we've ever tried! They made it all handmade & it was so much fun watching how they do it! I came back again the next day to pick up another for my coworkers :)"}
{"text":"Very nice place good service two young guys trying to advance I like it I enjoyed the food and the company thank you for the dessert thank you guys"}
{"text":"Came here with 2 co workers on our lunch break. The owner was friendly and I had a good vibe about this place and thought we would get taken care of but once he left with his family we were basically treated poorly by the people inside. We only had 30 minutes and for 3 sandwiches it took them 45 minutes to make. They guy who took our order seemed to be in another world/out of it. He was slow at taking orders and his customer service skills sucked. We said we needed it to go and ignored us while continuing to put it on the plate. I really hate complaining about places but I felt like I needed to be honest. I was even willing to overlook all of that until we realized that one sandwich wasnt even what my friend ordered, one of us didnt want fries and got it anyways, and for the amount of money we spent we could have gotten much better food and service elsewhere. We even ordered what they recommended which was the Philly. Literally the worst one Ive had in Vegas. I was going to give this place initially 3 stars just because I knew the owner in the past as we hung around the same places together and knew mutual people but once it got to the point where it affected our food and time for lunch, there was no fixing it. Also I was told by my co worker that when he tried to go back and give them another chance, which was my suggestions because i was hoping that it would be a better experience to write a positive review - that he had to go order food else where because there was a woman dealing with a baby and then without washing her hands started touching and doing things in the kitchen/behind the counter."}
{"text":"Tried this based on reviews and the fact that it's right by our house. The place has a cool vibe. Nice employees. Ordered a pizza and a salad. Pizza was just average, nothing special.  Crust tasted like it was once frozen (not fresh). The salad was basic. Over all, not too bad. No huge reason to go back."}
{"text":"Today was the second time for me and the Hubby. We ordered, calamari, arugula salad, and a Stromboli. Everything was fresh, delicious and came out quickly. The staff was super friendly and gave great customer service. Can't wait to try out the rest of the awesome looking things on the menu!"}
{"text":"In the same shopping center at my new barbershop (shout out to Hats Off), another mom and pop style pizza joint that's also competent can be found. (Can I just say how happy I am that it's so much easier to find decent non-chain pizza in this town these days?)

As stated other reviews, the owners happen to be from Philly, which is already a good sign in of itself. For the weary (like me) they offer a $5.99 deal of two pizza slices and a drink. I ordered one slice of cheese and one slice of sausage. And they weren't bad at all! Non-greasy, thick but not too thick, and quality ingredients.

The ambiance was a little bit too mancave-ish for my taste, but the decent food and service allowed me to grin and bear it. 

The Final Verdict:

Pros:
Yet another decent pizza shop in Vegas.
Great lunch special. 
Friendly service

Cons:
Ambiance has too many shots of testosterone.

Return Factor: 7/10."}
{"text":"This is a great little family spot. Great food and great service. My whole crew ordered subs and enjoyed them very much. The half size is very filling - everything was made fresh with yummy ingredients. The wait for everything to be prepared was very worth it for how delicious everything tastes. The zeppoles are a must!!"}
{"text":"Went here for my wife's coworker reunion. Great service. Had the buffalo chicken pizza  right amount of everything. And the cheese bread sticks soooo cheesy.!! Chicken wings are delicious and so fresh. Service was friendly. A must try!! Will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"What great customer service.  The food was hot and fresh. Love the food had the pizza, wings,  calzone.  I will go back again it was a great experience."}
{"text":"Food is amazing! Cooked to perfection. Ahmad, the cook is very friendly. Will def be coming back. Had the calzone. Big for the small price. Meatballs made in-house. I'm a fan! Family had the pepperoni pizza and really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service, Amazing wings and fries ! The seasoned fries taste amazing! Perfectly sauced wings ! I'm glad I decided to stop in here and a very welcoming restaurant ! You've gained a returning customer ! 

Thank you!"}
{"text":"Went for pizza today with some friends. Four of us ordered pizza. The pizza was cut for 3 people. I was served the old pizza which had been sitting up front for a while (all day ?) I asked why my food looked funny. I couldnt eat it it was so disgusting! They made a new whole pizza - I told them to forget it - everyone else was already done eating. I still got charged. They should have done the right thing to begin with. A terrible experience and will never go there again. 90 minutes to get 2 slices of fresh pizza #badfood #vegas #unfollow"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch and found the place empty. $10.95 and up for average sandwiches. Minimal amount of fries for the price. Almost anywhere else is better than this place. Very blah, boring atmosphere. The cook was barely that. Go to Capriottis or Jimmy Johns, even Firehouse subs blows this place away!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were in a pizza craving and happened to spot Pizza Lounge while passing by. Gave it a shot and we were so very happy we did. Got a half and half large pizza (she likes mushrooms and I love me my pepperoni) and some mozzarella sticks to tie us over. Mozzarella sticks were pretty much what one expects, but when that pizza came out it looked fantastic. After my first bite I was already impressed and extremely satisfied. Pizza was so delicious and flavorful. It was gone within 10 minutes. The service was fast, friendly, and helpful. I'd definitely try them again if I was in that area, OR they do Uber Eats, Eat24, Amazon Restaurants for delivery for convenience :)"}
{"text":"Hadn't been for about a year, long story short, wasn't comfortable in the parking lot.  But that has all changed now!  And SO GLAD we went back.  Had a craving for the cheesesteak, you can't find anything else like it here in Vegas.  Being from the Philly area, I know this for a fact.  Anyway, there are new owners now and they are awesome!  They are friendly and the food is even better than before (if that is even possible)...  Portions are very (very) generous.  Now this is back in the lunch rotation, so glad we went back!"}
{"text":"ordered delivery and just gave up waiting for it. Waited for almost 2 hours and it still hasnt showed up when i just ordered 2 salads and a garlic bread. they even told me 30min ago the driver is on the way. How long does it take to make a salad? dont even want to try going to the actual restaurant and wait for a pizza lol probably will be eating their napkin from starvation."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza! Grinders dough is the best, you can taste the love that goes into making their pies. Hand-tossed yumminess."}
{"text":"I bought a Groupon that included a cheese pizza, an appetizer and a bottle of the house wine. 

I the appetizer was calamari. It was perfectly crisp and the marinara dipping sauce was flavorful. 

The cheese pizza was on a thin crust and it was garlicky (vampires beware) and delicious. :) 

The restaurant is small. It has maybe about 10 tables. It's cozy. The tables were covered with white table cloths which I thought was awesome. Every-so-often somebody would walk pass and ask us if we were doing okay or if we needed anything. 

And the bathroom was very clean. I have nothing negative to say about this restaurant. Keep up the great service."}
{"text":"Very friendly and great food!  Hard combo to find in Vegas.  Had the calamari and the chicken salad sandwich and both were very, very good!  I can't wait to try the pizza which I've heard is amazing as well....  Fast delivery as well"}
{"text":"Being all about service, I felt I received friendly, attentive service. Atmosphere is laid back & pleasant. You can hear yourself talk but it's not a boring vibe. Had a fresh, crisp Caesar's salad & the pizza was tasty. Heard the beer on tap quite good as well. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"The experience was great from the moment we walked in the door till we left. The owner John was super nice and took the time to explain the menu and some of the favorites. They have some unique bottle and draft beers if you are looking for a more eclectic selection of drinks. 

The decor was very cool with a very artsy vibe. He explained that every 90 days they feature a local artist and they display all of their work, with a tie to a charity. Love that! 

Food was served promptly, everything was delicious, with the breads made in house daily. Husband LOVED the pork sandwich, my cheesesteak was great and usually the bread falls apart but since they make their own bread it was not only tasty but held up well with the grease from the sandwich. Then the desert came.. Tried both the cannoli and the zeppolis, and the zeppolis were amazing! Definitely would recommend."}
