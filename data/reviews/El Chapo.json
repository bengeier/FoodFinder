{"text":"Amazing tacos!

I tried 3 tacos: fish, shrimp, and braised beef 

The Tacos range from $5.25 - 5.95. I would say, compared to other taco joints like Grand Electric; the taco fillings are much muuucch more generous here.

Each taco has it's own set of toppings, sauces etc. Each one is a different world. The shrimp was creamy and mild yet bursting with mexican spices. The fish with the cornmeal batter was crispy, somewhat nutty and paired with a roasted beat sauce. The braised beef- like a taco burger, a fist full of beef braised in banana leaves, extremely aromatic and juicy.

This isn't your run of the mill taco joint. It's a bit of a adventure. If you're a fan of tacos I highly recommend visiting because you won't find tacos quite like this anywhere else."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a snack, had the shrimp taco.  About 4 or 5 shrimps, probably the 26/30 extra large size, definitely juicy and not overcooked, with sauce, greens and cheese on 2 corn tortillas.  Unlike another reviewer's my corn tortillas held together just fine despite it being a fairly saucy taco - I did eat it as soon as it was ready though so no time for sauce to soak through.  Tortillas were very fresh.  

Taste was good but not knock out of the park, flavour profile not all that unique.  At over $7 with tax & tip it is steep for one taco but the quality and quantity of ingredients help justify the economics, although by no means would this joint ever be known for value.  Staff was very nice. 
 While not in a hurry, will definitely be back, interested in trying the other tacos.  

Overall rating of this visit = 3.5 stars, hopefully next visit will raise it higher."}
{"text":"This place was quite overpriced. The meat tacos had a good portion but the fish tacos were very bad, tasted like it was frozen but they added a ton of oil to mask that. Chips and guac were OK, you can find that anywhere in Toronto."}
{"text":"This is a cute place! Great branding and it's in a nice spot to grab lunch or after dinner tacos. 

I had the barbacoa and fish tacos. The barbacoa was DELICIOUS, the meat was tender and incredibly flavorful, and the fish taco was also fantastic, very crisp and delicious. Each taco comes with two corn tortillas which taste great but have TERRIBLE structural integrity - they pretty much disintegrated when I tried to pick it up because of the juices from the barbacoa. 

For drinks they they the usual bevy of canned classics and water, and of course a nice selection of jarritos! (FYI they have a bottle opener on the shelf above the cooler by the register to open them). They were also kind enough to give my dining companion and I two free churros each (I think because it was near closing? It was awesome though) which are super delightful.

It's not exactly cheap, two tacos and a jarrito cost me $13.50 (the tacos are all in the $5 range) but if you're in the mood to try something new in the area I would recommend it! 

There's also a coffee shop on the other side of the restaurant which we didn't try, but it looked great and we are eager to give it a whirl soon."}
{"text":"Fine but not enough to get me to go back.  Fish in the fish taco wasn't particularly warm.  Veggie taco was decent. Side of beans was fine.  Side or rice was quite good - not your normal leaden Mexican rice. 

But at $20 for two tacos, rice, beans and a coke this place is a bit pricy for what you get.  

Not a bad lunch but not enough to get me to go back"}
