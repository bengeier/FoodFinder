{"text":"This restaurant has now become the worst Thai restaurant in Toronto. AVOID THIS PLACE. 
I ordered the cashew chicken lunch combo with soup, salad and spring roll. The hot and sour soup was tasteless, it was served at room temperature and was not spicy or sour. The salad was made from wimpy lettuce and and a half slice of soggy tomato. The spring roll was greasy and lacked any filling. The spring roll sauce was watered down and had no flavor or taste. Just when I thought it could not get any worse, I tried the entree. In the cashew chicken all I could taste was the abundence of soy sauce. This is the only dish I have ever returned after the first bite. The waitress charged for all items even complaining about the horrible food. There are so many other good Thai restaurants in the area. If I could I would give this Zero stars."}
{"text":"Great for lunch, cheap but great quality and portions. Don't order a lunch special unless you want the extras, its cheaper a la carte."}
{"text":"I am usually generous with my rating, but this place did not meet my low standards. My \"freshly cooked\" pad thai contained frozen tofu. The noodle was not even fully cooked.

I will never return to this place."}
{"text":"Service was excellent. Food was fresh and tasted great. Price was extremely reasonable. I had the salmon sushi combo."}
{"text":"I don't know why everyone has been calling this place so simple, maybe I am an exception, but whenever I have been they have given me great service, and extremely fresh food which is not over salted for a change in fast food places! That does not mean that it tastes under seasoned but rather that i don't find myself waking up gasping in the middle of the night desperate for water!

Anyways as I said very fresh, and great tasting. My orders are always accompanied by a lovely lime and a bundle of Thai basil which is oh so good. I have heard some people complain about the lack of meat, however I have never had this problem, and always get a lot.

My suggested order:

Red Curry Chicken:
In my opinion their best curry, it is sweet but also tangy and is not too heavy. A nice balance of flavours, chicken is the best option for this curry

Pad Thai:
Nicely cooked rice noodles with firm but cooked veggies, and a lovely but not overpowering tamarind sauce. Comes with a fresh lime to squeeze over, and some perfectly toasted peanuts, and thin slices of carrots.

Rainbow Chicken:
A nice blend of chicken and veggies with a nice spicy sauce, lighter than a curry, and comes with eggplant. Very tasty.

I don't like my food particularly spicy and find their option of Spicy to be just the right tang. I don't admit to be a connoisseur but it tastes authentic and fresh and I enjoy going there. 

Oh an since the prices are so great I can usually get a lot of food, great portion sizes too, better than the two closest alternatives which are Thai One On and Spring Rolls which I find more expensive and inferior."}
{"text":"Their food is good but slow service when it was not busy. I asked for a soup and the just left the bowls there. I'm assuming you have to serve yourself when the soup comes. I wish they train their staff so we know when to expect our food and not keep looking at our watches."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. Fresh fresh ingredients and great service. I will make a plan to eat here at least twice a week."}
{"text":"Restaurant is around the corner from the hotel we are staying at. I had a chicken curry dish that was very good. My wife had basil chicken which she also liked. Other than the slow service, it was an enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"I think this is probably the cheapest thai in the Yonge & Dundas area - fast service but as noted by previous reviewers spicy is not really spicy.  My friend ordered mango rice with chicken - small slivers of chicken (looked like thin pieces of bulgogi) and I had the pad thai.  

Restaurant was not very busy on a Thursday night - there was only one other table of 2 when I went."}
{"text":"Went here last week for dinner. 
The place was pretty decent and the service was good. Both my husband and I are vegetarians, so the waitress patiently pointed out to us if the dish had any fish sauce in it. Ordered basil noodles and golden curry. Both were really good (liked the noodles better, it was very flavourful). The service was quick. We would definitely go there again, when we are in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"It just okay.
The prices were great. Great fast serves.
We had beef and chicken dishes not a lot meat on the plate.
Also had a thai soup also okay.
I would not go back."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's usually quiet, but the service is great and food is always fresh! 

This isn't the place for authentic thai food, but it is always consistent and delicious! 
I recommend this place for friends or if you are just looking for a quick and healthy meal that is off the beaten track of the downtown core."}
{"text":"The fried rice is spicy and tasty. Spring rolls are good and crisp. Lunch special is with reasonable price, and the service is good."}
{"text":"Got the red curry with chicken and rice. It was good but not authentic Thai food. I would still come back though for a quick bite if I'm in the area but wouldn't purposely make the trip downtown for it"}
{"text":"An average lunch place for the area. The food is decent, standard, fast food thai. The prices are between $7-11 for a main dish.  The spice scale here is right on par with mine, meaning \"Spicy\" is actually spicy.  When I eat out, I usually order one spice level higher than I actually want, so here I ordered \"Spicy\" because I wanted \"Medium\", and as it turned out, my tongue was burning.  If you're looking for a different dish than the usual pad thai or curry, try the tom yum noodle soup, which is comprised of exactly what it sounds like - tom yum soup with noodles in it."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner with my teenage son. They have a pretty sweet dinner deal for 13.50 per person that includes a soup, dumplings, salad and a main dish. I chose vegetarian options while my son chose chicken. We upgraded our simple lettuce salad to a mango salad by paying $2 per person. Loved the food and the friendly service. Will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"I have been here countless times and have not once had a bad experience! The food is always fresh the flavours are beyond perfect and the staff are always friendly. 
My favourite is the Red Curry Chicken or the Beef pad Thai! DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"Came here on a sat night around 7pm, the restaurant wasn't too busy but surprised to see only one waiter serving the entire restaurant! Ordered the chicken red curry rice dinner combo, and it took extremely long time for the dish to come out ( longer then 1 hour!) Had to put more $ in the parking meter due to the long delay for the food to come out... not the most pleasant experience especially when we are also really hungry and had to wait for more then an hour for our food to arrive.  Red curry taste is blend and mediocre.  Watery and somewhat lack of flavors that it should have.  Definitely not worth the 1 hour+ wait for the food!  I could get better curry tastw at mall foodcourts without the 1Hr+ wait!! Will not come back again."}
{"text":"It's been almost a year since my last visit to this place and it was much better this time around.  The chicken coconut soup was nicely flavoured and the pad sew had good amount of smokiness."}
{"text":"This place is very underrated. By no means I think the food is very authentic but their food is amazing. If you come here you have to try their Thai Basil Fried Rice, Panang Curry or Bangkok Glass Noodle. Will always come here as long as the business stays opened."}
{"text":"This place looks a bit shabby compared to the other more popular restaurants along Dundas but I'd consider coming back here for a quick bite. 

Early 5PM dinner, place was basically empty. It's a rather big space with large tables. Food came out fast and hot. 
Chicken pad thai was nicely plated and quite a large portion. I liked the peanuts on top, there was a good amount of chicken and what I appreciated most was that I could smell the tamarind.
Tastewise, I liked it, it didn't taste like ketchup sauce you get at other Thai restaurants which is far from authethic. Getting a noodle/rice dish will set you back around 12-13 dollars after tax and tip."}
{"text":"Ended up at this \"Evergreen\" place as I felt like Thai Food and since it was Sunday I didn't have much of choice in that area for thai food (hint hint Sukho Thai is closed on Sundays) The place nothing special and is geared towards a quick meal. I had the fish in spicy sauce with a spice level of 2 chilies (i wish I had ordered 4 chili) The service was prompt and on a hot day like today I could use all the hydration I could get. Food came in fast as well. Simple Plain presentation. It wasn't as spicy as I would have liked it to be. Portion was OK. certainly not the best choice of Thai in area (Read somehow if you can't make it to Sukho Thai) I would try this place out for a quick Meal.
Two and Half Stars."}
{"text":"Ehhh. Pretty standard fast thai food. Had the Panang Curry, was sort of craving something that was spicy enough that it would clean out my sinuses, but alas Evergreen did not pull through.

Probably won't go back. But cheap ($7 curry plus tip), fast service and really close to the bus station where I find myself heading every now and then. Also, they have some ambitious ivy growing on strings going on in there, which makes me envious."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE

It's the only place I will eat thai food in Ontario. 

Great prices, awesome veggie selection, super tasty, and quick service."}
{"text":"Ordered bronze sushi combo for $11. Fast and friendly service, restaurant was clean and empty at 6pm. 

Large pieces of fish, which is great, but before even opening my to go box there was a very strong fishy smell! Not very fresh-- the salmon and tuna were dull, not bright and colourful. Cheap, but sub par quality."}
{"text":"Stopped by here after the Cavalcade of Lights as we were craving some Thai food! 

I ordered the red curry and a couple vegetable spring rolls. The food took a while to come out - the curry came out before the apps. I had to ask them about the rolls as I thought they forgot, and then they brought it to me. 

I took a bite in, and really did not like the taste of the spring rolls. After closer inspection - it was a shrimp roll. I'm severely allergic to shrimp, so I started to freak out a bit. I complained to them and they got to work on the vege rolls like I asked for. 15 minutes late, I had to ask them again on here the rolls were and they finally brought it out. 

Overall, it was poor service, but the food wasn't bad (the curry was delicious, and the spring rolls were average). However, based on the poor service and big mistake on my order, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Have you ever been in the Yonge-Dundas-University area when a sudden and evil craving for copious amounts of greasy thai noodles comes on? I know the feeling. The options in the area aren't amazing, but trust me and stick to Evergreen over the others (e.g. Thai One On, Spring Rolls, Thai Express).  This is really basic stuff- it doesn't pretend to be \"classy\" (e.g. the sooo mediocre and overpriced Spring Rolls) and you are left full in terms of your stomach and wallet."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch, waited 45 minutes for the food to come. Food was mediocre, noodle dish size was small. Horrible service from the server. Very rude. The bill took another 30 mins to come."}
{"text":"Came here cause we had a large group and was looking for this food.

There are two people that take orders and bring out the food. The restaurant is split into two sections, so getting service may be difficult. It also takes awhile for them to get back to you. 

This place can also take a really long time to get your food out. We had a table of 10 and the last dish arrived almost 20 minutes after the first dish arrived. You might have better luck if you just all order the same thing.

The food is decent. Portions are pretty good and the prices are comparable to other thai restaurants like Salad king or Thai on Yonge, both of which are less than 5 minutes walk away.

If you're with a small group it's not too bad."}
{"text":"As I write this, this restaurant sits at an average rating of 3 and a half stars and that is exactly right.  The ambience is that of a typical sushi restaurant - decent enough to sit down in but not somewhere you'd want to stay for very long. I ordered the daily special, a red Thai curry combo, which was a pretty good deal at $11.50 with a spring roll, soup and salad. It was really decent - not the best I've ever had - but a good portion and pretty tasty. This doesn't rank among the best Thai restaurants in the city, but is somewhere I'd consider going to again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"This place is not bad. I've been here 2-3 times over the years. I've had pad thai and some curries here. The curries are good. For pad thai, it might just be a personal preference but I like Salad Kind's more. I'm also pretty convinec that SK's portions are slightly larger.

It bothers me a little when a place is not authentic. I'm open to the idea that the staff don't need to be Thai to serve authentic Thai food, but when you also serve sushi in a Thai restaurant, I start to question the authenticity. The decor is also more run-down compared to Salad King. This is very typical of Asian owners who focus more on being practical. 

The prices don't really induce me to come here over Salad King. Salad King is about 5 mins walk away. Salad King also has a stamp card system and free spring roll coupons can be obtained easily from my friend. There isn't enough reason for me to come back to Evergreen. The only exception is if I really want Thai food and really need a sit-in restaurant and Salad King is full."}
{"text":"Although this is no by no means the best Thai food in town, the food is pretty good and the service is wonderful. Packed during lunch time, it can be difficult to find a seat. Most, if not all of the items on the menu are under $10 and you can order food on a spice scale - spicy to crazy spicy! The latter is how I like it! 

The daily special is only $10 and comes with a veggie spring roll, veggie soup, green salad, and your choice of one of the following: shrimp or chicken glass noodles, mango chicken or cashew beef. It's a great deal and it's valid for lunch AND dinner. The Thai spicy fried rice is delicious and the owner has memorized my order: Thai spicy chicken fried rice, no eggs, and crazy spicy with basil! I also really like the tangy salad dressing. 

The owner is a lovely young man and he runs the family business. He always has a smile on his face and is ever so pleasant. I can rarely finish my meal and I usually brown bag the leftovers. You get great value for money!"}
{"text":"Fabulous quantity for the price. Love the mango salad, pad Thai was good. Home-y feel and nice staff. No complaints."}
{"text":"I am basing my review of this place pre and post - renovation which was made a few months ago in winter 2017.

Environment 3/5
A few months ago during the late winter/early spring, it was closed for renovation.  The flooring and walls seems to be cleaner but overall, it still has the out-dated 90's look of Asian restaurants aka no style.  I don't mind the tacky aesthetic interior if only the food was decent... 

Quality of Food 2/5
I only order one item, their chicken pad thai.  Pre-renovation, this dish was popular where it looked and tasted great.  Post-renovation, nothing at all like before.  The quality has definitely gone down.  The dish has bland-colour and had very little chicken pieces.  Lots of noodles but there were very little flavour in the sauce (food colouring?  or diluting the sauce?).  The chicken pieces I did find were thinly sliced and flavour-less (most likely frozen).  The lime slice was bruised and almost rotten where I immediately brushed it off from the pad thai for fear of contamination.

Service 2/5
The restaurant was under staffed when I and current staff seem to be new.  Perhaps, the original owners sold it to a new family while renovating because I noticed there wasn't a lunch crowd.  This place used to be very busy and attentive staff but ever since the renovation (and new owners?), the service and lunch crowd has been depleted. 

Overall 2/5
I will not be coming back here and judging by the lack of customers, it may close within the year.  I will be taking my pad thai cravings back to Salad King!

The restaurant's size is large.  I hope a new authentic Japanese restaurant will take its place since Dundas St W is unofficially becoming J-town. ^_~"}
{"text":"Food is absolutely disgusting in this place. Found a piece of hair in the pad thai. 

The chicken was cold and tasted frozen. They put way too much Soy sauce in everything. Save your money and time and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"The prices are great, the service (both eat-in and takeout) fast, and the noodle dishes and curries are very competitive, given what you're paying. Unfortunately, their quality has been declining over the past year or so."}
{"text":"I love this little restaurant. The owner Peter is always smiling and gets the food to you so quickly. The prices are amazing but they do not skimp on quality or deliciousness. I probably take out here once a week. 

Recommendations: glass noodles, pad Thai and seafood fried rice."}
{"text":"wrong order. whaaatt? curry ok. instant noodle. meh."}
{"text":"I always come here for their basil fried rice. It's so good and fragrant. I've tried other dishes but I didn't like it that much because their basil fried rice is the best imo. I would suggest seafood fried rice as well but definitely try the basil fried rice. Warning: they use Asian basil which is more pungent than non Asian basil."}
{"text":"Had the Rainbow Veggie stir-fry. Came with a side of white rice. Tasted great and wasn't too salty. Felt like home cooking."}
{"text":"Got the lunch combo with soup, spring roll and basil fried rice. The portions are huge for the price you pay. The fried rice was done very well, perfect level of spiciness if you order 'medium' spice level and had a good amount of veggies, rice and chicken ratio.
Also got the mango sticky rice and it was absolutely amazing. One of the best thai desserts I've had, will definitely order that again."}
{"text":"Good service, typical franchise Thai food. Limited seating, Cold veggie rolls are great!"}
{"text":"This place was right around the corner from my hotel...it wasn't packed, offered quick take out, and seating. 

I got a few items and the service was really fast, the food tasted good, and the double spicy was a good spicy (and I love spicy). 

I wouldn't say it was anything \"super duper\" but it was good, and so if you are looking for a quick Thai meal this place will do you pretty good."}
{"text":"Like everyone has said.. simple, cheap, and quick thai food!"}
{"text":"Looking to cleanse your colon clean right away, look no further and come to this place if you've been constipated or want to cleanse your colon because you for sure will have that within 2hrs after eating here....lousy Thai food with low grade spring rolls and soup, I got the chicken pad Thai and the chicken tasted very crunchy, my friends and I thinks it may be vegetarian chicken but whatever it tasted too sweet....my friend waited at least 30mins for his red curry dish where by the time we finished out food he got his....if you looking for Thai food please avoid this place at all cost, you've been warned"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner during a very busy weekend. Service was friendly. Yummy dumplings that came with the lunch/dinner combo menu.

Food took forever to come. Basil chicken tastes great. But seriously 4 tables after us waited 30min without food when the only came 5 min after us. We were done eating and they still didn't get their meals."}
{"text":"This place has value on it's side, there's no doubt. The shrimp basil fried rice was delicious, full of umami that is most likely from MSG or soy sauce. There were at least five decent sized shrimp and there was at least three bowl fulls of rice. It was all accented with the lovely scent of Thai basil with carrots, green peppers and onion studded throughout. The taros spring rolls we got were hot and crisp, but way too greasy. The taro was flavourful, but it was only taro...I would have expected some thing more to add to the taro. The only thing that would make me hesitate to go back would be the atmosphere. And I don't mean the service, our water glasses were always full and the servers were attentive. However, the whole place just seemed really sad on a Saturday night when most restaurants will be rocking. The place seemed to have a dark cloud over it and it was hard to stay any longer than we needed to."}
{"text":"Everything is very good, from welcoming, service, menu variety, freshness of ingredients, and the price was good for this quality.
Will come back for sure"}
{"text":"This is one of those toss ups: do you want really cheap, big portions, or do you want excellent food? With Evergreen Thai, you can only have the first option. 
The food is ok. Nothing wrong with it, but it is incomparable with some of the top-notch Thai places in the city (and some pretty close to it, too). That being said, you cannot beat their lunch deal for $12.50 where you get spring rolls, salad, soup and your main dish. Absurdly cheap. But again, it's not like you're eating at SukhoThai or PAI, so you get what you pay for.

The service is great - they are friendly and quick to serve. If you wanna grab a quick lunch, or do a takeout, that is cheap, low-fuss and with large portions, this is your place.
I personally quite enjoyed their Pad Thai and their dumplings, but had no patience for the red curry... too watery and just not that flavourful. Again, you get what you pay for..."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today. I pre-ordered my lunch on the phone and it was ready within 5 minutes. As soon as I walked in, I was pleasantly greeted within seconds. Everyone was very nice and polite, service was great. The quantity of the food is also great--very similar to that of Salad King--but a lot cheaper. Although it definitely wasn't the best tasting Thai (I ordered chicken green curry), it was still very enjoyable. I will definitely end up coming back!"}
{"text":"Waste of money. Tasteless food. NOT authentic. Go to Pai (18 Duncan St) for real Thai food."}
{"text":"This is my favorite cheap Thai restaurant. It's not authentic but it's quite good! They have raised the prices over the past year probably to accommodate the increase to minimum wage. The food is made to order and quite tasty. Most of their dishes are under $12. A good bargain if you need a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"Spicy seafood fried rice and basil fried rice are good."}
{"text":"I have been to over 20 thai restaurants and EVERGREEN has always been the best place for: Red Curry Chicken, Chicken Pad-Sew and Spring Rolls!!!  YUMMY!  I have brought many friends and co-workers to this restaurant and everyone got addicted to these dishes and agreed that they are the best at Evergreen.  Basil Fried Rice is also good!  But, my favourite dishes are the ones mentioned above.  BEATS any thai restaurant for these 2 items."}
{"text":"Very bland coconut milk soup, the glass noodles looked much better than they tasted. Service was very slow, and after waiting 20 minutes after I was done eating, I finally had to walk to the counter to tell them I wanted my check. They were not busy at all. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Stopped in on Sunday around 5:30pm.... Restaurant was near empty... Server was prompt and friendly.... Ordered large shrimp red curry dish, spicy... Friend ordered same but green curry, not so spicy.... Excellent flavour, reasonable portion... Nothing spectacular, but above average ..."}
{"text":"Very nice staff and home made cooking. Fresh ingredients and nicely spiced meals. Remains an on-the-go place but that's really worth it. Prices may be a little bit high for the portion sizes, but I would definitvely go back there, for a take-out lunch."}
{"text":"The taste food is average compare to Thai restaurants in Toronto. The one that I like is their food is fresh and hot. I ordered a crazy spicy and I had a runny nose :) but hot and sour soup is no taste"}
{"text":"Sadly...not very good. :( Quick and friendly service though. Convenient location for me. Got a combo... so it included soup, salad and a spring roll. Spring roll was delish! Soup and salad got tossed cause the salad looked super sketch and the soup tasted weird. had the pad thai which to me was very bland and unflavourful. Likely, wont be back"}
{"text":"Super fast service but did not like the fact that the server and cook was the same person.  This is doomed for failure when the cook is the person who takes your order.  Thai Fried rice with chicken and shrimp was not so good.  I eat a lot of Thai food and this Thai Fried rice taste more like Chinese food.  Was not impressed at all with the taste.  I gave it 2 stars because of the super fast service being that the server and cook was the same person.  I second guessed if the food would be cooked all the way."}
{"text":"All I can really say is that it was super affordable but just didnt fit the bill for me as far as good quality thai food.."}
{"text":"The Tom Yum Soup was very good. Thai Basil fried rice is tasty."}
{"text":"I agree with most of the reviews here that the food is ok. The lunch special was $12.99, I thought it was a little bit expensive. The lunch include one spring roll and one egg drop soup. They were pretty average. I ordered the basil beef, the presentable was nice when it came out and the portion seemed decent. But the beef wasn't very tender and a bit rough.

I did like the comfortable seating inside the restaurant, which was way better than salad king. The waiter seemed nice. But I would probably not go back for the quality of food."}
{"text":"Amidst all the insanely busy eateries on Dundas was this Thai restaurant that sat empty, so my friends and I decided to park ourselves here for the evening to try Thai cuisine.  There were lots of selections on the menu, but what caught my attention was their combination menu.  For $15, you get soup, salad, dumplings and an entree of your choice from the list.  So I chose chicken red curry.  All the side dishes were good.  The main dish, however, fell a bit flat in terms of taste.  There were a lot of vegetables in the bowl and the red curry didn't taste that great.
As far as the service goes, the food got to us pretty slowly.  My friend ordered a beef dish but they brought out a chicken dish to her.  We also waited for our bill to come to us, but in the end, we had to call the server to get his attention. 
So, 3 star it gets."}
{"text":"Cheap, inauthentic Thai food with annoying background noises... 

Came here on a sunday evening, and the place was empty, most likely due to it being Canada day long weekend. We ordered the Beef Pad Sew and Shrimp Basil Fried Rice. For the pad sew, the noodles were not the authentic wide flat noodles nor were they fresh because they clumped up together. The flavors were boring and the beef was dry. Meanwhile, the fried rice was burned and overseasoned with soy sauce, pepper, and too much oil. The only saving grace was the shrimp. 

There was also very loud and annoying rumbling noises that came from the AC and refrigerator every few minutes that just ruined the ambiance of the place. I couldn't wait to just leave after my meal. 

Next, I couldn't comment much on the service since there was hardly any customers that night. Nothing but ordinary. 

Overall, quite a disappointing experience. I wouldn't go back here unless to order cheap take out."}
{"text":"I've been here twice in the past year - it's relatively inexpensive, but won't win any awards for presentation. Decor is exactly what you'd expect for a low-cost Asian place, and the server, while well-intentioned, was absolutely clueless. She consistently forgot our orders, had zero recollection of whose bill was whose (even after the third time she came back to re-print them), and despite two attempts, still entered errors onto everyone's receipt.

Portion sizes are about par for the course and quality is similarly middling. Beer is relatively cheap, though all bottled."}
