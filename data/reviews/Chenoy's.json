{"text":"Christmas Day brunch here, family tradition. Crowded, busy, and great smoked meat. Not a formal environment by any means, which is perfect for the day.  24 hrs/365 day"}
{"text":"Good food. Poor service. I ordered fries, a smoked meat sandwich, 6 wings and a baked potato for my guest. It was pricey but good. When the food came out, the blonde older waitress came with an extra fry stating they are out of baked potatoes and just gave the fries. She should have asked first. Suppose my guest did not want fries (which she would have been charged)? Waitress seemed clueless also about the amount of wings one can get.  She also did not check with us while we ate. I gave a mediocre tip and left. Did not hear a 'thank you' from her.  They are better for take-out."}
{"text":"I remember the old place in Snowdon.  The name is the same, but I doubt if anyone from the old restaurant  is around any more. I had an old fashioned, lean smoked meat sandwich, fries, coleslaw and of course, a diet cherry Pepsi. I needed a car jack to pry my mouth open wide enough to take a bite out of that delicious sandwich. Yum, yum and more yum! The fries, while tasting OK, were not the deli fries of yesteryear, soggy in a tasty way, and the coleslaw, again while OK, didn't have that vinegary, \"bite\". The Chalet BBQ on Sherbrooke near Decarie, has the fries and Cole slaw I really like. I enjoyed the sandwich immensely though and the staff was very friendly and fun to chat with. I'll reserve a higher rating for my next experience there, and Im definitely going back for more. I'm not used to Canadian dollar pricing, so I can't comment on the value. All I can say is that they really gave me the meat!"}
{"text":"I've only been there late at night and the food was never good. Might be better during normal hours but I doubt it."}
{"text":"Ribs were quite good. Service was excellent and friendly. Family-friendly place. I think this is my new family restaurant."}
{"text":"It isn't what it used to be, for sure.  Back in the day, it was the only place to eat after the clubs closed but there are other options.  I would go to MacDonalds before I overpaid for the lack lustre and really limp smoked meat that is being served as one of Chenoy's signatures.  It isn't a clean as it could be, our table was \"sticky\" and this was at dinner time, not at 3:30 am.   The fries were hard and by the taste or lack thereof?  Frozen.  Sorry but I'll go to Abie's on St. Jean if I want a good smoked meat.  Chenoy's has passed its prime."}
{"text":"Stopped here the other day for dinner with the family.  Chenoys is one of the original smoked meat places in Montreal.  This location is on the west island.  We ordered the Quebecoise and two of the super smoked meat plates.  Service was quick and efficient, and the food was wonderful.  The Quebecoise has a smoked meat sandwich, poutine, cole slaw and dill pickle, 1/2 chicken and BBQ sauce.  My husband loves this meal and reorders it every time we're here.  Other members of our party had the super smoked meat platter which is a smoked meat sandwich,coleslaw and a dill pickle, and French fries.  The food was fresh and tasty, I would recommend this place to anyone for an authentic deli taste from this region of Canada.  We ended up the meal by sharing a slice of Strawberry cheesecake.  The cost was $21.95 for the Quebecoise, $14.95 for the smoked meat platters,$7.95 for the cheesecake.  I will return!"}
{"text":"I used to frequent this place almost every night in the 90s and hadn't been back to Montreal in a LONG time. With family in tow, I remembered this restaurants to be a good quality and value. To my surprise, when i walked into the restaurant, visually, it hadn't changed a bit and looked like I had stopped back in time. i did notice that there were a lot of elderly people eating there and it wasn't as busy, as it used to be.   The hostess was nice but took her time to seat us. However, I attribute this to being on Toronto time and some places can't keep up. Sitting down, I had a window booth and i noticed that the booth really wasn't clean, and parts of the restaurant had also been ignored. This place could use a scrub down. Interestingly, the bathroom was okay but the stall was miniscule, kind of like trying to get into a clown car.   The children's meals seemed to be a little expensive for me but when we saw the portions, they were HUGE!!!  I ordered a super Montreal Smoked meat sandwich and my wife ordered the regular order; however, when they came, it seemed like they were the same size. I can assure you there was a difference on my bill.   Being on vacation, my children were lured into buying a gumball and won a discount on our bill. When I presented it to the waitress, she advised me that it was only for take out. In the words of Larry, Darryl and Darryl, it was almost like the bakery was advertising that bear claws were on sale but unfortunately, it was a come on.   Being in Montreal, my children hadn't seen mile high cheese cakes, so they asked to order one. So, we ordered a strawberry cheesecake that looked really scrumptious. What we got was something completely different than what was in the case. another come on, the cheese cake wasn't even an inch high, with strawberries on top of it. This looked like the leftovers from yesterday's batch of cheesecake put together to serve to some unsuspecting Ontarians.   Unfortunately, even though my sandwich wasn't mile high, nor my cheesecake, the sum of my bill was a lot bigger than what i had wanted. Unfortunately, I can't condone this restaurant and I hope that some day, it gets put out of it's misery."}
{"text":"I am an ex-Montrealer who lives in Los Angeles now.  I have gone to Chenoys two to three times a year whenever I vist my family in Montreal.  This time was a little disppointing.  The smoked meat sandwhich was spectacular!!! Still one of the best in the city.  However, the fries were sub-par.   Although the wait staff was attentive and friendly, it took almost 30 minutes for our food to come out of the kitchen.  Half an hour for a smoked meat sandwich.  A bigger problem was that the restaurant has become run down and wasn't being cleaned properly.  Faded pictures on the wall as well as scratched and chipped wood on the booths. It just is no longer being maintained as it was in the good old days when the late great Morty Chenoy was running the place.  I won't be surprised if they are no longer in business the next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Three of us got the grilled cheese sandwich. What a mistake... the oil they used to fry the sandwich tasted \"off\" and the cheese they used were Kraft singles, not real cheese! It was one slice per sandwich too which wasn't much cheese. The bacon also tasted like ready crisp bacon. All three of us did not enjoy it.   The Chenoy Poutine was pretty good, decent size too. Could use more gravy though.   Apple pie also had a strange texture. These guys look like they specialize in smoked meat so I recommend sticking to that.   On the pro side, all the employees were really nice, and there is no cold draft coming from the windows since they have heaters at each one."}
{"text":"When with such importunity the reference of fresh fruits(in the breakfast menu), do bring forth only of well described produce. The cut honeydew and cantaloup melons we're clearly overrippen per the squishy texture and the translucide blemishes around the edges. My wife had the smoked meat plate. The sandwich is flavorful but irrelevant when the cole slaw tasted expired.   Alas, the waitress was quite pleasant and attended well her patrons."}
{"text":"Especially good for breakfast after a night of drinking... everything is available on the menu - from smoke meet to grilled chicken, hamburgers, and all day breakfasts.   Service is fast and they also have a full bar.   Great that they are open 24/7/365."}
{"text":"For a divey diner this place is great! 5 stars is based solely on breakfast and service. The omelettes we ordered were perfectly cooked, the homefries were some of the best roasted potatoes I have had, and the smoked meat......  OH. MY. GOD. words cannot describe how delectable the smoked meat was. For $4.95 you can add a side of smoked meat to your breakfast. The portion is enormous and was enough for two people to split. We ordered it medium fat/lean and it was the perfect proportion of lean to fat- full of flavor but not overpowering and wasteful. Our waitress was as happy as a clam. She was prompt, friendly, and always made sure that our coffee cups weren't empty.  The smoked meat they have here to bring home is reasonably priced and phenomenal. This was my first time having Montreal smoked meat- Chenoy's gets an A+."}
{"text":"Wow, Great smoked meat!!! Gigantic Matzo ball soup, Fresh salad instead of fries and good friendly service. All at a decent price. Too much food to finish in one sitting."}
{"text":"This is our place to go when we have big family events: it's open all night, you can't ask for more variety, and the portions are great. They're very friendly and lots of booths to have a great time."}
{"text":"Good bang for your buck! Excellent portions, good taste, the best fries I've had in awhile and great tv screens to watch the game.  Service is mediocre for a place that only had two tables but forming real standards pretty good. We switched servers once we sat in a place without the wind blowing on our heads and the waitress was nice and courteous.   Definitely try out their special platters advertised in the papers acting as your mat and don't get the half rack of ribs and sandwich because you can get more good and variety by trying the platters at a better price.   All in all a good deal And great for groups. Didn't get to try their cheesecake which is also what they are known for. The smoked meat is excellent here and I would say its top 5 in montreal."}
{"text":"This place is an institution, if you want smoked meat then I say drive another 2min to Abie's, but you can always count on Chenoy's on being open during the holidays, which is nice. I always end up here on New Year's Day because nothing else is opened. I've had their poutines, smoked meat, stir fried liver and it wasn't that impressive. But I don't think people come here for the food, it's been around since 1936, it's your old school, comfort food diner."}
{"text":"My friend and I felt like having some smoke meat and since I was taking out my friend for his birthday, we decided to go to the West Island since it was somewhat close to where he works.  Chenoy's wasn't actually our first choice. We had wanted to go to a place that we went to about a year ago in the same area called \"West Island Deli\" but upon arriving where \"West Island Deli\" used to be, it was no longer there and there was another restaurant.  My friend then mentioned a smoke meat place inside Fairview Pointe-Claire so we drive to Fairview Pointe-Claire only to find that it was gone. I think he mentioned the name was \"Le Deli de Fairview\".  Running out of options with my friend's lunch time being wasted, but in the mood for smoke meat, we decided to drive a few blocks to Chenoy's Deli.  There was enough parking around the restaurant when we arrived at ~12:00pm. Both my friend and I had the lunch special smoke meat sandwich with fries, coleslaw, a pickle slice, and a soft drink. I opted to get the soup of the day and the dessert for a few bucks more (this was mentioned on the menu).  The soup of the day was a cream soup. I'm not crazy about cream soups (with the exception of mushroom soup) but I thought this soup was good. I thought that the smoke meat was okay. It isn't my favourite type of smoke meat since I prefer it more dry and for the smoke meat in the bread to be like \"broken bits\" (similar to the style of Schwartz's). The smoke meat at Chenoy's is shaped/sliced like pieces of ham (but obviously is not ham). My friend also mentioned that that he felt the same way. The amount of smoke meat in the bread was a good amount. There wasn't anything special about the fries. They were the \"McCain\" type straight fries similar in shape/size/cut to what you would get at McDonald's. Although, I prefer the thick cut fries of a \"La Belle Province\", I liked the fries but my friend wasn't crazy about them. Coleslaw as good and pickle was also good. For the soft drink, I got Diet Coke or Diet Pepsi. The glass was a decent size glass (I've had smaller glasses at Reuben's downtown).  I had finished my smoke meat sandwich, coleslaw, and pickle and was almost finished my drink while I continued to eat my fries. The server passed by a few times but never offered my friend and I a glass of water when we finished our drinks. He did pass by when it was time to bring my dessert. I asked what it was and he mentioned it was ice cream. I wasn't offered a choice of a flavour and when he came back with my ice cream, it was a scoop of chocolate ice cream. Even though I like chocolates, I'm not a big fan of chocolate ice cream.  In the table across from us, someone ordered a smoke meat pizza and we started talking to him. His smoke meat pizza looked very large and was probably enough for 2 people. Also, since the pizza and the smoke meat on top of it are placed in an oven, the smoke meat looked more like what the smoke meat that my friend and I enjoy (dry smoke meat and bits of smoke meat).  When we finished, the server asked if it would be two bills or one bill and I mentioned one. My friend and I \"argued\" about who would pay for the bill and the server then joked that he would give the bill to the person who gave the higher tip. When he brought the bill, I grabbed it before my friend and then went to the cash register in the front of the restaurant and paid.  I give Chenoy's three stars. I felt that the server should have given us glasses of water even though our meals included a soft drink and when he passed by and saw that we were finished our drinks, he didn't offer any water. I would have also preferred to have been offered a choice of the ice cream flavour since chocolate is one of my least favourite flavours of ice cream."}
{"text":"Great service and pretty good smoked meat sandwiches. Not as good as Schwartz but probably the second best smoked meat sandwich in Montreal and surrounding area. Only reason why they didn't get 5 stars was because the fries could be better. If they offered hand-cut fries then I'm sure they would get more business."}
{"text":"I came by for lunch 10 years ago. I remember it was very busy and we had to wait for a table. We came by here for lunch today and it wasn't that busy. The restaurant still looks the same. Food was plentiful. Price was reasonable.  Especially if you order their lunch special. The special includes soup of the day. Today was spinach rice soup. That was pretty good and not over salted!  Bbq burger did not come with veggies. We had to ask them for lettuce and tomatoes. My meal also came with chocolate ice cream which was excellent.   Cheesecake was funky tasting. I don't know if this is how Canada makes cheesecakes but it was grainy and yellow. That's a big meh for me."}
{"text":"Français après  Ok, you're really drunk, pass 3 am and stuck in the west island. You got no car and you've OD on Tim Hortons. There is your last resort. But again, McCain fries, Cheap Pickle, bad colesaw salad, not so good burger. Questionable freshness and depress overall feeling.   Ok, t'as trop bu, t'es saoul, coincé dans l'ouest de Montréal à 3:00 du mat et tu n'as pas de véhicule (pas possible d'aller au McD'S) et la semaine vous mangez juste trop de Tim hortons. Voici votre dernier recours. Mais encore, c'est des frites surgelés, des mauvais pickle, une salade de choux médiocre et un burger par trop bon. Une fraicher questionable et une atmosphère déprimante. C'est ça Chenoy's"}
{"text":"came here with my mom for my yearly smoked meat sandwich (visiting the parents, from san francisco, for the holidays). altogether, it did the job and satisfied my craving, but i've had better smoked meat."}
{"text":"Great Family Restaurant.   My wife, I and our 3 kids stopped on our way home for breakfast, after coming in town to see a Canadiens game. The breakfast was really good and the service was excellent. The boys had a stuffed chocolate banana crepes, my wife and daughter had the eggs Benedict, and I had the big breakfast with ham, sausage, bacon and eggs. Note: The eggs Benny has a lot of hollandaise, so if you don't like too much sauce then ask them to go easy on it.   We liked the breakfast so much we asked about getting deli sandwiches to go for the road (we live near Toronto). Our waitress did up a \"to go\" pack including a pound of pastrami, a loaf of fresh rye, 2 salads, with utensils and condiments - all for $25!!! We ate like kings on the ride home.   We will definitely stop in again for breakfast and a lunch \"for the road\" on our next trip to Montreal to see the Canadiens play - Go Habs Go"}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: The restaurant is decent on the inside. It feels like it's been in the area for quite a while and is a bit old (you can tell by the older interior design).  FOOD: The smoked meat lasagna is very good! Although it's a little bit salty, it's still good. The smoked meat spaghetti is too runny for my taste. The sauce was too watery. The combo dishes are decent. Overall, the food isn't bad but I don't think I'd come here very often.  PRICE: Prices are decent and are good for the portions.  SERVICE: Service is good, not the BEST. The waiters seem kind of glub but they do what they have to do. The only time I had an issue is when we asked for a simple grilled cheese and it took over 30 minutes to get to us... However all of our other ordered plates came before."}
{"text":"The nice thing about this place is that it's open 24 hours.  So when I am visiting and we have a hankering for some poutine or smoked meat and it's 3am, this is where we go.  But to be fair, I've gone here for lunch and dinner and it hasn't been much different.   I feel like the prices are really expensive for what you get.  The smoked meat is ok, but there are definitely better places to get it.  The poutine is so so, but again, at certain times of night, it's not terrible.  Because of the 24 hour status, you get some riff raff as well."}
{"text":"We went there for desert last night. I ordered a slice of ferrero rocher cake, and my nephew ordered a slice of lemon merengue pie.   The cake was good itself was good but tasted nothing like ferrero rocher. The merengue of the pie was sour. We brought this to the attention of our waitress. She brought the slice into the kitchen and returned saying this is what it's supposed to taste like. He wasn't offered a different desert, and we were ignored the rest of the time we were there.   We paid the bill in full but for the first time ever, I didn't leave a tip.   The food was sour, the service was horrid and needles to say we won't be back."}
