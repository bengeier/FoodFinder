{"text":"Definitely a best buy for sushi,  The fact that it is delicious makes it even better.  Usually excellent service.  Lots of choices for everyone."}
{"text":"The best sushi place in Arizona! Staffs are friendly and variety combos and half and half combos for customers! Miso soup, salad, and desert come as complementary!"}
{"text":"One word awesome  A must , see put it on your bucket list Good service clean  Awesome"}
{"text":"Love this place. I love the soup and salad that gets served before you dish and the apple at the end for the dessert. The sushi is great and the pricing fair. I have always had a great experience here and look forward to many more visits."}
{"text":"Like this place a lot, they make great sushi that is reasonably priced and consistently good.  Only reason for the four stars is the hit and miss service, I have had to go fetch the server to get my bill before, but to be fair we go on the weekends when it's pretty busy.  Staff is always friendly and we love the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Best sushi place in Arizona!! Their rolls r fresh and huge! Literally they r bigger than average and they also have mixed rolls so u don't get tired of eating the same sushi over and over again. U also get free miso soup, salad, and dessert. I don't like their fried rice that comes w the Bento box though, it's flavorless and tastes odd and their Korean food is okay. If u go, get the sushi! It's the best. Also the service is awesome cuz They r nice and are always refilling ur drinks."}
{"text":"I thought I'd be in trouble for trying a place that has happy hour all the time. Who would've known that fresh nigri, sashimi and rolls would follow the reasonable prices?  - Soup, salad and breadsticks... oops, I meant dessert, with your meal - Don't puss out when you sit outside without misters - Go for the healthier sake instead of Sopporo big gulps"}
{"text":"I would avoid this place at all costs. The soup was nowhere near warm, the seaweed in the sushi rolls was rubbery and could be used like a rubber band. Even the fried shrimp had pieces of tail or something all throughout. And the ingredients were not fresh.   I have been to many Sushi places throughout the valley, and this one is by far the worst. The only reason I gave it one star is because yelp forces you to choose at least one."}
{"text":"This place is GREAT! Super friendly staff, and the food is excellent! Well worth the price for a soup salad and desert with you meal!. This place goes the extra mile and deserves all 5 stars"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh.... I fell in love with this place the first time I went there. I think I usually get #32 or #33, whichever one has the epic roll combination.  The sushi pieces are huge and one roll will definitely get you full.  The workers are super nice, and how can anyone resist all-day happy hour? If you're a friend of the owner, they also give you free dessert, and the dessert is such a masterpiece!  Mochi, oranges, apples, pocky and chocolate sauces arranged in a pretty display. The roll + sake bomb combo is a pretty good deal too.. I only wish that the 2 sake bombs I had didn't make me regurgitate my delicious dinner."}
{"text":"This place was definitely a surprise. I'm from LA and had to move here. Lets just say moving to a state without an ocean in site makes you a little skeptical about the sushi.   They're happy hour specials are a great deal and the sushi was pretty fresh and tasty. Also, they have a great selection in sashimi.   They have good food, great service, all for a reasonable price.  Btw, the avocado salad is tasty, but extremely large portion. Good to split with someone else."}
{"text":"Here is the deal: Masa sushi is the new favorite. I am addicted going forward. As a picky California girl, I give you my word this food is AMAZING -and- the boyfriend agrees!!! A few recommendations even though I'm sure anything you order will be perfection: red dragon roll, masa roll, popcorn crab over a California roll."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. I would love to go back here.  They have the lunch bento combo, they are the best price and best quality I have ever had. They also serve miso soup and salad for free and there is a cute dessert at the end for free as well. Oh and half and half deal is pretty good too. Awesome sushi place!"}
{"text":"Friendly service but food are not authentic Japanese cuisine.... Ordered fatty tuna...it resembled \"toro\" from outside but it was definitely not a melt in your mouth toro I am familiar with... And it was seared...."}
{"text":"Their spicy tuna salad is my favorite of all time!!!!!!!!  They will accommodate your request with a delicious version of your order every time:)  Generous portions for great prices and delicious food!"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi restaurant!  Everyone is so nice and best food in Phoenix region!  Beautiful pieces of art on the dishes. Must try."}
{"text":"Miso soup was great. Service was good. However, my rolls didn't taste very fresh. Prices were low, but I'd rather pay a little more for better product."}
{"text":"Masa is fantastic! It has a really nice ambiance, with little umbrellas hanging from the ceiling. The service is usually good- even when it's not their normal standard of good, it's never bad. The sushi is the best I've had in town and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Masa is our go to date night restaurant. The sushi is great and tastes fresh and the prices are great as well. There's rarely ever a wait and the service is really sweet."}
{"text":"The company's leadership reached out to make amends shortly after I posted my review.  I appreciate the quick, thoughtful response, and I have decided not to do business with the company."}
{"text":"Great sushi and roll! Free miso soup and salad. We had several rolls and they were all really good. Fish tasted very fresh. Service was very friendly and good. We came on a Friday evening and it was very busy. But sushi came out very fast. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"BEST SUSHI IN THE VALLEY. I have searched for many other places that would compare and I always land right back at Masa. This place is AMAZING. The staff is super friendly and even remembers our order from previous times! (no shame). Try the Tempura California roll but as for it spicy! Absolutely divine. I cannot find the words to describe my love for this place so just go experience Masa for yourself! Also, the free miso soup, salad, and dessert makes for an amazing meal!"}
{"text":"Called to order take out and they told me we aren't taking orders because they were too busy inside. Told me to try back tomorrow or come in and eat. I would have waited for the sushi but wasn't given the option.  Not to mention they were horribly rude over the phone.  I never have tried their food and now I definitely wont be."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years. The sushi is okay. It's nothing outstanding, but it's decent food for the price. There are a ton of menu options, but at least there are pictures. The menu is funny...\"all kind spicy fish\" and enjoyable to read/laugh at. I love the free soup and dessert. The service is good. I have no complaints about this place and would rate it higher if I loved the food more."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review based on how dang cold the beer is!!   I love it! Love that you can do half rolls too!"}
{"text":"100% my favorite sushi place. For the amount you get the rolls are a great price, and they're always quality. And, while it's not geared for it, it's actually a great spot to watch sports. Good TVs, and they were  nice enough to even put the volume on the game when I asked. I've been coming here for months and I don't see that stopping."}
{"text":"Awful! All products from true foods and restaurant depot (per the \"chef\"). All bottom of the barrel. All frozen seafood (again, per chef). Over breaded and drenched in ponzu to mask the poor quality. If you don't know your sushi you will leave unimpressed at the least. If you enjoy quality sushi, you will ask for your money back and leave hungry as we did. Skip it."}
{"text":"I thought I'd never utter these words...but \"monkey balls\" are amazingly delicious. Who would have thought to put spicy tuna, cream cheese, a fresh mushroom, and deep fry it, to make the most delicious couple bites of heaven.  Masa is by far the best sushi spot in Phoenix, and believe me I've had my fair share of the raw fish. You can start every meal with a crisp salad, ginger dressing, and a cup of the best miso soup! I'd highly recommend the spicy spicy roll, or the happy hour number 33, which mixes that and the AZ Roll, A-mazing.  Don't forget to save a little room for the bird dessert they bring out. I must say I thought we were very special, until I looked around and saw they brought them to everyone. Fresh sliced apples, with whip cream, oranges, AND chocolate dipped little bread sticks...who could want more.  I hate to YELP this, because, well...I don't want to share my favorite spot, but I must give five stars where its due! Thank you Masa for giving me hope that sushi can be found in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Great portions, complimentary soup and dessert. I love that they have a patio for outdoor dining and the atmosphere is casual and comfortable. Unfortunatly, the last 2 times I've had the same waitress which isn't a good thing. No smile no personality and bare minimum service. Hopefully the other waitresses are better. Aside from that, the food is amazing for a guy who likes sushi but is not a fanatic. Strongly suggest better service could improve overall dining experience and up the rating to a 5, but it's still my go to place for sushi."}
{"text":"Love the monkey ball here, it is yummmmmmy!!!! My kids love the California roll and tempera roll."}
{"text":"Ill never forget the day I went into the bathroom and saw 3 cockroaches.  Now don't get me wrong, I love masa! The sushi is absolutely amazing... The salad and soup... Great!  They told me they put pineapple in the dressing! You can actually buy it in bottles.  Plus the dessert at the end is really cute.  However none of this really matters... It's not easy to eat after a near death experience with cockroaches."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first time here after being told by different people to give it a try. I've been to Japan and this is about authentic as you can get in the east valley. Had a few rolls and Oh. My. God. Best I've had in a long time. That staff was friendly and we even got free desert after! They have gained a new regular customer"}
{"text":"The sushi was messy. I love the concept of the combo plates but nothing I would go back for. Quite disappointing."}
{"text":"I love walking in to this place.  Four people yell at you in Japanese.  I have no idea what they're saying (for all I know, it could be something like \"Get out, white devils!\"), but it's fun and exciting and makes you feel welcome.  Furnishings are tasteful, in an IKEA sort of way.  Lights are indirect--bright bulbs shone through red and purple paper umbrellas.  The walls are covered with Polaroids of people who have fulfilled some specific requirement, but I've never worked out what exactly the requirement is, despite having ended up on the wall myself on two separate occasions.  Windows are hung with fabric prints of Japanese art.  Tables are straight out of the business IKEA catalog--the leather chairs are super-comfortable, but avoid the wooden high-top chairs at all costs!  Environment is more casual and restaurant-y than somewhere like RA, but I feel a little out-of-place when I'm drinking a soda here.  I usually order one of their modestly priced sake bombs or Japanese beers.  The sushi here is amazing.  They have this cool happy hour menu that has half-and-half rolls separated by price.  The full menu has whole rolls, but I've never even cracked it because I like to get the half-and-halves for two reasons: first, if I'm being cheap-o one night, I know which side of the menu to inspect; second, I get to try several different things, even when I only go with one or two other people.  The rolls themselves are always well-prepared and wrapped tightly, but served with a minimal amount of presentation.  Rolls tend to be too big for one bite, so if you're still on training wheels with chopsticks, I recommend asking for a fork.  I have ordered two cooked items (other than tempura sushi rolls): chicken teriyaki and beef yakisoba.  The nicest word I could use for the chicken teriyaki would be \"bland.\"  I didn't taste the beef yakisoba until after someone else had doused it with soy sauce, but the one bite I had convinced me never again to order something cooked from their menu.  Honestly, it's never a problem anyway because I'm so nuts for the sushi.  Service is average-to-lousy.  Waitresses are sweet and polite, but really not very good at waitressing.  You'll wait ten minutes to get your drink and another ten to place your order; refills are free for non-alcoholic beverages (including their tasty iced green tea), but to get one you'll probably have to get up out of your seat to flag down an employee.  Before you order drinks, you're presented with a small bowl of fresh lettuce with Asian dressing (they call it \"salad,\" but it's just bagged iceburg lettuce with no other ingredients) and another small bowl of miso.  These are included in the price, as is the little peacock you receive with your check at the end of the meal.  The peacock is made from an apple, an orange, some whipped cream, and a few chocolate-dipped sesame sticks.  All in all, I recommend this place very highly for a casual dining experience.  It would be a great place to bring some out-of-town friends or relatives who like fresh Japanese cuisine.  It's not bar-y enough for happy hour, but it's a little too bar-y for me to ever consider taking in kids.  It's a little too noisy for a first date, but for an average night out with some friends it's perfect."}
{"text":"I found this place when I was trying to expand my sushi knowledge beyond Ra. And I couldn't be happier! Not only with the quality of the sushi, but the price, the service, atmosphere just overall the whole place. It didn't feel manufactured as your typical Ra. They start you off with a soup and salad, which are nothing special but still very good. And have all kinds of deals all day, its always happy hour. And the special rolls that are half and half of certain rolls are the best, as i like to try new things, and this lets me with out having to buy a whole roll. They also have deals where u get a good sized sake bombers a half n half roll and edamame for around $12. And that's just the sushi, they also have a bunch of other dishes that u can get deals on as well. All n all its a great place that I try to get to when i want good sushi and am prepared to spend about $60 between my fiance and myself. And we get a BUNCH of rolls!"}
{"text":"Masa Sushi has always been a good experience for me and my family. I have been taking people there for 6-7 years now and have never once has a bad experience or a less than delicious meal. The staff is always friendly and accommodating which keeps us coming back year after year."}
{"text":"Decent lil sushi joint. Small rolls. Great service and staff. They allowed to buy one roll and split it between two choices. Never seen that before"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this sushi place! I'm visitng my family in Arizona and being a huge sushi fanatic, they brought me to Masa and I am NOT disappointed! The sashimi was fresh and the pieces were SO full and large.  Some sushi places only put a small sliver on their sushi pieces, but Masa put very, VERY generous pieces in and on all their sushi pieces.  Definitely recommend this place- love it!   PS. Sorry if this review is a little too happy and ridden with grammatical mistakes.  I just love Masa too much."}
{"text":"Yet another korean owned sushi restaurant. Being korean-american, this doesn't bother me that much. It just means I'll order the korean stuff on the menu over the japanese stuff. I'm somewhat new to the area, so still exploring sushi restaurants and don't have much to compare to around here yet.  I was here for lunch, which was nice because of the lunch combo meals that you can get. We got the bulgogi combo (korean marinated beef) and I can't even remember what combo I got. I know it wasn't sushi or sashimi. But also to be clear...koreans do sushi rolls just as well as the japanese, and usually for cheaper. However, given how few Korean restaurants there are around here, eating at the korean owned sushi restaurants is a great way to get a quick korean food fix.  All in all, somewhat lackluster food, but perfectly reasonable for lunch. Doubt I will come here for dinner."}
{"text":"Sit down..BOOM... salad and soup......Boom Big Orion beer..hard to find I might add...Spicy spicy roll is top notch. Waitresses fast and good looking...wow.. Yes..I like this place."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place! Food is good, service is good, and authentic atmosphere! :) Try their stuffed jalapenos and spicy tuna salad. YUM. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This is our favourite sushi place in East valley. Good portions n ice cold beer. Always fresh n yummy."}
{"text":"Masa Sushi has ruined sushi for me because anywhere else I go cannot compare to the price, quality and service.  You will ALWAYS get a Miso soup, salad and dessert with every meal-never charged for it.  That was surprising to me at first, but this is just the way they do it.  They put a Korean twist on the sushi and being a fan of salmon, they really know how to make a sushi roll!  Gilbert is the sort of place you wouldn't expect one of the best- their fish is as fresh as it gets for AZ.  Try this place (esp happy hour) you wont regret it!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Good food, great atmosphere, and awesome service. I really enjoy the lunch bento combos and everything tastes pretty fresh The tempura isn't that great but overall it's always an enjoyable dining experience. The prices are great too, I would highly recommend this sushi restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Not worth the time salad had ice on it calamari was way over cooked. The service was good how ever. I won't be going back"}
{"text":"Our first time here, after trying many sushi places in the Phx metro area.  This place is the best... Low prices, huge servings of fish, low key atmosphere; all tables were full, even on a Sunday night.  The fish-to-rice ratio in the rolls was the highest we've seen!  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Sushi is fair, and cheap.  Some rolls are good, some are awful. The menu is a confusing mess and doesn't give a way to order many of the most common items.  Service is a real weak point.  Always understaffed."}
{"text":"I went here with my boyfriend and it was absolutely amazing. Delicious food and very polite and professional staff! I had an avocado roll that was delicious! Can't get enough of them."}
{"text":"Great food and good service. Their half and half rolls allow you to try new things     The spicy scallop sushi is very good"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. You get miso soup, salad and dessert with your order and the food is fantastic. The specials are AWESOME. The 50/50 rolls are great deals and the bugolgi is fantastic as well. The wait staff is all awesome. They are very nice and attentive."}
{"text":"I've been going to masa sushi for years now. Mostly because I don't have a say in the matter. [I hate fish] But the service is always good, good drinks, and yummy bentos. Its pretty cheap too! the combos are like two rolls for like 5 bucks. Very nice."}
{"text":"I love this place. It has some of the best food i have ever had!! My friend and i come every other week. Popcorn lobster is AWESOME."}
{"text":"We went to Masha's not knowing what to expect and we were pleasantly surprised. Happy hour is all day on Saturdays. The prices were very reasonable and everyone was super friendly and the service was fast.  The sushi tasted fresh too!"}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite sushi spot in all of Phoenix! Although I haven't been to every sushi restaurant out here, of the many many that I've tried I always find myself coming back to this one especially when I am just not in the mood to be disappointed. They have great customer service, very attentive servers. Their rolls are rolled to perfection-- just the right size with a balance ratio of fish to rice. Very flexible with substitution on their special rolls, a wide range when it comes to variety of rolls, and food is always fresh. Good service, easy-going, delicious, and affordable, you really can't ask for much more."}
{"text":"Went for dinner and the waitress was very rude and did not give us good service. The food was good and the sushi was also good. We felt the server did not give good service to us so we only left a couple dollars for a 30.00 check. Upon leaving and exiting the restaurant, the server chased us into the parking lot and demanded more money for the tip. She became abrupt and started threatening us and telling us she was calling the police. What a JOKE!   WE ARE NEVER GOING BACK THERE AGAIN, EVEN IF IT IS THE LAST PLACE ON EARTH!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place! My boyfriend brought me here for my birthday last year, and that was it, I was hooked!  The sushi is fantastic, and fairly priced. While you are waiting they provide a great salad and soup free of charge, and when you are finished they provide a little dessert free of charge also.  The staff is always prompt and friendly and the atmosphere is nice.  We actually have a Masa Sushi \"Fund\" because we love this place so much!"}
{"text":"The one down side is its a small venue if you wish to sit indoors.  Besides that I have always had a pleasant time eating here.  They have different options that allow you to try multiple rolls at once, so that you can find what you truly enjoy.  I am not a lover of mushrooms; however, their \"monkey ball\" sushi roll is amazing.  Talk about a burst of flavor.  Besides that and their other sushi rolls I also enjoy their yakisoba.  Go and try it out!"}
{"text":"So glad we came here tonight. First time and very impressed with service and delicious food!"}
{"text":"Amazing food don't miss this amazing place!!!! It's beyond good the food is fresh !! And the taste is one of a kind , this mom and pop place takes sushi to another depth , if your ever close stop in .... that is if you get a seat :)"}
{"text":"Love the food, so many flavorful combos to chose from. It's become a quick favorite. Never disappointed!"}
{"text":"I have to admit -  the California roll I had was one of the worst I have ever had. No fresh avocado. The used what seemed like guacamole. The crab meat  was a slimey crab salad. This made the seaweed too moist and chewy and hard to bite through. The teriyaki \"sauce\" on the chicken was pretty watered down, almost soupy in consistency. Did not stick to, so did not flavor much, the chicken. Doubt if I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place! I have never been disappointed in their food or service. Even as busy as they get at times, they are always attentive and friendly. The sushi chef is awesome and always acknowledges you when you arrive and leave. My family goes as often as we can. I personally do not eat sushi, but they have plenty of offerings that are veggie based. I love the cucumber and asparagus roll. I'm so thrilled that despite the bad economy Masa Sushi is doing well. I hope they are around for a long time! The only negative I have is they have a new sushi chef and he's a young kid. We experienced the food not being as awesome as it usually is when he's working. It won't prevent us from going back, just kind of a downer because I would think they would make sure he does things the same as the usual sushi chef."}
{"text":"Will not go back. This place is a hole in the wall and kind of dingy. It smelled funny. Service was rushed bordering on rude. Soup was lukewarm and bland. The monkeyball roll was downright gross.  Those things aside the spicy rainbow roll and lion king roll were ok. Nothing better than any other place in town.  The rolls were small and overpriced compared to other places."}
{"text":"Cute little sushi place. Service was great the atmosphere of the place was good. Their happy hour specials are amazing and food was great! Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"A staple of a local neighborhood sushi bar, Masa never fails to leave me feeling satisfied.  Now I must start with the obvious points to this friendly and cool place.  It is Korean owned.  Not that this generally would be a problem but I understand that in some instances Sushi reinterpreted through the eyes of Koreans is not exactly the same as that of a standard Japanese restaurant.  However, they manage to do a good job of finding some balance within the menu that caters to an Americanized audience while offering nods to us purist.  I understand they used Ponzu sauce, if you don't like it then don't come here!  I have to admit I've evolved into sort of a sushi snob in recent years.  I have traveled frequently to LA, SF and NY where I have had some of the best Japanese food outside of Nagoya.  What I appreciate about Masa is that they offer a decent extensive menu including Yakisoba (a favorite of mine), Terriyaki, Goyza and Seaweed Salads to name a few.  The size of the rolls for the price is unbeatable.  Granted they are not using the most expensive cuts of fish but it is generally decent (including their sashimi).  The specials they are offer (including the 24/7 happy hour) is truly unbeatable for a sushi restaurant.  This is probably the best valued sushi meal you will find in the East Valley.  The decor on the inside is modern and trendy.  It's a welcoming atmosphere for more of a casual spot but without being overly cliche for a \"sushi\" bar.  I also like the projector outside.  The service is always friendly and efficient.  I enjoy the instant miso and salad as well as the awesome desert at the end of every meal.  The family that runs the restaurant appear to be quite friendly as well.  I have to say that as a local resident I will continue to frequent Masa for as long as I live here."}
{"text":"I really like this place. We ordered the Platinum sushi platter and the pieces were nice and thick and fresh. They also did NOT load it with stuff we didn't like. Some places put cucumbers and radishes for decoration to make it look a lot and they put octopus, scallops, or other types of seafood that may be cheaper but are not as tasty. Service is also very good. Great variety and lots of choices and combinations. The baked sushi rolls are excellent."}
{"text":"I drive all the way from Tempe to eat here. The volcano roll is very good. Fast and friendly service and good price"}
{"text":"Went here to try the local sushi joints in our area. Main Street does not get a lot of good business, so my wife and I thought we would take a chance and try out the sushi here. Needless to say, we were kind of disappointed. The sushi that was made fell apart very easily, which is the main reason why I am giving two stars. Also, the owner/sushi chef would smoke and then immediately come in and start making sushi. He \"washed\" his hands with water...."}
{"text":"This place is awesome... I have been coming here for years and I love it... you feel like family when your here and they have great sushi... also you get a lot for what you pay... Best sushi joint in the valley"}
{"text":"I love sushi... Not all of it and definitely not the premade kind. Having said that, there are not nearly as many good options for sushi in Gilbert, as I had hoped for... but this one is good! Eel is great. I like the AZ caterpillar and they do specials for half rolls if you're undecided. If you eat in - you get miso soup, salad, your entree and they bring you a little complimentary dessert with your check. Today I'm braving the take out, so I'll keep you posted on that one...  Bottom line - if you like sushi- that's a good place to get some :)"}
{"text":"This has been my go-to sushi place near my house for a few years now. I love that you can choose among many combinations of sushi and entrees, and the service is great. For 10 bucks, I walk out of there always feeling full. Every meal also comes with a small salad, miso soup, and of course the delicious dessert afterwards. The dessert is what makes the meal so awesome! It's basically an assortment of thinly cut fruit, whipped cream, chocolate syrup, and pocky sticks. YUM"}
{"text":"This place is definitely one of the best sushi places around here. The prices are great and the food is fresh! Soup, salad and a dessert are included with your food and everything is delicious.  Very authentic in my opinion. You can even get your picture taken and put up on the wall ;)"}
{"text":"Sushi was good. Not outstanding but good  enough, and the prices were not bad at all. I order one of the combos from the No.2 section, forgot the name, but it was good, I got full after eating a few pieces  which was surprising. As everyone else here says, they welcome you with miso soup and lettuce salad with a delightful dressing. I did not care for the dessert but I appreciated it. All in all, I would go back."}
{"text":"If you are a sushi lover, don't miss this place!! The servers are fast and friendly, if you like spicy make sure to try Red Dragon that's soooooo gooood"}
{"text":"Soooo glad I discovered this place! I'll admit, I was being lazy when I decided to eat here.  I was CRAVING sushi, but did not want to drive all the was to my regular spot 25 minutes away.  This place just happens to be right down the street. I also had my son (who is a 6-year-old sushi fiend) and sister with me, so I kind of took a chance on this place.  It did not disappoint!  We went and just happened to catch happy hour, which made it even better! Between the 3 of us, we have quite a few different rolls, including of course, my customary Vegas roll.  Delicious!  We had a great time here. Everything tasted amazing and the service was great!  Cannot say enough about this place. So happy to have a sushi spot in Gilbert!"}
{"text":"LOVE the Fact that they give you all the courses with the meal...soup, salad, meal, desert all included with whatever you order...Good scenery as well..."}
{"text":"Management has definitely changed, unfortunately for the worse - service is slow and unprofessional. Sushi quality has deteriorated and the kama (yellowtail collar) is bordering on questionable. Definitely more of an HH spot for good prices, but wouldn't come here for quality."}
{"text":"This is my go to sushi restaurant. Service is good and usually fast, sushi is wonderful and prices are excellent! They always have a happy hour or specials available to choose from and everything is delicious and fresh!   I love that they bring you salad and miso soup to start your meal and a fruit dessert at the end."}
{"text":"all i can say as a first time customer is wow!! this food is amazing!! so is the environment and music and the staff!!"}
{"text":"The best place to have sushi I drive all the way from Payson to get my sushi here! Great prices and people!"}
{"text":"We have been dining at Masa Sushi for over 4 years and it's still our favorite 'go to' sushi place. Not only do you find value but you find great service as well. The quality of food is fresh and the experience is wonderful and you even get to post your picture on the wall!!!! We own a vacation rental just down the street and we advertise Masa Sushi on our restaurant page. Because who we refer is a reflection of us. Great atmosphere for casual dining and you can't beat the price for the quality."}
{"text":"I think the address on Yelp is incorrect but the map is correct. It is located at Gilbert and Guadalupe, nearby Chevron, at the left end of a shopping complex. I'm Japanese so I can't say this is authentic, but the roll sushis are pretty good :) The fish is fresh and service is quick. The udon soup was not so good though... Went on Saturday night and there was a line outside when we left around 7pm."}
{"text":"I am never disappointed when I eat here! Even on a busy night the wait is never too long! The servers are pretty friendly. Good sushi for a great price!"}
{"text":"To quote Mr. Takei, \"Oh My!!!\" This place is great!! Friendly staff, really informative, just amazing. On top of that, the food is fantastic!! I may get a little carried away with all the exclamation marks, but damn!!! We found our local sushi hole!!!"}
{"text":"Had a very bad experience this evening, & it's sad because today was a special day & I felt like some having Sushi to celebrate.  We came in at exactly 5:00PM (the time they reopen for dinner). 1st the young lady that showed us to our table seemed a little she was tired & needed sleep, but even that was ok bc Masa Sushi lacks customer service, so we r used to that. We sat at the sushi bar and right infront of me there was a dead fly!  It was so gross, then the waitress came & when we told her she acted monotone & normal, & we told her we were not sitting there. The worst part of this ordeal was that it took forever for someone (a cook in the back) to take care of the fly! We ended up taking the order to go, the food is in the fridge $60+ of sushi I will not eat.  When I go to Masa Sushi I usually see a nice older gentleman behind the Sushi Bar, that greets us & is cordial, TODAY he wasn't there, so I guess this incident might be attributed to the YOUNGINGS RUNNING THE SHOW !"}
{"text":"I don't remember what roll I ordered bit it was a big pile of who knows what. It wouldn't have been so bad if it wasn't drenched with some sort of sauce that was over the top.  We came in kind of late but still enough time to eat but I felt like we were rushed by the staff."}
{"text":"Best place for lunch. for $8.95 you get soup,salad, large plate of your choice of rolls and a dessert. Service is great"}
{"text":"It was typical Chef's Choice Sashimi--nothing special! Sushiya allows replacements/substitutions and they are the only place that does!"}
{"text":"I came here and ordered dinner before picking up the kiddo... someone recommended that I come here. I always follow through with word-of-mouth recommendations!  Too bad I only got the order to go, but from the time that I was in there, it seemed like very nice decor, clean and not fishy smelling like some other places. They have good sake specials on the menu like my friend had said, but the chicken teriyaki dinners are almost $20 a piece? I understand it comes with miso soup and salad, (no california rolls included), but 20 bucks?? Seems a bit steep to me. As reluctant as I was, I ordered 2 chicken teriyaki dinners with 2 orders california rolls... $40+Tip.. owie. Atleast it was delicious.  Quality: A-  Value: C-  Friendliness of staff: A  Maybe I'd be singing a different note if I tried their happy hour.. til next time."}
{"text":"This place is amaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaazing, when I crave sushi my mouth waters and i instantly want Masa Sushi, the monkey Balls and stuffed jalapenos are great the sushi is all fresh, servers are so nice. The happy hour price is nice all day. Love Love love it"}
{"text":"Best sushi for the price!!!! We drive from North Phoenix because its so good and worth the drive. I leave there full not like other sushi places where I drop $100 and then get a burger!"}
{"text":"We love this place. We have been coming here for 3 years.  The Masa Maki roll is my favorite! Yum yum"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in after we found the original restaurant we were supposed to dine at was closed. When we arrived we were the only guests there. We were greeted and seated immediately, and shortly after we were brought miso soup and salad. I did not care for the soup or the salad. Thankfully it was free.   For lunch I ordered a bento box combo which included teriyaki chicken, tempura, a crunch roll, and a spicy tuna roll. It also included white rice with the chicken, plus a gyoza. The sushi was very fresh and delicious! I enjoyed the spicy tuna roll immensely. The crunch roll was very big and had a large amount of crab inside. The chicken teriyaki was also pretty good. As for the tempura, it was very greasy. I could taste grease above all else. I also found it interesting that one of the friend vegetables was an onion ring. I have not encountered that before.   I would return to this restaurant due to the prompt service and the delicious sushi. I would not order the tempura again. The prices here were very good. My bento box was $11, and I received a lot of food."}
{"text":"Great selection of food.  I usually have a hard time figuring out what I want here.  Absolutely delicious.  Love that they're only a block away.  A great alternative to hitting restaurant row in Gilbert.  We usually order take out.  Like others have said it's a basic sit down place with a couple TVs going but it's too cramped for me.  I like dining in the comfort of my home more."}
{"text":"The food was better than I expected. Asked for the chefs special (different everyday) and it was way above my expectations. Something I've never seen before at any other sushi restaurants. Server was extremely polite and did a great job. I'll definitely be back here with friends that have not tried here before."}
{"text":"This place is usually my go to place if I want sushi. It's good sushi at a good price. I always leave full and satisfied. They bring you miso soup and a salad before the sushi comes out. At the end of the meal they also serve you free dessert. The service is always good, the place is clean and the food is good. Damn, I think I might have to go tonight. Yum!"}
{"text":"Really good food. I always try different Japanese places and this one definitely ranks among my personal top 3 In terms of food quality. They have good sake so you can get pretty hammered while eating some good sushi. Friendly front of the house staff. Quality cooks. Menu is a trip, SO MUCH to chose from!"}
{"text":"Monkey balls earned them a 5 star rating. Hawaiian and rainbow rolls very fresh.  They have an extensive menu and we will be back to try more!"}
{"text":"Strip mall sushi elevated!  The staff is very friendly and attentive.  They start you off with a perfect bowl of miso and a small crisp salad with a thin dressing so tasty you will be tempted to drink it.   We ordered a combo that came with a large beer, a small sake and two rolls. Plus we added the shrimp and veggie tempura.  Everything was fresh and tasty with very generous portions.  The bill came to 23 dollars!  I was already impressed but the price makes this my favorite sushi place."}
{"text":"OK so my husband and I went to 4 different sushi places in the East Valley. And I am more than convinced that after eating at Masa sushi this is clearly the best choice to get sushi. The waitresses were very friendly there was more than enough space to eat and fresh fish and you can tell by the way it taste. Everything from the appetizers to the Boston role were amazing. My new favorite place. Sherry"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing sushi and well worth the money. Excellent customer service and sushi chefs. Vivian was our server and did a phenomenal job! Super interactive with the guest and showed great customer service. Happy we decided to stop here to eat today!"}
{"text":"Best sushi I've found in gilbert, I just wish the atmosphere was better. They have these fried jalapeños stuffed with ahi (I think) that are amazing. It does seem a bit expensive, but then again I always order waaaay too much. They also do take out which I find to be the better choice."}
{"text":"4 out of 5 times, Masa Sushi is our go to place, we like to experience different places, to add to our favorites, but Masa remains our favorite."}
{"text":"Great place! I love the sushi! They have great prices, they taste better than Raw, and they give fantastic service!"}
{"text":"Great prices, awesome fresh sushi and a surprise dessert at the end of the meal! We'll be back to Masa soon!"}
{"text":"Best sushi place I have ever been to, the sushi is great the Adam mommy is great that karaoke chicken is great the service is great I come back all the time"}
{"text":"This was one of the worst sushi restaurant experience in AZ. First they \"lost\" our dinner reservation, thus we had to wait for an open table. The waitress who took our reservation ignored us and seated others ahead of us. Second the service was super slow. They even forgot an order of additional sake. Three, the fish on the nigiri sushi was dry like chewing on a sponge with no taste( indication of old fish slices.) The only star they get is for cold beer with cold glasses. Not coming back here. ------- Three days later: To my surprise, I realized that they conveniently used my intended total amount I was going to charge for the bill as gratuity, more than doubling the dining bill. Although they insisted it was a clerical mistake, it was difficult to take. I am glad I caught their \"error\" in time. They refunded the excess amount after I showed them their original receipt."}
{"text":"Love the caterpillar roll here! This place has the freshest rolls and most high quality sushi around. My family's go to sushi place"}
{"text":"Worst sushi place ever! My vegetable rolls and cucumber rolls tasted horrible. It is the first time ever that I eat vegetable sushi that it is so bad, the vegetables were falling apart all the time. We wanted to try something new and we were very excited about this place. My husband didn't like the sushi either. He said \"I have eaten lots of great sushi at other places\". We are sushi lovers and we can't believe how bad sushi tastes here. We even almost didn't get refills. Unbelievable! He ordered eel sushi. He said his sauce didn't taste as it is supposed to be. He couldn't find good flavor on it.   Their menus doesn't mention the list of ingredients.  When you order, your sushi may have cream cheese on it and other surprise ingredients (we know other places add cream cheese as well).  I only like the patio! They have brooms and even cat's food on their patio."}
{"text":"We Love masa sushi! Super fresh and really reasonable prices! Great service as well! Every time we come in we leave satisfied with our food and service. They also make the rolls very fast! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is a matter of meeting expectations.  This is a good \"middle-of-the-road\" sushi place, and priced for exactly what they are so I was happy with that.  Service was friendly and good, and my food came fairly quickly even though they were jammed for lunch.  Quality of the sushi was average, but again it was priced for that level.  I'll be going back."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Masa Sushi for some years now, not often but I keep coming back.  Went back there this week and still enjoyed it.  Food is still good, service is great.  Happy people servicing you with always a friendly attitude. And unlike a lot of sushi places they're open for lunch. Not the greatest sushi but above the average."}
{"text":"I like to try new sushi restaurants. I dropped in to Masa on my lunch break and ordered the lunch special. Spicy tuna roll and California roll with Miso soup and salad. I know, nothing too exciting but I like to start with the basics at new places.   I was very impressed with the service and the quality of food I received. Everything tasted fresh. Value was incredible and I will definitely be back again and more adventurous next time."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that the sushi tastes fresh compared to other places in town. We enjoyed it for quite a while. However, I have had a hair stuck to my sushi twice, and it had to be remade on both occasions. The sushi chefs have some decently long hair, and usually aren't wearing hats to keep it in or anything. We were enjoying the happy hour specials for quite a while, but then we noticed that food was taking longer to receive ( the last time we waited an hour and almost left), the servers were becoming lazy, and we have even had one girl give us an attitude when we asked for some water...as if we were bothering her. We did like the place, but after our last bad experience there, we won't be going back.   I think the sushi chefs need to at least wear a hat. 2 hairs on two separate occasions, is two too many. I also think that they need to hire some more people to help, or more servers, and get rid of some of the little girls that don't understand the concept of working.  I would have given this establishment four stars if I had joined Yelp before out last several visits. We are honestly sad that the restaurant started to go downhill. It was our favorite sushi joint in Gilbert. One bad outing can happen, but several in a row isn't coincidence."}
{"text":"Masa is so deliciously authentic for being in the middle of the valley! Whenever I want sushi, I drive from Tempe all the way here because it's worth it. 10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"Love the sushi combo options here! Plenty of food for a great price. Good quality and service."}
{"text":"The service was awesome, no complains at all. They're very attentive, very accommodating & fast. But the food... the tempura was good, the sushi's not really.. the rice wasn't good, was too thick, just small amount of imitation crab meat, almost all their sushi's has cucumber in it, the quality of their fishes was't good either. we can't even finish our order because it really was not good."}
{"text":"I have never been to a sushi restaurant where I had to actually stop eating because the food was so gross. First time for everything.  The salmon nigiri was so tough that I couldn't bite it in half. It was almost rubbery. The other sushi plates (we had four in all) smelled very fishy mixed with the faint odor of cleaning fluid.  The fried rolls tasted like they had been cooked in very old oil.  The prices were extremely reasonable, and the restaurant itself was decent in terms of tone and decor. I liked that they gave you complimentary miso and salad, although I didn't care for the salad dressing.  In all, definitely a place I will never return to again."}
{"text":"Sushi was okay...nothing impressive, and didn't really feel like the price was worth it.  Menus are a mess, with no organization whatsoever.  Service was terrible - couldn't hardly get a drink refill, and my second sushi order took forever for a simple roll and nigiri."}
{"text":"Right when you sit down you get a free miso and a salad, then at the end you get a dessert-bonus.   They have happy hour everyday at any time-another bonus.   The portion of food you get for the money you pay is also pretty nice. I like the monkey brains, jalapeño poppers, Las Vegas roll, and their regular sashimi (octopus, salmon, squid). Some places their rice or the actual seafood is dry, but not here.   The service is horrible, very difficult to get the waitress attention, we have been here multiple times with the same service. This definitely drops them down a star."}
{"text":"Great deals and great food. Definitely recommend going here when you're in Gilbert. The happy hour special is all day and the deals on it are very good"}
{"text":"The sushi is ok. I was expecting a bit more given the rating in terms of quality and presentation. Lots of dishes w/cream cheese. Very Americanized imo."}
{"text":"When I walked I thought it was closed, no customers.  I thought I'll give it a try... not bad.  Server was attentive. Food is above good, one of the better revolving sushi places I been to.  If you like all you can eat it's here!!"}
{"text":"Best miso soup and salad dressing I've found in the valley thus far. Menu could use a little more variety, but overall the food is good, fresh, and service is quick.  One of my favorite Sushi places in the East Valley."}
{"text":"First off, the cooks greet you when you enter and leave the restaurant, which was odd at first, but very welcoming.  They start you off with soup and salad, which are very good.  The sushi is ok, and the prices are pretty decent.  After the meal, they provide you with a fruit dessert, which is tasty!  Overall a nice place to eat with really good customer service."}
{"text":"YES! I'm a fan.  You can throw a rock and hit a sushi restaurant anywhere in Gilbert, but I have to say I like this place the best. Attentive staff, great food and cheap. I opted for the Bulgoki beef and a couple of rolls tonight. The beef is so good, after I got mine, other people ordered it at my table!  The stuffed jalapeno's are freeking awesome too. Great job, we'll always be back!!"}
{"text":"Been to both locations multiple times. Awesome sushi, and service has always been great at both locations. Come here if you want to avoid the below average food at Kona. You won't regret it and the Monkey Balls are actually so good, try them! ;)."}
{"text":"They have happy hour all day, everyday. Their rolls are massive. We always leave stuffed. There are so many things to choose from its hard to decide. I love the fact that they offer half & half combinations (4 piece of each type to make one roll) for people like me that love variety.   One of the best dynamite rolls around. It's a must order every time I go.   This has been our go to sushi spot lately.   Side salad & miso soup included w every meal. And some fruit dessert to finish every meal, free!"}
{"text":"MY FAVORITE SUSHI OF ALL TIME!  I'm a regular and have been coming here for years. It's better than the sushi that I've had in Asia that was fresh out of a gutted tuna fish."}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I were looking for an affordable yet yummy sushi spot after our workout & we Yelped this place ! Super yummy , clean & friendly staff !"}
{"text":"Came here on a whim for lunch and was pleasantly surprised!! This place is cute and a little funky, lots of signage and things everywhere. Definitely a more laid back fun environment. The server was great and quick even though she was the only server and had a bunch of tables. I ordered the red dragon + crunch roll and my daughter the kids teriyaki chicken for 3 dollars. We were brought out complimentary miso soup and salad. The sushi was 8 pieces but u left so full. It was delicious. My favorite part was the spicy tuna. They brought my 4 year olds meal out on a kitty plate and the representation was so cute she ate the entire thing. If you know anything about young kids, it's hard to get them to do that. This place was somewhat busy and had lots of families and coworkers on business lunch, so it's essentially great for everyone.  At the end we got an adorable little orange, whipped cream, chocolate stick boat with our check. If you're looking for fun, cheap, laid back yummy food this is the place. If you're into more fancy, stuffy, expensive sushi places this might not be the place for you. We loved it though!"}
{"text":"Great place, menu is huge and has pictures   Happy hour offers some amazing combos  I think this Gilbert Gem will take off as more people stop by on the way to downtown"}
{"text":"We arrived just before continuous groups came to fill up the restaurant. First off we got half a bowl of barely warm miso soup and a small plate of iceberg lettuce. I ate the chicken teriyaki bowl containing what the waiter said would be steamed carrots, broccoli & cabbage be t only the cabbage was cooked. The generous portion of chicken was good with better teriyaki sauce than usual."}
{"text":"I haven't been back in awhile, however upon my return this has really gone downhill.  We ordered yellowtail that was pink with a brown surrounding and when I put in my mouth it tasted like the most fishy scummy lake in the south.  All sushi was horrific, warm or hot, and definitely not fresh.  Service was close to none as we also bussed our own table which was the sushi bar, pathetic right?  If you want to get sick or nauseous, this is your place, otherwise, go elsewhere.  Really and seriously this is a very nasty place now.  Can we say, \"save money\"?  Negative review----"}
{"text":"So glad I had the opportunity to try this restaurant! Great selection of sushi and entrees. Upon entering, we were immediately greeted & seated. Our server Jasmine and staff were very attentive and respectful. Although the service was GREAT but the food was mediocre. It all started with the appetizers, calamari was refried to hell and back. The salads that comes with the meal had ice forming. The biggest disappointment was the sushi. It seem like I was eating a prepackaged sushi from Fry's. I also ordered a \"yellow tail\" roll that was funky. Never again."}
{"text":"Best Miso soup! You have to try the Popcorn Lobster and Stuffed Jalapeño! Sometimes a bit slow but always worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this place since it opened . It has always been a pleasure and a great time. This is family owned and it is by far the best in town . I have been to about 25 places and this out scores all nothing close for the price and art of sushi. the wait staff is great and very attentive. the presentation is excellent and if you ask for a special thing they are happy to do it for you . this is a must try and i assure you you wont go any place else . thanks to the Masa family."}
{"text":"Great selection of rolls and very tasty!!! Great saki.  Awesome service. Nice atmosphere. Finally, quite possibley the best Ahi tataki I've EVER had!!! If you love Ahi then get it while you can and make sure you get it here!"}
{"text":"Took my son here for an Easter treat. We both love sushi and this was as good as any we've had. I'm not well versed in the culinary experience of sushi to write anything poetic and moving, but we were very pleased with our meal here.  They have an enormous selection, which can be overwhelming to decide upon something perhaps? We went with one of the selections where you get sashimi/nigiri/rolls. We were both stuffed for $40.  Great price for the amount of food and excellent quality. I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Since I moved here from San Francisco this has been my place to go for sushi. Its 20 minutes away and I'll travel it anytime for this sushi.   The sushi is always very fresh tasting and the sashimi slices are meaty and delicious. Your meal always comes with a bowl of miso soup (which is very flavorful) and a iceburg lettuce salad (the dressing is amazing). I have ordered rolls and dinner boxes and am never disappointed. The Edamame and shrimp and veggie tempura are favorites that are on the happy hour special. The chirashi sushi bowl is one of my favorites for sashimi (12 pieces of fish for 15.00, very affordable!). You always get a complimentary dessert too, for lunch its half an orange and for dinner its an orange with an apple fan and caramel sauce (super numnums)   Service is usually very good, sometimes the servers get a little busy as there is usually only two for the whole restaurant which can get really busy.   When I move again this is going to be one of the places I'll miss the most. Even in SF I didn't have a sushi place I enjoyed this much. Definitely try it out!  New discovery- they have gluten free soy sauce if you ask for it!"}
{"text":"Great Sushi at a great price. Always very friendly service too. Love all the pictures on the wall. Fun atmosphere without being too loud that you can't share with others. Always my go-to sushi place when I have guest."}
{"text":"Was here today for lunch.  All the way from NYC, :D Such an amazing atmosphere and more importantly FOODS!! Simply AWESOME!!  I am definitely coming back again on my next trip."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for sushi for years and love it!  We tend to go to Chandler but now think the sushi chef is better in Gilbert. The rolls are bigger here. We have tried other places but we keep coming back. Love Masa Sushi!"}
{"text":"Masa Sushi never disappoints! Always on point.. Great service and really nice staff.  Will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Just an update... Masa every time we go takes great care of us and gives us a great Japanese experience. Sushi is fantastic. Teriyaki is great. Soba is perfect.   Everything here is done well and the bill is ALWAYS a pleasant surprise. What a great value and experience. We always have a good time here."}
{"text":"Went here on a whim, it was the only place open. The atmosphere over all was a bit different than most sushi restaurants that I have been to, it was very loudly decorated. The waitress brought out miso soup and a small salad almost as soon as we sat down, which I loved. The waitress was very attentive and accommodating. The sushi was not cheap..but it never is, is it? We ordered the Boston roll-it was good. Definitely the first time I have ever seen melted cheese on top of sushi. It was an interesting twist, but it was good. We also go the spicy & spicy roll, which was delicious. It was not overly spicy, so of course I added a large amount of wasabi. We also got the fresh yellowtail roll. I love raw fish, so I loved it. The last one we got was called the midnight roll. It had a weird flavor that I did not care for, but my boyfriend seemed to like it. Lastly, the \"free desert\" was half a sliced apple and half of an orange with whipped cream, caramel sauce drizzled on the top and two chocolate sticks. It was light and refreshing, but still sweet. Overall, I enjoyed my visit. I will most likely eat there again."}
{"text":"Compared to what I've found in the EV and the rest of Phoenix this place gets 5 stars.  Compared to some of the best 4 stars.    Finally a sushi place that has a great selection of delicious rolls at a decent price and well priced drinks.   It's not hard core sushi, but it's flavorful.  Staff is usually courteous and quick.  Been here 6 times, just one time the service was not quite up to par.    So if you're looking for good food, come here. You'll be pleasantly surprised.  A lot better then Ra"}
{"text":"This place is always good and always consistent. Excellent all-day happy hours, great rolls. They are very accommodating and will usually make you whatever you ask for. My only real complaint has nothing to do with the food - it's the music they play. I'm probably what you would call a senior citizen and I eat here at least once a week. The music is toooo loud for my ears, too harsh and too much for my wife and me. But we STILL eat here all the time because the service and the food is excellent. I'd give it five stars if they play softer and nicer music!"}
{"text":"When I lived in AZ I would eat here all the time. My last visit (last year) was the deal breaker for me and made it the very last visit my boyfriend and I would ever make to this place. The final visit included a long wait to be seated (there was maybe only 3 couples dining at the time we went), starters which included barely lukewarm miso soup, and less than half a bowl of salad, and a very long wait for our food. It is not so much that the food is bad. If you want extremely Americanized \"sushi\" then by all means, come to this place. The food is fairly fresh so I won't complain there.   My biggest complaint above all is the ridiculous customer service you will experience here. I cannot vouch for the cooks, but the waitresses have zero experience in talking and dealing with customers. I was treated so rudely when I ordered for my boyfriend (he was busy on his phone when I ordered for the two of us). Jennifer/Jessica (it was one or the other) responds by saying \"Oh, so you're ordering for HIM??\" as she pointed. Doesn't sound bad in a normal sense, but if I only could've recorded the sass and tone in her voice. After taking our orders and being given our food, she didn't say a single thing to us, not even coming by once for water or a simple, \"How is everything?\".   Having being one with customer service skills and decency despite her attitude, we paid for our meal and were on our way. Oh! Not to mention that as we were leaving, my boyfriend nearly slipped and fell on a wet surface they didn't clean up and not a single person working asked if he was okay. But another customer who also nearly fell was asked right away if she was okay. Interesting, interesting.   I had the decency to tip this girl too, though she deserved none, and I regret doing that. I left the restaurant feeling like I did something bad, with how she talked to me when I ordered for my boyfriend. I felt embarrassed, even though I had no reason to feel this way. Overall, her attitude made me feel really bad, and I don't want to support a place with employees like this. I have never returned, and never plan to. I hope you hire employees with better PR skills soon, Masa Sushi, because from reading other reviews on here, it looks like I'm not the only one with this concern and complaint. :/"}
{"text":"What a cute place! Adorned in customer pictures, Japanese umbrellas, and a snazzy paint job, this place channels a more hip alternative vibe for Japanese food. The menu is pretty extensive, and includes various sushi and bento combos - it takes a bit to go through it all. They start you off with the traditional miso and salad.  There's six gyoza in an order. Three vegetable (green) and three pork (?). Not too bad, but I burnt the crap of my tongue: patience is a must.   The sushi was amazing. I grabbed the chirashi, which is a bowl filled with rice and sashimi. The quality of the salmon was UNREAL. Like butter going down your throat. It was the absolute star of the bowl.   Service was great. Amazing atmosphere, amazing sushi. Would love to frequent this place if I lived here."}
{"text":"i love masa! the place is smaller with the only downfall is having weird hours. were always automatically greeted when me and my boyfriend go there.  i am a huge sushi fan however my boyfriend isnt. but at masa he loves the chicken and steak yakisoba and there are also plenty of fried and cooked rolls he can also eat as well. i personally always get the monkey balls which is a horrible name for the food but its amazing. there deep fried mushrooms that are filled with creamcheese and crab mix. i am also a big fan of there popcorn lobster and there dynamite roll. yummmmy. the food is incredible and the price is relatively cheap for sushi. i love this place :)    ps they give complmentary miso soup and salad right upon arival and a complimentary light fruit dessert with whip cream as an added bonus"}
{"text":"This place was very good! Service was quick and sushi was very yummy. Happy hour is the perfect time to come to save money. Good place  for families, not a club setting like RA. I WILL BE BACK FOR SURE!"}
{"text":"Great place! We get sushi from here every Sunday and it's always wonderful. Quick, friendly people too."}
{"text":"I can't remember what I ordered, but it was awesome! I loved that the rolls weren't packed with rice like some places. I will definitely be returning! Disappointed that I didn't try this spot sooner."}
{"text":"Our neighborhood favorite sushi restaurant! You definitely won't go hungry with miso soup, fresh garden salad and happy hour menu all day. Definitely try the stuffed jalapeños! Oh and don't forget to stay for their complimentary dessert. Quick and friendly service!"}
{"text":"I come to this place all the damn time. They're consistently good. They've got some sweet bento boxes for lunch and awesome half roll combos for good prices."}
{"text":"I have been to Masa sushi several times for lunch and I have enjoyed every visit.  The service is efficient and friendly without being over-bearing.  Empty bowls are taken quickly and drinks are promptly refilled.  Even when I have come with a large party from work, they do a great job at serving everyone in a timely manner.  The bento boxes are a great deal at $7.99; you can select from several different combinations of sushi, rolls, teriyaki, tempura, etc plus soup and a small salad.  The menu is quite extensive so I can't imagine anyone would be unable to find a dish to their liking.  Even non-sushi fans are given several options.  One of these days I'm going to try the happy hour which features an extensive list of discounted food & drinks.  I'm sure it will be stellar!  See you there!"}
{"text":"Sushi was alright. Wasn't the best but it was decent. The pricing was not too bad but not too great either. The atmosphere was nice and cute. Though, the service was just ok. They aren't really personable. They were more like hi what u want , ok here you go, ok bye. lol. But overall it is okay and I would go back again."}
{"text":"Prices are reasonable.  What I got did not match the description though.  The roll I ordered said \"very spicy\" and this wasn't spicy at all.  I did not like this weird white sauce poured over my rolls either.   I did taste some of what my friend ordered and it was delicious.  I'll definitely be back, but I will be a bit more cautious of what I am being served."}
{"text":"Came for lunch, ordered the salmon love combo. They have a pretty large menu with a lot of combos and happy hour deals. Service was great but the sushi just didn't taste good to me. Meh!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Everyone is super welcoming and the owner Ms Lee is amazing she goes above and beyond to make you feel welcome. The food is delicious. Must try the popcorn lobster!!! Definitely 5 stars!!!!"}
{"text":"This is still my favorite sushi place in the East Valley.  The service is good (sometimes a little slow but I enjoy visiting with friends while we wait). I've been coming for several years now & have always been very pleased with the experience."}
{"text":"THE BEST sushi I have had in a very long time..... being from California, I'm super snobby with my sushi...this pace looks like a total hole in the wall from the outside, but the food is amazing! The fish is fresh, and melts in your mouth, the rolls are enormous, even the cooked items are great! My toddler is super picky about what he eats, and usually never eats teriyaki bowls when we order for him, but from here, he couldn't have enough. We eat here a few times a month."}
{"text":"We've FINALLY found a go-to sushi place in our area...praise the Lawd! Great happy hour specials...that actually last till a decent hour.  I feel like we order a ton and it doesn't break the bank.  My husband thinks they have the best tempura..I'm also a fan of the red dragon roll. Plus free appetizer salad, miso soup and refreshing fruit dessert...will make this a weekly habit :)"}
{"text":"The sashimi was really good but wilted lettuce soggy edamame and soup that tastes like old socks. Very impersonal service."}
{"text":"My son had the sushi and loved it. I had teriyaki chicken and it was fantastic. Miso soup was the best I ever had. Good service too!"}
{"text":"This is my neighborhood go-to Sushi place. Having lived in Japan, I love good sushi and yet I can't always afford it in town. I can afford to go here on occasion, and I believe you get slightly better than what you pay for. This isn't the place for that special once a year sushi night out. This is the place to go if you can't afford the  upscale sushi that you would prefer, but have high enough standards that you won't stoop so low as to eat the supermarket sushi at Fry's. This is also a fantastic place to take kids, whether it's just to introduce them to sushi or if they are savvy enough to choose sushi over Chick-Fil-A  One thing I really like about the place is their \"Happy Hour\" pricing all day long. These particular specials allow you to order  two variety or rolls in one, for example my kids love the California roll/Spicy Tuna Roll combo. The get 4 of each, which is plenty for my kids and it then allows me to select my own specialty roll, or some other roll that I want them to try. This is is great place to experiment for the uninitiated.   You get miso soup, salad and a cool free dessert of whipped cream, oranges and Pocky sticks (also a hit with the kids).  You're not going to get the authentic Japanese experience complete with the shouts of \"Irashaimasen!\" when you walk in, but it's authentic enough for what they charge.  Side note: I once accidentally left my ID here while eating alone. Must have fallen out of my wallet when I paid. Couldn't find it anywhere. Weeks later, I went back in and the waitress recognized me and brought it to me. THAT. WAS. AWESOME!  (But I also wondered why no one took the initiative to mail it to me. What if I never went back?)"}
{"text":"You are probably wondering how I could go from a 5 star rating to a 1 right???  Let me tell you this visit the night before valentines day  is one that definitely will NOT be forgotten and the one place that we thought we had found a hidden gem with amazing deals and awesome happy hour specials has completely diminished into a place we will NEVER go back too.  I cannot tell you how long my boyfriend moaned and complained about how pissed off he was about the service and how they over charged us for things that we never received/ordered.  I understand these people wanted to go home but this was a decent size table making at least $400 in food and drink orders so we were kind of hoping that our service would be at least average, but since gratuity was already added she probably didn't give a rats A** about how well of a job she was doing to say the least.  With that being said we hoped that something to be on point with service like drinks when we asked for them and not having to ask if we would be receiving them at some point. We also ordered saki bombs and the girl brought out the wrong shot glasses and my boyfriend likes to drop in his bomb doing it the way its supposed to be done.  With the wrong glass and shot glass the beer cup chipped. Not our fault the owner hired a dim wit of a waitress who doesn't pay attention to what people ordered the other girl had to explain what we ordered and how we wanted it(when she wasn't there to take the order to begin with)and it was not that difficult if you take the time to write it down correctly it would make perfect sense.  When we tried to explain to the girl that brought out our sushi that we did not get what we asked for and did not want what they brought us the guy behind the sushi bar was yelling in japanese like it was our fault they cannot understand a simple order. I hope to god that is not the owner because if it was their business will run itself into a hole real fast.  When I come to think of it every time we have gone the service has never ever been stellar. Maybe average-mediocre at most but well? Never. Since we sat inside for once we thought it might have been even better. Boy was i wrong!! absolutely horrible.  The girls were nice but just insanely stupid....to put it as nice as possible.     400 dollar table= we expected a mediocre night as far as service and not be completely over charged. 2 people that ordered 4 saki bombs usually is 15 dollars tops(because of the \"amazing\" happy hour deals. Yesterday was $28. we ordered 3 different sushi plates...so the most it should have been would be 40-50 with tip not 75! NEVER AGAIN RUINED MY DAMN VALENTINES DAY! UGH!!@!!   I hope the owner reads this and hires people who know how to take an order correctly and don't have argumentative sushi chefs.    WORST NIGHT EVER....I will miss the jalapeno monkey balls but i will not miss the Horrrrrid service. So definitely the worst spot you can go to with more than a couple friends."}
{"text":"It's a really cute place! The prices aren't that bad too! The combos are really nice to share and can fill a small group. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Masa is a place I can enjoy some delicious sushi and that is a rarity in Arizona. The overall atmosphere is enjoyable and I feel like I can experience my tasty cuisine and have fun with the company I bring along."}
{"text":"first and foremost,  the staff is amazing!  the food is pretty *blah* with little flavor. the yellowtail plate tastes like the fish is washed to nothing. The lobster fritters are greasy piles of sweet dough and the California roll is served underneath gathering grease. This coupled with the music playing on that sounds like PC speakers and the sticky swamp cooler feel to the air was all we could take. We politely paid our bill, tipped 20% to the wonderful staff, and left. Perhaps this good sushi to some, but it ranks low IMHO.  again,"}
{"text":"oh man! This is my Jam for sushi! Hands down! the service is typically good but if its a busy night bring your patience. but in regards to food, the amount, the cost & the presentation-impressive!"}
{"text":"Great sushi. Great service. Great prices. Strongly recommend if you want good sushi (almost impossible to find in AZ)."}
{"text":"All sushi are created equal. Sushi is sushi, no matter who makes it. A type of sushi tastes the same, no matter which sushi bar or restaurant makes them.  No, no and no. Where do people get these ideas? Who makes up these misleading and deceptive lies?!?  Ok, I love the variations that individual sushi places bring to sushi. Not so much the nigiri-style sushi but the rolls or the maki-style sushi. Sure, there are standards like the oh-so droll California roll, the philadelphia roll and things like the caterpillar, dragon and rainbow roll. Most of these sushi places are individual stores that either act alone or have a branch or two in a metropolitan area, so there's a lot of leeway or allowance to develop your own signature maki or sushi rolls.  Ok, enough with the lesson, but it's a setup. Don't scold me. This place rocks! Check out the bento meals, you get a bunch of stuff like fried rice, sushi roll pieces and bulgoki, a korean style sweet tangy beef BBQ. I got the Hot Sun Roll: crabmeat, cream cheese, cucumber and shrimp tempura on the inside; baked salmon on the outside. Be careful! It's hot (but not spicy). I got 2 pieces of tamago and unagi a la carte; they're my faves. My friend and I shared hot sake. That was a perfect compliment to our meal. After all that, before I got too full, I had to give up and say, I'm ready for dessert!  Then came the dessert. That was the surprise. Thin apple slices arranged into a fan with Pocky sticking out of the ice cream that supported it. An orange \"bowl\" with toothpicks to pick up the slices. A work of art that's edible. I think they serve it after every meal.  Food: B+ Value: A- (esp the bento meals, either lunch or dinner) Service: A (friendly, with a lot of smiles and prompt) Variety: A+ (check out the menu, the variety alone will overwhelm you)  When all that's said and done, this place is tops. If you're in the area (and I'm saddened that I'm from out of town), this place is a Must Try. Go! I mean now!"}
{"text":"I like their salmon sushi. Fish tastes delicious and full of fish. Today ordered a salad + 5 pieces of salmon sashimi + 4 pieces of octopus + 1 piece of squid sushi. If there is only one person like me, I can't order a salad because they have a salad and a bowl of soup. The soup may be a bit salty for me but it's not bad."}
{"text":"LOVE this little Sushi Bar!!!  My husband and I come here with our 2 kids all the time.  The staff is extremely friendly and no one minds the kids.... Granted, our kids are huge sushi fans, they both know their way around the menu, and can use their chopsticks, plus they eat everything!!!  They are pretty well behaved, too.  Masa gives you the best in a meal, as soon as you are seated you are greeted with hot miso soup and a salad that has the most fantastic dressing ever!!  The edemame is always hot and salted, the sashimi is always fresh and the rolls are fantastic. Don't forget about the AMAZING dessert they serve after your meal!!!  Masa has awesome lunch and happy hour specials too!!!  I just can't say enough about this wonderful little sushi bar!!!"}
{"text":"This place is my go to spot for sushi..I always get Kama as well. It is decadent and is huge compared to other places. They raise their price recently but for good food I can compromise. The service could be a lot better, they are slow and barely acknowledge their customers."}
{"text":"Found this great new sushi joint less that 5 mins from our new place. We shared a Happy hour combo for two people under $20. It came with 4 pieces of nigri 2salmon, 2 tuna, with choice of rainbow rolls( spicy or not). The meal came with miso soup, salad, and a fresh fruit dessert! The sushi was really fresh, and well proportioned for the price. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Atmosphere was really cute, and inviting. Variety of the fresh raw selections ( my fave) but also some fried rolls and non-sushi options. No kids menu but my mom toddler enjoyed a four piece Cali roll. And I usually dont review bathrooms, but the ladies room was impressively clean, and smelled really good lol. Overall great experience, favorite sushi I've tried since moving to Gilbert."}
{"text":"I love this place!  It is a relaxed atmosphere, the food is great, and you get a yummy dessert with your meal."}
{"text":"We absolutely LOVE Masa! My husband and I have been coming here for years and it NEVER disappoints! I'm not a huge fish person but my husband is and this is his favorite! But for me their chicken teriyaki is bomb! And basically everything else on the menu!"}
{"text":"This is our go to sushi place! If you like delicious sushi, lots of choices, fantastic service, and great prices, this place is for you!"}
{"text":"Another Great sushi night for the third timeI'm in the area for a few more weeks and I'll be back!  We visit this place every time we come down to see our daughter and grand kids.  A free edamame for a past review and anyone who provide a Yelp review will get the same!  A Monster roll and an Arizona Catapiler were the choices tonight along with our staple Saki bomb to make it a well rounded evening!"}
{"text":"It's not easy finding high quality sushi in a desert. I've been to plenty of sushi restaurants in the valley and Masa delivers the best sushi. The food is consistently fresh and delicious and the service is speedy and friendly. The soup, salad, and dessert is a nice touch as well. I'm so glad this place hasn't changed over the years!"}
{"text":"The best  sushi place! Fresh food, so yami! This place are favored! I recommend to visit, you will love it ."}
{"text":"I'm not going to address the food I had today at lunch, but rather my experience here...  The folks from work had been raving about this place all week and said that we're going here today for lunch.  There were roughly 12 of us, and they brought the food out to us as it was ready...usually 1-2 lunches at a time.  My lunch was the last one to come out, and when the server set it in front of me, I didn't think it looked right.  I told her that I didn't think that this was what I ordered.  She looked around the table and realized that another person had my lunch.  Even though he had started eating the lunch I ordered, she flat-out said for us to just switch plates and for me to pull off his plate what he had eaten off of mine.  I thought she was joking at first...but, she wasn't.  So, we actually swapped lunches, instead of them bringing me a new and correct lunch.  The other guy only ate a piece or two of sushi off my plate with his chopsticks and didn't touch the other stuff, but I still find this gross and unacceptable to swap lunches.  I really should have gotten up and walked out...needless to say, I will not be returning here."}
{"text":"This place has delicious food, nice, fast service and great prices!  I'm impressed.  I'm Asian and pretty fussy about my asian dishes. There's a sushi bar plus a couple tvs for viewing."}
{"text":"This sushi restaurant has always been consistently delicious! It is affordable, there's countless choices, and the employees are very hospitable! I recommend this place to anyone who loves sushi!"}
{"text":"Sushi is delicious and the choices are outstanding! The decisions so hard because everything on the menu looks great and they have all day happy hour Fri-Sat..... The combos on the happy hour menu were such big portions and they are really well priced. We decided to share two different combos, Sonoran and pacific combos and they are just really unique! I have eaten a lot of sushi and this place is a must try.."}
{"text":"The food was full of flavor, good size portions and reasonable price. They also serve a small salad and soup once you sit down and provide a free fruit dessert. I can't wait to come back again."}
{"text":"I found great reviews on yelp so I decided to try this out. I could not be more impressed. The service was great!  Everyone was so nice and the food was amazing. The prices were just as good!  Happy hour all day every day. I have always been very picky with my sushi but I have found my new go to place. Not too loud or crowded. Love it!"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi restaurant. Great atmosphere during the day and night! Happy hour prices."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years and believe they have the best sushi deals in Gilbert! Delicious high quality fish!"}
{"text":"Food was good, and service good as well. I have friend and she cannot eat cheese, somehow they made a mistake putting cream cheese in one off the rolls that we ordered, even we already told them put cheese on the side. But at the end, they recognized and brought us another one. Will be back soon ."}
{"text":"This place is great and took a large reservation.  The rolls, tempura, sashimi, sauced meats and dessert were pretty good.  This place is solid when you're craving some Korean style Japanese food (think rolls with lots of rice and calorific sauce) or some clean sashimi."}
{"text":"I love this place so much I almost wanted to give it a bad review so people wouldn't go. I love the fact that you can half half rolls (4pieces California 4 pieces spicy tuna) instead of having to choose one roll or have to find rolls everyone can share . The only thing I dislike is they changed their dessert so you don't get pocky sticks anymore.  The salad dressing they serve my friend described \"I would bath in this\". For the non sushi fans they have bento boxes with is a few small portions of meat rice sides of your choosing.  Ths service is always great quick and they are willing to explain any of the rolls to you."}
{"text":"Oh Masa, my love, my favorite restaurant in all of Phoenix.  What amazing sushi. Love sushi. Could eat sushi everyday.   You must order the number 33 off the happy hour menu; it's seriously amazing. And the monkey balls. One because they are fun to tell someone you would like some monkey balls, and two they are ridiculously good.  I can't tell you how much I love this place, but I'm pretty sure I paid their electric bill last month. My photo is on the wall with my honey, so that always makes me smile too. Can't go wrong with this delish place."}
{"text":"Very casual and has a comfortable and warm vibe! Serves miso soup with tofu,, unlike Ah-So. The servers are also very friendly and diverse. The wall art is very sentimental and the sushi tastes great! I've gone at least 3 times a month. The music choice is nice,, but could use work. Also you get free edamame by just writing a review!! Excellent."}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorate Sushi place they have lots of options . The prices are great and so are the portions . My go to place for good sushi plus the fast and friendly service is a PLUS !"}
{"text":"Not sure what all the fuss is about, I went in a few years back, I was turned off, and i don't know why.  People and yelp suggested it as good, not far from me, so I went, and when I got there I said UT OH! went in anyway maybe they had different owners? well thats what I told myself. Long story short, it is one of the worst, in service , not friendly , make a paying costomer that wants sushi not fried food with eel sauce  feeling unwelcome, sushi bar \"dude\" had no clue what sushi was! ( I am serious) I was willing to pay extra, and they obviously don't want to be nice, or care! basically I was ignored, told it's expensive to get yellow tail belly, I said okay I am willing to pay , then they put this horrible little dish in front of me with the skin still on the yellow tail, I didn't eat it, and I walked out leaving a 5 dollar bill for the miso soup I ate. EWWW imagine how I tip if i am treated like a human being!   My best advise is maybe if you like garbage fried food with eel sauce on it, this is your place. it is not for real sashimi/ sushi. nuff said... zero stars should be an option."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite sushi go to. I live in downtown Phoenix and will always make the drive to come to this location on Gilbert. They have never disappointed. Also the prices are perfect. I would recommend you try the Boston roll if you have never been here"}
{"text":"Been here several times now and I've gotta say the Korean run sushi places here in Arizona are pretty good. Weekend evenings are pretty busy here so it's a good idea to visit during lunch or a weekday. The service is pretty good when they aren't packed to the doors.  The sushi is reasonably priced and they have their mixed menu which I like since I can pick more than one thing and still not be paying more than I want. And even though it's a mix and match, the portions are a good size. Just take a look at the picture I added and you'll see. Good food.  The 2 awesome things about this place though have got to be the free dessert and the pictures on the wall. If you read through other's reviews, you'll find others who talk about it. Basically apples, oranges, pocky sticks, and chocolate drizzle. If you're celebrating any kind of occasion they'll let you take a Polaroid picture and put it on their wall!"}
{"text":"As always great food and great service.  The sushi chef always makes beautiful art pieces.  Today I ordered Kama and Chirashi. Awesome and fresh as usual."}
{"text":"What a great family experience! Fantastic sushi at a reasonable price. We ordered the Hot Arizona, Spicy Tuna Spicy, Crunchy California, and the Red Dragon. They came out in good time and presentation. The highlight of our visit was the treatment our three year old son received. Our server finished my sentence as I asked for juice being watered down for him, brought his food out first and on a child's plate complete with snowman characters on it, and dessert on the house. He was treated extra sweetly and as a welcomed patron. Thanks so much for making him feel so special!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Consistently always really good. High quality product, good atmosphere and staff that always helps menu guide you to the best items you want. My fav is the Sashimi Platter w Saki Bomber."}
{"text":"I am a sushi FANATIC! I really LOVE great sushi!  I've eaten sushi all over the US. I've been going to Masa Sushi for about 2 years now. I think its a pretty decent sushi place given the price.  It's not top of the line sushi, but the prices are very decent. That being said, I do think the economy has hit this business hard.   The last time my wife and I went there the sushi was not as fresh as we were used to, so my guess is the owner had to make some tough decisions and perhaps lowered the quality of the sushi until business picks back up.   That being said, I would go there again and plan to, but keep your expectations in line. You get a lot for the money, but it's not $50pp sushi either."}
{"text":"Eh.. I've had better. We almost went to House Sushi but thought we could try something new. Should've went to House Sushi."}
{"text":"We had time to kill waiting for tests from a local vet, so we ventured out in search of something.  Neither of us like sushi, but we like teriyaki, so we saw this place on the corner and gave it a try.  What an unexpected surprise!!  Great service, and little touches that came with our order that we didn't expect.  Excellent tofu soup and a little salad, and an after-dinner dessert, plus an excellent chicken teriyaki, all reasonably priced.  We would (and WILL) definitely return the next time we are in this area."}
{"text":"First time here I wasn't sure what to expect. They were fairly busy for only having one server but other than that this place was great.  I was surprised when the server brought a little salad and miso soup before my sushi as I didn't realize it came with it. The sushi was amazing but I felt like the pieces were a little too big.  At the end of the meal the server brought a fancy half orange pre sliced with whip cream and Carmel drizzled over the top.  I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"It's my \"go to\" place for yummy sushi on a rush day or any casual day.    The place is not fancy but they have put attention to their food!  Sushi is comparable to any upscale sushi place in town for half the money.   lots of choices and variety to choose from.  The servers are very helpful to show you around their large menu selection.    Come and hang out with good friends and enjoy great sushi."}
{"text":"TL;DR: Service is good, sushi tastes weird, smells fishy.   Went here last night craving sushi and wanting to try something new. The staff and service was good, the sushi was not. I would literally rather get sushi from the grocery store. I ordered the Alaskan combo and I can't say that any part of it was good. One roll was too sweet, the other had too much cream cheese making the consistency really mushy and gross. I returned it ultimately because a big chunk of skin was left on the salmon. I've never had such a strange combination before. A few other things we ordered were also really fishy smelling/tasting (like the Escobar). The only good one was the Lion King roll.   The front staff was nice and they reimbursed about half my order which was nice. They even offered to remake the salmon skin roll which I declined. I don't think I'll be coming back to Masa again."}
{"text":"Continues to be my absolute favorite place!  Everything from the iced green tea to the yummy fresh orange at the end and everything in between.  Hands down yummiest neighborhood sushi in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Came here for a little snacky-poo, and had an enjoyable time. Their sushi is... fine. It's fine. Seems like they specialize in rolls, which isn't really my thing. They have a TON of variety, and I'd imagine that people come here mostly for that reason.  I will say- their nigiri-zushi is cut in the Korean manner (which makes sense, because it's Korean owned), and I like that. The pieces of fish are a little longer and sort of drape over the rice- which aesthetically isn't as nice as the clean, rectangular Japanese style, but it looks nice in it's own way. They don't have a huge selection of fish to choose from, as I'd bet that most Gilbertians aren't hugely adventurous in this department. That's an issue for me, because when I go out for sushi I want some uni, ikura with a quail egg, saba, and ama-ebi. So I probably won't be coming back here, but not because of any issues with the food quality.  Their tempura is also pretty tasty, but similarly limited. All in all- if you want a huge selection of rolls and aren't too too picky about Japanese food, this is probably the place for you. You owe it to yourself to at least come check it out!!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed Masa sushi. My husband ordered the Ninja Dinner and got so much food! The service was good and they gave us a complimentary apple and orange dessert. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Don't know where all the 5 star reviews came from, we were in the area getting our car serviced for an hour and thought to grab lunch. Yelped area reviews and Masa came up. Walked in and was seated. The service was very good. The place looked a bit worn, floors looked old menu's very worn.  Photos of the dishes are hugely displayed \"ALL\" over. We ordered some Beers and Sake while looking over the menu. We ordered the Gyoza, the Sushi+ Spicy Tuna Roll Special (tune, shrimp, salmon, snapper, spicy tuna roll) and the Sake Bomber Sushi Sashimi Special (tuna, salmon, yellowtail, snapper)  The Gyoza were very good, the sushi sashimi quality of fish very very OK. The rice was horrible. When I tasted the salmon I bit into a fish bone.  Atmosphere: old and worn, Service: very good, Food: Sushi/Sashimi very OK."}
{"text":"Without a doubt, hands down our favorite sushi restaurant. It is our traditional \"anniversary dinner\" spot. Who knew you had to go to a sushi restaurant for the best stuffed jalapeño plate in Arizona? Also, the yellowtail is always fresh and butter smooth!  Take some time and enjoy our favorite!"}
{"text":"The perfect neighborhood sushi place. Fresh, consistently good food, reasonably priced. This is our go to spot. If you're looking for a tasteful decor and a modern vibe, try Ra or Blue Wasabi. For good sushi at  a good price, this place can't be beat."}
{"text":"Went by around 2:30 on my lunch break (they close at 3:00) for some takeout but the doors were locked. Very unprofessional. Didn't have time to eat bc I wasted my time here. Change your posted hours so others don't waste their time. Thanks!"}
{"text":"The sushi here is completely amazing! The prices are totally agreeable and let me tell you the amount of fish in each parcel is way more then expected! This place goes above and beyond when I comes to quality sushi! Definitely the best in Gilbert!!"}
{"text":"Pretty great sushi place, service was quicker than normal and the food was awesome."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for a couple years now and we love it! The fish tastes fresh and there are endless choices because they have options which split two rolls on one plate so you get to try more rolls rather than having 8 pieces of the same roll. They are constantly busy, but we have never really had a problem with waiting and being served. All the servers and sushi chefs have been kind. We are big fans of this place!"}
{"text":"What a gem!  This place is definitely our GO TO sushi spot, and not just because it's on our neighborhood.  The only time I've had better sushi, we were in San Francisco."}
{"text":"Happy Hour is all the time here :) delicious food! Nobody else in the restaurant while we were there. Very casual ambience. Great service.  Good prices too."}
{"text":"Usually I don't give five stars, i always question my self, am I going to look forward to come again? If so, what is the reason or is there more than one reason? In this restaurant there are more than one reasons why I will be looking forward to coming back!.  First is the service, outstanding! The second I entered I was greatest and directed to my chair... TWO seconds later I had my table set up with a small salad and a small cup of miso soup! Both were excellent! Then I ordered a beer, I hate a beer if its not very very cold and believe me not many restaurants grasp that concept, the beer was perfect! Them the menu, I like to see pictures of the sushi, might not be considered upscale for many, but for me helps me a lot to see the preparation and gives me a good indication to what expect. Place was not packed but there were many busy tables, the sushi I ordered was brought after only 3 minutes! The size of the thing!! And the quantity of the meat! This thing had tons of Tuna and Salmon mucho mas than average! And the taste, wow. After a short visit I'm looking forward to the next. This was a flawless experience and I would greatly recommend!"}
{"text":"The waitresses are always very friendly and give great service. The food is amazing. This is best sushi place in town."}
{"text":"Of all of my attempts to find a decent sushi place in the Phoenix East Valley, this one paid off. I have yet to find another sushi restaurant that has the same freshness, distinct flavors and sushi-deliciousness that Masa Sushi has. The value and top-notch service I've received here truly make it a gem of a place that Yelpers like me are thrilled to discover and share.  I love the fact that even before you order you are greeted with chilled iceberg lettuce salad (with a fabulous soy vinaigrette) and delicious hot miso soup. The list of rolls available is extensive. My dining partners and I have gravitated towards the Monkey Ball roll as an appetizer. That's a mushroom, spicy tuna, and cream cheese that is battered and deep fried and served with a delicious creamy sauce.  Try the simpler forms of sushi (sashimi, nigiri) to see how fresh and buttery and delicious the fish here is. I have recently started investigating their Happy Hour combos, and was very pleased with their spicy one (the name of which escapes me). This must've been a promotional or new combo. It was featured on the menu and on banners draped inside the store, but I haven't spotted it on their website yet. All I know is that I had wonderful bites that included spicy-tuna stuffed jalapeno \"poppers\", a salmon-centric roll, and Kiss of Fire (inside: spicy tuna, jalapeno, crab stick and cucumber; outside: white tuna).  All of this washes down perfectly with a nice dry Japanese beer like Asahi.  The dessert (standard with your order) is great fun too. Fresh mandarin oranges, thin sliced apples, caramel sauce, whipped cream and Pocky! You can't beat this place for the price, selection or the quality of the sushi. And it's in Gilbert... who'da thunk it!"}
{"text":"The food was good considering you are in the middle of the desert.  The waiters were extremely dipsy so please be prepared.  Let's get to the food lol the sushi rice was good so pretty much everything else was good.  I really enjoyed their poke salad it was really tasty."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi place in the valley. I am a sushi lover and have tried many sushi places in east valley. This place is my favorite! They provide best sushi for very good value. It is tasty, comes with complementary soup, salad and desert. Combos are a good sampler of several types of sushi! I love Masa Sushi!"}
{"text":"We always enjoy coming here! The quality is good. You also get salad and soup before your food which is a nice added plus"}
{"text":"They told is decent. Not the best sushi I've ever tasted, but not the worst for sure. Staff is nice enough but service is always slow. The free dessert after the meal really adds that forth star. I would for sure recommend it but wouldn't call it my favorite."}
{"text":"This place has excellent service. Not only that but they give you a salad, soup, and dessert with every meal. The dessert is super cute as it is fruit cut out in shapes and served along with chocolate covered pookie sticks. The rolls are priced at a bargain and don't worry on them being skimpy. They are loaded. They have an excellent seaweed salad. There is a fun outdoor seating available with a large projector screen with sports available for those who are addicts of ESPN. This is a win win for everyone."}
{"text":"The best sushi for wonderful prices, service can be a little ditzy occasionally but no other sushi compares, to me at least"}
{"text":"Hands down BEST sushi ever! We used to go to Masa weekly but then we moved to Chandler so we get out there much less often. We have been looking for a sushi place that measures up to Masa but can't find one!"}
{"text":"This is my goto for Sushi in the Gilbert area.  I pieces are big and the prices are low!  They start you out with a soup and a salad with a yummy dressing.  Then your sushi comes, Then they bring you a nice dessert of thinly sliced and artistically arranged apple slices, half a orange and pocky sticks drizzled in a raspberry sauce I believe and whip cream!  Great way to finish!  Be sure to have your picture taken for the wall.  I am someplace on those walls.  Happy Hour.....All day!"}
{"text":"We frequent this place with our kids. It's ok, the sushi is somewhat fresh, the variety is great. If you like to eat alot of sushi and don't really care for perfection in relation to size and quality then this is your place. I know a lot of people come here because it is cheap. The atmosphere is a bit crowded and loud, nothing fancy, just store front tables and worn down chairs.  The servers already know what we like. We have not had consistent experiences though. One time we sat outside and there where crickets all over and roaches running about, we mentioned this to the waiter and he laughed it off. The outside dinning is dirty and they did not clean the patio or the tables.  The up side is how cheap it is. $5 for a tuna roll, and they have many combo meals to try a variety of rolls that are fair in price. Their complimentary salad is blah and miso soup salty. The male waiter is the best hands down, the other two female ones always forget something and are not attentive. The beers and hot sake are decent and cheap. The majority of their sushi is deep fried and consists of heavy sauces or cream cheese. I prefer fresher ingredients and the taste of the actual fish. I have ordered their sashimi many times and their is never any consistency with the size and portion of the cuts, usually they should be about the same they never are. Their sashimi is not a great value due to the small portions, the sushi rice is also inconsistent. Some days it is soft, others undercooked and stale.  This is our family go to default quick eat because it is close, but if we go on a date...this is not the place we go to. Now after writing this review I wonder if we will continue to go.... This place is at the very least worth at try to see if you enjoy it."}
{"text":"If you want fancy, expensive, high quality sushi, this may not be the place for you. If you have a sudden craving for sushi but don't want to break the bank, this is most definitely the place for you! I would have given this place a 3 or 3.5 if based on the food alone however the service is always great and they give you free stuff which bumps them up a star. As far as the free stuff goes, they give you a small salad and miso soup before your meal and then a cute little dessert at the end. I love free food, especially when it's good, so they won me over on that. Regarding the food you actually pay for, there are a few things to avoid. My husband and I really didn't like the tuna appetizer they have as the fish was either low quality or cut incorrectly. Also, the sashimi isn't anything special. However they make some amazing rolls. My absolute favorite is the hot Arizona roll. Simple, but absolutely glorious! I approve of this establishment :)"}
{"text":"As soon as you enter you are greeted by the sushi chefs which makes you feel very welcomed. The sushi bar is my favorite place to sit. Watching the chef prepare my sushi is like watching an artist paint. The sushi here is so mouth watering and succulent. Each bite I take my taste buds are shouting for joy.   My meal  starts out with a salad and bowl of miso soup (FREE) and I  order the #9 Edamame ($3.50), (who knew that soybeans could be so  good), then on to the Happy Hour menu I order the #30 Monkey Ball and Stuffed Jalapeno($5.00), #27 Hawaiian and Rainbow Rolls ($7.95) , #32  Philadelphia and Salmon Love Rolls($8.50),#33 Hot Arizona and Spicy &  Spicy Rolls($8.50), #34 Hawaiian and Fresh Yellow Tail Rolls($8.50),  and for dessert a sliced apple and orange artistically cut with whipped  cream and a raspberry sauce on top ( FREE). My girlfriend and I share  this meal and we always leave stuffed. Also since we are regulars the  chef sometimes makes us a special sushi creation that is always so  creative and delicious(FREE).  All in all this is by far the best sushi restaurant I have ever been to and the fact that its in Arizona it is even more shockingly good. If I eat here anymore often I am sure to develop gout from all the rich sushi :)"}
{"text":"Been going here since I was like 5. Such a great place to eat. Every time I go on vacation to Arizona we always have MASA on the to do list"}
{"text":"My first five star review. Finally. This place is awesome. Got the deep fried lobster sushi dish. Was so good the other day I came back here without my girl to eat solo. That's how good this dish is!!  Will be back."}
{"text":"I've been coming to masa since they opened...they have a wide variety of sushi, rolls, and appetizers. They also have rice and noodle bowls. The chicken teriyaki over rice is my kids fav... The jalapeño poppers are the best I've had. They even sub the tuna that usually comes in the poppers for spicy crab meat, which I prefer and highly recommend! Mmmmm.... The service is always friendly and I've never had to wait to be seated. They also greet you at your table with a salad that has a sweet soy dressing that's delish! They also serve a miso soup with the salad. It's a little too salty for my taste tho! Overall great sushi and great experiences with friends and family!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat!! Friendly staff , food is delicious and great prices . Has a small town family feel. Will definitely become a regular since I live down the block ."}
{"text":"Came here with my girlfriend this Saturday night at 8:20pm, they maybe had 5 tables, super not busy. Waited a couple minutes before someone showed up to seat us, and then got our drinks fairly quickly. Literally waited over 30 minutes, waitress never came by. She waited the table next to us, got their order and delivered it, but never came to us. I get it if it's busy. I get it if they are understaffed. But there were 3 people standing at the sushi bar not doing anything. Eventually we just left. We paid for my girlfriend's iced tea, but considering it wasn't very good, and the service was literally nonexistent, we shouldn't have paid at all.   Not coming back."}
{"text":"Best place ever!!!! The place is great and the sushi is delicious.  Jasmine was our server and she was amazing!  We will definitely be back very soon.  We found our new favorite"}
{"text":"This is Been my absolutely favorite sushi for the last couple of years. I've eaten at many places in Phoenix that this one is the most authentic and absolutely delicious everything is fresh. My favorite role is the Hawaiian."}
{"text":"Great sushi! Fun date night spot. Awesome happy hour especially for a Friday night! Who has all day happy hour on a Friday?! Can't wait to come back and try other kinds."}
{"text":"Seriously great sushi. Their prices have gone up a lot over the last 5 years but their rolls are all pretty good."}
{"text":"There are very few good sushi places in the east valley, masa is one. I was amazed and surprised. The place isn't too big, but has out door seating.   The decor is not the best, but standard. The chairs are comfortable, and the sushi chef and staff are very nice. You don't like it? No problem! It gets fixed, and promptly! The rolls are decent, and the fish is fresh! They have a variety box as well, but I forget what its called. It has some rice, sushi, tempura ect. Did I mention free desert?  They have a free desert! Its an apple cut up and splayed out with a half of an orange. Topped with whipped cream and pocky sticks. After that you don't feel all gross either!  I highly recommend this place, for great sushi, good atmosphere, and the out door seating! Its getting nice outside....go to masa!"}
{"text":"This is our regular Sushi place! We always do one of the combos with sake bombs. Good rolls and decent prices. Casual and relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"Must've been an off day because their sushi wasn't all that. Come on, people are rating this place with 5 stars? For real?? They either don't know what good sushi is, or Masa Sushi was having an off day. It was mediocre sushi, with rice that seemed a tad too mushy for my liking.  The rice is pretty important to me, as is the fish. Again, it was just okay. For a lunch outing with my daughter, we ordered 2 sushi combos and had water, and our bill was $36. Plus tip it was $43. I don't mind paying that much for lunch, but to give an idea....I paid right around that for a nice sushi dinner at Roka Akor in Scottsdsle.  For just standard tasting sushi that was supposed to be a quick lunch, we weren't impressed and will keep trying to find a good sushi spot for next time. We left feeling ripped off."}
{"text":"Garbage.  This is your typical AZ, Korean owned/run, sushi + \"Asian fusion\", quantity over quality sushi joint. Don't let the Korean comment sour you. There are a few very good Korean sushi places here in AZ, but they're few and far between. If you don't know the difference between a Korean sushi place and a Japanese sushi place, simply add 3 stars to my rating and stop reading now.  For most people, this place will be just fine, but if you are a big sushi fan and have a lot of experience eating sushi, you will be disappointed.  The good: - Water  The Bad: - Green Muscles were mushy in the center and, frankly, tasted bad and old. - Fresh chopped wasabi was not good. How this is possible, I have no idea. - PONZU SAUCE ON EVERYTHING!! WTF? I want to taste the damn rice, how in the hell can I taste the rice if it's drowning in Ponzu sauce? EPIC FAIL. - Fish pieces on Nigiri and Sashimi were WAY too big and too thick and threw the ratio off.  I left about 15 pieces of sushi on the table. This is the first time something like this has ever happened. Again, if your idea of good sushi is an evening of \"Uber AZ Rolls\" or any roll with ingredients more than rice, seaweed, single fish, go here, eat, have fun. If you refuse to soil soy sauce with wassabi and dip your nigiri upside down in the soy sauce, avoid this place like the plague."}
{"text":"This place is delicious and they have amazing deals! We love their sushi dinner combos."}
{"text":"LOVED the beef yakisoba. My husband had the popcorn  lobster and a couple of rolls and was very happy. Family friendly. Our waiter was awesome."}
{"text":"Its a good place for a mix between japanese and korean food. I had the eal which is one of my favorites. It was good, the flavor of the eel though was heavily hidden from the excess amount of sauce they poured on it.   The rice, a defining signature of well prepped cooking was nice and sticky as it should be for japanese style.   I had some other assortments of other sushi's and were well prepped, well portioned, and were one of the better sushi places I have had in town."}
{"text":"Fun place. I loved the tasty free dessert but felt the quality of the fish was meh."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, Masa Sushi is the BEST! Love this place!  Service is incredibly friendly. I've called in a few to-go orders and they're always nice on the phone. The prices are good for HUGE rolls, plus you can get 1/2 and 1/2 rolls if you don't want to commit to just one thing.  I highly recommend Masa. Best sushi in Gilbert!"}
{"text":"Finally found A GOOD sushi restaurant in my area! we decided to try this place after going to some awful sushi restaurants  in the Gilbert area!  I don't like chains like RA............. And I am a bit spoiled to good sushi since I used live in NY/ NJ area and it had been a bit hard to find a place that actually had good and fresh fish!  until I went to Masa.  their service is very good, their Happy Hour is awesome!  they always include soup, salad and dessert with your meal during happy hour."}
{"text":"Grandparents always come here, everyone is always friendly, food is never bad, portions are nicer for the price you pay as they always end up with takeaway! They also love dessert here!  Tip: if you leave a review you get free edamame or gyoza! We went for the edamame"}
{"text":"Food was the best part.  I would have given a 4 if the service was a little more engaging.  Then I went to the bathrooms (gross) and had to drop to 3 stars...  Nice to have a free miso soup, iceberg salad and fresh fruit at the end of the meal.  Has the potential for 4 to 5 stars...!"}
{"text":"Best sushi I've had in Valley so far. The price is stellar for the amount of food you get and the freshness is excellent.  Definitely try the baked mussels!"}
{"text":"We love it here their sushi is not only amazing but it gets to the table quickly. The prices are fantastic, with a great selection of combos. Great for kids too! It is our favorite go to place."}
{"text":"This is always a favorite of mine.  Friendly staff, fresh sushi and a nice complimentary fruit desert st the end.    I would highly recommend the salmon or tuna salad as they are very good.  I did I mixture of both tuna and salmon on this most recent visit.   Warning:   The rolls are GIANT here so before you order to much sushi make sure you look around at other table and size them up for yourself.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My go-to place.  Love their una don, spicy jalapeno rolls, spicy edimomi and Salmon rocks. They go great with my Nigori Saki."}
{"text":"Went to Masa for the first time tonight. The food and the service were amazing!!! Sushi was fresh and the prices were super reasonable. I loved the soup and salad served at the beginning of the meal. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've been been here several times and every time, they have been consistently good. The sushi always tastes fresh and is very flavorful, and the the service is excellent too. I'm definitely a fan!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. It's the only place you can get 2 different rolls as one.  Their soft shell crab is wonderful. Service can be a little slow at times, however they are very friendly. Best thing about this place is its very affordable and tastes great."}
{"text":"I decided to meet a friend here on a whim for a relaxing Friday night dinner. I was looking for a place close to my house that specifically did a sushi happy hour. I figured this establishment was a good bet based on the reviews. Not so much. I then realized when it comes to sushi in Arizona, I've been steered wrong so many times, which makes me believe most people in Arizona haven't had excellent sushi, on a coast. When you've eaten a lot of sushi, you know quality vs. crap.   The good thing was this place wasn't the worst sushi I've had, but it definitely was down there on the list. The pieces of fish were huge and disproportionate to the rice, which should be the first red flag. Sushi is small & pricey for a reason.   The fish was cut haphazardly, the nigiri was three times the size as the rice beneath it. Oh, and the weirdest thing was this strange clear gooey sauce under all the rolls AND nigiri. At first I thought I was tasting something funny with the fish but after asking the waitress, we found they put ponzu sauce on EVERY single roll and under the rice with the nigiri. Now, don't get me wrong, I like ponzu sauce, but not on everything. When I'm ordering a yellowtail roll, I don't want a gooey sweet sauce masking the flavor of the fish and rice. Maybe they were trying to mask the flavor of the fish and rice? Hmmmmm.   I ordered one of the special rolls. It was nothing special. I specifically noticed the tuna on the outside to be too firm and chewy and the spicy tuna on the inside to be way too mushy. It was all a horrible consistency.  The bill was cheap, $67 for three people and that's with about twice as much fish as we could eat. Would I go back? No. Was it the worst? No, but I'm not a fan of taking risks with sushi."}
{"text":"Amazingly fresh and delicious sashimi plates.  Also loved the Masa Maki rolls!  This is the best sushi place I have found in AZ."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for a while. All the sushi Chefs are really good. Best place for sushi in Gilbert"}
{"text":"I don't get the hype. It's definitely an Americanized sushi joint. Most things are fried, baked and/or swimming in sauce....  I enjoy sushi for the delicate flavors of fresh fish. The pieces of the rolls are HUGE, so you can't fit the entire piece in your mouth easily (that's what she said).  It'll do if I am in suburbia. But overall, there are better places."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi restaurant in All of East AZ.... The fish is fresh.... They are fast,efficient, authentic, and polite. This atmosphere is conducive to a family and while the location is in a strip mall of sorts do not let that deter you in any way from getting awesome Sushi... I highly recommend it ."}
{"text":"Very good food!  The sushi and bento were delicious! Good quality and quantity. I will come back for good traditional Japanese food."}
{"text":"I was eager to go after reading reviews, but was severely disappointed.  I caught one of the taller sushi chefs picking his nose. Classy.  If you want to know what an experience at Masa's is like, simply take your shoe and lick the bottom of it. There, I just saved you some cash."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant. The food is prepared wonderfully well. The service is also good. I had the chicken teriyaki bowl with veges. Yummm"}
{"text":"The sushi is incredible, my favorite was the spicy tuna, it was so so good. The apple desert at the end was a great touch and very creative!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in the valley.  Very traditional and fun environment.  Sushi never disappoints and their long happy hour means quality priced sushi"}
