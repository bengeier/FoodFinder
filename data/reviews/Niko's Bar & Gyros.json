{"text":"Had their standard lamb and beef gyro with fries, great all around, they definitely give you your money's worth. Would recommend to a friend"}
{"text":"Great place can't remember  the last time I had so much fun staff are friendly and welcoming food is delicious menu is affordable very clean environment will be going here more often with my family and friends."}
{"text":"Niko's is a favorite of mine and I stop in a couple times a month.  I have tried a lot on their menu and it is all good but I always come back to the traditional gyro or the gyro burger.  Come with an appetite, these portions are big.  Please keep doing what you're doing and I'll keep coming in for great food!"}
{"text":"Walked in and three staff members were sitting at the bar. They just stared at us when we walked in like we weren't supposed to be there. I even said \"hey\" and then they turned around without a response. They were all wearing Nikos shirts so I know they were employees. Just a little courtesy goes a long way."}
{"text":"I live pretty close to Niko's, and its my first stop for when I want to watch a UFC/boxing match. Aside from the hard-ass benches that wrap around the place, this is a good sports bar with an outside patio and a good selection of booze. The gyros are very fresh, large, and come with an order of fries. It's a good amount of food and I usually save half for later. Lots of variety on the gyro menu, but I get the traditional old faithful gyro every time and have never been disappointed.   Nice patio, nice wait staff, good food, and shows UFC so I don't have to go to BW3. I'm in."}
{"text":"Worst gyro I have ever had  Bar looks good with lots of TV and they have nice little patio I can hang out there but not the gyro and the only reason why I went there was gyro which was not good so here is my 1star review   Will try one more time and will update"}
{"text":"Food is great! Awesome selection of microbrews!  The staff is friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time tonight and the gyro was bigger than a chipotle burrito!!! Soooo yummy!!!!"}
{"text":"Don't let the fact this place is in a strip mall deter you! We came in from out of town for a wedding and were looking for a place to grab some good food and a good beer. Nikos does more than check the boxes! Craft beer selection phenomenal and food superb. Do yourself a favor and stop in!!!"}
{"text":"I live in Strongsville and was looking for a gyro place closer than Brunswick where I usually go. Looked at reviews on Yelp along with my son and his friends that said how great their food was ....I had to try. Bought three take out gyro dinners, one chicken for son, two lamb, for me and hubby. To be honest I was expecting a great gyro from all the good opinions....sorry to say I can't give 5 stars for food. The reason it got 3 stars is...the place is small but nice inside, nice front patio and workers were on top of things asking if we were taken care of by more than one. Although, they do give you a lot of meat in gyro, and meat tastes good, it lacks everything else...skimpy on tomatoes, onion and I would advise anyone who orders gyro to ask for Tzatziki Sauce, or extra...I really don't know what the sauce tastes like because I barely got any on my gyro nor did my husband on his, basically, it was a pita with meat. Also the fries seemed stale. I'm truly sorry my experience wasn't better. I really wanted to have a closer place I could frequent more often with good food, since we love gyros. Looks like our drive to Brunswick will continue!"}
{"text":"I'm starting to love this place. Great gyros, a small but excellent selection of craft beers on tap (Dogfish Head, Three Floyds, and others), Keno if you are so inclined, and friendly service. I may become a regular here.  Oh, and when they say something will be spicy ... trust them."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, great beers!  I typically get the traditional gyro. Huge sandwich that even a 300# guy like me will struggle to finish. TONS of meat, and good meat at that!    Today tried the Greek salad. As good as the gyro. Beautiful presentation. Got through half of it. Washed it down with a 3 Floyds Zombie Dust IPA.   I'm not sure if gyro meat is good for my diet, but if it's not, life isn't worth living!"}
{"text":"Awesome home made hummus in variety of flavored. Not a lot of menu variety, but we love the gyro variations so a favorite stop."}
{"text":"Niko's is the best. For a neighborhood bar/restaurant, it hits the sweet spot for sports, location, food, drinks, specials, atmosphere, and service. Everything is just how you would want it to be.   If you live in the area, you probably already know that Niko's is a solid choice. If you're searching on yelp for a good place to go tonight, you've found what you're looking for.   Pro-tip: Get the gyro."}
{"text":"Great beer selection. I have the spicy Chicken gyro and my wife had the mushroom and Swiss chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"Great beer selection. Great service.  Portions large. Gyros good. Hummus very good. Try jalapeño hummus."}
{"text":"Best place to grab a gyro in Cleveland area. On Royalton Road, but a bit away from the highway, so even living on the west side, it can be a bit of a pain to get here. Pretty small place so be prepared to wait, but the food usually comes pretty quick. Service is good, and almost always very prompt. Solid draft list. Definitely a focus on craft beers from Ohio. I like how the focus on the whole state, not just the immediate area, because almost every bar has Cleveland brews, but here there are a greater array of choices. This is a very rare restaurant where I get the same meal every time. The lamb and beef gyro is so good, that even though other options sound good, it's hard to change. Sometimes you can't mess with the original, and this is one of those situations. The combination of the gyro and side of fries (not homemade unfortunately) are completely filling. If my fiance can't finish her meal, it is a challenge for me to do it, and that is not normally the case. During the fall, they also carry clam bakes on most Saturdays. If you come to one, bethere early as they will sometimes run out. The food here is outstanding. Small, cozy atmosphere of a sports bar, with patio seating when the NE Ohio weather complies. Good craft beer selection, plus a meal that fills you up for only $8.75, definitely worth the trip out here every time."}
{"text":"definitely 4.5 to 5 stars.  i can't remember the last time i've had food like this in a \"bar.\" Danielle and i had a late lunch at Nikos because I wanted some good hummus. since we've had their hummus \"to go\" before we decided to stop in for lunch.   Ohio brewed drafts were $3 on Sundays so I ordered a Dortmunder Gold and later a Fat Head's Spookytooth (i can't believe it's out already). i drank both so fast i had the faintest trace of a buzz.   For food, we shared some hummus as an appetizer. There was so much that by the time our lunches came we were already full but we tried anyway. Danielle had a regular gyro and fries and i had the Niko's Original - a gyro w/ smoked pork. I don't have the words to tell you how great it was. Just delicious. the pork alone tasted so good. Danielle and i frequent many BBQ joints and none, so far, has had pork that tasted as good as this. the french fries, while frozen - yes, frozen (big deal) - were fried perfectly w/ a nice seasoning. I wanted to eat them all but had to stop myself and ask for a to go container before i burst.   there's no doubt i'll be back. seriously the best meal i've had in a long time.   the only negatives i would say are that the tzatziki sauce lacked a whole lot of cucumber flavor - at least as far as i could tell. also, people in the bar were talking inappropriately (i feel) around kids sitting at nearby tables. though, i personally never understand bringing kids into a bar to begin with. that said, they were so unimportant i'd only take away a half star from my review.   loved it."}
{"text":"This is a great place for those who like Gyro's.  The amount of meat you get is almost too much.  The price is very reasonable ($8.75 for a lamb and beef Gyro with French fries).  They also have chicken, corned beef, pork, and others.  The fries were also good, and they have a good selection of craft beers."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today. Smallish, but big enough. I probably wouldn't walk in during peak hours, but I was here early. Gyro was great and the beer list decent; fries were pretty good, too. Service was friendly from both the bartender and what I think was the owner. Will be back... soon."}
{"text":"Was in Ohio visiting for 3 days and went to Niko's 3 times.  It was great and we look forward to going there on our next visit.  The traditional Gyro is huge - big enough to share for most."}
{"text":"I've been to Nikos several times now. They have really good hummus. To be honest I haven't tried anything else but the place is always packed and the menu looks good. So I will definitely be back to try other food options.  My Yelp review today is actually about the service. I stopped to get a to-go order of the red pepper hummus. Unfortunately when I got home I realize they had given me the wrong order. Instead of the red pepper hummus I received three containers of the special that day which was avocado hummus.   I tasted it and it was edible but I called the store to let them know that they had given me the wrong order because I felt bad that I had somebody else's food. And obviously I got more food than I paid for. Minus the veggies I really wanted.   The first girl I talked to was very apologetic about me getting the wrong order and offered for me to come back and pick up the correct one. But I had already gone home and it was a 15 minute Drive so I didn't want to turn around and go back. She said let me put you on hold for a minute.  That typically I would have expected her to get the manager and try and rectify the situation because when all was said and done I did receive the wrong food it was not what I ordered. No veggies and no red pepper hummus.  But instead another girl gets on the phone and doesn't introduce herself so I don't even know if she was the manager or not and she was all snarky with me telling me how the sign on the wall says to check your order before you leave and there's nothing they can do for me.  So i explain to her I wasn't asking for anything I was calling to tell them that they gave me the wrong order so that they knew that another person received my order ...end of story.   Because of that interaction alone I'm giving Niko only 3 stars. That is not the way to gain customer satisfaction."}
{"text":"Good burgers, the Gyro's are awesome. We live around corner from Nico's, this place is a treat."}
{"text":"Been here half a dozen times now and have never been disappointed. One of the best craft beer selections around and they support the local brewers ($3 a pint for Ohio drafts on Sunday) I can't speak for the entire menu cause I keep ordering the spicy chicken gyro every time. Its friggin delicious and sweat on your brow spicy.   The only drawback is its a little too cozy. They could use a little more elbow room."}
{"text":"Ordered chicken clam bake....nothing like getting raw chicken served.  not impressed and will.never go.back"}
{"text":"Lamb and beef gyro was so huge and delicous. Flavor was amazing! Really loved the atmosphere too. Small, friendly, always sports on TV. Great bar selection too. Highly recommend, just not the best for larger groups."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Great service. Always a welcoming atmosphere! They have a wide variety of beers, if you aren't into beer- their bartenders are AWESOME and can make you anything!   LOVE THIS PLACE!   Be sure to try all the different types of hummus!  If youre lucky you may even run into Niko himself!"}
{"text":"We come here at least once a month. Best gyro's around hands down. Also god craft brew selection."}
{"text":"Honestly I was not even in the mood for gyros when my friend picked this restaurant so I just went with it.  Ordered the lamb and beef gyro.  It tasted amazing.  Seriously delicious. Ohio beers for $3.  Good quality service.  I would definitely recommend eating here. Loved the warm atmosphere."}
{"text":"We've been trying to get away from big chains and have also been in a bit of a rut with our usual places. A quick internet search brought us to Niko's, and man did they deliver. Small place with a sports bar feel (and plenty of TVs to watch my playoff-bound Indians) and a patio that filled up quickly, and a good selection of craft beers for those who are into them. We started with the fried cheese and pita appetite which was tasty but maybe not quite worth the price, and then went with the Niko burger: a burger topped with amazing gyro meat, feta cheese, and a side of their incredible gyro/tzatziki type sauce. SOOOOO delicious. Service was pretty prompt for how busy they were and all the employees were friendly. We will be back."}
{"text":"It was mine and my wifes first time here. While the service was great, it had a couple...oddities to it.   First, there was a creepy guy on the patio smoking and trying to hit on the waitresses. While that doesnt affect the service, it didnt help enhance it. The girls were clearly a little freaked and went in fairly quickly.  Secondly, the music was a bit loud. I felt like i was shouting slightly just to hold a conversation with my wife. Not to mention. They had cursing In the songs while kids were out on the patio.  The food. It was good, however didn't really fill us at all. My wife ordered the Niko's original, which is pictured below. The amount you get for 8.50 a gyro is awesome. But nevertheless didnt get the job done.  All in all, an okay at best experience."}
{"text":"Amazing food, and a $3 draft of the day that's usually pretty interesting and well worth the money. Solid bar."}
{"text":"I love this little bar/restaurant. It has the best gyros hands down in Cleveland.They have great seafood specials at different times of the year. The wait staff goes way out of their way to accommodate you and the owner is very nice."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner based on a great recommendation from my dad. I was very excited about a great gyro place, but to my disappointment they would not accommodate to my fish allergy, so the only thing I could eat was the salad, hummus, and french fries. My boyfriend and I split the buffalo hummus which was great! He got the lamb gyro which he said was delicious. I got the Greek salad, it was good. I wouldn't go back just because I can't order much from the menu."}
{"text":"Amazing food. It would be a disservice to call it bar food. The Nikos Burger is the best burger in town."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Great food and drink selections. The prices are very reasonable and food portions are large. You won't go home hungry here. Very clean restaurant and the staff is hard working. Give this place a try it's well worth it. I always try to support family run operations and they have been around for a long time and do a great job. 5 star rating is an easy call after our experience."}
{"text":"Wine down Wednesday - $10 for a $7 bottle of wine - can't beat in NR.  Had Hummus sampler And gyro - way too much garlic!   How about a little flavor in the gyro?  Wanted to take rest of hummus home - no spoons to scope out of bowls - seriously!  Spoons ? Restaurant?"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food! I always get take out and it never disappoints. If you want a lot of food get the lamb gyro it will take you three sittings to eat it all. The buffalo hummus is also amazing sounds weird but if you like spicy you will love it !"}
{"text":"I liked this place, cute and friendly inside.  Their patio is small but nice with a TV outside.  The Gyros were great but you will taste them for a while after.  My suggestion is order the sauce on the side it can get messy and if you are sharing order an extra pita bread!"}
{"text":"My husband got saganaki and a regular Gyro. He said it was one of the better gyros he's had and the cheese was good  I got a chicken club gyro. It was tasty  Not far from our house, so I'm sure we will be back.   Mondays all draft beers are $3!!"}
{"text":"Great place for HEALTHY bar food. I ordered the cilantro jalapeño hummus and it was so fresh delicious and spicy!! I also had the vegetarian gyro which is veggies in a pita with sauce on the side. VERY GOOD! I recommend all vegans and vegetarians nearby stop in!!"}
{"text":"It's the weirdest thing. The smokers have this thing were they put their chairs up like its closing time when obviously a full gamut of drinks are at their seats, just really strange. Bartender had an attitude like you were wasting her time, no mind you unfamiliar to their beer selection. Perhaps she was having an off day or needs a new career. Move on!!! Go to Olessoa."}
{"text":"Niko's is a great North Royalton bar/restaurant. Cozy atmosphere with lots of cool decor. There is also a small outdoor patio with TVs. I've been going to Niko's for a few years and have always had great experiences. The staff and food are always great. I recommend the lamb and beef gyro - it's so tasty!!! Niko's is perfect for dinner and drinks or game nights. 2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"The best gyro in Cleveland, HANDS DOWN! My boyfriend and I frequent this place at least 2-3 times a month. Not only are their Gyro's to die for, their Hummus sampler is amazing an Greek salad (with Gyro meat)! .   The atmosphere while small, is elegant and clean. Great beer selection and beer specials and the staff is always on point and friendly!   However 2 complaints, get rid of the plastic silverware! The seats are NOT comfortable. They have a bench style bar stool running the length of the bar, and boy is it uncomfortable. However, food is so good we don't usually care.   Niko the owner is usually present, and he is kind, professional and always making sure the customers are happy."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Greek salad with blackened salmon was outstanding!  My 10 year old who is a picky eater destroyed his kids menu Gyro."}
{"text":"I have been missing Niko's since it closed up in Lakewood.  I am so happy Niko has decided to bring his Greek goodness to North Royalton!  We started off with a trio of hummus dips - each was fantastic but the spicy feta hummus was the best!  The dips come with fresh pita, cucumbers, and carrots.  Perfect for sharing.  All three of us absolutely loved our meals - the mini gyro combo, the vegetarian gyro, and the spicy chicken gyro. All of the meals came with fries too.  The gyros were all under $10 and we all needed to-go boxes.    The atmosphere was friendly and laid back - perfect place to hang out and watch some tv or play keno.  The patio out front is nice too!  They also had a large variety of craft beers and beers on special too.    I can't wait to go back :)"}
{"text":"We've been to Nikos several times!  Always fresh and reasonable!  The Greek Salad with Chicken or Lamb and Beef, as well as the traditional gyros never disappoint!  Good beer selection, as well!"}
{"text":"That's gyros I ever had. The beef and lamb is perfect with the perfect Suzuki garlic sauce. If you like Gyros this is the place"}
{"text":"An intimate bar with a shaded patio with outdoor heaters when it's chilly, plenty of large televisions with local and national sports action, sports paraphernalia, Ohio Lottery EZPLAY and KENO, and phenomenal hamburgers and gyros.  I would not recommend the blackened, grouper gyro.  However, the burgers are as good as any I have ever had, comparable to B Spot. The fries are delicious, too. The gyros are the best I've ever had, and each meal is plenty large."}
{"text":"The attention to detail and precision is evident the second you walk in the door, every frame hung just so, every television mounted just so, every surface gleaming, including the floor.  The Thai chili lime wings were just hot enough to break a mild sweat, but incredibly flavorful and meaty. My Gyro burger was more than I could finish, and the fries were exactly the way I like them, with a slight crunch and a perfect interior.  My son had a cheddar bacon cheeseburger cooked absolutely to perfection medium rare, and even his mighty appetite was vanquished before he got through all the fries.  The service was attentive, but we were one of about four patrons late on a Saturday night so I can't say what it's like when busy, but as a rideshare driver I have dropped off and picked up from this place when it was hopping so clearly Niko's is doing something right."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Niko's in Lakewood and was very pleased to hear he was opening a place near our part of the world. Tonight was our first visit, and while it won't be our last, we won't be rushing back.   I think he and his team did a great job turning a wine bar into a cool little sports bar. It IS small, but that's ok, it's cool.   We ordrered the garlic hummus dip which, sadly, seemed to have zero garlic in it. It also had zero taste. They were nice enough to take it off our bill. Even one of the servers mentioned it didn't smell like there was any garlic in it. BTW, all the servers were extremely pleasant and professional. Kudos to them.   My wife ordered the mini gryos and I tried the lamb and beef.  There was nothing \"wrong\" with any of it, there just wasn't much there that encouraged us to have it again.  The beef and lamb had almost a grainy, kind of mushy feel and taste to it., and the chicken in my wife's minis were too dry to eat at least without a lot of sauce.  There is a similar place a few miles east on 82 that (so far, anyway) we greatly prefer.  In fairness to Niko's I won't mention the name.   We WILL go back as I really don't like writing a place off after one visit (unless we're talking filth or total and complete assholery from a manager or owner).  They have burgers and wings and perhaps they're great. We'll be back to find out. Hey, we pull for locally owned places and want Niko's to succeed. That alone requires another visit."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Gyro in the city of Cleveland.  The only thing that even gets a little close is the gyro at the fair.  However Nikos is twice as large and probably a buck less.  Nikos is by far the best tzatziki sauce I have had.  Although a bit thick the taste is unparalleled.  If you like garlic like I do then beware.  Niko uses enough Garlic keep all the Vampires in True Blood away.  If your not a fan of the lamb beef combo then I suggest the Chicken Gyro.  This is not quite as large but is still large enough to fill you up.  There are other lighter items which appear to be a big hit but I have not tried. IE Salmon Gyro and salads.  All Gyros come with a large side of fries (which are salted heavily)  recommendation is to ask for unsalted to control this.  If there is a complaint its the beer.  While Nikos has one of the best craft beer selections in the area with the daily feature beer of 3.00.  There should be a domestic beer on tap as well.  Its not to say that you cant get a domestic.  Plenty of choices are available in the cooler.  All im saying is it would be nice to get a Miller Light on daft from time to time.  A nice bonus is the amount of tvs that Nikos has in this place with almost as many tvs as seats your sure to see the game you want with no problem seeing all the action.  Even though its -10 degrees it appears that the patio will be quite nice this summer as well with the ability to watch the game on the patio as well.  Bottom line Nikos is the place to snarf a great Gyro and try a craft beer.  If you leave Nikos hungry it might be time to get checked for a tape worm."}
{"text":"Love love love Nikos!!!!  Used to go to the Lakewood location and was bummed when it closed, ONLY place to get saganaki!!  AMAZING!!!!"}
{"text":"Niko's has the best pulled pork I've ever eaten! As well as a lot of the things on there menu"}
{"text":"Best gyro, hands down. The service here is great for both dine in and carry out. The patio is great and they have Bumbleberry on tap. Sold."}
{"text":"Best gyro I ever had went in last night while visiting family had a drink and ordered wings and gyros the best service was great bartender was a female very good thanks niko coming back today before heading back to Boston"}
{"text":"Daaaaang, Niko's. You're good. You're really good.   For a small joint in a tiny strip mall, this place delivers. The interior is nice, they have TVs out the yin yang (this phrase is not used nearly enough these days, I'M BRINGING IT BACK), the service is attentive n' quick and the FOOD IS BOMB. I can't find a single thing I dislike about this place... Wait. I got one. The mirror in the ladies room is hung high- I'm talking WNBA height here and I feel discriminated against. But. I forgive you, Niko's. Can I get a step stool in there though? Jk. I mean, kind of...  So, back to business, the food is bomb. The gyros are ginormo. I can't finish one by myself and will typically take it to go if I have to. The gyro meat is flavorful and moist - I actually order the greek salad + gyro meat pretty often and I'm never disappointed. The price is right and the staff are so friendly, attentive, and just all around care that you're enjoying your meal. I love this place and this is my love letter to Niko's. Xoxo, Colleen"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, but the service stinks.  The booth built in the back of the bar is really uncomfortable.  Did I mention the service sucks.    This might be one of the few places to get mediocre Greek food on the south side, but this place does not deserve all the good reviews it has.  The food is good, the location is ok at best, and the setting is bad,   and the service is well below what is to be expected at a bar.  It is what it is, do not go out of your way to cone here."}
{"text":"Located in a mini strip-mall this fast casual restaurant provides friendly and fast service in a fun atmosphere. Their main feature is gyros. They have the traditional lamb gyro, but several other options. I chose the Spicy Chicken Gyro. Like the non-spicy version it had lettuce, tomato and chicken, but the chicken was coated with Cajun seasoning and the pita bread was drizzled with Sriracha. There was definitely a lot of heat from the Sriracha and the Cajun seasoning was excellent. The portion was very good too and the fries were tasty. If you're ever in the area this is a great place for a fast and tasty lunch."}
{"text":"Excellent gyros! Some of the best I've had anywhere. Super garlicky and salty, but that's expected. Did I mention garlic? You're gonna be swimming in it afterward.   Smallish, neighborhood bar feel. Super friendly servers/barkeeps. Very attentive.   Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Good food and service never had a bad meal. Lots of homemade food and a great drink menu"}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night with my wife and daughter.  Pretty sure the people here used to have a Greek restaurant years ago in Lakewood.  I'm talking 10-15 years ago.  They then opened a Gyro place in Strongsville that lasted a year or two.  I was so bummed when that closed because they made the best Gyros.  This version has been here several years and has a good following on the West Side.  Decor is a good mix of Sports and beer.  You can see a TV anywhere you sit in the place.  Workers are super nice and seem to work together which makes things go by quickly.  When I walked in it was busy and it's hard to tell where to check in.  I walked over to the bar area and 3 different people looked at me who work there and looked away.  A 4th person asked me if I was being helped.  I told her I was looking for a table for 3.  She told me to sit anywhere.  There were 2 open tables.  They also have a patio in the front of the place where you walk in and out of the restaurant.  They have a nice selection of craft beer on tap.  More than half of the list is Ohio based craft on one side of the menu and everything else on the other side.  They have maybe 25-30 taps.  We ordered the garlic hummus.  It's served with fresh grilled pita wedges, cucumber and carrot rounds.  I'd put the hummus here in the top 3 hummus in the city.  It's that good.  The portion is huge and we took the leftover home.  I bet 4-5 adults would each get their fill from this easily.  The hummus itself is creamy, smooth, and the garlic flavor isn't spicy garlic at all.  It's roasted garlic flavor.  The pita is grilled and served warm.  The pita exterior is hot and the interior is tender.  It is sooooo good.  I ordered the regular Gyro with no tomato.  I've also had the chicken Gyro in the past.  You can't go wrong either way.  Both are outstanding.  I told my wife I always order a Gyro when I come here.  She suggested a burger or maybe the pulled pork sandwich.  I told her the Gyro is soooo good it's hard to pass that up.  Or the Greek salad with Gyro meat.  The Gyro is served on a grilled pita with what must be like 1 lb of fresh sliced Gyro meat.  The tzatziki sauce goes on top of that.  Then large slices of red onion on top of that.  It gets wrapped in foil.  Their fries are really good so I usually get those as well.    I'm sure I look like a caveman eating this thing because I pick it up and start eating.  It's hard to decide if you should pick it up or use a knife and fork.  I don't care.  I pick it up.  It was hard to hold with one hand and snap a photo with the other.  It's huge.  The tender meat is seasoned perfectly, with a nice creamy addition from the garlic spicy and tangy tzatziki sauce, followed by a crunch from the onion.  It's a perfect marriage.  The fries are always crunchy and hot.  The dill pickle is good, too.  Overall, this is a great spot.  Located in a strip close to the highway and Southpark mall (2-3 miles maybe).  Next to Royal Park Fine Wine and Beverage store.  Which is nice if you need to grab something on the way home.    Only issues I had were when I walked in and out of the place.  When I walked in it took 4 people to look at me before someone helped me.  And when I left I had to walk through a ploom of cigarette smoke to get to my car because the patio sits at the front door.  That's not enough to keep me away from this place.  The hummus and Gyro game here is strong."}
{"text":"Very disappointed had a clambake with lobster. Lobster was awful. Tail was so soft like mashed potatoes never had a lobster like that oh well not going back. They took the meal off the bill did not even offer another one. Goodbye Niko's not coming back."}
