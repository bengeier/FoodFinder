{"text":"This is a really good place to eat nice environment chicken tenders are delicious, what I would recommend is a TWC Wings you guys should try that the best and dont forget boba here!!!! Wing and boba really good~~~"}
{"text":"We had wings for lunch yesterday and they were amazing.  We got the dry rubbed garlic Parmesan ones (my favorite of the two) and the Siracha honey wings (my husband's favorite).  We chatted with the owner about starting this venture (he's formerly from a sushi background).  He's upbeat and personable.  He's perfected the wings already.  Starts with fresh (never frozen) wings...that's what makes these so good!  Haven't tried the Boba, but will on our next visit."}
{"text":"This was our first time at Crazy Mike's and it didn't disappoint!! My boyfriend had eaten here when it was Wing Counter so he came in with expectations, I did not. He ordered 10 traditional wings half TWC (their house dry rub) and half Spicy TWC with Cajun fries, I ordered honey bbq boneless wings with twister fries and we both got ranch. Everything was super fresh, nothing premade and sitting out. The ranch was also homemade and delicious! The spicy TWC was definitely spicy and according to him a little heavy but still good. The regular TWC, however, was the $#&%*@! bomb!!! It was so good I ordered additional boneless with it on them so I could have some too. The honey bbq was really good, a similar sauce to Sweet Baby Rays if that's your thing. Both the Cajun fries and twister (curly) fries were amazing. We will 100% be back!! When you walk in it looks a little deceiving... they sell boba which made me doubt that the food would be good but I was mistaken! They also sell some beer and have not only Kool-aid but alcoholic Kool-aid available!! Grape with vodka, fruit punch with vodka, and blue raspberry with tequila, we didn't try these but I might next time!"}
{"text":"Very good wings. They are big and cooked to perfection every time. Plenty of sauces to choose from. They also have Boba drinks which are good also. I've been here a few times and will be going back again and again."}
{"text":"First time here, came in with my daughter.  The staff was super awesome! I asked for their names because they deserve to get recognized.  Daniel took my order and suggested 12 wings so I could try different flavors.  He was very nice.  They are very kind about mixing flavors up unlike other places.  Ryan went above and beyond and bought sauce examples for us to try.  He had an amazing personality.  Luz is a sweetheart and helpful.  The food was amazing! The boba was on point! I can't wait to come back! If you want amazing food and a chill atmosphere this is the place!"}
{"text":"THE BEST WING IN TOWN Love their sauces!! will def come back fro wings. Owner is super friendly and fast service"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Wings spot in Peoria and surrounding area. Crazy Mike seems to be quite the character and is always happy with a smile on his face. I enjoy the breading they put on the wings because it provides a nice crunch and chicken texture and taste. The pricing is great and you can definitely get full on $10 or less. I have had great experiences both dining in and taking out. I'm not a big spice guy and my go-to's are the TWC dry rub, teriyaki, and honey BBQ. The fries are fantastic and you can't go wrong with a nice Icee or Boba to top it off. Love me some Crazy Mike's Wings!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have lived in 5 different states and we can say hands down Mike's has the best wings we have ever had. They offer great sized, fresh, quality chicken that is cooked perfectly every time. He has a great variety of sauces to choose from, I prefer the TWC dry spicy rub! He also has some great non wing options and desserts. I will keep coming back as long as he keeps making them."}
{"text":"Bomb ass wings! The spicy TWC wings are some of the best I've ever had! Highly recommend them!"}
{"text":"Great customer service great food!!! I think best wings in town!!! Try there good flavors TWC now new flavor spicy TWC. Korean hot sweet chili flavor is boom too. I really recommend you!! I will be back 1000% for sure. Thank you crazy Mike's wings"}
{"text":"Great staff. The WTC wings do not quite taste the same as when produced by wing counter however they are still delicious. I order them to go so when I got home I added a little more salt and dill."}
{"text":"These wings are delicious, cooked to perfection.  And there is always a friendly smile from Mike, the new owner.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite wing place. They get an A++++++ from me. What does A stand for?
A is for awesome wings. No stupid baked wings with soggy skin soaked in sauce to hide how bad the wings are. Their traditional bone-in wings are fried to perfection with just the right amount of crispiness on the skin and tenderness on the meat. 

A is for assortment of flavors, sides and beverages. Let's start with the wings. Traditional bone-in or boneless. They have Chicken tenders too. They have a wonderful assortment of sauces or dry rubs to choose from. If you order 10 or more wings, you can split the order into two flavors. That's what I did. I went with a dry rub of what they call their \"Crazy mikes Dry rub (TWC) and wanted to also some saucy wings. I went with the spicy teriyaki. Both were fantastic. I don't like over sauced wings. I like just enough sauce to give the wings a good coating but not drowning in sauce. That's what they do here. The sauce full of flavor. Spicy sweet teriyaki, a little sweet with a little heat. Nice! Loved it. The dry rub wings were a nice blend of herbs and spices. Loved those as well. Super crispy. Great flavor. I also ordered the garlic Parmesan fries. Wow. So good. Great flavor. The fries were slightly battered or something very light and crispy. The other side options sound great as well. Everything from poppers to onion rings and waffle fries. The beverage options are insane too. Lots of boba style drinks, smoothies, Thai iced teas, soda, kool-aid. What you smokin' crazy mike? Getting all crazy with the options! Love it!

Another \"A\" for amazing service. The staff is so friendly. One of the owners, a lovely Korean woman (my wife kept saying how beautiful she is), was so kind and friendly. Always checking with the customers to see how they enjoyed the food l. I assumed she was an owner because of her care and attentiveness to all the customers and later I asked her and she confirmed. These are the kind of local businesses I love to support. The other employees there were also very courteous and friendly. 

I can't wait to go back and try more flavors. This is my go to place for wings now, hands down. All you pizza places and restaurants serving up soggy baked wings, get the outta my face! You're a disgrace to the wings industry! All you others who are serving up dry as dirt wings with all that sauce to mask your beef jerky wings, GTFO! If you're not serving it up like crazy mike's then you need to take your wings off the menu and send them to crazy mike who knows how to properly treat a chicken wing. 

Our feathered friends have made the ultimate sacrifice so that we can sauce up their wings and eat them by the dozen. Show them some respect and cook them right. You're doing it right crazy mike! I salute you. If I were a chicken, I'd be proud to have my wings donated for your cause!"}
{"text":"Wings are awesome!  We came in to find 1 person working with quite a few people to order. Felt bad for her, thankfully her co worker came in shortly after.  We look forward to seeing Willy working, the order is always perfect."}
{"text":"Don't order the mango habanero. You'll end up getting poorly fried wings without any flavor. Or it might have been that they forgot to put sauce on the wings for our takeout order which is even more despicable. There was literally no sauce on the wings. Unfortunately for Mikes, even the Korean hot and spicy wings were not even close to being good. It left us feeling sick. The Parmesan garlic fries were nothing to be proud of either. They weren't baked in any garlic or Parmesan but rather powdered with an array of flavors which also made us nauseous. This place is nothing more than a subpar college campus wing shop. Will not be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"This spot used to be The Wing Counter, but wings are still delicious, there are a few differences, more flavors have been added and they now serve boba, which I hear is delicious. I had the wings with TWC dry rub and Korean sweet chili and seasoned fries, consistently good. The wings are crispy outside and meaty and tender inside, the fries could cook a little longer for me, but they're still good. Give this spot a try you won't regret it."}
{"text":"The dry rub and regular chicken wings were good. I did not like their house style flavor wings I think they're too salty. The service was good and lots of different flavors of chicken wings to choose from. The reason for the 3 star, being a new mom and with a 9-month-old with possible poopy diapers, it makes it really hard to enjoy this place with a baby. There are NO changing tables in their restroom. So I had to change my adorable baby boy the nasty bathroom floor. They do not have high chairs. Great place to go if you do not have babies and just a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery through seamless. 10 piece traditional wings and waffle fries.

Food was made and delivered quickly and everything was delicious. The fries were crispy and well seasoned.

The wings were crunchy on the outside and tender/juicy on the inside. For sauces, I tried the scorching and the Korean hot sweet chili. The scorching was really spicy. Good if you like that (I do) but probably too much for most people.  The sweet chili was just what you'd expect from a Korean fried chicken place.

Will definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"I am so sad that I found this place while on a business trip instead of in my home town because these were some of the best wings I have ever had. Crispy. Moist inside. Dry seasonings were on point. Perfection."}
{"text":"Was sooooo excited to eat these for the Super Bowl today, but as much as I was wanting to give them a 5 star review, they were only average, at best.  They were small.  Over-cooked.  The flavor was good.  But honestly, not impressed.  My sons words were \"you shoulda just got em at X\".   Dang it.  I wanted him to say \"good work, dad!\"  Maybe it's cause of the super bowl rush.  On a positive note, the Ranch dressing was amazing!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a coworker, and I was not disappointed. Nice cashier offs me samples of the sauces, and they were all amazing. I opted for the Korean garlic, the Korean sweet chilies, and garlic parm for my kid. They were well done, and moist. The sauces really shined in this case, and ranch dip was not needed. Def be coming back!"}
{"text":"Wow! Now this is how you do wings!
Everything was so delicious and the owner was awesome!

We had the twc wings... Omg
The honey BBQ... Omg
And the Buffalo... Omg

Sweet potato fries and season fries cooked to perfection... And the most amazing ranch!

Will Def be back for more!"}
{"text":"This place is so good, i havent tried all the flavors, but that is because they have such a variety and so far everything ive tried has been too good to not order again. The Original buffalo has a decent amount of heat to it, the korean chili is delicious and the lemon pepper rub is excellent. The fries are always crunchy and just how i like them. Staff is extremely friendly"}
{"text":"When you walk into Crazy Mikes, you are greeted with the warmest welcome you will ever receive!!! The food is done with such pride and love! Mike and his nephew ensure that every person who comes through those doors has a great experience. We enjoy eating here weekly, sometimes more than once a week, and he always says, see you next time! The wings are crispy and fresh and all the flavors are amazing! I prefer the TWC or lemon pepper and waffle fries that have a special sprinkle of dill...their blue cheese dressing is to die for!!! 

Thanks Mike, see you soon!!!"}
{"text":"We love the dry rub wings!  This was our first time in but the service was great,  the food was fresh and we will defiantly  be back!"}
{"text":"Used to be the wing counter, now crazy mikes wings. Seems like it has the same content as before but with an Asian twist, which I love! I only got a thai iced tea and it was great! I will have to try their wings next time! Already like it than what it was before!"}
{"text":"Wings are great and fresh
It seems like it isn't frozen always crispy 
Basically the owner bought the previous place and just changed the name and kept the old menu plus added new ones. Exceptionally good and have many varieties. One thing that shocked me the most was they had boba. Tried it, liked it. The workers here have great costumer service. Coming back for the wings and boba. Great combination."}
{"text":"#blessed that this isn't a far drive for me, I love wings and the flavors at Crazy Mikes  are more appealing than your commercial pizza/wing joint. I ordered Mango Habanero flavor, which had a medium kick for me, and my boyfriend ordered your average BBQ (always a favorite). Reasonable portions of meat on the bone, packed with flavor, they even serve Boba Tea! We were two very happy beings that evening."}
{"text":"Amazing wings here! My favorite and go to is the Korean sweet chili and garlic parmesan fries. The best wings and fries I've ever had. Been here a few times and quality has always been the same, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Oh, my, gosh, the chicken at this place is amazing! Their TWC dry rub is so good! They have boneless (my favorite), bone-in and tenders. There is a large array of sauces and dry rubs that you can get. The fries have a great seasoning and are really good as well. On top of the amazing chicken, they sell boba! That's right, you can get boba at a chicken place. The boba was fantastic!

The majority of the employees are just awesome. I've bee to this place about three times now and there was only one employee that seemed like he didn't want to be there. Otherwise, they go above and beyond to make sure you had a good meal with a good experience.

It's just a small shop but it packs a big punch! There is tons of parking around.

I would highly recommend everyone to try this place out. It is really good!"}
{"text":"Tried for the first time yesterday. Was not disappointed. My picky 5 year old loved the dry rub wings she couldn't get enough. The fries are very crispy. I recommend asking for less salt in the dry rub that's the only thing. And the the Korean flavor is bomb. Don't go here and get basic buffalo. They will let you sample the flavors of sauces they have which is pretty cool!"}
{"text":"The reviews are misleading. The wings are small. We got mild wings they were decent but 50 bucks for 48 wings. A dollar a wing is not a good price. One time was enough for me. I'm from Buffalo so maybe I'm a little picky about my wings."}
{"text":"I was not so excited to try Crazy Mike's wings as I figured it was the same wigs and owners as it had been for the last few years. BUT, this re-vamp or whatever the heck they did was sooooo smart. Better sauce, better wings, better service, better ideas!! I was SUPER pleased with my experience with Crazy Mikes. The Wing place it was before was similar but not as flavorful what so ever. The wings have a nice crunch, pelting of dry rubs and wing sauces to choose from. Something for every wing lover. You have to try the Korean Hot Sweet Chili. SOOOO perfect. Sweet, tangy, and a bit of spice. Crazy Mikes had done a great job and I hope they stay around forever. This place is walking distance from my house and I'm not mad about that."}
{"text":"This little place is so delicious! I had the Korean sweet hot chili boneless wings and parmesan fries and omg so much flavor. I loved that they had a Kool-Aid machine as well. It was perfect! & to top it off, the customer service was fantastic! 
The only negative thing I could say is they're a little pricey but it was totally worth it! This is my new favorite wing spot!"}
{"text":"Best wings in town!!! Come and try it!! You will love it. Great flavors TWC is number one!!"}
{"text":"Interesting menu considering the name of the place. Tried the \"mikes spicy\" rub which had great flavor but not what I would call spicy. My friend had the garlic sauce wings and said they were good as well. Beignets were tasty and a good way to end the meal."}
{"text":"I am crazy about these wings and I'm not even a chicken wing person!

Mike's used to be a different name under other ownership but has re branded and the chicken is AMAZING!! This little place is a small chicken wing shop that offers fries, Boba and other snacks. The shop has a few tables with fun and bright decor but the whole place is all about the TWC rub.

They offer wings bone in and bone out along with combos. The smallest combo comes with 4 wings and you can get a side. The seasoned fries are so flavorful and perfection. Every time you order food, it comes out piping hot. They offer a ton of different flavors, half are dry rubs and the other are sauces. You have to get the TWC because the mix of flavors is beyond any words I can describe. You get a side of either blue cheese or ranch and it's extra for another sauce. 

Lots of free parking out front and it's about time you run over hear and eat some of the best chicken wings you will ever have in your life! You're welcome."}
{"text":"I've had a taste for Buffalo wings for a few weeks. I ordered some from a pizza chain that were horrible! I ordered some from a nicer brew pub that were ok. I finally tried Mikes, which ironically is right around the corner from where we live. Holy cow! These were perfect! Meaty wings that were perfectly cooked and a hot Buffalo sauce that made my lips burn - just like I like them. My husband got chicken fingers and onion rings. The fingers were huge and the coating crispy but not greasy and the onion rings were fantastic! I will be a regular customer! Oh, and the guy who took my order was so friendly and funny! Trust me, if you like wings, give this place a try! You won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Wings are cooked fresh when you order. Good variety of sauces and rubs. TWC and lemon pepper rubs are two of my favorites. Delicious! Beer is sold in the bottle. Awesome customer service. Mike is so friendly and funny. I will return. Try it. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Found this little gem when having to go to Kohls. 

Now a family favorite! The two gentleman we always encounter are above genuine nice guys! They always remember my husband when they go for food and they strike up a conversation with him each time and it seems genuine. 

One of the few places that my oldest daughter literally cries when she realizes she is about to eat her last bite of food. Even makes sure she doesn't leave any Korean garlic on her plate."}
{"text":"Fabulous service and food! The team remembered my name even after I was done eating and serving other customers. 
The wings were nice and saucy and had great flavor! The fries were on point and can't get enough of the koolaid! 
Had a great experience! Probably some of my favorite wings!"}
{"text":"Came here based on the good reviews on yelp. The prices are a little higher that other wing places but the wings and fries tasted great! I like dry rub wings and the wings I ordered had the perfect crisp. The fries had great texture and seasoned right. The one thing I didn't like was the cashier swiping my card and asking if I wanted to leave any tip before I received any type of service. It makes the customer feel obligated to tip or else feel the awkwardness when you tell them no. Other than that, I enjoyed it here and would be back."}
{"text":"Best wing stop in the west and central valley, hands down. Crispy n' crunchy outside, hot n' juicy inside, regardless of the sauce you roll it in, regardless of how long you wait before taking a bite.
I love ordering it with the Korean garlic sauce, occasionally with hot buffalo on the side. The wait is reasonably short, and they always fry it just right. I've ordered their fries and beignets too--just as hot fluffy n crispy. If you think you've found another place that will rival Crazy Mike's, put up your dukes and let me know."}
{"text":"The worst food and service.  Waited a very long time for Tyson \"like\" frozen chicken. I could have made this meal  at home, after shopping at Costco....:("}
{"text":"Great customer service and awesome food I love wings and by far I can say the surpass wingstop and that a big comparison when it comes to wings"}
{"text":"I have come here 3 times now. I usually get the hot wings and the Korean Hot Sweet Chili with seasoned fries (a must have) with their hand made ranch. The food here is always really good and hot and the staff is always friendly. For a 10 wing meal with fries and a drink with ranch your going to spend around $15 dollars. A little pricy, they should do a wing Wednesday or something for sure. Over all very tasty."}
{"text":"The food and the service was A+. Loved the TWC seasoning and the Korean garlic sauce. I also loved the fact that you can choose your type of fries. How awesome is that?! I learned about this place after someone posted a picture of the wings and it looked amazing so I had to try them. Definitely will come back and bring more people to try it out."}
{"text":"Wow the woman at the front who takes your order is so beautiful and nice. She actually checks on you to make sure you like the food, so does the chef that makes it. They smile at you. I felt like I was in someone's home. I got a dry rub that she recommended, i forget its name but it's got three letters. It was so good, Chicken was juicy and tender and the outside was crispy and well
Flavored. I asked for waffle fries but got the regular ones instead, but oh well. They have a lot of fry options but the fries i had weren't good. Almost tasted stale, something off about them. I also got traditional buffalo wings which were pretty darn spicey!"}
{"text":"These wings are sooooo good!!! Every single time we go we love it! There are so many flavors, and the wings are always cooked perfectly. It is a small place, but definitely a staple for us."}
{"text":"crazy mikes is probably up there for wings. i got the korean spicy chilli wings combo with the waffle fries. the wings were amazing but the fries were a hit too seasoned for my liking! the cajun fries and he mango habanero ones my bf got werent that great. their boba was really good too"}
{"text":"$40 for 36 wings. Ranch has chives in it. Ugh. Wings were below average. Hate to be negative, but disappointed. Cashier said they are really good and never frozen. Really couldn't tell the difference between everywhere else we go. Just not impressed at all."}
{"text":"Their ranch is horrible, who puts dill in Ranch?! Totally ruins the whole wing experience."}
{"text":"The wings are good, the seasoning on the seasoned fries are good but the fries themselves are only ok. The ranch is very watery with almost no flavor."}
{"text":"Great wings, some of the best dry rub flavors out there! The Boba here is also really good at such a low price. I'd recommend the Taro flavor"}
{"text":"The choices for sides are awesome!!!  The hot wings here were no joke.  Then they say hot with 3 peppers next to the word hot, believe it, they are hot.   The dry rub wings are great also."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time on a recommendation from a coworker. I live in Anthem so it was a but of a drive, but it was 100% worth it. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone who likes wings. My son got chicken tenders with a side of honey bbq sauce and he loved the sauce. It was way better than any standard honey bbq and perfect for someone who doesn't like a wing sauce. Husband tried the spicy dry rub on the recommendation of Ryan who took our order even though he's not a fan of dry rubs and he loved it. All the food including the regular fries and the garlic parm fried were delicious. Friendly staff and great food, what more can you ask for? Definitely check this place o

Edit! Just came back for our 2nd visit. Just as the first time, all the food was amazing. Ryan even remembered us which was really cool. Not every day something like that happens. Hubby got the standard TWC dry rub and I even tried it too, very delicious! Definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Damn good wings.  Those fry's are amazing as well."}
{"text":"Drove from Avondale to this place to find it's no longer Wing Counter and the two young workers are incompetent. I ordered 4 meals with 2 orders of seasoned fries and 2 orders of garlic fries. The worker brought 1 seasoned fry and the other 3 garlic fries. I let him know there should be 2 of each and he was adamant he had the order correct according to his order slip. After digging in the trash to retrieve my receipt to prove him wrong he finally provided another seasoned fry. The wings were extremely dry and the garlic fries were cold. I will not waste the drive or my time at this place again! Also, any expired Groupon coupons you have for this place will not be honored...."}
{"text":"We were supposed to meet for pho but did not notice that they closed on Monday!  But we smelled Fried Chicken.  So we decided to get wings instead. We were greeted quickly as soon as we came in the menu is very easy to order from I got the 8 piece chicken wing meal with a drink and fries.  The parmesan garlic chicken wings were absolutely very good very garlicky!  And the staff checked and see if we're how we're doing as well during our meal."}
{"text":"Amazing places, the owner of this restaurant is super friendly. The chicken wings are sooooo good. Personally recommend dry hub."}
{"text":"Amazing wings. Awesome owners. Great place. I had the Thai and Korean chili, so good. The fact you can season your fries in different style, gives you more reasons to come back and get some more. Place is inexpensive, so good for those random date nights. Thank me later."}
{"text":"I walked into this place because I was hungry and didn't know if I wanted Pho or wings, I'm happy I chose here!  The service was great and the wings were out of this world, I'll definitely be adding this spot to my regular visit list!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Just moved to the area and this was one of the first places we stopped at. Ryan helped us and he was very friendly and helpful. We found our stop for wings!!"}
{"text":"Happened to stumble upon this place after searching for wing places near my work. Yet again, yelp never fails as this spot definitely hit all the main points I search for when looking for new spots: inexpensive, quick, excellent service and most importantly tasty. I had 36 wings to go as I was in a hurry to catch the football game at a buddies house. Decided to order Korean sweet chili, garlic parmesan, and the traditional hot. They offer blue cheese and ranch as there main dipping sauces. Would definitely come back and try there signature dry rub TWC as the reviews state here is there best. Crazy Mike's Wings did not disappoint and the only thing I'm not crazy about is the distance as it's quite a trek from where I currently reside."}
{"text":"Good place need atmosphere along with GOOD food! Friendly staff, fresh food and adult beverages win Win WIN"}
{"text":"Chicken wings were practically perfectly crispy. The best I've experienced so far here in Phoenix. Restaurant is small but clean. Another place where you can't wait to get some more. Staff very friendly. I went there about 3 in the afternoon, just a couple of customers however they seemed happy to be eating those wings. I ordered the dry rubbed wings with sauce on side. Everything was delicious. I would recommend you try your wings here!"}
{"text":"I arrived at noon. Does not look like anyone has been here all day. Dead inside.  I always find that scary as the food is generally terrible or spoiled. However, Staff was very polite and I requested that they suggest their favorite seasoning and topping. Did the 10 piece combo of Sirancha Honey and the dry run with fries. Little pricey and the machine asked for a tip. Damn it looks amazing and was incredible wings. Coming back again."}
{"text":"I've ordered a few times now from crazy mike's and I can say the food is so delicious!! I'm actually craving it now and will probably be making a visit very soon! The wings are delicious!! There is a large variety of rubs and sauces you can pick. I haven't had one I didn't like yet. They also have a variety of fries and sides. I've tried the seasoned fries and jalapeño poppers which are now my fav. Also! If you have a chance I would recommend eating them there when it's piping hot and fresh!"}
{"text":"The best wings in AZ! We  drive 30 minutes one way just to get them, even  after a full days work it's worth the time. Ryan is great and the crazy Mike's dry rub are worth the trip every time. We eat here at least 2 times a week."}
{"text":"Crazy Mikes has the best wings We have ever eaten. My wife and I are from the Austin, Texas area and recently visited my family many of whom live in Phoenix. The college football national championship was on the agenda for the night and my sister had bought pizza . The wife and I decided we needed some wings to go with the pizza. We had done a little research via the internet and chose to give Crazy Mikes a try. We walked in and told the gentleman we had never been there before. He proceeded to give us a Wings 101 course. He was very courteous and guaranteed we would like their wings. We even asked if they thought of expanding to Texas.We have never had wings that tasted so good. My family in Phoenix will be new customers. We can't wait to visit Crazy Mikes on our next trip to the Valley of the Sun. I guarantee you will like Crazy Mikes."}
{"text":"We started at The Wing Counter as our\" Go to Wing Service\"!!- When they changed out to Crazy Mike's Wings, it did not stop us!- Wings and service are always top- notch!.Always done the way we like, lots of sauce options too.We are within walking distance, so this place sees a lot of us. 
One note:Beignets are not like Café du Monde.
(These are a bit more cake-like) .Still good, but not what I expected.
2/21 Hey Mike, we loooove the wings , so many sauce options and the Beignets are still on my favs for every order we pickup!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent. Wings are awesome. Love the variety 
of french fries flavor. Will definitely come back.
This place is a hidden gem."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place last year and have really enjoyed the food so I just had to share my thoughts.

I am a wings fanatic, a true wing nut ;-) fried are my favorite style by far. My perfect wing would be : 1. Satisfying crunchy texture initial bite.  2. Sweet sensation of a sauce with just enough sugar without being overly sweet. 3. Spice that hits you a minute later a.k.a. backend heat. 

KOREAN HOT SWEET CHILI is possibly the best wing flavor I have had in recent memory. Fantastic sweetness with a hint of spice then a minute later BAMM!  Spiciness galore. 

Olympics are in Korea right now. How about grabbing a bite of Korea in a much nicer winter environment! Enjoy. Remember to check in for free offer!

***see my photos, not linked for some reason***"}
{"text":"I have a new place for Wings!! I love Crazy Mike. He helped us pick the correct sauce for our all flat wing order with soda and garlic Parmesan French fries. 
This place is clean and oh so friendly. I'm a wing counasour and this is on my top 3 favorite places the get my wing fix. The menu is full of fried goodies and a variety of beverages including beer which my daughter throughly enjoyed. If you have late night munchies before 9pm come visit Crazy Mike's Wings! They will take good care of you."}
{"text":"You absolutely cannot go wrong with wings from these guys. Sauces are delicious and the wings are nice and crispy. Awesome customer service and delicious food, what more can you ask for!"}
{"text":"OK let just say that the search for the perfect wings is a constant for me.  I have searched high and low in this town and I believe I have found my wing joint.  So many places either under cook, over sauce or under sauce their wings.  This places hits the right combination on all accounts.  The selection of sauces was a welcome exchange as well (honey sriracha please)."}
{"text":"They took over the location of wingstop and made it their own.  Out of a 5 rating, 5 being high...wingstop= 1, crazy mikes =4.  Crispy wings with a great flavor selection.   
We had Thai, garlic parm, and the recommended dry rub.  They bursts with flavor. Would have liked a little more on the garlic parm as it did not cover the whole wing. 
Crazy mikes flavors and service are so far ahead.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Oh lord this place was good. We got two meals with the wings and fries and a drink it was about $40 so on the pricier side but definitely worth it. The two guys working were super helpful and friendly, they made the experience of going here."}
{"text":"What a great find ! They have a big selection of wing flavors which I really liked. Their wings came out crispy and delicious! We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Ok so last night we were craving wings and wanted to try something new so we went to crazy mikes. The guy that was working there could tell we hadn't been in before so we went over the menu which was something we weren't expecting. Then we were indecisive about which wing flavor we wanted, the employee suggested the Korean sweet chili and asked if we wanted to try the sauce. After one small spoon of the sauce we fell in love and ordered a 10 piece. We were just going to get wings but he also sold us on getting some beer and potstickers. The employees there probably aren't responsible for sales but they were excellent at selling the food. We were going to spend $11 and we ended up spending $24. Also you get to watch them make your food too so you know it's fresh. The Korean sweet chili were insanely good! Will be going back and want to give huge kudos for the two employees they went above and beyond and even asked us how we liked everything. The owner should be insanely proud to have such outstanding employees"}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about this place and finally had the chance to try it tonight and I was not disappointed! The gentleman at the register was extremely patient and helped me decide what I wanted because they have so many great choices, he even let me sample a few different flavors to help me make a better choice.  I ended up with  6 of the \"Korean garlic\"  and 6 of the \"pineapple habanero\" bone-in wings that were amazing, they were fried to perfection with a lot of juicy meat on each one. I also got a side of the \"seasoned fries\" and a side of the \"calamari\" which were both tasty and came with homemade ranch on the side which was a huge plus. I was unfortunately too full to try any of their deserts, which all looked amazing as well! I will defiantly be back."}
{"text":"Great wings and great boba smoothies! One of my favorite places to get wings from! Wings are savory and sauce is tasty! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"We are visiting from CO and we were craving some wings. Made the trip from our hotel and we were not disappointed. Great wings and fries! Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Try try try the spicy dry rub! The perfect amount of spice and flavor to a perfect chicken wing. The rub is made in house and its incredibly delicious! my son and I came in for a father son afternoon snack and we enjoyed the wonderful customer service and food. The fries we seasoned to perfection which complimented the meal to completion. I will be returning again for some more of those spicy dry rub wing!"}
{"text":"So recommended to me by a fellow yelper Drake Thompson and this place is so bomb it's amazing and so delicious. Super kind and awesome staff and keep in mind I traveled from Gilbert to come here well worth the drive. Best wings and the best fries by far"}
{"text":"Ordered my next meal through Grub Hub (yes I did redeem my coupon from my last visit!).  I had entered in a special request in my order and after submission, someone from Crazy Mike's called to talk about it.  He didn't give his name but I'm pretty sure it was Mike but he was as sweet as can be!  He just wanted clarification on the request and he said that it was going to be no problem.  Food arrived to my house within 30 minutes.  Everything I ordered was there and special request was done perfectly.

Thank you for another amazing meal!"}
{"text":"Super good. 
I tried the Korean chili, siracha, and scorching. I wasn't a fan of the siracha, my husband liked it though.
They warned us about scorching, but since I'm a fan of chicken wings and have been to a ton of places always getting the spicest, we told them we could handle it. I could only handle 2 wings. Lol. It is by far the spicest wing I've ever eaten, it was crazy.
I wasn't a fan of the onion rings either (thought they needed to be crispier), but my husband and father loved them. 
The garlic fries were delicious and the mozzarella sticks. 
Also got a cookie, super soft. Whenever I'm back in Arizona, I'd love to come and eat here again. My only complaint is that I had to clean off my own table."}
{"text":"Some of the best wings I've had. I've waited until I tried the dry rub wings, to review, and all 3 visits have been awesome and the wings are by far the best in the Valley to me. Ever since moving from Alabama, I've been trying to find a legit wing place, which this definitely fits the bill. I highly recommend. And if you need heat, they have spicy wings that are so hot you'll be looking for something to drink or some bread immediately. Too too good! My favorite are the honey sriracha wings though. The Cajun and Curry fries hit the spot as well, and they have the perfect blend of spice and flavor, to complement the wings. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I have wanted to eat here when it was the previous place (The Wing Counter) it must of recently changed but decided to still try it. I ordered 6 wings for $6.75 and got the Korean Garlic. My son got the Original Buffalo. We loved both! The wings are crispy and meaty. Ordered carrots & celery for $1.00 and you get a lot and they are cold & crisp/fresh!! Ranch dipping sauce is good too. Love that they serve kool aide and even some with alcohol. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Gotta love Crazy Mike's Wings. Great customer service, super clean, and awesome wings. Come crispy right out of the fryer and there are great sauces and dry rubs. Mike's Spicy rub is killer and I highly recommend it. 

Pro tip. Bring a date and ask them to turn on some slow jams."}
{"text":"I see all the reviews about how great the wings are at Crazy Mike's but unfortunately we were not able to find out. We placed a phone order that they said would be ready in about 15 to 20 minutes. When we arrived there were about 4 people in line. We waited for nearly 30 minutes in line watching as not one person's order was ready or correct. It was chaotic, unorganized and totally unclear who was in charge. We tried to be patient because it was Super Bowl day and we honestly thought our order was ready and waiting. However, that was not the case. Not only was our order not ready but we were told \"the boys had not taken more chicken out and did we want to wait or come back?\" I said absolutely not. This is our first and last time. They offered to give us a 5% discount. I said it wasn't about the money and we walked out...with a line of people out the door. 
I can be forgiving in a situation like this but while we waited in line we watched the cashier make paying customers standing in front of her wait while answered the phone and took more orders when they clearly couldn't handle the ones they already had. We also watched a young man walk to head of the line and ask his friend who was working if he could get something. Luckily the employee said no or there might have been a few people whose heads would have exploded...especially mine.
To be fair, Jeanie called me later in the day and really tried to make up for it by offering us 24 free wings. I explained to her that we would not be taking her up on it. 
There are too many great restaurants in this valley to ever waste my time returning to a place that can't take out enough chicken to be prepared to handle a Super Bowl crowd. Its the one thing you have to make and you failed. 
I'm sure Mike is a nice guy and things might have been different had he been there but we'll never know."}
{"text":"Korean chili sauce wings.. yum! Parm fries were also pretty good & crispy. Friendly & quick service is always a huge plus."}
{"text":"THAT BOY MIKE CRAZY

It's ya boy, X from Glendale back with another one. This time I tried this spot Crazy Mike's Wings. 

The wings were fire. I've had my share of wings before but yo these wings are big. The one I'm holding in my pic looked like the chicken was on steroids or somethin'. That thing was weighing me down and I aint the smallest chicken in the coop. But either way they crispy, tasty, and definitely get my approval. I fxx with the Honey BBQ one heavy, but the crazy mike's rub is good too. BEWARE the Spicy mikes rub is HOT. That one is hotter than Megan Fox in a bikini if you know what I mean. But they got the kool aid to ease the pain a lil. 

The only complaint I got is the pricing. If you order 8 wings or 12 or 24, the price per wing is the same. That makes no sense and it should be cheaper if you order more wings. Mike crazy but he got no common sense at the same time. 

But you know what they say, if you like it put a wing on it. Ima put a wing on it and I'll be back for sure

{"text":"This one makes me sad to write. Are used to love this place when it was Wing counter. The sauce was bomb, the wings were nice and tender and the staff was so friendly and talkative. But now you can tell it's under new management and the wings don't taste the same. I ordered the garlic Parm wings which I generally love I tried the dry rub in the sauce both were not my thing. I could barley finish 6 wings of it. The staff is still pretty nice but it's not the same.I guess I got to find a new wing place"}
{"text":"If i could give 0 star i would.  This place used to be my favorite wings spot but since they changed ownership is been worse and worse every time.  Customer service sticks food sucks, definitely check your order when you receive delivery"}
{"text":"Best Wings hands down. Always hot and fresh!! I love the seasoned fries and the ranch dressing! My favorite flavors are TWC and Garlic Parm Dry Rub. They're So good I have to hide the leftovers from my family if there's even any left over that is!! Staff is always nice. Ryan always makes sure we're taking care of!"}
{"text":"Been here several times, alone or with family. This place is great each and every visit. 
The wings here never disappoint. I've tried so many flavors, but not all... so I can't pick a favorite just yet. The Lemon Pepper and Korean Sweet Chili are at the top of my fave list. Also love their great selection of fries. My favorite are the curry fries. I think next time I'll ask for exxxxxtra curry, only because I can't get enough of that flavor & aroma. So good! Nice assortment of beverages including sodas, Kool-aid and beers. 
Yesterday I went in near closing time and was assisted by two of the coolest guys one could ask for. Armein and Dustin. From the moment I called over the phone to my in-person pick-up (though I winded up eating in), they were friendly, helpful and just really pleasant. My concern was it was about 8:25, they closed at 9. They both assured me no worries, relax, take your time, etc... which was really refreshing. Armein mentioned his favorite wing flavor (TWC) and based off that and other Yelp reviews, it's next on my list to try. 
I highly recommend this place- great food, great service. Way to go, guys!"}
{"text":"Super delicious! Staff is very helpful. We loved the lemon pepper rub- they are known for their rubs. The parmesan garlic and mango habanero wings were really good as well. The ranch has like dill in it. Sooo tasty! Two thumbs up on the pricing as well! We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is under new ownership, it used to be called the wing counter, the wings are very good and always prepared the way I like them, the place is very clean including the bathrooms. I really don't care what the call the place as long as they stay in business"}
{"text":"This place is great!  They also have other items on the menu along with boba.  The wings were big, crunchy and juicy on the inside.  I'm glad I ran into this place and we will definitely be back to try the other flavors."}
{"text":"great customer service, im not a fan of their wings but i only tried two of them and im not that big of a wings kind of person. Customer service was top notch though."}
