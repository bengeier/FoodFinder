{"text":"My first time trying chiu chow food was at this restaurant. It's close to home and convenient for me.

I found the food to be delicious and had this recommended to me by family friends. I got take out last time, but I'll probably try dine in next time.

BTW, I've been to Dynasty Cuisine in the Markham region and their set meals were amazing. I found this deal on HungryBuy.com:

{"text":"I would not even give a star cuz this is the worst Chiu Chau restaurant I have tried in my life. Food was terrible. It didn't even meet the Chiu Chau standard. The tofu tasted sour it probably turned bad. The soup we ordered was super spicy to a point that I got choked! It's not drinkable. Poor customer service from the waiter and waitress! I have black listed this restaurant and will never come back again."}
{"text":"Went out couple time for lunch, was not really impressed, one time I ordered fish and the fish was not fresh! However the fried rice and the noodle was delicious. They have a lot of varieties of Cantonese food. Really good price, service was ok, however if you don't speak Cantonese/Mandarin, you will find a difficult time to put an order."}
{"text":"This is a great late night dinner place. Whenever I arrive late to Toronto and looking for a place to eat, this is my go to place. I love the pigs blood made here. It's better than the way it's made in New York. The pigs blood is nice and smooth. I also enjoy the pigs intestine, clams, and chicken here. They all had great flavor.  I've had many other dishes here but can't remember what they're called. I tend to just look at the menu and see what's different and something I can't get back in New York. This is one of my favorite Chinese restaurant in Toronto."}
{"text":"Came here with my rents cause they actually heard from their friends that it's pretty good. I was kinda skeptical at first cause I was thinking...okay it's probably just another Asian restaurant. But oh damn their food is amazing!! I really liked the dish that looks like pancakes but it's made from eggs with little tiny clams mixed in. And oh yea... It wasn't greasy at all. I hate greasy food."}
{"text":"Yeah, I've visited this place a lot over the years. It's always been a fairly standard, solid restaurant.

Most recently, however, I had a pretty terrible experience that makes me not want to go back. For one, my fatty pork and yam dish had gone bad. As a whole, nothing seemed fresh at all. The fish was overcooked. The seaweed and tofu soup must have had four pieces of seaweed in it for a 7 person party. And while dishes being at least a bit oily is sometimes normal with Chinese cooking, I probably had enough oil to make a small fire with. The one thing I particularly enjoyed was the pork intestine, but not everyone can stomach the thought of eating that in general.  

The place was fairly empty throughout the service even though it was the prime time of the evening on the weekend. I think I know why, too. Do you?

As usual, a full review with all the pictures is up on my food blog, located conveniently in my profile. Check it out! Cheers."}
{"text":"My Wife and I decided to check this place out for an early lunch on Saturday 12/17/2016.  The place wasn't packed yet.

We ordered pork and oyster congee.  we were kinda shocked it didn't look like the congee we have enjoyed in other restos like congee queen and congee town.  It looked like soup with the rice from a rice cooker thrown into it.  Wasn't very flavorful at all, we were kinda famished so..we kinda forced it down.

we also ordered seafood chiu chow flat rice noodles.  This was ok for the most part, flavor seemed like a milder version of singapore style vermicelli noodles.  Seafood noodles?  the only seafood visible in this dish was shrimp.  All least add in some calamari or scallops considering the price paid.

upon walking in the staff appeared not so friendly.  the english of the staff was also very poor.

Likely not going for a repeat visit."}
{"text":"I came here on a craving and it was great . We had the Chiu chow congee with fish and 1/2 a duck! Delicious!! Is well worth coming here. Although it looks like it's a little sketchy but isn't all late night eateries sketchy lol"}
{"text":"A good place to have Chiu Chow style food if you are searching for an alternative to the \"usual\" Cantonese places. 

These dishes are good when you want something light / lightly seasoned: 

Bean Curd and Plum Soup (#7 in takeout menu) - tastes like a very light version of tom yum soup, non spicy 

CC style stir fried fish noodles (yes, noodles made from minced and seasoned fish meat, they look like udon noodles, taste fish-y in a good way) 

Kang Kong Malaysian style or Chinese style with bean sauce, yum! 

Stir fried bean sprouts with minced fish, sounds strange but a tasteful combination 

I also like CC style marinated dishes (app dishes), beef or beef tongue or squid. 

Give it a try if you want something different."}
{"text":"When I want speed and delicious food, I think of this place. It's definitely one step up from other restaurants in its category. The dishes aren't as large as I'm used to, but it was enough for our party. We ordered 10 dishes for 14 people and that was just perfect. For those who are used to the larger dishes at chinese restaurants it may not be enough. I particularly liked the salty hand shredded chicken. I will definitely come back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"My favorite place out of all places in the GTA.

Always yummy. Pan fried fish, seafood fried rice. The service. Dry chilli chicken, crab n corn soup spicy.

5 star for the food only.

One of my most favorite places. Good service only wish they take debit/credit oh well most Asian spots in the GTA only accept cash."}
{"text":"Second Chiu Chow cuisine restaurant that I've visited in Toronto.  We always go here at the suggestion of my uncle and he normally does the ordering.  He usually orders the following:
Fish Maw Soup (yummy)
Some sort of chicken & deep fried kale concoction
Fish Noodles (the actual noodles are made from fish paste, very tasty, though some may not enjoy the texture)
Deep Fried Tofu

For dessert:
Crystal Buns (Custard, red bean & lotus flavours) - VERY yummy! My favourite is the custard flavour.

The food here is pretty good, though if I had to compare Chiu Chow Boy vs. Ming Lou, Ming Lou wins in my books."}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of two restaurants to serve authentic Chiuchow cuisine in Scarborough.  If you like Chiuchow food and know what to order, this is the place to be."}
{"text":"I seldom sample Teochew food so this was a treat for me. It was 1:00 am and the place was pretty packed. Super loud and for some reason I really enjoyed the environment. Service was fast, servers friendly/attentive, and the food was delicious. $6.50 for a plate, not big and definitely not small. A great place to snack during a late night. We had 5 dishes

1. Pig ear - 3/5 - definitely not my thing but appreciate the chewiness 
2. Fried turnip cake - 5/5 - my absolute fave! I eat this a lot when I go dim sum-ing but this was a bit different. A friend told me they deep fry the turnip cake. 
3. Leek dumplings - 4/5 - very delicious but not sure this is the best value for your buck.
4. Peanuts with marinated pork - 3/5 - this has potential but the meat was SO freakin' salty. I felt more and more thirsty after each bite. Owner mentioned this needs to be served with congee. Pass. 
5. Fake turnip cake with egg - 4/5 - I initially thought this was turnip cake until a friend mentioned this is NOT turnip cake but some type of flour. Hmmm. Like the egg combo though.

Edit: typo"}
{"text":"Like any other restaurant that opens late, don't expect quality of the food and service to be all that great. Waiters aren't alert. You literally have to scream across the room to get their attention. Only go here because other places are all closed."}
{"text":"Not bad, very different for a typical Chinese cuisine.  The best way to describe it would be that it has a lot cleaner palette in that less grease and sauce and more herb-ier.  I quite enjoyed it especially the tofu dishes but on the fence about the fried rice and duck.  It's possible that I've gotten used to the Cantonese and Canadianized Chinese food in town. 

Food: 3/5, a lot of soy sauce based dishes. We got the duck, noodles, deep fried meatballs, Chinese vegetables and beef/chicken dishes.  Most were good but none that were spectacular.

Service: 2.5/5, typical service for a Chinese restaurant where all they do is bring the food and take the bill lol.  

Ambience: 3/5, nice little place with great tables but the seats weren't too comfortable.  It's ok.

Price: 4/5, super cheap food, for like 8 dishes, we paid less than $15 per person with a generous tip.

I would try again."}
{"text":"Chui chow is a distinct form of Chinese cuisine. One I grew up loving because it was something different and I had my favourites. The prawn and wu-tao spring rolls. The classic oyster omelette with sour dipping sauce. The steamed flat fish. The stir fried chicken and flashed spinach. Amazing stuff.

Chui chow boy makes an attempt at it but falls way short. The amount of salt in some preparations could induce a coma and the quality and preparation in medicore at best. They can't even get the rice done right. Inexcusable. 

I'm still searching for good chui chow in the GTA because I miss it. This place is cheap but doesn't do it justice. Anyone have any other suggestions?"}
{"text":"Very interesting Southern Chinese Cuisine. A good place to go if you like to try something different."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, but greasy if you like the traditional Americanized Asian infused cuisine. The service can be hit or miss, because some staff do not fluently speak English. There is a lot of variety, and I would highly recommend their Chili chicken. The portion sizes are small for the prices they charge."}
{"text":"My favourite is the salty fish chicken fried rice. Though we didn't really taste the salty fish, the rice was well done. Second favourite is the pork belly, it was so good. The other dishes I could only say ok. Don't order the hot pot tofu, no flavour and it's gross."}
{"text":"This is a no frills Chiu Chow restaurant and it's good. Don't think healthy food, just a simple family restaurant with the usual rude Asian Restaurant service.
This place is a go to because it's open very late and everything tastes darn good.
Our group of 3 ordered the \"salty vegetable pork stomach soup\", a fried mixed platter and \"Morning Glory\" which were all large portions.
The soup was a highlight as it is hard to find authentic peppery pork stomach soup in TO. The soup was very pepper spicy and filled with pork stomach and salty vegetables. 
The Fried Mixed Platter consisted of a mix of squid, shrimp paste, squid paste, peanuts, spring rolls and tofu.
Definitely a consistent spot by only if I'm feeling like some oily food."}
{"text":"One of my best friends from high school was Chiu Chow and I used to hang around her house before dinnertime. Her mum always knew what was on my mind and would simply say:

\"If you want to stay for dinner, call your mum and let her know.\"

Now that I'm a mother myself, I wonder if my mother had prepared food for me and was disappointed that I didn't come home..... sorry, Mom. 

Long story short, I grew up trying to mooch Chiu Chow food from my friend's house. And occasionally, I get a craving for it. The other day, dumplings made of fish skin and pork were calling my name, as was the brined duck. I went to this restaurant for take out and immediately remembered why I NEVER eat-in there. The place always stinks of strong bleach or cheap cleaning solution. Gives me asthma and ruins my appetite. The waitresses are never very friendly so I don't bother to suggest that they change cleaning solution. Maybe she's irritable because she has to inhale all day and it affects her brain.

The fish-skin dumplings were satisfying, as usual. The brined duck was pretty good too. Of course, I had to have my favourite Chiu Chow dessert: mashed taro with ginkgo nuts."}
{"text":"Been here more then a few times, this place has been around for years!

Great place to have some Chinese food!
Recently been back twice..

The hand shredded chicken, marinated duck and tofu is really good!

Domestic Beer: $3/ bottle!!!

Overall, price is right, food is good, open late, great place to meet up with friends to eat dinner and then chill with $3 beers."}
{"text":"I would give this place a 3.5 rating.
I've been here multiple times but the last time I paid a visit it wasn't as good as I remembered it to be.
We ordered one of their set meals for dinner.
Their \"hand pulled chicken' and \"lo sui duck\" is a very popular item here.
I love the hand pulled chicken! By hand pulled, it means all the chicken meat is pulled manually by the chef so the chicken is served boneless, with the meat all marinated and ready to eat. It was marinated slightly on the saltier side though."}
{"text":"My local T.O friend took me out to Chui Chow Boy.  I am not too familiar with this particular region of China's cuisine, but I thought the food was okay.  I liked one of their stews the best out of the numerous dishes that was ordered."}
{"text":"I initially heard about this place from someone I met at the Samosa Factory in Albion who raved about this restaurant and said I should check it out if I'm ever in the Scarborough/Markham area; letting me know this was the best place in town for Hakka style street food. When I got to the door I was impressed with their Top 100 restaurant listings from 2012-2015! However, I don't know if this is a Top 100 list they created themselves.

From the moment I stepped into this place, I had a feeling I was going to regret it. Prior to arriving at this restaurant, I read reviews about not having too many expectations where the service was concerned; but I was so disappointed with the food and the lack of service that I strike this place of my list completely. Save your money and go somewhere else, there are a plethora of options that are in the area that will not only provide much better quality, taste, quantity and value. 

While the interior is sleek and dining area is spacious, the food left much to be desired and the waitress' attitude and general demeanor was one of the worst I have ever seen in the service industry. She grunted as her only form of communication throughout the dinner even though I knew she spoke English. I tried to be over polite and nice thinking possibly she had a bad day and sometimes, you can turn a person's day around (you'd think) but nothing moved this ice princess! I don't know if I just caught her on a bad day or this is how they treat or respond to customers in general but it ruins your restaurant experience when you feel like they are doing you a favor rather than appreciating your business. She seemed to getting annoyed with customers walking into the place like she didn't want to be there, most other establishments you see just the opposite and it rings higher tips in the end for them. 

This place is more Chinese/Asian traditional cuisine than Hakka although it does have some fusions with the spices but this place is definitely one of the worst Chinese styled trying Hakka dishes for the local crowds. I'm glad we ordered a trial of just two dishes and ended our misery."}
{"text":"I have been to Chiu Chow Boy numerous time over the years. 

Good for quick lunch or late night since it opens way passed midnight. Great for a midnight snack. Chiu Chow Style congee is easy on the digestive system and great to eat before bed time.

Marinated item: duck, octopus, sausage, duck feet, tofu goes well with congee. And of course, one can order other stir fried items.

Oysters and Minced Pork Congee ($8.99) was fresh and tasty but took a while to be served.

Great neighbourhood restaurant."}
{"text":"I have been here countless times; I can't believe I haven't written a review for it until now. Chiu Chow Boy is a great place for a cosy lunch or dinner (especially dinner). The food is fully cooked (aka beautifully overcooked; no chance of sami here).  Everything is rich in flavor and slightly greasy or too greasy subject to your tolerance level (I am making a face while I am writing this).  They taste great, too.  The portion is large for its price.  I love ordering from its regular menu where there are many dinner dishes under $8.  It is literally food court pricing.  If you order stir fried rice or noodle for lunch or dinner, be prepared for a huge pile on plate.  Though I have not tried it, many people order its hot pot. I wonder how Chiu Chow hot pot is like. :-)

The restaurant is LLBO licensed.  The services are friendly and effective.

Overall, a solid 3.5 stars.  I will return, many times."}
{"text":"Came here with a few friends for dinner, it was pretty late and as we were in the area we decided to try the place out as it was still open. 

The food? Uhm, yeah never coming back here again. I've been to so many Chinese restaurants in Scarborough, and this one was probably one of the worst.. we got their fried rice, which was okay (even though we asked for spicy, it was not spicy at all), the chilli chicken, which was DISGUSTING.. it literally tasted like squid (disgusting because it was \"chicken\") and I didn't want to take another bite. We ordered dry shrimp, however, she brang chilli shrimp with gravy? As we told the waitress, she just started going on about how we ordered this, and we just gave up. We ended up eating it, and thank god we kept it, probably the best dish we got that night!

The service was okay, the waiters were attentive, however they could be a bit more friendly."}
{"text":"Overall - Food was good, but the wait was brutal. 

the place has a very herbal alcoholy smell... this is probably from the drunken chicken hotpot which a lot of tables were ordering. 

the food has never really failed here.  however, getting a table was hard.  Its hard for me to complain about the situation but basically we were waiting for a long time.. and people who came after us got tables before us.  albeit, they were very elderly people. Out of respect, i didnt want to complain."}
