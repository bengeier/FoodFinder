{"text":"Food was great, service was great, food was cheap. Eggs benedict and bacon and eggs came to $19. Tea or coffee included with all breakfast dishes. I have only tried breakfast but i will be back to try dinner soon."}
{"text":"Great meal. This was the third time we spent time at this restaurant and once again we were impressed with our dishes.  I had the penne carbonara and my partner had the curry of the day which was chicken.  Both meals we delicious.  I was surprised that there were not more people at the restaurant, but I think it is one of the best kept secrets of Ajax.  The presentation was great and the service was excellent.  I am looking forward to our next visit to Westneys."}

My wife and I used to be semi-regulars at this place. We went once or twice a week. The food was good and the prices of the specials was decent. Honestly, though, I did not always look at the bill as closely as I should.

I realized that despite the fact that an all-day breakfast is advertised as $5.99 on the sign that is outside the restaurant, I was being charged more. I was being charged $6.99 for breakfast AND I was charged $1.49 extra for coffee. The sign, as you can see for yourself, is 3 eggs, bacon/ham/sausage, homefries, toast & tea/coffee for $5.99. No time restrictions.

My $5.99 breakfast was costing me $8.48!

So the next time we went in, I drew this to their attention. They said that was before 11:00 am. (This happened in the afternoon. Their menu has an every day breakfast item for $5.99, before noon) I demanded that they honour their advertising. Staff check with manager and they said they would do it this time. When the bill came, I was charged $5.99 for the breakfasts, plus charged extra for coffee.

I went in a few days ago. I asked for the all-day breakfast advertised on the sign. I was told that they let us have it last time, but that was it. No more. I told staff that I was leaving unless they honoured the price. They refused. I was given a whole song-and-dance explanation about how they have been informing all of their customers about the increasing price of bacon and tomatoes, blah, blah, blah. I told them they could solve the problem by removing the sign. No, they said, it's the only sign they have - they can't remove it! 

A) It's not the only sign they have.
B) That sign is advertising only one thing - and it's something they won't sell you.

Three days later now - the sign is still there. BTW, this is not some permanent kind of sign. It's a sandwich board that keeps getting blown over in the wind and they keep putting it back up.

I told them that I would spread the word about this. They said that they hoped that I wouldn't.

This business draws people in with false advertising. Their most prominently-advertised feature is something that you can't get there. If you order it, they will overcharge you.

Please don't support this dishonest and untrustworthy business."}
