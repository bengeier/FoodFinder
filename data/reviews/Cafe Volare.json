{"text":"Had lunch there with a couple of co-workers and ordered the lasagna which was the daily special. To put it in a word - amazing! The bolognese sauce was the perfect combination of sweet and savory, the (what I'm assuming were homemade) noodles were perfectly done and were layered with just the right amount of cheese. The service staff, a young brother-sister duo, are very friendly and genuine in their care for the customers. This was far and away the best lasagna I've had in years and I will definitely be returning soon!"}
{"text":"My office is a 6 minute walk away which is convenient. That they deliver makes it more convenient.  With fast food being the only options for breakfast or lunch in this area...I order from here quite a bit. I have ZERO complaints about the food or service...and I am very picky about where I eat, convenient or not. 

I especially enjoy their bacon & egg breakfast. The bacon comes out the way I like it: cooked. Its not greasy nor does it have uncooked edges like most places. That I can order breakfast as late as 11am is fine with me."}
{"text":"great food and really good service, kinda tucked away of Hacienda St but worth the drive"}
{"text":"I am Italian born and raise and I know if a place is authentic ... I am very picky on food and this is for sure my new favorite Italian spot in Las Vegas... for business lunch and when I am not in a mood for cooking myself... :) I love It 

Have the best Cappuccino ... ask to make u the honey flower : ) 

I will be back here for more... bringing all my American friends that try to convince me that Olive Garden was an Italian restaurant... 

Love Caffe Volare...."}
{"text":"Very Good! Super close to my office and service was great and fast. The side salad is like a whole other meal. Looks like I will definitely be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"I was tired of the same old lunch options. I searched for a new idea and Yelp led me to Cafe Volare. It's bright Italian cafe in a industrial business park that specializes in breakfast and lunch. My first visit I had the Classic Panini ($8.95) with roasted potatoes. I preferred classic with ham, arugula and cheese to the Caprese ($7.95). Subtle difference, but I like the addition of ham next time I'll upgrade to prosciutto. These paninis remind me of those I had in Italy. They are simple, fresh and tasty. The roasted potatoes are rich with rosemary flavor and satisfying. I'm yet to try breakfast or pasta. Maybe next time?"}
{"text":"I love Cafe Volare!

Adorable little cafe with great food and quaint atmosphere and feel.  

I had the prosciutto sandwich with the soup of the day (vegetable puree) and both were fantastic.  My mother ordered breakfast - the eggs were perfectly scrambled, rosemary potatoes were very tasty, and the pancakes were delicious. 

This is the perfect breakfast / lunch spot, and I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Great change from all of the buffets! Small cafe with great service and delicious food. Get a canoli."}
{"text":"Presentation is everything and when it comes cafe volare, this is only part of the story. The food is amazing!  Not only good but in generous quantities.  The service is quick and highly professional and the atmosphere is peaceful. You enjoy your food making it quite a culinary experience"}
{"text":"Holy mother of delicious pitas! Had the chicken pita today with a side of rosemary potatoes: I already want another order! The meat was marinated and had a wonderful flavor. The pita bread was soft and fresh. Went with the potatoes (Fresh cut) -- they were crispy and delicious, and  the rosemary was not overpowering, yet very flavorful. (Avoided the frozen french fries). The smell wafting out of the door was yummy! Friendly wait staff too. Now, if we could just get businesses to STOP using styrofoam!  But I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I ordered take-out from this place during my lunch break. I got my order a few minutes after ordering...and when I got back to my office, I had someone else's order! Of course, I called to let the staff at the restaurant know I was given the wrong food and was on my way back. Once I got there, all I got was \"sorry\" from the guys that worked there. 

Needless to say, the food was actually pretty good. I had a Caprese panini which was amazing and it was such a big portion that I only ate half of it. I also had the Rosemary roasted potatoes which tasted good, but were drenched in oil. 

 I'll probably go back to this place eventually, but might dine-in next time and maybe I'll skip the potatoes."}
{"text":"For a neighborhood with not a lot of healthy options, this place has a very good salad selection. Good place for a business lunch if you are in the area. Notice it is a small cafe so the service can be slightly slow. The one time they didn't get my order right they fixed it and apologized."}
{"text":"I order here for delivery about 3 to 4 times a week. Delicious sandwiches. GREAT cappuccino!!  Super fast delivery.  Just relocated to Vegas from NYC, so pretty spoiled in the food department. It's been a challenge to find a place for a quick lunch where the food is GOOD. This is it!! 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Not many options for food in this industrial area. Skinnyfats is closer to my office and a favorite of mine, never the less I like to give everyone a try. 

Service was good, menu options were extensive and food was prepared in the right amount of time...... Once the food was given to me the portions size was good... Food quality was weak in comparison to the pricing. I had the grilled chicken panini, the chicken was over cooked, the bread wasn't crisped up like expected from a sandwich press and the flavor was lacking something and side of rosemary potatoes...amazingness but not enough to bring me back... Two stars are mostly because the kid behind the counter seemed to really enjoyed this job and business and the potatoes."}
{"text":"Great Chai Latte, and the ham and mozzarella omelet with rosemary potatoes was perfect.  As if my mom had made it.  Nothing over the top, not underwhelming, just right.  The decor is cute and fitting, and the staff was attentive and knowledgeable.  My only complaint (which took off a star) and this could be a deal breaker, is they had Fox News on the TV.  Like nails on a chalkboard when you're trying to enjoy something.  If this is how it always is I won't be back, however, I'll go again and find out.  Just put on a standard news and let me enjoy my meal.  I don't want to listen to those people while I eat.  Once that is fixed I'd happily bump this to a 5 star review."}
{"text":"This is a cute little Italian cafe. The coffee and espresso is superb!! I love  the sandwiches and the ravioli with the pink sauce is amazing. This  cafe is hidden in a business plaza and it was hard to find at first. It was worth it!! Love finding little authentic cafes in Vegas like this!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I absolutely love this restaurant.  We stumbled across it one day when we were in the neighborhood and now it is part of our  tradition.  The staff is kind and efficient as you would expect from a family owned establishment.  The food is amazing and we have never been disappointed with the specials.  We signed up for their newsletter and look forward to receiving it each day.  Not only does it pass on info about menu items, but the descriptions and research are impeccable.  As a small business owner myself I am thoroughly impressed with the product and customer service!"}
{"text":"This place was my home away from home on vacation. While staying at the The Orleans I tried their coffee house in the casino. Needless to say it was not what I consider a good cup of coffee. Luckily I did a bit of research before leaving and found this little place named Cafe Volare here on yelp about 1/2 a mile away. And man was I glad I did.

This place has GREAT Espresso, GREAT breakfast, GREAT atmosphere, GREAT service, not to mention free wi-fi. There was not one thing I disliked about this place. The rosemary potatoes, pancakes, french toast, and wraps were all so good. Just a great breakfast cafe. A great start to my family and I's day every morning. Never got to try any pasta myself. I can not recommend this place enough. I loved it. Thank you Cafe Volare!:)"}
{"text":"This is what independently produced sammi/cafe food should always be like:  Fresh, full of character, and great flavors.  Great sammi selection and some really killer soup.  The place was JAM packed and tons of take-out/phone orders coming in.  While we were there the in house crowd was close to 30 and they were banging it out with 1 front of house and 2 in the kitchen.  Bustin' some serious ass!  My ONLY knock was the sammi could use a little sauce (roast garlic aioli or basil mayo or something).  The server/hostess/cashier/I'm assuming boss said she'd try to put something together for next time.  They had mayo, just no gourmet to complete an otherwise outstanding meal."}
{"text":"I have been a regular for over 3 years, eating lunch at least twice a week.  Fresh lentil soup, pasta e faggioli, homemade lasagna with a creamy bechamel, and chicken picatta, all have been delicious examples of lunches which reminded me of what my mom used to make. I LOVED this place and considered myself so fortunate to have such a gem close to work.  All this changed recently as they sold to new owners/partners and changed the menu to include middle eastern dishes like schwarma and falafel.  It wouldn't have bothered me so much, but the quality has declined dramatically and the prices have gone up.. Gone is my delicious spaghetti bolognese for $7.99, replaced with weird spices and overcooked chicken for $13.99. What is supposed to be hummus is some type of drywall putty. I mourn my old Cafe Volare as they now call it Mia Bella. I am so sad. I will never set foot in this place again and predict that it will shut down within 6 months. It breaks my heart. The new owners should give a course on \"how to take a fabulous business and run it into the ground\"."}
{"text":"ok place for breakfast and they deliver so that's a plus! But other than that, tried their pesto pasta - too oily. tried their burger (delivery), took too long and my burger and rosemary potatoes were burnt - and i'm saying burnt like it looked like charcoal! I did call and let the manager know - so hopefully they don't serve / deliver burnt food anymore."}
{"text":"Glad to find a good lunch option so close to my work, since we get sick of the same fast food all the time.  For under $10, I got the Classic Panini with Rosemary Roasted Potatoes to go.  The sandwich was fantastic with quality ingredients, and the potatoes were roasted dark and crispy, which is how I like em.  The portions were large and it was a very satisfying lunch.  I'm not usually a fan of Italian food, so I look forward to trying the falafel or shawarma specials on my next visit.  (My kingdom for some mujaddara or fuul in this neighborhood!!)  I like that it's a small business, but I think some family drama was going on backstage and it made me feel a little stressed.  I also hope they offer fountain sodas someday, since 20oz bottles are not my fave.  As i was leaving, a 20-seat work lunch arrived, so I'm glad I beat the rush!  Looking forward to ordering here often.  :-)"}
{"text":"If your looking for a place to get authentic Italian food, look no further. Great Italian born owners and staff make this cafe the best place in town for a quick lunch or a long cappuccino break."}
{"text":"A panini served with an Italian accent just tastes better. Cafe Volare occupies the corner of an industrial area near The Orleans, so, it's no Roma, but if you squint your eyes and listen to the Italian banter, you may feel a couple miles closer. For me, the lovability of this spot is just that.

They have free WiFi, so yes, you can set up your lap top and sip a cappuccino while busting out some work. 

I had to do a quick 20-minute lunch, so I went for something simple: grilled turkey panini. With the panini came a choice of a side, and I opted for an Italian potato salad. The result: a simple, but hearty lunch. The panini came with avocado (bonus!), and a delicious dressing, and the bread had a the ideal chewiness factor. I can't say it was the most amazing turkey I have had, but I enjoyed the sandwich. As for the potato salad, on the first bite, I thought it was too simple, but the more I ate, the more I enjoyed the pure potatoeyness of the experience. 

The menu features breakfast, salads and Italian specials as well. If you are in the area, I definitely think it is worth trying for lunch or if you need a spot to grab a snack and get some work done."}
{"text":"This is a cute and casual eatery. Looks like it's a family-owned establishment because of the way the staff interacted among each other. Not a fan of bread, I ordered a bunless chicken sandwich with roasted rosemary potato and the soup of the day. My co-worker got a caprese sandwich. We both thought the food was sub-par. 

I repeated twice that I wanted my sandwich bunless but somehow they failed to follow the instruction. Regardless, I would not get this sandwich ever again as it was as boring and bland as can be. You get 3 pieces of chicken on some wilted lettuce and two wilting pieces of tomato slices. I thought the description said \"arugula,\" not spring mix lettuce! It came with no sauces, no cheese, no additional condiments. Blah.

The soup is also another disaster. I'm fairly certain I can make this exact same soup at home but it'd taste ten times better. Bleh! Gosh this soup is a disappointment to Italian cooking everywhere. 

Pass!"}
{"text":"Love this place for lunch!  Fun Italian atmosphere with great food and service.  If you work around the Valley View/Russell area I would suggest going there for a panini."}
{"text":"I really liked this place.  It's the perfect little lunch cafe.  Plenty of menu options, reasonable prices, great espresso drinks, and super friendly service.
The chicken picatta was cooked very well, and the portion was just right.  It comes with a side, and while there are plenty of options, I kinda wished that pasta could have been one of them.  My boyfriend got a turkey panino, and I was pleasantly surprised to see that it was made with thick cut pieces of turkey breast, and not lunch meat.  He really enjoyed it.  His side was the potato salad.  The server explained that it wasn't the traditional mayo based kind.  It was like boiled, chopped potatoes with a bit of oil, and different herbs for seasoning.  Very tasty.  I can't wait to go back, and try some more stuff."}
{"text":"It took me a very long time to try this place out. And I don't feel that I missed out anything by waiting so long. 

The breakfast is solid. But nothing extraordinary. It is supposed to have an Italian flare to it but putting a sandwich in a panini press doesn't make it Italian. Or the heavy use of oregano.

My breakfast sandwich looked delicious. The cheese was all oozy and melted but it just lacked a little something for me. Flavor, maybe? The bread has a nice bite but everything in between in just didn't home for me. It wasn't bad or nasty, just not so Italian.

The potatoes that came with my breakfast had to grow on me. At first bite, I wasn't too thrilled but I will admit, they grew on me. 

It is good solid place especially for the area it is in. Just don't expect to be wowed."}
{"text":"Wow! We stumbled across this place for lunch one day and have gone back many many times.  The food is excellent!  Today, however, was exceptionally good because the mother of the owner made lasagna for the daily special. It was the best lasagna I have ever had in my entire life!! It is a family owned business as well and the service is fantastic!"}
