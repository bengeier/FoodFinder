{"text":"I went mock-crazy! I spent over 100.00 here because I just have to. I. Have. To. Try. Everything. Well, I couldn't afford to buy everything but I frigging tried. So here's what I purchased--Mock ham, mock chicken, mock fish balls, rice dumplings, mock fish, gluten stuff, Thai flavored gluten stuff, chips, hotdogs..etc. The rest I couldn't remember. Sorry.  And I also made sure I tried all the food before I leave a review. Well I did and all of them were good. Really good and I can't wait to go back and buy more! My only concern is most products were GMO. So if you're into that \"I am not eating GMO products because I don't know what it's gonna do with my body kick...\" I am real sorry to say, but you better go elsewhere. I'm one of yous and man..that just completely went out the window when I got here. Don't say I didn't warn you! The service here is wonderful. The lady was super helpful. Very patient with me and answered all my annoying questions. She accepts all types of payment as well, I paid by debit. it is TTC accessible too, so downtowners, grab a backpack with ice packs and head over here quick!!"}
{"text":"LOVE THEM! I went there for the first time on Friday June 15th and picked up their assorted seitan platter (Curry, S&S,and BBQ) and used the curry one later in a stir-fry. SIMPLY HEAVEN! The price is fair, for what you're paying and the quality of the food is outstanding - I go to King's Cafe in Kensington Market downtown just to order it... now i don't have to travel so far just to enjoy its greatness!! But that doesn't mean I don't like treating myself from time to time. Not everything is vegan and the refrigerated entrees are clearly marked on what contains animals by-products (Milk, cheese, eggs, or honey)  Best of All: They have these large size vegan entrees that you can just re-heat at home or at work - everything from spring rolls, lasagne, mock mutton, duck ... the works if you are newly vegan, or just transitioning or simply love the taste of mock meat but aren't fully veg. and they don't skimp on the portion sizes.  Worst of All: First time there, but I didn't see any frozen deserts. They need to get on that They are closed Wednesdays"}
{"text":"I'm a vegetarian who sucks at cooking...I don't know what to cook for myself, so I basically eat the same kinda thing everyday ...(as long as its good. .. then FINE!)  HOWEVERRR, when you have the same diet everyday , one can get bored... like yeaaa you need texture sometimes in your food...soo...  ....here I come to this place, and I was soo pumped .... I was literally hopping from left to right because of all the variety I saw.. drumsticks?!! WOW... that was all *yay* rainbow and butterflies 'til I looked down at the prices ... and then I was like..... ''O SCREWWW THIS,,,, I aint that HUNGRY !! UGH!!'' *buzzz-kill!*  Anyways so.... I just got one item.. the mock chicken 'nugget' looking things... uhh still pretty expensive   got home, oven baked it ... anddd....it was 'ARITE' , wasnt worth it..  *Someone here pointed out that , THIS is the place that supplies the meats for Joe-Yee Vegetarian Restaurant in Richmondhill.... WHICH I went to, and didn't like because of the 'fatty' texture......... well ......... no wonder...  What I bought... I didn't like because of the 'fatty-jelly-texture parts inside'- ewgh just not pleasant! I was hoping it would taste like the mock chicken (chicken satay kabobs) at 'GRACEFUL VEGETARIAN' restaurant... BUT NOPE  ... 3 stars.. A-OK !..."}
{"text":"I have shopped at King's for years and always liked the place and the goods I bought.  However, recently I bought two boxes of mixed ready made snacks and THEY WERE NOT FRESH.  The staff member told me to steam them before I used them.  I was suprised at the suggestion which was never made before but had no suspicion of the quality at that time.  After I got home and ate them, I discovered they were tough and the next day they had a strange smell. I ended up  throwing them away.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Fake meat is more expensive than real meat, i bought a bag of soy meatballs that really resembled meat (texturewise, but they tasted very MSG-y). There was only 1 person working there, i wouldn't say she was super friendly. The service was a bit slow and i think she indirectly called me \"big\" for being a vegetarian."}
{"text":"I came by to pick up some stuff for a vegetarian hot pot dinner and was pleasantly surprised to find the sheer amount of stuff that they carry here. It is a very spacious store and there's a ton of stuff. The lady running the shop was very nice and helpful, offering me numerous recommendations for things I could try. Little did she know that most of the things that she recommended I had already tried before, but that's alright. I was a bit disappointed that I couldn't find a few veggie balls with filling that I normally like, despite them having such a large selection. Prices were on the higher end, even compared to some of the other vegetarian food stores I've been to."}
{"text":"Here you will find the best vegetarian snacks in town.  They have three take out sized boxes, and a party tray. Certain dishes are also available in frozen packages."}
{"text":"King's Vegetarian Food has everything you can think of if you want to cook up an vegetarian/vegan meals.  The staff was so helpful and knowledgable, explaining to me about their different products they carries and how to prepare them properly.  They also have a good selections of lunchbox prepared food.. all you do is just heat it up in the microwave and you have your lunch/dinner ready!   There are also a lot of vegetarian snacks that you can get. The \"beef\" jerky snacks that makes of mushrooms have the texture and the taste of beef.  BTW, King's Vegetarian Food also provides for a lot of the vegetarian restaurants in GTA including King's Cafe, Zen Restaurant and Joe Yee Vegetarian Restaurant."}
{"text":"My family and I have been patrons of King's Vegetarian Food for ages. We are frequent visitors. The staff is informative and honest. Although most Asian vegetarian snacks and food are heavily processed, and should be eaten with caution, King's Vegetarian Food offers a good variety of both processed and unprocessed options.   One of our go-to item for takeout is the vegetarian platter with seitan and bean curd. Platter includes curry seitan, barbecue seitan, barbecue bean curd (mock barbecue bean pork), sweet and savory bean curd, bean curd roll, and crispy bean curd (mock duck). Prices varies depending on the size of the platter.   Our other go-to items are mock beef jerky made of soy and mock beef jerky made of mushroom. Both are delicious snack options. With that being said, remember to always check the labels. Vegetarian selections are not always healthier. Be cognizant of snacks that are deep fried and/or contains MSG.   King's Vegetarian Food offers a diverse array of vegetarian options and more; with natural health products from Ecoideas, organic herbal teas, himalayan salt lamps, nut milk bags to even coral reefs.   Pro tip: Curious about the coral reef I alluded to in the post? King's Vegetarian Food sells it for the lowest price. It can be added to broth, smoothie or eaten as a side dish or cold dessert. Coral reef has high traces of iron, collagen and calcium. It detoxifies your colon, removing yeast and bacteria!"}
