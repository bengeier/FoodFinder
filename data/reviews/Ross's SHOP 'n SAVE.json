{"text":"I am surprised by the other poor reviews. I have experienced excellent customer service from this store. I'm usually there right after work. High school kids work the registers, and they are ALWAYS polite and chatty.   You do have to watch their \"fresh\" produce. Often I bring it home and it's bad in just a day or two. Otherwise a solid grocery shopping choice."}
{"text":"I can't tell you how much I saved on my grocery order...alot! I always find deals . I was shopping and was looking for a certain soup for my mom I had a sweet young fellow help me find it . He stopped what he was doing and walked me right to it. Also love the fact that I was able to get a bottle of wine. How convenient. So glad to have this store it's just what we needed."}
{"text":"Not only do they sell expired food; the prices are absolutely insane!!And the girls who work at customer service are so rude! They don't ever greet you, they let you stand there for 10 minutes and pretend that they don't see you! And if you say something to them like \"excuse me\" they get all huffy puffy! I will never go back after that last experience I had there!"}
{"text":"I go here quite frequently since it is next to the gym I am apart of, and the prices are awesome. The staff on the other hand isn't. It's mainly the cashiers. Everyone in deli is very kind, but the cashiers are very quiet. Once you've been rung out, they turn around and start to be a chatterbox with other employees. If it weren't so close to the gym I'd take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVICE! Thought this would be a great addition to the area...wish there was a decent grocery store around! Prices always marked wrong and my last and final experience at this location was my debit card would not work properly so the cashier asked customer service for help to which she said it was my fault as she was chowing down on her lunch (a salad) mouth full and all.  Very rude cashiers and customer service people. Do not make you feel like a valued customer, more like you are putting them out.  Also, who teaches these people to bag, awful awful store. HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!!"}
{"text":"I decided to update my review for a few reasons, none of them good, unfortunately. This Shop N Save has been open for two years and has gradually gone down hill. I was happy at first to have another place to grocery shop, but now I am starting to feel regret. Apparently, it's back to Aldi's and Wal-mart for this gal.   The things that I like about the store are still the same....easy access, rarely busy, etc. However, the customer service is lacking. No one is ever friendly and I have yet to have a sales person on the floor ask if I need assistance or if I'm looking for something in particular, etc. In fact, the one time I can say that I've had good customer service is today, by one of the employees who had a booth set up with fruit and pasta salad samples.   However, once again, the coupons! the coupons! If you live in the area, SNS will send you coupons with some pretty decent deals on them. Example: $.99 for a case of water, not bad. The shtick, however, is that you have to purchase $25 worth of groceries to utilize that week's coupons. Still, not a bad deal if you're grocery shopping anyway. I had some useful coupons for this week, including a coupon for a box of ice cream sandwiches for $.99 - which my husband is in love with. They are normally $3.50, so not a bad deal. Well, heck. They're out of them. I search all throughout the freezers, no where to be found. Instead, I grab a box of ice cream bars on a stick - same brand, same regular price.   At the check out counter, I ask the cashier if they will substitute the bars for the ice cream sandwiches. The bagger, who overhears me ask, says he will go ask the manager. He comes back from like 3 registers over to relay the message. I say, \"Can't she just come talk to me herself?\" - to which he goes and gets her. The manager, who looks to be not much older than the teenage bag boy, states that she cannot substitute the item for me. I say, well it's not my fault that you are out of an item you have advertised for this particular week, and I don't think it's an unreasonable request, and so on. She goes on to tell me that they are supposed to be getting a truck in this evening, so if I want, I can purchase the ice cream bars at regular price, and then bring them back later to exchange OR she will give me the difference back, so $2.51. Ummm....no. I tell her that's ridiculous, I'm not coming back later. I mean, why should I be inconvenienced? In the end, she says there is really nothing else she can do. She was apologetic, but not helpful in the least. I have always tried to defend this store, since it is family run and all, but not anymore. With nothing but sub-par reviews, I don't see this store lasting much longer...."}
{"text":"Repeated awfulness on at least a dozen occasions. Right next to my gym so I sometimes run in for a few quick things afterwards. Store is dirty, produce often rotting, meat looks gray and awful, store smells bad, most rude employees in any grocery in town and cashiers frequently chat with fellow cashiers over you (the customer) while checking out. Saw a manager today - untucked, dingy & wrinkled white(ish) shirt with a snarl on his face as he fussed with some boxes. Did not even glance my way as I passed him down the cereal aisle. Sir, your employees have learned from you and not in a positive way. May Shop n Save headquarters see these accurate reviews & take action."}
