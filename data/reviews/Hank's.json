{"text":"Eggs Benedict was cold, syrup was watered down, coffee was old, and our waitress disappeared and I'm still here waiting for the bill."}
{"text":"It is always nice to go back to Hank's. We live in the area and when we think of having brunch we usually go there.

The waitresses and the atmosphere are great. Food is really good too, can't go wrong. For example they serve a lovely salmon dish. I especially like their big elephant tea pots. Suits for bigger groups too. Happy to recommend!"}
{"text":"Such a fun brunch place! While there is often a wait on a Saturday or Sunday mornings the friendly service and great atmosphere make up for it. Personal brunch favorites are the eggs pacific and omelettes of the day! Service tend to be very good and their brunch cocktails are highly recommended.

Hank's is also a great spot for some coffee and baked goods, honorable mention to their chocolate chip cookie."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go to Hank's for the longest time, and I finally made it down one day. I had heard great things about the place and I'm happy to say that everything I had heard was true. The staff were amazingly friendly and the service was quick. I ordered the pulled-pork sammy - it was alright, not great. The place was kind of empty for the lunch hour, but it was nice to be able to sit and enjoy a book without loud conversation. I would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"This is a cute place with a nice vibe. I went here for brunch.Good value but the food was subpar. Skip this place there are way better places in Toronto, One good thing, they have $5 caesars and mimosas.

I ordered the eggs and toast. The home fries were under seasoned and the sausages were cold. My boyfriend ordered the chicken and waffles- it might of well have been called half a waffle with a chicken strip. The dish was so tiny. You can get chicken and waffles at Stockyards for $14 with 4 pieces of chicken. 

I give this place a 2.5 overall,  if I could do a half star."}
{"text":"Brunch time? Here's another standard spot.

Omelettes with hash browns. Eggs benny. Waffles with fruit and syrup. That's the kind of generic fare you'll find at Hank's on a Sunday morning. It's no better or worse than you'll find at most brunch places. 

A few items are less boring -- a pancake baked in a Dutch oven, a poached egg with bacon served atop cheddar fries, French toast made from cinnamon bread -- but it's still typical brunchtime comfort food.

Fortunately, the prices are reasonable, and the service is courteous and efficient.

Hank's isn't a destination restaurant. It's a cheap and cheerful neighbourhood spot to meet your friends for a groggy weekend breakfast. But if you're on the hunt for truly imaginative dishes, outstanding execution, artful presentation, or even the cheapest fried eggs in town, keep looking.

They're also open during the week. I haven't tried their lunch, but they seem to offer the standard salads, sandwiches and burgers you'd expect."}
{"text":"I dropped by place on a  late Sunday afternoon so it was pretty empty and I was able to sit pretty much wherever I wanted. 
Since I only wanted a cappuccino & lemon pastry bar as opposed to a meal I sat by the window in the lounge chairs.  It was really nice to have the natural light coming through - perfect for reading.  The cappuccino was pretty good but I thought the lemon bar was overly sweet which my drink couldn't compensate for.
The waitress was nice even though I accidently stayed past closing time (they close at 5pm on Sundays). 
I will have to come back for either lunch or brunch to really get a feel for this place so only 3 stars for now."}
{"text":"After reading all the 4* and 5* reviews, I was pretty excited about eating at Hanks. Wow, what a disappointment! I ordered the pulled pork with guinness which sounded delicious but it was the worst pulled pork sandwich I've ever had. As I munched into the sandwich, there was an obscene amount of oil that came drizzling out of the other end. YUK! I''ve eaten a lot of pulled pork sandwiches and never have I eaten one this bad. Such a shame as I was excited to have a taste of pulled pork over the border. Great location but it's quite 90's looking inside. Oh and also, the waitress was pretty unhelpful too and wouldn't even let me charge my iphone. More of a reason to give this place a measly 1 star."}
{"text":"After reading the fabulous reviews on Yelp and being in need of a caf√© to work in on Friday afternoon, I visited Hank's for the first time last week. It was everything I wanted it to be and more...and I didn't even have lunch there! Not that the sandwiches and soups didn't look fantastic, but unfortunately I had already had my midday meal. Next time I'm in the area, however, I'll definitely be sure to get lunch there as well!

I instead ordered a delicious loose-leaf white tea (which I totally can't remember the exact name of, probably because I couldn't pronounce it in the first place, but it was incredibly wonderful) and a Red Velvet Cupcake. Oh yes, I came to this place without even knowing they had cupcakes, and then they surprised me by having gorgeous-looking chocolate, vanilla, and red velvet ones just waiting for me in the baked goods case! Obviously, I couldn't resist. Anyway, the tea was lovely, came in a super cute elephant tea pot (see my uploaded photos to check it out for yourself!), and provided me with 3 very generous cups of tea. Good value here, folks. And then the cupcake, mmm. A very solid red velvet cake, with some nice cream cheese icing on top that wasn't too sweet. The only slightly bum note was that the frosting seemed ever so slightly hardened on the edges, but it was still delicious so I'm letting it slide.

In addition to the fabulous eats and drinks, Hank's offers free wifi, friendly employees, a laid-back yet classy atmosphere, and awesome tunes. During my stay I heard gems from a wide variety of artists, including Pearl Jam, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Violent Femmes, David Bowie, Beastie Boys, Johnny Cash, and Death Cab for Cutie.

I'll be seeing you again soon, Hank's, don't you worry..."}
{"text":"My friend and I had brunch at Hank's yesterday. My Avocado BLT was delicious and my friend's omelette was great too. The service was perfect, atmosphere is relaxed and the coffee was tasty. We sat chatting for 3 hours without any hassles from the staff for doing so.  

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place makes great breakfast at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place says it's wheelchair accessible when there is a big step at the entrance and not even a portable ramp. Nope, if I can't even get in with my scooter they get one star. If I could give less, for lying about it being wheelchair accessible, I would!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I dine at Hank's on a regular basis, 1 because we live across the street and 2 it has great food, great servive and we love the Hank's Benny!! Have never had a bad experience - great coffee and comfortable seating!"}
{"text":"Nice place for brunch just across from my condo. I had an omelette, toast and home fries on the first visit a couple of weeks back - It was good.  Me and my friend went back today and we both had the Hank's Burger. They were charred pretty bad so I would avoid the burgers. We probably should have returned them but we didn't want to make a fuss. So stick with the typical brunch fare.  Friendly staff and service."}
{"text":"Visited early on a Sunday morning. Comfortable, spacious dining area. 
As we were arrived early we didn't have to wait for a seat. 
My friend and I both ordered 'Eggs any Style', mine with bacon and eggs over-medium. My friend ordered peameal and eggs over-medium. 
When the food arrived it looked great. My friend definitely had the better plate, her eggs were cooked perfectly, the peameal was tasty, home fries just right. My plate wasn't as good. My eggs were hard and the home fries were overdone, crispy. The toast and bacon did taste good though and the coffee was free flowing and strong. 
Even though my plate wasn't the best I would like to try this place again, the service was very good and they didn't rush us to leave even when there was a line at the door."}
{"text":"For some reason breakfast is my favorite meal, even though I don't really like eggs.

You can eat dessert for an entire meal and call it breakfast/brunch and no one judges you.

I've eaten at Hank's twice, and you must like/love/heart poached eggs to eat here.  Poached egg or hamburgers.  I had the breakfast poutine, which they nicely substituted scrambled since I die a little bit when I eat runny egg.  It was good, but probably better with the runny-ness since I did find it a bit dry.

The second time I had the pancake, pretty good, but really only eat here if you are an egg benny.

I had the same waiter both times, service was good, but my chai latte was luke warm *sad face*."}
{"text":"Absolute favourite new breakfast place. Followed the eggs Benny recommendation and was not disappointed. Great service and lovely, friendly and welcoming atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great brunch, the coffee is really good! The service is excellent. It's also open at 8am for those that are up early."}
{"text":"I really like this place. Love the Americano coffee and the menu items are simple, tasty and taste like homemade/good quality. The atmosphere is casual and service has always been good. Fair pricing. The type of place you could pop into daily."}
{"text":"Major bummer.  

I am judging Hank's mostly on thier coffee and a little on thier service.  The only food I've had there was a chocolate chip cookie which was pretty good.

I've been to Hank's three times.  

The first time I sought it out as a reccomended place for espresso in Toronto.  I was pleased with the result.  I also enjoyed the setting for doing a little writing and conversating.  

The second time I grabbed a cappucino to go. I do hate to drink my coffee out of a paper cup, but time was short and I thought at least it will be a well crafted beverage.  Wrong!  In fact it was undrinkable.  Really really dissapointing considering I was already on a shuttle Hamilton by the time I realized what a disaster this drink was.  

Cut to six months later I decide to give it another shot, thinking maybe they accidentally ran manure through the portafilter instead of espresso.  I figure from the reviews this place gets they must have got their shit together.  So on this third visit I met my wife who had about 45 mins off in the middle of her work day.  We wanted a quality alternative to the big chain coffee shops that litter this area.  

The layout of the cafe had been completely re-arranged.  It is now more open, but has lost some of it's cozy factor.  The service was uber-slow.  We ordered a cappuccino, tea and cookie.  It took ten to fifteen minutes for the drinks to come.  It wasn't busy.  There is no reason that it should have taken this long, resulting in us having to gulp it down in order to get my wife back to work on time.  The two staff on hand look like they wanted to be anywhere else.

The cappuccino was at least drinkable, but far from good.  It tasted as though they weren't pulling the espresso hot enough, or under extracting the shot.  I have to give these guys extra shit, because they have a Synesso espresso machine which has the most fine tuned controls you can get for pulling shots.  If you are going to spend twenty grand on an epresso machine make sure you can make a better cappuccino than I can make at home with a Moka Pot and stale coffee beans.  In addition the milk was poorly frothed.  No latte art and uneven foam.  Super dissapointing and I will never be back.  

My wife enjoyed her tea, and the fact it was served in an elephant shaped tea pot."}
{"text":"I live on the downtown east side near here and thank god I do.  Hanks is the best spot for brunch in my opinion in the area because you can always get a table for larger groups (4-10 even) with a little wait but nothing like other spots.  The food of course is fantastic otherwise I wouldn't even write this review.  All the Egg Benny's are perfect.  The Dutch oven pancake is a dream.  Coffee and waters were always full without as much as even a nod to be given to the server for more.
Oh and the breakfast poutine is killer (a good sharing dish).
Always my first choice for a friends or family brunches where you want to enjoy your time and not be rushed. Very baby friendly too if you need it."}
{"text":"My MacBook is in the shop. The surrounding air felt like a warm vat of mayo and then it rained buckets. My building shut off the water from 9-5. Today would go down as the suckiest day in history if it weren't for Hank's.

Their whitefish sandwich is enough to chase away the blues; Tender lumps of delicately smoked fish with a schmear of herbed creme fraiche on good toothsome bread. I got the half sandwich ($5) which is really more like a four-sevenths, maybe even a five-eighths, sandwich. OK, screw the fractions. It was FILLING.

Whoa! Were those purple carrots and white icicle radishes in my side order of \"Minty Slaw?\" Yes! Root vegetables have never before induced so much glee.

And real iced tea--strong and unsweetened.

Hank's, you rocked my lunch world and totally saved the day. You may be at 9.5 Church Street but you're a 10 in my book."}
{"text":"Was at Hank's today for a meeting. The person I was meeting with chose this place, otherwise I never would have heard of it!

THOUGHTS:
Nice set up, looked very romantic and well decorated. Think silvers, diamonds and straight lines. Had lots of curtains around everywhere so I think you can section things off easily.

FEELINGS:
Had a Latte that was a little strong, but they still managed to put the pretty leaf on the top. Where do those baristas learn that trick?
Another cute feature was the water glasses - they were mason jars! Love it!
Not sure about the prices as my coffee was covered. 

OVERHEARD: 
I didn't overhear much at this location. It was a quiet location with laid back serving staff. Even the birds loved the place and a few of them visited the interior as the big front doors were wide open (and lovely!).

GREAT PLACE FOR:
- first date
- meeting
- tweetup
- coffee
- girl talk"}
{"text":"Not only do they couple great customer service with comfortingly delicious coffee, their little environment is great as well. I sat inside on a beautiful sunny day I enjoyed it that much. My lunch was definitely memorable. 

They are a hidden little gem, easy to miss but once you find them it's hard not to go back."}
{"text":"What a gem! The value for money is simply unbeatable: generous servings, fresh and wholesome ingredients and everything I have tried there so far is really delicious! 

I love coming here for brunch, the place is moderately busy, you never have to wait in line even at noon. The food is really good and everything is served quite fast. They have a great selection of eggs Benny, their Hollandaise is just perfect, I like the velvety smooth texture and delicate flavour. The smoked salmon eggs Benny are my favorite, but honestly any one you get would be good. Their home fries are nice and crisp on the outside and soft on the inside, not soggy and not greasy at all.

Their daily omelette special is always good, the omelette is fluffy and not greasy, loaded with veggies, meat and cheese and comes with a generous serving of salad or home fries.

Lastly - the toast. The bread is freshly baked artisan bread and it's really good, not that cheap wonder bread kind of rubber bread that they typically serve at other brunch places. And they have gluten free toast as well!

The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because they don't serve freshly squeezed juices. Hopefully the management will read this review and give consideration to expanding their menu offering :)"}
{"text":"I've been to Hank's for brunch numerous times, mostly on weekends and always enjoy their food; I'm partial to the benny with smoked salmon and the breakfast poutine. The coffee is pretty good and, more importantly, bottomless. Service is always kind of surly but never rude. The location is great--central and close to transit--and there is never much of a lineup when I go. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"We came here a second time after an average experience because we live close. The result was exactly as we had expected. The food was okay, looked much better then it tasted. The service was also average. 

The food is a bit overpriced for what it is. I would come again because it's close but not expect too much. Would probably give 3.5 stars if it was possible."}
{"text":"I had dinner here last night and will definitely be returning again. Great southern inspired food made with local and seasonal ingredients.

I am ready to add this place on my weekday restaurant rotation."}
{"text":"Our brunch place of choice.  Never had a bad meal here, and never had to wait more than a couple of minutes for a table.  

Fresh ingredients, the omelettes are never greasy, and they have excellent home fries.

The coffee is also great, something lacking in many other brunch places we've been to around town."}
{"text":"I had their \"Smoked salmon eggs benny\" .
Wow, it was very yummy.
At first, the portion of it seemed to me a bit small, but after cleaned it up, I feel more and more filled.
It was just right amount.
My hus had  \"Poutine\" and it was delis too.
It had perfect amount of sauce that wasn't messy and junky looking.
He loved it.

Unfortunately, their coffee needs a bit more effort.
THIN and tasted like at least 2 hour-old.
We'll go back and try second cup of coffee."}
{"text":"This is a great little place that has very good benny variations; the smoked salmon is my favourite.  Try the breakfast poutine."}
{"text":"My favorite place in the city right now. Not nearly enough great reviews on this place. Thr food quality, prices and service are outstanding. Not to mention that breakfast poutine!"}
{"text":"Excellent food...great atmosphere...very clean and neat. Will definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast, had the egg white frittata, the egg is a tiny bit greasy for my taste. The flatbread is a bit hard to cut. But overall good flavors and nice decor."}
{"text":"Had a couple lattes this afternoon.  Good coffee, despite the construction across the street.  Will go back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Listen to Auntie Wendeh when I say that you can't go wrong with Hank's for lunch - but if you want soup, go early. Otherwise, the sandwiches are top-notch, the pastries and sweets divine and the coffees served by some of the best baristas in the city.  

And if you're the type to be impressed by fancy things, try this on for size: as an offshoot of Jamie Kennedy's Wine Bar (it's in the same location - go to the washroom and BAM! - you're in JKWB), everything is prepared fresh and from scratch in the Jamie Kennedy kitchen. All the soups, pastries, breads, some cured meats, salads - everything. And it's all locally sourced, which is a big ass bonus.

I can vouch for the turkey sandwich (you can order a half sammie, which I love) and beet salad - but I've never been there early enough to try a stew! This makes me sad, because soup is the best. And in conclusion, so is Hank's."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how I've lived in the area for so long without ever coming here - possibly because it's so easy to miss - but I will definitely be coming back here again.

I love americano's and for my daily fix I usually go to starbucks simply because they are everywhere and it's convenient. However, I find them to be quite 'watered down' compared to other places. The americano here is fantastic! Very full and super delicious!

The staff at Hank's is friendly and there is a great patio as well as a decent amount of seating on the inside. I would probably rate this place a five star if the food is as good as the coffee - I definitely intend to go back and try!"}
{"text":"I was here for the first time a few weeks ago, i.e. after the renovations.  What a great spot!  I had the brisket and mac'n'cheese side dish.  Both were delicious.  I enjoyed them to the last bite, even though they're both rich and can be the sort of dish that loses its impact after a while.  

Service was friendly.  Both the atmosphere and the menu are comfortable and sophisticated. That's a tough balancing act, especially without getting too pretentious, but they pull it off."}
{"text":"Pretty nice decor in the restaurant. Feels bright and clean and pleasant. The service was good. Despite the line up growing at the door we weren't rushed at our table to pay and leave. Staff was friendly and helpful and knowledgeable about what they offered (ex. is the chai latte made with a real tea bag or with pumped sugar syrup?). Prices were fair as well. Only problem was that the meals fell flat consistently. Hollandaise sauce wasnt very flavourful, salsa on the Hank's Benny was cold, yogurt and granola was served with a compote or jam instead of fresh berries.  With a tweak to some of the ingredients I can see myself giving Hank's a higher rating and recommending it to friends. Unfortunately the food just missed the mark."}
{"text":"Great local breakfast joint, you can't beat a classic two eggs any style with bread hash browns and fruit , all from local ingredients and all for under ten bucks, but the true kicker is the DUTCH OVEN PANCAKES, available only on weekends and well worth the fifteen minute wait, after having them I came back three days in a row for more, they
Must be putting some crack in them , needless to say a neighbourhood favorite"}
{"text":"Good service, good food, reasonable prices - very much an \"if you're in the neighbourhood\" kind of place rather than \"trek across town,\" but it definitely gets the job done."}
{"text":"GENERAL NOTES
A little coffee shop/cafe serving a select number of meat and vegetarian sandwiches. For some reason they offer a 1/2 sandwich. Apparently they get a lot of overweight children on portion control diets here. Lots of different coffee options, though the bottomless filtered is the real winner. 

MENU RECOMMENDATIONS
Filtered coffee - bottomless for $1.55. Actually. Very good. 
Roast beef brisket sandwich - fucking delicious. I'm starving and want one right now. Like a pulled pork but with delicious roast beef, dipped or covered in au jus or something. Maybe more of a gravy. Some slaw stuck in it. Don't bother picking it out, it's adds value. 

LOCATION NOTES
Church, just South of Front. East side. Hard to miss if you're looking for it.

SERVICE NOTES
Very friendly, helpful staff. I always ask servers what they like and invariably I always get \"You know, everything's good. Yeah, that's good.\". But in this case a lovely young lady informed me that someone made a mistake on an order and she had the pleasure of having to eat the aforementioned roast beef brisket and this excited her very much due to its tasty nature. She said it a little differently than that but I got the idea and so do you. Order it. 

HUMOUROUS STORY
I met Kat at Hank's last week and she ordered a 1/2 sandwich. Actually. And then didn't finish it. You'd make a shameful man Kat."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch at Hank's. 

There was a great variety of brunch/lunch items that made choosing difficult. Food was fresh, well prepared, and tasty. Decor and environment as not fancy but very comfortable. Staff were efficient, helpful, and great!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Canada!!! Everything was PERFECT. The decor, the ambience, the service, the fresh fresh food, and the menu. The price isn't bad at all either. I will find and go back to the place every time I go back to Canada. 
The only downside is that it's hard to find and no private parking. However, there's municipal parking pretty close by which is not too expensive ."}
{"text":"So I don't know why I keep going back, only because its close I guess. I even went to Wine bar for NYE. As always, during brunch, the fruit is hard, the omelette was rubbery and had very few small chunks of eggplant and a few leaves of dry spinach in the 'roasted veggie and spinach omelette of the day'. Other times I've been, same thing, the food is always dried out, sometimes the fruit is rotten, and pretty much everything is sub-par. Dinner at Wine bar next door is definitely better, but brunch needs some serious work. It's really too bad because the place is super cute, the portions are big, and its reasonably priced, but it shouldn't be difficult to serve fresh food. Not going back."}
{"text":"Family and I came here on a recent weekend stay in Toronto.  Several of us chose the breakfast poutine and it was delicious...super crispy fries, velvety hollandaise sauce, and adding chopped tomatoes and scallions gave the dish a great freshness and unique flavor.

The decor inside is very mod, and we enjoyed the music being played in the background. Unfortunately, the service was extremely slow...but it seemed they may have been short staffed that morning.  Not going to really hold that against the restaurant, but it did detract from the overall experience.

Still, we had a lovely meal."}
{"text":"2nd time coming here. 1st time with my bridal arty for brunch. My Bridesmaid loved it so much we came back for her baby shower. They can reserve a larger seating area for you at their resto in the other room if you have a bigger party (we were about 15). Atmosphere for a little brunch party was delightful and the staff were great and accommodating to our requests.

I got the Hank's benne and my partner got the chicken and waffles. Enjoyed both but thought mine was better  :) I like to compare the tried and true stuff across brunch spots and there's was yummy! I especially liked how crispy the home fries were! 

Go here to start your St. Lawrence Market adventure. Then head over to the market walk around for the shopping  and work up an appetite for the food at the market afterwards"}
{"text":"Good breakfast place, got the job done. Good service and coffee. We had the French toast and hanks eggs. Both were good and I would give them 3.5 stars. The service was very prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"I only had time for a coffee when I was at Hank's yesterday, but it left me longing for more!!
I should mention that I walked by a Tim's, a Starbucks and a Second Cup on my way to Hank's as I would always prefer something unique than more from the boring big 3.
Great atmosphere, friendly staff and the menu looks terrific. 
That's actually the only reason I'm only giving Hank's Four Stars at this point. Don't feel it's fair to hand out Five until I've had a chance to try the food, but judging from what I read on the menu, I'm pretty sure the next review will be a Five!
I only wish I'd taken a photo of the latte I had as any coffee lover would have rushed out to get one if they'd seen how perfect it looked.
Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place. Love to go to Hank's for Sunday brunch or even on a nice afternoon just for a coffee. Has a chill vibe, food's great, and very reasonably priced. Service has always been awesome. Coffee is great too. I love how in the summer, the front doors/windows open so you can sit on their couches at the front while chatting with a friend over coffee.

My favorite dish? The breakfast poutine! Fries with sausage, chopped tomatoes, poached eggs, and hollandaise sauce. YUM!"}
{"text":"Hank's has been my go-to brunch place for over a year now, and I've been lucky enough to only have one bad experience there (and it really wasn't even that bad compared to some other places).

My order is always the same: Eggs Florentine with a Jasmine tea (served in an adorable elephant tea pot), and I've never been disappointed by the taste. The hollandaise sauce is the best in the city, the spinach is cooked just right, and the eggs are poached to perfection. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it!

The only warning I will give is that if you see a line-up of more than three people, go back another day. They usually only have one or two servers working, and when it's that busy I think it's hard for them to keep up with all the orders."}
{"text":"Another first 'having brunch' - not something that is typical back home as its either a case of having a superb fry up for breakie or a good steak for lunch. 

I am not sure exactly what I ordered as I was too lazy to look through the menu and just said 'ill have the same' after my friend ordered. 

Okay so I only like my eggs done in one of two ways, sunny side up or omelette and generally I am fussy fuker. So meh I did not really find brunch amazing and spent more time talking than eating.

Peppermint tea awesome and service super good, and the place itself is a nice and open."}
{"text":"Wonderful breakfast place. I ordered the eggs benny. Cooked absolutely perfectly. I usually judge a breakfast place by its eggs benny and this place has it figured out. The florentine was liked by someone in the group as well. I'd like to try their recommended cheddar cheese eggs next time. Cool ambiance and nice location. I took a star off coz I wanted a constant flow of coffee and I ended up getting refills with pots that had barely any left. Annoying when that happens 4 times! I am not sure if a reservation is always recommended here. I did make one but didnt really seem necessary....I could be wrong though."}
{"text":"Have you ever thought to yourself were should I eat for breakfast? I thought The answer was hanks. First of all the waiters and waitresses are miracle workers! One of the waitresses was carrying about 10 stacked cups at once which was amazing. If you like nice art than this is the place for you. The staff is nice but what we didn't know what was coming....i would have rather got attacked by king Kong! I came in a party of 3. We ordered two simple egg Bennys and one hanks Benny. We waited roughly about 25 minutes when they came back with 1 egg Benny and 1 hanks Benny . One member of my party had to wait another 14 minutes to get her meal...but when she did get her meal it had meat in it however she is a peskitarian so she ordered it without meat. It got sent back and she got a new one shortly after. The reasoning that they gave us for our long wait was that they lost our ticket which is ridiculous and inexcusable. I will never return again."}
{"text":"Good cappuccino. The lemon ginger cookies are tasty as well. The service is friendly and quick, and the place itself is small but cozy.

Don't know what else there is to say really."}
{"text":"Yes, the address is 9.5 Church. You'll have to watch out for this spot as it's sandwiched between a boutique office space and JKWB. But it sure is a find once you locate the door!
Sort of like waiting until after an infant develops a personality before giving him/her a name, Hank's came out of memories of kitschy kitchens with a pick-up parked on the front drive. He's the kooky uncle of next door's JK and locally-sourced food flair runs in the family!  Expect some ol' school lux and a tad of tacky: mac & cheese, '50's cocktails, and ugly candle holders.

{"text":"Hank's is a yummy, modern coffee shop without any pretentiousness.

Pros: 
- a yummy egg-white fritata accomodating my request for different content (tomato feta) and a side of peameal
- nice acoustic singer-songwriter music playing
- they let us stay all day and have meetings without objection
- bright, welcoming, nice booths and fun water jars as cups

Cons:
- the wifi wasn't working
- the peameal was dry and way over-cooked

Overall a great find and good alternative to the Second Cup, down the road, especially if you want something other than a muffin for breakfast"}
{"text":"I've been to Hank's 4 or 5 times, now. 

During my first visit to Hank's, the shoddy service was made up for by their willingness to substitute fruit for bacon in a dish, the comfortable setting and the fact that this is one of the few brunch places I have ever been to with no line up. The next few times, service has deteriorated further and the food has left me more disappointed.

I am a consistent diner - I have eaten the same thing each time I've been there and each time the quality has decreased and the fruit selection has gotten smaller (and this time, it was all red grapes, mostly UNRIPENED and a few pieces of cantaloupe). 

My steady dining companion's food has been \"pretty good\" to downright \"blah\". 

Seriously, the last straw was this past weekend when:
- my latte had a distinct burnt flavour (I normally get drip coffee here). -1 star
- my grapes were mostly unripened (first couple times, I got strawberries and pineapples and melon and orange) -0.5 stars
- my companion's tuna salad sandwich was downright bland  (-0.5 stars)
- the server was slow to take our order, slow to bring our food and after waiting for FIFTEEN minutes for her to come back to our table after clearing our plates (so we could get our bill), I was finally forced to go up to the front to pay at the counter. And seriously, folks, I was giving her every hint I could that I wanted my bill, I waved at her, I had my purse on my lap AND my large mom wallet on the table. (-1 stars)

I'm now on the hunt for a new brunch/lunch spot in this hood. Any suggestions?"}
{"text":"This is a cute little place great for brunch. Really enjoyed the atmosphere. The menu options were unique. I definitely recommend the breakfast poutine or the eggs benny! One of the better places I've been to. I would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Very solid brunch!  A bit pricier than I would've liked and the bathrooms are a little on the funky side the morning we went, but the service and food were great."}
{"text":"My friend and I came to Hanks for brunch as we had heard good things from reviewers. I ordered the avocado BLT with home fries. I was impressed with the food, my friend I both enjoyed our meals. 

Hanks loses a point for its lack of staff. When we went there was only one waitress for 8 or so tables on a busy Sunday morning. As such it took forever for our food and bill to arrive. This might have been a one time thing but it certainly detracted from our experience. One other minor thing was the coffee. For me, a great brunch restaurant should have good coffee and the coffee at Hanks was weak and watery. Not impressed by that. Again, it could've been a bad pot or something so I would definitely come back to Hanks but I wasn't overly impressed."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch today on a lovely Saturday morning. First off all the service we received was phenomenal. Very attentive and warm waiters. We got the French toast as well as the two style
Eggs and hot chocolate and cappuccino. Everything exceeded our standards. Even something as simple as hot chocolate stood out against the rest of the rat pack. Can't wait to come back an try their dessert and sandwiches that everyone raves about!"}
{"text":"Ouch.  This place is looking a bit sad and lonely since my last time here in the summer.  The croissants now look like they were picked up at loblaws."}
{"text":"ok, i'm back in love with hanks.  food quality has gone up- and the servers are STILL lovely as ever- (this was always the selling point for me)-

They have done a million renovations and still change up the space every time I come in.

Still, there are things that they could improve on for that 5-star review:
-Hanks, waaaay back in the day, had homemade marmalade (and Jam..and crunchy peanut butter) they no longer have this.  This makes me incredibly sad
-The baked goods- there are some really nice brownies and cookies in the case, but  pass on the croissant.  I don't know why you would offer a subpr croissant- I would be just as happy if it wasn't offered at all.
-Charging for sauce sides??  (*I* have never been charged when I ask for extra jam, sauce, etc...but for some reasons my friends consistently get charged for sauce sides and that just confuses me....)
-offer your full breakfast menu on weekdays please!  PLEASE?!!  Or at least offer the basic 2 egg breaky.


All in all, good quality food and top notch staff still make this place a regular for me"}
{"text":"Friendly service and delicious food. I had the Hanks Benny. Stylish but relaxed atmosphere and wasn't terribly busy on a Tuesday around noon."}
{"text":"Love this place!! During my stay in Toronto we went three times. Always delicious and has a good feel. They weren't serving lunch yet once when we got there and made an exception for us. The only things that wasn't that great was the mushroom soup. Other than that the mushroom and goat cheese wrap was unbelievable, deviled egg sandwich very good, sweet chili tofu pita was amazing and the chicken and veggie salad was great too."}
{"text":"While it's not the most  affordable place to frequent I have enjoyed each of my visits here for breakfast, coffee breaks or for the quick cup on the go. If ever I find myself too early for a bus or train at Union my first thought is \"do I have enough time for a trip to Hank's\" followed by \"I wonder if they are still open\" because I have been sorely disappointed to come here to find their hours don't always sync up well with my desires for it or they just seem to have weirdly short hours. 

Most of my visits here have been during the morning and it's usually pretty quiet with a steady stream of regulars who are more than happy to chat with the uber friendly and chilled out staff. I've never come here in the hopes of looking for quick service, and I have to admit that if they have only one person working it does take them a while to go to the back to prepare food, so come prepared to wait if you're looking for food.
I would like to assume they're  fully staffed for busier shifts. They had a renovation done a year or two ago and while it's less charming and more of a restaurant feel now, I still enjoy siting down in the cafe portion with a book or music. I've had some misses with their drinks namely the americano but more often than not I am very pleased with my drinks and food options here. 

It is a great location to come solo or bring along a few friends and my favourite coffee spot in this area, all their food items have been tasty from their baked goods, sandwiches and more breakfast food like omelettes."}
{"text":"Service really sucks at Hank's.  If you're short on time do not come here on your lunch break or you'll literally have to eat, ask for the bill and pay the bill all within a five minute time period.  This is a place to go only when you are not tight on time.  

Prices are reasonable, and the food is quite good.  Service is essentially non-existent!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch, got egg Benedictine and smoked salmon salad, both were very delicious!"}
{"text":"So I went in for late lunch to get eggs. But ended up having their Market place burger. Had smoked cheddar and cornchips which is a unique combo but it was good. There could been more juice to patty but it was cooked well and Still tasted fine.

It wasn't the best burger I had but it was good. If they went from frozen store bough like patty to fresh ground juicy patty this would go from good to great and they would have one more star.

I will be back for breakfast. Service was great. The guy was friendly and on top of things for being alone but there was only one other group of 4 outside of me.


So I would aim for 3.5"}
{"text":"The espresso is really good. Had the spicy leak soup which was delicious.  Potatoes were very crisp. Ancient toast is great. This is a more premium version of the classic breakfast. Very good value for breakfast. 
Highly recommend for breakfast and brunch. Service was good. Fast service. With that said not many people were there."}
{"text":"I like it. We were looking for a breakfast place close by to the Distillery, and aside from Boiler House and another closed place, If you're deciding between here and Fran's, I would come here, no question. 

The decor is modern and clean. They were able to accommodation our table of 8 easily. They also take reservations. 

My Dutch Oven Pancake was something to try. It was more like a crunchy on the outside, but soft on the inside cake. It came with fresh whipped cream (I wished ther was more), berries and maple syrup. Delicious. 

The Mushroom and Goat Cheese wrap was something that could be improved upon. It was thin and had absolutely no flavour of goat cheese. A disappointed AT ended up eating half my pancake to be sated. We also ordered a side of roasted tomato. Um, you can see from the pic that it was SO not worth $3. 

It was very nice with bottomless coffee, and a gimmicky change of pace with mason jars instead of mugs. Our server was decent and friendly, and gave us multiple bills without too much of a fuss. 

Another one of those places that we could sit for hours blabbing, and they were nice enough not to kick us out."}
{"text":"This is our go-to local brunch spot. Good value, nice atmosphere, and rarely a wait. Highly recommend, but don't tell too many people...there better not be a lineup next time I go."}
{"text":"Ok, I've returned twice since my first visit and today's meal was bad. Won't return. 

You know when you scan a menu and look for the item you're least likely to make at home? Ya, you won't find one of those items here. 

I ordered the ham, swiss and apple sandwich. It arrived with no swiss in it...not sure how that got missed but it's fine, they brought my two slices on the side...weird but who cares. The thing that got me was the amount of dijon on the the bun. Jeeeeze louise, it was like eating a tsp of wasabi with each bite. So ridiculous! I just feel like these are pretty basic no-nos. 

I think three times is plenty of opportunity to prove yourself and Hank's just keeps getting worse with each visit..

Bye Hank."}
{"text":"I practically live here. Aside from making one of the best lattes in town (rivals include Bulldog and Dark Horse), the sandwiches are amazing (their smoked whitefish is one of the best I've ever had), their granola is fantastic, the pastries and cookies are great, and I even buy my bread here."}
{"text":"This place is totally cute.  The restaurant slash cafe place looks like a local post modern furniture place.  The barista was also super cute with his quebec accent.  
My boyfriend and I found this place kind of by accident, was suppose to meet at this random other cafe down the street.  We walked by and saw the young professionals inside all drinking their coffee and eating pastries.  I was like... dude, this is like portland.  Let's go!  So I got my chai latte and he got his mocha.  Sat down with this amazing scone.  I don't remember what it was but it was good.  The waiter asked us if we were in for brunch, what? its Sunday!  duh!  No, we already ate, thank you.  We sat there for about 2 hours.  I was working on this paper cut out card for my grandma, and he read a book recommened by Ira Glass.  The waitress thought we were really cute.
We'll definitely come back and try that brunch."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for brunch last weekend and were not disappointed.  It's a great brunch spot for those in the St. Lawrence Market, Corktown area!  Really good food with great coffee!

She had the dutch oven pancakes and I had the cheesy eggs (scrambled eggs with cheddar).  The dutch oven pancakes were fantastic.  It two pancakes merged together and then finished in the oven.  They are served with mango sauce of some sort, maple syrup and whipped cream (all on the side).   Pancakes were fluffy on the inside and slightly crispy on the outside and the accompaniments were a nice add-on.  I ate half of her pancakes so I can credibly write on these pancakes :)

As for my cheesy eggs, it came with home fries, toast and fruit.  Honestly, the eggs were a tad too cheesy for me, but anyone who loves sharper cheddars would probably really enjoy it.  The cheese flavour definitely comes through.  The homefries and toast were both excellent!  The toast, especially!  

The food came quickly and service was warm.  Decor was pleasant and simple.  All-in-all, a really positive experience!"}
{"text":"Found near our downtown hotel in recent trip Service excellent. I had the cinnamon bun French toast and my husband had the eggs Benny. Both were fabulous and coffee very good."}
{"text":"So I was hanging out around Nathan-Philip Square and desperately needed coffee and was not going to give into the thousand Starbucks within 10 feet of me. Sadly, this area of town isn't exactly filled with independents. My trusty iPhone with Yelp lead me straight to this place and I was blown away!

The atmosphere is cute and quaint with hilariously friendly staff. Everything in this place is cheap, tasty and fresh...what more could you ask for? The cookies are amazing and the coffee is some of the best I've had so far in Toronto. Apparently this place serves up a different roast every week so it's bound to keep any coffee lover on their toes!"}
{"text":"Hank's seems to be a go-to spot for me to suggest - likely because of it's location, ample tables, laid back service, and breezy atmosphere, literally due to the open windows on a nice day. 

The coffee is standard, and is the one menu item that I feel I have the most intimate knowledge of, as I've been here on a number of occasions and have never had anything but a decent americano. 

On my last visit, and my first food try, I ordered a Hank's Benny which comes with an tomato salsa and avocado. A regular benny came. I was running late, so I stuck with it. Overall, it was average. The eggs were cooked to a perfect soft poached, which I love! But the hollandaise was bland, and laced in salt. And the potatoes were a mix of ultra-hot, luke warm and cold. Suspect? Yes. 

Every place has it's quirks, and here, it's the free wi-fi. Why won't it work for me? On every visit it has shunned my iPhone and laptop. I don't know what gives, but it's frustrating, or liberating, depending on what your purpose for hanging around is."}
{"text":"these folks care about their espresso. One of the rarer places that the staff asked me how I was enjoying it, and when they realized it wasn't as good as it could have been, they promptly served me up another one. Their coffee is already fantastic, but that extra level of service puts them over the top. Very neat space overall.

And oh, the food is pretty fantastic - rustic stews and hearty sandwiches, delish."}
{"text":"UPDATE!!

Major renovations to Hank's just done over the holidays. I visited for the first time and every regular that came in was surprised and impressed by the expansion and upscaled appearance. I'm not sure what it was like beforehand but the current space is much larger. No longer the \"little\" shop/cafe, they have ambitions to accommodate a larger lunch/dinner crowd. 

It seems they've taken over part of the previous Jamie Kennedy wine bar space, adding several tables and a couple full sized washrooms in the back. The kitchen now appears shared with the wine bar next door as evidenced by the kitchen staff still sporting the wine bar clothing.

Overall, a nice space to grab some good coffee. The breakfast I had, eggs benedict with peameal bacon and mustard potatoes was tasty. If the food and service keep up, this could be a great full-size cafe."}
{"text":"not a bad place to go eat brunch.. prices are decent. food was nothing too special but for the price you pay, can't expect too much..coffee refillable.. no long wait time.  we walked all the way back from the terminal ...f will definitely try the pancakes next time and do the 15 minutes wait.. seems like from the reviews, it is definitely worth the try.. good services too.."}
{"text":"Holy ISH, Batman!!! Hank's is AWESOME!!!

Did business lunch here at 1 p.m.a few weeks ago... YUM!

I had heard of it before on food boards, Yelp, etc. but had yet to try it for myself or even figure out WHERE it is!

It's tucked away down on the Southernmost block of Church Street, on the east side. Cute!

I can't comment on the atmosphere/decor, because they were renovating when I was there. It was bare, lights were off, construction noise, etc...

The food, however, as well as the service, was FANTASTIC!

The fries are wonderful. They use the best ingredients, especially in terms of coffee beans, breads and cheeses, and everything tastes clean and healthy (yes, even my deep-fried frites).

Did I mention the coffee? It's great. REALLY great.

I can't wait to go back for brunch!"}
{"text":"I had a pulled pork sandwich for lunch which was pretty good, but it was the service and ambiance that were standout. So much so that I came back for brunch the next day and was blown away by the food! The breakfast poutine and dutch oven pancake were both amazing, and the coffee was great. 

Come for some great service and atmosphere, and amazing breakfast!"}
{"text":"Delicious and hot food served quick! Calm n chill atmosphere plus they were playing modest mouse =] that made my day"}
{"text":"Solid breakfast spot just off the Esplanade.  Friendly and efficient service, no issues with substitutions and decent Americano to boot.  My omelet was great as well."}
{"text":"I have Hank's bookmarked for a very very long time.   I finally get a chance to try about a week ago. 

I arrived there at around 12:30pm on a workday.  It was not as busy yet.  I picked a lounge table beside a window overlooking Church Street.   I just love this place.  All tables are set spaciously from each others.  Serving staff is friendly.  Food is very fresh and good.  I ordered the Tofu whole grain sandwich and the Hank's soup.  The tofu sandwich was amazingly yummy.  The soup was a vegetable soup with tomatoes and assorted beans.  It was pretty spicy but light and refreshing.  It was an excellent match with my sandwich.  The sandwich meal includes Yukon gold fries or green.  However, the serving staff told me I could have the soup instead by paying an additional $2.  Lovely!

It was a relaxing and enjoyable lunch.  I love the ambiance.  I will certainly come back and try other items on their menu."}
{"text":"I met my friends here for lunch a few weeks back. The sandwiches are phenomenal. They are ever-so-slightly on the pricey side, I suppose, but they are pretty big and taste like awesome. It's a nice space, though it is on the small side. I really want to go back, but I don't work anywhere near the shop, which is a shame."}
{"text":"My first visit. Came here for breakfast @ 9am based on the Yelp reviews. Not disappointed. The coffee was excellent, fresh and hot. The service was attentive, but you want to come here with time to enjoy the food and atmosphere: not a quick dine and dash spot. I had the breakfast sandwich. It was excellent. I will definitely return. Free WiFi, ask for the password."}
{"text":"This place is known for its brunch. Eggs are the specialty. Try out the \"omelette of the day\". They make it well with  cheese. The fries and the multi grain bread toast add to the taste. I wanted a one with egg whites but they were out of it. Would have loved it if they had options to customize the eggs with mushrooms, tomato and vegetables etc. Staff is good and friendly. You go there for q brunch and get it."}
{"text":"Such a lovely little place, I only wish I lived closer. Have stopped by a couple times for coffee and the croissants but have yet to try the more substantial breakfast fare. So far, so good, and anywhere that sells Orangina automatically earns points with me!"}
{"text":"We finally checked out Hank's this past weekend for Sunday Brunch.

Yum - yum.
Great spot -- wonderful food -- wonderful service.

I had the eggs benny and my hub had the eggs \"benny\" with smoked salmon.  We started with a whole wheat + honey scone with homemade jam.  

What to say -- the scone ws perfect - not dry and the homemade jam was great.
I had an iced coffee with no sugar - the hub went for regular joe.

The eggs were perfect and the hollandaise was great -- not overly rich - nice subtle lemon qualtiy.  Home fries and some friut came along with the dish.  Home fries were light and crispy with herbs.   

Best of all, the food came to the table right out of the skillet.  Hot and ready to eat!

Service was quick but the servers don't push you to leave and let you linger over another coffee.

If you have not checked out Hanks --- get down there --- great brunch.
Actually it was the best eggs benny I have had in ages. Thanks Hank -- we'll be back!"}
{"text":"like the space, the lattes were good... that's really all you need in a place like this."}
{"text":"Stay away from this place. The up sides are that the food is good, nice decor, and cozzie seating. I had the Hanks Benny and my wife/daughter had the Eggs Benny.

Unfortunately, on the down side...the server lost our order and other peoples orders. He would also not come around to our table. They took money off the bill but i still would not go back. The excuse was that they were short staffed but how does that translate into my order being lost. My wife had to wait 15 minutes for her dish after my daughter and I received ours.

I also heard the people next to our table complain about being over charged, and not for the first time."}
{"text":"Hooray for Hanks. Since I was extremely disappointed by the crumbling service at Petit De juner,  Hanks offers a better menu at reasonable prices and staff that actually give a shit about you! 

My friends and I arrived on Saturday around noon and we waited for about 5-10 minutes before we were seated. Take that line at PJ!!! 

As soon as we were seated we handed menus and asked if we wanted to drink. Coffee and $5 mimosas please.  Brought to our table quickly. 

My friends ordered the avocado BLT and the eggs benny. The crispy potatoes that come with the breakfast are amazing. They taste like the fries at Costco so it was a nice different touch than other breakfast places. I ordered the chicken and waffles. Passerbys ooohed and ahhhed as they walked by my plate. The chicken was a huge crispy boneless thigh on top of a dense waffle. Sitting between those,  was a creamy,  crispy slaw that served a good contrast to soften the waffle and chicken. I highly recommend the chicken and waffles. 

We were asked how our meal was,  offered refills on water and coffee. Only drawback was that we had to ask for cutlery but they were very apologetic."}
{"text":"Great brunch!  My friend had the omelette of the day, which was cheddar and sausage, and a drip coffee.  I had (sorry I can't remember the exact name) an eggs benny variation with smoked salmon and spinach, and a cappuccino.  The drinks and food was all excellent.  My friend's omelette was served with toast, which is normally so boring, but this was delicious!  

The service was spotty for sure.  For some reason the server did not do a quality check after bringing our food, although she did walk by us several times.  I can only assume it was an oversight - maybe she thought she did it but really didn't.  Also, a previous reviewer indicated that the drip coffee is bottomless, however my friend finished his coffee half-way through his meal, and no offer was made to refill it.  Perhaps the bottomless coffee is discontinued?  (If anyone knows, can you report on this please?)

I also took a date square to go, after reading Kat's comment about it being the best in the city.  It was very tasty, but I'm not sure I'd describe it as the best.  Sorry Kat!

All in all, great food, even if a less than perfect service experience.  I will be going back to check out the dinner menu."}
{"text":"This is a double shot review for hank's the coffee bar/brunch joint and the wine bar because as far as I can tell, they are connected.

We checked out the Wine Bar first, and it was fantastic.  Local fare served up in delicious fashion.  I was a little worried the portions would be a little too small, since they were described as tapas style, but splitting a few dishes, including one of the steak sandwiches, and I was totally content.  We had the a beat salad, chicken liver pate, and the aforementioned sandwich, along with a couple glasses of wine (as suggested on the menu).  Great atmosphere too.  It is tight, but I'd dare say \"cozy.\"

As for Hank's the coffee shop/brunch joint.  The coffee tastes fresh, comes bottomless, and is costed completely reasonably.  Now, for breakfast, I had the cheddar and eggs, with sides of bacon, home fries, and multi-grain bread.  Yum.  Eggs with the cheddar were excellent.  Starts off all egg-like, but finishes with a nice sharp cheddar.  The sides were all good.  No complaints.  I also split part of the dutch-oven pancake.  Yum. Again.  Lots of dough, but it's sweet and not too heavy.  There were 3 sides; a great rhubarb mix, some maple syrup, and whip cream. to top it off.

The only thing I can say is the services was a little off for our visit to the wine bar.  Hank's services was fine, but they forgot to charge us for our coffee, which we dutifully informed them about - the place deserves it."}
{"text":"I don't understand waht the big deal is.  

I would say the service is ok, nothing special.  Food is good, not great and very expensive for portion sizes.

Maybe I need to make a couple more visits to taste more of the menu but I just don't know if I can actually rationalize it."}
{"text":"Went back here recently and a lot has changed! The menu is the same and the food is still great (I had the omlette special again), but they look like they are renovating the space as half the restaurant was sectioned off behind dry wall. Also, there are now 2 flat screen TVs on the wall. Sort of takes away from the casual, neighbourhood vibe... makes it more like a sports bar or something -- weird. Service was pretty disastrous. Our waitress kept forgetting about us. She didn't bring any ketchup to go with my hash browns, and I kept trying to get her attention without success. I ended up just borrowing ketchup from the nice ladies at the next table! Saving grace -- they still serve tea out of these adorable Elephant-shaped tea pots!!"}
{"text":"My favourite breakfast place when I'm around the neighbourhood. Their standard breakfast is very well-made, at comparable prices to lesser-quality chain breakfast restaurants.

Great atmosphere, nice clean layout. Fantastic service. A real treat."}
{"text":"My wife and I chose Hank's for brunch. After stopping at the 'bucks for some morning joe we walked on over. Yelp led us to Hank's, and we are thankful for this. Great vibes and good space. Not loud or busy-perfect for a morning convo. I had the eggs Benny and it was delicious. I am usually not a ham person, but the combination of flavors was superb. The hash browns on the side were crispy and flavorful. Yum. Give this place a shot. 

Nothing necessarily mind blowing about Hank's, but an excellent stop when you're walking through Toronto."}
{"text":"Hank's is the best brunch and lunch spot in Toronto, hands down.

Great food, excellent prices, and genuine service (seriously, get to know the staff here, they're awesome).

In a neighbourhood filled with tourist traps, Hank's is the only place that packs in the locals. That really says it all, doesn't it?"}
{"text":"Good spot for brunch. Eggs are cooked perfectly, the toast is a really nice multigrain, and the potatoes are quite decent. The breakfast sausages were pretty weak - almost like hot dogs. Also, I substituted a fruit salad for meat in my breakfast and got the tiniest little fruit salad which I would have guessed was a garnish if I hadn't ordered it.

Good value for tea and coffee though! Tea comes in a huge teapot and coffee is bottomless. Staff is friendly and accommodating!"}
{"text":"*There is a good variety of dishes on the menu for everyone, and the price is reasonable for the portion and taste of all the dishes. 

* the restaurant is spacious and bright, and I'm glad that all the tables weren't all packed close together. 

*The atmosphere at Hank's was quite for most of the morning, however around lunch this place became quite noisy with the crowd.

*The overall consensus was that the brunch was good, but it was nothing stellar.

-Belgian Waffle (served with Quebec maple syrup, icing sugar & fruit salad) - $9
Friend ordered the waffle and it was just a good old Belgian Waffle that you can find anywhere else in Toronto. Not too sweet, was super crisp on the outside with a nice softness on the inside.

-Omelette of the Day (Served with toasted ancient grain bread & crispy home fries) - $10
The home fries were just chunk of potatoes and no sauce was given, and they were a bit too crispy and dry on the inside for my liking. I can't exactly recall what was in the omelette of the day, but I think there were cheddar cheese and sausages folded inside the omelette. Surprisingly the omelette is pretty good, fluffy and not greasy, and loaded with generous amount of onions and cheese!"}
{"text":"Came here because of yelp. I intend on coming back regularly. I had the Hank's Benny. The tomatoes and onion were a nice touch. The eggs were hard poached to the point where there was a little yolk oozing but it did not flood my plate. Perfectly done.

They also gave me peanut butter for my toast! Who does that nowadays?! Amazing.

The only hiccup was that I asked for sausage but they gave me peameal. Good thing Iike peameal. 

Otherwise, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Just came back from lunch and it was great. I had the Hank's burger & the Grilled Chicken Quesadilla's from the menu. The burger was big and it was delicious, it came with salad on the side with didn't seem too fresh but I'd give it 4 of 5 because of the burger, however the Grilled Chicken Quesadilla's had was just satisfactory at 3 of 5. 80's music was playing in the background from XM radio which added a cool touch to the trendy decor. If I wanted a quiet sit down I'd go again as it seems like a great place to catch up with a friend."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch on a return from Toronto. The food was great, but the place was packed and that made service quite slow. Make it a late lunch if you are going."}
{"text":"my breakfast place.. I eat there sometimes 2ce a day. Sandwiches are great. coffee is awesome. Service is with a smile. And, the granola is killa!"}
{"text":"something is up here
where has Hank gone???
like most of us I have in the past winter loved hanks
been impressed with old coffee bar, loved the expansion and local menu
THEN last week had dinner on Sat eve...told I should book and found out it was just us and another table, told the menu had changed and they now only do same menu as Wine Bar (not great tapas)
I dont like the Wine Bar and want the old Hanks back PLEEEEASE
something is goin on"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the breakfast poutine and light hangover cure punch!  Wasn't crowded at all on Sunday morning."}
{"text":"First impression of this pace \"bland.\" Menu choices, \"nothing impressive, aside for Hanks Poutine.\" Since I don't believe in stuffing my organs with FAT first thing in the morning, I decided to skim the menu again for something more suitable for my morning brunch...

I like to have freshly squeezed juice for breakfast, when I asked, the waitress for it she told me they only serve Tropicana...

So with \"Tropicana\" in mind my friend and I placed our orders.

We went with Omlete of the day (blackened chicken, banana peppers &chedder) which came with toast and home fries and the Cinnamon Bun French Toast with maple syrup and fruit on the side.

Verdict: nothing to brag about!"}
{"text":"I have given up on Hanks and I probably won't ever go back here unless someone else picks it.

My last 3 visits:
- Friday, May 28 ~915pm - closed (says they are open till 11)
- Wednesday April 21 ~1000pm - closed (says they are open till 11)
- Thursday April 27 ~ 100pm - wow they are actually open, but served me the worst espresso I have ever had the misfortune of purchasing - AND - it took over 20 mins to get 2 small Americanos when I was the only one in the store.  It was seriously undrinkable.  I almost think he pulled it from a used shot.

note: I HAVE had decent coffee here in the daytime in the past, but not in the past 6 months. 

 The good:
- Great ambiance.  Really like all the wood and the artwork.
- The house made marshmallows are great - I made s'mores with the mint ones during the winter
- The menu looks very appealing

The bad:
- They are never open the full duration of their advertised hours
- On April 21 when we tried to go, they had closed up and locked the doors, but 3 of the staff were sitting at a table in plain view of the door winding down their evening, which really pissed me off.  They saw us pull on the door and didn't even make an effort to acknowledge our presence or tell us they had closed early.  They stared at us, then went back to talking.

Where should you go instead?
Coffee: Bisognio at 61 Sherbourne 
Sandwiches: hit the market or mystic muffin during the daytime and P.J O'Briens or C'est What in the evening.

Goodbye Hanks.  It  was fun having you in my rotation while it lasted."}
{"text":"Hank's serves up an A-OK brunch!

This has become a new favorite of my in-laws since they've moved to the area, and I have had the opportunity to enjoy it as well (brunch only). 

They have an extensive brunch menu (but no brunch cocktails before 11:00 AM - so brunch late!). The highlights of the menu are really the various renditions of eggs-benny, including a pacific version (smoked salmon), classic, and one with avocado and fresh tomato salsa. 

Being a bit of a sucker for an avocado, I went with the third benny option, and had to upgrade to include some Canadian bacon, which was an additional $2. Fortunately the bacon was cooked to perfection and deliciously worth it. 

The eggs benny itself was nothing too special, my complaints would be that the tomatoes in the salsa were a bit too ripe, and my egg could have been runnier (I'm learning to request a runny egg!). BUT the hollandaise sauce was a dream - it was just right - and the crunchy breakfast potatoes were perfection!

What really sets this place apart though, is the service. Even though it is exceptionally busy, our server had lots of time for us and regularly refilled coffee and water. She now knows the in-laws by name, but I could tell she was making the same effort with every table, which is especially nice for a relaxing brunch! 

Also BONUS - check in offer of a free pastry or cookie with a $10+ order! My chocolate chip cookie was delightful."}
{"text":"Just went here today for a brunch date with my boyfriend. The waitresses were very friendly and polite. They ask how we are doing and if we need anything sufficiently. 

The reason I'm giving 3 star wasn't because their service wasn't great but it was because the food was mediocre. 

If you're looking to go for a brunch place for perfectly poached eggs, this isn't the place. However, I did really like their sauces. Their hollandaise sauce was different than other brunches and they had Mason jars as water cups! The salad was sort of bland. But hey! What do you expect if you want to eat healthy right? 

Their burgers looked amazing - I haven't tried them, but maybe I'll go back and give it another go."}
{"text":"We loved Hank's. We came around noon for brunch & it wasn't crowded at all. Our waiter was great & his name was Hank, so we may have actually been served by The Hank? Lol!

I ordered the breakfast poutine with a mimosa, and hubby got one of the breakfast deals (eggs, meat, toast, homefries, etc). Service was quick and our server checked in on us a couple times throughout the meal. My breakfast poutine was So. Good. It's basically fries with cheese, tomatoes, green onions, a poached egg, and some hollandaise sauce. I ordered it without the green onions but I think in future I will order it WITH green onions but without the tomatoes - I think they overwhelmed the flavour a bit for me. Portions are generous, and I was full way sooner than I thought I'd be.

It's no two-dollar breakfast, but what we paid for a good brunch in Toronto? Ain't no thang.

Overall loved Hank's! Cute atmosphere, delicious food, tasty drinks; we will definitely come again."}
{"text":"Hank's cafe is now also restaurant and it serves classic Southern comfort food. The sides are big enough to be meals on their own. Biscuits and gravy, grits, ribs, pork chops with red eye gravy, fried chicken. Wow!!! It's the kind of menu that you want to try a bit of everything and you won't regret it but you will need help to get up afterwards."}
{"text":"Love Hanks eat here more than most places in the city. Sunday brunch is the must have, especially the Dutch Pancake.  Yum, with whip cream and blueberries. Is it Sunday yet!"}
{"text":"Had BRUNCH here over the weekend, it's a decent spot! 

Decor is kind of eclectic - lots of amateur looking paintings on the wall, and tables were arranged somewhat haphazardly.

The food was pretty delicious and quite cheap. I had two eggs, peameal bacon, homefries and toast for $8. Bonus points for being not greasy. 

Staff were friendly but could have been a bit more competent. They had some lovely sounding specials which we were never even told about, I didn't see the chalkboard with specials listed until we were already on our way out the door. Food came out quick enough.

Good place to hit up for brunch after your Saturday shopping at St Lawrence market, but not quite sure if I would want to eat dinner here."}
{"text":"The customer service was non pretentious and on point. Food came out fast and they use Real Sugar!! Very good sign. I had a coffee and orange juice and the breakfast burger.. it was so big, I didn't even finish half of it.. it came with home fries/patatoes.. I was going to get Hanks eggs benedict but maybe if I come here again for brunch, I just might. The food is fresh and good.. I don't really like to review breakfast because I'm a good cook myself and I always say Everybody should know how to cook breakfast! This place makes breakfast with a twist.. whatever that means.. Hanks is good. I recommend."}
{"text":"Really surprised with how amazing the food was! Had the smoked turkey club sandwich,and the bf had the chicken and waffles. One small complaint, the waffles were a tad soggy. However the flavourful (salty, just the way i like it) and crispy fries made up for it. Will def return to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"If you work near Bay/Wellington, want somewhere different for a coffee break or lunch and have a few minutes to walk out to the Esplanade (but not quite that far) you should definitely try Hanks.  I say 4 stars - if the sandwich was a little better I would bump it to a 5 star review.  I would come here all the time if I lived in the area.

The good:
- Bottomless coffee for $1.55, wow (note - it doesn't say bottomless but that is what has been reported in other reviews - thanks Yelpers!).  Coffee tasted good/fine
- Other coffee drinks very reasonably priced
- Service is excellent, friendly and unrushed
- Washrooms are amazing.  Cloth hand towels!
- Free wi-fi

The OK:
- The sandwich - bread was white and underwhelming, but the spread was good.  I expected a bit more for half a sandwich at $5.00

You should know:
- There isn't really much of a place to sit that's not table service.  I was a little unclear whether the three tables at the front were served or not, but, I think they were."}
{"text":"Popped in Sunday morning and wasn't as impressed with the place as I was originally was.
Service was excellent, from our waitress to the runner who brought out our food.
In the group of our 3, two really liked their meal, I thought mine was \"meh, I've had better\".
I ordered the Sliced Turkey Breast on Artizen bread. I was expecting actual sliced turkey...what I got was deli turkey on a great bread. It was very salty and unfortunately it overwhelmed the sandwich. Was I disappointed...yes. Did I eat it....yes. Accompanying fries were downright dreadful. They appeared and tasted to be reheated, but they were not very good.
One dining companion ordered the Eggs Bennie again and loved it. 
Another person ordered the Steak and eggs. He originally mentioned that he thought the steak would be dry from its appearance, however he said it was cooked perfectly and was moist.
So...two people loved their meal, I did not love it."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best date square in the city, usurping Red Rocket's previous title. There were samplers at the counter and I'm sure the barista took note of the fact that I wasn't backing away long after I'd placed and paid for my order.

However, the constant menu/ownership/staff changes don't bode well for Hank's, and it's rarely open when their official hours say it should be. Troubling."}
{"text":"Affordable brunch place. Waitress was a bit grumpy, and I like to think Toronto has far better brunch places. But, I did like the decor and they have home fries, a plus.

I ordered the pineapple juice because I like juice in the morning, but it taste like syrup, which just ruined breakfast."}
{"text":"Hank's Cafe has a bright and spacious interior that was very comfortable. The cafe was quiet for most of the morning, which was great for studying and doing some work. However, around lunch hour, it does get very noisy with the lunch crowd. 

Since I had to save room for lunch, the two of us shared one breakfast and we opted for Cheddar n' Eggs: Scrambled eggs and 2 yr cheddar, bacon, toast and home fries.  In particular, the buttered toast and home fries were very good. As well, coffee is bottomless with the purchase of food. 

I would come back again for lunch or brunch another day."}
{"text":"*** 3.5

A solid place for brunch.  I like the coffees and tea's here, they're always a treat.

Now for the food, it's nothing special, but it's not bad.  My taters are always seasoned well (sometimes I wish they were a little more deep fried) and what you get is very solid for the price.  Tried their cheesy eggs and their avocado BLT, both were good and filling.  However, do be careful if you're coming in really early for the avocado BLT, I felt like the bacon was rushed.  Didn't hit the spot as it usually does.

Service is very good here.  From the servers to the owner, they're always very nice and quick to get you whatever is missing (ketchup, sugar, anything).  Now when you compare Hanks to others, Hanks will most times win.

Brunch tax in for about $15-20... trust me Toronto, you can do worse.  Hank's is SOLID. =)"}
{"text":"Awesome service, great breakfast, good ambiance & music!
We were in Toronto just for the weekend and were looking to get a breakfast in town, we were very satisfied with everything!!"}
{"text":"The key to a proper breakfast place is one where your coffee cup never gets empty. Hank's service stood out - very attentive, friendly, and fast despite a busy morning rush. Had a benny and thought the hollandaise and home fries were excellent. 

A little pricey for the quantity and quality, and I've heard from friends who had far poorer service experiences than me, but this will very likely win me over from the Fran's around the corner when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Great weekend brunch place. Small tucked in resto, with simple deco (nothing fancy) but that's kinda what you need on a Saturday/Sunday - just roll out of bed, dress comfortably but not fancy and chill with people you care about...

Cappuccino was nice... I think the Barrista tried to do some art on my coffee (judging by my uncertainty of his artistic attempt, you can tell how \"great\" it must have been). Ordered a dutch pancake, sweet~literally!! Also had a bite of the eggs benny... Not bad.

Do check it out, you downtown yuppies. On a side note, it's really hard to navigate baby strollers in such a small resto... Not recommended =)"}
