{"text":"I wrote a long review on The Prime, but somehow, it didn't get published, so I'm going to write again, but a much shorter version.  My family all loves this place and we've been going here for many years.  In a nutshell, you get really good, like gourmet Chinese food because they have Filet Mignon in the Hawaiian Beef and all white meat chicken in the Sweet & Sour Chicken.  The egg rolls are good, but not as big as some and the portions and price aren't as good as they were before the light rail put many people out of business, but yet, they survived.  The menu is smaller, prices are a bit higher, and the portions are a bit smaller, but we haven't found any better food in Phoenix.  Jenny the owner usually waits on the tables and her husband cooks in the kitchen.  if we need to hurry, we let her know, otherwise, we go for a relaxing meal with the clean and modern looking place that it is inside.  We had our food to go recently for the first time and that was great, too.  She always makes my 3 yr. old feel special, which is really nice."}
{"text":"Great little place, centrally located just West of Central/Camelback. We've had it takeout a few times, but actually ate it there yesterday, and it was delicious. I had the House chicken, which was just the right amount of spicy. The chicken itself seemed really high quality. Even the rice was notably good. We even got a free little desert in the form of a mini mint chocolate ice cream sandwich.  The woman who runs the place is great. Very friendly and good service. The inside is clean and has a modern feel. Once again, very nice.  My only worry is that every time I frequent this place it is very quiet. A couple of new businesses moved into that strip mall recently, so hopefully things will pick up. Please support this great local business!"}
{"text":"FOOD POISONING!!!!  I have gotten take out 3 times.  First 2 food was good enough but not great.  3rd Time-The worst food poisoning I have ever had.  Will NEVER go back here"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing Chinese food! Great flavor and all fresh ingredients! And if you don't love the amazing proprietor something is wrong. She is a doll."}
{"text":"To start out we had egg rolls. The sauce complimented the rolls real well. Not your typical sweet and sour but spicy. The pan fried pork dumplings are delicious. The Mongolian beef packs a punch. It is spicy but very flavorfull. Also had the house plate. If you like shrimp and scallops, this is the one for you! The service is great too. All in all a definite place to keep coming back to."}
{"text":"Amazing, freshly prepared food; some of the very best Chinese food in Phoenix. Service is very quick and efficient. Thank you."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a master of understatement. From the outside and Upon entering, it doesn't look like much.  As it should be, the truth is in the food  food....best beef and broccoli I've ever had.  We are regulars now.  Simply outstanding"}
{"text":"What else could possibly go wrong?  Came with a group of 8. Wasn't too busy. Server only took drink orders for 7 and scurried off. Came back, took the 8th. Then only took food orders for 7 and scurried off. Came back and took the 8th. What, do you only have 7 lines on the pad?  4 of us got the same thing. Each one looked different, tasted different, and came out at a different time. The last one came out after the other 7 had finished eating. Add to that, the inside of the egg roll was still frozen. How could that happen? Made me nervous to eat the rest of the food.  And the art? I almost laughed.  Sorry, I'll give it another try in a year, but for now, 1 star."}
{"text":"Ok people I'm Chinese and am an expert on Chinese food by birth do not go to the restaurant. Not only will you waste 20 dollars on a dish that should cost 10 but the food is not good. ok the only thing that was good was the peking duck, but besides that everything is OVERPRICED. no lie. Lower the prices about 5 dollars each dish. Walnut shrimp was 17.95 should cost 12.95 at the most. too expensive."}
{"text":"Really good food..  This place is a total hidden gem in Phoenix.. more like the real Chinese food you'd get in places like LA, SF and NYC.. not the typical AZ buffet crap..  Prices a a bit high but the food is delicious. Their hours are a bit strange and they often look closed even when they are open.. weird.  Many times Ive been here I was the only person in the place, which I don't understand, the food is really good.. Esp like the Egg Foo Young  The portions are much smaller but the food quality is much higher.. If your used to eating at Panda Express or China Buffet you won't like this place..   But if you grew up in Seattle, SF, LA or NYC you'll def appreciate The Prime. Its not as good as those places but its the best damn Chinese food Ive had in Arizona and Im wiling to pay for good food.  Im a big fan of The Prime Chinese Restaurant..."}
{"text":"Just tried out this spot for the first time tonight. Living in Phoenix, my standards for Chinese food are not very high in general, but alas...the boyfriend was craving and Prime is just a few minutes from our place.Thought we would give it a go. Have to say, this place was much better than I was expecting!  We walked in to find a surprisingly minimalist, modern decor...nice.  The host greeted us almost immediately, and we opted to go with two egg rolls with the chicken teriyaki and general tso's (I had wanted to try the pumpkin chicken listed on the menu, but apparently its only available in November...sad day). Our food was ready in about 15 minutes, we carried out, and on the short drive home the boyfriend noted that if the food tasted as good as it smelled, then we were in for a real treat.   Needless to say, it did not disappoint. The entrees, especially  the sauces tasted notably homemade...not full of corn syrup and artificial flavors. I liked the authentic flavors and generous portions of chicken (however a minimal amount of veggies). The rice had more flavor than per usual, and was cooked perfectly! The egg rolls were a treat, and overall the food was pretty satisfying. My only complaint is that the food could have used a bit more flavor and a larger serving of vegetables.   In short: it's clean, cute, great service and good food. I would go back.  Entrees start around $8 and go up to $13ish."}
{"text":"The best chinese food I've had in the 3 years I've been living in Phoenix!  My boyfriend and I went on a Saturday evening and it was surprisingly quiet. The dining room is immaculately clean and the lady who took our order and served was so sweet! We started with the crab puffs and egg rolls. Both were perfectly crisp and the veggies inside the egg roll were too. No greasy after taste or soggy veggies here! I had the house special chicken which had a nice bite and bit of heat to it, and my boyfriend had the kung pao chicken and beef combo. I tasted his and almost wished I got that instead! The sauce coupled with the meat and crunchy cashews was super delish! There were a lot of people picking up to go orders while we were eating, which made me wonder if the dining room was empty due to the fact that's it's tucked away in the shopping plaza. All in all the food was excellent, the portions were huge and I got to enjoy the leftovers for lunch. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Prime has the most flavorful, delicious Chinese food in the valley! Think of any Chinese dish, they do it best! What makes the food even better is Jenny the owner and her husband. They are so sweet and are amazing at what they do! Highly recommend, way better than the mainstream Chinese restaurants. :)"}
{"text":"Love this place! I wasn't sure about it the first time, seeing that is in a strip mall, but like the saying goes don't judge a book by it's cover.  I order the CHICKEN W/ GREEN every time and have not been disappointed. EGG ROLLS are wrapped in thin egg roll paper, spicy, & delicious. MANGO CHICKEN & CLAY POT DISHES are also excellent. Independent & yummy."}
{"text":"I love this place, my family has been going here for over 15 years. It's a staple on our list of options when we're looking to dine out.   The place is always very clean, the service is friendly and the food is delicious. The peking duck and the mongolion beef are amazing.   Jenny, the owner, treats her regular customers like they are family."}
{"text":"The prime never disappoints, with a good selection of traditional dishes and welcoming dining room. I recommend it highly!"}
{"text":"This place was a bit of a surprise, as we were on our way to the airport from a business trip and my colleague wanted to stop for dinner before he dropped me off at the airport and he drove back to Tucson. We Yelped to find someplace to stop and picked a Vietnamese Rest. Well we couldn't find the restaurant but stumbled on The Prime Chinese Rest. Situated in an unattractive strip mall the inside is surprisingly art deco and fun to look at all the art work. Food was good, not great, but will do in a pinch. Pot stickers were decent and they prepared a special Pan fried noodle dish to my taste. Overall a pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"This is the best Hot & Sour soup in the valley.   The Prime is my comfort meal when I have a cold as I always feel great after eating there."}
{"text":"I had decent expectations for this place because of the reviews that it has, but I was sorely disappointed. I went there and ordered from the lunch special menu, which is very limited.   My coworker got the sweet and sour chicken, she said that it was good, but the sauce was thick.  I got the crispy house chicken, and the wor wonton soup. First, the wor wonton soup only comes in large, but I was willing to give it a chance. I shouldn't have. The soup lacked salt, and had barely anything in it. Canton Dragon still has the best wor wonton soup I have ever had.   The chicken was far from crispy, as it was completely overwhelmed in sauce and soggy by the time I got it back to work to eat. The fried rice was mushy, and the egg roll was overcooked.   Maybe this was just a bad day, but I won't be returning to the prime, as I've had much better Chinese food, at a much better price."}
{"text":"Would have taken I photos of our meal but we ate too quickly, yum! Definitely recommend the pork lettuce wraps appetizer, enough to split or a full lunch for one. The Thai fried rice with pineapple was a perfect blend of flavor and texture. I've already added it to my short of comfort food that just makes you feel warm. Very reasonable pricing for genuinely homecooked meals. Kind staff. I could see service slowing  during a crowded night as it's a family-run restaurant, so just make sure you're not in a hurry. All the more to visit on a weekday and have the place to yourself!"}
{"text":"This place has the best Chinese food by far in Phoenix. My partner and I frequent it at least one or 2 times a week. We have never been disappointed. My problem is I always have the same thing. The Tofu with the vegetables is so good!!! I want to try other things but when i get there I can't decide what else I want so I order the same thing over and over!!!! LOL"}
{"text":"I had take out. The lady who took my order and helped me out was extremely nice and caring. When I got home I could tell the food was quality the moment I opened it. The smell hit me in the face immediately. Best Chinese food I ever had and the best part is because of the quality you don't feel gross after eating it or picky through it trying to decide if it's really chicken or not. I don't eat Chinese food very often but when I do, I will be returning here."}
{"text":"This is our go to place for take out Chinese food. We have dined in as well. The food is always great and it is never greasy. It is a bit on the pricier side. Almost $50 for two people.   Jenny is sweet and the inside is clean and inviting, although it has a diner feel, I think it's the table and chairs. The hours are hit and miss for us. We eat early, so it would be nice if they opened earlier for dinner during the week for pick up right after work and if they opened earlier on Saturdays for lunch. But we've never had a complaint about the food."}
{"text":"This is not your \"typical\" Chinese restaurant.  The portions are not huge and flavorless, but rather perfectly sized portions of food that is incredibly pleasant to the palate.  The flavors are fresh, and delicious and it's obvious that each dish is prepared individually, not reheated from a huge pot or wok.   The service is very personable, not rushed.  Jenny's memory is amazing - she takes the time to remember your whole order and presents it with the same care. We drive down here from north Phoenix...and it's worth it every time."}
{"text":"Eaten here 50 or more times.  Food is very good, always clean. Hot and sour soup is always great.  Serves canned soda but I don't see that as a drawback unless you expect free refills.  Jenny - the owner is really sweet but gets lost with big tables and it has helped that she always has help now with the table service."}
{"text":"I went to Great Wall and I thought they had good service good food I didn't have to wait long for my food and I felt safe to eat there because I noticed they were clean . I heard about Great Wall through a friend and they also felt the same way about their food and service thank you this all I wanna say."}
{"text":"So came here off of Yelp reviews and it was OK.  The corn soup was bland,  tasted like corn kernels in broth.  The Mongolian beef tasted very good but what a small portion compared to what I usually get.  I travel through the entire West coast and by far smallest portion.  Service was good and fast.  Price was fine.  Not sure if they did enough for me to come back"}
{"text":"I used to go to this restaurant with a friend many years ago.  I always loved their food.  Tonight I was in the neighborhood and decided to give them a try to see if my memories were justified.  They were.  Though it was a quiet night, the food was excellent.  I was treated as an old friend and felt very comfortable.  The ambiance is great.  They have a small dining room with all sizes of tables.  The tabletops are of brushed aluminum and are gorgeous.  There is original art displayed on the walls, all modern.  Some of it is for sale.  Upon entry there is a very nice divider that separates the dining room from view of the door.  I ordered Sing Chow Rice Noodles and they were delicious.  This place is a little hard to find, but don't hesitate to stop in for either lunch or dinner.  You'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Great food and well priced - the owner is very nice and remembers you from visit to visit. Strange decor but I guess it was a formerly a 50s dinner."}
{"text":"Not at all what I expected. Stopped in after work for a quick bite. Was expecting a small Mom and Pop type place with the basics. Discovered a modern, minimilistic restraurant. The menu is pretty diverse.   I went for Hot & Sour soup. A bit peppery for my tasty, but still worth a try. Chased it with stir fried veggies and noodles with veggies. Although, I did not order any meat dishes there were plenty on the menu.  The service was good and the food was good. Everything I asked for."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic! Jenny is the sweetest lady and she was BUSY while we were there, so it was a bit slow, but we weren't in a hurry. She made sure we were taken care of.  Crab wontons actually have crab in them and they're the best I've ever tasted!   Got the chow mein with chicken, shrimp, and scallops -- delicious.   Minus one star as it's probably one of the more expensive Chinese restaurants and the portions are comparable to other, lower-priced alternatives. However, the quality of the food is top notch. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"best chinese I have had since 1994.  Just wish they had more open hours on weekends.  Highly recommend the mongolian beef.  YUMMY"}
{"text":"In a city lacking in quality Chinese food (and no, Pei Wei does not count), The Prime is a welcome addition to my takeout rotation. I have been there twice now - and I am not sure I agree this is a \"bad neighborhood\" as it is Central and Camelback and signs of civilization are all around - and I have not been disappointed. The curry vegetable is flavorful with just enough spice to give it a good kick. I liked the egg drop soup, too, which was on the thicker side and actually was made with egg! This may seem like a small thing, but I really appreciate that the takeout food has been packed in a box on both of my trips. I hate it when I get a plastic bag with containers stacked on top of each other, which inevitably tip over and spill in my car. It's the little things that make a difference. Eat local and go to The Prime!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why the ratings are so high, I'm really disappointed that we came here. The quality of food is poor and shouldn't be priced so high. The food had no flavor at all. We ordered the Thai fried rice (do not order), chicken lettuce wraps and pecan chicken. The fried rice was overly greasy and tasted too much like shrimp and pineapple...that's it.   I left very disappointed and a little hungry. We ended up sending the fried rice back and didn't feel like ordering anything to replace it.   We will not be back."}
{"text":"Delicious. Can't be the pricing on the lunch menu at a sit down restaurant. Great interior decor that doesn't scream Chinese restaurant. So far I've had the House Special Chicken and Sweet and Sour Chicken. Both were great."}
{"text":"Service is slow but only one server therefore not bad for one person and she is really friendly. Food was okay not the best although definitely liked the appetizer. Portion wise it is a lot of food and definitely had to get boxes but overall not bad if you're craving Chinese food. They did give us ice cream for dessert at the end of service which was also great."}
{"text":"The fried shrimp was really good but every thing else was typical of a chinese restaurant. Nothing special..."}
{"text":"This place has very good Chinese food. Also, the lady running the show was very friendly and made great recommendations. In fact, I'd recommend the chicken dish that I had but I'm not entirely sure what it's called. It's a spicy chicken dish. The house low mein was VERY tasty too."}
{"text":"The food was delicious! Though for some reason our food took a while to get to us(about 20-25min, we were the only second party of two there). Aside from the wait food was YUMMY(tasty and hot)! And this totally one of those \"don't judge a book by it's cover\" places, because it's actually pretty nice inside."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in central Phoenix. it's more expensive, but it's totally worth it. High quality ingredients, friendly service, and lots to choose from. We can't go back to average Chinese takeout after discovering this place. You can order some dishes sauteed vs. breaded and fried. Healthier menu items than most local Chinese options."}
{"text":"don't judge this place by the quality of its lunch specials (although i understand why they need to have lunch specials for those on tight time schedules, they are a family owned place and the staff is always on the run taking orders, cooking and running the food back to you!)   This is the perfect place to go for a quiet relaxed dinner where all you want to do is sit back, enjoy a good conversation with friends and savor the delicious dishes.  Quite an interesting menu with high quality food and I love that you can walk in and order the roasted duck without advance notice.  I started coming to this place years ago with a group of community leaders who liked to have dinner meetings there, and have been going back ever since.  Lots of regulars amongst the customers and it's not unusual to see a large family group come in for dinner to celebrate someone's birthday around one of the large round tables.  This restaurant bravely weathered a downturn in their business all through light rail construction, If you haven't been there in awhile it's time to get back there!  You can see it across the street (to the north) from the Camelback and Central Ave light rail stop and there's ample parking in the lot out front."}
{"text":"First trip to Phoenix and this is right on the rail line, easily accessible, and downright GOOD. We ordered the Mongolian beef, pineapple beef, and short ribs with a side of house special fried rice. The ambiance was so passive and calm! They were not busy and it was kind of hard to get refills after a certain point, but overall the food is worth coming here for. Great way to spend my graduation vacation"}
{"text":"Nice place - I had the house special chicken, a few really fatty pieces but overall good food and great service. Modern decor and nice menu lend make this establishment a good staple in the Chinese rotation."}
{"text":"Walked in on a weeknight with a strong craving for seafood cooked Cantonese style. Luckily we've been here before. May be hard to find as the neon light signs above the place are busted. Look for the red lit \"P\" instead. Place is spotless and the one person at the door was very pleasant. It seems our food always takes time to make it to our table but we've never been disappointed. They cook with a hot wok! Dishes were perfectly  seasoned. Try the House Platter. All other times we've visited, the place was near empty with most people ordering take outs. So if you need a place to linger over good food with a loud group of friends or family., go there. Moderately priced."}
{"text":"The House Chicken looks and smells amazing, but it's SUPER salty. It's basically giant chicken nuggets deep fried and smothered in thick, salty soy sauce. No veggies. I feel a little ick. Lady at the front desk is really nice, though!"}
{"text":"NASTY!NASTY!!NASTY!!!  The people were polite, the place was clean, and the food just dreadful.  Here is what goes into lobster sauce - fermented black beans, soy sauce, ground pork, and a little bit of white sauce mixed into the flavorful soy/bean/meat mixture.  No scrambled eggs!  There was enough salt in mine to stop my heart.  My husband's sweet and sour chicken was not a success either.  Overly breaded chicken swimming in a pool of a very odd sauce - don't know what it was, but certainly not s/s!!  Two little mounds of vaguely brown \"fried rice\" was not even a modest attempt.  Others complained about the small egg rolls - what about the fact that there was maybe a teaspoon of filling in each?  All I want is a decent attempt at Cantonese food - go to a cookbook!!!  Needless to say, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Good atmosphere. Don't let the outside fool you, The Prime is quite possibly the best Chinese food in the state."}
{"text":"Very good, you get what you pay for. They don't deliver, but other Chinese in the area you get stringy, soggy, watery and fatty meats.. Drop the dime and go prime.."}
{"text":"Tried their mongolian beef  for the first time . First the egg roll was very greasy.  I requested that they put less salt. They deep fried the beef and it was extremely salty .The meal was very disappointing.   Service was also slow"}
{"text":"Do not be fooled by the exterior of this place! It's worth checking out.  I live in the area and have frequented The Prime Chinese Restaurant many times. The place is great for lunch and dinner. The serving sized are very large. And the meals are delicious. I recommend the vegetable egg foo young. The service here is very good. You will most likely be greeted by an older Asian woman. She owns the place and is so friendly. I work in marketing and SEO so I offered to help them with getting some more exposure but she seemed doubtful that they would be in business come the new year.   Please check this local business out! They treat their customers with the utmost appreciation and respect. It would be sad to see a business that has been there for 21 YEARS go out of business.   Pros:  - great food - large servings - awesome service - decent wait times - quiet atmosphere  Cons - not exactly cheap - needs better decorating touch"}
{"text":"Truly a hidden gem! Over 4th of July weekend my party of 20 was lucky to find this place completely empty. From the outside it looks like a little hole in the wall. However upon entering we found a modern looking and very clean restaurant. We were quickly seated a kids table and adult table. We literally ordered about 15 different dishes and both tables cleaned their plates! Some of the adult entrees we chose were on the spicy side, an aspect we enjoyed. The service was quick and friendly and as a final touch they served the usual fortune cookies with individual servings of a delicious cheese cake!"}
{"text":"Good little mom and pop place with a really cute asian mom. Good take out and lunch place. Food is consistently a little better than average."}
{"text":"Several years agoI volunteered at the gay center which was located in the same strip mall. Even then being so close I rarely walked the few feet to eat here.  A friend, Greg loves this place so I have gone with him.  I find the decor and feel of the place, cold and uninviting. We have always gone in what would be considered off dining hours so there were often no one else in the place but our table. We were always greeted with enthusiasm, but this is because Greg has one of those personalities that screams friendly and he always gets it in return. So our service has always been spot on.  But the food lacked inspiration. I have never had a dish that would pull me back on my own. It was never terrible or inedible, just blah.  But Greg loves this place and so do others I see. I am just not one of them."}
{"text":"My family has been going here since they have opened. The owners are always friendly and welcoming and the food presentation and taste has always been exactly what you would expect from a good Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Stopped into the Prime on a Monday for a birthday dinner. We had the restaurant to ourselves when we walked in at 8:20pm. From the very moment that we were greeted all the way to paying the bill was such a lovely experience. The food was delicious I had egg drop soup and chicken fried rice. My party shared egg roles and crab puffs and those were very tasty.  We were celebrating my birthday and the lady was so kind to wish me a happy birthday. At the end of a wonderful dining experience the woman treated me with a surprise creme brulee with a candle. She went above and beyond and I cant wait to go back to the prime. The food is delicious and the people are so kind. Thank you for a great birthday dinner The Prime."}
{"text":"Out of towner swayed by the reviews to try this place out. It was about 7:00 pm and the place was dead. I was the only patron dining in, but watched 5 takeout orders get picked up. Very unassuming and dimly lit with stainless steel tables. The menu didn't really present much and seemed to be a heavily used takeout menu you'd find stuffed in your door.   I was surprised to see Moo Shu pork on the menu, but chose an egg roll and their Pineapple Beef. Wow. The menu stated it was a spicy dish but I asked for extra spice. The beef was lightly dusted with cornstarch and held the sauce well (it wasn't drowned in sauce, which I prefer). The pineapple was in large chunks and had really excellent sear. It gave you a great flavor without too much sweetness. There were fried slivers of ginger and green onion scattered throughout. The egg roll was short, thick and seemed to have a great spice to it as well. The owner was a very sweet woman.  I told her that I would definitely stop by on my next trip. Great little hole in the wall!"}
{"text":"Nice inside.  My daughter and I thought it felt like a old diner turned asian.  Oldies playing on the radio, nice clean tables and booths.  The food was great, tasted fresh and they had a simple menu.   When I'm back in the area I will stop there again."}
{"text":"Worst. Food. Ever. We got the Mongolian beef and the meat tasted weird and mushy. It gave my boyfriend an upset stomach for the rest of the night. We threw half the meal away because it tasted so bad. We will never be back again. Literally Chen and Wok or Panda Express would be less expensive and better options than this place."}
{"text":"This is the most faaaaaabulous Chinese restaurant in PHOENIX. We received their artisan fresh Chinese glacier water, and were ABSOLUTELY THRILLED with the service. The H20 is luxury first class."}
{"text":"Love this place so much! Great service, delicious food, and cozy dining room. If you haven't been, you should! For sure my favorite Chinese restaurant in phx."}
{"text":"I discovered this place recently for lunch and had beef with vegetables spicy and it was delicious. I went back for dinner the same day and had the Mongolian Beef and it was done the proper way with green scallions only and it was the best I've had in many years."}
{"text":"Came here with my fiancée a few nights ago and we were overjoyed to have finally found a decent Chinese food place with a good range of vegetarian dishes. Finding a decent place that serves any kind of vegetarian ethnic food is harder than you think, especially in this area. I'm honestly glad that this place exists, but at the same time the service and waiting times are a little disappointing. Servers seem to be absent-minded and the waiting times are longer than what you'd expect from a locale of this caliber."}
{"text":"The Prime Chinese is a cute little family run restaurant, that is tucked away between two comic book stores in a strip mall on Camelback.  We found the restaurant on Yelp after stopping at Half-Priced Book.   We thought the food to be well above average, made with the TLC that only a family run business can give.  Jenny and her husband make you feeling welcome when you come in. Everything was tasty and if we lived nearby, this would be our go to place.  We started off with a glass of plum wine for $8.50. Now this wasn't a small 6 oz wine glass, but instead a 12 oz water goblet. Nice! The wine was fresh, not bitter and hit the spot. We followed it with some Pork Dumplings and Egg Drop Soup. Both were excellent and very flavorful. These Dumplings may be small, but they pack a flavor punch you'll enjoy.   For our entrées, we had the lightly bread House Special Chicken for $11.50 and their Pecan Chicken for $13.50.  The house chicken came in a scallion and light teriyaki reduction sauce, while the pecan chicken had a rice vinegar and honey sauce. Both were very good and too much for us to finish (photos).   Our meal ran us a fair $53.21 before gratuities. The food was very good and memorable. We'll be back on our next trip to the central Phoenix area.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My, my, my.  Where do I begin? If you were to go to Shanghai, you just might get a more authentic dinner.  But thankfully this family owned restaurant exists in Phoenix.  From the moment you step in the unassuming facade, located in a not so glorious strip mall.  The smell of Chinese antiquity begins to spark your senses.  From the hot and sour soup, which by the way is the best I have ever tasted, to the stir fried rice, you can taste that antiquity of a well used wok.  No matter the time you go, the atmosphere is cozy and warm.  Round tables for large crowds to the table for two (so cute) you will love your experience I'm sure."}
{"text":"I have been to The Prime many times.  My friends and family have celebrated birthdays and many other occasions at The Prime.  Jenny (the owner) makes it special every time.  Jenny decorated our table, had a cake, and gave lucky chop sticks to my brother in law for his birthday.  Jenny always goes the extra mile for us.  She is extremely hospitable.  Jenny is one of the main reasons we return to The Prime.  The other main reason is because The Prime makes incredible Chinese food.  Every dish is unique from sauces to vegetables to the protein.  The Wor Wonton Soup is amazing.  For you vegetarians, the Braised Bean Curd is excellent.  Select appetizers and main dishes from a comprehensinve menu.  The menu has chicken, duck, pork, beef, and fish.  I have had a few of the fish dishes and they are executed very well.  Everything on the menu is executed well.  Try the red chile sauce at your table.  It is such a good burn.  The Prime serves beer.  Try a Chinese beer or select a wine.  They do have Plum wine.  For a non alcoholic treat order the Thai Ice Tea.  It is sure to fix your sweet tooth craving.  For you health nuts, The Prime serves brown rice.  The decor of The Prime is very modern.  The walls have cool art work.  There are a couple of large collages on the walls that are fun to look at and the raised fish diaramas always catch my eye.  The Prime offers  a gracious host, an incredible menu, and a comfortable setting.  Dinner here is a must."}
{"text":"Still the best mom and pops Chinese restaurant in phoenix. HANDS DOWN THE BEST!  We ordered the Mongolian beef, pecan chicken, sweet and sour chicken, chicken fried chicken with veggies. It was all cooked to perfection! Very friendly and personable staff/owner."}
{"text":"Found the Prime on Yelp.  Decided to give it a try.  From the outside it doesn't look like much.  Inside it has plenty of table and if you're looking for a restaurant that has lots of gold gilt and dragons then the prime is not for you.  It IS though the place for good Chinese cuisine.  Prices are reasonable.  The server (owner's wife) is very soft spoken and pleasant.  I found her quite interesting to talk to.  The walls of the restaurant are decorated with very nice art work of a subtle nature and very nice. Since we've discovered the Prime, we've been back twice and intend to become steady customers.  I forgot to mention that this is a \"mom and pop\" restaurant which means a lot to me.   In addition to excellent Chinese food, the prices are quite reasonable.  If your favorite food is not listed on the menu, fear not, they can make it.  I happen to like a soup with the unchinese sounding name of Westlake.  While not listed on the menu they can make it and it's good."}
{"text":"Best Chinese in Phoenix!   Mongolian beef is a favorite of the wife. The flounder with beans is my favorite (sounds funny, but it is amazing). Lunch specials are great.   Efficient but amazing service. You will not want for water or tea, not even for a minute. Not kidding."}
{"text":"What a shame that we are the sixth largest City in the world and you can't find good Chinese...until now.  I actually found this place on Yelp!  I went in on a Tuesday night and the place was empty except for folks coming in to get Take-Out.  I was worried.  Is there a reason no one was here?  I decided to listen to the good people on Yelp and take a chance.  So Jenny, the lady who does everything on the front side.  Seated me and I ordered Broccoli Chicken with Brown Rice and House Fried Rice. Clearly the food was thoughtfully made, the fried rice, made with shrimp, pork and crab was nuanced with more expansive seasonings, a real treat for an appreciative palate.  The Beef with the Broccoli was generous in size, and very tender and flavorful.  The food was so good, I phoned my brother and ordered a bunch of take out for he and his family. What was best about this place was how clean it is! WOW!  The modern silver and red motif, great art, and excellent service.  My new favorite place!!!!!  Just writing about it makes me want to return....right now!"}
{"text":"The steamed rice was perfectly sticky, the Yishun Chicken was really spicy and the egg roll was crispy. The portion was a good size (not too much, not too little) and the service was good. They had spicy mustard, soy sauce, AND chili sauces. I'll be back, for sure. It's a good little spot tucked away at Camelback and Central."}
{"text":"Food is always good and fast!  I've never actually eaten in we always order to go. It has become my go to place for Chinese"}
{"text":"Please patron this place. It is too consistently good, and it frightens me to see it so consistently empty. If you are looking for extremely good Chinese food with a central location, please give this place a go. I can't stand the thought of this place ceasing to exist."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese food place in Phoenix. Their BBQ Pork Fried Rice, Sweet & Sour Chicken  and General Gao Chicken are all amazing. I   love the fact that their Sweet & Sour chicken is not a weird red dyed color with questionable meat. Instead, it is lightly breaded REAL chicken in a delicious sauce. If you like your food spicy definitely order their General Gao chicken; you will not be disappointed.  It is not cheap like other Chinese food places near us but their food is made with quality ingredients so I never mind paying more.  It is a Mom and Pop place. We always order and pick-up rather than eat-in."}
{"text":"Excellent service, clean and great food.  They have an awesome veggie soup. Romantic shrimp, similar to sweet and sour - delicious.  Flavor galore in the  lemongrass shrimp.  Tasty brown  fried rice. Amazing green beans that are sauteed. Been here a few times and the food is always consistent."}
{"text":"Actually wanted to give it a 3.5...not quite a 3 but not quite a 4 either.  I had the hot and sour soup and the mongolian beef!  The hot and sour soup was one of the best I have ever had!  It had tons of flavor and was actually spicy!  I would go back just for that!  The mongolian beef was just ok, it tasted like it was cooked on a burned wok or something.  The decor inside was cute and the little old lady waiting on me was super nice!  I am always on the lookout for a good chinese restaurant so I am gonna go back and try some of their other stuff!"}
{"text":"Amazing Chinese food, definitely my favorite for take out in central phx. Reasonably priced and the owner is the sweetest little lady in the world, and she makes bomb food! They use high grade poultry and meat so you never ever get that nasty fatty tendon piece of orange chicken that would normally ruin it for me and is very common in my experience at a lot of other Chinese restaurants I've been to. The lettuce wraps, soups(all of them, seriously), Kung pao chicken are all solid! If you're looking for Chinese in central phx, check out the prime!"}
{"text":"I ordered take-out for dinner, and got the spicy fish with basil and the braised bean curd.  The lady who brought out my food was very nice.  I'd give the food a 2.5 star rating, mostly because it was underseasoned -- as other reviewers have commented.  I was most disappointed in the fish; it was a little dry and there was very little sauce or basil, and no spice to it except a few thin pieces of sliced jalapeno.  I liked the bean curd *much* better.  They used a soft tofu that had a beautiful, silky texture, but even that dish was underseasoned.  I found myself adding a few drops of soy sauce to liven it up, something I never do normally.  Finally, I'd have to agree with other reviewers that the prices seemed a little high for the quality and quantity you get."}
{"text":"While nothing fancy, we have been carrying out from the Prime for years.  Always quality, flavorful, well prepared food.  Truly a diamond in the rough.  This is a great place to have in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"Awesome mom & pop run restaurant!! They are very courteous and the food is delicious!! Decent portions for what you pay! The Mongolian beef was not crazy spicy which I love. Crab puffs have white onions in them, which I'm not a fan of. But good overall. Can't wait to try their lunch special!! Don't forget to check out the local comic book shop next door and head to the barcade nextdoor too!!"}
{"text":"Yum yum! Will definitely be back!  Good lunch selection and good prices.  Service very friendly,"}
{"text":"Another fabulous home style Chinese food at The Prime Chinese...... If you like combo fried rice, it is the best ever...."}
{"text":"I want to become a regular here! First time here and I'm not disappointed what so ever! I had the absolute best Thai Style Curry Chicken! I highly recommend it to anyone that is trying this place and likes spicy chicken. The service is one woman and one gentleman, such sweet people! The space is small but the ambiance is very relaxing. I'd also recommend calling ahead to check in on the availability. Happy (delicious) Eating!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Staff was really polite and attentive and the food was DELICIOUS! Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"This place has really good food for dine in or take out. Order the pecan chicken (not on the menu) with shrimp-fried rice. Delish! Great lunch specials here too. I don't think they do any advertising or they'd be packed every night. Neighborhood gem!"}
{"text":"Love this place. If you don't like it, screw you. The food is delicious. Lunch cost me 6 bucks the other day. The chic interior is radically different from the strip mall exterior (as per Phoenix tradition).   Accessible from the Metro via the Central-Camelback station (right across the street)."}
{"text":"My ex took me to this place and wow it is good.  Hidden Gem is the best way to describe this place.  Recommended it to my family and they go there now too.  I look forward to going here the next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I have coworkers who come here all the time so finally went and checked it out. Really good and affordable food. I usually getter teryaki chicken which is not on the menu but they will make it and it's yummy! Service is fast so great for lunch and it's not very busy surprisingly so you won't have to wait. It's self seating as well. Overall good place for a fulfilling quick lunch."}
{"text":"This place still gets 5 stars for the quality of food and the extremely pleasant service.  Unfortunately, the last time I ate here I noticed that their extremely generous portions have been downsized.  No more leftovers to take home, which is too bad because I love their leftovers.  Also, the mongolian beef I ordered last time was overloaded with scallions.  It's like they were trying to take up space so I wouldn't notice they gave me less meat.  And the meat!  The meat was cooked differently than before.  It was more like the beef in the broccoli beef, which is sauteed and not as spicy.  Okay, after consideration they get 4 stars.  I'm sad."}
{"text":"The best Chinese food EVER! Absolutely LOVED it. my husband and I come here all the time. Very clean and quite restaurant. The lady who greets you is extremely friendly. The food tastes awesome. I always get the chicken and beef fried rice dish, and the eggplant chicken dish. YUMMMMM"}
{"text":"Surely you must be kidding.  I came due to a raving recommendation from a long time Phoenix resident. Fortunately, I've come to take Phoenicians culinary suggestions with a LARGE grain of salt. Having grown up outside Boston, and very close to the coast, I've found that locals have a difficult time recognizing good food. Until recently, Phoenix seems to have been accustomed to very bland and boring food. That has obviously changed but there are still many stubborn hold outs.  That said, The Prime was among the absolute WORST chinese food I've ever had, along with Sing High in downtown. That's another story however.  The condiment containers, the table etc are all coated with a layer of grease. Bad start. The place was empty. Another bad sign. The most basic dishes were ordered. Sweet and Sour Pork. Tough, overcooked, inedible.  Egg drop soup. Bland, gross, and just cornstarch, water and egg.   DO NOT waste your time nor your money.   GROSS!"}
{"text":"Food was great.  Service was a-ok...Like another Yelper stated, it is Mom and Pop.  :)"}
{"text":"The Prime is a great Chinese restaurant. I have been going there maybe twice a year for several years. it is a bit of a drive, but the food is great, the service is great and it is affordable.  They will also specially prepare items that are not on the menu. How many places do that."}
{"text":"Omg, the food here taste like it was prepared in a dirty toilet. That's a compliment compared to what I would like to say about the food."}
{"text":"The Prime is a hidden gem for delicious Chinese food. Much of its business is take-out so do not mistake the open tables as a lack of business. Every time we are in PHX, we come for a meal. Don't miss the Yang Chow fried rice which includes many ingredients in the rice. The stir-fried greens, gailan, is cooked perfectly. Don't miss the Mongolian beef which  is tender and flavorful. The roast duck is a special treat as few restaurants or Asian markets produce roast ducks that have such moist meat, crispy skin and a sauce that is not overly salty. Our other favorite dish is the chili fish which has fried fish fillets in a sauce that you want to hoard because it is just amazing. If you are in a hurry, call in a take-out order. But if you dine in and are patient, the reward is a delicious meal. Service is attentive, by the one helpful woman behind the desk who is also the waitress on the floor. The restaurant is clean and  the decor is simple, leaving the food to shine.  Prices are fair and a good value. Prime is authentic Cantonese/ Hong Kong style cuisine that's worth a try."}
{"text":"When you think of Phoenix and lunch what's the first thing you think about? If you answered \"Who could eat in this heat?\" then you're exactly right? After you've gotten past that you then think what? Exactly, Chinese food. Nothing says Arizona like Chinese food. And surprisingly nothing says it better than The Prime Chinese Restaurant. At the recommendation of my friend Wendy I took my wife and two of our children to The Prime. We walked in at 2pm and were seated immediately. I should add that there was only one other couple in the restaurant at the time and it was 2pm and it is 110 outside and it is Phoenix. But I digress. The service was very polite. We ordered two of the lunch specials. I had the House special. They brought a soup to start, because once again nothing says a Phoenix summer like hot soup. It was tasty and I finished off the tiny bowl. Then came my special. The House special was not tasty. I got one bite in and decided to have something else entirely. At this point you'd think \"Oh no this review is going south quick with no hope for the future.\" But then they brought me a safe meal, sweet and sour chicken. It was in my opinion the freshest sweet and sour chicken I've ever had. Seriously I was sitting on a three star review just now and then bumped it to 4 for that last sentence alone. Add to the freshness some pretty tasty, not your run of the mill fried rice and a very kind wait staff. Let me add a word about the wait staff. We brought a 2 yr old and a 4 yr old and they were so nice to them. We asked for a sprite for the kids and they brought two cups with lids to split. When our meals came out they brought extra plates. These people were awesome. What more can I say, how bout... Ka Pow! Pretty decent lunch."}
{"text":"I like to support local businesses and see so much potential in this restaurant. When we walked in, the restaurant had a one group of 7 only. We don't see any host so we decided to prop ourselves at a booth. The décor is nothing like you would think at a Chinese restaurant. It was really modern/Ikea like.  A small Chinese lady greets us and gives us paper menus, which I think was a little weird. It seemed like there were no other employees except her and the cook. Service was slow. We were there for a whole hour and fifteen minutes! However, I really didn't mind all that much. At first, the restaurant was pretty empty so I thought maybe they didn't have many employees because there aren't many customers, but as the time went on, more and more customers walked in. We left there and there were at least twenty customers after us. I don't know how they will be able to service that many people in a timely manner. So I think maybe they just need to hire some help.  Anyway, let's talk about the most important part and why I am giving them 4 stars. The food was fresh and it was really good! We ordered the house special fried rice, sweet and sour chicken and Mongolian beef. My favorite was the Mongolian Beef - you need to order that! It was packed with flavor!   I am not one to brag about Chinese food...I actually am pretty critical on Chinese food so for me to compliment their food, that really means something!  Also, when we were given our check, we got fortune cookies AND a small ice cream cookie!! It was such a treat!  Try it out, have an open mind, and don't expect to be out of there in 30 minutes."}
{"text":"Tried The Prime tonight because I've read so many good things about this restaurant. I gave up on getting good Chinese in the valley several years ago because, well, you just can't find it. However, the Prime is pretty darn good.   I ordered the Beef with Broccoli and it was absolutely amazing. In fact, it is likely the most flavorful I've ever had. The broccoli was cooked to perfection, the flavor was exactly right and the beef was tender and tasty. However, the rice was over-cooked and gooey and I didn't care for the texture at all...but I rarely desire rice so this wasn't a big deal.  The only reason this isn't 5 stars is because I ordered the egg drop soup and it was NOT what others have hyped it to be. It really didn't taste at all like egg drop soup..probably because it is just too busy. 9.5 years later I'm still in search of good egg drop soup in this city and I think I've given up. This looks like some sort of gravy..I'd liken it to the color of hot and sour soup, actually. There are vegetables in it..which I don't want in my egg drop soup.   Other than the egg drop, I will definitely try this place again in 8-12 months when I next crave some Chinese food."}
{"text":"Oh god, I went back here after having moved out of the neighborhood just for take out.   Sorry, unhappy reviewers, this place is just great. Jenny runs a tight ship, and listen, if you think the service is slow, that's because it's cooked to order, not sitting in a steam table somewhere like a $5 Chinese buffet.   Best Wor Won Ton soup in town.   I love this place to bits. You'll see Chinese families eating there, the cops eat there, c'mon, try it!!"}
{"text":"basic chinese food with decent portions and price."}
{"text":"First, the food: it was pretty good. Not spectacular. We had the shrimp with lemongrass, the Mongolian beef, fried rice and orange chicken. All was OK nothing amazing or nothing that you could not find at any nicer Chinese food joint.  The service: however, was flipping horrible. There was literally one person working the dining room in all functions, busboy (girl) hostess and waiter/server everything. The food was slow coming and no one other than my party and all the other parties in the restaurant who were also waiting to be served noticed or cared. I will not be returning to this barely adequate Chinese food place at all, particularly when there are so many better alternatives right down the street."}
{"text":"I've found it!! After more nasty Chinese takeout than I care to recall, I happened upon Jenny and her fabulous little spot. We had the house chicken with pan fried noodles ($5 up charge) and the crab puffs. The house sauce was a garlicky wonder with a peppery kick and the right amount of scallions. The noodles were firm and there was actually crab (albeit the fake stuff but whatever) in the little puffy deep fried pockets of heaven. The price was steep, $23 for the dish with noodles subbed instead of rice and the side.   On another note, there was no one in the place and no other orders being made at 7pm on a Thursday. I hope the community gets behind this little treasure- miss Jenny was so sweet and man, she can cook!"}
{"text":"Excellent!  Wonderful food, very good service.  It's our new favorite restaurant.  Portions are generous and very fresh."}
{"text":"we went at 845 on a friday night with our baby and she still seated us and was totally sweet.  Best Mu SHu I've had in the valley.   I also had the ribs, and those for some reason are hard to find here in Phoenix.  they were pretty good.  I'll go back, but it was a little spendy.  the ambience was just ok, but with a baby and our lateness the food came out fast and was pretty good and she wasn't mad (or at least she pretended not to be) so I'll take it!"}
{"text":"The Prime is one of my favorite places in Phoenix to go for Chinese food. The place has been open for ages. When i first started going there for dinner, they had white floors and red leatherette booths. The place had the atmosphere of a 50s diner on steroids. Things have changed. The fluorescent lighting has been replaced with decorative halogen track lighting and modern brushed stainless accents. The paper place mats have been replaced by red and white linens. The menu has always been interesting... now, even more than ever.   My favorite back then was Mango Chicken. It's still on the menu, but now my choices are more difficult because there are so many other equally tasty things from which to choose. My favorites now include a delightful curry chicken, anything with pan fried noodles, spring rolls, and hot and sour soup.   Prices are very reasonable, and they are great at accommodating large parties on little notice. The service is great, and i have had no trouble at all getting my meal in a timely fashion when stopping in on my way to another commitment."}
{"text":"Oh. My. YUM!  Ive driven past this seedy strip mall a million and one times and never would have suspected a tasty Chinese place resided inside.   Some friends from out of town were visiting, they wanted Chinese and jumped on Yelp. The Prime popped up...none of us had ever been so we figured we would give it a whirl.   they get 5 stars for food. Every single dish was AMAZING and the egg drop soup was THE BEST I have ever had! The crab puffs were tasty, but had onions in them (which I loooove onions) just wasn't a fan of the onion in them. We had 4 dishes on the table and everyone enjoyed everything, there wasn't a scrap left on the plates, even the picky toddlers that were with us got down.   Minus one star for service. There was one waitress and from what i could see, one cook. There were 4 tables of 2, a 3 top and then us 5 adults and 3 toddles. It took a very long time for food to come out and when it did it trickled out slowly.....BUT the food was soooo good we didn't care, everyone was excited for the next dish!   We will FOR SURE be going back again regardless of staffing issues."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised when my brother brought me to eat  lunch here I had the vegetable delight combo  Soooo Good this place should be packed what's wrong with you Phx ??? The service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Look, BEST freaking Chinese food Ever. Ever, ever ever, ya dig? I thought China Chilli was the poo, but this place is the truth. I loved it, my date loved it... she wanted food off of my plate, but as you know... \"Joey doesn't share food\""}
{"text":"I can't believe I have been missing out on this amazing place for so long.   I have never been inside a chinese restaurant with modern decor. I love it. It's also very clean. Most chinese places I've been to don't give off that feel.   The food is great. I've tried to Mongolian beef and sesame chicken. The cream of chicken/corn soup is very good."}
{"text":"This is a great Chinese restaurant - something extremely hard to find in the Phoenix area!!! As someone mentioned before - a hidden gem in a tiny, kind of run down strip mall.   I love the Mongolian beef! I no longer live close by but will go out of my way sometimes on my way home from work to pick up an order to go."}
{"text":"I've really enjoyed the Teriyaki Chicken Combo for lunch. Great service, and excellent food."}
{"text":"By far the best Chinese food in the valley. Located in central PHX, on NW corner of Camelback and Central. Family owned for 20+ years. Open forlunch and then dinner. Closed 2-5.  Can't go wrong here. Most of customers have been coming here 5+ years. Start with Cabbage Wraps with Jenny's special sauce and crab puffs. Next order anything over low mein, she will do it for you. Ask for desired hottnes :)  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I really, really like this place a lot.  This is yet another restaurant where the surroundings and location don't necessarily say \"this place is excellent,\" but sometimes you have to jump in there.  Or, take the advice of a friend, which is how I found this place.  The dining room has always been quite clean, maybe made to feel moreso with the metal tables (they look like polished aluminum or stainless steel, very modern looking), and there is some decent art hanging on the walls.  The restrooms are situated such that you can see into the kitchen area if you head over to them, which to me says that the owner has some pride in the cleanliness there as well.  The food can be slightly salty now and then, but only if you're really looking to taste the salt.  I wonder if this might be due to variations in the ingredients going into the dishes, but either way I never did run into a \"this is too salty\" situation.  I'd love to point out one or two dishes that stood out, but I think they all did.  Several times did we grab shrimp, chicken, beef, curry, and soup dishes to dine in or take out, and it was always great.  Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Food was great--the Sweet and Sour shrimp was only lightly breaded (I dislike the heavy breading of other Chinese restaurants, but The Prime Chinese Restaurant had a perfect balance), and the Shrimp with Lobster sauce delicious.  The Shrimp Fried Rice was good as well.  However, for a dinner that my boyfriend and I assumed would be very filling (Shrimp with Lobster sauce, 2 egg rolls, Shrimp Fried Rice, and Sweet and Sour Shrimp), the portions were EXTREMELY tiny, while our bill came to $43.  On the bright side, the lady working there was very nice, and the decor was lovely.  It was honestly the best Chinese food I've had yet in the Valley, however, for the small portions for over $20/person, I don't think it will take the spot as my go-to Chinese eatery."}
{"text":"The Prime is my neighborhood Chinese choice. With the Camelback Light-rail construction all but finished, the City gave her a left-turn lane into the property for Eastbound traffic and the nearby Stargate (have to see it to believe it) for convenient access to diners from other times and dimensions. When the light-rail station arrives, the asshole landlord of this eyesore of a strip mail will no doubt double her rent again, but in the mean time, Jenny's place resides just blocks from home.  Jenny (and her family) make you feel like you're sitting at her kitchen table, as she shares with you from the bounty of her generosity and love as your host. That being said, please do not expect a five-star dining experience. As Eric noted, the service can be a bit slow, but It's excellent food, prepared with the best ingredients.  Among my favorites are the (1) wor wonton soup (normally an appetizer for two), made red with spoonfuls of hot chili sauce, (2) the chicken noodle soup (which has nursed me to health through many stomach bugs and influenzas over the years), (3) the bbq pork ribs, and (4) the shrimp and vermicelli clay pot dish.  As of the writing of this article, her niece had just joined the staff as server and helper. She's a bit green, so cut her a little slack.  The Prime is easily the cleanest and quietest Chinese restaurant you'll ever dine in. You can enjoy your food and company in peace among the artful collage art of another nearby restaurant owner and laminated \"brushed-steel\" tables. None of the bustling. Chinese-ranting lunatics nor assigned \"plate clanker\" of China Chili, nor the scurrying cockroaches and leaking sewage lines of Diamonds, the wandering hairs (3 in two different consecutive visits) of Super Dragon, the jarred, made-in-Texas sauces of corporate cookie-cutter Pei-Wei, nor the flickering fluorescents and cracked Formica of Gourmet House of Hong Kong. Just good eats.  Don't miss it."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service! I felt like the woman at the counter was only worried about me and what I needed when in actuality she was treating all of her other customers so well. The place was very clean and very nice.  Food was great. I made a special request for Sesame Beef that is not on the menu, it was great. Not as sweet at I like, but seasoned well and tasted great. It seemed slightly high because I am used to paying $8-$10 for an entrée, but I paid $14. Not complaining, just saying and I fully understand because it was a special request and I was not disappointed.  I absolutely recommend!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese I ever had.  Mongolian Beef and the dumplings are always top notch.  Even the rice is awesome.   Service will be slow probably.  Get the food to go if you are fussy about that stuff."}
{"text":"I've been here enough times to have an informed opinion. This place is okay but not great and it is a little expensive considering the portions are not that large.   The first time I went for lunch I had the lemon chicken and thought it was delicious. It tasted like actual pieces of fried chicken with lemon sauce, not like the Mcnuggets a lot of places use.   But I've since gone back twice for dinner and both times, I wasn't that crazy about the food. A month ago, I had some type of szechuan black pepper chicken. I finished it, but it was too salty and there was a slightly off putting burnt flavor.   A few nights ago, I tried the Thai style Chicken curry. It was similar to Thai Curry but didn't have as many fragrant herbs and flavors of the real thing,  and again it was too salty. The $1.50 egg roll was good but small. I'd like this place better if it wasn't just a bit overpriced for a Chinese American restaurant of its status."}
{"text":"The Prime is in a muted little strip mall, just west of Dutch Bros coffee.  Inside, you'd never know it's been here 20+ years; they've implemented a nice, modern facelift to the whole interior.  We grabbed a take out order for the first time last night, and it was hands down the best Chinese food I've had in this area of town.  We shared: House Special Chicken- spicy, peppery, not too much breading, not too over-fried, not too over-sauced.  Win.   Chicken Lo-Mein: really well-done.  Wok-fried but not overdone, veg (broccoli, cabbage, onion, shoots) still had crunch to it, garlicky, sweet, heady sauce.   House Special Fried Rice: bbq pork, shrimp, beef, chicken, egg, soy fried.  So good.  You know how so many times at Chinese restaurants the flavors of each dish tend to blend together, due to over-frying in the same, old oil??  Not this place.  I'm delighted I found this little gem right down the street from my house. I'll be there often, come say hi."}
{"text":"Most of my life I have ordered beef with broccoli from every single chinese restaurant I have eaten in. The last time I was in The Prime I decided to try something new that I could share with my lovely lady.   We decided on the \"Sing Chow Rice Noodles.\" On the menu it's listed as a spicy dish and although it has a little pinch that will warm your soul and not make you sweat.   It's a great dish and totally a two person dish if you already got an appetizer or a soup, which I also recommend!"}
{"text":"Prime was not.  It was not yummy. It was not inexpensive. It did not refill soda drinks. It had no other customers.  The lady who met us at the front was expecting us to get take out. Why? There were plenty of tables and it was clean.   We stayed, we ordered Hot Thai Soup, House chicken, House seafood, lemonade, soda and Thai tea with cream. The rice was a very small portion, the seafood was inedible, because the garlic sauce was like mucus and tasted off, not worth $16 for sure!  The chicken was like it had sat on a buffet for hours and I'm not sure what they made the sauce out of, it wasn't to our liking. The soup tasted of mustard not lemongrass and chili or coconut or what you might expect from a Thai hot soup. Thai Rama, Malee's...others have better soup.  I expected a lot better from the reviews. I understand why it's empty now and I'm surprised it's been here so long. It's only because they handled the order fine, service was fine and the place is clean that they got 2 stars.   I would not try them again for food, unless i got really desperate and too lazy to drive farther than their location which is really close to home. I'll probably try the China Buffett down the street before I return to Prime. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Very good Chinese food. The egg rolls are our favorite in the valley. The rest of the food we've tried was good. But we felt they we're pricey."}
{"text":"What a surprise! Was feeling hungry and wanted to try a new place...I found this little gem listed on Yelp! Tucked away in a strip mall, I opened the door to a clean upscale Chinese Restaurant. The food was yummy for lunch specials. Better than the normal stuff you get at buffett bars."}
{"text":"Absolute favorite Chinese restaurant in the valley. Be mindful that usually there is only one server, an older female, and that service is slow, but it is definitely worth the patience. The portions are moderately-sized, but it's difficult to have leftovers due to its deliciousness."}
{"text":"This is best Chinese food I have ever eaten.  Food it's delicious and service it's fantastic. They are very very friendly. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The best Chinese I've had in phoenix! Fast, fresh, and delicious! Love the Wor Wonton!"}
{"text":"Wanted Chinese food and was next door at the comic book store and thought we would give it a shot. Glad we stopped in. My husband ordered the General Tso which he said was the best he has ever had. I had something with rice noodles and it turned out to be way too spicy for me. The waitress immediately wanted to fix the order and get me something different. I ended up with the lo mein. It tasted amazing. We will for sure be back. Great customer service and great taste in food. A must try if you are in the area. And try the Thai tea too :)"}
{"text":"Not the same place I used to eat at in the 80's and 90's.  We had it delivered tonight and it was barely edible....the colagulated jelly mess that was suppose to be the orange sauce sat on top of the rice and the chicken was flabby.  Very disappointed with the orange chicken. Dumplings and spring rolls were ok- not great. Too many other places for Asian fare.  Don't waste your time or money. By the way - the orange chicken made me feel lousy."}
{"text":"Just went here tonight after avoiding it because it looked like a dump on the outside. When the food came, however, my partner and I couldn't stop ranting and raving, \"I didn't know that Chinese food could taste so good!\"  The hot and sour soup was amazing! The pineapple on the \"romantic shrimp\" was fresh cut and ripe! Do yourself a favor and give Chinese a try for something other than bad, canned takeout."}
{"text":"Prime is pretty hit-or-miss. We've had some of the dishes here multiple times, and what we've learned is this: if it's \"crispy\" on the menu, there's a 50% chance it'll be crispy and a 50% chance it's just going to be chewy. The Thai Style Pineapple Fried Rice and Mango Chicken are both great sometimes, and other times just bad. The Mongolian Beef & Beef with Broccoli seem to be sure bets.  What keeps us coming back? Well, the portions are a good size, and sometimes it's just so damn good. Also, it's never overly greasy, it's so convenient, and the lady who always takes our orders and is there when we pick-up is just so sweet.   As one of the other reviewers said, it's just so hard to find good Chinese in the valley... ultimately, this hits the spot."}
{"text":"Wow, what a hidden gem!    Went on a Tuesday night at it was completely dead.  Don't judge a book by it's cover.  Despite being in a bad neighborhood, the interior is very modern and clean.    We ordered sizzling rice soup, bean curd with mushrooms and bok choy and egg fried rice.  Everything was delicious!  The bean curd dish was very unique.  You could tell it was very fresh, not slathered in MSG and microwaved (like some Chinese restaurants).    This is my new favorite go-to Chinese place!  Go to Prime people!  You won't regret it.    Service was very friendly too."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch and had the bowl of wonton soup ($5), garlic shrimp combo with vegetable egg roll and fried rice($10.50), and a large iced tea in a big carry out cup  ($3). It was a regular lunch portion.  While the whole meal was very good;  $20 plus tip was a little pricey for the portion size."}
{"text":"I hate egg drop soup with a passion, so when I couldn't get enough of it at The Prime, I knew more good fare was coming my way. This place is spotless. They're real clean freaks. My eyes wandered from picture to picture of all the local art for sale.   The lunch specials are affordable, and in portions that are just right for someone who doesn't want a food coma before 3PM. My house special chicken was pretty good, even though I just can't shake this feeling that the sauce tasted like something more suitable for Mongolian beef. They've got beer and wine, Thai iced tea, and your favorite sodas...which come in cans, not in fountain form!  It's tough to find something downtown with this kind of charm. Or...maybe what I mistake for charm is a conspicuous lack of hipsters. Now you know where to hide from them. ;-)"}
{"text":"Place was ok, a little on the expensive side for what you get and the service wasn't the best, I won't be back."}
{"text":"The outside seems a little sketchy, but when you walk in the dim lighting and modern look is a great setting. My f and I decided to give the place a try since we lived down the street and seen the great reviews. The lady that took our order was very sweet and tentative. The food was good we ordered the General Tso's chicken and Pork fried rice. I will definitely be back in for another bite."}
{"text":"She really does an amazing job with all of the dishes offered.   After trying dozens of different Chinese restaurants around the Phoenix valley, this one is my favorite. It's kind of a hidden gem, which probably explains why I didn't find it sooner. The dining area is very clean and modern, the service is swift and friendly, and the food is absolutely wonderful. I always look forward to returning!  Thank you for feeding Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Actually more than reasonable taste and flavor here!! Started with wonton noodle haw fun soup!! Pretty good!! Their roast duck is actually exceptional!! Their dry cooked beef haw fun was really good as well!! Their seafood double fried seafood noodle was really good as well!! Everything genuine tasting!!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Huge portions for a good price of really good Chinese food- which is truly hard to find here in PHX even though there are tons of spots. This place is small- mom/pop shop so they do have limited hours. But the quality of food is amazing. Packing of food is nice and secure and never messy or in cheap boxes like most places. They use legit nice hard plastic with secure lids. Luckily my husband works downtown so he can pick this up and bring it all the way home to Goodyear!"}
{"text":"Wow was this colossally bad. Yelp, I'm shaking my fist in your general direction.  Overpriced, overcooked and underportioned -- either we were there on a particularly bad night or this place has survived on its glory days.  We got this to go; the portions are laughably small. Our dinner party looked at the spread and said, \"So where do we want to get dinner?\" The good news was no liked it very much so the portions weren't a problem. The egg rolls are more like egg roll tapas. Moo shu chicken was flavorless. Lemon chicken was a mess of soggy chaos, wonton chips overdone.  I'll give an extra star because the nice lady offered bottle water while we waited.  For the life of me, I don't get its high rating. Either we were really unlucky or there's some neighborhood loyalty. A symbolic footnote; we offered our dog the leftover rice and she wouldn't touch it. I empathize with the pooch."}
{"text":"This place is an amazing find. The wings are the best I've had anywhere and the entrees are just as incredible. It's a quiet tucked away spot that is well worth a trip. I can't wait to come back and I haven't left yet."}
{"text":"A fantastic experience at this true Mom-and-Pop shop. It's nothing to look at from the outside, but inside you're in for a real treat!  Simple, clean interior. Great menu with lots of variety, and everything we had was prepared and presented beautifully.  Started with Crab Puffs, creamy and rich in a perfectly crisp crust. Hot & Spicy soup was just that, full of seafood and spice without being overwhelming. Seafood Supreme had a nice variety of fish. KT loved the fish filet while I couldn't get enough of their shrimp. Sauce had a distinct flavor while letting all the tastes of the seafood come through.   But the superstar was the Beef with Broccoli, which was simply one of the most delicious dishes I've had. How they get the perfectly trimmed beef so wonderfully tender is beyond me, and the sauce was out of this world. This will be a go-to regardless what else I order on future visits.  Sad not to see more people for dinner. I hope you'll consider this review, from a guy who is rarely impressed by Chinese restaurants, as encouragement to ignore the plain exterior and try this great family gem."}
{"text":"Service was great! Very attentive, kind. The food is very fresh; the vegetables are tender and crisp, the chicken tender, wonderful seafood. The eggroll not greasy. My only criticism, and it's minor, is it needs more seasoning. But now that I know, I'll ask."}
{"text":"I can't believe that I have been coming here for over 15 years, and I've never written a review. Full disclosure, over the years I have become friends with the owner, and husband the chef. I come back for the food though. The friendship is a bonus.   Being from Hong Kong their recipes are authentic and quite flavorful, and they are always open to special requests.   My personal favorites are the double cooked pork, and Tsing chow noodles. The pork is spicy that does not overpower the flavor of the pork and spices. The noodles can be made spicy or mild, either war the curry flavor mixed in is great.   Over all these years, I think I have had an opportunity to eat each menu item at one time or another (unless there are nuts in them as I'm not a fan).    If you are in a hurry, go to panda. But if you want a great meal stop by and have a seat."}
{"text":"I Keep coming back because the food is just great. Hands down the best Chinese restaurant in town."}
{"text":"Food was ok nothing to write home about. Service super slow. 1 person for a 45 plus seat restaurant is crazy! Don't think I would come back! 44$ and still hungry."}
{"text":"I had The Prime bookmarked for the longest time.... I was curious what this little store front had in store. Here's what I found out- The food at the Prime was fine.....the prices and serving sizes were not. The husband tried their pineapple beef and I tried the chicken and eggplant hot pot and a cup of wonton soup. The broth was tasty, the wontons had whole shrimp in them (which I don't like personally, but I'm sure many people do). The pineapple beef was super tasty BUT so small! Like not enough for leftovers at all.... and it cost 14 ish dollars.... insanity. The chicken was just alright, a little on the smoky side and also a fairly small portion. Further, the service was super slow, it seemed there was only one person working both the front of house and the kitchen. So, was the food bad? No. It just wasn't worth the 40$ we spent. I would maybe give them another shot for lunch sometime."}
{"text":"So came here last night w my husband after hearing good reviews. Ever since our favorite Chinese restaurant closed, we have been looking for a new place to frequent. The interior was simple and cute. And I immediately noticed the prices. I'm sorry for Chinese food, I'm not expecting to pay $16.50 -$17.50 on an entree especially for a very small portion! That's just ridiculous!! Well we ordered our go to. We started off w pan fried pork dumplings. Very good. Not too greasy. Then we got the sizzling rice soup w extra sizzling rice. When she brought it out, I thought it was for one person. The soup was much smaller compared to other restaurants that serve this. There were minimal veggies in it which I was a little disappointed to see but overall still very good.   For our main entree, I ordered the shrimp w almond dish and my husband ordered the beef w organic broccoli. Both were very good but I just couldn't get over the price for its portions. At our past favorite Chinese restaurant, for all of this, we would have paid $40 but our bill came to $70! I wasn't expecting to pay this much at a little Chinese restaurant. But I will definitely come back and try their lunch special. N she gave us ice cream as dessert!!! How sweet!  Bottom line: service was good! The owner lady was very attentive. The food here is very good!! Portions are much smaller and a little overpriced. So go during lunchtime! I give it 3.5 ~"}
{"text":"Loved it.  They've been in this spot 20 (twenty) years~! Clean, modern design.  Stainless steel tables, color coordinated chairs, white table cloth & walls and black ceiling.  I used to feel guilty about giving out 5 stars, but not any more. If I really liked it, and I really think my friends should try it = 5 stars.  Food I had was great, place was great, exceeded my expectations = 5 stars. *  Amazing egg roll had lots of fresh veggies and a hint of black pepper. *  Lettuce wraps were just as they should be, fresh with crunchies, crisp lettuce and a tasty sauce. *  Clay Pot Chicken with Asian Eggplant.  Hot (temperature) and perhaps a bit  \"oily\" for my dining companion (not me).  It was a lot more than I expected.  The staff was small and friendly and they had REALLY COLD BEER... yum.  Lived in Phoenix a long time and this was my first time here. Will return soon."}
{"text":"The Prime lived up to its name.  The pevious reviewers have got it right about the great service, cleanliness and fantastic food.  I'm more just weighing in so that my rating is factored into the average.  On my first visit (of what will likely be many to come) a group of us ordered:  Kung Pao Beef and Chicken Mongollion Beef Spicy Chicken Yui Shan Chicken Crab Puffs Egg Rolls  All of them were spot on, the best I've had in the valley and I've been frequenting valley Chinese restaurants for 30 years.  If there's better Chinese food in the greater Phoenix area, please let me know!  Stop reading and get to The Prime posthaste!"}
{"text":"I was impressed with how clean the restaurant  was. Also this was some of the best chinese food I have had for lunch in a long time. Most impressive was the quality of the food. It wasnt like every other low grade carry out place like I was expecting with tough chicken and overly salty sauces. Pleasantly surprised and will return. Service is slow but good and doesnt bother me one bit."}
{"text":"For the past three years, I meet some buddies at The Prime for our Island of Misfit Toys Christmas Eve dinner special. CJ coordinates the group, gives Jenny a basic menu for everyone and she works her magic. The dishes do come out sporadically and with the help of the lazy susan we're able to sample a little (or a lot) of everything. I can't even begin to describe the many terrific meals we've eaten here, but I can assure you we've all left beyond full."}
{"text":"I'm always scared to try a new Chinese place. This place has the best Teriyaki chicken is the bomb!! Amazing service and very clean."}
