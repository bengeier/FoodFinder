{"text":"The place is nice and clean the people are friendly. The chicken was delicious. Only reason for not giving the full 5 stars is because the portion of the chicken is small. I do recommend this place. Order the 3 piece chicken the 2 piece is very small. P. S the beans are watery"}
{"text":"Best tacos and anything on the menu you can have it's great!!! Everything is fresh made!! Hot food coming through!! Fast and order is always correct! Clean and friendly!!! So worth going to and I'm sure your going to become a regular with them!"}
{"text":"Drove by a couple days ago and saw the guy outside digging in his butt while cooking chicken!!! Completely disgusting!!! I mean come on man you're outside....we can see you!!!!!"}
{"text":"It is very hard to miss this place when driving up rainbow and smoke ranch. All of a sudden you'll get the awesome smell of them grilling outside. I ordered a half chicken and it was great. Prices are so cheap this is my new lunch spot."}
{"text":"Was really bad. The meat was dry and did not have seasoning at all. It was like literally just cooking the beef without anything and all you taste is the raw beef taste. The carne asada was sooo bland. She asked me if I wanted everything on it and all it had was CHEESE SAUCE, MEAT, AND A HINT OF BEANS. Disappointing"}
{"text":"The chicken was burned, beans were watery, tortillas were dry and cold. The only good thing was the salsa verde."}
{"text":"This is the best chicken place not only in Vegas but the world everything from chicken to salsa I couldn't ask for a better place makes pollo loco look sorry this location is on lakemead before lamb"}
{"text":"I mean, $1 tacos, taste great, what more could you ask for in a taco truck? Best tacos on the west side."}
{"text":"On my way to the swap meet noticed this white trailer on the side of the road , so stopped to try. It was not sexy looking so didn't have high expectations form the start. Walked up to take a look at the menu (which was all in Spanish)to see what they had to offer.  (what always worries me about these food trucks is that have such large menus and such small space, makes me wonder where there food is REALLY stored at night, ya know!) non the less I was prepared to try it anyways. The tacos were only $1 so we got pastor, cabeza , lengua an asada burrito and 2 drinks. Our total came to $10.00 not to bad! After placing our order I noticed that there were a bunch of half chickens stilling on the grill , kind wish i ordered that instead of the burrito. Ate the tacos first, the meat was tender and it came with onion and cilantro on it, didn't need much more as it was gone in 3 bites as any street taco would be(good thing they are only a $1)  The burrito had pinto beans and rice,very mushy, reminded me of pork and beans out of a can, large in size as it came with a good amt of meat, however dry, so needless to say that it had to be eaten with the red sauce that came with. Over all it was a very clean new looking trailer, the food was what could be expected from a Mexican food truck! If i pass by I will stop again however I wouldn't go out of my way as it wasn't in the best part of town. All in all it was a fun place to discover ..... I was def impressed with the cleanliness!"}
{"text":"So much better than the chain restaurant known as the Crazy Chicken. The food is freshly grilled right outside the front door. I always get the whole chicken and it's a meal for four people. The tacos are authentic and delicious as well. The service is good and the people are nice. Try it. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"This has been one of the best pollo asado I've ever had. I'm from LA and finding a place that has bomb chicken like LA makes me want to come again and again. Forget pollo loco this is the spot! Thanks pollo mobile!!"}
{"text":"This review is for Pollo Mobile 2. At the intersection of Rainbow and Smoke Ranch All I can say is \"well done - bravo!\" The chicken is grilled over chunk mesquite, and These guys know what they're doing. The chicken is tasty and moist, the tortillas excellent, rice and beans,flavorful. An excellent choice if you're looking for a place To swing by and grab some good food for dinner. I like these guys, they work hard So you don't have to. Oh, they grill ribs too, but i've always been too late to get those. I'm calling it in the next time. 4 stars."}
{"text":"Delicious chicken!!  Great fresh salsa bar!  Very reasonable prices and fast service."}
{"text":"Chicken is so moist and good flavor.  Being cooked in front of you, I will definitely come back to try their tacos and other menu"}
{"text":"Delicious tacos and nice people. Recommend the tacos de asada con salsa verde. Small truck sits behind the  convenience store on Smoke Ranch & Jones. You can easily miss it."}
{"text":"The tacos were really good, only thing I wasn't happy about was their debit machine didn't recognize my card. But overall, food was amazing. You can't beat $1 tacos"}
{"text":"Yesterday I bought Carne Asa da Fries. It was so much to eat I didn't think I could finish it. I finished the tray in less than 10 minutes. They were delicious the best Carne Asa da Fries I've tasted."}
{"text":"This place is delecious! Im a huge fan of grilling and this place is always my go to. Authentic mexican taste. And great customer service!"}
{"text":"This is my first time at this location. I must say I really like this location. Very clean and friendly environment.. Not to forget the good is awesome.. I'm so in love with the chicken and tacos. The Wednesday special is awesome"}
{"text":"The best chicken I've ever tasted, they have pretty good costumer service and they make the best salsa in the world. Grab some friends and come give it a try you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Real good food. Great prices. The chicken is delicious and great value when you order the whole chicken. Can't beat it. Best in town!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place. I hear good things about this place but this is probably one of the worse places I ate in my life. I order a carne asada fries and a taco. Taco was super greasy taste bad. Carne asada fries were horrible the meat taste like is been sitting there for days. Fries taste nasty. I would never recommend this place to any of my family or friends."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! I highly recommend their quesadillas...they are huge and taste amazing! Especially with their freshly grilled chicken. Also try their $1 tacos! They are great for the price. Cannot be beat."}
{"text":"tldr \"best asada tacos in town, try the horchata\"  This is a cozy Latin polleria. Don't ask the place to be more than what it is, but it's a really good one in its kind.   The place is clean, so if you need to eat there dont be afraid, the tv's with news and telenovelas in Spanish will keep you entertained.   The best way to go here is to order the asada tacos -the bests you can get around in this town- meat without fat, tasty tortilla, so good you don't even need to add sauce to them.   The agua frescas and the horchata (I liked it even when I don't usually like horchata at all) are super tasty and fresh, not too sweat not too heavy, just perfect to refresh you.   The attention is fast and the lady on the counter is friendly.  So overall, this place is a Latin gem in the neighborhood, you should stop by."}
{"text":"Like everyone says, the grill smoke pulls you in. I got three tacos-- $3!!! The tortillas were fresh and the carnitas were excellent with the red salsa and cilantro. The asada was dry and gristly. Next time I'm getting chicken with rice and beans. There is no truck I don't think at this Arville St. location. This is about the Summerlin location."}
{"text":"A few weeks back, I was driving down Rainbow and notice a huge plume of smoke. I looked over and notice a huge group of people waiting to eat here... NOW I know why... The $1.00 tacos are where it's at! Carne Asada fries are ok, probably wouldn't get them again. The two guys working today were very friendly.  Will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing !!! The chicken is so delicious on top of that their food is always fresh. They have $1 tacos a must try ! They have 3 different type of hot sauces from sweet to spicy but their red sauce is a must try I can personally drink them straight from the little cup. \"TRY THIS PLACE \" you will not regret it."}
{"text":"Yes Five Star,  I was very impressed with the food and price point. I mean, I am not into all that flash and fruo fruo looks. I look at the food. The quality of the meat was on par! They also provided pickled carrots and radishes and good salsa. This place can really compete with other taco trucks and beat'em hands down, I tell you.   This is how good they are, there were these ghetto fabulous Mexicans from Cali with their gold chains and rings talking good ole' Mexican Spanish and ordering 30 tacos de carne asada to go! I mean you gotta love that!   Oh and by the way, its near the Excellent Bar- Herb & Rye, so this makes for a great pit stop before or after you hit the bar.  Til Next Time"}
{"text":"This is probably the most bland chicken tacos I ever ate and the beans I ordered was like water so was the green salsa and the rice was mush and I was charged 2.50 for cheese and sour cream"}
{"text":"Really good , 10+ !! Its fresh and yummy nothing but the best! Something different from restuarants and there nice people."}
{"text":"Simple no frills tacomobile set up in a sketchy parking lot. Come for the awesome authentic street tacos. Carnitas, al pastor, tongue were all top notch!"}
{"text":"Have had this place numerous times and never disappoints. the chicken is phenomenal grilled to perfection . The whole chicken combo comes with rice beans and tortillas . SALSAS upon request.  Also their horchata is a must!!"}
{"text":"The best chicken I ever had I come here every weekend better than pollo campero or pollo loco 100%guaranteed"}
{"text":"Chicken was fresh and juicy!  Have been bk several times! Just wish the sides were bigger"}
{"text":"Great Grilled Chicken! Don't recommend the beans unless you like bean water. Quickly made roasted on mesquite wood."}
{"text":"Just the best. Superb! The smell of the chicken on the grill drives the taste buds wild. The best priced street tacos in Las vegas. With a choice of meats that all taste delicious. Care asada and chicken street tacos my fav this far."}
{"text":"El Pollo Mobile is a small stand on the corner of Smoke Ranch and Rainbow. Very often, you'll see them cooking chicken on an open grill, it's not hard to miss when the scent of freshly grilled chicken and beef is filling your nostrils when passing by. The prices are particularly good considering the quality and quantity of the food that they give you. I've only had the beef tacos so I can't necessarily speak for the other foods that they have but I can guarantee that they have quality food and they are worth checking out if you're a fan of Mexican food as they are a genuine Mexican food business."}
{"text":"What a place to eat lunch, great prices excellent fresh food and the best, a real charbroiled chicken on the grill, I recomend this place that I just found."}
{"text":"Decent food, however...I'm an African American male. There were two separate times where I walked up to the food truck. They went from playing Hispanic music to playing rap. But each time they only played the rap music for about 5 seconds then went back to the Hispanic music. It was as if they were giving an internal signal to tamper with the food based on my race.  I don't trust them."}
{"text":"DO NOT VISIT THIS LOCATION if you expect to have the ordinary el pollo loco experience. The drive thru girl was rude and seemed bothered to do her job (take my order). They didn't have any breast or wings available to order but told me I'd have to pay extra for a skinless breast because they were filling a large catering order. They obviously don't appreciate their customers or they would treat them as such. I respectfully declined and left the drive thru however... i will NEVER revisit that location."}
{"text":"Finally decided to stop and get some food here. DAMN.....Tacos are good. I'm going to try other menu items later."}
{"text":"Amazing tacos!!!! So cheap and so good.  They are so quick with the orders but fresh. Great customer service friendly staff."}
{"text":"The grilled chicken is good! The salsa was a little too watery and the tacos al pastor need pineapple! (Meat was good!) overall is a good spot!"}
{"text":"Really great, especially for the price. The chicken is very tasty and everything was delicious. The wait was about 15 minutes, which isn't bad. The food is served hot, and for $6 you can't beat it. It will definitely satisfy any Mexican food cravings you might have!"}
{"text":"Prices are very affordable. Restaurant looks clean, food looks amazing so far. You can get an 8 piece combo for $13 comes with rice, beans and tortillas. Tacos are $1 each. Saturday and Sundays they have pozole or menudo for $6 bucks. Can't beat that price."}
{"text":"I love this placw. Super authentic and the people are ni e. The chix is the best!!!! Yummy!"}
{"text":"I was coming from the gym and notice smoke coming from this restaurant.i drove over and the smell was intoxicating!the food coming off the grille was great!El Pollos menu has a great selection and great prices.i definitely recommend this restaurant.great stop for lunch."}
{"text":"se los recomiendo un pollito muy sabroso locaciones siempre limpias el mejor pollo que he probado en Vegas"}
{"text":"The food was delicious, inexpensive, and it came out quick. Carne asada tacos were some of the best I've ever had: the meat was cooked perfectly and tasted very fresh. The chicken burrito was huge for $5 and really flavorful. Both the agua fresca and the horchata are sweet without being too sweet, and very refreshing. I wish I lived closer to Vegas just so I could come back here again!"}
{"text":"Don't be SCURRED to eat at a taco truck!!  Stopped here the other night with some of the Yelp-izzles after Herbs & Rye. It was Jade W, Elnino F, Eleazar A, and I. We couldn't decide on where to go so Eleazar suggested El Pollo Mobile.  None of of has been here before, but we were all happy with Eleazar's pick!  I got 1 pollo taco and 1 carne asada taco. They were only $1 each. There is a bowl of guacamole by the veggies and I put a scoop on each of my tacos. I also ate some of the carrots after I had finished my tacos.  I did not get sick, so the food was definitely clean. I will mos def come back to try some of the other tacos!!"}
{"text":"Second review~ they have a new truck looks way better! they have a letter A ;) so thAt's good to know! My husband always wants to eat from here but I never do had some yesterday and let me tell you were going to eat more of it!"}
{"text":"Best deal in town $1 tacos. Sopes are super delicious. Won't hear a peep out of my son until he finished his Asada fries!"}
{"text":"I can not explain how I'm excited I am to have one of these near me! If you like El Pollo loco for chicken you will fall in love with this place, not to mention their salsa are Awesome! I visited this location for the first time and the service was awesome and quick! 8 piece family meal for $13, you can't beat that!"}
{"text":"This truck always tastes good the only problem that I would say is that customer service sucks the ladies in the front are always talking so snobby and like they just want to get you out of there as fast as I can with no customer service besides that the food is really good I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Friendly service. Vast menu. from tacos to ribs to whole chickens. Zesty Carnitas was my fav. Smokey Pollo was second best. Everything else was okay. My husband and I tried all of the different tacos (except Cabeza aka beef head meat, neither of us were feeling that one lol). Took longer than expected to recieve our order, but it was good. We will go back. Can't beat $1 tacos!"}
{"text":"Best nachos I've had in a while. And tacos. Don't mind the wait for it. Inexpensive. Great food for a great price. Always eat here when passing by"}
{"text":"Just ordered from EPM using UberEATS. Food took longer than I was told but I expected that since they are always busy when I drive past them. We ordered a chicken burrito, steak burrito, and a chicken quesadilla. The chicken was very delicious!!! Super juicy and seasoned perfectly. The steak was good too and not dry at all but our favorite was the chicken. The only complaint we have is they didn't give us any sauce so our burritos were pretty dry without that. Also the quesadilla came with beans and rice on the side and the beans went all over the plate but that was probably inevitable because they were super watery. Over all I would order again but maybe give them a call to make sure they put sauce in my order."}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice in a week. Chicken is delicious and meals are cheap. Ordered a whole chicken which came with rice, beans, and corn tortillas for only $13. Tacos are $1.25 and they give you a lot of meat."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but I can't, and I've given them several chances. They really need to get their stuff together. I've gone here three times for ribs which is on their menu and each time they say they don't have it. So to make sure, I try calling them ahead of time, except their number doesn't work. I make a drive by to place the order around 7 except they were already closed on Friday night even though yelp says 9. I go to the truck again yesterday to place an order of ribs for today. I give them my name and the time I want to pick it up at. Come today, I try to pick up my ribs only to be told they never got the order. How disappointing. I will never be back. They just shouldn't advertise ribs on the truck if they never have it and their lack of communication just lost them a customer."}
{"text":"I like this place the water misters make it feel so fresh the lady taking the orders is also very nice"}
{"text":"Today, I go for a burrito. I was told that the chicken would be done in 10-15mins. The NEW cashier attempted to force me to get another meat. I kindly informed him that I dont eat beef or pork. So I waited 30mins, just for the NEW cashier to tell me that there isn't any chicken. Mind you, it's 1pm. Not only that, SEVERAL people ordered AFTER me and where given chicken within a couple of minutes. Also, the cook brought in at least 15 freshly cooked whole chickens from outside as I waited.. So once again, the NEW cashier attempts to make me take another type of meat. I refused once again and nicely asked for a refund. He walks away tallying to other workers as I wait to be reimbursed. Another 10 mins goes by as I wait for my damn money. By far the worst experience I've ever had there.   There was one instance where I ordered chicken (instead of asada) fries and the cashier handed me a half portion container. I order these fries at least twice a week and this guy swears they've always been this size. My buddy went 3 days ago and got the original larger portion with no issue. I was skeptical after that visit but gave them the benefit of the doubt. After today's visit I will no longer go back. Great food doesn't make up for s****y service. It's truly getting worse."}
{"text":"We Love this place. The staff is Awesome   Its always very clean also the homemade sauces. Green and red. Yummy. Priced to please  and generous portions,  oh man the tacos with green sauce wow. Try it.  This is one of my favorite restauraunts"}
{"text":"First time at this place looks like a very popular spot with the locals. I used the promo for the free horchata and it was very good. The food is made fresh to order. The people are very polite and friendly."}
{"text":"We have stopped at this corner a million times and always say, \"we should try them sometime.\" We finally tried them tonight.... And boy am I kicking myself for not stopping sooner! We got a whole grilled chicken, rice, salsa and veggies for $11. It was amazing. It was the best grilled chicken I have had in Vegas. Simply delicious!  I can't wait to go back again! It is super cheap, fresh, and soooo good!"}
{"text":"Buen serivicio y rapido. Pollo con mucho sabor y a buen precio. Las Asada Fries tambien estan muy ricas. Sin duda regresare muchas veces mas."}
{"text":"Chicken has a really good taste and juicy. Very low price for very good quality. I go here all the time. Highly recommended it!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I first came to to know el pollo mobile when I was driving near rainbow. I saw the smoke coming off the grill and I saw the name of the restaurant nearby. Today I was driving on lake mead, saw the smoke and immediately made a u-turn!! I love discovering new hole in a wall places and I'm glad I went inside. I ordered the $6 dollar 3 piece combo which comes with rice, beans, lettuce, tomato, 3 tortillas, and of course 3 pieces of chicken. The chicken was flat out amazing! For $6 you can not beat that! I will be visiting often and recommending to my friends!"}
{"text":"Good Mexican food & good prices. The employees are nice and cater to your every need. My favorite is the chicken quesadilla , they are like no other ."}
{"text":"Grilled Mexican chicken. Don't waste your money on chemicals in El Pollo Loco's franchised nonsense- go here. Basically the same cuisine, except none of those white-ified salads and avocado-based dishes, and none of the chemicals.  These guys literally throw the seasoning on your meat, toss it on the grill in front of you until it smells like straight-up heaven, then serve it with rice, beans, and tortillas. For rock-bottom prices.   Love their daily specials: Wednesday you can get 12 pieces for like $10, Thursday they offer a 10 piece taquitos deal, etc. That's right: they also do tacos, burritos, and tortas. Everything is well priced, but the chicken is what really shines.  Intro to the salsa bar: not sure it'd bass health code inspection, as the ice has melted to water, but the heat and spice in each sauce probably keeps away both bacteria and the Chupacabra. Suggest the red with chopped veggies and the verde. Be careful of the other red salsa, it might kill your extended family by accident it's so potent."}
{"text":"I live in the apartments down the street and we've been hesitant to try it but we finally did and goosh it was soo yummy!  Mad that it took us so long good food for a good price can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"At first, i saw the smoke, billowing in plumes across rainbow blvd. The sign said, Pollo, Mobile.  \"Ayyy ya hiii hiiiyiooooiiii. Hiyooooiii hhiiiyyooooiiii\" . I was home. Thanks for the best meal in Vegas for three dollars."}
{"text":"$5 tacos or $5 burritos !  The best thing isn't just the simple prices, it's their amazing food. You can taste the quality, they take their time cooking you great food. Their carne asada fries are just $6 compared to their other competitors that sell them for $12. They have huaraches, sopes, huaraches, my favorite is their chicken al carbon. Because it's fresh and grilled outside their restaurant on a carbon grill, just like in Mexico. naturally cooked, and hot and ready.Best chicken in the city."}
{"text":"Smelled great! Friendly service and awesome chicken!!! Definitely coming back! Can't wait to try other items in the menu. Got a whole grilled chicken for $13! Awesome! The prices on tacos and other things are very affordable!"}
{"text":"Chicken done right! Prices are cheap 5.00 dollars for a huge burrito. Doesn't look like much from the outside and the dinning room is old but the food is great!"}
{"text":"The tacos were awesome and authentic. Affordable pricing as well. It's a must stop! Go support this independent business! You won't be disappointed! Yummy yummy food"}
{"text":"Great new small restaurant off sahara and arville.  The chicken is grilledl on mesquite coals. The marinade is a family   recepie.  You find more than grilled chichen.  Menudo, stuffed peppers, Carne asada, BBQ ribs (order those in advance or over the phone). Takes a while to cook.  Fresh orchata and hibiscus waters. Great pices. One dollar tacos. Lots of salsas you choose at bar.  Give it a try and you will never eat Pollo loco again.  All my friends are now addicted to this place, after we finish our games at the park.  Healthy food, inexpensive and the great service (RUBEN cashier)  Thank you for feeding us."}
{"text":"Amazing new restaurant.  The place is spotless, great workers with amazing food at a good price. The chicken is grilled over mesquite charcoal. So juicy. They offer many other choices, Carne asada,  fries, burritos, sopes, and flavored water. The salsa bar is so good an de chilled.  Near eos fitness club."}
{"text":"If you're looking for charcoaled chicken this is the place to go to. This style of chicken has a Mexican style which by far the greatest and delicious chicken I've ever had. You can order by the piece and they have other things on their menu if you're not feeling the chicken. One Saturday's and Sunday's they serve pozole and menudo which I thought was super cool and not a lot of places serve these kind of dishes."}
{"text":"So this is my first yelp review and I'm happy to say this place is amazing! Chicken is grilled all healthy. And for the price, it's a steal not mention the smell of BBQ as you walk up is heaven on earth!! Inside, the staff is super friendly and everything is very clean!!"}
{"text":"The chicken is great, however it is better when 1 particular cook is doing the grilling.  I don't know if the person cooking is responsible for marinating the chicken or not but 1 time when I was there the chicken was magnificent.  Otherwise it's still very, very good.     I have had a few problems ordering.  I'm trying to eat more healthy so I never get the beans or rice.  I just get the chicken and enjoy it with a salad.  Twice I have had issues just trying to get chicken.  Once I asked for 3 pieces, it became a big deal.  They told me I had to order the 3 piece combo, told them I didn't want the rice or beans, a manager was called over and I was told the price would going to be more than a 3 piece combo was.  I was so pissed off I walked out then I came back in and asked if I could by 1 piece of chicken, they said yes.  OK, I ordered 1 piece, paid for it, then ordered another piece paid for it and finally after paying for that ordered another piece.  A lot less than a 3 piece combo.  They felt really stupid.  Similar thing happened once before.  Oh well, at least know I know what to do!!"}
{"text":"Cheap taco truck with good quality.   My coworker and I have been trying to go to this place the past couple months. But it's been hot or too cold. The perfect time to go is that spring gap (one week of Vegas spring).   We finally got to try it out and it didn't disappoint. $1 tacos?! Can't beat that! Ordered the asada, pastor, buche, cabeza and pollo. It comes with the basic cilantro and onions. YOu can grab your own hot sauce in their little station.  The sad part is, people wrote in their reviews that they have a seating area. But when we went, there were none.  If you're in a tight budget and wouldn't mind standing/waiting in the heat. This is the place."}
{"text":"it's very much like eating in Mexico here. Everything's been cooked on the grill outside. Can't wait to eat.  The cheapest and best food we've had so far in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had been driving past this lil spot seeing all the smoke and smelling all the great food for over a month now. So we decided to stop in finally and check it out. Great lil taco spot now we know why there is always a line of people waiting. Flavorful food with fresh refried beans and rice. Will definitely be going back to try other stuff on the menu."}
{"text":"Well first of all everyone just know the free horchata with check in is no longer available so they say. Honestly I think the lady at the register didn't know how to redeem the code, so just be aware of that. Also they don't take debit card which blows my mind, but perhaps the systems were down or something. She referred me to the store next door to take cash out the atm, just be sure to have cash on hand if your visiting this location. Unfortunately this will be the last time for me at this location."}
{"text":"Tacos were good and the chicken yum! I'll go back again. Don't forget to take cash :)"}
{"text":"Last 2 visits great food. Today's visit not so good. Chicken was soggy as like made  yesterday. Beans were cold and rice was dry. Be sure to ask for fresh food, as in made today."}
{"text":"I don't eat meat anymore but they have to have the best $1 tacos. They also have delicious fresh grilled chicken. Can't miss it bright red food truck. 12 piece Chicken special on wed I think 9.99."}
{"text":"1st time here with the Family! Always drive by and see the guy outside grilling the chicken with all that smoke smelling so good. Glad we decided to try it. Really good service and some of the best pollo I've had in a while! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Quiero recomendar esta locación por su exelente servicio y limpieza  Pedi un pollo para comer ahí mismo en compañía de mi hijo   Nos atendió Leo con un exelente servicio al cliente Muy amable y respetuoso  Gracias pollo mobile con mucho gusto les doy mis 5 estrelllas"}
{"text":"I love this place it's the best on the West. Good quality food.  I give it 5 stars because they deserve it"}
{"text":"Absolutely my favorite charbroiled Mexican restaurant!The burritos, tacos, sopes and the two piece chicken plate is awesome I have yet to try the rest of the items but will come back"}
{"text":"Came to this little place on a whim ... And wow! Great tasting food, that was hit, fresh, and fast!   The carne asada fries were layered so the toppings were all throughout the food!   The tacos were juicy and tender!"}
{"text":"Hubby fave chicken joint, but it is now CLOSED!  He calls once a month to see if they reopened somewhere else to no avail..."}
{"text":"Ever since Popeye's stopped offering their Tuesday chicken special, I've been coming here instead for the Wednesday $10 chicken 12pc special. It includes tortillas, rice and beans.  If I'm getting 2 or more orders, I usually call them first so I don't have to wait when I get there. They are located at the corner of Smoke Ranch and Rainbow, across from Shell.   The chicken here reminds me of my family's recipe back home. I like to use soy sauce with some jalapeños when eating this. I like the skin too, it's crispy :-p  Mexican rice is basic but good. No beans for us thank you."}
{"text":"They have really good chicken. The salsa bar is always a bit messy. They also didn't honor their promo that was on their website."}
{"text":"Ok...  Every time that I drive past this food cart I want to just stop the car and run and get some food!  I tried it for the first time about a month ago and have been addicted ever since. They always have chicken on the BBQ and it smells AMAZING!!! yum! My current fave is the canre asada tacos. They are only $1 and are truly amazing.  The only reason why they are getting 4 stars is simply because the last time that I went the salsa was really hot and almost empty.  It was kinda gross. But, since I was going home and I had some there..it didn't hurt my meal.  Besides that... YUM STATUS! If you want some great Mexican food on the go, STOP HERE!"}
{"text":"best taco truck around! 1$ tacos what ever meat that's dope! it's close to my work and i go at least once a week"}
{"text":"Just tried it today. This place is amazing!!! Guys from work kept telling me this place was real good. But would still go get chicken at other places just because it was a known name and wouldn't try this place out. Well I should've came along time ago here... BOMB"}
{"text":"This place is dam good just only thing that suck is it's hot as fuck in there order and get the fuck out"}
{"text":"Everything I had here was amazing! Especially the tostada asada, the flavorful meat melted in my mouth. The rice and beans were bomb. Chicken was grilled to perfection. Corn tortillas piping hot.   The smell of freshly grilled chicken being prepared as you drive by will instantly have your mouth watering. Highly recommended as the menu will satisfy all your Mexican food cravings."}
{"text":"$1.25 for a taco, you can't beat that price! Tasty carne asada, cut clean no fat. Chicken tacos were chunks not shredded. Make sure to bring your own drink, they charge $1 per soda can. Also they charge .50 if your using your debit/credit card."}
{"text":"I've passed by this place all the time and today I decided to go. There's a bbq pit in front that's always smoking where I come from that means they know they're smoking the meat real good! I had the 2 piece combo with rice and beans.  Let me just say the chicken was seasoned and smoked well.  I'm not a beans and rice girl but both were good. I got it tho go but you can sit in to eat.  You can't miss this place there's a huge chicken billboard.  The prices are very reasonable. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch in between meetings and it was awesome! Leo helped me and had a great attitude. The food was amazing! I ordered the Chicken and tortillas and I got to tell you as a black man, this is some of the best chicken I've ever eaten!"}
{"text":"the best chicken around at both there locations i drive from north las vegas every week to buy there whole chicken special with rice and beans for about 12 bucks much better then that other el polo place"}
{"text":"What a gem in Las Vegas! If you want great chicken at an affordable price then this place is for you! I got the 4pcs combo for $7 and some horchata as well. Everything was so BOMB. If you go at the right time you can see the guys grilling the chicken out in front. Be forewarned though, this is a no-frills place that's a little bit in the barrio. Clean place though and really authentic food! The chicken was nice and flavorful with a little bit of spice (heat) added. For the combo you get rice, beans, some veggies and tortillas. Sprinkle some of their homemade salsa onto your food and you will be in paradise. 5 stars all way. Will be back; actually I've been back so I will be back AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Everything is delicious!! Chicken well seasoned beans tasted great but the rice wasn't good, a little hard almost like it wasn't cooked all the way. Staff is very nice. Place was clean."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the tacos here they are always great and so reasonably priced and the staff always has the best customer service. Legit my favorite taco/chicken place"}
{"text":"We ate here a few times !!!!!! me and my kids !!!!!! and we absolutely love it best tacos ever!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Driven by this place many times. Glad we stopped. The freshest chicken in Las Vegas. Ha the street tacos and a 2 piece combo plate. It was amazing. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"It's a great deal, I paid $9 for 1/2 a chicken with rice, beans, side salad, tortillas and a drink."}
{"text":"The best mobile restaurant in town. Friendly staff and very cheap prices. If you want ribs make sure to order them in advance because it takes 35 minutes to cook."}
{"text":"The best chicken tacos!  Fresh and delicious. Salas bar is pretty good too. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"F'ing delicious...everything! Don't let the shanty look fool you. Follow your nose my friends!"}
{"text":"I've been driving by this place for a while and knew that it would be tasty.  The smoke and the aroma is head-turning.  We finally decided to try it one night and the family loved it.  Delicious $1 tacos and grilled chicken that is way better than El Pollo Loco.    We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great prices, clean tables, if you have trouble findimg this place dont give up, look for the smoke. Tacos are dope, burritos are forearm size, carne asada fries are portioned generously. Stop reading and GO!!!!"}
{"text":"Very very disappointed ! Ordered 2 of their special $10 chicken that they have on Wednesday's and was told over the phone the chicken came w/ 12 pieces so figured I'd get 2 orders making that 24 pieces. I ordered in advance and had my husband pick it up he came home and there was only 7 pieces per container ! So disappointed I called them back and let them know how short they were of order and she straight said oh I'm sorry I meant to say that it's 8 pieces for order !"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a solid 4 stars. Grilled chicken, and ribs, over mesquite. Tasty, moist, and unique. I say Unique because food cooked outside over charcoal IS distinct. A great bargain too. A whole cut up chicken/w beans and rice for $12. A full rack O ' ribs for $20. The ribs go fast - so be quick. This review is for Pollo Mobile 2. Across the street from U -Haul, on Rainbow & Smoke Ranch. Just to be clear."}
{"text":"Right next to my work so my coworkers and I eat here a lot. The wait time is ridiculous but it's understandable for fresh food. The staff is super friendly but their English isn't that well. Absolutely love the food and have literally ate here now for a week straight for lunch.  Would definitely recommend to friends and family. I feel this place is better than Robertos at times. Drinks are a bit pricey but again understandable as the food is cheaper but great. Wish they had more of these around town."}
{"text":"We would really like to try this place but they're never open. We've tried to eat here multiple times, closed every time. The website says 9am. We arrived at 1015 and they were still setting up and we were told by the staff we would have to wait another hour. When are they ever open? Can you update your hours on the website or actually be open when you say you're going to be?"}
{"text":"I love how friendly and cleaned and well cooked the food is this place is the best my family enjoys coming her the chicken is the best and the carnitas to die for I well recommend it to everyone"}
{"text":"Everyone that has reviewed got it right on the money. We were just driving down the street and the smell hits you before you even get there. All I could say to my husband at the red light is pull over. I was a little skeptical because it was a food truck, but I pulled it up on Yelp and read reviews and found out it was kinda like a food stand. The tacos are $1 and they give you a lot of meat. My son got a burrito and I didn't hear him talking until it was done! I will be back! You can't beat their prices and great food!"}
{"text":"Hola soy un cliente de muchos anos, y hoy 11/30/17 a las 6:50 pm recoji un pollo que habia ordenado por telefono supuestamente le explico, llame cuando estaba en en el frewey 95 y charleston todo ese tiempo me pusieron en espera llegue hasta la lake mead iva entrando cuando me contestaron, no habia gente y la senorita que estaba atendiendo le dije porque no me contestaron y lo unico que hizo fue darle risa en ningun momento se disculpo le dije ok por lo menos dame unas tortillas extras por la espera y me dijo que si, pague y cuando llegue a mi casa me di cuenta que me las cobro no lo hago por el dollar extra que me cobro si no por la mala atencion por parte de ella, y otra cosa yo siempre tomo de la salsa verde y era mas agua que salsa, tengan cuidado con esos detalles ya que pueden ir perdiendo clientes por causa de empleados inconpetentes, mi orden as : TGYJJ3WTC4H4W Cajero: Ferband Montabez Gracias por su atencion y espero me tomen en cuenta principalmente el manager, por su atencion gracias."}
{"text":"WOW!!!! This is the most flavorful al pastor I've ever had! Tacos are only  $1 a piece and the smoker is always going outside. Seriously, check this place out!"}
{"text":"I have been driving by for awhile now.. Yes finally today was my day.. 2pc combo with a taco on the side.. let me just let you all know my Tummy is so so happy"}
{"text":"I come here for only two things: bean and cheese burrito and carne asada fries. I've tried these two items at many other Mexican joints around town but this is still number 1 for me. The $1 tacos taste okay, but for that price what do you expect.  $0.50 charge for CC/DC"}
{"text":"Place is awesome. Chicken was getting smoked as I ordered. The lady was very courteous and friendly. For $6 bucks, I unlocked a yelp offfer, got a burrito and a 2 piece meal. I'm definitely going back. Very convenient location too."}
{"text":"I've never had bad service here until now. I ordered the Carne Asada fries and four Al Pastor tacos. The meat on the fries was very salty and unpleasant. This is the FIRST time I've ever had a problem. I called and asked if they can remake my order of fries and they said they were closed. This was 5 minutes after we left their location. I live right around the corner and drove down there AGAIN only to be welcomed by taunting comments by the \"professional\" cooks. They already knew that I had called and had CLAUDIA come out. They probably thought I didn't speak Spanish and did not understand what they were saying, but they were wrong and rude. Claudia exclaimed that they did not use salt on their meat, to which I told her to taste it. She literally left WHILE I WAS TALKING TO HER. How unprofessional. She took my receipt inside and told me that they could not put the money back in my account. They instead, gave me cash. No problem. But when I said, \"Thank you\" , Claudia said , \"Yeah.\" I come here at least once a week. Never had a problem until now. I've ordered from here for parties and gatherings before. But not anymore. They try and bribe you with a sign on their lunch truck stating that by posting a good YELP review for them, they'll give you free chicken. That's a smart tactic until someone actually receives bad service. I am extremely upset. And I hope the OWNER contacts me as soon as possible. I'll be waiting."}
{"text":"I was drawn to this place by the $1 Taco sign  Yummy! And Worth $1 , I got 4 tacos and a side of beans and rice. I love the HOT Salsa!  Food was fresh service was very nice and fast and I would recommend. I just wish they stayed open later!"}
{"text":"The chicken was extremely dry all the Salsa's were not marked spicy or mild. The smoke coming in from the grill was extreme my eyes started burn in. the car asada steak was extremely flavorful the burritos were good and the other Specialties were good but do not recommend the chicken it was not fresh that we saw fresh chicken coming in but seem like they gave us hours old dried out chicken"}
{"text":"Chicken smells so good from the outside when they're cooking it but it is unusually dry chicken. The beans and rice were ok but they give u a salad of just lettuce which was odd."}
{"text":"This place looks shady as hell on the outside but it's actually quite decent inside. The food is delicious and it's always packed."}
{"text":"exellent place, food and salsa are very good. especially the chicken is awesome. The jamaica water is great. Tacos and asada fries"}
{"text":"Omg ! What a place ! Just love the food specially the chicken burrito nothing like it ! 100% charbroiled chicken on the grill at the moment, just love it. I recomend this place on price, taste and freshness just love it !"}
{"text":"Drive by here when i come to see my eye doctor. It taste and smells so good. This place is awesome."}
{"text":"The tacos here are absolutely amazing and place is clean. Always fast and good food. Prices are greatttt !!"}
{"text":"Today is the 4th time I've been here. Today my food came out really quick, it tasted fresh. Today I got a Carne asada burrito with beans, cheese, onions, cilantro and rice. It was pretty good but I was not absolutely blown away.  The only two concerns I have had here are it sometimes takes them a little while before someone acknowledges that you're there, and my second gripe is they never have any Pico DE Gallo . I've eaten so much Mexican food growing up in Los Angeles and even travelling to Mexico several times and I never see a place without it."}
{"text":"I was on the hunt for some really good street tacos that was of reasonable price. Stumbled upon this place after passing by a so-called taco truck up the street that didn't seem to be open.  I've always passed this place and it never occurred to me that it was a Mexican restaurant. The giant yellow hat on the roof of the restaurant I guess wasn't very obvious to me.  The cashier seemed to be teaching a little girl, probably 7 years old the register and how to go do certain things. The cashier was ok, figured she'd be more nice when I asked her what huerachas was. She didn't give a very good description and that's why I opted for tortas since I knew what that was already. I ordered some carne asada tacos too. The best part is they're only a $1! The size ain't bad and I figured with the amount I'm paying anyway that would be the equivalent to just one taco elsewhere.   To me the tacos were delicious! I actually came back two days in a row after to get some more. The tacos aren't packed with meat but there's enough inside for each. I tried their pork tacos the second day and they weren't bad either but the carne asada to me are better! Their salsas are great!! I really like the red salsas and especially the chunky one. Very, very good & spicy! And there's just something about the onions, carrots and pepper mixture. I cannot stop eating those onions! It's just so delicious to me I don't get it.   The third day, I had my boyfriend drive me there. I just wanted tacos again but he ended up ordering a whole chicken and it was only $10! It came with rice, beans and tortillas. It reminds me of el pollo loco but different. Their chicken seems to be more of a BBQ/off the grill taste with a bit of spiciness. El pollo loco is more sweet. Overall, very good chicken!   I will be back! This just might be my new taco spot.   I just need to find out what time they close. I don't recall seeing a time on their door or menus.   Took a star off because the service could be a tad better. They don't really greet you or say much when you're about to order. Also, I think it would be nice if they had a menu of the types of meats they have in their tacos or food in general. Chicken, pork, carne asada, etc.. not sure if they have tripe or tongue or anything else for that matter. Maybe I would have to ask next time. I like seeing what my options are I guess."}
{"text":"What can you say? Really good food, AR great prices. $1 tacos! 12 pieces of chicken for  $10 on Wednesday. I live in Los Angeles but visit visit vegas once a month and eat here at least once per visit. What a great fiind."}
{"text":"I'll be craving this place daily back in Cali. The chicken here is SO good! I don't know how they marinade or season the chicken but it's finger lickin good. The inside is smoky, but that's because they grill the chicken right outside the front door. Regardless, this place is worth every dollar. I even loved the beans and rice served on the side. They serve the chicken combos with what seems like 10 pipin hot tortillas. Lol, go get you some!"}
{"text":"I went today for the first time while on my lunch I ordered the 2 piece leg and thigh came with rice beans and lettuce tomato on the side & I couldn't skip the large horchata I had read reviews about lol all for almost 9 dollars. The chicken had really good flavor and the red salsa was really good. I personally love eating a grilled jalapeño with my chicken or meat that would of been perfect. Regardless the food was good and I will definitely be coming back to try their other food items!"}
{"text":"There tacos are so delicious and only a buck a piece.  You can't go wrong.  I've had the chicken, carne asada and the carnitas.  They were all good."}
{"text":"If you've never been here you should definitely try them sometime. I stopped in for lunch. The service was great. The workers were very nice and my food came quick. I ordered three tacos: one asada, one pastor, and one pollo (which are only $1 I might add). They were okay. I liked the pollo (chicken) most out of all which is their specialty. Hints the name.  They weren't the best I've had, but they definitely weren't the worst either. Everything on the menu is fairly priced. They also include tax in all of their menu prices. Definitely the best deal on street tacos in the city. So give them a shot. Its only a dollar."}
{"text":"El Pollo Loco ?? no El Pollo Mobile does it much better Carne Asada BOMB Tacos. I love a good taco place and this is what this place is."}
{"text":"By far the best chicken u could have fresh off a grill.... I don't like the skin of the chicken but when I come here I eat the skin and everything..lol.. that's how good it is.."}
{"text":"The chicken at this place is very good. I always go here and get the 4 piece combo , it is really good!  The chicken taco is also amazing. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is looking for delicious chicken !"}
{"text":"Amazing amazing amazing.  Very pleased every time.  Always got the 4 piece chicken combo until this last trip where I got the Carne asada tacos, both solid choices!  Like the quick to go convenience."}
{"text":"The best grilled chicken ! They season their chicken so good the salsa tops it off since I love spicy food always my go to place and better than pollo loco !"}
{"text":"We were driving around and stumbled across the restaurant on Lake Mead and Lamb.  The smoke from the barbecue caught our attention.  We stopped and went in to find a great menu and prices!  We had the tacos, tostadas and carne asada fritas and all were excellent.  A couple days later, before getting on a plane, we tried to find the restaurant again, we couldn't.  Our GPS did find the mobile truck so we were happy.  We ordered the burritos and whole chicken and they were delicious.  The employees are very nice and they give fast service.  While eating our food near the food truck, we saw people lining up constantly."}
{"text":"The chicken is out of this world. The beans and rice not so much. I haven't tried anything other than the 2pc chicken combo and a Jamaican hibiscus drink, which was also pretty tasty. However, for $5 you can't beat what you receive. This place is worth a try for the chicken alone"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!! The chicken,  the tacos, everything is great!!!! Excellent customer service and location is close to work!!! Very affordable as well!!"}
{"text":"Bomb taquitos!  A must try hole in the wall.  Good food good service, everyone very friendly, even the guy who's bbqing outside."}
{"text":"Yes! Pollo Mobile is where its at. Not really a food truck. Not really a true restaurant. Not even a food stand. Its bigger. It is a trailer with a grill. Oh, and amazing tacos too. They are simple. Two small corn tortillas with your choice of meat with onion and cilantro. Nothing more and nothing less. Tonight I got two each asada and pollo. I can't decide which I like best. They are both so good. Tacos the way I like. Fresh and perfect. At only $1 per taco, it is almost the perfect deal. They are a little small and not too filling. But man are they good."}
{"text":"Great service and great chicken . I have been passing by it for awhile but I never really stopped. Today got chicken , tacos and sopes. All good and has a great taste."}
{"text":"I work right by this place and can smell it everyday! Finally went and ate there with my boyfriend and it was amazing. Very inexpensive with 100% quality meat. We got chicken tacos and carne asada tacos and wanted to go back for more. The salsa taste fresh and home made and the meat is tender and juicy. They were quick and polite and even accepted our debit card with no trouble! We will definitely be going back more often!!!! Delicious food!!!!"}
{"text":"I would recommend the chicken and beans are amazing! I think it's the best home grilled chicken in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Amazing! That's all I can really say! First place I'll go when I'm back in Vegas!! They were so nice even gave us a extra chicken breast and a pop! Can't go wrong with $1 tacos & $12 for a whole chicken!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing they grill the chicken fresh everyday the environment is so nice and the customer service is amazing Ruben on the register is always polite and they take on the phone orders to go pick up in store and they have dollar tacos you can't beat that."}
{"text":"Can I give it 10 stars!!!! The chicken bomb the salsa bomb the carne asada tacos bomb the people and service bomb!!!!!"}
{"text":"One dollar tacos? YASSSS!  We come here because its close to were we live. The name is self explanatory, its a mobile of chicken... and other meats! But, if you come here, get the chicken!  We've tried the carne asada and pollo tacos from here, and while my son love the carne; the pollo is the real winner here! The chicken is so succulent and delicious and perfectly seasoned! The carne, IMO, was just OK. Not horrible, but not the best. The tacos are the real Mexican kind, the soft small tortillas. They also include onions and cilantro if you'd like.  Come and try the deliciousness this food truck has to offer!!  Yasssss!"}
{"text":"Used to come here often but this is the last time. The cashier seemed to be giving everyone the correct change - all bills. When it came to me, all of a sudden she was using her calculator and giving me less change than what I normally should get in bills. Count your change."}
{"text":"Some of the best chicken I've ever had. Subtle spicing, great smoke flavor that you can smell from blocks away with their outdoor BBQ. You can get whole pieces, great tacos, and the best chicken burrito for miles in any direction. Delicious!"}
{"text":"For quality juicy char grilled chicken, here it is. Its like a huli-huli chicken where the blackened skin is not only edible, but desired. Dishes are served with simple rice, refried beans, soft tortillas and shredded lettuce. Horchata and lots of glass sodas to choose from.  Kick it up by notches with their help yourself salsa bar and pickled veggies.  There is large restrooms and air conditioning inside with lots of tables. Small parking lot but alot of street parking."}
{"text":"I can't even drive past this cart without stopping! I used to live right around the corner from it and got hooked right away! I don't live that close to it anymore but I will take the drive from anywhere in town to get to it! LOL I'm not going to say its just soooo different then other carts but they are for sure really good! I like all of the men that usually run the cart and like a past review said, ALL YOU NEED IS $5 TO GET FULL! lol. All in all, THEY ARE MY FAVORITE!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This was first time eating here and the chicken taste good, great price very kind people working in this place, they serve your food in the table. Very clean decent good quality. Parking lot is convenient fast service, if your visiting Las Vegas Strips you should definitely come to this place."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite go to place for delicious chicken tacos !!  I highly recommend this place when you're on a budget ! Been here several times and will continue to come back !!"}
{"text":"Great chicken  Great service  Not to expensive, nice place to have a family meal. Makes me remember my old days In México where I they will have this type of chicken in the girl and every bit of it was delicious."}
{"text":"Their grilled marinated chicken is just a party for your taste buds.  Their tacos de carnitas and asada at a buck each is the best deal in the NW.  Hey you, other more popular taco spots...you got competition!"}
{"text":"Had a craving for more street tacos so I decided to continue on with El pollo mobile. They are open until 11pm Tacos are $1 each I ordered:  2 carne asada  2 carnitas  4 al pastor  Unfortunately all the meat was dry and instead of getting Carnitas they gave me chicken, service was very fast before I could fill up the green sauce containers, the food was ready but they didn't have any radishes, carrots, or onions at the condiment bar. They also forgot to give me limes. Rating 2 stars"}
{"text":"I finally stopped and tried this place after driving past it many times and smelling the fantastic aroma from the giant grill in front of the place. They were grilling some chicken and they had some seats set up while you wait for your order to be filled and can watch TV.....(playing current movies in theaters)....I tried 3 Asada Tacos for $1 each and gave him a $2 tip and all I can say is WOW, they were excellent. Each taco had a large portion of meat and some cilantro and onions and for only $1 each I can say I was surprised at how much they served for such a low price. Put on some fresh salsa and some grilled onions and peppers from the serving tray and feasted on a great meal. Thank you Pollo Mobile, I will be making this a weekly stop now....."}
{"text":"My Boy toy and I were driving around the area and BAM! The smell of the grilled chicken hit my Mexican ass instantly lol We just had to try it and OMG were we happy. We got a full chicken, rice, beans, tortillas and salsa for less than 15$s. I really recommend this to everyone!"}
{"text":"Once I found this spot I was hooked. $1.00 tacos. And it's all made out front. You can smell it down the street. There chicken is no joke. But they also have menudito and pozolito on Sundays. And great family meals! A must try. Better then any other taco shop!!"}
{"text":"Picked up a whole chicken meal on my way home last night. This is a great deal! $13 you get a whole grilled chicken cut up ready to serve. Side of rice, beans, and corn tortillas. Food was super tasty, chicken was cooked very well. This is a good option for a quick dinner. I will have to try some of their tacos next time as this seems to be another popular menu item."}
{"text":"ordered 4 tacos.  2 chicken and 2 carne asada.  There was absolutely NO FLAVOR whatsoever to the meat.  Highly disappointed.   We tried a grilled chicken when they first opened (again no flavor, just the smell of the grill).  Not worth it.  Just go to the market in the parking lot and get meat and do it yourself lol"}
{"text":"Best tacos ever I come here at least 3times a week. I highly recommend the chicken tacos."}
{"text":"Best salsa verde I've ever had!! I could drink the stuff!! I wish they could bottle it, I would buy it!! The tacos are awesome but I usually go for the carne asada torta!! It's $5 and FULL of meat. I always finish it and wish there was more :( My hubby usually gets their cabeza tacos and he loooooves them! It's not in the most awesomest part of town but their meat has better flavor then the taco shops down the block!"}
{"text":"$1 TACOS!!!! Who can beat that?! Not even Tacos Mexico across the street, not only are the tacos cheap but they are deliciosos!!! Also, they are the only ones, pretty much, that serve tacos de pollo  (my favorite). The salsas are uncovered, but who cares they're good!!! The staff is always friendly and funny to talk to. Make sure to bring your piggy banks, cash only."}
{"text":"One of the best places in the city. May not look like much but don't be deceived. Hidden spot for some of the best fresh food with the friendliest staff and neighborhood atmosphere. Stop here when I can. Love it every time."}
{"text":"If this is the place I think it is, its great! We left Vegas on our way to the Valley of Fire, with our \"tour guide\" my brother who has lived in Vegas for 3o years when he asks if we want tacos.  The truck is  on the right (coming from Vegas) next to  the landfill. Just before the landfill on the right if your lucky and its daytime you will see a vehicle that makes the most amazing tacos. I didn't try the burritos but the chicken tacos are great. they are small so order a few., The bulk of their business are truck drivers who like the food so much they call ahead!!  so if you see a truck parked there with a picnic table outside, you are in luck. Get the chicken ones, you wont' be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"One of the worst burritos I've ever had. Asked for avocado but she said they didn't have any. However, my burrito had some type of guacamole & last time I checked guacamole has avocado. She asked if I wanted onions & cilantro, I said no, still got it in my burrito. With what little chicken that was in there, came with pieces of bone. Don't know how the hell this place got 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"I love this place chciken is bomb .com and they actually have really good carne tacos :)"}
{"text":"They're setting up on West  Rainbow and Smoke Ranch and people already lined up. Food smells awesome and the chicken is a must have in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Grilled chicken tacos are yummy, and the chicken is definitely the best thing on offer here, so do yourself a favor and stick to it rather than the other options that aren't as good."}
{"text":"There are very few decent choices anywhere near the base so Yelp helps. I ordered 2 tostadas after seeing a review. The chicken one was amazing! Crisp shell, moist meat, tasty cojita (I think). The carne asada was way to wet. I mean there was liquid in my container. The flavor was we decent but the soggy shell was a big distraction. I say definitely go for the chicken, it is a chicken place after all. By the was the seem to have the cheapest carne asada fries in town at just $6."}
{"text":"Hidden Gem! The food comes out quick, fresh and a good deal for the amount of food they give. The tacos taste like those you would get in Mexico... Authentic! Loved it. And was really good after a night of drinking and gambling!"}
{"text":"While I loves me some Taco Bell there's nothing better than the authentic thing. This place is my go to taco spot. The chicken is super fresh and cooked to perfection and they are quick, unlike other places that take forever to get ur tacos like they went to Mexico to get the chickens lol."}
{"text":"Amazing home made taste! This is the best authentic tasting Mexican food I've had in a while. From the outside I was hesitant to go in but I couldn't resist the smell of the meat cooking on the grill out front! Pricing is great and people here are friendly. Don't let the look of the place fool you, this place is a diamond in the rough!"}
{"text":"Recommended. The best mexican food to go. Always get the steak quesadilla for $6. Big portion food for reasonable pricing."}
{"text":"Um it was okay, I have definitely had better chicken tacos before but you can't beat these for $1.25 They grill whole chickens and chop them up which is cool but do be careful for any small bones, I found 2 in my food.  The tacos are surprisingly a little bigger than expected, I purchased 3 with a steak torta and was stuff after eating $2.50  The torta was meh, tasted okay only real issue is that mine was super soggy, it wasn't a big deal for me but I couldn't finish it even if I wanted to. Took one bite and it fell apart giving up on life.  I'll be back for my next hang over or if I feel like getting full for under 5 bucks."}
{"text":"Smells and tastes amazing! ! Great location and prices. Reminds me of locations in LA."}
{"text":"Tacos are only a buck and very good.  The salsa choices are very very yummy.  Carne asada fries at only $6 are awesome.  Service was very quick, nice interior.  If you pay with card it is .50 extra.  Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I love this place, the grill smell will have you wandering over in no time . Great food fries, tacos. Everything great service."}
{"text":"I love el pollo mobile. It's great. The chicken is delicious and great price. What I didn't like about this location on e lake mead is that the chicken was too salty and it was all dark meat. I called the order in and they said 10 minutes will be ready then when we got there (17 minutes later give or take) it still wasn't ready and The staff was hanging out in the back for a couple minutes talking. I have to say the eastern and bonanza location is definitely my favorite and the staff there is efficient."}
{"text":"Exelente servicio al cliente,  y riquisima la comida. A mis hijos les encanta.  Se los recomiendo 100%. Buen lugar para disfrutar con la familia aqui en el Pollo mobile"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem!  Drove past it several times and smelled the declicious chicken being grilled before stopping by, and boy am I glad I did.  Prices are very reasonable, restaurant is clean, chicken is very fresh/delicious, and the staff is very friendly.  Definitely recommend!  I'll be coming back soon to try the other items on their menu such as carne asada fries."}
{"text":"This place is very clean and very quick with my order staff is very nice ! I highly recommend this location over the rest !!!"}
{"text":"So after Herbs and Rye some of the Yelperazzi wanted to cap it off with tacos. There's so much of them here we could have done a taco crawl, but Elizar noticed a little taco hutch parked by the McDonalds that had a line going steady. Me, Elnino F, Andy T. and Elizar get tacos.  Definitely the crowd isn't the food truck culture crowd, it was straight up all Mexican. Good to me to see a crowd of people eating food from their culture.   The tacos were $1 so I got 2 lengua/tongue and 1 pastor/marinated pork and I got a $1 canned soda (crush or coke). Not bad for $1 tacos! My lengua was soft and flavorful. The pastor was good, but I tend to like when it goes more the savory route and this had a slightly sweeter marinate to it.   I would say it's not for the people who are germ freaks because the salsas are just sitting outside in containers. I say, I have eaten at 3rd world countries some pretty scary stuff and I'm still alive so I really don't get weirded out by little grubby taco stands.  Not quite sure if it's always there, but I think it is. They're open all day 12-12."}
{"text":"There chicken is the best I would have given them a 5 star but there was bones inside my chicken taco. And this is not the first time it happens all the time. I hate to give bad reviews but it's the only thing that they need to fix it's not good on biting on the bones. I promised will give you guys a 5 star once that's taking care off."}
{"text":"$1 tacos less than a block away from the house. Is it fancy? NO, but the tacos are excellent. These are awesome little carne asada tacos with cilantro and onions. It's a food truck in the parking lot of a car wash.   They grill whole chickens in the parking lot and you can get one for $10 for 12 pieces of chicken. There's a tv hooked up in front of the food truck and on most given nights it's playing soccer. The tacos are tasty, fresh to order and cheap. Seating consists of 4 folding chairs in the parking lot while you wait to take your tacos home."}
{"text":"Walked in and the person at the order count was putting napkins in a holder, after 45 seconds finally acknowledged me.  I wanted to try the BBQ chicken put was told it wasn't  ready for at least 30 minutes. No sorry, just that's the way it is type of attitude.  I ended up at El Pollo Loco, and that's where I will go to in the future."}
{"text":"They say it's the best charbroiled chicken! Well from my experience today they are not the best! My chicken was burnt and the chicken had no good flavor. I was disappointed and will not come here again. The service was fine, place was clean. Just food was ok."}
{"text":"This place is 5 minutes away from my house. We pass this place all the time. It's a hole in the wall. But you can see them grilling chicken outside.  Right in front of the restaurant.  It smells so good. One day we decided to stop by after seeing the Comercial on TV. I Bought the Carne Asada Burrito And my Brother Got the Carne Asada Fries. Manninn where we happy.  We now go at least 2 a week. We've had pretty much everything on the menu. The food is excellent and the prices are decent.  5$ for a fat Carne Asada burrito.  Cmon. 6$ Carne Asada fries.  You can't beat that. We always call our order in by the time we get there the food is ready. Then we go across the street and get a 44 oz Soda at Circle K for .79 cents."}
{"text":"This is the most delicious grilled chicken you can get in Vegas. I have lived in Tijuana and Puebla Mexico, so I am familiar with the taste of authentic Mexican food. The price is very good as well. I am really glad to have found this restaurant. Also, the tacos are very delicious as well. The meat is flavorful and cooked exactly how I like it."}
{"text":"Definitivamente recomiendo este lugar por su comida tan exquisita no me arrepiento de a verlo visitado"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service.  My family and I were so excited to try this restaurant as it smells so wonderful when you drive by.  We went inside to order and the female employee at the register did not acknowledge us.  Mind you, I am very light skinned and die my hair blonde, and I am Hispanic, and my family is all Caucasian.  We were discriminated against as she skipped over us to help others and must have assumed I don't understand Spanish, as she spoke about my family and I to a stranger."}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot for Mexican food and the grilled chicken is amazing... I definitely recommend anyone that loves good food come here..."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my sada fries one of my favorite lunch spots! I love how they cook the food fresh on the grill! I mess w the east side."}
{"text":"FYI... Health department just gave them a poor rating on sanitation standards."}
{"text":"Hands down my standard place for Mexican food. Great quality Mexican food at amazing prices! Always recommend it to family and friends whenever they're looking for Mexican food! 5/5!! Go for the burrito, tacos or carne asada fries- you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"This location is not as efficient as other locations. The lady taking the orders in the front can be kind of rude sometimes. Overall they offer good food at good prices, but this location needs focus on customer service a bit more when compared to their other locations"}
{"text":"Amazing chicken, love walking up and seeing & smelling the grilled outside. If you get to go be sure to ask for salsas, we didn't get any. Carne asada fries are the best! Lots of meat & toppings! Will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"This is the best chicken ever, I Drive all the way from California once a month to eat here. The chicken is cooked on the grill and the people are courteous. I recommend this place to any one that visit Vegas"}
{"text":"I had tacos today. They are very very dry. Al pastor has a very strong flavor that is not pleasant. Buche was very good that's why I gave them some stars. Service is slow."}
{"text":"Great service. Good food and I recommend this place to everyone. Check it out. The place is not difficult to spot from the street. Great selection of drinks too."}
{"text":"Im a fan!!! Best street style tacos and dont forget their Wednesday's $10.99 special for 12 pcs of thighs and legs with rice, refried beans and tortillias.  Check them out, tasty grilled chicken prepared on the grill and straight to your plate!"}
{"text":"You can't beat the prices for the taste - Fresh grilled right out front so you are going to pick up some grilled chocked smell just like in your own back yard cook out - Delicious $1.00 tacos and you can't beat the $5.00 combos - You'll keep coming back just like I do"}
{"text":"Great service and fresh food. Loved the prices and the cooked grilled chicken outside the store"}
{"text":"The food is good but the wait time is a JOKE 20 minutes for 6 tacos.. need to hire some help"}
{"text":"It's almost midnight, fireworks are still popping, husband is snoring...and all I am thinking about is, where them tacos at tho'?! Since eating it isn't going to happen anytime tonight, I might as well type about it. Fun!  I seriously would give this place 5 stars becuh-uhhzz...Street tacos for a dollar!!! Legit street tacos for a dollar! Come on, you can't beat that! Unless someone got super competitive and marketed their street tacos for .99cents! My review is a late one, typical, but I just can't give them the 5 stars because when we arrived, their salsa bar needed attention. Like how you know you're going to have to be the one to change the toilet paper, but instead...you grab barely enough sheets so that the next person is stuck with one sheet to wipe and the obligation to change it.   I failed to make the connection, but leave it to me to put tacos and toilet paper in a story. Salsa bar, yes, needed cleaning and needed refilling. Husband was disappointed there wasn't any of those pickled vegetables, yet, failed to let them.know. Look, our job that evening was to eat. Didn't feel like being inventory control specialist as well. Lol.   I ordered chicken tacos because upon pulling into the lot, the smell.of.rotisserie chicken was magnetic, so I suckered in. It did not disappoint me at all. The tacos aren't Roberto sized tacos, just to put it into perspective. They're more on the mini sized, but certainly worth the dollar!!! The husband pretty much went down the menu and he enjoyed it all. Surprise-Surprise.   Remember...Street tacos. Cilantro and onions. Don't go crying when you don't see guacamole, pico, and all the other jazz in your dollar taco. And for a dollar?! Heller.  No tables so eat it in your car, on the hood, in the trunk,   or in the car with your legs dangling out of the door like any respectable dollar eating street taco person would. =P"}
{"text":"Normally this is the first place that I see and or smell when I come home. The last few times the level of service has been horrible and today was another bad day...I guess. Last week  I paid for and ordered 6 pollo tacos with everything. I have been here several times before with no issues. Unfortunately I forgot to check my order before I left. Ultimately I got less of what I paid for ( 4 tacos ) and upon return to fix my order for the mistake I was greeted with disgust for requesting the correction. So I guess the lady at the window remembered me and the food was no less than charcoal when I received the Wednesday Special of 12 pieces of chicken for $10, as well as the 6 tacos had more onions than chicken with no cilantro. I returned the food and asked for a replacement to be told that I can't have anymore. She was very hesitant to return my money as well. It will be a while before I return to this establishment.  The sad part is that the food that I ordered wasn't even for me. I bragged about how good the food is to a friend and ordered it for him."}
{"text":"This place is the best.. I come here 3+ times a week.. have to try the chicken tacos!!"}
{"text":"The food smells really good from the outside because they grill it outdoors. But when you eat in the food taste like cardboard and the service is really bad. Expect to wait for a long time for your food even if there is nobody in line. Price is okay but really a disappointment"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places only had one issue with them and it wasn't enough to stop a 5 star rating , food is delicious and love the fact it's charbroiled and at a exceptional price .  Wish they were open a little longer though for us late night people but aye still can't complain. Lol Favorite thing to eat is the Carne Asada fries but I always substitute for the chicken . Both are really great as well as the tacos ."}
{"text":"Come here all the time, service is quick and polite, food is delicious and free salsa station with great fresh sauces. Love this place."}
{"text":"Excellent chicken! Loved the posole too but wished it came with cabbage. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I recently discovered this delicious, affordable, and quick-serving spot near my work. Every item/entree I've tried is great, especially the chicken piece combos; each one comes with a side of rice, beans, and tortillas. The salsa sides are surprisingly tasty as well. The only issue I've encountered is the limited amount of parking, so you might have to park on the street curb. Other than that, I've found an excellent pollo place that I'll be adding to my regular list of weekly work lunch locales!"}
{"text":"Place sucks. The chicken is mostly burnt with hardly any meat. And food is honestly not that great at all. All the smoke in the air kills the appetite."}
{"text":"The smoke billowing into the sky with the inviting smell of meat on an open flamed grill is very inviting. DONT BE FOOLED!! It took over 40 mins to get 13 tacos and 1 Torta. Mind you the taco has very minimal meat. I will never order the Torta again. The bread was to soft and barely toasted the meat was sloppily thrown into the untoasted bun with cilantro onions and cheese aaaannnnd 2 tomato slices the size of golden dollar coins. The best part of that Torta was the cilantro. I would go back to get tacos, but probably at a less busy time."}
{"text":"I love this place. The chicken is amazing. Great prices for tacos. Good salsa bar. I wish they had a thick spicy verde sauce that's all they are missing.  The young cashier up front knows me everything I order. He is a great asset to the business."}
{"text":"Oh no.... This food truck was so bad that I could even don't finish my sandwich! Sure I will never stop there anymore."}
{"text":"Great service, great food & good times. The Carne asada & chicken are cooked to perfection. I recommend this place for breakfast, lunch & dinner.  :-)"}
{"text":"amazing sopes!! amazing burritos!! amazing quesadillas!! amazing everything!!"}
{"text":"Great $1 tacos! Especially the cabeza! Their grilled chicken is also very very flavorful and delicious. Wish they had lengua tacos though"}
{"text":"This place was hella tasty! We ordered the whole chicken (8 pc) meal and chicken tacos. The service was good and the food came out very fast. The chicken was grilled very nicely and the sides were yummy, however the beans were very soupy... I don't know if it was just a bad batch or if that is their recipe since this was our first time eating here, but I didn't really dig the consistency (I just mixed my rice in and all was right with the world.) Also my Horchata was watered down - hence 4 stars, not 5.   I will definitely eat here again and try something different next time."}
{"text":"The location is amazing. The chicken is ALWAYS fresh. I know this because they are always grilling it on the huge BBQ outside. Definitely a must try."}
{"text":"Excellent chicken tacos and a bargain at $1.  Cooked fresh on charcoal which guves the meat a nice smoky flavor.  Hard to beat.  Lighter Red sauce and green sauce are both fantastic."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food chain I've ever had. There salsa is so f****** good. I love how good this place is. I've never had a bad experience here. I wish they would bring there dollar tacos back. But still having it at 1.25 is still lower than any other Mexican food place. The chicken is so damn amazing here I can't even imagine someone saying it's gross."}
{"text":"I love this concept. From the ridiculously great smell of char-grilled chicken, to the fast and friendly service inside the restaurant, this spot has easily become a family favorite. I normally get a full chicken combo which is $13 and it includes rice and beans as sides. Although the sides are small, and I normally order one or two extras, they taste great. They are conveniently located in the same plaza as EOS fitness, so it's a great snack after the gym. Kudos to you Pollo Mobile. Your chicken and salsas are now a part of our weekly lives."}
