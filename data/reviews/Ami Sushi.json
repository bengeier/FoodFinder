{"text":"The lobster (scampi) tempura and sashimi were were almost too pretty to eat--but it's good we got over that because tasted great. The chicken teriyaki: delicious and fun. Cheerful service made the meal very enjoyable. If I lived in Oakville, I'd be coming back repeatedly."}
{"text":"I ordered take-out from here and got the ami house roll, hamachi neki roll, mixed vegetable roll, fire dragon special roll, and soba noodles. My favourite is the mixed vegetable roll they taste delicious! The tuna, salmon, and eel tasted very good. The yellow tail in the hamachi neki roll was ok but not great. The soba noodles are good."}
{"text":"Consistently good and fresh.  Good variety of specialty rolls and nice private rooms (but make a reservation if you're set on getting one).    The food is great, but service can be slow - take out can be a good option."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm just a sucker for friendly service, but I enjoy the Sushi Ami experience.  It's close to the hotel I stay in when I come to Oakville, and I always find the food quite fresh and good.  They make a killer salad dressing (which they also sell), and though the portions tend to be small for the price, I come from a land-locked state, so I'm used to sushi being a little pricey.  The first time I went it was a slow night and the chef made me an extra dish of sauteed scallops which I wasn't charged for--a nice treat which made me want to come back."}
{"text":"Me and my friend are both huge fans of sushi so we thought we'd try out this restaurant in Oakville for lunch.    The fish was very fresh.  As at most sushi restaurants, you can watch the chef prepare your meal.  They ran out of one item on their menu so we had to substitute for another.  The food and service were both pretty good, but nothing spectacular.  The prices were reasonable for a sushi lunch, but I have had larger portions for a better price at other restaurants.    The parking lot was full and it's a tight squeeze getting in or out.  I believe there's additional parking in the back if you don't want to fight for a spot."}
{"text":"Dropped by this restaurant as we were near the GO station and craving a spot of sushi. Monday night was slow (one other couple in the restaurant) so we were served immediately and our food arrived very quickly!  Our waitress was really sweet and polite. Service was a solid 5/5.  I ordered the chicken katsu dinner set (comes with rice, salad and miso soup.) The rice was a bit soggy but everything else was fine. For the price, you definitely get value for money - portion sizes were great! Tasty chicken katsu   My boyfriend ordered the kamikaze roll, which says spicy but isn't really- it's more like spicy mayo that's drizzled across the top. (Still tastes rly good tho!) They offered my boyfriend miso soup and salad on the house too which was really nice!!   They also served us little orange slices while we waited for the bill which was a nice touch.   Overall I really liked this restaurant, it's a nice and quiet little place in a great location - if you're waiting for a train, come a little earlier and stop by for dinner!"}
{"text":"I'm kind of surprised that this restaurant has such a low rating but that's what you get with little reviews. This is actually the first place I ate at (on my birthday) when we moved to the GTA. (It's difficult to find a place to eat in Oakville unless you know where you're going.) Ever since, my fiance and I order just-eat.ca from Ami Sushi ALL THE TIME! We have tried every Japanese restaurant in the deliverable area and continue to go back to Ami due to the freshness of their fish. Granted the only time I have actually eaten in house was on my birthday last year, but they still had excellent service. (And gave me a free treat for my dessert!) I'll continue to visit here for my sushi needs (yes, there are needs). My favorite continues to be their housemade salads and spicy tuna roll. Can't go wrong with the throw backs."}
{"text":"This review is based on takeout only since I have never eaten in the restaurant.   After having a real craving for sushi I walked in and read the takeout menu. I ordered assorted veggie tampura, salmon sashimi and spicy salmon roll.   The tampura was great! Not soggy or greasy.   The sashimi! Now that's where it's at. It was extremely fresh. No awkward fishy taste and was sliced not too thin, but not too thick.   I didn't love the spicy salmon roll and didn't end up finishing it. There was way too much spicy mayo on it. I couldn't actually taste the salmon. Not only did the mix the salmon with the spicy mayo, they also out a bunch on too. Just way too much for me.   I will most likely go back purely based on my sashimi experience, but will tell them to go light on the spicy mayo."}
{"text":"Ate there for the 3rd time this past week.  Very good atmosphere (even if the surrounding area is less than appealing - across from GO station).   Staff very friendly and attentive, and the food very good quality."}
{"text":"This quiet place is located right across from the Oakville Go station.  The service is always friendly.  Although if you are ordering takeout I would recommend calling in advance, because they take about 30 minutes to prepare your food depending on what you order.    The quality  of food is great, well at least the maki rolls are.  My girlfriend and I always order the rolls (dragon, spicy tuna, unagi etc).  They are amazing, but pricey.    I would recommend coming here for a quiet dinner with a friend or date.  Also, great for takeout.    Derek"}
{"text":"Some of the very BEST sashimi I have ever had!!! I love the salad filled with samples of every raw fish they have! I have been here at least 3 times a week during my weekly stays."}
{"text":"Delicious and super friendly at a reasonable price. Ami keeps it consistent and fresh and they really try hard to please you, throwing in extra freebies. They also make their roles extremely fast for takeout, no need to call ahead!"}
{"text":"Food is great and service is good too. We go for dinner after work so it's really quiet. You must try the caterpillar role. it is delicious. I have always had a great experience here and will go back."}
