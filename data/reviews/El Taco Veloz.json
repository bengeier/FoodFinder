{"text":"Good food, but literally the WORST service I have ever gotten in my life. I'm usually very understanding when I get back service, because I was a waitress. This time there was no exception! We had to ask at least three times for everything we needed. Then they ran out of chips, which she didn't tell us, but proceeded to bring guacamole to the table; then she argued not to take it off the check. Horrible experience, I will NEVER go back."}
{"text":"The Chori-Cheese Dip was EPIC! If you want some REAL Mexican food, go to this place for sure! Everything we had (and everything we saw coming out of the kitchen was AMAZING). The tortilla chips were hand made and fresh and so crispy, it was just perfect...and from the words of someone who loves all things Mexican cuisine (my fiancé) go here and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were slightly skeptical about coming to El Taco Veloz only because of the location. This section of North Tryon can be a little bit sketchy, but we instantly regretted judging the book by its cover once we had eaten here. I ordered three tacos with carne asada (grilled steak) and they were fantastic. My girlfriend got the carne asada (it's the same meat, just not on tacos and also comes with rice, beans, etc. The service was great! friendly staff who check up on you the perfect amount of times. These were genuinely the best tacos I've found in the university area! Don't go to Monterrey, Zapatas, etc. El Taco Veloz is so much better."}
{"text":"Super nice  staff. Food was decent , excellent tostada but not  a lot of options for a vegetarian.  My husband had a shrimp dish, liked it but would have enjoyed the dish more  if the tails had been removed."}
{"text":"This must be our 25th visit here. My wife and I love this place. The food is good and reasonably priced. They do have a few unusual items on the menu ( cerviche and grilled cactus plus a few more). The service overall is good. Having been here so many times we have had a couple of visits where the service has been less than good, but that is not the norm. Come try it,  you will be glad you did"}
{"text":"So yummy. Carne Asada served with roasted onion and roasted jalapeno was out of this world. New favorite Mexican restaurant in Charlotte. Sorry,  Three Amigos, you just got bested."}
{"text":"Seriously ghetto outside the door with lots of guys just hanging around, but don't be deterred. The food is actually good. They bring two salsas and three little cups of various hot sauces that are all interesting and tasty. The chips are thin and warm. Husband was happy with the lunch steak fajitas. Freshly made warm corn tortillas were served with it. I asked for veggie fajitas with onion and tomato only. It came with green beans, corn, peas, peppers, onions and tomatoes. Which should have been great, but it was a little odd. Not the flavors I expect in a fajita. On the plus side, most of the veggies were clearly fresh (not canned). 

There were about 6 menu options containing eggs, but I'd never heard of most of them so I didn't know if they had meat in them. Other than those possible egg dishes, there was nothing vegetarian on the menu. So that makes it a bit difficult if the server doesn't speak English well. 

Despite all this, I'd probably come here again at least for the salsas."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and it is great.  I have come for lunch and the prices are super cheap for delicious Mexican food.  I usually get the chicken quesadilla while my wife usually gets some fajitas.  It is always amazing.  The chips and dip they give you for free at the beginning of the meal are great as well.  The queso dip is absolutely amazing.  If you are looking for great food at a cheap price, this is THE place."}
{"text":"Salsa and chips were delicious, and the entrees were pretty good but the service was bad. Waited almost 15 mins before a server came to our table. They also messed up my order twice but I think it was due to the language barrier which I can understand. It's also not the cleanest restaurant but I would go back for the food."}
{"text":"I don't usually write review but I thought I should share my review. My Family and I went to this restaurant to try them out since we are new to charlotte. Even though the food was okay there customer service was rude the young lady that was first serving us was nice but the other ones was rude. When we left we went to our car my daughter went back In cause she left something in the bathroom. One of the waitress a older lady came up to her and told her that it was rude for us not to leave them a tip. And scolded my daughter about that it was our obligation to leave tips. I'm sorry but tips are a blessing not an entitlement and you differently you never talk down to anyone Child . My husband and I was so upset and wanted to go back in there and say something, but we are not those kind of people and two wrongs don't make a right . So we walk away... SO BEWARE OF THIS BUSINESS!!!!

No suelo escribir crítica, pero pensé que debería compartir mi crítica. Mi familia y yo fuimos a este restaurante para probarlos ya que somos nuevos en charlotte. Aunque la comida estaba bien el servicio de atención al cliente era grosero la señorita que era la primera vez que nos servía era agradable, pero los otros fue grosero. Cuando nos fuimos fuimos a nuestro coche mi hija fuimos en causa ella dejó algo en el baño. Uno de la camarera una señora mayor vino a ella y le dije que era grosero para nosotros no dejarles un consejo. Y regañó a mi hija acerca de que era nuestra obligación de dejar consejos. Lo siento, pero los consejos son una bendición no un derecho y de manera diferente que nunca hablar con nadie Niño. Mi marido y yo estábamos tan molesto y quería volver allí y decir algo, pero no somos ese tipo de personas y dos equivocados no hacen un justo. Así que nos alejamos ... así que ten cuidado con este negocio!"}
{"text":"Have been their twice and the food is excellent..  The plates are huge.  Food came prompt with warm nachos and queso,  salsa  Verde or roja.  The baby even liked the beans.  I want to try their huge family meal.  Husband is scared of spicy but he had plenty options.  Bathrooms were clean and neat.  Loved it. Going back  soon"}
{"text":"By far the best Mexican place I visited in Charlotte. Authentic food with live music in the evenings. Their chips sms salsa are the best."}
{"text":"The food is good.  However, the service is just down right HORRIBLE.  The staff gathers at the bar talking.  You sit there clearly out of your beverage but no one stops to refill it.  You have to ask for more chips & when the waitress brings it, she reaches over your plate & sits it down.  Not one time saying excuse me please or anything.  Then on top of that she clearly sees you do not have any salsa in which she has 2 on her serving tray but doesn't give you one nor does she ask.  After about 20 minutes after we finished our meal, we are still waiting for the check.  This has happened on several occasions.

On another occasion, I stopped by for LUNCH.  I ordered from the LUNCH Menu.  When the check came, I was charged for the Dinner item.  When I questioned the waitress, another waitress came over to explain that she had charged me for the Dinner item because my waitress did not tell her that I wanted the LUNCH item.  She said because I was given a DINNER portion, I would have to pay that amount for the Dinner.  The miscommunication was between the 2 waitresses not me."}
{"text":"Love this place... Never once have I been disappointed... And on Wednesday is dollar beers... Who can beat that!! Tortillas are fresh made, you have the option of chips with different dips or what I like to call hang over soup... Either choice is great!... I have gotten the tacos and it is authentic, but most times I get the carne asada plate and I love it... A lot of food for the price and I am always taken care of... Would recommend to anyone looking for great Mexican food in the university area! It's a hole in the wall, which is how I like my Mexican restaurants... I hate chain restaurants... This is down home good food!"}
{"text":"Arrived at 9:41pm, lights & open sign flashing, & the doors locked????  3 employees are looking at me like deer caught in the headlights.

If you say open until 10 then stay open until 10 or find new employees!"}
{"text":"Our server didn't speak much English but she was kind. Some people might be intimidated by the location but the food is really good. The tacos are affordable and delicious (3-4 of them fill me up) so less than 10 bucks for a meal."}
{"text":"Soooo ummmm... my girls were wondering why I chose this spot. I honestly didn't know it was so close to the hood. My resident Charlottean friend enlightened me on the proximity and frankly I didn't care. I got street cred (not really). But it was worth the risk. 

Now I won't run home and tell my mama about the food, but I can say the salsas and dippings are gooooood. I honestly could have just come for this. I can't exactly remember what I ordered for a meal, but clearly it wasn't that memorable cuz I remember food. Trust!

I'm sure I'll go back... probably with my dude tho (he's got street cred... no forreal he does) at least for the salsas and chips. My main staple is nachos cuz it has everything I want on it, so I'll try that out and report back... over and out!"}
{"text":"Came here with a couple of the guys after looking for an authentic Mexican restaurant in Charlotte. The staff didn't know much English but besides that everything was amazing."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant in the University area; if there's some place better let me know. Instead of the ubiquitous chips & dip you can get a chorizo & bean soup that is light and flavorful; it doesn't fill you up like chips will. A good choice if you are watching what your weight, although if not you can get the chips with come with a queso dip, a thinned out guacamole and salsa.

Their pork carnita's are just divine; big chunks of perfectly cooked  pork,  nicely charred on the outside and tender and flaky on the inside.

They bring you a plate with three different salsa and  pickled onions. Sometimes you get what I think is a house pickled jalapeno - it is cut in strips and much firmer than the usual canned jalapenos you get elsewhere. You get a generous serving of radishes, which go with the meat in their house made tortilla's beautifully. Never seen that anywhere in Charlotte, although it is common in LA.

If you don't want to be overloaded with carbs you can order three taco's off the menu. They come in many varieties and are dressed simply with onions and cilantro. Add some of their grilled cactus and you can fill up for about the price of any of their other entries without the excess carbs.

Most of the time the service is pretty good, everyonce in a while you may get a waitress that is kind of slack, but I can overlook that for delicious and authentic food at great prices."}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience.  The food was well prepared and well seasoned. I got the shrimp enchilada which what is terrific. It was covered with cheese and Verde sauce. The chips are served with three sauces which is a great touch. The service was very friendly. This will be my go to Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"I was craving tacos, in that annoying slightly drunk way: \"Guuuuyyss I have to eat tacos.\"

So off we went.

Tacos in a strip mall? Yes please. Their tacos are cheap and they serve quite a variety.

My favorite was the beef tongue but they have chicken and lots of options for you scaredy cats out there.

Queso was super interesting and a large serving. Salsas were great too- if you are in the area want some authentic offerings are just cheap tacos open late, pull into this shopping center parking lot."}
{"text":"GREAT FOOD! Nice atmosphere. Nice bar. Best Mexican joint in the area."}
{"text":"They had a great sauce bar!  ...and this place was SO authentic!  I just loved the restaurant and the food.  I can't wait to go back to Charlotte to eat here again!"}
{"text":"Muy buena la comida y servicio rápido. Aunque haya mucha gente, Disfruto venir los domingos a comer con mi familia."}
{"text":"Excellent, authentic Mexican food. They were friendly and the service was fast. I will definitely done here again the next time I am in town. We had tacos and a quesadilla. They bring complimentary chips to the table, along with cheese dip and three kinds of salsa."}
{"text":"If you are looking for authentic mexican food, you have found it! This is the only place in the Charlotte area that I have found to actually be authentic! My husband is from mexico and he even agrees this is not just some americanized or texmex food! I am very impressed by the quality and portion sizes here and I have been here numerous times and will continue to return! The staff are all latina ladies that don't speak much English, but they sure know good food! The customers are usually all hispanic which is another good sign that this food is delicious!"}
{"text":"More like Taco Despacio! Let's not kid ourselves. I waited TWENTY MINUTES to be able to put in a to go order and then THIRTY FIVE minutes to get my order. Not always this bad, but Sundays (and other days) are zoos.

I'm a big fan of this taco shop and so are most of the Latin people living in Charlotte apparently because it is so so so busy especially on Sunday and especially on Thanksgiving. The service and response time was so painfully slow on Thanksgiving that I decided to lower my star rating to A4 even though it's really 5 quality food. I don't like to reduce based on service but this was particularly bad. Having said that I do really love the parts here and if my experience next time is better than it will go back up to 5.

And it's real Mexican food. And that's what really matters. Forget that hipster fake Mexican stuff near downtown. You know the one I mean. Just forget it."}
{"text":"Keep in mind - I leave this \"as good as it gets\" by Charlotte standards :)
I am BORN AND RAISED Arizona, and within the past 18 months moved to Charlotte,.. Luckily I found this gem early on in my relocation, and it is THE BEST and CLOSEST thing to \"legitimate Mexican\" food as I possible --- and trust me, I have SEARCHED and been disappointed. It is about a 25 minute drive from our house, but we go here every chance we can.
It is the most legitimate Mexican food (and we are often times the ONLY Caucasian people in the place, which is a good sign to us). We love the service (although can be \"slow\" to American standards).. you just have to ask for things. 
My fiance always gets the fajitas, and I always get the pastor tacos (I tried a few others, and that is my favorite). Salsas are good, as well.
If you are looking for the CLOSEST thing to \"Mexican\" food (by Arizona and Mexico standards), THIS IS IT!! (even their TV's are in Spanish / Spanish soap operas)!"}
{"text":"Here are a few indicators that you're at an authentic Mexican Taqueria: 
- there's Mexicans eating AND drinking beer! 
- they serve REAL Horchata! 
- the service isn't stellar 
- the food is! 
- Tacos are under $2.50
- yes, they stare, but they're harmless 
- and you're most likely in a dangerous neighborhood. 

And without a doubt we'll be back! The food was EXCELLENT! Yea so the service doesn't come with a smile, but who cares! I'm there for Tacos not smiles! The Horchata was delicious, the chips were authentic and hot, the tacos are $1.99 and are stuffed with meats! 

Easily the best Mexican food I've had since moving here from Miami!"}
{"text":"Best tacos around, at a great price. I've tried other menu items as well and everything is delicious - but you can't beat their deal on tasty tacos!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Fresh salsas and soft corn tortillas were the best. We enjoyed the live band on Saturday night. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food here is really good but hard to over look the poor customer service. The service is super slow and our server was no where to be seen after our food arrived at our table. At the end we had to ask 2 different servers for our check. After 20 minutes we had to finally track our server down to pay.

There were 5 of us so we decided to order carnitas and the Molcajete, which is big platter to share. This platter comes with your choice of 3 meats, rice, black beans, salsa, fried cheese, cactus, grilled onions, tortillas and grilled jalapeños. We agreed on the marinated pork, grilled chicken thighs and steak. 

The food was delicious, just really slow service."}
{"text":"Finally found a place that has authentic pupusas and asada tacos... I should've not gotten their long island iced tea, becuz it wasn't so good... but the food here is GREAT!!! My first time visiting, and it will not be my last!!! If a Cali native can say the food is good, best believe it most be..."}
{"text":"My husband and I found this place after purchasing a gift certificate from restaurant.com.  It is in a strip mall south of I-85 near a chinese restaurant and a Family Dollar.  The decor is pretty \"Mexican restaurant kitsch\".  I noticed that there was a bar, but we sat near the door and didn't venture further into the restaurant, so I couldn't comment on the bar.

We were presented with menus by a woman who seemed nice, but obviously spoke no English.  She pointed to the drinks, and waited expectantly.  We both ordered Cokes, and they arrived quickly, along with 2 bowls of a spicy soup with sausage, beans, and vegetables.  I don't know what it was called, but it was YUMMY.  

Another waitress came to take our order.  This place has an extensive menu!  Most of the items have english translations on the menu, but not all of them.  I noticed everything from your standard tacos and tortas to beef tongue, octopus, and several types of ceviche.  

We both ordered the \"Tres Compadres\" platter for 14.50.  It comes with a pounded chicken breast, 2 pieces of skirt steak, and 4 grilled shrimp.  The shrimp was slightly overcooked, but seasoned well.  The chicken and skirt steak were FABULOUS.  Flavorful, tender, and juicy.  The plate also comes with a large serving of rice (also tasty) and homemade tortillas.  The entire thing was excellent.

We shared an order of flan for dessert.  It was dense, and tasted faintly of cinnamon.  My husband commented that my flan is better, and more smooth.  Theirs wasn't bad, although it had very little of the caramelized sugar sauce.

In all, we spent about $17 before tip (after the $25.00 GC), and we were thrilled.  We intend to bring my in-laws in for a yummy, casual lunch."}
{"text":"Great food and wonderful staff. Prices are very affordable. During the week it's not too crowded but weekend are more busy. Live mariachis are great."}
{"text":"If you only read the first sentence of this review, you should know - the food is to DIE for. Some of the best Mexican food I'll ever put in my mouth. I'd even say it's the best Mexican food in Charlotte. Unfortunately the service sucks. Sucks some big ones. But the food is so good. It takes forever to get the food, but the food is so amazing. Did I mention the food is tasty?"}
{"text":"I love Mexican food,  and this place topped the charts.  It was fresh and came out promptly.  Would love to go here again."}
{"text":"This is one of my neighbor spots, the grilled chicken salad is awesome, which comes with soup.  This is a little different from the standard salad, the layers are refried beans, rice, much chicken, fresh veggies, limes on the side.  I had to take my daughter to speak the language.  The bar is awesome, the servings are great."}
{"text":"My new favorite Mexican restaurant!!!! They immediately brought out free chips, salsa, AND QUESO as soon as we sat down and they even refilled the queso for free when we ran out. The food was amazing, service was fast, employees were friendly, and prices were reasonable. Will absolutely be returning!!!"}
{"text":"Molcajete $32 amazing amount of food 
Excellent quality!  $4.00 extra platter of chicken, server forgot. 3 Modelo's $51.00 w tax
Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Pros: The tacos were good, and they brought cheese sauce with the chips and salsa. Cons: the mole was the worst I've ever had. It took forever to get our food. They never came back for refills, and when we were clearly ready to leave, we had to wait a good 20 minutes for our check. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Though \"taco\" is not exactly a traditional Spanish (or even Mexican) word, the phrase \"El Taco Veloz\" appears to be designed to indicate \"The Speedy Taco\", if the cartoonish character on the door is any indication.  Unfortunately, speedy is not really a part of the vocabulary here.  Luckily, the staff is friendly, it would just be nice if you saw more of them - for anything.  More chips (any chips, in fact), more drinks, silverware, your check, just about any service at all at times.  The server we had did speak very good English, which was nice.

Like Laura G. - and in fact, at her suggestion - we had a restaurant.com coupon, so we ordered like we had been on a desert island, since the prices were so cheap.  We in fact have a refrigerator full of leftovers, there was so much (and we picked up a cheese dip, drinks and dessert and still were not sure we would meet the required threshold to trigger our coupon).

Aside from the prices, the food is actually quite tasty.  No bland Americanized food here - the only problem we ran into is that much of the meat was overcooked.  In fact, much of the food was overcooked - even the churros were chewy.  Good flavor, just could have been taken off a bit earlier is all.  And the pupusas were excellent, if you are looking for another place that serves them.

Sweet Tea Report: Actually quite decent.  The only downfall here was getting more of it, as mentioned.  An interesting \"twist\" was that it was served with a slice of lime.  I can't recall having seen that anywhere before.  I do not know that I would request it again, but it was not bad."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican.  Great fresh food at amazing prices.  Ordered the salad with chicken.  It was accompanied by avocado, tomatoes, lettuce, cucumbers, pickled jalapeños, turnips, lime and serious hot sauce.  The beef nachos were fantastic.  The beef was seasoned and cooked to perfection.  It is a great place to grab a bite if you're a local or for those passing through IKEA and the surrounding area."}
{"text":"This is probably the best authentic Mexican in Charlotte. The tacos are great and prices are even better. Hubby and I travel from NW Charlotte to eat here often."}
{"text":"Awesome, authentic Mexican cuisine.  Great service and $1 beers, what could be better."}
{"text":"Food was good but....... Service was horrible!! We received 1 basket of chips and then finally on the third time asking for more she told us they were out of chips. How do you run out of chips?!  And she let us order guacamole knowing there was no chips. Then it took 20 mins to get our check once we asked and we had to yell at her again. We are still waiting here another ten mins later wait for her to run out cards. Worse service I've ever had!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love mexican food and this place is really good.  I had their tacos and ceviche tostada.  It was delicious.  It comes with chips salsa and queso."}
