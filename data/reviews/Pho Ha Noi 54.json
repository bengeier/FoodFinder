{"text":"I don't know why the rate is so high! The food is bad. I ordered milk tea! It taste sooooo sweet and taste like medicine! At the end, I asked for the bills for many times, but all the servers just chatting in  the kitchen!"}
{"text":"Amazing food ! Really love the chicken pho here and the fried rice is so good. The service is amazing here, the owner will customize your order to perfection!

Friendly service and really homely Vietnamese food. Come here regularly and have always had a excellent experience !

It's a bonus because they open till 4 am! Great for late night meals. 

Can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"Great flavourful broth. We tried the seafood and the rare beef with brisket. Portion size was decent and included a generous portion of sprouts and mint. Could have used a little more seafood, the beef was good. It was pretty quiet on a Saturday afternoon. Service was quick and friendly. Price was average. We enjoyed it and would come again."}
{"text":"Great food and great customer service. I've only ever ordered delivery and haven't had the time to go into the restaurant but just from the experience of the delivery person down to the person that took my order, they were absolutely polite. The food was soooo good too! Affordable and tasty!"}
{"text":"Basically the only Pho place I go to every time I want food delivered or I'm nearby the area. Broth and noodles are all on point, and meat and other ingredients given are very generous unlike some other Pho places. Their extra large basically feeds 2 people! Parking is a tad difficult though since it's located right along Hurontario and in between King street and Dundas which is a huge and busy intersection within Mississauga. Overall a hidden gem for among existing Pho restaurants."}
{"text":"Love the beef pho with tom yum soup base!! The portion size has always been generous and flavorful as always!! Have to say it's THE best pho in Sauga!!!! And trust me, I have tried a ton of different pho places around Mississauga!

We have also tried a wide assortment of dishes other than pho. Their curries are decent, same with their pad thai. Their fried rice is pretty good too. The chicken and pork rice dishes I found to be seasoned pretty well but meat to rice ratio ain't that great. Oh and their Singapore noodles are tasty and done right with thin vermicelli noodles! 

Friendly service and food is always fresh! Been my personal favorite for quite a number of years now (even before their name change - same restaurant, different owners) - fair prices, great portions, delicious and flavorful!"}
{"text":"Excellent pho.
Open LATE, 4am during the week.
Friendly staff, owner.
Glad I found this place!
Vegetarian Spring rolls also good.
Bathroom had no paper towels and no soap, only downside..."}
{"text":"Very disappointed!! No flavor! 
Veg spring rolls were like mush. 
The chicken and broccoli had no sauce whatsoever and didn't even come with soy sauce it was white pcs of chicken and plain broccoli again, without flavor! 
Chow mein Noodles were just okay. 
Will not order from here again."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time tonight. I like how they close late otherwise I probably would've for McDonald's. 

I got wonton soup which I enjoyed but I feel could've had a little more flavour. 
My boyfriend got bun bo hue. He said it was okay, could've been better. 
I enjoyed the fresh rolls we got. Service could've been a little. Usually when you go to a Vietnamese restaurant the first thing they do is serve you tea which we did not here. 

Will probably come again but not as a
go to pho place. Probably if we're hungry again late night for comfort food."}
{"text":"Always superb service. Amazing food. Looks like they just renovated it. Not sure if management changed but the food is good as always."}
{"text":"My favourite Pho spot in the area!! The place is clean and the service is quick! I always come here to study and eat or come along with a big group there is always space! The broth for the soup is incredibly flavourful, the meat tastes nice and I love how much garnish they give you and the staff is extremely friendly! Even their other food options like the Pad Thai, Fried Rice and fried chicken wings are very good !! I highly recommend this place is you are trying Pho for the first time!!"}
{"text":"Excellent pho broth and fast service. 
We were the only ones in the restaurant so the server took some liberties with how much Katy Perry he played. Basically, it was non stop."}
