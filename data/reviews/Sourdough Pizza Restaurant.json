{"text":"Great pizza   We have enjoyed this place for quite a few years.   Ingredients are above average.   Love the fresh garlic topping

Tough to beat for quality pizza on the East side"}
{"text":"Great local place to eat!  Happened to stay in the Mesa area for a few months and we ate here several times. Everything we tried was good, hubby liked their thin crust pizza and daughter enjoyed their spaghetti with marinara sauce and meatballs. The service was always nice and timely.

There were always lots of customers, seemed to have regulars who were there weekly. We'll return when in the area."}
{"text":"It was a Friday afternoon when my family and I went to this pizza place.  It was my husband and two small kids, both under 3.  Walking in, there was someone to greet and seat us immediately. I had a couple quick glances to see what we stumbled into.  Pretty standard restaurant, booths and tables spread across an open layout.  We were the only customers except an old woman reading the paper off in a corner.  With no other customers waiting, we got drinks and a highchair right away.  

 The menu is simple but still offers a reasonable variety for a pizza place.  The salads, sandwiches and appetizer sections had enough options to take up a page.  The other page was the pizza selections, this was full of specialty pizzas along with various sizes.  I was going to ask for a kids menu after seeing that we only got two menus but it caught my eye on the bottom.  I had also noticed they offer gluten-free food, that doesn't affect me, but it's something worth mentioning. We ordered an appetizer of garlic bread with cheese.  

 Within 5 minutes it was served to the table piping hot.  During that short time I was looking around at the horrible decoration.  There was no set theme, instead just random paintings and small yard sale like trinkets floating around.  There was a bar, but it was not being used they had tables pushed up next to it so no one could sit at the bar.  There was a full bar, and a bar menu on the table.  Next to the bar menu was the lunch specials we were not told about.  We ordered 2 out 3 things that we could've gotten cheaper off the lunch menu, I guess next time we'll know.  
 
 The main dish, of course, was a pizza- a very simple pepperoni pizza.  It looked good and it was a nice size.  Again the pizza was steamy and fresh out of the oven, the polite server also warned us about the kids corn dog being very hot and setting it away from little hands.  The pizza itself had just enough cheese without being to cheesy or greasy.  I myself don't like a lot of sauce, in most cases it's because I don't like the flavor.  Their sauce was slightly sweet, contrasting perfectly with that sourdough crust.  

 We all sat quietly consuming the food until we couldn't eat anymore.  The server handed us a take-out box for what was left.  She then gave us the check and ran our card in a friendly manner.  Overall the experience was really good, nothing spectacular but worth trying.  For the price you pay, if you live close it would be definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I always wanted to try this place, as I like sourdough and had rolled by a few times when I didn't have time to stop.

Anyway, it's not bad. The pizza itself was kind of disappointing as it didn't seem to have that hearty, \"slight mayonnaisey\" taste I attribute to sourdough, but it wasn't terrible or anything.

I really liked the atmosphere, here. My wife was less-than-enthused as it was kind of old in the interior, but it reminded me of places from my childhood (the 80s *cough*) and the people working inside were all very homey and welcoming. Definitely had a small business vibe where everyone knew each other and in fact many old customers came in and were greeted by staff with big \"How have you been?\"s and hugs and stuff. Don't see a lot of that, especially being in the BIG CITY.

The only other thing I want to comment on is the wait time. It seemed pretty long for our pizza. When we got in, we were the only folks who didn't already have our food on the table. We ordered promptly, but it still took about 30 minutes to get the pizza. As it wasn't a super-thick crust pizza (though it was their thickest that we chose), it didn't really make sense...but oh well, nice place anyhow."}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza for myself to go. I ordered a small 10\" with pepperoni and jalepenos. I ordered a 5 and might try the 4 next time. There jalepenos are pretty spicy. The dough was different and didn't weigh me down. I liked the sauce too. I will eat there again. The women that helped me may have been the owner- she was also friendly."}
{"text":"Great place in an over looked area.  Family run with friendly staff.  Love the pizza!  Eaten here for years and never disappointed."}
{"text":"So my experience never happened as the team at Sourdough Pizza apparently did not need our business. The restaurant was dead as as my party of 18 sat down the manager quickly came to our table and said we cannot accommodate us. She very rudely told us we had to sit in separate seating orders by family so their servers could understand it. Never had this happen before. If she could not handle our party she should of politely apologized and we could have moved seats, but apparently they did not need the business. We went to Red Robin where they sat us and had no issue. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"We have ate here before, but tonite's was the last time.  They were somewhat busy, but it was like we were invisible when we came in.  Took 10 minutes to be acknowledged and seated.  Another 10 minutes for the server to come to the table for our drink order.  Throughout the entire meal had to remind her repeatedly of things we asked for.  We had a 2 year old with us and guess who was served last?  Uncalled for!  We did not leave much of a tip because of the terrible service and to top it off after we left for the car, the manager chased behind us asking if there was a problem!  She got told everything that was wrong - why wasn't she checking while we were there?  We have never had such bad service and to be chased to your car made it even worse!"}
{"text":"Food is good, especially the pizza.  However, we experienced a very unpleasant experience on a visit there a few days ago.  Some friends of ours wanted to take us out for lunch so we suggested Sourdough Pizza.  As our friends were paying, we did not know what the total of the check was.  We offered to leave the tip and they insisted it was taken care of.  The server did a decent job.....not great, not bad.  She did not check back to see if we needed drink refills but other than that I did not have any complaints.  Our friends obviously must have left a small tip.  However, knowing them, I know it was not because of them trying to give a message that the service was bad. They are simply ignorant about the suggested 15% to 20% tip.  What happened next was simply shocking.  We were chased out to the parking lot and confronted by the server.  She asked us if we had a problem with the service.  When we truthfully said no, she said with a very nasty edge to her voice \" Well, thank you for showing your appreciation for my services\".  After she left we talked about what happened.  When our friend told us what she left for a tip my husband and I realized that the tip was about half of what we would have left....however that is NO EXCUSE for how we were confronted. I was going to go back in and leave additional money but after I thought about the way it was handled, I decided against it.  Reminder...a tip is not automatic.   I would like to mention that most of the servers there are great, especially Lynelle.  The older woman manager is somewhat rude at times.  It is a shame this was allowed to happen because their food is great. I can see from previous reviews that we are not the only ones that have been treated in the manner.  When we left a 35% tip no one chased us out to thank us so I don't expect to be treated like that either even if the tip was small.   I don't know if I'll be back."}
{"text":"Jeff F.  I have ordered pizza in the past for take home and although average at best we like linguica on our pizza and they are one of the few to offer it. The one tonight was probably  the worst pizza I have ever tasted as we couldn't  even get a slice down. It was dry,tasteless and had very little linguica  and mushrooms  and the tomato sauce was almost nonexistent. I called the restaurant and explained the bad pizza to a woman who said she was only a hostess  and would get the owner or manager for me to talk to. The woman manager who got on the phone was rude and didn't  care at all about the garbage they had sold me. I asked her if she could give me a coupon or a credit  and she refused. I will never buy anything from this restaurant  again."}
{"text":"If you're looking a pizza with a nice crust and toppings of your choosing, try this place.  This pizza is so good when we drive to Phoenix to see MIL we call ahead pick up the pizza and take it with us out to Apache Junction.  Service is good and the beer is cold, with a decent selection.  when you visit tell the girl with the dark hair, the one who has relatives in San Diego, Hi for us.  She is wonderful!"}
{"text":"The BEST pizza! have been going here my whole life with my family! the pizza titus with jalapenos is amazzzzing! We love lynell to be our server she is amazing and feels like part of the family!"}
{"text":"We're Midwest snowbirds and are always looking for the best restaurants when we come to AZ. We found Sourdough Pizza several years ago and have been enjoying it each year since. This sounds crazy, but the first item we ordered from the menu was what they had named \"pizzatitus\". Each pizza selection was named, however, sometime back they changed all the names to numbers. So now it's #11. The rest of the story is: that's the only thing we've ever eaten there. Everyone raves about various pizzas, pastas and other Italian dishes, but we can't seem to stray from our favorite pizza! Great food and service, plus it's always clean and decorated neatly for each season."}
{"text":"Hands-down my favorite pizza place in the East Valley.  I have been going to Sourdough pizza for close to 15 years, and it is consistently delicious.  I grew up in Mesa, now live in Phoenix, but I make it a point to visit Sourdough Pizza when I am in the Mesa area.  The decor definitely leaves something to be desired, as they are in a stucco strip mall, and their interior probably has not been updated  all that much in the 15 years I've been there.  But I could care less when the food and prices are this good."}
{"text":"Best wings ever!! Great pizza and lasagna.  We go here often. Love the quaint atmosphere and super service"}
{"text":"Wonderful little pizza place tucked away in a deserted strip mall, but such hardly takes away from the friendly service and unexpectedly delicious pizza! Sourdough pizza never tasted so good! Warm, welcoming service from greeting to check. Decor is kitschy, but the food compensates."}
{"text":"I am so glad we found this pizza joint! (And I don't mean \"joint\" in a bad way at all!!) The pizza is amazing and the service is better. Friendlier people you will not find!! If you want a nice, quiet place to enjoy a great pizza and be served by smiling people that genuinely appreciate you stopping by, this place is for you!! We always order the biggest pizza they have and take some home. The beer is very reasonably priced too!!"}
{"text":"I consider Sourdough the best pizza joints on the East Side. The crust is moderately thin and crispy, but not dry. The toppings are very fresh and flavorful. The sausage is seasoned well, sometimes crumbly, never rubbery. Order the Titus...it's been our favorite for at least 5 years. Not that we're stuck in a rut or anything.

If you eat in, expect a pleasantly basic place in a sleeply strip mall. We don't mind it there, but usually do take-out."}
{"text":"Yay for Sourdough!  This is East Mesa folks, not exactly a culinary destination.  But this is good pizza!  It's local and been around forever, so it's not exactly trendy.  Please don't take your first date here unless you are an octogenarian on a day pass from the assisted living facility.
No thin crust to be found on this menu.  But pile whatever toppings you can fit on the pizza and enjoy a hearty slice.  They have a decent drink selection, and lots of other italian items on the menu that I've never tried because the pizza is so good.  It's a popular destination for the winter snowbirds, if you go a little later in the evenings, you can avoid the rush.  But three generations of my family have loved this place and the next time you are crusin' Apache Junction, you should check it out!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!  I agree with the other reviews, best pizza in Mesa, for sure!  My friend recommended this place to me, I didn't even know it existed, its in an odd area, in a strip mall on Main Street between Sossoman and Power Rds, next to antique malls, amongst various businesses.  

OK, to the pizza!  Its on a sourdough crust, such a good mixture for crusts.  I had the number 17-I forget the name they gave it, but is the ham with choice of pineapple or mushrooms-I chose mushrooms.  The best part, for me, the toppings are on the crust, under a yummy goey layer of delicious cheeses!  This is how they roll!  

My friend had their \"blanca\" pizza, the best all white pizza I've tasted, and I loved hers more than mine, it is sin on pizza, and I loved it! She chose to have pepperoni, and extra cheese, so amazing to bit into the cheeses with the snap of pepperoni!  I was in pizza heaven.

I want to make a special note, they do serve drinks, amazing prices, but the wine, I DO NOT suggest.  I ordered a red wine, it came, it felt warm in the glass, and one sip sent me to instant nausea.  I had to send it back, telling them it was undrinkable, I ordered a white wine, but even that wasn't the best.  So, this is the reason for the 4 stars, sadly, but 4 is not bad, it has to be on all levels for me to give it a 5.  If they are going to offer adult beverages, I'd like to not have to send back.  But the pizza is a 5 for me! Buon appetito!"}
{"text":"Nice place to eat. The food is great and the atmosphere welcoming. The staff is excellent and attentive, but not too much so. Good value for your money. A very comfortable place to eat."}
{"text":"The service here was top notch. Only three stars because the pizza was not as good as what the other reviewers made it out to be. Seems like this might be a good place to take a large group"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza!!! This is the absolute best pizza I have ever had. I always get the #15 with a 4 scale of heat, thin crust. My wife and I get the extra large as the leftovers are as good as the fresh. We never have leftovers"}
{"text":"So I got back from Italy and missed American-Style Pizza.
The cheesy, saucy deliciousness of our pizza is unparalleled and although I had some darn good pizza abroad, I really did miss our version of this open-pie masterpiece.

Sourdough Pizza is a great little place, doesn't get too incredibly busy during the day so if you want to avoid the crowds, that is the time to go.

They have a good beer selection and pitchers are available (YUM!) in domestic and imported beer selections.

The pizza, oh man the pizza, their original crust (because they offer thin crust too) was not too thick, was the right consistency, had a great flavor and was super fantastic cold the next day. Tons of options for people that like different meats, cheeses, sauces, crusts etc. and the prices are pretty average.

Large pitcher of imported beer and a medium pizza cost us about $25.

But don't take my word for it, check it out yourself."}
{"text":"Ate here again last Friday with my mother after a concert next door at the Dutton Theater and the pizza and pasta were great.  Love their buttered garlic toast too.  We ordered an XL pizza (1/2 pepperoni & sausage and 1/2 grilled chicken).
 
Everything was excellent and the leftovers were quickly devoured once I arrived home.  I have always had a 5-star meal at this restaurant.  The service was also exceptional.  We will be back again soon."}
{"text":"The service was very slow. 3 out of 4 of us got our meal. The 4th came 20 minutes later after we were all  done. The manager was very rude. You would think they would have compensated the late meal but not a chance. Never going there again.  She glared at us as we left. Wow!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza! Good service!
BUT what impressed me most was that regulars would come in and the waitresses called them by name and knew what they would order. 
An excellent little hole in the wall place!"}
{"text":"Great as usual,,,interesting tidbit to share. 

Owners mentioned they go straight to San Francisco twice a year to buy their 
SOURDOUGH.  Nice,,, A little SAN FRAN, right here in lil ol Mesa.i"}
{"text":"I apologize.   I should not have laughed when my little sister blew into a bowl of pepper and it shot up into her eyes and she ran into the bathroom crying.  At 28 years of age, perhaps I should stop finding fart jokes funny.  I am sorry that I take all the fun flavors out of chex mix bags and leave you with the boring bits.  But most egregious of all, I am sorry that I have lived in Arizona for 10 years and didn't try Sourdough Pizza Restaurant until about two months ago.

I have only ordered take out from here, so perhaps I should not review, but I suppose we'll just have to add this on to the list of regrets.  The Crazy chicken wasn't really crazy, but definitely still satisfying combination of mozzarella, cheddar, barbeque sauce, chicken, red onions, and mushrooms.  This was a touch sweeter than we would've liked but the chicken stood out.

The Pizza Blanco was a simply olive oil, ricotta, mozzarella, garlic and choice of two toppings, which we decided to be bell pepper and onion.  This was an outstanding pie with each bite being a perfect proportion of cheese, topping, and dough.  Speaking of which the sourdough was an excellent foil for both pizzas, absorbing the flavors well and getting to that savory, slightly fatty satisfaction in the interior but not greasy in the least on the exterior.

Obviously, I have a lot to apologize- however, I promise that you won't have anything to be sorry about by trying out Sourdough Pizza Restaurant.  Go now!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and her family rave about this place. It is good, but I personally don't think it is mind-blowing (not sure what mind-blowing pizza would be for me). With that said, the place does have good reviews and it is in a hole in the wall. Seriously, if they didn't know about this place I would have never found it. In fact, even if i GPSed the location I wouldn't have found it. It's just not a prominent place at all. In any case, it was good pizza and I would go again!"}
{"text":"Good food but terrible service. We've visited this restaurant three times this winter and each time it's the same lousy service and (last night) a very unhelpful waitress. Maybe we've just had bad luck at this place because so many people speak positively about both the food and service. Go figure."}
{"text":"This is our favorite go-to place to get our pizza fix.  We've never had a bad experience and the servers are always friendly. I am currently enjoying my leftovers for breakfast. Lol! 
The only disappointment is that they're now closed on Sundays. Can't tell you how many times as we're leaving church we say: \"I wish Sourdough was open; that sounds so good right now.\" But I'm glad the employees are able to enjoy the day off."}
{"text":"I have just ordered from sourdough for my very time time and CANNOT BELIEVE the horribly rude customer service I received when I called about our order having some problems. I never asked for anything yet was told the owner \"made it himself\" so he didn't believe my \"story\" is what he said to me. My MIL has ordered from there almost once a week for years and raved about it so long we decided to try it tonight while she's here visiting. It was her who asked me to call because her spaghetti had maybe 1/4 of a cup of sauce on it and was so dry the noodles weren't even pink. The 1st time i called was to ask if that was normal and the manager(girl who never named herself) told me that most people who order cheese on top of spaghetti get extra sauce so I said ok we would remember that for next time. Then my husband and I both open our sandwiches and I ordered extra cheese on my Philly cheese steak and cheese on his meatball sandwich. There was NO cheese on his and so little on mine it couldn't have been more than a teaspoon of it. I called back and the manager gave the phone to the owner. Im guessing so he could tell me it was MY fault LOL. He even asked me \"Do you know who made that sandwich? It was me and im the owner so now im really doubting your\"story\"\"
I have worked in the food industry for 17 yrs and never once have I encountered ANY owner or manager who would rather CONFRONT their paying customers than OFFER a solution. I would have happily brought back the food and had it remade but instead he wanted to blame ME and act like I was lying. You need to take some customer service classes!!!! You are ridiculously horrible and based on your shitty reviews I read before making my own you will be out if business very soon. 
The manager told me There were some new guys in the kitchen tonight BUT the guy who's been there the longest made our food so sorry. What?? Lol don't even offer for us to come back and pick up a cup of extra sauce or let me remake that for you? What in the world is wrong with you guys??? They must be TRYING to lose all their business. Seriously. I do marketing 4 times a week and since I live and work 0.42 miles from your restaurant I am going to make sure everyone knows the kind of customer service we received tonight. Spent over 40 dollars on 2 spaghettis and 2 sandwiches and barely ate half of it. Here's some pictures so the rude PIG of an owner can see my \"STORY \" Was very true....."}
{"text":"The pizza is great, the owner is rude. Do we go back? Spending our money to be treated with disrespect is enough to wish them out of business.
The place is 1/2 darkened to save light as there's no customers. When the old folks die off, who will they have? 
I say, the attitude there sucks and this could be why they have little business. So if you want some great pizza, get it while you can because when the old timers go, so will they.
Place was clean."}
{"text":"Sourdough pizza. The name says all you need to know.  The crust is amazing and the toppings are delicious, too.  Our favorite is the #9 with meatballs and hot tomatoes.  Their homemade salad dressings are fantastic--I love the blue cheese my family loves the ranch. 

It can get busy but once you're seated everything comes out quickly.  Worth the wait.  Staff is friendly and the restaurant is clean.  Our favorite pizza in the east valley."}
{"text":"We just tried a pizza from here today after getting good feedback from forums, friends and social media contacts.  As a home bread baker, I love sourdough breads and couldn't wait to try this crust.  The crust was very good.  Nice and thin.  The toppings were great, especially with diced jalapenos baked on.  

The only problem I had with this pizza was the mozzarella.  It is creamy (similar to warmed up brie), as opposed to chewy and stretchy that you would get from bocconcini and better quality mozzarella.  You typically find the creamy consistency in mozzarella if you buy the cheap, no-name mozzarella from the grocery store.  This creamy kind of mozzarella is a game breaker for me unfortunately.  Which is disappointing because as a frequent visitor to Mesa, I would love to have a local go-to pizza place, closer than Phoenix's Pizza Bianco (which is spectacular).

For my sake, I hope this place changes the quality of cheese...everything else is top notch."}
{"text":"Sticking with my New Year's resolution to lose a few pounds,  I have started walking my dog about 3-4 miles every morning. With the temp slowly creeping up I tend to go out early as possible.  With not much going on that early in the morning you tend to notice things. This was one. After passing by this place a few times I decided to do a little investigating. 

OK so let me get a few things out the way. The area is not bad as others have said (there is a high school next door so how bad can it be?). It is in a strip mall so the restaurant is not very big. They have been in business at the same location for over 20 years. Also a word of warning the place does get packed by the early bird crowd around 4pm so come early or after 6pm if you want a good table. Also while the place is not what I would call fancy you can tell that they have actually put some thought into how the place was decorated. 

Nice solid wood tables are set up family style with little booths in the back, a perfect place for teens and the young at heart to grab a slice with their sweet heart. They even went so far as to put a table in front of the open kitchen so you can watch as they create your meal from scratch. Their claim to fame is the pizza they offer. One look at the menu and you see the usual cast of characters. But what stood out to me was they offer wheat and gluten free products for those looking for a few options. Their pizza sizes are kind of unusual as they start with a 8 inch mini and go up to a 16 inch extra large. The sauce was light and nice tasting and the crust lived up to the sourdough claim as well. Not over powering but the flavor was a nice change up from the usual chain offerings. Not in the mood for pizza (what is wrong with you?) they also offer pasta, deserts, sandwiches, soups and salads. This is one great little neighborhood place! And I for one am glad to be it's neighbor (Mr. Rodgers music plays) LOL."}
{"text":"Came here today as my husband was craving pizza. I am a sourdough lover so I was very excited to try this place out.  Located in a scary abandoned mall  we had no trouble finding parking.  The place was dark and not too welcoming but the smell was inviting so we thought we'd go ahead and give it a try.  Wanted to order the garlic bread was disappointed to find it was made with French bread not sourdough  ordered a mini pizza it was good but nothing I have to come back for. My husband ordered the 3 mini sourdough he enjoyed them but we both agreed no need to come back here. Especially when Oregano's and Sauce have amazing pizzas and are closer to us. Server was very friendly."}
{"text":"Honestly, this is some of the best pizza in Mesa/Arizona/Southwest US. Their pizza is never greasy and it always taste fresh. It's even great the next day. My favorite is sausage and jalapeño. I can't say enough good things about Sourdough Pizza."}
{"text":"Nice little place with really good pizza and comfortable booths (tables are a little rickety).  Now I want to try all the pizza choices, guess we have to keep going back."}
{"text":"This place is \"ok\". I'm in town from California visiting my brother here in Mesa and we wanted some pizza and pasta. After reading the reviews we decided to give this place a try. We ordered an extra large BBQ pizza (#7) and half of it was the #13 (veggie style).  I also ordered the cheese stuffed ravioli with the meat sauce.  Everything we ordered was Ok.  I definitely would go to Pizza Hut over this place on any other occasion.  It's a cute restaurant inside with a great home style feel but the food just lacks flavor and home made quality.  I was hoping the quality would reflect from the 4 star rating.  I'm giving this place a 3 because it wasn't terrible. But it also wasn't anything special.  If you really want Italian style pizza, I'd look somewhere else first."}
{"text":"If I ever find myself walking down this street again for those outdoor events they have in downtown Mesa I will be back to this location. Love the pizza for the price that you pay."}
{"text":"Love their hand tossed crust and appreciate they have a decent option for gluten free pizza. Salads and cheese bread are also very good."}
{"text":"Today I ordered a meatball sandwich with cheese.  There was no cheese on the sandwich and the flavor was just average.  The menu seemed a bit over priced."}
{"text":"Been going here for over 25  years...awesome food, great people, amazing service.   Brought many other families here who are continued customers too"}
{"text":"We have been coming to Sourdough Pizza for 11 years. I've brought them lots of business and have introduced lots of our friends and family to this restaurant. Tonight we came here for a nice family dinner. Everything was great Up until my husband was eating his second piece of pizza and had pulled a long grey hair out of his mouth. It was so disgusting!!! All of us had lost our appetite!!! Our server saw my husband pull the hair out of his mouth, was great about the situation, but he had talked to the person in charge, and the people in the back, and No one took responsibility, and they were more mad at us, than accepting responsibility. The server tried to make it right by remaking the pizza or take the charge off, but management would not let him remake the pizza or remove the charges for the item. Needless to say, we'll be giving sourdough a break for a while and choose elsewhere to eat pizza."}
{"text":"One of the worst Philly cheesesteak sandwiches I've ever had. Giant side pieces of onion, no seasoning, no dressing or mayo, no lettuce or tomato, not enough of the poor quality beef to even cover the bread. Don't waste your money on a cook who can't cook."}
{"text":"This is one of the best family owned pizza and spaghetti places around Mesa. Great food and good swrvice!"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, it's good but the way it's built up it's kind of a let down. I've definitely had better pizza. It's a sit down or pick-up only restaurant so no delivery. Thethe decor was kind of cluttered and dated and the staff seemed too flustered to be nice. Food hit the table quickly and again it was decent...but just that.

I mean, it's good but I wouldn't go out of my way for it."}
{"text":"Great pizza place. Good pizza, nice staff. We really the crispy crust. One of our favorite Sunday evening places to eat!"}
{"text":"We have been here three times, twice for our little date nights, once with or kids, and we have never had a bad experience. We are always treated like family when we walk in, everyone is so friendly. On Monday nights they have special pricing for pizzas, and we take advantage of that. Pizzas are off the charts good!!! We have found our little hidden Jem!"}
{"text":"This place is sure hard to find, but the pizza is surly worth the visit. The restaurant is tucked in the very empty old strip mall and the actual place is in the corner. They have been there over 25 years and the interior is pretty outdated. We had great service, but could of been we were the first customers there for lunch. The staff told us they are very busy during winter the snowbirds, but summers are much slower.

If it's your first visit the regular crust is a must to try. Sourdough pizza crust is delicious!!"}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal from here. My family is from NY so growing up their high standards for pizza have rubbed off on me and so there is very few pizzas that I'm absolutely happy with. Sourdough Pizza is my number one. Not only is the food delicious but the people there are so nice. I drive out of my way for this place."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant tonight and really enjoyed it. We sat outside (there is one table outside) because it was quite crowded. Even though we were the only family seated outside, we had great service. They did not forget about us, and brought our pizzas out piping hot. The sourdough crust is even better than I expected.  Not overpowering at all, and the texture of the crust was one of the best I ever had. We will be back for sure, and hopefully soon."}
{"text":"Tried it on a whim Saturday (5/12/2012) night. Pretty much blew my mind. I had the pizza blanco with sausage & pepperoni. Picked it up and took it home. AMAZING. The crust is fantastic & the favors are just right. The only negative was the cashier, she was kinda awkward, but whatever. 

I don't really give 5 stars but this place deserved it, highly recommend this place, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Waitstaff was very welcoming and friendly! Pizza was amazing, and the crowd was laid back! Will definitely be going back in the future."}
{"text":"If you were looking for delicious pizza with a special taste, look no further!  I love this restaurant for many reasons, but it's their Sourdough Pizza that keeps me coming back!  The owner makes two trips a year to personally pick up the  sourdough in San Francisco.  The unique taste is absolutely the best I have ever had!  You definitely want to check out their lunch specials, including personal pizzas and a drink for a very reasonable price.  The menu includes a number of other selections besides their signature pizza.  Their grilled chicken salad is another favorite of mine.  The friendly servers make you feel valued and appreciated!  It is a family own restaurant and that adds to its appealing ambiance.  So what are you waiting for?!!  Head over to Sourdough Pizza to enjoy an incredibly delicious pizza today!!  You'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"I would visit family in Arizona back in 1990. And we'd always do a big family dinner here. In 1992, I moved to tempe, and we'd still head out to this place. Then in 1996, after I'd finished up at ASU, I moved back to San Diego. We'd visit and hit up Sourdough now and then. I don't think I've been there since about 1999. We took a chance and we went back again on Monday,  7/21. Ever go to a place and just hope it's the same? Ohmygoodness. It was just as I remembered it all those years ago. I love their Bleu cheese dressing (I know it's an Italian place, don't judge). Their sausage mushroom pizza (#10) is awesome. I love how thin they slice the mushrooms. Their regular crust (I haven't had others) is amazing. My 13 year old had never been there before. She is one who eats the toppings, and leaves the crust. Not here. She pulled the last piece of her mini and ate only the crust. It was so nice to go there and have it be just as great as I remember. Oh...service was great too!"}
{"text":"Tried it, liked it, recommend it! Pizza is very good, Ravioli with meat sauce was also very good!"}
{"text":"Our new favorite pizza in Mesa. We had a half #15, half #19 on thin crust. Delicious. The crust is perfectly chewy, yet slightly crusty on bottom. They put just the right amount of toppings, not too overloaded. 

We called it in and got it to go on a Friday night, but the place was packed inside. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This place has been a staple of East Mesa's culinary offerings for as long as I can remember. Classic service and usually done with a smile. I still love to visit this place whenever I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza. I especially like the thin crust. Friendly staff. My wife and I  really liked the  waitess Danielle. She is friendly, nice to talk to, and an excellent server.  Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"I love this pizza! I was looking to try a different pizza place and saw this on Yelp. It's not too far from my house and I didn't know it was there. It's kind of tucked back in a plaza that I drive by all the time. I called and placed a take out order and they were very friendly on the phone and in person. It's a nice little place and I will be back for a sit down meal. The pizza was incredible and so was the garlic bread. I have found a new favorite that I will go back again and again."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this quaint little place tucked away in the back corner of a deserted strip mall and saw it was busy so we decided to give it a try. So glad we did! The place was very cute inside. The service was great. The food was absolutely delicious!  We are very picky about where we eat, and we both loved this place! It's definitely our new \"go to\" place for pizza/Italian. Very reasonable prices. By far the best Italian we've found so far in the East Valley!!!"}
{"text":"Both my husband and I had pizza cravings, and he had Sourdough Pizza on his bookmark list so we decided to give it a try.
I was impressed! The restaraunt was decked out in Fall/Halloween decor mixed with Italian themed decor. Upon walking into the restaraunt it smelled amazing with the aromas of fresh Italian ingredients. We were greeted and seated with a smile, given menus and ordered our beverages. 
Upon studying the menu of Italian goodness, I decided on the three little sourdoughs. They take 3 pieces of amazingily crispy garlic bread, top one with salami, one with pepperoni and the other with Italian sausage, they are then smothered with mozerella cheese and baked to a crispy crunchy OMG mouthwatering goodness.
I didn't think I'd be able to eat all three in one sitting, but after the first bite I was hooked. Yum!
The prices are reasonable, the staff is friendly, and the restaraunt is clean and bright. My husband and I will defitnely be back to Sourdough pizza when our next pizza craving hits!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight with my husband. We ordered the #19 which has sausage & pep, we asked for it well done & regular crust.  It came out pipping hot and we thought it was a great pizza! Service was good but I wish the drink menu stated that they had Blue Moon on tap (didn't want Bud Light or Miller Lite). I found out when the waiter brought the table next to us one. I will save that information for our next visit!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It is fairly priced and absolutely delicious. I have been a loyal customer for over 10 years and will continue. I do wish they would open the other side of the restaurant up again though...."}
{"text":"This place has been in business since 1989, and the decor is nostalgic for those missing the bygone era of the early nineties. No shortage of oak veneer and brass. Ah, the good old days!

This was our first visit, and rather than go for the obvious, we both ordered the lasagna. Our server recommended adding the mozzarella cheese to the garlic bread, and we thought, why not? After all, we're not lactose intolerant, so bring on the cheese, we can take it!

The lasagna has sliced meatballs and mushrooms between layers of pasta and cheese, and was served piping hot after a wait that seemed long but was quickly forgotten after one bite of the delicious gooey layers. The marinara sauce was fine, not sweet but not acidic either. Nicely balanced and definitely not pizza sauce, so no cheating here. 

The garlicky mozzarella bread was a treat, although I was initially disappointed that it was not made with sourdough bread. That was nearly made up for because it's made with that nice soft French bread like you get from Albertsons, and I mean that as a compliment. Nothing French about it but it's lovely and was certainly nicely cheesed and garlicked. 

One soda was ordered, no refill was offered but that's not the end of the world. The server was sweet and otherwise attentive. 

Be aware, they close rather early during the week, started cleaning up at 7:30.  Pizza is discounted on Monday nights, 

$27.98 including tax for two. 

Will definitely return. Apparently Monday night special is a discount on the pizza, so that's a good excuse to go back."}
{"text":"Food was good but the servers need to learn how to be proper servers there was two in particular on the young end and that badmouth other customers where you can hear him nice atmosphere good food but just don't ask for a booth they don't like you to choose where you want to set"}
{"text":"My favorite go-to place for wings!!!!!!! It's not on their menu online but man it's worth trying!! There's no different choices for what kind of wings you want - they are seasoned perfectly! On top of the wings, their pizzas are delicious!!! I've never been disappointed whenever my kiddos and I order or dine-in here! Plus the staff is awesome and super friendly! Biggest plus for me, they are right around the corner ! Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"This place has been here since the school was a movie theater! Hand tossed crusts, fresh toppings - oh and good margaritas! Order by the numbers, but we recommend the #9, the Blanco (white) pizza. All the taste and no acid kick-back! Cute little place, very frequented by the older crowd - especially snow-bird season!  They don't deliver but you can order for pick-up."}
{"text":"Best. Pizza. In. Mesa. HA! Not saying much I know. It has been YEARS since we've eaten at Sourdough Pizza but boy was it GOOD. 
We lived in Chandler and don't remember how we heard about this place but boy am I glad we did. 
It is as far out in Mesa as you can get I am pretty sure.  Once my folks were visiting and we were taking them there for some yummy za.  My dad asked if we were going to Utah for pizza? FAR! 
We ordered the Fireman's pizza. Pepperoni with Jalapenos. Holy GOODNESS!  You can order it on a scale of 1-10. We usually ended up at about a 4 or 5 I think.  
Seriously delicious crust too. 
YAY SDP!"}
{"text":"Mrs. has celiac so we went here. Very good gluten free pizza. Regular pizza good also wings were very good as well. Service was excellent. Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Overall good food. Prices decent. Moderate to bad service. Took more than 30 min to get one pizza. Only three other tables after the Saturday lunch crowd.

Servers forgetful! not good in the least about special requests. We had three easy ones, none were met.

Hostess is one of the worst customer service people I've ever encountered. She barely speaks or acknowledges the customer, sometimes doesn't speak at all.

No wi-fi, no email on website. Really catchup to modern times.

Undecided if we will return.. We were in a rush today, disappointed that we were waiting so long, getting concerned about time.

Too bad owners don't have email, would have written them directly before this review."}
{"text":"Sourdough is a true hidden gem. I've been coming here since I was a kid and will still make the drive out all the way from Scottsdale when I need a delicious pizza. A lot has changed in the plaza around but sourdough pizza is still as amazing as it was 20 years ago. Love love love!! Nothing compares. I recommend this place to everyone I know. 

Please don't ever go out of business I would be heart broken."}
{"text":"Delicious!!  Defeintely my favorite pizza place!  I have been eating here for the last 20 years!  It is in an odd area, but \"back in the day\" it was next to an AMC Theater, so perfect for dinner and a movie.  They still seem to be going strong though.

They have many pizzas to choose from.  Sourdough crust and fresh ingredients (fresh jalepenos).  The jalepeno and sausage is my favorite and you get choose the hotness to your liking from 1-10.  Owners are very friendly too!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The pizza here was quite good! The name makes it obvious, but it really was a very tasty sourdough crust. My family LOVES sourdough bread so we would have enjoyed an even more sourdough-y flavor but that said, it was unique and they followed through with their name!

That being said, the garlic bread with cheese probably wasn't worth the money- it was pretty standard and nothing special at all.

The atmosphere was very homey- it reminded me of a very small town restaurant in a good way. Mis-matched furniture, etc, gave it some charm that made me feel like I was truly in a mom and pop place (which we love).  

The waitress was kind- I think she was the only one serving that evening but there were just a handful of tables.  The only downside to the service was that they sat each party quite close together- as in 4 tables sat all next to each other in some way.  I realize that helped the waitress out to make it a little easier on her but it was a little awkward to be sitting that close when there was much more space in the restaurant.

Overall, we really enjoyed the pizza and would order again!"}
{"text":"We were seated immediately and brought water and our wine order.  We ordered a medium with Italian sausage, peppers and black olives.  My wife had an order of anchovies on the side.  The sourdough crust was excellent. Everything tasted delicious.  We even brought 2 pieces home with us to warm up the next day.  Our server was Barb and she did a great job of making sure everything was the way we wanted it.  We would highly recommend this establishment to anyone wanting a great pizza.  We did see other people having other Italian dishes not just pizza.

We did arrive early ( 4:15 pm).  When we left an hour later the place was filling up rapidly.  They were coming in groups of six to ten at a time.

We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Good Pep. pizza, polite staff, nice insides, we will be going back!"}
{"text":"The service was good up until we left, we were followed out by a worker and demanded to leave a tip. We had left a tip before we left under a plate to were it wasn't visible until they cleaned the table. It was rude of them to make assumptions and follow us out."}
{"text":"Other restaurants have come and gone but this one has been there like what my wife said about 20 years existing in the area. Congratulations!!! I loved the old recipe sourdough pizza. I enjoyed it very much. Neighbors please help our local business survive. We need them to support our local community."}
{"text":"Worst pizza we ever had. Ordered a half pineapple and half veggie pizza.  You had to use a magniying glass to see pineapple and there was  a scant amount of veggies on pizza and not a   great deal of cheese. The crust was dry and chewy.  When we complained, the management was defiant and obnoxious to us. We were told never to come back, as if that would happen again."}
{"text":"I've been coming here with my family since I was a little kid and it has continued to be my favorite pizza place. Everyone is super nice and the food is amazing"}
{"text":"I'm very suspicious of the reviews that are below 3. I haven't been here with anyone over some twenty years of going that didn't love the pizza. Does it need a facelift? Maybe/ probably. Is the service great? Probably not but it has fantastic food and is very reasonably priced. There is a ton of WT in this area and I wonder how many of ya'll (intentional) were trying to get something free from the jump. This is easily one of the best pizza places in Mesa and to me it's as good as anywhere I've had around the valley. Treat yourself and grab a pizza from here... but unfortunately you can't catch a movie next store at AMC like the good ol days."}
{"text":"At a recent visit to Sourdough Pizza we had a bad experience. It started off with the sad looking and very nasty tasting, non-edible want to be Philly Cheese steak sandwiches. They were frozen steak-um which starts off insulting Philly. The want to be beef was not even chopped up. We decided they needed to be sent back and the waitress then proceeded to be rude from that point forward because of this.  She replied with a smirk, \"You will still have to pay for them.\" That is not good business sense making your customers pay for food they have not even taken a bite of and are unsatisfied with. The waitress darts off and lets the cook know what just happened. He came out acting rude as well and making comments like \"What do you want me to do, cut them up for you?\" During this whole time a manager or owner looked on but did not approach the table to figure out what was going on. Another bad business move to not want to try and resolve unhappy customers. We will certainly not visit this establishment again and advise all our friends, family and clients not visit either."}
{"text":"This was the best Gluten-Free pizza crust I have had in any restaurant. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I went inside today to pick up our pizzas (usually hubby makes the trip) and I have to add...what a nice place!!  Very comfortable, family friendly vibe!  Like a great neighborhood mom/pop restaurant should be. :)  Add the fact that we can get good pizza while our daughter can enjoy a few slices of good gluten free pizza = 5 stars all the way. :)"}
{"text":"Looking for something a little different in the pizza arena? SDP has very good pizza! you can definitely taste the sour dough. good sauce/cheese

Unfortunately, very disappointed in the Philly Cheesesteak sandwich. Mostly mushy bread, with minimal crispiness. Overcooked onions and green peppers to the point of extracting all flavor. Lackluster meat. I guess there were mushrooms on there too.

Stick with the pizzas"}
{"text":"Excellent service. Pizza was out fast and servers were friendly. I've had better meatball sandwiches but overall it was decent. The AC was out on this 108 degree day so that was a huge bummer for our very large party of 30+."}
{"text":"Good pizza. Everyone with me thought so too. Not the best ever, but definitely satisfies a pizza craving. I'm not a big fan of thin crust  and don't like too much crust. Their's was perfect. Price was okay, if I have the money I will definitely go again but if I'm watching my budget I'd rather go to a place that gives me an amazing pizza for that price."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever! I've been going her since I was a kid and it's tastes the same all these years! I would recommend this place to anybody. Pizza is like no other"}
{"text":"I had the Pizza Blanco, and a small salad. Yum! Kids had spaghetti. This place was so delicious, my niece (7 yrs old) was bragging to her Mom that she had the best dinner. Great prices as well. A good drive from south Chandler but I will be back!"}
{"text":"We had the pepperoni/mushroom and the Bianca with sliced tomatoes.  Everything was very good. My wife and I each ordered 10\" pizzas and had enough to take home. Nice restaurant, friendly staff and fun holiday decorations up for Halloween."}
{"text":"I've had Sourdough Pizza Restaurant on my radar for some time. The concept of sourdough pizza crust intrigued me. If you know something about sourdough it is not made like other dough. It takes a lot of time and care to have the sourdough turn out right. This restaurant gets it right. The crust was perfect. Clearly this hand crafted pizza was not thrown together carelessly. The toppings were fresh and evenly distributed. Not too much sauce, but just enough to compliment the cheese and toppings. I had to choose between hand tossed or thin crust. I chose thin, which is my usual preference. The crust was crispy without being crumbly. It was a perfect golden brown. I enjoyed this pizza as well as the atmosphere. I am looking forward to experiencing more items on their menu. 
I would give this place a 5 star, but they do not substitute toppings on their signature pizzas. They remove the one you don't want and charge for the additional one you do want."}
{"text":"Very friendly service. Highly recommend the hand tossed crust. It was airy and crispy. We ordered a meat lovers pizza and my husband was disappointed that the toppings were on the light side. The large pizza had lots of uncovered areas. The sauce was good. We got there just at 5 pm. Not too long afterward the line was out the door. You could tell there were several regulars. Service was friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Only found this place because my son's school orders pizza from here on Wednesdays...but what a find!  Absolutely LOVE their pizza for lunch, and have never been disappointed by their service.  They have a white pizza that with added chicken and sun dried tomatoes is heavenly!  Definitely worth the visit."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious pizza and pizza breads. Visiting from indiana, looking for something different than what we can get at home. Loved it!"}
