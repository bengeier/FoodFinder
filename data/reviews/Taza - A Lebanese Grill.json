{"text":"Super yummy meze, we usually share the taste of Taza and veggie feast so we can try a bit of everything. The pita is made fresh and served warm. Pricy, but worth it!"}
{"text":"I am pretty picky about my Lebanese food after living in Dearborn, Michigan, and I have to say this is the first shawarma I've had that equates to the goodness of Dearborn middle east cuisine (including attempts in Dubai, Boston, London, and various other places).  The meat shawarma pita was delicious, and the baba ganoush was honestly the best I've ever had (granted I'm not a huge baba fan typically).  Appetizer hummus and baba was huge, but I feel like it was reasonably priced for the quality.  Next time I come to the area I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We were taken to Taza in Beachwood the other night and we were looking forward to some great Lebanese food.  Unfortunately, besides finding a mile long hair in my swarma, the food was simply awful.  I don't know what happened since my last visit several years ago but the food has gone down hill considerably.  Located in beautiful Eaton Place, the restaurant is in a prime spot for true foodies to partake but this is one place to pass up.  The service was very good and the waiter was honestly sorry about the hair ball but alas, the food all around was absolutely awful."}
{"text":"I agree with most of the other posters - this place is just an upscale version of Aladdin's.  I expected there to be slightly more variety between the two.  It's possible Taza has different/better entrees, since it's more of a sit-down restaurant, but I've only had mezza items.  And they were pretty solid, but identical to Aladdin's.  So I think I'd rather just go to Aladdin's and pay less.  The space is gorgeous, so I guess I could see it as a good option for a date or something more formal than Aladdin's would provide.  The bread is better here.  It's not pita bread, don't let them fool you, but it was soft and warm and delicious.  Unfortunately I filled up on it waiting for our food.  And since we only ordered mezza items, that's a bit disconcerting.  The service could have been better.  The oil spice mix with the bread was flavorless.  Maybe they read these reviews and cut out salt entirely (which was oddly not provided on the table, I noticed).  A surprise favorite of mine were the sausages in a cherry sauce.  I don't remember what they were called.  Spinach pies also quite good.  Kibbee and grape leaves were a bit mushy, a problem I've also found at Aladdin's.  If they fixed that, I think the flavors are pretty spot on.  All in all, I'll skip Taza for Aladdin's.  But I understand it serves its purpose for the Eton clientele."}
{"text":"The place was fantastic! I was so surprised at how good the food tasted, and also the fantastic service!  Highly recommend anyone in that area to try this place."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Lebanese food and I couldn't have enjoyed the experience more! Our waiter walked me through the menu and set realistic expectations for the dishes. The food was fantastic, will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Good food and service, have been there multiple times. Nice place and ambience. Parking is a hassle though. The pita bread ,zatar oil, falafel are good. The chicken kafta/ tawook are really good. Just a tiny bit expensive though!"}
{"text":"My Favorite- Love so many items on the menu!  Taza Chicken salad is amazing! We get take-out more than we go there.  It is always ready in 15 minutes and they will give you extra pitas for $1!"}
{"text":"I had a long lunch at Taza yesterday and was pleased, but not wowed by the food.  We received complimentary fried kibbeh (which was quite good) and ordered hummus as a starter (also delicious).   Both of us had the shish tawook wrap which was fresh, but just okay in the taste department- not something that I would get again.   The Chocolate Bomb cake which we shared was a very tasty combination of chocolate cake, ganache and a lovely frosting.   The by-the-glass wine list was also excellent.    The service was very attentive.    I'll go again, but will try another entree....."}
{"text":"We've visited Taza twice and really enjoy the food and the atmosphere. The bread basket and oil you munch on while you wait for your entree is delicious in and of itself. On this particular visit, my husband had the combination platter with the beef kabob, chicken kabob and beef kafta. He loved all if it. I went with my usual shish kabob platter which was also delicious. The veggies weren't cooked very evenly though with some pieces very tender and others much more raw & crunchy. I prefer more tender veggies, but that's just a personal preference and not a deal breaker. My only complaint at this visit is that my husband ordered a beer & the waitress came back to tell us they were out of that variety. Not a big deal... but he ordered another and they were out of that one too. He finally ordered one they had in stock on his fourth try. It was a Saturday afternoon and I would have expected a restaurant with a full bar to be decently stocked for weekends, so we were surprised about that. It didn't upset us but just quite strange. Overall, it was yummy and we will visit again!"}
{"text":"Taza is an authentic Lebanese restaurant. The food is carefully prepared and the servers seem sincere. The hummus in various forms (including garlic) is excellent. You can't go wrong ordering the Shawarma, chicken or beef, and the \"Taste of Taza\" gives you a nice medley of lebanese cuisine.   I will rate Taza 5 stars to compensate for others who experienced a \"ratings tug of war\" and 5 fell in the mud to 4."}
{"text":"Flavorful and good. Warm pita and Zatar...so good. Only thing missing was the garlic for the chicken. It could've been missed by the waitress. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Where to start with this place...The best way I can review this place in a as few words as possible: A Mediterranean Applebees for people who's only experience with Middle-Eastern food (or Mediterranean food for that matter) is the pita bread that they make their turkey/bacon/avacado/tuna/spinach/fat free mayo wraps with.   Now here is a more detailed review:  The menu consists of Lebanese recipes and standard Middle-Eastern kebabs...all Americanized and dumbed down for the Amercian palate. That's fine and all (most Chinese, Indian, and even Italian restaurants are the same), but they went over the top. I had Kafta Kebab wrap, however the \"kafta meat\" wasn't even a basic Lebanese kafta. It was spiced the wrong way and made without lamb. Lebanese Kafta is supposed to be a mix of beef and lamb, no chicken. Here, you only have a choice between the cow and the bird. I can't even compare it to other Kafta that I have had or have made myself, because this wasn't even Kafta. It was a meat ball with parsley, oil, and funk.   For a side I got an order of one of my tried and true favorites, Tabouli. I have had Greek, Israeli, Lebanese, Turkish, and Egyptian versions of Tabouli multiple times before, each from multiple different establishments and households. But this one took the cake...the urinal cake. Not to be harsh to the owner or anything, however, tabouli is supposed to have a healthy ratio of bulgur to tomato to parsley to garlic et al. However, this was medley seemingly of only parsley, garlic, and onion, or at least it tasted as such. I honestly felt like I just went to the fresh herb stand at the market, took a bunch of fresh parsley, and shoved it in my mouth all at once. I love parsley, but these proportions were out of countrol.   The only reason this place gets 2 stars is because they make their own bread, the place was very clean and nice looking, and the service was good with the owner personally greeting all of his customers. I respect that. However, even if you are going to make a dumbed down, Americanized version of traditional Lebanese/Middle-Eastern Recipes (again, like they do at most Chinese, Indian, and Italian restaurants), at least make it taste half-good. I enjoyed my Pepsi though, very refreshing."}
{"text":"One of our regular places to eat. When my daughter comes home from school, Taza is always at the top of the list.   You absolutely must eat the bread. Ask for it hot - don't settle for warm. HOT. And dip it in the oil-Zatar blend.  You should order something too, though, tempting as it is to just eat the bread. Literally everything is good. Lebanese Jibneh is a good appetizer to share. The soups, salads, falafels, just everything is yummy."}
{"text":"The food is good but the service is really horrible.  I won't be going back."}
{"text":"This place and their food was amazing! and the server Rawan was so friendly, informative and just amazing! She made our experience very enjoyable!!!  Thanks again Rawan for a great evening and your services!!!!"}
{"text":"This is our first visit to the restaurant. The wether is nice so we sat outdoor. The server is excellent, friendly & quick in responses. The owner himself was taking care of our table & other guests tables. The food was good & sure a place we will come to visit again!"}
{"text":"Holly Mackerel was this place good! I was in town on business and picked up take out for the hotel. I couldn't believe how good this place was. Went back again for a lunch meeting the next day. Hoping my client asks me back so I can eat here again. I'm originally from Cleveland, so forgive the snobbery. I did not expect such authentic Lebanese food in the middle of a Cleveland suburb. Come eat here!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine turned me on to this fantastically delicious restaurant a few years ago and it has still remained one of my favorites!  The atmosphere is great - decorative decor without being TOO gaudy but at the same time also very inviting.  Or if you're in the mood for a more organic environment, the patio is a great place to dine also (and personally my choice of seating).   Once seated you are offered a basket of fresh warm pita bread to nibble on while you try and decided which of the mouth watering options you will order for your meal.   I have sampled something from each of their menu categories and have yet to be disappointed.  I will mention that you better like garlic if you eat here because there are very few menu items that don't include it, so this isn't a great first date option or somewhere to eat if you plan on locking lips with someone later in the evening (just saying).  But if you're looking for a relaxed atmosphere with great service, excellent food, and awesome prices then Taza is totally worthy trying!"}
{"text":"There is nothing that I don't like at this place.  I love the kibbi and the fries are great.  The food is quit authentic.  The service is superb."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  I love the baba here!  True Lebanese Tabouli that is so good.  The warm pita bread is fantastic.  It is a little on the pricey side but the food was worth it to us.  We have never had to wait for a table but I have only been during the week at around 5:30."}
{"text":"I am one of those Americans who loves lebanese olives.  So I asked for some here and got a free plate of this candy.  The meal was pretty good overall, but I think next time I may not get the beef shwarma.  Next time it will will be chicken.   Oh, and the desserts are great here, and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. My wife and my two girls love this place,but for me they over cook my beef. I think the female like this place better. when we came here it is like 3 female to 1 male."}
{"text":"we (party of 2) went to taza for dinner tonight and i have to say that it was one of the most awful dining experience we ever had. first, our server took around 10 minutes to greet us at our table. then it took another 10 minutes for our drinks. granted that our appetizer (falafel) came right after we ordered, our main entree, which consisted of a sampling of salata, shish tawook, chicken and couscous, didn't get to our table until an hour later. service was dismal and very inconsistent. we did come during dinner but the dinner rush was ending so i don't think there was any excuse for the SLOOOOW service we received. in fact, some diners who came in AFTER us got their food first!  the evening probably would've been saved by great food, but alas, the flavor was mediocre at best. i've eaten way better lebanese food at other places and at a more reasonable price. it was our first and last time at taza. so, never again...it was a waste of food, a waste of good money and a waste of time."}
{"text":"Always a great experience at this Taza location.  The manager/owner is waiting to great you with a smile as you enter the restaurant.  Pita is always served up hot with their addictive olive oil/vinegar/zaktar concoction for dipping.  We usually order either an app platter or just order 2-3 apps on our own.  They are all excellent but our favorites are the hummus, foul medames, grape leaves and fries (yes fries, which are always hot, crispy and doused in tasty Lebanese spices).  Service is pretty good most visits but can be slow when they are busy.  Overall, very good Lebanese food and at a very reasonable price.  The only negative, at no fault of Taza, is trying to find a parking spot in the lawless Eaton parking lot!"}
{"text":"We went in the afternoon around 2 pm, and there were hardly any other patrons in the place. The service was abominable, and while we enjoyed the kibbe and the schwarma immensely, the hummus I ordered tasted like a can of chick peas put into the food processor with no salt, pepper, garlic or other seasonings. Bland as could be. I ate only a few bites to sustain my hunger. The server had initially brought us hot pitas we were supposed to dip into a blend of oils and herbs while we waited for our food to arrive, but she never came round to give us the dip. And when our food arrived I asked if I could have some fresh pitas for my hummus and she pointed to the ones that had gotten cold as we had not had anything to eat them with and gave a great attitude about bringing more. My husband had ordered fries and she never brought the ketchup. So they also got cold while he waited. Eventually a busser came by, sweeping the floor and we got him to bring us some ketchup and pitas. Then we sat for an eternity waiting to ask for our check and some boxes. No opportunity for drink refills during our lunch. Eager to get out of there, I went to the restroom and came back and we decided to give it six more minutes. At which point I got up and wandered around to find anyone who was working there to get the job done."}
{"text":"First class experience:  portions are large, service was great. Had the lamb kibbe and the felafel as appetizers. Did I mention the fresh pitas?  Table had salmon and the mix grill. All was excellent, perfectly cooked and well presented. Unfortunately out of Turkish Coffee but offered an digestif in place of and complimentary. Will be here again when I find myself in beechwood."}
{"text":"Fresh food, good service, and good for vegheads.  There is so much good stuff here, I can't eat it alll in one setting! On a recent lunch appointment, we arrived with the bustling beachwood business and shopping crowd, and it was pretty packed by 1145. The appetizer sampler is great. You get some baba, some hummos, some falafel, pita and i think i am forgetting something, Maybe dawali? Anyway it was all very fresh and delicious. It is an upgraded Aladdin's, and there is always one of the family there working the crowd, saying hello. I particularly like supporting a local cleveland family place that has been around forever! They care, it shows in the food.  Salads are good too. My only disappointment is not being able to get the half lentil/half chili soup that i can at Aladdin's. Gonna have to make a trip!  ps - even if you can't pronounce it, eat it. Its good!"}
{"text":"For the record, I didn't give this place a 4 just because of portion size but for authenticity, quality of ingredients, and ambiance.  The pita were steaming hot and fresh out of the oven.  Traditional mezze tasted super fresh, not out of some pre-prepared jar.  Falafel balls were perfectly prepared.  Tabouli was mild and refreshing.  The shwarma, kofta and chicken kabobs were tender and just at the point of doneness, and nothing more. The waitstaff was prompt, knowledgeable and friendly. (And tolerant of my coworkers' best attempts to pick them up...). The ambiance was cozy yet airy and ventilated at the same time.   Kudos to the chef and the rest of the staff!"}
{"text":"Lovely food and very good service. The only thing I didn't like was the shawarma plate. The meat was too \"fatty\". I think it was mostly the oil. Eveything else was delightful."}
{"text":"It was a freezing night and the hostess tried to seat us next to the door with the cold wind blowing on us even though there were multiple open seats in the middle of the restaurant. We had someone else move us.  The food was ok but it felt like we were sitting right on top of the other tables. There was no privacy to have good conversation and the table next to us kept reaching over our table for sugar ( that's how close the seating arrangements are) I definitely prefer the downtown location"}
{"text":"Nice place, I went there for lunch several times the food is good and the menu is giving the opportunity to get something you like for sure.  Nice patio outside during summer time. Service is good. The only thing is you may struggle to park because the parking of the mall is always crowded"}
{"text":"Place was dead, service was slow, food was mediocre at best. The seafood very dried out and over priced. Very disappointed, brought friends here to sample Lebanese fare, should of just went the casual route and went to alladins were it's consistent."}
{"text":"This weekend, my parents and I dined at one of my favorite Cleveland spots, TAZA. Part of the Cleveland-based Aladdin's restaurant chain (which has locations in Chicago, Charlotte, Raleigh, Toledo, Detroit, Columbus, Pittsburgh, Arlington and San Antonio!), Taza is known for its wide variety of traditional mezza (Lebanese for 'tapas,' or appetizers). Taza has been referred to as an upscale Aladdin's. This place is such a staple in my food-life and I am so excited to finally share it with all of you!  Much like Aladdin's (which is also amazing, you should go if there is a location near you!), options are all meant to be shared family-style (include hummus, stuffed grape leaves, pickled turnips, olives and cucumber, and cinnamon-scented sausages). Every meal also begins with (my favorite part!) fresh pita bread, prepared in Taza's beehive oven and served with olives, yogurt and olive oil. I love this bread so much that I normally plan my meal around it! I like enjoying at least 2 pieces, so I normally just order soup so that I don't have to get carried out of the restaurant with a crane. The soup is delicious though, so it's really the best of both worlds! I've had many things of the menu, including fresh, flavorful salads, sandwiches and kebabs. While they are all excellent, nothing tops the doughiness of the pita for me, so I stick to my bread and soup. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. The restaurant owner knows me, the Mister and my family by name -- we come here THAT often. I'd say we go to this restaurant at least 3 times a month.  Taza is a smaller restaurant and has an intimate feel to it. I probably didn't capture it well in the photos, but the lighting is remarkable and very romantic.  All of the action can be observed in the restaurant's open kitchen, which sits behind a glass partition.   TAZA also carries gourmet teas. My favorite flavor (pineapple green tea)  is so refreshing and I cannot find it ANYWHERE else. I look forward to savoring a cup every time I go to TAZA.  As I mentioned before, 9/10 times I order the Chicken Nine Vegetable Soup. It is homemade and includes all the fresh, seasonal veggies TAZA has that week.  But I'll be honest, my favorite part of the meal is the BREAD. These pillowy clouds of heaven are accompanied by a mouth-watering seasame oil dipping sauce, which I could easily guzzle down by the bottle - so delicious ;)  The staff and owners of TAZA are also fabulous and once you go here a few times, they'll remember you by name, too and greet you with a smile (or sometimes a hug!). Hands down, one of my favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"The food is so delicious. I went there just to try the baklava cheesecake, but when I arrived I like the smell and let me try their food. I took the dawllma, and kofta kobab. I like them so much. You have to try their food."}
{"text":"Every time I go to Taza, I never make it past the appetizers- they're perfect!  We usually order a bunch of apps and share them family-style.  The makanek and halloumi cheese, with their pomegranate sauce, are amazingly tangy and sweet.  The kibbeh nayyeh is a delight, especially when drenched with olive oil.  The hummus, fattet hummus, french fries with zaatar, potatoes with cilantro, and tabbouli are also welcome additions to our table.  The best complement to these dishes is Taza's perfectly baked, fresh pita bread.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Wonderful. Wonderful, wonderful! I have eaten here twice, once for lunch and once for dinner. Food seems very authentic and is so fresh and delicious. There are choices for all levels of adventurous (or not so) eaters. The baba (eggplant dip) is nothing short of phenomenal, and the wraps and shawarma are wonderful. Prices very reasonable for the quality and the atmosphere is casual but upscale. Service was wonderful, timely and not overly attentive."}
{"text":"Love love love Taza. Same owners as my all time fav Aladdin's I heard but their pita bread is SOOOOO much better!!"}
{"text":"This formerly solid 5 Star restaurant has slipped to a three plus since general manager Imad's departure.  Any chance of restoring Taza to its former glory?"}
{"text":"Used to be good until new management ruined it. Used to be my go-to in Cleveland, but now drinks take 20 mins, food sits for 15 mins on the lamp while restaurant is empty. The GM is a mentally unstable nutjob who raised his voice to me and cussed me out (told me to go somewhere else) when I pointed out the shortcomings. The staff all openly talk smack about the manager who clearly is unfit to be a McDonalds burger flipper. No rhythm anymore, uninterested staff. This place was great while it lasted, but bad decisions on installing a mentally unstable, incapable GM and the inexcusably poor/slow service that resulted have ruined (sadly) a place that used to be pretty solid."}
{"text":"The only Aladdin I've been to before was in San Diego and it was pretty darn good. I'm pretty positive it is the same that everyone on here is talking about. But we are not reviewing Aladdin here, we are reviewing Taza.  Mezzas we have tried:  Kibbeh Nayeh- Raw, tender beef served with raw onions, olive oil, pepper and salt. At first, we thought the meat was really spicy, but after tasting the meat by itself, it was just the onions that were spicy. Caramelized onions would be better, as it wouldn't be as spicy.   Jibneh- Yummy seared cheese drizzled with olive oil and pomegranate sauce. Jibneh is always a two thumbs up for me.   Hummus- A staple for Mediterranean food. Can't go wrong with hummus.   After our Mezza dishes, I had the shawarma plate. Lamb and beef pieces were all thinly sliced and cooked tomatoes and onions were hidden beneath a bed of seasoned fries. The shawarma plate was pretty \"sour\". Try it with some delicious provided bread and a side of yogurt would be helpful to balance out the sour taste of the shawarma."}
{"text":"I am from out of town and walked by this place and thought it looked good. It was fantastic! I am not a red wine drinker but the server highly recommended the sangria, it was delicious. The falafel was so flavorful and moist! The shawarma platter was fantastic and had great flavor and was a large portion. I can't wait to come back to town so I can come back here!"}
{"text":"Fellow Yelper, Shayna R. and I were wary of coming to Taza recently because we had planned on going for some happy hour drinks at Paladar. Unfortunately, we came when everyone else wanted some happy hour drinks at Paladar and we were absolutely famished. We stumbled (our bodies were shutting down at this point--we needed food!!) down to Taza and debated going in since we were in such a Latin mood, but noticed the $4 martini sign and decided to give it a shot.   We ended up incredibly thankful that Taza advertised their Thursday special so well! What a crowded blessing in disguise our original plan became!  Unfortunately, we got seated at the quiet, hidden \"date table\" and felt like they were trying to hide us from the other guests--were we that sad and hungry looking?! We ended up moving a table closer to the dining area and bar to feel more like part of the group.   Our waiter, Tom (I think) was perfect! He explained the martinis to us and made sure we knew what the best-sellers were so we could make some educated decisions. I went with the Taza-tini and Shayna had the Mango-tini. Both were good, but mango won when we ordered our second round. The pita you get to start your meal is fabulous. Warm, fluffy and SO good. The dipping oil was good, too, though we didn't know what it was...I still enjoyed it!  We shared the Lebanese Jibneh (cheese!!!) and it was probably the most delicious thing I've ever tasted. The pomegranate sauce was so good that I regretted letting Tom (seriously, I'm so sorry if that wasn't his name) take the plate; I wanted to soak the rest of it up with some bread. For an entree, we shared the Shawarma Fatteh. The shawarma was some of the best meat I've ever had--it melted in your mouth and was seasoned perfectly.   We also got to hear and sit right next to the live music! So fun! And the decor was very pretty and didn't strike me as gaudy or tacky, though I really generally don't like the \"garden\" dining seating.   The only complaint I have is that the entree was incredibly heavy. It was overloaded with chickpeas and pita chips and not as much meat, so we ended up super full and starchy, though that was an improvement upon our state when we arrived.   I really hope they keep up the good food and service, because I *almost* feel ashamed of how quickly Taza won me over."}
{"text":"I had been meaning to try Taza for years and finally made the trip with some coworkers.  This place is awesome!  Great food, atmosphere and service.  Much more friendly and attentive service than your typical Cleveland establishment.  Big portions and yummy pita bread to start.  The spicy hummus is some of the best I have had.  There were no complaints at our table....all the entrees were delicious.  Highly recommend if you enjoy Mediterranean food!"}
{"text":"Great food, well priced, but very slow service.   Had the lamb shawarma and it was very tasty."}
{"text":"First impression was great! We walked in and it smelled AMAZING.   Our server was extremely friendly and suggested that we eat family style because there were too many great choices on the menu.  The three of us ordered about 4 appetizers and 2 entrees.  It was an excellent decision!  The food was wonderfully prepared and looked beautiful.  Great atmosphere, great food, and great service. I would totally recommend!!"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant... I was meeting my sister and mother for lunch. I arrived late they had finished there meals. The servers name was Jared he took my order. I ordered hummus and lentil soup. It came rather quick. By the way the lentil soup was awesome. So Jared brings my bill it was $14.04. I gave him a 20 dollar bill and 4 pennies. Jared brings back the folder and I open it and it has 5 dollar bills in it. I say to my family Jared shorted me dollar. My sister says he prob made a mistake and didn't notice. In which I thought how can u make a mistake with that? So I informed Jared when he returned that I was missing a dollar. Jared says to me well I figured you was going to tip me at least a dollar so instead of giving you a five dollar bill and a single I just gave you five singles and kept the other dollar. This was unacceptable and pretty much stealing from a customer. I totally did not appreciate his behavior and he acted as if he did nothing wrong. Watch Jared when you go here..."}
{"text":"Love Taza, which I believe is part of the Aladdin's chain in the area.   I have been here several times for lunch with coworkers and without fail we have always had good food, and a good experience.     I am vegetarian so this restaurant is great because they have many options available, but to be honest, I stick with the Rolled Falafel, because it is just that good.   I have had the regular Rolled Falafel and the Hummus Rolled Falafel (which is Vegan BTW).   They are both just killer, but I prefer the regular over the hummus variation if I had to pick one (which is almost like saying which kid do you like better LOL).  NOTE: The French fries are friggen delish - they have some kind of middle eastern seasoning on them (which is salty so if that ain't your thing be advised) and I recommend them with the rolled falafel.  SECOND NOTE: The bread they give you which is pita and almost like a Roti with flavored oil is also killer so ask for it if they don't give it to you for some reason.   They have always brought it out - even at lunch time and it is nice and hot.  The restaurant is in the insanely crazy, with not enough parking - Eton Center, over off of Chagrin Blvd (which in itself is a zoo) so be prepared for traffic and to have to hunt for a parking space depending on when you go.   The restaurant is clean and the service has always been very good.   I never had to ask for a refill of my water - the server just swung by on a regular basis and topped it off.  I recommend them whole-heartedly if middle eastern fare is your thing.   I have already been back several times."}
{"text":"Thanks for the great service Rubin!  The food was great and your attention to detail and awesome attitude made our lunch great. Thanks man we'll be back!"}
{"text":"High end Aladdin's. Same owners, better selections, but higher prices. Very good service. Everything on the menu is great."}
{"text":"I am giving this place only 4 stars when really I want to give it 5. But I can't. Even though the service was great and our food wonderful, something took place that ruined our meal. The man running the restaurant, an older man, reamed out the staff in front of everyone. It's a small place to begin with, and he started yelling at someone from the hostess stand while walking to the back, still yelling and then shouted at the employees where everyone could hear! It was very uncomfortable to watch, I felt so sorry for them.  I am assuming he is the owner. Well, he has lost our business. Too bad for all..."}
{"text":"I was grounded in Cleveland with an ice storm back in Chicago.  I had to get a room and dinner on my own before the storm moved into the area later that night.  I did a quick Yelp Search for Mediterranean food and Taza came to the top of the list.  Quick Uber ride over and I was there.  What a great place to be carved into a \"upper\" end shopping center.  I started with \"hummos\" plate.   The portion was enough for two but just right for me (I put some in the to-go box).  Pita's were warm and had a very nice fresh bakery smell to them.  It was well seasoned as to not over power the chickpeas with to many spices.  Main course was the Mujadara- steamed lentils with Lebanese salata and garnished with toasted onions.  My mouth is watering thinking about it.  it was a great mixture of warm lentils and fresh salata.  The fried onions were crisp and tasty with the rest.  It was a healthy portion and took the rest home in in the to-go box.  Looking forward to my next \"stranded in Cleveland\"  event to go back, but I will not wait for that if given the chance.  Well worth the trip there."}
{"text":"Always a great meal here.  I usually go to the location downtown so this was my first time at Eton.  Shish kebabs, lamb kebabs, and shish tawook were loved by all.  The major winners on the table were the salads, house wood - fired bread and french fries...I have had the fries before so I sold the table on how good they were and everyone gobbled them up.  Nice bar to pop in and have a drink.  Fast and efficient service for a Friday night around 7pm.  Total tab for 3 adults with bevvie and a kid, with tip, was $120."}
{"text":"There's a lot of competition with Lebanese food in Cleveland. Taza is the upscale option, and they have a nice bar and outdoor seating area. I've been a few times on a weekend night without a reservation, and have sat at the bar for dinner, which is what we did tonight. I have to say the bar service was a 5. The bartender was on point with everything, despite having several people eating dinner and a regular stream of take out customers - and she didn't seem stressed at all. We got our appetizer about 3 minutes after she took our order. The food is consistently 4 stars. I pretty much always order the Taza chicken salad. It's a huge portion - easily make 2 meals. The baba and hummus are good, but I personally prefer Aladdin's for those two dishes. Taza definitely wins on ambiance and service."}
{"text":"Been there a lot.  Ate outside.  Waiter was fine.  Food was just fine.  Smoothie was too runny and not smooth.  They took it off the bill, ok?  Still wanted a smotthie. Probably the biggest problem is that they wear these ties that are FILTHY!  Really, I don't want my food to touch those dirty ties.  I get putting a tie on makes you look crisper, but if it's filthy, it doesn't work.  All wait staff ties were filthy, not just mine."}
{"text":"Not only is the food always fantastic, but the people are really great too. I recently left a personal article at the table and went to get it the next day -- so dumb on my part to leave it yet I got it back in one piece. Thank you! I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Although I rarely eat at establishments housed in malls, this restaurant and the mall itself are unique.  My selections of Loubie and the Seared Cod entree were excellent.  I am thankful for Krystal the Bartender for her gracious assistance in selecting and ordering this mostly unfamiliar to me ethnic food."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! The baba and hummus are amazing! The lentil and coucous soups were both delicious! The portions are huge! A must go to!!"}
{"text":"Similar menu to Aladdin's Eatery, but higher-end atmosphere and higher-end pricing.  Noisier, too.  Food and service are both fine."}
{"text":"We had high hopes for this place, however we will not be returning. Limited menu, small portion sizes, slow service, and overly Americanized food. Middle Eastern cuisine is supposed to be fresh and flavorful; the options here taste more like they came from a commercial vendor. We will go to Aladdin's instead; way more options, better portions, quick service, and more authentic options."}
{"text":"Ok, being a European having eaten real shoarma, donner, and kabob, I still have to find the real thing here in the US. But...this place is really good! Very friendly staff too! Will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Came here with friends for a late lunch.  Since the place wasn't busy at the time, the service was prompt and nice.  The food was pretty good and the prices are about the same as most middle eastern restaurants...maybe a little more because it is definitely one of the nicer middle eastern restaurants that I've been to.  But for that little increase in price, they give you a lot of food, which lucky for us, we were sharing most of it.  Overall, the place is a good place to eat when you're in the area, but it's nothing extraordinary that would make me drive here if I had a craving for middle eastern food...then again, I live 45 mins away.  If I lived closer, I might show up a little more often."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and I have always enjoyed my experience.  I love the pita that they provide, and their hummus is great. My favorite item is the lamb dinner, and the lamb is flavorful and it has never been too tough or strong flavored. And I have never waited long here for food, but it has been busy and the parking can be tricky depending on what time of day it is."}
{"text":"This place has some good Lebanese food.  That's about all you need to know, but I will give you some more.  First, the pita is incredible.  They bake it fresh there in their stone oven.  Sometimes it is so hot you have to be careful when it comes in the basket.  The wraps are really good.  There is one wrap that is only a one liner on the menu- the Baba Wrap.  Get that, it is the best one by far.  The hummus and other wraps will satisfy, but the baba is incredible.  The wraps come with fries automatically, which I sometimes get (with a couple extra hot sauce sides- that stuff is out of this world) or change up to the cous-cous which is chock full of herbs and very pleasant.    I am a salad eater, but refuse to eat any at Taza.  For some reason the lettuce always has a woody mouth-feel to me that I just can't get over.  I am not a huge fan of their dressings either.  Most of the apps are good, so try and work your way around the menu a little bit.  If you don't get a baba or hummus wrap, be sure that you order some for an appetizer.  They are both fresh and delicious.  In the summer, it is great to sit on the patio and soak up the sun.  The only issue is that most of the tables get blasted by direct sun, so choose carefully.  The inside of the restaurant is always packed up, so make sure you get there with some time to spare.  My biggest complaint about Taza isn't with the restaurant itself, but the parking lot.  I hate when I have to park in the next state because the entire lot is full.  Again, make sure that you get there early to avoid the annoyance, particularly in bad weather."}
{"text":"Came here last night after leaving a packed Cheesecake Factory (60 minute wait for Cheesecake Factory? Whaa?).  Somewhat urgently looking for a place to eat, we stumbled upon Tazos, located near the Menchies across from the new Trader Joe's.  Reviews were decent and there wasn't much of a line.  A man who I suspect was the owner or manager greeted us at the entrance and we were seated within about 5 minutes.  Take that Cheesecake.   Decor is tasteful and different.  Definitely a step up from Aladdins with a slightly higher price to match.  We got the Tazo sampler which was generally excellent.  Highlights for me where the wonderful beef swarma and the freshly baked puffed up pita bread.  I could eat that all day.  We were a little bit underwhelmed by the grilled chicken.  My wife says that usually there is some. Sort of garlic sauce but there was none on this platter.  It was a little dry without it.   We also ordered the grilled cod which had a tasty tomato spicy topping on it.  It was pretty good, especially with the topping but I probably wouldn't order it again and I probably wouldn't get the fries either, though they were tasty and hot.  Not that different from normal fries.    Service was excellent and we enjoyed our experience.  We'll be back for the shwarma and pitas."}
{"text":"Aladdins was always a fave of mine at Ohio State.  Now with my man in Cleveland and a friend working at Taza, we stopped in for a nice outdoor dinner this past holiday weekend.    I was expecting a menu different from Aladdins but it was pretty similar, in fact containing my favorite meal!  I couldnt have been happier.  The rice is my all time favorite food.  I tried to recreate it at home and failed terribly.  It is amazinggggggg.  I enjoy the shishtawook and the garlic sauce in it is stronger then strong so if you feel like kissing anyone, or even speaking to someone in the following 48 hours, take mints!    The pita was warm and fresh and smelled incredible.  Hummus was eh, but my man liked it a lot.  Of coarse the service was impeccable too!  :)"}
{"text":"Amazing Food!  I have eaten Mediterranean food in many big cities and no where has the food ever been any better than what we are at Taza. Matt was our waiter and he was very knowledgable about the menu. The potatoes with lemon, garlic and cilantro was delicious as was the hummus and main dishes. If you get an opportunity to eat here don't miss it."}
{"text":"Love it here! Check it out on Wednesday nights for a wonderful special (buy a bottle of wine and get any app free) take a couple girlfriends and you're guaranteed to have a fun night.  The service is also really good and makes the experience that much nicer. Lastly, the fresh bread/pita pockets they serve are like little pillows of heaven. I rarely eat bread and this is just too good to pass on. We also love the veggie appetizer plate. Tons of food and lots of variety."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time here, the previous time was maybe 3-4 years ago. My first experience was good, I believe I took the safe route and got a salad. The second time around , I was really unsure what to get at first. But after watching all the delicious plates coming from the kitchen the decision on what to get started to narrow down. I ended up getting the Mix Grill 1 which is pictured below along with a falafel appetizer! The pictures don't do it justice! The meal overall was phenomenal, I'm not a huge lamb guy but they prepared It very well. Along with the chicken and beef as well. It looks like and is a lot of food but it really is a light eat. This place definitely made me a fan of the Lebanese cuisine! If you looking for a great lunch or dinner switch up, definitely give Taza a try!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars: The restaurant is beautifully decorated with exotic Middle-Eastern hints through out the restaurant.  It has a slightly intimate atmosphere with a beautiful outdoor patio to eat on.  The restaurant has a large open kitchen that faces the dining room and large bar next to the kitchen.     The manager, Ahmod (spelling?), was so nice and provided fairly accurate interpretations of the food.  He was super energetic in his explanations and suggestions.  However, his bartender was a little less enthusiastic and wasn't very engaging.  She seemed annoyed when I asked about specialty drinks, so I settled with a Lebanese beer.  I ordered the Ahi Tuna and the Cod entrees with Phoenician salads.  The cod was excellent and cooked perfectly- moist, flakey, with a lightly brown crust.  The chunky tomato sauce was slightly spicy with capers? (i believe).  I wasn't a huge fan of the sauce that went on the cod.  The cod spoke for itself :).  I loved the vegetarian bulgar that went with it.  The bulgar was nicely seasoned with little chickpeas and carrots, moist, soft, and hit all the right places- it's turned into a comfort food :D.  The Ahi tuna was overcooked and tough; I wasn't crazy about the little pesto sauce that was served with it.  The couscous was soft with a slight bite to it.  It was good, but I still prefer my vegetarian bulgar :D.  The Phoenician salads were nice and refreshing with candied walnuts, feta, spring mix, and dried cranberries.  The salad dressing has a oil base with light spices.  The candied walnuts were good, lightly sweet.  Their baked pitas are fresh out of the oven and are sweet to taste at first and unique with the sesame dipping sauce.    The Phoenician salad and the cod are must haves, skip the Ahi Tuna.  However, they are known for their hummos, so I will be sure to get that platter next time!"}
{"text":"Great service, ambience and of course amazing food! Lots of good options for vegetarians as well! They have live music on Thursdays! It's one of the best middle eastern restaurants in Cleveland and surely my fav!!! Love their fresh warm pita with zatar, Lebanese Jibneh, vegetarian feast platter, Chicken Kafta & Mujadra!"}
{"text":"Located in a very nice shopping center (Eton Square) we enjoyed a nice Lebanese dinner. Service was so nice and accommodating  as we closed up the restaurant since we were having a sort of reunion dinner.  We started with the Tour of Lebanon vegetarian platter with hummus, falafel, toboulie salad and buba gannoush. I've had better, but it was a good quality hummus and toboulie.  I split an Ahi Tuna grilled filet dinner with very very good soft rice and perfectly spiced and done fresh vegetables. The tuna was slightly pink and I preferred it more medium rare but garlic sauce was a perfect accompaniment to the tuna.  Their wine selection is good and their coffee very aromatic and tasty."}
{"text":"Inconsistent. The chicken shawarma tasted like very plain, dry chicken, made with no marinade. It used to be very flavorful. Adding pickled vegetables to every sandwich just interferes with and overwhelms  the flavors that should be there. Our baba had so much garlic tonight that we could not finish it, but when we ordered it a month ago, it was fine... but other items were not. This restaurant was so much better 5 years ago and has gone slowly downhill. What happened?"}
{"text":"The service here is amazing! It was attentive without being overdone, and friendly. It made for a really relaxing, nice meal after I had spent all day moving.  I came with some of my friends and we ordered a variety of dishes. I can't comment on what they ordered (they said the lamb tartare and shish lamb entrees were delicious) but as a table, we got the Taste of Taza appetizer. It comes with a variety of vegetarian and meat items to share. Everything tasted fresh and burst with flavor. I usually don't like the combination of pickled turnips, cucumbers and tomatoes, but I actually quite enjoyed this!  I ordered the beef kafta rolled pita for myself, which comes with fries. Again, also delicious. It has a garlic sauce already in there, and unlike most places that drench the sauce to cover up the taste of everything else, this one was perfectly done. Sure, a little bit dripped onto my plate, but that meant I got to dip the fries in it. Yum! The fries also come with some toasted sesame seeds on top.  One of the best things about this place is the bread. It's fresh pita bread, and ask for refills! It was hot, steamy and delicious. They bring you two kinds, one is in the triangle shape, and the other looks like a puffed up saucer. The latter is amazing and super fun to eat! Rip it open and some of the steam hits you in the face.  This is a place to sort of \"splurge\" for a meal, so do watch your wallet."}
{"text":"The food is good and right on par with Aladdin's Eatery, however, it is about 20% more expensive.  I don't know how they justify this.  Maybe it's the pretentious decor."}
{"text":"First meal in Cleveland on our 48 hour trip was here. Great restaurant (considering it's a chain). Great outdoor seating and people watching. We shared lots of great dishes. Sweetest waitress ever. Would totally go back here.  Plus they had a Riesling named HARPER :)"}
{"text":"I joke that Taza is Alladin's with nice plates, but that is not really true. The food is finer and the fresh hot pitas remind me of Detroit (sorry I have never been to Lebanon).  The basics are Tabouli, Baba Ganoush and Hummus. They are all delicious and deserve to be shared by your table. If you start with the lentil soup, you will love it but it may fill you up. I rarely get the Mujadara plate, but when I do, I love it. The combination of rice, lentils and crispy onions is addictive and it makes for a nice dinner plate.  For lunch you will struggle between the rolls (Falafel & Lamb rolls kick major butt) which come with delicious spicy fries (no ketchup required - dieters may elect the healthy cous cous) and the Salads. I get the Falafel Salad because the balls are crispy on the outside and fresh on the inside. I get the house vinagrette and the tahini dressing which is rich and creamy.  What do you need to know? The Hot Sauce on the side is worth the extra 50 cents. I sometimes get a side container for home, yeah that is how I roll. The Hot sauce is the worst best kept secret in Cleveland and truly \"Hot in Cleveland.\""}
{"text":"My parents live for this place. Every time the family gets together, odds are we are either getting carry out or dining at Taza. When the mad Greek went out of business we ran out of options. I would put this restaurant above the rest."}
{"text":"The food, atmosphere, and service were great.  Rated 4 because of above average pricing (due to great atmosphere probably :-)"}
{"text":"Everything was delicious! Great service and super considerate! The pita was fresh and hot which added to the satisfactory. Looking around paying approx $15 a person."}
{"text":"Went there on Sunday night (about 15 of us). Very disappointing experience from my point of view. The appetizer (Taste of Taza was okay, nothing special), my main course was horrible. First, I got Hummos Shawarma - it was inedible. Hummus was very watery and beef was kind of swimming it and beef was very salty and vinegary. So I sent it back (I rarely sent food back) and asked to replace it with Shawarma Plate, which was not any better. Beef was way over-salted and was not good at all. And that was not just for me, most people at our table food was over-salted and one person's fish (tuna) was not prepared correctly at all. I have been to Taza few times and did a carryout order many times and had good experience prior to this. I am not sure if the chef was having an off-night or place is going down in general but I won't be back to find out. Pretty bad experience overall."}
{"text":"Excellent fresh food at reasonable prices, very friendly waitress and even briefly met The pleasant owner , I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Delicious food that is completely satisfying. Very well cooked and tasty you could be full from appetisers alone ! So my advice to you is first order your appetisers like hummus, kibbie, grape leaves and Baba with the mouthwatering pita bread that they make coupled with a drink of your choice (smoothie or mint)and then see if you can fit an entree or main dish afterwards."}
{"text":"4.5 stars for dinner, 5 stars for lunch! I'll go back for lunch for sure--prices are great, and everything is SO delicious! Especially the appetizers that my group shared today.   I have no complaints, but I wish the dinner prices weren't sometimes twice as much as the lunch prices.   Huzzah for Taza!"}
{"text":"Simply outstanding! First time visiting Taza and were pleasantly surprised how good it was. Beautiful large dining room and nice patio seating as well. Very nice menu, options from hummus, salads, rolled pita and exceptional main entrees. The only downside to today's experience was after being seated for about ten minutes the hostess noticed our server had not come to our table. So she decided to take care us and take our order, bless her heart. Once our server noticed the hostess doing her job she brought she brought us some pita bread, but didn't say a word to us. And when we got ready to leave we couldn't find her to get our check so again we asked the hostess to handle it and she did. I was never really sure if we actually had a waitress.  While you are waiting for your food they bring you complimentary pita and olive oil. The pita was really great, Fresh and warm. The food we ordered was Lebanese Jibneh (grilled Lebanese cheese, pomegranate sauce, pistachios, tomatoes and kalamata olives). This was a great starter, the cheese was nice and warm and the sauce had great layers of flavor, a little sweet and a little tart. I ordered the mixed grill (lamb kabob, chicken kabob, beef kafta, grilled veggies and rice). All the meat was grilled and seasoned perfectly. They were really tender and juicy. Love the touch of cinnamon, almond slivers on the rice, really flavorfull. The garlic dipping sauce was out of sight. Be careful it is strong!  My wife orderd the Samakeh Tajin (char grilled salmon with Tajin walnut cilantro sauce with grilled veggies). Some of the best salmon ever. The seasoning was outstanding and it was super tender and flakey. Great experience, will definetly be a regular go to spot."}
{"text":"Food and beer was good. I ordered a kebab and it was really good, and we had a Lebanese import beer that was interesting. The waiter wasn't all in it that night though. I couldn't tell if he was new or busy or what. I ordered small and my colleague ordered large. Now I'm a bigger guy than my colleague, and I think they gave us the same size or swapped the order sizes. Not the end of the world but I wanted the smaller portion. Then my colleague ordered a glass of red wine and was given a bottle of champagne. When he pointed out that champagne bottle wasn't red wine, the waiter was confused. It was really bizarre. All in all, service wasn't horrible and the food was great but they need to tighten up the screws a little bit."}
{"text":"Place hits the spot when I come back to Cleveland. Shish Tawook platter, mujadara..I could go on. Really just as good, if not better than any place I go to in LA. Same Lebanese dishes as other places, but just incredibly well executed on flavor+quality."}
{"text":"I've been to this location many times, but this time stood out due to the impeccable service.  I've never had a bad meal here, but the service is sometimes iffy.  The last time I visited, I left without dining, due to the service.  This time was much different.  My host/server Ashley was WONDERFUL.  She greeted and seated me, immediately upon entering the restaurant.  She then proceeded to take my order.  I ordered the Shish Tawook meal and taboulleh.  The taboulleh arrived first, it's a little bit pricier than other establishments, but always tasty.  The bread starter with olive oil and zatar for dipping is always a hit.  The main meal was tasty too, lots of freshly grilled veggies, perfectly marinated chicken and rice....yum!  Ashley was SO attentive, my water glass was never full, and in noticing the tables that she served around me, she never lost track of which customer needed attention.  Great Job Ashley, thank you for the great dining experience!"}
{"text":"Lamb Kabob was delightful! Beautiful plate that was well prepared. Loved the warm pitas with dipping oil. At the conclusion of my meal I was prepared to declare I'd return, but then the service just declined. Our server had checked on us early on, but later she never looked our way. She seemed to have mastered servicing other guests because I watched her. I waved my hand after she passed by numerous times, nothing. I finally got the attention of another sever who summoned her and again it wasn't immediate. There was no apology or explanation for the oversight, wait or error with the bill. We sat for about 45 minutes after we completed our meal just waiting for her to wrap us up. I hope this is an isolated event, but it really eroded the good vibes I had about the place. The food was great, but doubt I'll return."}
{"text":"I absolutely love taza.  I've had nothing but good experiences with the staff and love their appetizer pita bread."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely good and the service was fast & friendly (thanks Dwayne). First time this area.....great place. I ordered the nine vegetable soupand my entree was the Samakeh Tajin (grilled salmon w/tahani sauce & grilled veggies)"}
{"text":"Much like Aladdin's the food here is good.  I especially like the appetizers and the Beef Kafta dinner.  Everything is dressed up a bit from Aladdin's including the ambience.    Sometimes the tables in the middle of the restaurant can get a bit too noisy.  In the summer, the patio is a really nice change of pace."}
{"text":"Was looking for a new place for my mom and I to enjoy dinner as we finished up our yearly summer trip to Cleveland for some shopping. We had been to the Eton plaza before, and I see it has upgraded a bit since then. I waivered between 3 and 4 stars for here.    We arrived at 8:30 on a Tuesday and it was pretty busy, but we didn't have to wait. Definitely agree that it can get a bit loud in here and we noticed that when we came in.  The overall look of the place is sort of chain-restauranty. They did some work to make it have a middle eastern feel, but it is fairly generic I think. They have a lot of tables squished in, along with the bar. We were seated to the side of the door next to the bar, so we had a bit of a wall blocking us from the noise and no one as close as the rest of the restaurant seating was.  Our waitress Natasha was super friendly and jovial. I think she had many tables scattered around, so even though she wanted to check in, it would take her awhile to come back. She verbally noticed when bringing the pita and za'atar that I was ready for a refill, but didn't make it back for over 5 minutes. While waiting for a box, or the check, it was just a little longer than you would expect, especially since it cleared out as we were eating.  We both went with the iced teas. Pomegranate for mom and Black for me. They were super flavorful and tasty and we both had about 3 glasses. For dinner, I went with the Shish Tawook and mom the Mujadara. It looks like the menu stays the same through the day, but they offer a large or small option. We both went with the small plate (around $10-12 for most items), and it was more than enough for dinner.  Loved the hot, fresh pita with za'atar/oil dipping sauce.  My plate came with about 6-7 smaller chunks of of chicken from a skewer for the Shish Tawook. I was honestly expecting a little bit more meat, but what I had was moist and flavorful. The garlic sauce that accompanied it was sooo garlicy and delicious, but would take out a few vampires, so just be aware. The grilled veggies were mainly made up of 4 large sections of cauliflower which I don't like (mom got them), a little squash/zucchini and onion. The rice was tasty and a majority of the plate. It filled me up. Just a little pricey for one small skewer to me.  Mom's really liked her Mujardara. She was pleased with the amount of lentils as she was concerned it would be too rice-heavy. It was a very large amount and she was able to take half of it home. The salata on top was not extensive, but it gave it some color.   Overall, we liked the experience. I think we lucked out getting the table behind the bar area with how raucous the rest of the restaurant seemed. I think it may have lost a star otherwise. Service was friendly, yet a little delayed. Prices decent, but when rice takes up a lot of the plate/meal, it isn't the greatest value with minimal meat.  If I am back in Cleveland, I would definitely like to come again."}
{"text":"You call this Lebanese?   Now I may be picky when it comes to falafel. It is a favorite of mine but this place had more problems than just overcooked falafel.   We were sat at a table where you could see the oven and the pita. Well I found the gas open air oven laughable and the pita. . .way too leavened. After we had ordered the waitress brought some of the not so great pita and this oil spice mix. The oil spice mix was WAY TOO SALTY.   Our food did come fast which was a pleasant surprise. Though the food was disappointing. My falafel was so over cooked. The exterior was nearly black while the middle was like paste. eww. The 2 dressings that came with the salad were nothing special. The tahini was exactly what you get at Aladins, and the lemon dressing just tasted like lemon infused olive oil. . .only more greasy. I don't know what my date had nor could I care much less after watching him check out every girl that walked by.  But I will say this french fries under no circumstance are Lebanese. After the horrid date I had had I was more horrified with the wait to get the check. OVER 20 MINUTES!! way too long for it being nearly empty.   Don't miss Um the chairs were nice. . .   Hit or miss Service  Avoid Like the plague: This place  On a final note I can't believe how many people thought this place was good. Honestly if you want good middle eastern food go to Kan Zaman your money will be better spent."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great value for money, fast and friendly service.  We had beef shawarma and falafel pitas and both were fantastic.  Mine (the falafel) I got with fresh grilled vegetables and my husband (the shawarma) got fries.  Both were delicious.  Meals come with the most delicious, warm (even hot!) bread while you're waiting, too.  Price was excellent ($9 each!) and our server was friendly.  If we were locals we'd come back regularly!"}
{"text":"Taza is a really great restaurant. The menu is large, service is friendly, there is a large outdoor eating area, a grill inside, and the food is fabulous. I've been here multiple times and I don't think I've ever ordered anything I didn't like. I'm also very picky when it comes to middle eastern food because I've spent considerable time in Israel and Taza doesn't disappoint.  The prices are extremely reasonable for the portions and the quality. I love the the soft fresh pita and the complimentary zatar olive oil dip is wonderful. Some favorites I've ordered include the fatoosh salad- so fresh and delicious filed with herbs and the shwarma hummus- delicious, authentic and plenty to share with a group."}
{"text":"I get to work in Cleveland infrequently but when I am here I usually have a couple weeks that I need to find different but quality food to eat.  Taza has been mentioned to me many times and since I have yet to eat at a Lebanese restaurant, I encouraged a group outing of the same. I am unable to name all the foods I tried, but I did not eat one bad thing. This place is definitely worth a try.   I would like to go back as several tables around us ordered some delicious looking salads I want to try."}
{"text":"The entire east side east of i271 seems nearly devoid of any Mediterranean cuisine, which is sad. Taza fills that void with delicious kebabs that would \"skewer\" the competition. Wait, there is none. Oh well, order the hummus, baba ganoush, various wraps and appetizers. They have a delicious garlic mayo condiment that's similar to Nate's, but be warned, it's intense enough to stay on your breath for a few days and yet still remain effective enough to kill a few vampires. 4 stars!"}
{"text":"Great venue, but super expensive for the food portions. They are definitely taking advantage of the location. All the meat portions were super small, I honestly thought that they were the kids menu items. Lots of rice and just overpriced.   I always eat at Mediterranean restaurants, read my other reviews. This one was definitely a ripoff."}
{"text":"I don't understand why this place is more expensive than Aladdin's when it's pretty much the same thing. Most of the menu items are literally the same as well, just more expensive. Are you just paying for location or????   HOWEVER, I will say the hummus is better here. It's thicker (Aladdin's tends to be more runny) and the hot sauce is actually spicy.   The food is yummy and I love how fresh everything is and how you don't feel \"weighed down\" after your meal. The FRESHLY BAKED PITA can be dangerous though. Those carbs are worth the coma.   Definitely give it a shot if you're in the area, but if you're ballin' on a budget-- go to Aladdin's. Same stuff, just cheaper."}
{"text":"Note that this review is for takeout only.  We grabbed some takeout here on Mother's Day around noon, and there was a special 3 course prix fixe on offer for the occasion.  It was also available for carryout, so we opted for one prix fixe order and one a la carte order.  The special $20 menu included a choice of appetizer, lunch entree, and a piece of baklava for dessert.  I think this place has changed management in the last year or so.  I can't recall exactly when, but it was probably around the time they changed the stone oven into a toaster belt.  Somehow that fresh pita isn't as good as it was before.  Perhaps it's the temperature of the machine or perhaps they don't flatten the dough enough (as the circles are not as wide in diameter), but the pockets of the pita don't form properly, and the bread is thicker than it used to be.  That aside, the food is still very good -- if you dine in.  Unfortunately, carryout quality control has suffered.  On this visit, they forgot to include the baklava, and our order was waaaaay overcooked.  Medium rare turned into well done.  They have also started charging 65c for sauces now, which is a bit annoying in and of itself, but when I get takeout and they forget to put it in -- twice in a row now! -- or when it does come and there is barely any sauce in the container, I start to consider alternative takeout places instead.  By the time I realize what's missing/wrong, it's not worth it for me to drive back to deal with it.  The food here is still fresh, and the food is seasoned well, but I would recommend sticking with dining in rather than carrying out."}
{"text":"I had been to Taza one or two time in the past few years for lunches with my mom and loved it, but had never really thought of it as a fun place for dinner and drinks - I was so wrong!   I'm pretty sure our server's name was Tom too, and he was great. He let us switch tables without acting inconvenienced and was super attentive and sweet to us all evening. He was conversational and fun and even brought us some baklava to apologize for a (pretty short) wait when we were first seated. Really just an all-around great server!  If you want to know about the food and drinks, read Kaitlin D.'s review, because I agree with 99% of what she said. The only things I really have to add are that I loved the entree - it was just better when I avoided the pita chips in it, and that the fries that I remember having at lunch with my mom are yummy too. And yeah, I can't not mention that amazing jibneh - it's AMAZING. It's one of those things that I won't be able to not order any time I go to Taza.  Overall, the perfect service, delicious food, and wonderful drinks and entertainment definitely caught me off guard, and I'll be frequenting Taza much more regularly after this great experience!"}
{"text":"Not for people who don't like flavor. The Taste of Taza is a great place to start, with the Cilantro Potatoes being a surprising but excellent interlude that packs a flavor punch of lemony goodness."}
{"text":"Delicious food.  Warm, friendly service.  I love the fresh pita here.  Usually, my wife & I will share a \"Taste of Taza\" app, and a pita roll (usually the lamb).  It's a ton of food for us.  Good for vegetarians.  Our kids like it too (a plus!).  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I was really impressed with the food and service! The live music was also an extra bonus. It's a nice place to go on a first date or with co workers. The menu us extensive and has a lot of good things to offer. The bread they give you is also a really goos starter!"}
{"text":"I'm in the middle when it comes to Taza. Over the years I've come to realize that I've transitioned into seeking value (as well as many other things) in my dining experiences.   That's where I struggle with Taza...  I love Aladdin's. I really like Taza--I don't like the price difference. And honestly, besides a few upgrades I didn't really notice a difference. There are so many options to eat healthy on both menus, which I really appreciate. And everything I've tried is very tasty--so that's why Taza still gets 4 stars. Furthermore, the service both my mother and I received on our last visit was 5-star, for sure.   But Aladdin's is really just as good. And that price difference just bothers me to no end. I guess you're paying more for the location??  I will say their mango iced tea is awesome. So is their Lebanese Salata, which I usually add grilled chicken to. Their chicken is always perfectly seasoned and cooked."}
{"text":"I like Taza but I don't see how it is that different than Aladdin's other than having slightly nicer decor & higher prices.   The food is incredibly similar to Aladdin's. The open fire tandoor oven is part of the dining room and adds a nice ambience and some fire roasted dishes, but but has the effect of making the air very very dry, so much that the whole time we were there I wanted to beg every server that passed to please bring more water (honestly, I can't remember the last time I was thirsty, my throat almost hurt and the same for my dinner companion).  The meal was very good. It is a little challenging to eat at the table at this restaurant are very small, but each meal involves many small plates (a small place of sauces, of olives, of bread, etc) as well as candles, silverware and glasses, it was really hard to manuever without knocking something off the table.  The portions are larger than Aladdin's, but for similar food I think I would just go there instead. Of course Taza would be better for a dinner date as it is a bit more upscale."}
{"text":"Can't wait to go back!!  We were over in the area shopping and decided to stop in for lunch.  They started off with fresh hot pita bread which was tasty with all the different sauces to dip it in.  As a vegetarian I was in heaven!! So many options!! The grilled cheese app looks amazing too.  The people next to us got and I wish we would of gotten it too."}
{"text":"Great fresh out of the stone oven pitas, wonderful baklava, great bar and most importantly, great service. Wonderful spectrum of selections on the menu. It should be a default eatery when thinking about what to eat. Doesn't get stale, and neither do the pitas!"}
{"text":"I would not consider myself an expert on Middle Eastern food, but Taza is good food, no matter the cuisine.  The food is very fresh and generally prepared correctly.  The servers are usually attentive, and the decor is nice.  The only complaint I would have is it seems to be a bit pricey for what you're getting, but I'm sure part of that is the location (the rent at Eton must be sky high).  I have family members that are Middle Eastern and they love this place, so that's a good sign."}
{"text":"The best Lebanese food around! The hummus is heavenly, and the baba too. The real treat is the hot bread just out of the open oven, very similar to what we've had overseas. Food is wonderful, fresh, delicious. One of our favorite places in Cleveland. Super nice atmosphere too!"}
{"text":"Far and away the best Lebanese dinner we have had.  We enjoyed trying red and white Lebanese wines and a Lebanese beer.  My wife loved her lamb kabobs and my cod with middle eastern seasoning was great.  Service is top-notch.  Our server was knowledgeable and helpful.  The staff really hustles to get you food done fast, and delivered to you hot."}
{"text":"I feel kinda bad writing this and only giving them two stars.. mostly because I'm just not a fan of this type of food and not the most adventitious  person when it comes to trying new things..   so I guess if you're a middle america type eater my review is for you!  The menu was a bit confusing, not sure that I would have known what to get if I wasn't here with other people.   Eventually I landed on a wrap, that once it go to the table was.. well just plain.  I could get that at subway and pay much less for it.   The staff was nice, the decor is attractive, but the food was just blah to me."}
{"text":"Service was excellent from our waiter Jon. His recommendations were right on the spot. Our food came quickly. Will come back and hope to get the same waiter"}
{"text":"I generally like mediterranean/lebanese food, and the number of restaurants serving it has been increasing over the last few years.  This location is relatively small, in the busy, congested Eton Collection.  Parking is always a challenge.  Nice menu selection, with many diverse items that suit a variety of tastes.  Complementary pita bread is very good.  I was there for lunch, and the lunch portions were good sized for the price.  Food was well prepared and served warm.  Service was timely and attentive.  I had the seared ahi tuna, and it was very well prepared.  Would recommend."}
{"text":"Met some ladies here after work and despite the food not being my normal taste, I really enjoyed my meal of steak kabobs and rice. And let me just say that my steak was cooked EXACTLY how I requested. Our server was pretty good too, and a guy I believe was a manager of some sort was very friendly as well. I would definitely dine here again."}
{"text":"I think I need to come back to Taza and try another dish before i set my final judgment here. I came here for dinner with some of my coworkers and all in all, i like it. Here's a quick (not so quick) summary.  Atmosphere (3): It's a nice classy sit down dinner. But the echoes in the room just isn't very good. We had a table of 6 and I had a hard time hearing across the table because it was just...very loud in the restaurant.  Food (3.5): It was good & average. I have yet to find a Mediterranean place in Cleveland that beats Aladdin Eatery (quality, quantity, and price combined). The food at Taza was good if it was about $5 cheaper. Here's how I came to a food rating of 3.5:  1. Side bread + Hummus (3.5) -- nicely made bread, nicely made hummus. It's delicious but so are all the other Mediterranean places I've been. Although, i loved the sesame seed sauce that came with the bread!  2. French Fries Appetizer (4.5) -- yum! It was perfectly fried with just a touch of seasoning on it. And how come I never knew how good fries + hummus was??  3. Hummos Chicken Entree (3) -- Very good portion, but the chicken wasn't very tender & it lacked flavor. I've had chicken at other Mediterranean restaurants in Cleveland where the chicken meat was full of flavor and extremely tender and that's how I like my meat. But at Taza, it was just okay.  Price (3.5) -- pricey, but it is in Eaton Square so you've got to give it a slack.  Service (4) -- good. The waitress was attentive and made sure we were always satisfied with our meal, checking on us from time to time.  On a side note, one of my coworker ordered the Hummos Shwarma and I was drooling watching him eat it. Next time I come back, I think that's what I'm going to order. Until then, I haven't completely ruled out Taza yet.. so I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great meal served by friendly people.  Lively atmosphere!  If you like spicy food from the Middle East, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Most people in Cleveland are acquainted with Aladdin's for a quick lunch or dinner of Lebanese food. However, if you're looking for a nicer dinner with a great atmosphere Taza's is your place. They make their own fresh pita, playfully names \"puffy pita\" by some, served with olive oil and zataar. I'd highly recommend ordering any of the meat products as they are each grilled to perfection on what must be a wood fire grill.   My favorite plate is the Lamb Plate that can be ordered in two sizes, depending how much meat you want (I recommend eating it with the garlic sauce). The perfect wine pairing is the red Adyar wine. This wine is made in Lebanon and can only be found at Taza's or Aladdin's"}
{"text":"Been here twice and will keep coming.  This place is amazing.  LOVE the food and the staff is great as well.  The owner is as nice as they get.  The wood fired grill makes the meat.  Everthing we had was excellent and the Hummas Fattah is a MUST for an appetizer.   Sooooo good."}
{"text":"The food is incredible, and the service is beyond exceptional. We had a server named Michael, who felt like a family friend by the end of the night. He is the best server I have ever had at any restaurant EVER. I am looking forward to returning to Taza and trying more things on the menu!!"}
{"text":"i travel to Cleveland often from NYC for business and to see my father. I try to stop into Taza. The food is great and the staff delightful. Crystal is a delight as the bartender - very capable and attractive. I've seen her handle a rude take out guest who was having a breakdown about the number of pitas in his order...... well they are homemade but  c'mon dude show a little dignity!!!"}
{"text":"amazing place....great food... cheaper if you go for lunch costlier for dinner.. right from the zatar (pita bread + chutney) to the wine everything was fantastic."}
{"text":"It was OK. Four Wait staff walked past me without greeting me including a few that made eye contact, until the person came to seat us. My order was wrong; the food I was brought was pretty good, not great but pretty good. We asked for separate checks and they split our bill. Solid meh. I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"We had a reservation for 8 and when we showed up they denied the reservation existed and gave us a 25 minute wait."}
{"text":"Everyone that works here is always so upbeat and friendly. Our food is always delicious and correct. The spicy hummus is to die for. The drinks are a little over priced, but oh well. The tables are basically on top of each other. So I hope you like close cozy restaurants. The fake candle lights are perfect for the kids! Keep up the good work"}
{"text":"Service and ambience are good.  We ordered Mixed Grill I.  The chicken kebab is a bit not well cooked.  The Kafta was Ok and them lamb was overcooked.    Rice was a bit dry but overall good quality."}
{"text":"I went here awhile back with my friends and enjoyed the whole experience. I had never tried any middle eastern restaurant before so I wanted to give this one a shot. Its located right in Eton Collection in Woodmere. Parking is not too difficult but expect it to be packed on the weekends. The servers really care about their customers. Loved the atmosphere and will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Taza is a great Mediterranean restaurant!  Before each meal, they give you a basket of small, fresh pitas with za'atar and olive oil. Sometimes, I think I could eat just that as my meal and be very happy!  Everything that I've had here has been fantastic. Some of my other favorites are the lentil soup, fattoush salad, soujouk sausage which are smoky and has a tasty tomato sauce, or the mujadara plate (with rice, lentil, and caramelized onions). If you are there with a few people and want to sample a few different things, I would recommend Vegetarian Feast appetizer (which comes with baba ghanoush, hummus, falafel, and tabouli) or the Taste of Taza appetizer (which comes with shawarma, shish tawook, couscous, salad, hummus, and baba). Honestly, you can't go wrong with anything!  The service is always fast and friendly, and you are in and out quickly. This is a great choice for lunch, dinner, or even take-out. I also like that that they have a patio for when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"Have you ever felt the pang of guilt and self-consciousness for absolutely loving Alladin's? Its as if you are not special enough because you love the chain mass-producing monster instead of working hard to find authenticity of mom and pop's places. Anyway I am as special as they get and I love it. I would buy itchy asymmetrical gloves made by blind nuns instead of Ralph Lauren's but I would still eat Babaganoush from Aladdin's. Go figure. When I was invited to Taza, I thought to myself- here's my chance to redeem myself and fall in love with an authentic cuisine. Enough of Alladin's nonsense I said. And imagine this: food there is identical to Alladin's! Besides that sesame seed dressing with fancy pita and amazingly seasoned French fries, everything else is ABSOLUTELY THE SAME. Only $5-10 more.  Plus romantic atmosphere and bigger plates.  And nicer service. Looking for difference between these two places was like looking for a black cat in a dark room after the cat left. There was none. But after all I don't mind it. I actually love the concept. Have you ever wished for Five Guys burgers being served on porcelain plates in dim-lit  dining room so you will have an excuse to eat them when out instead of some fancy weird fish in sweet marinade? Yep same feeling here. As long as you keep giving me good Middle Eastern food ( fake or not), I am willing to eat anywhere - out of Styrofoam take out box in crowded lunch room or fancy restaurant on Eaton plaza. Because goodness is an independent variable.  It's good no matter where it's served."}
{"text":"Our server was amazing, Manal My daughter and I both have different allergy , she is allergic to sesame seeds and I am allergic to gluten. She reviewed the whole menu for us Food is homemade and healthy I highly recommend this Mediterranean restaurant to everybody"}
{"text":"Taza has some of the absolute best Lebanese food I have ever eaten.  A go-to for me when I travel to this area.  I especially enjoy the Shawarma and Soujouk appetizers.  The staff is always friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Always fast and  friendly service.  Make sure they bring the fresh hott little pita breads....yummmm.the taza chicken salad is very tasty as well as many of the wraps.the hummus is tasty, just be sure to ask for the hot sauce to kick it up."}
{"text":"We didn't dine in, but this was the very first takeout meal we had after relocating to the area. Veggie feast, shish tawook, hummus, cilantro potatoes--everything was amazing. We'll definitely be regular visitors!"}
{"text":"So it's my first time here but I'm in love!!! The food was amazing and the staff is awesome. I will be back every chance I get!!!  I ordered the falafel wrap and it's the best one that I have had in a long time!!! If you like Lebanese food this is the place for you"}
{"text":"We stopped in for a late dinner one Friday night and while the restaurant was not occupied by many other patrons, we still received excellent service and enjoyed our meals.  We got the mixed grill and the appetizer sampler and everything was great. It's just a few bucks more than the popular Aladdin chain of middle eastern restaurants in north east Ohio but the food is far superior."}
{"text":"I was happy when a family friend suggested we go to dinner here on our last trip to Cleveland because I love Mediterranean food and have been wanting to try this restaurant. We decided to sit on the patio, as it was the perfect weather to enjoy dinner outside. The patio is very spacious and most of the tables are in the shade, which is nice, although there are umbrellas for each table, as well.  The menu is a pretty typical Mediterranean one, with everything from salads to schwarma, and falafel to shish kabobs. Their appetizer list was pretty extensive- it was hard not to order one of everything! Being that the menu had too many good choices (and I was indecisive as usual), my mom and I decided to split the Taste of Taza appetizer platter and a bowl of the nine vegetable soup for our meal.  It seemed like it took awhile for the food to arrive, but some warm pita and dipping oil arrived to wet our appetites. There was also a sweeter tasting bread which was quite addictive. The bowl of soup was pretty good. It was full of vegetables in a hearty tomato broth. Next time, I will have to try the tomato couscous soup!  Our appetizer platter finally arrived and WOW was it big. We were glad we decided to split it! The platter included schwarma, shish tawook (chicken), vegetable couscous, Lebanese salata, hummus, and baba. The schwarma had a distinctive spice that I couldn't quite figure out (cinnamon maybe?), but nonetheless it was really good. I loved the chicken and fought my mom for it. The only thing I didn't really care for was the hummus- it just didn't seem to have a lot of flavor. So I ate the most of the baba instead! It was the perfect \"dish\" for the indecisive, and we got to taste a little bit of everything which was awesome. I would definitely order it again!!  Overall, it was a delicious dinner. The prices are more than reasonable for what you would expect at this kind of restaurant. I would definitely recommend coming here when you are in the mood for some Mediterranean...looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Wonderful appetizers! I could go there and eat the fresh hot bread out of the oven any day of the week with some of the various appetizer dips and die happy. Enough garlic in some of them to stun an ox; really wonderful!  The lamb shish kebab was good, but not remarkable, though the garlic sauce was killer.   The fresh pitas come to the table searing hot out of the oven still puffed up like grapefruits. I've been going back and forth as to whether they push this place into five star territory, one more trip and they just might.   Service was prompt and attentive, no problems getting in promptly with a party of eight with a reservation made a couple hours ahead."}
{"text":"There are many options for Lebanese food in the Greater Cleveland area. When something like this happens, what do I do? Ask my Lebanese friends where is the best food. The food is really good at Taza, bring a huge appetite, since you'll want to have a little bit of this and that. The baba, the hummus, the kibbe, the dawali, the garlic labne, you won't want to miss any of those. The lentil soup, to start, especially during the Winter, is also a must. And try the typical Almaza beer.  Maybe the price is a little bit high, just by comparison with some other places with really good Lebanese food, like Nate's. But the setting is nice, so I guess you're contributing for that.  The service has always been great."}
{"text":"So this place is in the ritzy ditzy area of woodmere. Where money is old and jewish for the most part.  The food is good and plentiful. They started us off with hot pita bread and zaitnza3tar, a middle eastern delicacy consisting of olive oil mixed with ground oregano, thyme and sesame seeds. Albert Einstien used to eat that, thats why he was so smart. We ordered the combo appetizers : hummos, falafel, baba ghanouj and what not. I really liked it.The shawarma platter is off the hook. The mix grill is very succulent, tender. And delicious. I would definitely come here again. Why didnt I give this place 5 stars you ask? Well sir, frankly there was a fly harassing me for the first 10 minutes of my meal. Then the waitress got 2 of our 4 orders wrong. Me being the shy introvert type that I am would have never spoken up but I was egged on by my shyer more of an introvert sister.  Party of 4 , 2 appetizers,  soft drinks : $140. ( including tip). Nobody offered to pay. I got jews in my family too."}
{"text":"Great place for middle eastern cuisine. The place is  a casual diner but warm and welcoming. I liked interior and ambience of the place. Also, our waitress- don't remember name, was super nice and helpful. She brought extra bred take to home and that was so sweet of her! I got my favorite salad and my girlfriend had a salmon. We both were satisfied with food quality, service and cozy ambience.  I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The fish (Ahi Tuna) and couscous I had for lunch were absolutely delicious.  The fresh baked pita with seasoned oil whet the appetite excellently, and fresh-brewed mint tea was a good accompaniment.  Service was prompt and fairly attentive.  Well worth a visit."}
{"text":"The Pita they serve is really fresh and good. Tried the appetizer platter and it was tasty. The lamb rolled pita is amazing!"}
{"text":"Pros: Really nice shish tawook, good smokey flavor.  Amazing little pita pockets served with a great olive oil dressing, complimentary. All around good quality.  Stylish atmosphere.  Seems like there are always attractive people in here, at least when I'm there!   Cons: A tad pricier than I'm used to paying for kabobs and hummus, same kind of dishes.  If you want better quality and want to pay, or just want I nicer a atmosphere, this is your spot.  I usually prefer my Mediterranean cheap though, you can get stuff 90 percent as good at alladins for 70 percent the cost and atmosphere, but if you want something nicer, a very good option."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants when I'm in Cleveland!!  The meal starts with bread accompanied by an oil sesame seed mixture. They balance perfectly together!   The hummus is a huge portion. It's delicious and perfect with the bread.   My favorite menu item is the chicken Shish Tawook. It's cooked on a charcoal grill. The vegetables are always perfectly seasoned. The rice is great. But the real winner is the garlic sauce served on the side! It's pure garlic heaven!   I've never had a bad server. The entire staff are friendly and helpful.   If you enjoy Mediterranean food this place is a must try!"}
{"text":"Took my picky eater parents and a fussy toddler on a Sunday evening. Place was busy so I asked to order the child's food right away. The waiter Lanxton, was great. He was attentive and pleasant. The rest of our meal was delayed slightly but otherwise the food was fresh and delicious. Recommend!"}
{"text":"The food is not great here. I had the tour of Taza platter which included chicken that tasted like dried nothingness. The tomato cucumber salad was a bit too onion heavy and did not really pair well with the rest of the dish.  The service was fine, atmosphere is okay but kind of gets ruined by the mediocre food"}
{"text":"Even on one of those days when you are just looking to complain about something, I can bet you would struggle to do so at Taza. The place is a top notch lebanese restaurant with food and ambiance to match, a rare combo actually. In the evening, you can always see the owner walking around and paying close attention to all the tables. The grill is right there where you can see it and the atmosphere is beautiful. I had the lamb kebobs, which were great. I'd like to come again for lunch sometime.  You might also ask, why no 5 stars? The service on my second visit was almost nonexistent during lunch."}
{"text":"This is one of our go to restaurants in the area.  The food is always good and the service is as well.  They usually have whatever seasonal beer glbc is brewing.  We went Friday night and had the potatoes and cilantro appetizer and I had the moujadara for an entree which was enough food to feed 7 armies.  The portions can be a bit outrageous, but the taste is on point.  I've also had the falafel and hummus wrap, the cod, the salmon and the vegetarian appetizer sampler.  All are very good.  My only complaint about the restaurant is that they should change up the menu every once in a while.  We eat here quite frequently and the choices can get kinda boring.  Ask for the hot sauce.  While not very hot at all, it's quite tasty."}
{"text":"Very good food and service. It is great to find a good restaurant that you can rely on. A little expensive but worth it."}
{"text":"Best Lebanese food I've had. Everything was incredibly tasty. The extra bread and sesame oil was also a nice touch and very delicious."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places. Don't miss the baba ganoush. I usually get the vegetarian sampler platter which is plenty of food for two people to make a meal out of. The lentil soup is also phenomenal and I get that all the time too. The atmosphere is beautiful, people are nice and they have a patio."}
{"text":"Nice location and great food. The service was fast and efficient. The Kafta was very good.  We had a very good time.  Would I go back? Yes"}
{"text":"I truly enjoy the food here. It's nice to sit and visit and eat. Great food, good atmosphere."}
{"text":"I feel very fortunate to have this gem in our neighborhood. Excellent food, phenomenal service. It's always a delight to eat there."}
{"text":"I happened to be in the area on business and my associates picked this place.  It was my first experience with Middle Eastern food and I have to say I'm now hooked!  I had the Kafta pita and it was bursting with flavor.  Just the right amount of spices and very fresh.  If I'm in the area again on business I wouldn't hesitate to stop by."}
{"text":"No lie, I don't prefer Mediterranean foods... But I do love hummus! Which is why I chose to go to Taza for Thursday night drinks with friends. However, I'm giving a 3 star rating because of the lackluster taste of everything tried (spicy hummos, tabouli, baklava cheesecake, chocolate bomb) as well as the lack of alcohol in the $4 martinis. Nothing blew my mind and I did not even get a buzz from the drinks. By the end of the night, they had run out of pita for us to take home for the leftovers as well.  In the very least, I had fun with my friends!"}
{"text":"I tried this restaurant on a recent business trip in the area.  I ordered takeout given the lateness of the day and knowing I had a lot more work to complete.  There are quite a lot of run of the mill restaurants around this area and I was looking for something unique and different.  I found it here!  The hostess who took my order was very friendly and attentive and took the time out to explain the menu items where I had questions.  Their turnaround was also very quick.  15 minutes for a takeout order.  My order was accurate and very fresh and tasty.  I wish we had one of these down here in Florida!"}
{"text":"Excellent food.  This restaurant is the more upscale sister of Aladdin's, both owned by the same person.  While Aladdin's is cheaper, the quality of the food at Taza Grill surpasses Aladdin's by leaps and bounds.  I had the chicken Fatteh, a grilled chicken dish with chickpeas, toasted pita, and a tahini-type sauce.  The chicken was very juicy and tender, and even the chickpeas were by far the best I've had, definitely not from a can.  Even their \"bread\"- small pitas served with olives, sesame-oil, and a yogurt sauce, was incredibly good.    They were very accommodating when I made reservations for a large group, even though I had to change the number of people coming a couple times.    Save room for dessert too, because their strawberry cassata cake is so tasty!  Dinner:  Chicken Fatteh $14.95 Strawberry Cassata cake: $5.50"}
{"text":"Deiicous falafel, hommous, baba and tabouleh. Pita not great, no flavour and too doughy"}
{"text":"Excellent food especially the mixed grill platter and the lentil soup and the salad. was delicious. Limited beer selection, good ambiance and they have a nice corner for families with kids."}
{"text":"I spent a year in Cleveland, and Taza was one of the first restaurants I tried...through it all, it remained my favorite.  I am not one to put much stock into atmosphere (unless it is obnoxiously bad), but the open-air design of Taza works very well. You are not sitting on top of other diners so privacy is not an issue, and when the place is full (which was fairly often), the room takes on a warm, family-type vibe. Outdoor seating is available, too (in season, of course). Everyone from the host to the servers were extremely friendly, and it wasn't long until we had our \"regular\" table and server every time we went.  Of course, none of this matters if the food is not up to par, and thankfully it is fantastic. Soups and appetizers are flavorful and generous (I'm not sure how I lived this long without kibbe), and the main dinner entrees offer more than enough food. I was never once let down by either the fresness or quality, and I came here once a week, at a minimum. If you have never tried Lebanese food, you are missing out...a new world of flavor awaits you. Fish, meat, vegetables...you can't lose. Specialty drinks are offered, as well as the \"normal\" stuff from the full bar. One downside...the blender at the bar can be a bit noisy, as there is nothing but a few feet of air between it and the tables. A minor quibble but worth pointing out.  As another poster mentioned, you will be thirsty during your meal. The open fire no doubt contributes, and I imagine the spices in the dishes may factor in as well. Thankfully, your glass will never be empty for very long.  Taza will be sorely missed now that I have left Cleveland, and should I ever return to the area, it will be my first stop. You can get Lebanese food cheaper elsewhere, but if you want the \"full package\", this is it."}
{"text":"Yum!  Shwarma salad was perfect, service was great, owner showed us pictures of his son who had just been drafted to play college ball to entertain my 8 year old while we waited for a table.  Next time I am in Cleveland I am there.  Interior is nice and prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"I love middle eastern food, so I knew this was a must stop when driving past. First, previous reviewers mention the noise level in this place and they aren't wrong. It is very very noisy and at times difficult to hear your dining partner. There was a keyboard player when we were there however which may have contributed to the noise.  The food was just ok. We started out with one of the appetizer samplers (with meat) and it was awesome. We also got a side of falafel that was somewhat dry. If we had just stuck with the appetizer plate that would have been enough because there is a ton of food on that plate. For my entree I got the mixed grill and OMG that rice. The rice comes with cinnamon which seems like an odd choice at first but is so delicious. The grilled vegetables were also pretty great. The meat however, was not. My chicken was undercooked...which if that's ever happened to you, you know how gross it is. The lamb was just ok, a little on the dry side, and the kafta was decent as well.  The service was great, as my coworker and I were slurping down sodas like there was no tomorrow and the waiter was on top of filling them as soon as they were empty. The food also came out fairly quickly, which I appreciate (but thinking back on it, should have clued me in that my chicken would be undercooked)."}
{"text":"Cold hummus after waitress said it was served warm there is the only complaint I have.  The food and service were otherwise very good.  It is much like Aladdin's and I understand that is because they are owned by same owners.  :)"}
{"text":"Very accommodating staff.  This place is popular with families.  The portions are huge and the salads fresh.  The beef shwarma was cooked through a little more than I'd like but the pita was soft and fluffy and my cocktail, stiff."}
{"text":"I love this place. The salads are excellent and the Tour of Lebanon plate is absolutely delicious. It's obvious the amount of time and attention that's put into the menu, and the staff is lovely. The only thing I don't like is how loud it gets at lunchtime. But that won't deter me from going back!  I look forwand to it!"}
{"text":"Update:  Taza has greatly improved since my last visit.  We had dinner with friends on Friday night, and the food was amazing.  The server was very nice and speedy.  The shishtawook, grilled chicken strips and wraps were delicious and fresh.  Hummus wasn't as flavorful as I would have liked, but still good.  All the vegetables seemed freshly cut and grilled, on the spot; you could really tell with the al dente-ish crunch.  The patio seats were very enjoyable.  We will return!!! Downsides: Parking lot is a mess PLEASE get pita bread; while the other bread is tasty, it isn't as complementary I the dishes"}
{"text":"The food here was excellent. This was my first time here and I will definitely be returning hopefully soon.  Sat outside, the outside area and inside are both very nice. The waiter was amazing and the service was excellent as well other than being seated in which the hostess didn't seem too happy or in a good mood but that's my only complaint! I recommend trying this place out!"}
{"text":"Taza was EXCELLENT!  The baba, hummus, and falafel were very good.  Dined outside and the area was very clean and comfortable.  The service was quick and waiters were very friendly.  Entrées from the grill were amazing.  Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"The service here is so good and fast. My food arrived in less than 5 minutes and their hummus was fantastic. I highly recommend coming here for food. I tried the Hummos Chicken and loved it."}
{"text":"My favorite place to visit when I come home! I tell everyone in California that this is some of the best lebanese food you can get, and nothing out-of-state has compared. The bread they serve with their hummus is fantastic, and the quality of their meat is amazing.   Personally, I love their beef shawarma rolled, but almost everything they serve is amazing.I also love their fries. This my pick for any family dinner, birthday party, etc."}
{"text":"I went to this location for a company dinner to welcome a couple consultants and to honor a summer intern.  The Food:  My knowledge of lebanese food is limited.  Some things, such as babah, I straight up did not like.  Due to my limited knowledge I dont know if it was made badly or if I simply just dont like it but I tend to think it is the latter.  However, the hummus, falafel and lamb swish were delicious.  But really the best thing is that pillowly pita bread.  The best bread I have had in a long time.  Try the baklava cheesecake......it's delicious and I don't like baklava.   The Service:  The waiter was attentive, knowledgeable and attractive.  He offered to package my leftovers for me.  I love when this service is provided.  All in all I have a great experience and would return again.  Tip:  Ask for some pillowly pita bread (TAZA bread) to go.  They will bring a brown bag with at least three hot out the oven pieces to take home."}
{"text":"Found this spot on Yelp (of course) and the 4 star rating was right on point. The food was excellent, it had great service and nice atmosphere. I just think they need to step it up a notch in the drink area.  If you order a cocktail, just keep it simple with wine, the mixed drinks were just ok. Otherwise, we loved it and will come back."}
{"text":"Just had the chance to stop by one of my favorite Grills in the Beachwood area.  Taza's is amazing,  The pita is freshly made and the Zatar they bring with it is sooooo YUMMY!  The service is good and fast.  We ate outside and it was so pleasant and enjoyable.    The only negative thing I'd have to say is get a better tea.  I love a good black tea and when I go to a very nice place to eat, which I think Taza is, I expect a better quality tea then what I had.    If you are in the area.. stop by, Lunch is amazing.  My favorite is the lamb plate.  Lamb with rice.  WOW.  I'm a lamb fan when it is cooked properly.    It's also in a lovely shopping area and if you go next door to Penzey's you can walk right inside to the mall that is connected to all the stores you see on the outside.    ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Everything but the hummus was very good.  Unfortunately, Lebanese food kind of requires good hummus.  It just had an iron-like aftertaste."}
{"text":"Yes, the food is largely similar to Aladdin's Eatery. But, if you try the mezza, you will realize why this place is worth the price. Especially the jibneh. My family wants to eat here every time they visit."}
{"text":"This has the feel of a family spot -- young women (daughters?) helping out by bussing tables, seating customers or delivering plates -- but actually this is part of an empire of a Lebanese entrepreneur. Even so, the food was fabulous, the waitress highly personable and the spinach had such a mix of wonderful flavors that she gave us the recipe."}
{"text":"I was incredibly disappointed in our service tonight. Ruben was our server and it took a solid five-ten minutes for him to come to our table and greet us.  We received our appetizer quickly, through not from Ruben.  We ordered the vegetarian platter I don't remember exactly what it was called but I thought it was a great value for 16 dollars.  We throughly enjoyed that along with the warm pita bread.  We ordered the speciality salads for our entrees.  The table behind us had more people, sat down after us and received and ate their entire meal before Ruben came around to tell us our salads would be right out.  At this point we just asked for them to go.  The salad has three very small pieces of chicken on it.  Like I said, incredibly disappointed in the service and the pathetic salads we were sent home with. Hopefully Ruben was just having a bad night.  But we probably will not be returning to see if another night is better."}
{"text":"Their complimentary pita is simply amazing. Chicken Kafta plate and lentil soup are a must try."}
{"text":"I ordered the mixed grill and lentil soup. The rice pilaf was delicious and the garlic sauce out of this world. I was however very disappointed with the dried out chicken kabob and lamb kabob. I asked for medium and received well done lamb kabob. A huge no no.  The customer service was excellent. Both greeter and bar tender very informative and customer focused."}
{"text":"It was the positive yelp reviews that brought me to this location. That and the Kiwanis district convention which is being held at the Doubletree in Beachwood this year. The restaurant is less than a mile from the Doubletree and sounded like a great opportunity to have some Lebanese food, something that is available only on a limited basis in Alliance. I had the Taste of Taza and didn't bother to take a photo since there's already a photo or two on this site. Super fresh salad, a bit of hummus and baba, chicken with couscous, and a savory beef dish covered with tahini salad graced the plate.  My serving was just as gorgeous as the photos, the server just as attentive, and the taste was just as amazingly fresh and delicious. I had a top shelf beverage to start off and still got out the door for $27 including the tip."}
{"text":"Taza's Phoenician Salad with Grilled Chicken is one of my favorite salads in the world. I usually get take-out for lunch when in the area and it is unbeatable. The dressing is this amazing blend of oil and herbs that really compliments the fresh crispness of the salad and chicken marinade. When you do dine in they give you this awesome herb oil and pita to dip in it. It's so good and very addicting. The hummus is great as well. I get it almost every time. I highly recommend giving it a try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Food was good, but overall service was poor. Did not keep reserved table ready for large group, and then put us in a cramped spot that couldn't properly accommodate us. I guess they are just not equipped to handle any group greater than 4. Server seemed harried and required multiple reminders for simple requests."}
{"text":"This is a favorite stop when I want something a little different. Fresh warm pita awaits you and the service is always great. (Even at closing) The Shawarma Plate is my choice and it is bery satisfying. You can not go wrong withbthis choice."}
{"text":"This restaurant is owned by the same family that has the Aladdin's restaurants. That being said, I have always loved Aladdin's and therefore love Taza. The only real difference is that you pay more at Taza because it feels like a nicer restaurant and is in the more affluent area."}
{"text":"I ate here a few years ago and had a decent experience, however after this evening's experience I definitely won't be returning.    The food, while moderately priced, was mediocre at best.  My friend's salad with grilled chicken was terrible.    Our waiter provided us with inexcusably bad service.  After we were seated he brought menus and water straight away, pressured us to order, and when we said we needed just one minute to decide, he us for at least ten and avoided when we tried to catch his eye across the patio, something that continued to happen throughout the evening.  When I ordered I asked him to clarify the price on the different shish kabobs, I thought I'd chosen one that cost $12.95.  Later when the check arrived, it had magically turned into a dish costing $16.95.  When I politely asked about the price he rudely retorted, \"no, you're wrong,\" and looked at me like I was insane for even asking about it.  A simple apology would have been all it took to fix the situation.    Needlessly to say, we won't be returning.    Save your money!  Go to B-Spot or Paladar which are both in the same mall."}
{"text":"I have always had a great experience at Taza. From the moment of being seated and they bring out the fresh oven baked pitas and zatar I started to realize this place is amazing. Personally I could go there just to eat their freshly made pitas, but I have a feeling that this would be frowned upon so I order more food, and it is definitely worth it. The spicy hummus is amazing, although not conventionally spicy as one might think. It has more of a tang to it, that makes it interesting! My two favorite main courses to get there are the Kabob plate, or the chicken shistawook roll-I usually choose between deciding if I am in the mood for rice or a sandwich. Their garlic sauce and their tahini are both amazing so I always order both sauces. Also they make a very good turkish coffee, which is hard to find! Service is always on point and I have never left unsatisfied. Honestly this is one of the most consistent restaurants that never disappoints and will leave you still talking about the food every time you leave! I cannot say enough good things about this place."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a middle eastern breakfast or brunch then this place got it all for you. Their fatteh and cheese and zaatar pie are to die for   But their dinner options are limited and not so encouraging"}
{"text":"Hmmmm Taza...Undecided on if I will go back to this restaurant to sit and eat. I have to say the food was great, but the service wasn't the best and noise was a little much for me to enjoy dinner and conversation.  I went with some friends to Taza, and being Eaton the restaurant and plaza was absolutely packed. After finding a spot we waited about 30 minutes to sit down which gave me time to scope out the restaurant. The host took down our number so we could walk around Eton - I appreciate when restaurants do this.  The restaurant was small, tables were close together, and it was very noisy. Once seated we had fairly fast service, but our waiter seemed like he had too many tables to give us good service (not his fault). He forgot a few things, but I could see he was running non-stop to take care of his customers. Also there were a number of children running around, which I don't mind but I can see it being an issue for other guests. We had more than one \"visit\" at our table...  We started with hummus and got hot sauce on the side. I REALLY enjoyed their hot sauce, used it for my meal as well. I got the wrap with beef and grilled vegetables for my dinner. All was delicious and they had large portions for food. The main entrees were definitely were more then enough food to take home for a second meal.  Overall I would say 4-5 starts for food, but the experience brought down the rating to 3 (because I can't give 3.5). I will takeout for dinner here for sure, but probably won't dine in again unless my friends are picking the location."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch on a weekday.  Atmosphere is nice and the restaurant was crowded. We all had shish kabobs.  Good quality food, but my chicken was dry.  Rice was good.  Service was slow...not sure if this was due to the shish kabobs or the crowd, but will not go here again when in a hurry. I do plan on going back to try some of their other Lebanese/Mediterranean offerings."}
{"text":"This is Aladdin's all dressed up and and ready to impress.  Chalk that up to common ownership.  However, Taza is definitely not a great fast food place-- it's a great place for a fabulous lunch.  THE FOOD:  To start the waitress brought us a plate of zahtar, sumac and sesame seed mixed with olive oil and a little basket, covered in a napkin.  I opened the little basket and what to my wondering eyes should appear?  Four miniture pita, still hot, my dear. Sorry, I was Christmas shopping.  This is not the very flat pita you get at Aladdin's or Jasmine's bakery for shwarma-- it is ever so slightly breadier (not a bun, though like Father Sam's).  It definitely shows the French influence on Lebanese cuisine.  Since we ordered hummous as an appetizer, we got a batch straight out of the oven.  The hummous was smooth, dense and creamy.    My daughter's mujedrah (Yes, I have 6 year old who orders mujedrah-- she was not interested in the very nice children's menu.) was not mushy in the least, and well seasoned with onion and cinnamon.  The Lebanese salata on top -- tomatoes and cucumbers seasoned with sumac dressing-- was a bright counterpoint to the smokiness of the lenitls.  And yes, they have those awesome banana-honey smoothies.     My shwarma was divine-- a perfect blend  of finely shreaded meat, allspice, cinnamon and garlic.  My only complaint is that it was a little oily-- though not enough to stop me from cleaning my plate.  I asked for bulgur pilaf instead of fries.  Was that a good choice!!!  The pilaf was at once smokey, complex, lightly spiced and lightly buttery.  It was spiked with chick peas and carrots.  Lordy!  Mon cher's shish tawook was well marinated and grilled so that it was nicely charred on the outside and juicy on the inside.  THE ATMOSPHERE:  It is a very pretty space-- exotic without being kitschy.  It is a soaring space, decorated in shades of rich amber and golden glass.  There are lush curtains and ancient looking vases.  The open kitchen lends an air of comfort and coziness to the place.  THE SERVICE:  Our waitress was very sweet and helpful, paying special attention to my daughter to make sure she had what she needed.   (It wouldn't be a Lebanese restaurant if they did not welcome children with open arms.)  She even snagged some fresh pita as it came out of the oven for us!  The owner was gracious and charming.   NB:  I have only been here once for lunch."}
{"text":"I met a colleague here for lunch and the joint was jumping at 11:40am on a Wednesday.  Be forewarned.  I really enjoyed this place.  The ambience is laid back and classy without trying too hard - very natural.  There's a ton of seating, and we got a two-top near the front.  Out waiter materialized almost instantly, and maintained a great balance of attentiveness throughout our meal.  Great!  My lunch was falafel - seemed like a standard and a good way to \"rate\" a lebanese place.  They serve it as four large balls on a nice salad.  The salad was really good, not your normal bag-o-salad-greens.  The falafel was very tasty, too.  Not amazing but definitely worth it.  I ate it all and was very satisfied.  It was a $12 lunch (I has an Arnold Palmer with my meal).  Not cheap but not the most I've ever paid for lunch.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Taza is an upscale Mediterranean eatery that is a very cool experience. When I say upscale I don't mean shirt and tie, but you might want to put on a collared shirt for this one. Just my opinion. It's 3 star dining which for me means more than Applebee's but less than Flemings steak house.  We had lunch there today after a long time away and it was fantastic. We sat at the bar, I had Turkish coffee (which is like chewing on a coffee bean) and the wrapped sandwiches that come with fries. You must try the Hummus plates, and hummus appetizers, our favor is the spicy hummus and Diwali!    They have two location that I know of, downtown Cleveland and Woodmere and they are both really cool nice places to dine and hang out. This place is a must try if you enjoy Mediterranean food. GO...go now!"}
{"text":"Great food great service. Very nice restaurant. They even have little outside patio . Large bar to. Been here many times always great."}
{"text":"I have been to this location a few times. It is located inside the Eton Plaza. I went to this place because I was shopping around and wanted a bite to eat. I have never really had lebanese/middle eastern food before. I went on a sunday for lunch and it wasn't very busy at all. I got seated to a booth. I ordered the spicy hummus and lentil soup with chicken. The hummus comes with pita bread which is one of the most delicious pita bread I have ever had. It came out in a bread basket and it was pipping hot and delicious. The spicy hummus was delicious but not spicy at all. My server did give me their in house hot sauce and one of the best hot sauce I have had. It is not spicy but very flavorful. The lentil soup is one of my favorite especially in a cold wintery days like in Cleveland. BEWARE not to eat too much pita bread because you might get full before you even get your entree :)! For entree i ordered Shish Tawook Chicken. It came with rice and grilled vegetables. The food is very delicious. The service is very good. The atmosphere is very casual and relaxing. Overall one of my favorite places to eat for lebanese/middle eastern food."}
{"text":"This place is a must for my mother and I when we are on the east side. I feel like this is the one place where we get a great dining experience everytime we go. I have to say I usually get the tuna steak there because its seasoned so well and they add some pesto sauce on the side which is phenomenal. They also serve it with a tomato couscous salad which I feel like I could go on a carb overload eating. Everything I've had from the chicken shwarma to the tabboleh to the grilled lamb is all cooked with such perfect flavoring and is delicious. I would recommend starting off with the lamb and trying something new each time."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch.  Large portion. Server could of been more attentive, but the place was packed. My wife is a huge fan, but I'm a burger and beer guy"}
{"text":"My husband and I went today for lunch with two friends of ours after church. Upon first entering, we all noticed the decor - very elegant and exotic with lots of bronze and dark wood & beautiful lighting. Oddly enough, the two guys ended up getting the same thing and so did the two girls. The guys got the lamb shish kabobs (spelling?) and us women got the 'hummos platter with chicken.' The lamb was amazing.. Flavorful and tender (I had a bite of my hubby's) And the guys were very happy!(neither one had leftovers). While both of us girls love hummus, neither if us expected it t be as good as it was. The hummus was as delicious and creamy, the chicken was incredibly tender and juicy and the bread it was served with (regular thin pita bread and also a fluffier version of the bread). We were surprised at how good it was and also how filling it was (they gave us a lot, we both took half home). Would def go back ANC recommend to others!"}
{"text":"I can not say enough fantastic things about this place.  It was hubby and I's first time and we were promptly seated by the hostess and very nicely greeted by our waitress.  After being given menu's, I explained that it was our first time here and our waitress was kind and patient as she explained the menu, told us what they were famous for and answered all of our questions after giving us time to look over the menu!  I LOVE THAT!  We tried the stuffed grape leaves as an appetizer and OH BOY!  My mouth is watering just remembering how great it was!  I ordered the beef and lamb Kafka as my main lunch and LOVED the flavor so much.  When mixed with the cucumber sauce and rice, it really made the flavors pop in your mouth.  Everything came out hot and steamy, and smelled fantastic.  Art on a plate and in your mouth!  If I didn't live so far away, I would come here all the time!  Parking is a bit of a pain as it is located in a busy place but worth it!"}
{"text":"Always a good experience when we are shopping at Eton.  Not so much of a destination, but we are lucky that we have it a few blocks away and go so often!  Great garlic and hot sauce, rice is amazing and the pickled turnups and pickles are my favorites.  Depends on the day- sometime they will give you extra if you ask for just fifty cents.  Hummus is great with added garlic and hot sauce.  Love the lamb (med rare) dish and wrap and the rice is great!  Recommend for a great lunch or early dinner!"}
{"text":"More gluten free choices are needed for side dishes. The rice contains gluten (Aladdin's doesn't, BTW), and all the server would substitute is more vegetables, and refused to substitute potatoes. I had to order two appetizers to end up with Shawarma and potatoes."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I finally got to Taza!  It's been on my to-do list for some time, but for whatever reason just didn't get around to it!  We arrived to a full restaurant at 6 pm on a Saturday. Luckily we had reservations and were promptly seated. Matthew took care of our table.  He was FANTASTIC!  After introducing himself he apologized for our wait and said he would be right back to take our drink orders. (Apology unnecessary!  He didn't leave us waiting at all!) My husband and I ordered a couple Old Fashioned from the drink menu. They arrived quickly and they were deliciously strong!  (So delicious I ordered another after dinner!) We started with apps. Our table shared an order of the Lebanese Jibneh (sautéed cheese w/pomegranate sauce) and an order of dawali (stuffed grape leaves). Wow!  Perfection all around!  The pomegranate sauce on the cheese was a tasty addition!  The grape leaves had the bright, tangy flavor I love so much!  They were wonderfully tender, as well!  For my entreé I chose the Shish Lamb while my husband opted for the Mixed Grill. My Shish Lamb was fantastic! Tender and flavorful!  The cinnamon on the accompanying rice was a tasty surprise! The tahini was delicious and the garlic sauce?!???  WOW!  This stuff will truly keep the vampires away!  My husband seemed to enjoy his Mixed Grill too!  He didn't share with me so I can't give you a first-hand opinion though! My only complaint was how tight the tables in our section were. We were in the corner across from the bar, by the front windows. EVERY time someone walked by they bumped my chair. Every. Single. Time. I've read the reviews complaining about the noise level, and I must agree with that tidbit. It seemed to be louder in the main dining room than in our corner though. So the trade-off for good conversation is that you get your chair bumped, I guess! Bottom line, I won't let those two drawbacks keep me away. Good drinks, fantastic service, and delicious food far outweigh the missteps!"}
{"text":"A Little background on Taza for those who don't know is that it is owned by the same people who own Aladdin's which helps to explain many of the similarities in the menu.  The main differences in my mind are the portions and the dress.  While you can certainly wear jeans to Taza it is made out to be a fancier place, at least when compared to Aladdin's.  The portions are also much bigger.  The menu sizes are both very large which is good and bad depending on your perspective.  I personally enjoy having plenty to pick from even if it makes choosing difficult.  I personally enjoy the pita bread they serve at Taza its more fluffy than the normal flat pita bread you get at aladdin's.  It also comes out nice and warm.  It is served with some sort of olive oil and spice mix that I enjoyed not really sure what it was though.  I have been to Taza a half dozen times or so but I'll tell you about my most recent experience in February.  I had the Phoenician Salad which was a mixed greens salad with walnuts, dried cranberries, a basalmic vinegarette dressing and a crumbled cheese somewhat similar to blue cheese.  It was excellent, I almost choose the Cedars Salad a.k.a \"Caesar\" but I'm glad I tried this one it was excellent.  The Hummos was excellent as well for an appitzers its served with a few whole chickpeas on the top with some olive oil. Found it to be very tasty as well and I'm not the biggest fan of hummos.  For dinner I had the Mixed Grill which is Beef Kafta (Seasoned ground beef and herbs formed into sausage like roll), Shish Tawook Chicken (Marinated Grilled Chicken Kaboobs), and Grilled Lamb.  Everything was very juicy and tender with plenty of flavor and I throughly enjoyed both the tahini sauce adn especially the garlic sauce for dipping the meats in.  Just keep in mind, the garlic sauce is super tasty but super strong, if you have any plans to get anywhere close to a member of the opposite sex you might want to think twice before indulging in the garlic sauce.  So I've been to Taza about a half dozen times and this particular time is probably the first i'd give it a 5 star rating.  The others earned it a solid 4 but not quite top shelf."}
{"text":"It is like a better Aladdin's but also higher priced. To start we got Lebanese Jibneh, which is fresh cheese with pomegranate sauce. It's supposed to be grilled but it came out cold and no sign of grill at all. The pomegranate sauce tasted like balsamic vinegar. Don't get me wrong, it was still good, but just different than what I was expecting, especially on the grilled part. I split the mixed grill which was perfect for two and the meat was cooked well. I recommend the garlic sauce (comes on the side) but beware a LOT of garlic. We kept asking for sides of the fresh warm bread on the side to eat our meal, glad to see it wasn't store bought pita.  A place that I can count on for a solid meal and nice atmosphere but not anything outstanding."}
{"text":"Love this place-- probably here every two weeks. Their hot homemade pita bread is incredible and we order the hummus and baba every time. Generous portions so we always have some to take home. Don't forget to ask for their hot sauce! Salads, shawarma, and rice are other highlights. Service is always top notch and the kitchen is fast."}
{"text":"Great food, service, and atmosphere. Love the fresh baked Pita bread and olive oil\zatar dipping sauce. Their babaganosh is very tasty. The falafel is the best I have had. It is a bit pricey for dinner."}
