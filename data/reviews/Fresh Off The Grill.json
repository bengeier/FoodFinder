{"text":"Awesome burgers.best fish sandwich around. Casual atmosphere.friendly staff"}
{"text":"Good food at good prices. 

Make sure you call your order in ahead of time if you know you're going to be ordering during the busy hours (lunch/dinner rush) as there isn't much room inside to be waiting around for your order."}
{"text":"You want a good burger and fries that tastes like it's supposed to? Come here! Fries are only ok but the burger definitely makes up for it! Noms!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. I go to here all the time during my lunch break. It is fast and easy. It taste like it is cooked fresh, always very juicy."}
{"text":"Yum! We love stopping by here & getting a burger or the fish sandwich. The new one off Harris Rd is yummy too."}
{"text":"We visited Fresh off the Grill with a coupon from the Entertainment Book.  Made several attempts to this location , only to find it closed on days that it should have been open according to hours posted on door.  Not sure why that was.  The food was marginal at best.  the fries were overcooked and tasted like the oil they were fried in needed to be changed a long time ago :-(  The girls that were working the counter were unprofessional.  Just standing around, texting, etc.  Complaining about having to work on race weekend.  Burger wasn't bad, but nothing to write home about and certainly won't make the cut for me to return at menu full price without coupon,"}
{"text":"I get the burger special every Tuesday can you say amazing! Its not greasy its just prefect. I always use the drive thru which moves pretty fast. This places stays busy but they always have my order ready when I arrive."}
{"text":"Food is alright but the service was unsatisfactory. I felt rushed while ordering, I guess it's because it wasn't obvious that I haven't dined here before. The girl that the register was getting an attitude because I didn't know that I got sides with my tenders and didn't want any sides, I didn't mind paying full price and not ordering any sides (I didn't want to order food that I wasn't going to eat). I practically had my change thrown in my hand."}
{"text":"We saw some positive reviews for this little place and decided to try our luck at a previously unattended restaurant, BIG MISTAKE.  I don't know what the people that gave this place any type of positive reviews but it was terrible.  My 8 year old took one bite of the hotdog and said, \"this is terrible\".  I had to take him to McDonald's after we left this place.  He didn't even want to finish his Pepsi at this place it was so bad.  I just don't understand how bad food has to be at other places for people to give this joint a positive review.  Get out and try some other places people, your mouth and stomach will thank you.  If you see this place, keep on going."}
{"text":"Another little gem in our area.
The new buffalo chicken philly is the BEST around."}
{"text":"Great fresh food!  Large menu makes it hard to choose. Desserts look amazing!  Enjoyed the chicken salad sandwich. Lots of white meat chicken. Super good!"}
{"text":"I so wish I liked this place but the times I've been have not been good.  The food isn't bad at all but the lack of friendliness from the order takers is bad.  So bad that I don't want to go in there.  I'm not sure if these girls are related to the owner, but I would have to think so if they are allowed to work there.  If the customer service improved, I would be a frequent customer."}
{"text":"I am so glad a place like this exists in Concord.

Their burgers are juicy and their fries are delicious.  You can get in and out of here around lunchtime pretty easily but beware, everyone else knows about this place too so there will be a crowd."}
{"text":"Great mom and pop type burger place! The chicken philly is amazing a d the staff is so nice."}
{"text":"I eat here every now and again since they have opened. Nothing special about this place other than when you need lunch quick fast and in a hurry they will do in a pinch. The blackened chicken salad is my favorite by far. Today I had the rib eye steak sandwich. Which was decent it did the trick. My opinion is to go in and order your food! The last time I ordered over the phone the girl had no idea what she was doing and asked me what I wanted in the salad when I said how it comes, she said do you want everything on it and I said yes everything that should be on it. Needless to say when I went there to pick it up the same girl was more interested in her IPhone to realize I was standing there. No big deal right?! Well when I got back to work I opened the box my salad came in and she had put literally half of a tomato not even cut up on it and pickles????!!!!!! Really who the hell puts pickles on a frigin salad?? Needless to say I was slightly disappointed in that. So like I said it's decent food at a decent price nothing more nothing less."}
{"text":"Horrible.  Staff was aloof they charge extra for everything and are very slow. It was also very hot in there.  Don't recommend going"}
{"text":"I stopped in and ordered the Rueben sandwich with a side salad. Great Reuben sandwich , and very fresh salad, very clean and great service ! Thx
I will be returning !"}
{"text":"Food has been good every time I have been. Burgers are good. This one is better than the one at the Food Lion down the road on Poplar Tent."}
{"text":"Great Food! Most anything you could want. Friendly service. Eat here every chance I get."}
{"text":"Very good burgers, right up there with the best in Concord.  So far the best French fries I have had.  Will be back."}
{"text":"I used to go here at least twice a week. Their blackened grilled chicken salad was always tantalizing. The tuna salad sandwich was another favorite of mine and the level of customer service was excellent. They were always cordial and engaging with all of their guests. I miss having them at this location because the one in Concord is not as enticing."}
{"text":"It is ok. Nothing will wow you. Frozen food fried, decent burgers and ok chicken.  It is good for quick lunch and better than subway."}
{"text":"Probably my mistake ordering a blackened chicken sandwich at a place known for burgers, but...

Dry, overcooked chicken breast with blackening spice sprinkled on AFTER cooking.  I might try them again if I'm in the mood for a burger, but I'll pass on the chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"Good service good food, satisfied my wings and fries craving  wings could have been a little wetter but other than that great food!"}
{"text":"Let me get to the point...Awesome Patty Melt, my wife loved the mushroom and swiss burger, french fries and onion rings hot and crispy.  Fast friendly service.  Fantastic place for a delicious, quick lunch.....we will be back."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant several times over the past year and decided that it was time to write a review. Here are my observations:

1. The food is great. I have had several items from the menu and never been disappointed with food quality.

2. The Concord location is cozy and clean (even the bathroom.) This place fills up quick because it is popular amongst locals.

3. Contrary to some of the other reviews that I read, I have never had any issues with customer service (with any person) at least not at the Concord location. In fact, during our last visit my wife and I joked and talked with the two girls working the register. They refilled our drinks without having to be asked to do so (which is one way that I gauge customer service at restaurants.

4. If you go there during the week and don't plan to eat in, call in your order and they will have it ready for you at their drive-thru."}
{"text":"the ladies that took my order were nice. i ordered a blackened chicken sandwich and side salad with two ranches. i got one ranch, and the side salad was sooo basic. the blackened chicken was good, but the bacon i ordered on my sandwich was all fat pretty much. i had forgot to order cheese on my sandwich so i asked the ladies for a piece of cheese. they rang me up for it (which i understand) then it took literally 10 minutes for them to hand me the cheese. my food was cold by the time i got the cheese so i just didn't use it. my sandwich came in  a paper basket and i kept getting paper in my mouth cause it was wet from my sandwich. the lady checked on us once to ask if we want refills but that was when we were done eating. i'm really not trying to sound too rude, this place has a lot of potential - step up your flavor in the food and try a little harder. or hire someone else to help out."}
{"text":"Very mediocre food if you ask me. I've tried to love this place but nothing I've tried has been that good to me. I go there just because it's close and gets the job done. Lot of things were kinda dry. I do love their grilled chicken salad! And the customer service is really good. Very nice people working here."}
{"text":"Good food.  Fair price.

I ordered a sandwich, which was good.  It was a very sizable portion.

The price were reasonable, but I was not blown away by the value.

They have a staff member walking around refilling drinks, which is very nice.

However, The staff taking orders was busy chatting and gave the impression that all the people ordering food were bothering them.  They were not rude, just seemed distracted.  No huge deal but worth mentioning."}
{"text":"Always great food. They never disapoint!! Buffalo chicken tenders are great and can't go wrong with their juicy burgers"}
{"text":"Great Carolina bacon cheeseburger
Real beef
Looked at reviews 
Slow - yea had to cook it 
One lady compiling she only got one ranch not two-wow
I had no problems"}
{"text":"Service was excellent and food was Fresh, Fast, & Delicious! Yummy burger and fries and a great value for a dine-in \"fast-casual\" experience. Employees made us feel welcome. They participate in a local business rewards program which rewards you with free menu items after a certain number of visits/orders. This is easily accessed on a handy dandy tablet near the register. Would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"How had I not tried this place sooner? It was delicious! The burgers taste fresh and they are a decent size. The only complaint is the chili for the hotdog, it wasn't more like crumbled beef. Had no sauce at all. However the rest of the meal was good. We will be back!"}
{"text":"The best burger and wing joint in the area. The wings are my personal favorite so that's what I'll focus on. I think they don't get enough recognition! They're always crispy and moist! And their sauce is just what I want in a wing sauce. Good heat, good coverage, good flavor. The rest of the menu is typical burger and sandwich joint fare. Nothing out of the ordinary but they always come through with good consistency. I wish they had longer Sunday hours but I respect them for taking some time off. Worth stopping in if you haven't tried them before."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here a few weeks ago.  The inside is nothing special seven or eight tables.  I had the BLT with a side of cole slaw it was pretty good.  My wife has a cheese burger with fried zucchini.  The top bun was stale and the bottom bun was wet, plus her fried zucchini was only halfway cooked with the battering or dough still raw.  Probably would not go here again. This place is okay if you just need to have some calories.  Would not recommend."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Fresh Off The Grill!  I usually have the double cheeseburger with fries.  Dad and I eat here because it is fast and gets us back on the job quickly."}
{"text":"I like to give my business to small businesses. So I guess I expected a little bit more than a mediocre dry burger, burnt crinkle fries from the freezer and 2 sad strips of bacon. The sweet tea was decent.. this for $12.80. Cannot comment on the cupcake, as it is from a bakery. This place offers a to-go window... just be sure to call in your order beforehand. I'll pay half the price at the chain up the street next time."}
{"text":"Meh, it's good. But not that good. Burgers are of better quality than the fast food joints, but I'd much rather go to cookout"}
{"text":"Off the Grill is a wonderful mom and pop burger joint! Their burgers are so fresh and tasty! Service was excellent! A young lady came a few times to make sure we didn't need more drink or anything else! I recommend if you are in the area, giving it a try!"}
{"text":"Great burger. Not processed or greasy. Good flavor, fresh toppings! They really do make good burgers. Other things on the menu are good too.  Chicken was excellent to. Not dry. I would recommend it!!"}
{"text":"If you want hand-pattied burgers instead of the typical tasteless fast food burger, give Fresh Off the Grill a try. Lot of variety and some damn yummy burgers. If you are in the mood for some major beef flavor, and a sucker for novelties, try the Big Daddy burger. It is H-U-G-E and juicy.

The establishment is a little small and thankfully they have a drive thru pick-up window for to-go orders. I recommend this place to all who crave a beefy hamburger. It is little gem in the Concord/Poplar Tent area."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great people. It's small inside but they have a drive thru and you can order ahead of time."}
{"text":"We stopped in here today after my daughters college graduation, her choice. We were looking for a good, fairly quick stop before getting on the road for another hour or so drive. Quick is exactly what we got.
I ordered the mushroom and Swiss burger with fries and a water. My wife and daughter got the Turkey club with fries and we all got waters. Our orders were at the table about 2 minutes after we sat down. Both the girls agreed that the club was great with the perfect amount of everything. We all said the fries were good and the seasoned salt was at a perfect consistency and they were cooked correctly. I personally hate under cooked or over cooked fries. 
As for my burger, it was good but I had to add ketchup because it was a little dry. Most Mushroom and Swiss burgers have the mushrooms in some type of gravy or sauce or something but these were just heated mushrooms. It was still delicious and I ate every least crumb.
We will definitely return and if you haven't eaten here, I recommend you try it."}
{"text":"Tried this place once and wasn't too impressed. They were very busy on a Sunday morning so my expectations were high. 

I ordered the Philly cheesesteak sub. Being born in Philly and having lived there I'm kinda a tough critic but this was just OK, nothing special. Firehouse Subs steak and cheese sub blows this away. Fries were just meh. Probably won't be back with better restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a late lunch and there were only a few people in the place. A pretty wide variety of menu items to pick from so I selected the taco salad with grilled chicken. Unsweetened tea to drink was very good. My order came out with minimal wait and tasted great. I will be back to check out more of the menu items soon !! 
Bottom line is it's a solid place to grab something when you're hungry, I don't think that you'll be disappointed !!"}
{"text":"Great local burger joint! I've been hearing great things about this from the guys at work, so I had to try it out. Tuesdays, Double Cheeseburger, Fries and a Drink for $5.99. This is a deal! Each patty is equivalent to three McDonald's patties. These patties also taste like real food and are juicy, not greasy, big difference. Make sure to stop in to check this place out."}
