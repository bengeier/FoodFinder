{"text":"Super good fried food. I've never tried anything but the fried chicken from here. Probably never will. The chicken is just too good. Eaten it for years, it's always been super good. Not very many healthy options, but you can eat better for another meal. It's cash only, but they have an ATM. Make sure to keep your receipt and listen for your order number."}
{"text":"Great food but Will never be back!!! Was missing a .25 tarter sauce in my plate when I told the short dumpy girl at the counter it was missing she argued with me.  It was on my receipt paid but not in my plate. They would  rather lose business than just give me a .25 tarter sauce.  Unbelievable !!!! The counter people need to improve their customer service skills."}
{"text":"Oddly enough, even though it's called the shrimp boat, make sure you order the chicken. It's the best in town. I guarantee you'll love it!! So much flavor!"}
{"text":"Amazing!! Pricey but worth it!! Shrimp plate was delicious their cocktail sauce a bit spicy but nummy  also enjoyed their fried shrooms for the price it was pretty small size/: 
Only thing I might say is they charge for refills /:!! 
And cash only/:!!"}
{"text":"Amazing. This place makes all the other chicken I've ever had taste fake! Great place."}
{"text":"Best fried chicken in Gaston county.   Large sizes compared to KFC and bojangles. Order ahead for to go orders and you will not have to wait very long."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is fantastic!!!!  I've been eatin' here since I cut my teeth!!  I love the fried chicken, 'cause it's second only to my momma's and I love that this place draws in a wide range of Gastonia's finest!  
I aaaalways stop in at the Shrimp Boat when I'm in Gastonia!!!"}
{"text":"Passing through Gastonia, NC  from Kentucky, The Shrimp Boat was a delicious treat! We had a variety of dishes our favorites included the fried chicken and green shrimp. We topped it off with the fabulous banana pudding. The Shrimp Boat offered terrific value along with a friendly staff & owner. A definitive stop next time we are in the area."}
{"text":"Best got dang chicken I ever had! Slapped my momma right after we had it, get it, you won't."}
{"text":"Local business. Fast and friendly service. Fried, fried and more fried. Chicken, seafood, livers and gizzards! Off the \"strip\" off highway 85 and worth the 2 mile drive. Cash only."}
{"text":"Not the same as it used to be. Felt sick the next day after eating here. Definitely won't be back"}
{"text":"Good fresh shrimp fried perfectly. Hush puppies could have been sweeter but we're still very good. I will definitely go back here again when I am in the Gastonia area. Note:This place is a CASH ONLY spot so make sure you grab cash on the way if you are a card carrier."}
{"text":"When I moved to Gastonia I used to get a kick out of the sign for The Shrimp Boat.  Right below the name was the statement, \"try our chicken.\"  It just struck me funny that a restaurant name Shrimp Boat would insist you try their chicken.  It's like getting the hamburger at a Chinese restaurant.  Then I saw it listed in the Gazette at the top of the list of \"Gaston's Treasures\", a list of the best attractions in Gaston county, as voted on by the community.  Even more surprising was the gap in the number of votes between the Shrimp Boat and whatever came in 2nd place, which I don't recall.  At that point, I had to give it a try.  While I'm that much closer to my first angioplasty for having done so, I'm glad that I did.  The chicken is excellent.  As far as hole in the wall fried chicken restaurants go, this is a close second to Price's Chicken Coup in Charlotte.  And unlike Price's, The Shrimp Boat has a place to sit and eat!"}
{"text":"Really like this place, best chicken i have had in a while! only problem they are not open on mondays and cash only. other than that they are great!"}
{"text":"The food is very pricey for the amount you get. Everything is also very greasy. The employees could be friendlier as well. I'm not really sure why it has so many great reviews because my experience was awful."}
{"text":"Boiled shrimp was excellent. Cocktail sauce has the appropriate amount of horseradish to give it just the right bite back! Counter service and cash only. Definately worth wandering downtown."}
{"text":"I think they serve the pre-breaded, frozen shrimp.  Definately not fresh...which was a disappointment, considering this place is called The Shrimp Boat.  After talking to a regular, I learned what The Shrimp Boat does best is actually fried chicken.  So, don't go there if you are looking for fresh seafood."}
{"text":"5 stars for the salt and pepper chicken and excellent price. The inside was large and clean. I noticed while dining in a lot of people call in their orders and pickup."}
{"text":"Experience is amazing simple but delicious.
  Evrythings amazing. Green Shrimp is a start and end with the fish Yummy"}
{"text":"It's just a stop you have to make when you go to Gastonia. The chicken is extra crispy. The hush puppies are to die for. Friendly service but they only take cash. You'll love anything you try from the menu. Going there is like a family reunion. Love it."}
{"text":"Probably the best chicken in the Gaston area, The chicken livers are also very good. Very clean with plenty of help."}
{"text":"I love the food and the employees smile's. Everything is fresh and hot. Very nice and clean  place to eat in or take out..."}
{"text":"Great food..... fast.! Their fried chicken is the best and the fried chicken gizzards are too die for!  The seafood platter is wonderful as a variety dinner."}
{"text":"Great place , love there chicken!!! 
That's what there noted for!! 
They also have a banquet room. Again
Great place."}
{"text":"People were friendly but the food is over priced. You even have to pay extra for cocktail sauce. I wasn't impressed with the chicken and my husband's shrimp wasn't any better than Captain D's. This place is cash only. It's a popular place and well organized but the noise level is not conducive to a pleasant lunch. Next time, I will go to Captain D's."}
{"text":"I visited here once and there was not much on the menu but fried food.  Nothing.  I guess it's OK for what it is trying to be, but not for the health-conscious."}
{"text":"I love this place. A bit pricey for seafood, but it's so good. Their chicken strips are delicious and green shrimp! Also, the BEST banana pudding I have ever had hands down. Love coming here!"}
{"text":"This is the best fried chicken in Gastonia!

I was a little skeptical of the this place, but as they say: Don't judge a book by it's cover. The place inside it large, clean, and friendly. I can't say much for the other menu items because I usually stick to carry-out chicken only, but I'm sure they are pretty good too. 

Cash only! And no, not even checks (boo)."}
