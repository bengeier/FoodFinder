{"text":"The buffalo chicken salad was terrible. They forgot the dressing, the lettuce was wilted, the cheese tasted like mold, the chicken was so brown it was almost black and it was completely dried out and cold. It was supposed to have buffalo fries on them. They were really soggy slices of fried, cold potato with dry buffalo seasoning on them. Their buffalo sauce/seasoning doesn't taste good. It's a weird sweet, spicy flavor. The jalape√±o poppers were fine. They did give me marinara for them but that's so weird. No one wants cold marinara for cheddar poppers. Even though the delivery instructions were included and I explained it to the driver on the phone as he was standing outside my building, I still had to walk to the other end of the building and go outside and get my own food. The point of a delivery fee and 20% tip?? Idk. Never ordering from here again. What for? There are many other great pizza places in the area to order from."}
{"text":"While the food is good.. the customer service is HORRIBLE!!!  The young girl in the back is so rude.. she pretty much threw my dressing at me SINCE she is the one who forgot it and was mad when I had to go back to the store.. not to mention that she put onions on my gyro.. I said NO ONIONS ON ANYTHING.. ANYTHING.. said it twice so she got an attitude for HER mistake.. then the guy (not the old guy) yelled at me in a different language..  NEVER AGAIN..."}
{"text":"Food is always delicious! We had delivery today and it was delivered ahead of quoted time. My daughter had cheese pizza which she loved. I had the grilled chicken Greek salad. The chicken was moist and well seasoned. Lots of veggies besides lettuce. Yum!"}
{"text":"The pizza here reminds me of my old favorite pizza place (Pizza la Bella) that used to be on Babcock Blvd. There pizza was amazing back then. The overall taste reminds me of it for some reason which is definitely a good thing. I recommend eating here or getting a delivery. Don't look at this as an average pizza joint because it's so much more than that. Don't go to a chain fast food pizza place just to fill your stomach... Go here instead for pizza that actually tastes great."}
{"text":"Tried to get a delivery through Grub Hub.  No delivery  but full refund."}
{"text":"I stopped by here this past Thursday evening for pizza with my fiance.  Honestly I didn't even know that this place was open earlier that day but I received their menu in the mail and decided to give it a try.  It is located in the space where Belle Donna used to be on Perry Highway and has much of the same decor.  It is bright and clean though and if you stand at the counter you can pretty much see everything that they are doing.  

Things started out a bit rough as during my call I had a bit of a hard time ordering.  I asked for an extra large pizza which somehow got translated on the phone into a large pizza with extra cheese.  Luckily I was using a coupon and it got straightened out before I was told that it would be ready in 20 minutes.  We arrived at the restaurant 45 minutes later and the pizza was ready sitting on top of the oven.  It ended up being huge at 18\" and was more than enough food for both my fiance and myself.  This is coming from a guy who normally has no problem eating 14\" and 16\" pizzas by himself.  As with all pizzas, this one could easily broken down into its 3 major components: cheese, sauce and crust.  I will start off with the sauce which I did not find to be that exciting.  It was there and coated the pizza and while it didn't have an array of spices to add to the pizza, it did nothing to detract from it either.  The crust on this pizza was pretty good.  It was cooked through with a firm outer texture (it was still a bit floppy whenever picked up) and a nice soft inner.  Finally the best part of the pizza was the cheese.  Man was there a lot of it and it was a good mixture too!  

The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  The pizza that we ate here was pretty good and you certainly get a lot of it for your money.  As a matter of a fact, I may have even found a new local pizza place to give some more business too whenever I am hungry!"}
{"text":"So I did as promised, and I gave them another try. It was worse than the first time. I got a chicken parm hoagie again, fries, an order of Giano bites, and cannoli. 

The sandwich was better than the last time, still a bit meh but it was edible. The Giano bites resemble Domino's parmesean popper things, but they tasted awful, almost like the cheese was overcooked. The cannoli had no flavor to it, and the chocolate chips inside were so sparse I was surprised to taste one on the third bite. 

Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice... well let's just say I won't be back."}
{"text":"Everything we've ordered has been great! Eggplant parm, chicken caeser salad, gyro, pizza, wings. Our go to delivery place."}
{"text":"My family is ADDICTED TO THE GYROS AND CANNOLLI!!! We have at least twice a week. Fast and friendly service  well recommended, folks!"}
{"text":"Do not ever order from Gubhub for Pizza Giano.  We ordered at 11:21 PM and was estimated 60-70 minutes.   That went by and an estimate popped up 1:55-2:05 AM for a single pizza.  What a scam.  Do not order from them!  They are not reliable!!   I have screen shots to prove it!   The only reason I have one star is because it won't let me delete it!"}
{"text":"Ordered a plain cheese, plain wings with sauce on the side (to keep em crispy) and eggplant parmigiano. Pizza is exactly what you want, good sauce/dough and cheesy.  Wings weren't crispy but still decent (hot sauce seems to be RedHot and Italian dressing). EP was very good."}
{"text":"We ordered a large buffalo chicken pizza for $17.99 and garlic cheese bread for $1.99.  The pizza crust tasted like cardboard and there was barely enough cheese and toppings to cover the thing.  It reminded me of one of those hot and ready pizzas for $5.  I am pretty sure the crusts are the frozen kind that are pre-made and purchased.  The garlic cheese bread was not even toasted but somehow the cheese was melted on the top.  It was the bottom half of a hoagie bun that was probably purchased from Restaurant Depot as well.  It smelled like rotting fish so we didn't even eat it.  I will never order from this place again."}
