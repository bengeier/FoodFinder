{"text":"I'd first like to say that I enjoy Persian food as these Iranians know how to make their dishes!   When I first walked in, I was greeted with a smile by both the server and the cook who were both down-to-Earth and made me feel welcome.  Their menu is vibrantly displayed on a huge Toshiba T.V. screen and has a decent selection of both Persian and North American dishes.   The server had  jokingly suggested to me that I should try their Javan Burger as it is the only  Persian restaurant to offer a hamburger that has the same taste and feel as an Iranian kebob.   So I ordered the burger and the wait time was quite decent as it only took to prepare my burger around 10 minutes but I saw the cook pull out a FRESH PATTY OUTSIDE THE FRIDGE and cooked it right in front of my eyes while he was maliciously smiling at me......JUST JOKING!!.....he just slapped it on the grill and told me it would take around that time to prepare it while he played some music for me and WAS DANCING LIKE CRAZY! LOLZ, this cook has guts!   When I finally received my meal, I took a bite and the taste was just as expected, it tasted like a typical Iranian kebob albeit it had a \"local Canadian kick\" to it.    Now, the fries weren't unique as it was the same \"factory frozen\" fries but the server was quite attentive and offered to bring a rice dish to me free in lieu of the fries, but I declined her offer BECAUSE I WAS FEELING SUICIDAL THAT NIGHT.....Nah!......I just ate the fries.    Now, the patty for the burger wasn't quite unique as say like how Chef Burger up North in Richmond Hill makes their patties but was adequate to fill you up.   Now, you can get this entire meal for around $12.00 after taxes, but still, I notified both the server and the cook that the \"price wasn't right this time (insert Bob Barker reference in here)\" and they could work on their menu, quality and pricing a bit more.   Both the server and cook had, with warm hearts, accepted my criticism and had apologized if I wasn't satisfied with their menu options but told me that they would consider my suggestions would bring out more menu options in the near future.   So, if you ever wanted to check out a fusion cuisine of both Iranian and North American food, then Javan Kebob is your best place to be with FRIENDLY CUSTOMER SERVICE, A GOOD ATMOSPHERE AND PEOPLE and to top it off, QUICK SERVICE!"}
{"text":"It's a nice place to grab a quick a Persian-Canadian fusion sandwich or a burger. The menu is small, but makes up for it with shorter prep time than a lot of other places. It's a small take out/ quick bite place, nothing fancy. Anyway, it was exactly what I expected."}
{"text":"Persian food is one of my favs and living close to Yonge and Steeles allows me to always get my cravings in when I need it.  Javan Kebob is a nice little place that offers something most other Persian restaurants don't.  Pros: Persian burgers Lots of rice given with dinners  Cons: Not many items available on menu  Javan Kebob is tucked away in a small little plaza.  You will definitely miss it if you don't know about it.  I only found out about it while picking up a pizza at the Pizza Hut next door.  It's a pretty small place with about 2 or 3 tables in total.    Like the previous reviewer I was urged to try the burger as well.  I came in mostly for the Beef kebob dinners as that is my baseline order for a Persian restaurant.  I have to say though, this is the only Persian restaurant I have been to that has ever offered burgers.  It's a nice twist on things and I will probably come back to try the burger when I get a chance.  The beef kebob dinners were pretty standard.  It's what you expect, nothing more, nothing less.  I do want to note that they give you a lot of rice.  It was so plentiful that I was able to save some for my lunch the next day.  My usual gripe is that Persian restaurants don't give you enough rice with the meals.  The fact that you get only a tomato with meals adds more to that gripe.  The extra rice really made up for that fact for me at least.  Another thing to note is the menu.  It's not very vast at all.  There are about 7 items to choose from basically.  I like a good lamb shank dinner once in a while and it appears to not be available here.  Unless there are items available that are not on the menu, your choice is very limited here.  All in all, like I said Javan is a pretty decent place to get some Persian food if you're craving it.  There isn't too much choice but what they have, they do well."}
