{"text":"Food is okay. The service is very bad. Try not to get served by the server with a star tattoo on her right hand. She has very bad attitude. On several occasions we tried to flag her down for service and she just ignored us despite not many people in the restaurant.  We WILL NEVER GO BACK to this restaurant again!!!!"}
{"text":"To start off our review we came here yesterday for dinner when the weather was -20 degrees outside. 

Overall for dinner the food was great (4 star) and we had no issues with service (4 star). 
My biggest problem was the temperature inside the restaurant. The owner for some reason decided that it wasn't worth the effort to raise the temperature inside the restaurant to room temp. So what did they use to supplement the frigid cold inside you ask? One revolving portable heater for the entire place!

So there we are with other patrons still in our winter coats eating. It really takes away from the dining experience when you have to rely on hot food to warm you up. Then again maybe it's a new dining experience I haven't heard of? Freeze them inside to appreciate your food more? 

To top it off we brought our 5 month old to eat with us and one of the waiters asked us \"why are you bringing her out? It's so cold\". Lol just because we have a child doesn't mean I lock her up at home all the time. Maybe try heating up your restaurant next time?"}
{"text":"Ordered a 5LB lobster meal and although the lobster itself was delicious, the rest of the dishes were just okay. It was nothing too special compared to your other Chinese seafood restaurants, especially at a cost of ~$160 (they include a 10% gratuity automatically in your bill). 

Also, for a meal with such a big lobster, not once did we get new plates or have our plates switched out as can normally be expected. When we asked for extra napkins, the waiter only gave our table of three two napkins. It also took forever to catch the attention of a waiter even though the restaurant wasn't that busy and they were adequately staffed. 

Overall, the customer service could definitely improve, the food was okay, and I wouldn't be against returning to try more dishes, but I wouldn't be jumping at the chance either."}
{"text":"The food was good! (Don't get me wrong) I came here on a weekend (wedding trip) with cousins and we were just meeting up with relatives for dinner. They ordered ALOT of food, and all of them were rather tasty. My elimination of stars began when me and my cousin were sitting on the large table right by the walls with the patterns of bottles. The WHOLE entire time, liquid was falling down from the ceiling every couple of minutes. The first couple of times, it hit my face with such force that I had thought someone had spit on me. Trying my best to ignore the fact, I went about my meal..but then all of a sudden again, I saw a splash again. This time it wasn't my face, but it was on my food. I looked up, and noticed that the ceiling was covered in wooden tiles with many holes..so I don't know what/where the liquid is coming from, but I do know that it is going to be a safety hazard because it is messing with my food. So unless they fix the issue, I don't plan on recommending it to anyone."}
{"text":"I came here with my family and my dad, who's usually a critic. Despite the high prices, my dad concluded that the food was worth the price he was paying.
We ordered a combo I believe (my Chinese isn't the greatest so I'm not really sure what they ordered before it came). 
I found that the decor reflected what the place was specializing in, which was seafood. 
Pros - The shrimp dish. Presentation on a flat rock was unique but I've seen it before and didn't really seem to compliment the theme. Flavours were very tasty and size of each individual shrimp was reasonable. In particular, the rest of my family enjoyed the soup dish that seems to be pretty popular. 
Cons - Washroom had an \"off\" stench...smelled like seafood... (probably due to the large tank). 
I would come back for special occasions or if someone has a seafood craving."}
{"text":"The Szechuan Style Sliced Lamb arrived with the sliced lamb in a bowl with the spicy sauce and bean sprouts and some glass noodles at the bottom of the dish.  This was really tasty and slightly ma-la spicy.  The consistency and method of cooking of the sliced lamb was that of hot pot style where the raw sliced lamb was boiled in the spicy sauce to lap up its flavour.

The Stir Fried Eggplant, Bitter Melon, and Green Beans was also a bit spicy but the vegetables were otherwise well done and tasty."}
{"text":"We had a reservation for 8 people, but still had to wait 20minutes to be seated. Since everyone was pretty hungry by then, we ordered instantly but the food didn't come until an hour later. The food is average, nothing extraordinary. Giving it 2 stars because of the poor service."}
{"text":"Service is amazing! The staff are super nice and the food is good too. Portions are also pretty big and price is very reasonable. Free dessert and appetizer is also provided. Definitely worth the try!"}
{"text":"Not sure what they're going for here.  Looks like a night club, tables all have a mix match of goodwill type chairs.  Large tanks on the wall with some impressive live fish and shellfish.   Too bad it's dark and not displayed as it could be.

Seafood dishes are ok, but found I was picking at little bits if lobster and crab, to get it out of the shells.  Just overcooked and over battered."}
{"text":"This is a spicy seafood chinese restaurant. They also have cute custard pudding desserts that you must order at the end. All of the dishes were spicy, which I like, but some of the people I came with weren't able to handle the spiciness and needed to chug a lot of water.

Food is yummy, although a bit oily. Price is a tad high for a non fine-dining chinese restaurant. The atmosphere is really neat, they have bookshelves on one side, and under the sea decorations on the other.

I would recommend trying it if you like spicy seafood dishes."}
{"text":"I heard some good things in regards to this restaurant, and so went with a group of 5 people to this restaurant. We had ordered the lobster meal for 4 and added one vegetable to the meal. The meal contained lobster, short ribs,  pumpkin soup, fish fillet with brocolli, and a fried rice. 

overall the meal had nothing really spectacular the best part was probably the top 1 rib. which the restaurant is named after it was pretty flavourful. however the other dishes we all agreed was either too salty, which was the snow pea with garlic. or medicore when compared to other cantonese cuisine restaurants. 

This restaurant has a nice interior and that was a great part, however they have problem when it comes to service times. The chef's were remakrably slow when coming out with the dishes, at one point we waited 20 minutes for a friend rice, which was the final dish. and each dish was so slowly cooked that they cam out one at a time and we finished before the next dish had arrived. 

The lobster was also of note not that great, it was maggie sauce lobster and was not done with any particular memorable. Many other places do it better.  

Overall this restaurant i would not really recommend to friends, sicne there are plenty of options in the same area that offer similar pricing but with faster service and better food."}
{"text":"This place has gotten better over a year. The service is very good. The food is not bad. Few of my friend insist of coming here a few time."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch on a Monday afternoon and a few tables were already occupied at that time. I got the xo stir fried cheung fun for $5.50 and the tilpia eaten in 2 ways (congee and fried in maggie sauce) for 16.99. The congee was huge but they put alcohol in the congee so I felt like I was eating alcohol flavoured congee. It was wierd. The fish wasnt fresh either because it was quite fishy. The fried fish was tasteless. Didnt really taste the maggie sauce at all. The stir fried cheung fun was tasteless. I think they forgot to put the soya sauce. At the end of the meal they gave us complementary mango yogurt. That was also tasteless. Everything I ate was tasteless. Everything came out hot and staff were friendly. Atmosphere is quite dark."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner Sunday night. Ordered the six people meal with an extra dish. Dishes arrived slowly and even after people after us got their dish. Food was a bit on the salty side. Taste was okay nothing to write home about. Their best thing was the veggie dish which is telling consider this is a seafood restaurant. Might come back for lunch but not for dinner."}
{"text":"Meh...it tastes alright.  Portions were huge.  Ordered fish noodle set, they gave lots of noodles but not much of the toppings.  Also ordered a fried noodles with garlic and chillis, again portion was huge, but mostly noodles and not much toppings.

Service was good too, but for that price, I would rather go elsewhere for lunch."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Sunday. A great place if you want some chinese food but want a step up from the usual 'cantonese tea canteens'. We had the house special drunken spare ribs, fish soup noodles with seafood add-ins and a wok fried hor fun. The spare ribs along with chunks of taro were crunchy and tossed in a sweet vinegar sauce. It reminded me of a good sweet-sour chicken dish without the bright red food coloring. The fish soup noodles was a great hit at the table, especially with the add-in options of large shrimp, house-made cuttle fishballs and real scallops. The broth was creamy white with a nice kick of spice at the end. I think the broth was the winner for the day. Also, the little yogurty jello thing comes as dessert on the house. 

We sat on the round stage under the disco ball and lighting track, making the whole table wondering what this place morphs into during the night-time hours. The d√©cor takes a moment to get use to, with the dark intimate lighting, glowing colour-changing lights and a backdrop wall of fish tanks. It's like a traditional chinese tea shop got smashed together with a disco nightclub and had a restaurant as a child. Weird but interesting. Plenty of tables around us were having set lunches complete with lobsters or crab. There were also a couple buffet-style metal bins of soup? stew? that came out to the larger tables.  Seems like a good choice for larger groups but definitely too much food for us."}
{"text":"Your experience with Top 1 is subject to how you order.  If you order la carte, it is pricey.  This rings true regardless of which entr√©e you order.  If you order a combo set, you are in for a reasonably priced treat.

We ordered a $58 combo for dinner.  It consisted of an appetizer, a vegetable dish, a Drunken Rib, and a 2.5lb crab, stir fried \"under bridge\" style (?????).  There are many things that I'd like to talk about, so I organize my review in point form:

1) In the menu, it says this combo is for 2 people.  Pure lie.  It easily feeds 3.  

2) The highlight of the combo is the crab.  The crab we had was meaty and sweet, indicating that it was fresh.  I estimated that there was over 1lb of garlic in the dish.  Yet the garlic aroma and spice was not sharp, indicating the garlic slices were dry when they cooked them.  The crab was nicely fried.  There was a delicious coat of flavours on the shell.  Lick it, eat it, whatever, just don't miss it.  This dish had wok air, which is what under bridge spicy crab is famous for.

3) The other thing the under bridge spicy crab is famous for is the spiciness.  Top 1's version didn't taste spicy to me.  It was nowhere as spicy as the dai-pai-dong version.  You should ask for extra spicy if you prefer it hot.

4) The Drunken Ribs were in essence rib bites and taro deep fried in black vinegar.  It had a harden coat on the outside.  It was another wok air dish.  It tasted average, because the meat needed more tenderizing.

5) The vegetable dish in the combo was small.  It was indeed 2-person portion.  

6) Services was minimum considering the price range.  I expected a change of plates, since they were full of crab shells.  Never happened or offered.  When someone did wait on us, s/he was polite, effective and efficient.

7) The bill came with 10% tips added on.  The calculation was clear.  Someone wrote in Chinese that the final amount was \"all in\".  If you cannot read Chinese, you can clarify with a server.

8) I like the interior decoration.  It is a funky mix of batman statue, fortune cat doll, bookshelves, European armour, Chinese emperor attire, owls, and stuff animals.  Consider yourselves forewarned.

Top 1 serves a few unique seafood entr√©es.  Our family will likely revisit in a bigger group to try other seafood combos.  I won't recommend ordering al carte here, however."}
{"text":"The manager of this restaurant used to do business with my parents quite frequently. When she told us that she opened a new restaurant in the East Beaver Creek area, we decided to check it out, not knowing what it is in the first place.

I didn't look at the reviews before I came here. Had I known about the weird setup, I probably wouldn't have commented as much on...well, it's weird setup. I personally found it more to be a karaoke bar than a club, since there was Chinese music blaring on the background of a TV screen.

We sat in the couch/sofa area. While I enjoyed its comfy feel, I highly suggest against sitting there if you're taller than 5'8\", as you would have to bend quite far to eat.

We ordered a combo for two, which came with cream corn soup, stir fried beef, lobster with cheese, and a side of veggies. We also added a beef shank in Szechuan style. Lamb skewers were also in our want-to-eat list, unfortunately they ran out that night. Eventually the manager gave us two free side dishes to compensate for the lack of lamb skewers.

Honestly, nothing really stood out. The cream corn soup was quite tasty, but everything else ranged from mediocre to average. The lobster was the smallest lobster I've ever seen, but I guess it's because it was meant to share for two people. I honestly wanted to try the lamb skewers though, but next time I guess...

The fish soup noodle options look quite appetizing for lunch. Perhaps I would come back for that."}
{"text":"Delicious seafood but communicating with the staff has become quite the challenge if you don't speak Chinese.  Still, one of my favorite places."}
{"text":"Funky looking place with big round tables but also booth and couch seating. The decor is very eccentric - the walls are painted pretty out there colours. There's a wall of books, a terrace of themed coffee cups, and one section of ceiling to floor aquariums. There's also a huge projector screen which was playing a nonstop loop of Chinese movies. The last defining piece is this giant circular light piece which makes me think the restaurant could have been a lounge in a previous iteration.

We went against the norm at this restaurant by ordering our dishes a la carte and ordering the Cantonese style ones. The seafood dishes - Maggi style lobster, oysters, steamed fish - stood out in sticking with the theme of the restaurant. Honestly even the short ribs and the sweet and sour pork were good too.

I read a lot of complaints about the service. We had two huge tables of about 12 people each. We were served promptly, able to get refills when requested, and they didn't rush us at all, so no issues on my visit. I'd definitely hit up this restaurant again."}

Top 1 Seafood BBQ Bar Restaurant is trying hard and have some identity issue.

Decoration here is playful with a mix and match of Asian and European flare. 

Lighting was dark and bar like during lunch hour made me a little confused as I stepped in thinking I went to the wrong place? The lunch special menu did offered me some comfort.

3 items to choose from ($8.95 and up) or you can opt for the Mix and Match Noodle Set ($8.25).

My Cold Noodle ($8.95) comes with a gooey tofu egg drop soup, a spring salad and mango pudding. The noodle dish itself though plentiful but a little bland in taste.

Mix and Match Noodle Set is A-OK with a choice of dessert. The honey yam was meh though.

Almost all the dish has a little work of art as part of plating. They were kind of cute.

Top 1 might be one of the most lavishly decorated Chinese restaurant in the area but in a little awkward way. 

The washroom has those high end Japanese toilet seat that would do everything for you...... 

I am still little confused after my initial visit to Top 1. I am not sure if enjoy the experience or not? Would I be back? I am not sure... and confused?!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars

We came here for lunch recently. Yes, the interior is a little odd as others mentioned. It's a mix of random furniture. There are some couches at the far end of the restaurant, which we turned down.

We ordered one of the set lunches, which included lobster and crab, fish in soup, and bok choy. The lobster and crab were a little small, so it made it difficult to eat because there was a lot of shell. However, the fish in soup was really good. The broth was great on its own, but the fish was also amazing. It also includes transparent flat noodles and tomatoes. The bok choy was... well, bok choy. Nothing special there.

We were also given a cup of sweet potato drink at the end, which I didn't care for. I would definitely come back for the fish soup, and to try other dishes."}
{"text":"I really liked this place.  We came as w group of 7 people. Sat at the raised table in the middle next to the Xmas tree. 

The restaurant looks really cool. Its darkish but there are lots of pot lights. The decode is pretty neat. Everything is lit up and changes colour throughout the night.  The restaurant is not crowded like some of the other ones in the neighbourhood where they try to jam as many people in as possible. Also it doesn't smell like old rotten fish like others do.

Food. The food was relish.  We ordered a set and a few extra dishes.  We got a fish soup, Lobster, crab, a chicken dish, beef and mushroom, bok choi, and their signature ribs with taro. Everything was very tasty.  The ribs were everyone's favourite by far. My least favourite was the bok choi. Only because it was so plain. That being said it was still good.  The fish soup was spicy.  Very spicy. My friends ordered rice which I'm thankful. It helped stop the burning. :)

I highly recommend this restaurant. Can't wait to go back."}
