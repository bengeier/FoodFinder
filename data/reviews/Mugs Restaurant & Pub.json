{"text":"This is probably my favourite neighbourhood pub.   Sure it's a quiet spot, not the kind of place to see and be seen, but an honest place. Lots of east coasters amongst their regulars - they always make sure you feel welcome. Service is friendly and efficient.  That's where I go whenever I'm in the mood for good and reasonably well priced food. Drinks are cheap too, and beer is always cold. I usually order the 'extreme nachos', and they sure are pretty extreme - I would never be able to eat all that food by myself. Make sure you have company to share it."}
{"text":"This is a dive with affordable prices. Sometimes they sell 10-cent wings, and good luck finding meat on those things. Or, they sell 10-cent meatballs.  Yes, you can get greek potatoes and greek salad with your burger. The food isn't bad for a neighbourhood pub.  But the service is not great (probably better if you're a regular). Sometimes you'll be waiting a while to hear back from your server. And Mugs gets HOT in the summer."}
{"text":"Why is everyone commenting on wing night, I went wing night, I didn't realize I was going to have to eat Ethiopian chicken wings. Worst wings ever!"}
{"text":"Well I guess I should really post a review on this place as it seems to be where I end up most nights out. Why? Proximity and comfort. I have come to know all the servers and owners. I have become what most might call a regular. Drink specials daily and the food is great as well.   Sit at the bar for an experience to be remembered. Heck, you might even see me. :) Most of the us tell humorous stories from the past and share the happiness that was the day gone by. There are some regulars that can be a bit hard to handle at the \"horseshoe of broken dreams\"(a great moniker given to bar area) but you will be able to spot them right away.  Sit up on the perch or down in the renovated area for a bit more privacy but the \"wood\" is where it's at.   At Mugs you never know what you're going to get. I have been in there nights where a bus load of people rolled in and other nights when you can hear the crickets. Its the constant witty slamming that the servers apply to me on a regular basis that keeps me coming back.  See you soon!"}
{"text":"This is a nice friendly local pub with good food and drinks deals. They also have an amazing quiz night on Wednesdays it is so much fun. With Muggs you get what you pay for they are not trying to be a fancier bar. It does look a bit dated inside but the food is hot the beer is cold and people are friendly. I have been many times great place to just have a beer and chat."}
{"text":"Service was horrendous. Table was filthy and had garbage on it from the previous people. She said she was coming to wipe it up, but never did return with a cloth. When she brought our beers, she spilled half of one on the table and neither cleaned it up nor replaced it. It would be one thing if she was busy, but she had plenty of time to visit at the bar with what appeared to be regulars. We longed for the spectacular server that we had last visit, however because her service is really that good we could only watch with envy at the people enjoying themselves in her packed section. Definitely ruined what had promised to be a fun evening and we just went home."}
{"text":"Great service! Server was quick and awesome! Yummy wings and fried pickles ... Fun trivia night and great atmosphere. Definitely will be coming back over and over!"}
{"text":"Nice little dive bar in the middle of the belt line. Went here for wing night and wings were good but pretty tiny. Looked like the have some pretty decent prices on other days."}
{"text":"Mugs is your classic sports pub done well. You won't find anything that surprises you, but you will find a seriously comfy pub with cushy booths and padded chairs to relax in while you down beers, watch the game and eat tasty pub food. Mugs kicks it up a notch from your typical pub favourites like nachos, wings and burgers adds a bit of a Mediterranean flare with Souvlaki, pitas and I had the Medditerranean Grilled Chicken  - souvlaki style grilled chicken, sundried tomatos, cheese and lettuce on a Ciabatta. For $14 it wasn't way better or worse than what I would expect for pub grub, but it's still pretty tasty and a nice switch up from yet another night of nachos.  They've got TV's from every angle you could need and a large projection screen for watching sports. YAH SPORTS!  The game was cranked pretty loud but its was THE GREY CUP! I'm not sure if they play through the TV commercials on full volume for every game they show, but The Grey Cup is definitely a special circumstance when this is allowed. You gotta take in the full Grey Cup TV and pub experience. Commercials and all!"}
{"text":"From outside, you wouldn't expect much.  There is more to this little pub than meets the eye.   Good deals, friendly staff, and lots of tv's makes Mugs Pub a great place catch the game, or just catch up.   I approve ;)"}
{"text":"A classic pub - low rent, erring to the side of white trash, complete with classic rock. Food is pretty decent. I think Sookie Stackhouse would approve (I know I do)."}
{"text":"If I was cool I would go here. Good pub quiz and specials. I think the deep fryer works triple OT"}
{"text":"So on the outside its a typical dive bar. On the inside its a local favourite with some obvious frequents and a decent menu. The specials are generous, as are the portions. Nothing is outstanding, but why would you expect that? It just feels like they know their place and double on the service and servings while not being halfbad in the first place. Tell me if you agree."}
{"text":"That's when you have no expectations because after a half-day of meetings by the Core's trendier places like Earl's and Double Zero Pizza.  So came here to really relax and you sure can when you see their booth seating, on the left, which is separate from the U-shaped bar when you first walk in.  total casual setting and heritage-like feel.  amazingly, haven't had any ribs since I've been here, and it was either that or the nachos but thought the ribs would be a better option in terms of digestion lol.  very yummy bbq sauce, made in-house, and meat cooked to perfect tenderness, literally falling off the bone.  Even a half-rack's good enough.  Comes w/ garlic toast.  free parking in this strip mall, albeit busy.  Plenty of side street parking.  They've also got wings nite special on Wednesdays.  friendly staff."}
{"text":"Always had fun there, from sitting at the bar and chatting to the friendly regulars to watching sports at a booth table. Surprisingly good food also."}
{"text":"I love this place ! They have amazing chicken fingers and great portion sizes. I've been a few times for different ocasions from an aquard first date to a late night cap with friends, it's always a good spot."}
{"text":"Terrible service!!! If I could give them zero stars I definitely would!! I think the service in this bar is probably the worst in all Calgary ... I can't think right now in a place with a worst service than here!!  I just came for drinks with a friend.. And first they told us that it was too busy and there was no place available... Then some people from inside offer us a couple seats at the bar... So we stayed... I ordered a wine and it was really bad!! Tasted like alcohol!! Just disgusting, so I asked the bartender if he could change it  and he said no, because he already served... And in my glass was only a little as most of the wine was in the bottle and I never touched it!! Soooo... I just ordered the bill and left!  THIS IS DEFINITELY ONE OF THE WORST SERVICES IN CALGARY!! I do not recommend anyone to come here!! I have been in more than 200 places in this city and nothing is as bad as this one!!"}
{"text":"This place looks pretty mediocre from the outside but on the inside it is everything I want in a bar. Great drinks at great prices, roomy tables, big tvs, and a wonderful waitress who stopped to chat but never seemed behind on people's service.   No frills, just a great lil pub!"}
{"text":"Mugs is just as advertised. It is a pub. There is nothing terrible and nothing exceptional about this place. Food is good service is good and the beer is beer. It's close to my house and is convenient.   I have never let this place unhappy or incredibly impressed. But I do keep going back"}
{"text":"Doesn't look like much on the outside or inside for that matter but the drink specials are great, Long Island ice tea and cesars tasty and the staff is friendly. Recommend!"}
{"text":"It's warm, it's welcoming, they have booths and a standard pub/Mediterranean menu.   Booths you say?  What I love about Mugs, is you can always find a place to plonk your behind, there is the giganto booth in the back corner for a party of 8 or more, booths for 6 if you squish, but very comfortable for 4 and then the mirrored landing which houses a lot of tables and makes the pub look twice as large. The horseshoe bar is actual where you won't find a seat, this is reserved for regulars and the guy who is always in his combat fatigues.   Mugs is just comfortable. Food and beer are well priced and decent. Service is friendly.  I will tell you, they make the worst ceaser here, and if you order the poutine your getting a pure western Canadian version.  Get the tzatziki dip or the bacon, avocado burger.  Review #14 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012"}
{"text":"perfect little neighborhood pub! service from Ann Marie was awesome! $5 appies, $8 pizzas, cheap pints."}
