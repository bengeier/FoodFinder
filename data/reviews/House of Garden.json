{"text":"Food Quality & Price: Conveniently located with plenty of parking, this is a great place to go for authentic Chinese cuisine. Compared to other authentic Chinese restaurants, the food quality and price here are very competitive. Our family often orders lobster chow mein, steamed fish or peking duck.  All of which are great quality (freshly made and well made). Often with dishes like these, they give us complimentary soup and dessert. Our family of four was able to have a meal for under $50.

Facility: Typical of Chinese restaurants. Washrooms are okay. There are TVs on Fairchild playing but it's only audible from closer up. 

Service: Usually very pleased with the service. Kind, polite, fast and attentive. Most Chinese places often sacrifice service for price, but I feel like House of Garden's wait staff are better than most. Tea is refilled without prompt, finished dishes are cleared, soup is poured for you etc.

Overall: My family enjoys coming to House of Garden for a good dinner on a weekday evening. Competitive prices for good food. Solid 4/5. Areas for improvement could be updating the decor and prioritizing cleanliness. Some of the fake plants look like they haven't been dusted or wiped in a while."}
{"text":"I came here with my family to celebrate my birthday with some dim sum. I was quite surprised to find that they were actually able to accommodate my usual family birthday dinner during lunch time. That meant Peking duck and lobster at noon! (we're a fancy people) 

The Peking duck was quite good, though one family member thought the patries were too thick. I thought they were just fine. The lobster was also pretty good, and they actually brought it out while it was live so we could... confirm that it was real, or bless it or something. I don't remember anything else really, but I enjoyed the meal. 

The location is quite modern, a far cry from the grungy pink and green decor of my youth. It looks like most Chinese restaurants are heading this way, even those with really good food at cheap prices. Confusing.

Nothing really stood out for me here, but it was all pretty tasty. I tend to choose dim sum places more on proximity than the food, since they more or less all seem the same to me, so I might come back if I were in the area."}
{"text":"My parents favorite dim sum place!!! Very cheap but this time the quality of food sucked!!! It was a disappointment since usually this place isn't that bad!!! I was looking forward to sum sum too! The fried noodles barely have any crunch and the sauce was way too salty!! The rice noodle with fried dough, the fried dough was overly fried... The veggies we had tasted bitter, and the char Sui bao was soggy!! the only good thing was the Siu Mai !!! Especially since it's my parents favorite place, I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"My family tends to come here for dim sum a lot during weekends, decent food and prices but service could be better.  Sometimes they forget our order but the food usually comes at an adequate time or sometimes very quickly.  
Mango pudding here is awesome, as with the duck feet with peking sauce.  

Only been here for dimsum and not for regular meals.  Can be quite busy on holidays, everyone comes flocking"}
{"text":"My parents refer to this place as \"our kitchen\" because we're here so often. It's a great neighbourhood family restaurant serving delicious Chinese food. The prices are good and the variety of choices is wonderful. They are mid priced restaurant with great value. Their dinner menu and selection is way better than their dim sum."}
{"text":"I go here for the dimsum on the weekends! Each dimsum plate is pretty good value! For five people our bill usually comes to around $45-50 in total (about 15 dimsum items with lobster chow mein). Also, there are no ladies pushing carts here. You would just order off their dimsum menu sheet. They have the usual favorites, Ha-gow, Siumai, fried turnip cake, egg tarts, curried octopus, chicken feet...etc. But they also have some interesting items: Osmanthus jelly, steamed egg pudding, Korean style BBQ short ribs. I have to say I absolutely love getting their Korean style BBQ shortribs- its so crispy and delicious. The Fried lobster with ginger and green onion with chow mein (not dimsum, but we usually order it) only costs $12.99 a plate which is quite the deal! But, of course it doesn't have quite as much lobster as competitors that price it at $17-18 a plate.... but still good nonetheless if you want a taste of lobster! I found servers to be very friendly and accomodating, which I enjoy very much!

Some issues that bother me is that some of my dimsum orders have gone missing.  This is usually when they're busy and have a full house. We ended up waiting and asking several different servers. They all said they would check on our order, but nothing came back to us after waiting an additional 20 minutes when we were done with our meal. This kind of thing happened at least a couple of visits. For the most part though, it has been consistently good. As well, if you have a choice in choosing your table, do not choose the banquets off the back wall (near the washrooms)! The one time we had this seating the floors had food riddled underneath the tables. In addition, I have to say that their deep fried foods from their dimsum menu are not always hot."}
{"text":"Gross. Came here for dim sum. Long wait for the weekend which was expected but I didn't expect my shrimp rice rolls to come with hair. Not just one, not two, but three separate hairs  found on two different rice roll dishes. Did someone decide to comb out their locks while wrapping these rolls? When we complained they just looked at as and asked what we wanted them to do about it. Terrible way of handling this. Bad service all around. If I could give zero stars I would. Definitely not a very clean place to eat. Granted the dishes are cheaper than most dim sum places at $2.40 a dish but I'd rather pay a bit more for better food and service. Avoid if you'd rather not find surprises in your meal."}
{"text":"House of Garden took over which is use to be Full House Chinese Cuisine (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/full-house-chinese-cuisine-markham-2). 

The layout of the restaurant remain pretty similar but a minor makeover was done with new light fixtures, new flooring inside of those sticky old carpeting and new tables and chairs. 

The menu has similar offerings as a lot of Cantonese Congee/Noodle restaurants but with additional of Cantonese entree dishes. 

Chiu Chow Congee with shredded chicken and oyster clams ($5.25) 
- We were pleasantly surprised with how good this Chiu Chow Congee is 
- only place I been to add so much different garnishes 
- really strong and intense flavour 

Vermicelli with Preserved Sour Vegetables and Beef ($7.95) 
- Did not look too promising when it was presented to us steamy hot 
- But it tasted much much better than it looks! 
- the beef was quite tender and the vermicelli soaked up all the sauce make it so tasty! 

Chinese Broccoli ($4.25) 
- I don't understand why they can mess up this simple dish... Veggie was so overcooked it tasted mushy... 
- I just want my veggie to be cooked... not turn into baby food! 

Since the restaurant is quite new, the wait staffs here are not really attentive and they kept messing up our orders... 

There is lunch specials (11:00 to 3:00 PM) for $5.99 that comes a drink.. and for afternoon Tea is from 2:30 to 5:30 PM.. 

They accepts Cash only!"}
{"text":"Quality, Service, Price the three things that are important values in a restaurant. House of Garden is a restaurant that specializes in chinese cuisine and has a morning dim sum menu. 
The food is authentic the service can be better and the price is fair.
Some cons to this restaurant are the servers. On a busy night the servers tend to miss or mix orders, the food can come out a little slow and the restaurant is on the loud side. 
This restaurant gets 4 stars for having 2 of the 3 things I look for in restaurants - good food and price. 

If you ever have a craving for a nice cheap and delicious chinese food experience I definetly recommend this place."}
