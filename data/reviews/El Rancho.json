{"text":"I'm not too much into the salsa dancing, how ever do enjoy the music and people watching. I have eaten at El Rancho many ,many times and absolutely love the food! Think I've tried quite a few menu items and still love the mixed grill meat platter for two and the chorizo and empanadas for my appetizers. True their wine list is not as extensive as I would like but that's not what I'm there for. The music and the food are as authentic as you can get.  I will definitely always go back."}
{"text":"been here for new yrs a few days ago :) why I give 3 stars is bcuz: it took 'em 1 hr to serve us, OK they were busy... There was a hair on my cheescake... OK I survive this too... BUT:
THEIR AD PROMISED CHAMPAGNE AT MIDNIGHT BUT WE ONLY GOT SERVED CHEAP WHITE WINE MIXED WITH TAP WATER  (the girl thought we were drunk/blind and would not see... she added tapwater to the bottle which was not champagne anyways... it tasted awful)
Otherwise the crowd was good, no shady folks, and I liked the fact that many parents brought their teenager kids with them. One more thing, the lowest floor had a bit of a mildew smell due to poor ventilation.... Maybe I go back next time as the food was good and staff were friendly."}
{"text":"Average... That would be the best word to describe my entire experience year. Now mind you the service is average because that is not the restaurants fault, or is it?

There was only one waitress available when we got there and the restaurant was nearly half full, she was quick to take our first drink order and food order but the food took forever to arrive. And when it did arrive it was quite mediocre.

I've been to Mexico and have had traditional Mexican food from an authentically Mexican family, this lacked the same freshness and spicy flavor that I remember from my time in Mexico.

It reminded me of something that a very talented cook, a friend of mine, would make me say on a themed food night. Although it was good certainly did not have any of the Mexican flair and taste that I would expect from a restaurant that specializes in this cuisine.

Worth a visit but there are many other Mexican restaurants to try out on the street."}
{"text":"Arrived just after 7 pm for dinner and headed up the stairs to the 2nd floor restaurant & club. Only 3 other tables occupied at this time so we scored  the preferred window table.  

We were limited to a couple of red wines served by the glass, so as we hesitated our server  offered us a small sample of their red wine. We appreciated her kind gesture, but we both felt it tasted like homemade wine your uncle Gino would make back a few decades ago. We opted for white wine and  Dos Equis Lager.  

Cheesy with a multitude of unrelated \"themes\". Archways, white stucco. Table cloths and linen napkins.  

Dining in a Spanish & Latin restaurant, we ordered one of the two house specials - Paella Valenciana for 2  $41.95 - Rice, Chicken, Sausage and Seafood, including lots of mussels,  oven baked and served in its authentic iron dish.  25 Minutes preparation time  so pace yourself or you'll be on round 3 of drinks before ya know it! We both loved  the food but stayed clear of the club in the back heading for my favourite tequila bar - Reposado."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten at the restaurant, my friends and I were only there for the \"nightclub\" which was not exactly what we were expecting. It is definately geared towards an older crow (I'd say the average age was mid-30's, with a few 20-somethings).   If you're just looking to salsa it was ok though, at first the floor was empty but after a while everyone was dancing and its easy to find a dance partner even for beginners, but it seemed like the majority of people who go there are regulars.  Dress was casual, but beware of the extremely sweaty older guys in tight shirts.  I wouldn't suggest it for a younger crowd BUT a girl in the washroom suggested Babaluu, I haven't been there yet but I will keep you posted :D"}
{"text":"Haven't been there for the food but the nightclub section is as Margaret M described it.  Maybe things are a little better when you blend in with the crowd of old crows, but when you're in your early-20-somethings and old men keep MAKING you dance with them (demanding, literally, and telling you and your friends in the face that it's rude to refuse), it's uncomfortable.  Salsa dancing is just a front!  These people are NOT salsa dancing.  It's their excuse to hug excessively and grope you!

I've been to all kinds of clubs in my lifetime (from hip hop/R&B to rainbow village to goth and punk bars) but never had my friends and I lined up to take showers at an early after-party before.  

GROSS VIBE.  GROSS."}
{"text":"After being away from the dance scene I decided to hit the dance floor. We had a dinner reservation which included a package: appetizer, main dish, beverage, dance class and entry to the social. (Entry is usually 12 but Free for woman before 10pm) - package is for $35

My choice of main dish was a medium done sirloin steak with a side of veggies. It was delicious! It was made to satisfy. As for my side I had the carrot soup and bread and butter was complimentary. 

They also had a great deal for beer. 5 beers on any choice was for $25. They even added a little gift when serving the beer. 

As for the salsa class: it's not the best but it's an ok prep for a salsa night. The social was good, there was a mix of all ages, music was great as well."}
{"text":"I was here in a Saturday night for the salsa lessons with a date. The instructor was really nice and made the whole thing really fun (I'm a beginner Salsa dancer). 

As soon as the lesson was over the dance floor was SWARMED with other dancers who really knew what they were doing. It was a little intimidating at first but with salsa even if you only know the basics you can still have a good time!

My date and I ended up dancing the night away and even say to watch the others for a while and realized that there really is no wrong way to salsa!

I accidentally dropped my purse behind one of the speakers and was unable to get it out. I spoke to one of the bouncers and he and another man managed to get it for me with no problems or complaining about how dumb it was of me. 

Very nice staff. From the coat check girl to the hostess to the bouncers to the instructor. 

I would definitely recommend this place to someone who wants to have a really fun time and learn some new moves!"}
{"text":"I was here last weekend for a friend's birthday party. There was about 20 of us. It was a fixed $35 menu: soup or salad to start, 10oz steak, chicken, or grouper fish for the main, coffee. I went with salad and fish. The salad was a side portion of cabbage in what tasted like vinegar dressing. The cabbage was fresh, so, it was very tough in texture. The dressing was very sour. I didn't eat the salad. The fish was tasty but way too salty. In addition, it was not grouper. It was basa fish which is one third of the price of grouper. My boyfriend ordered steak. His take on it was: the steak tastes ok, but rather thin and not even close to 10oz, at best 6oz. We informed the chef about the fish and the steak not being what was on our prix fixed menu. He said \"Ok\" and walked away. I cannot comment on the rest of the menu since I haven't tried it but our prix fixed menu was very disappointing and way overpriced. Inedible side of cabbage and basa with rice and steamed veg disguised as grouper for $35 plus tax and gratuity is not worth it. I am definitely not coming back to this place."}
{"text":"I am seriously confused by this place.
It's a nice spanish restaurant with regularly priced food (probably out of range for students, but generally average for eating out).
The food isn't amazing, but you'll feel like it was a good experience at the end.  I think it is because they don't use premium ingredients, but the general cooking of the dishes and the recipes are good.
Soe good traditional spanish cuisine.

ok..and then there is this backroom dancefloor business with some seriously confusing crowd.  A salsero crowd, generally, but more confusing are women in VERY tightly clad gear and men in their white button up shirts, that aren't actually buttoned up..and the gold chains hanging out that brings extra attention to their chest hair.  
so... yeah..  (and don't think it is just one or two people...that's the standard dress code for the back room club- they gave my buddy a GOOD up and down look of questionable standard t-shirt jeans dress)
try it..it's interesting and you are bound to have an \"interesting\" time"}
{"text":"TLDR: Latin dance club, good partner dancing, all skill levels, 3 floors, just have fun.  No idea about food but good dance floor.

I came here for the first time last night (Thursday) with some of my friends from the Latin dance scene for a birthday gathering (most of whom were instructors who taught me and have become good friends with, plus some other friends - yes I know Kizomba isn't Latin, but whatever).  Cover was $12. 

Right now, there are three rooms, one for kizomba, one for salsa and one for bachata.  

What to expect: 
-Everyone who is dancing will be sweaty. It's kind of understood in the Latin/partner dance scene because it's a workout in a crowded area.  

-Dance level: All different levels.  There are some beginners, intermediate and pro dancers. For those people who have never done salsa or bachata, it's fine. People are more than willing to dance with you for fun. 

-Personally, I didn't see any people doing anything appropriate considering the context.  Salsa dancing is fun and flirty, while Bachata can be sensual or playful (a bit of both) and kizomba is sensual.  There's a fine line between dancing and groping and for those new to partner dancing, I would recommend you stick to the basic steps.  Most women will appreciate this more than trying to lead them through a sensual pattern and end up doing something inappropriate.  Trust me, they can tell when you're trying to execute a pattern and make them look good as opposed to \"groping\". 

-With regards to the floors, the top floor was kind of slippery but the basement had a good dance floor, not too slippery.  

Service: Friends and I ordered drinks and the server was very quick and did keep checking on us.

Verdict: Friendly service, good dance scene and fun night. Also note that this is a Latin dance club, so more partner dancing than solo dancing."}
{"text":"Imagine what happens inside a woman's brain when she decides to go \"girls night out\" wearing jeans, a shirt and boots: the bouncer is gonna let pass your gorgeous friends wearing beautiful skirts, dresses & heels, but when that \"Douche\" passes the scanner through you: PUM! you are not good enough for the club. One of my friends realized I was the only one with the DO NOT ENTER chain, so she helped me saying I was with her (by the way,when someone behaves that way I do take all my prejudgments out and pass the scanner as well... F everything then no? Like I felt successful just by getting in.)

2 stars because I got so angry and waisted, but at least today they gave me the bag I forgot at the coat check."}
{"text":"Inside the restaurant is very cozy and beautiful...It's great if you have a group party...the reason I gave less stars is because the servants are not knowing what they are doing, they bring our food and drinks very late...but still good to go another time."}
{"text":"Friends and I came to El Rancho a few months ago for a friend's bachelorette party. El Rancho had come recommended on a list of places for bachelorette parties. My friend reserved the party package which included several liquor shots, sparkling wine, a cake (in our case, cheesecake), and balloons. We also had a reserved booth for the 6 of us. 

There were several choices on the prix fixe dinner menu including chicken, steak, and another entree option. All of us ordered the steak option which came with soup or salad, as well as steamed vegetables. Although I was not expecting steakhouse quality meat, the steak was just okay. I was happy that I ordered mine to medium rare doneness. My friends' steaks ordered as well done or medium well came out tough. The cheesecake was pretty decent, and included an assortment of flavours. 

After dinner (and of course mandatory group photos with sombreros), we proceeded to another room where they had a lovely dance instructor who walked us through steps to learn bachata and another Latin dance. This was a lot of fun. There were several other bachelorette parties also present that night and many also participated in the dance instruction which takes place from 9-10:30pm.

After 10:30pm, the Latin dance club opens. It was PACKED with hot sweaty people on the dance floor. This place was busy with lineups outside the door even after 1am (they are open until 3am). El Rancho  is good for groups and is worth checking out if you're looking for a one-stop night out with friends who enjoy Latin dancing. 3.5 stars for overall experience."}
{"text":"I am there every weekend for dancing. I love that place, it is the only real salsa club left in the city!!
Music is amazing on Fridays and Saturdays (now they are open on Thursdays, but music is not that good). Crowd is great on Saturdays, fully packed, with two floors/ two DJs.
I highly recommend it as a Friday/Saturday night salsa dancing spot."}
{"text":"Three floors of great music! Latin dance music like salsa and bachata, mostly salsa. Good dancers, so so dancers, and beginners all having fun. Some nights they have free salsa lessons before the club gets too busy.  The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is that it tends to get just too overcrowded on busy nights."}
{"text":"Que bueno! I have been to El RANCHO before, hence its time to post a review for this place.  First off location is central on College St just west of Bathurst El Rancho is similar to Babalu in terms of it being a restaurant/ night club.  Like any HANDFUL of popular Latin clubs, its USUALLY packed! but there have been the occasional one-off Fridays when its a smaller crowed of people.  If you're looking to practice on your bachata, or salsa, El Rancho has a dance crowed that would help step up your game. :) Drinks are reasonably priced, and the people are quite friendly. Unfortunately I cannot comment on the food, because I've only been here for Dance and drinks!"}
{"text":"My friends and I visited El Rancho this weekend for a birthday party. I wasn't expecting much upon arriving. The building looked kind of old and we had to walk up a long set of stairs to get in. The dining room was average but the server was really friendly. I ordered the chicken expecting an average meal but it was actually delicious. The chicken was in a white wine sauce and served with assorted long beans and potatoes. I also got the salad which was also quite tasty. I found the package price here to be pretty good value for what it was. It was $35 before taxes and tips for dinner and a ticket into the club which had beginner salsa lessons starting at 9. We missed a good chunk of the lesson because some of our party members arrived late but all was good. We found out that there are two levels to the club the first level is where the lessons take place. The second level has more seating and a DJ. We mistakenly went to the lower level as we were attracted by the empty booths where we could leave our things. This was a mistake as it smelled quite musty and mouldy on that level. There was also a lot more experienced dancers on that level and they were an older crowd. Next time we would definitely stay on the first level. We had a great night overall and we will be back for sure! I still can't get over how good the food was!!!"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with a girlfriend.  The front of El Rancho is a restaurant, and the back has a club playing Latin music.  It was a cute club and seemed very popular on a Saturday night.  Although we didn't stay long at the club after dinner, I would come back to do some salsa dancing.

Our dinner was great.  I had the Carne Asada (one of my favourite dishes).  The food was delicious and full of flavour.  My friend had the fish, which was equally as tasty.  Everything tasted really authentic.  

We had a pitcher of sangria.  It was sooo sweet though.  I'm not even sure if they had any alcohol in it.  

Prices seemed a bit high for a non-fine dining experience, however, the food was so good, I'd probably come back anyway."}
{"text":"I've been here twice (Fall 2012) and most recently this past weekend. I have to say that my first experience was good but this last one left a lot to be desired. I cannot speak to the food as both times I arrived after 10 pm for dancing only. The place has potential with two dance floors where the music is supposed to vary. The first time I attended the lower level was classic Salsa, Merengue, and Bachata and it was played in sets. The place was full of a variety of dancers, from beginners to advanced salsa dancers. This last time I attended there was no noticeable difference in the music from one level to the other and way too much of what I can only describe as techno-merengue which is way too fast for traditional merengue dancing. By midnight the place is packed and very difficult to dance so everyone ends up packed in tight and the dance floor is a mish mash of people trying to move around particularly for merengue and salsa but bumping into each other, getting stepped on, and stepping on others regularly.

On the first night I attended it was a more mature crowd (30-50s), but this last visit it was easily a 20-40s crowd with lots of the red bull boys, 40-and 50-something guys trying to pick up girls to dance and who knows what else, and packs of girls trying to dance in some intelligent way to salsa. May have to give it one last time, but for now I would say it is not a great place if you want to dance salsa without getting banged around all night and having to fight your way from one end of the club to the other."}
{"text":"The menu is not at all a reflection of some of the reviews, it's very limited and somewhat lazy to be honest.

I came here for a friends birthday party, and they have a special where if you get dinner you can get access to the club afterwards (another major draw). The problem is that we weren't staying but wanted to have a light meal with the birthday girl. The menu is very small and restrictive and not at all good for big groups. The table layout they gave us was pretty tight and poorly laid out. No one could get in or out and everyone was squeezed in an an awkward space.

Atmosphere

The dining area is upstairs off of college street. It's not a bad but parking is most likely on the street. Lots of old dated looking furniture and tables but the lighting makes it look good.

Food:

Here's where I really, really am disappointed with the review. The food felt like it was cooked from frozen. Very cookie cutter, and very generic food. No authenticity to it. The nachos for example was literally just tostitos out of the bag with a very bland guacamole. It also took 40 minutes to serve. It really was disappointing to see. The other main courses looked decent but the steak was blah. Not only did it cost way more than it should, was very dry, overcooked (I asked for medium rare, I got medium to medium well). Very underwhelming sauce as well. Not a huge fan of this. For what they charge I'd be better off eaten at the burrito boyz down the street.

Value:

Unless you like salsa dancing, and on a weekend i'm sure you do, this isn't a place to come just for the food."}
{"text":"Came here last Thursday for salsa/bachata night for the first time and had a great time. Great place for beginners like me and experts. Great energy and the crowd is really friendly. Had a great time learning how to dance and met some cool people. Will definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"HAHAHAHAAHHAHAHAA

this place rocked my saturday night because i laughed so much. it was just a different experience all together. 

Ok so the place is a normal restaurant. and then there is the entire second half which is your classic mirrored spanish salsa club.

worth every penny in terms of the $10 cover. 

Ok so first lets be honest, this is not the kind of place you want to go to if you're not in a group. If you're a girl, you will need some male companionship to help you fight of the barage of insistant spanish guys rolling their r's and rocking the chest hair look.

the place has two main rooms. One that plays salsa, and one that claims to play reggea and reggaetone but actually also plays salsa. 

The crowd is fun. Women who move like nothing i have seen before and men who can keep up. I didn't know bodies were capable of such targeted flexibility.

I went in for an old friends birthday. She has 6 ethnic mixes in her, predominated by this salsa gene. She got us all dancing, and trying,  and by the end of the night, we took over the entire 'reggae' room. I spent the first half of the night entertained by the people watching, then i realized we were the people to be watched. We clearly didn't fit, but people were so friendly and the bartenders were great. 

There was something magical about the night. But the truth is, it was the companionship and loss of inhibition/tequilla. 

If i came back here, i would never see the place in the same light, but at the same time, i would never go here if it weren't in a group birthday environment.

p.s - We all sweat alot. it's one of those places."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favourite Latin Restaurant and Salsa club with 2 different dance floors and 2 DJ's.  The food is outstanding the Bandeja is my favourite dish and the empanadas are a must have.  The club is amazing the music is excellent and the drinks are plenty.  I highly highly recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"Thursday night salsa was a winner! $10 to get in and the dance floor was packed with a lot of good dancers. Salsa upstairs and bachata downstairs."}
{"text":"I went to this club last weekend.. on a Saturday night.. for my one and only time.. the music was good and the crowd was much older. I hated the fact that i had to circle the block multiple times before finding a parking spot on some side street a good block away... when i got into the club i noticed it was fairly small and everyone was dancing like they were on dancing with the stars.. most of the night i stayed by the bar and observed.. didn't really want to get on the dance floor and make a fool of myself.. don't get me wrong.. i know how to dance salsa and bachatta but the music kept switched soo fast between the genre's i would have to really pay attention to stay on beat.

i will probably check this place out another time just to see if my observation was a one off."}
{"text":"El rancho isn't what you think it looks like from the outside. This place has no front windows. You open the door and right away there is coat check to the left and stairs to the right. Once you walk up the stairs on the left there is a restaurant and if you keep walking straight there is a bar with a dance floor(actually it might be Two bars but I'm not sure because at this point I was a bit tipsy). There is an introduction salsa lesson which goes by fairly quickly so you should google basic salsa steps before going. The dancers are really good and the instructions are clear you just can't see them because there are so many people. 
Anyways the music is good and M and I salsa'd the night away. It was a fun time... the only thing is that because the space is smaller than usual, it gets fairly packed and you start bumping into other people which can kind of put a damper on your dance moves."}
