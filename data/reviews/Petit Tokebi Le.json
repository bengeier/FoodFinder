{"text":"I wasn't too impressed with the food. It was okay but I've definitely had better Korean. I had the bento box and only liked a few items."}
{"text":"If you're going to go, get the bibimbap, it's amazing. Been back multiple times and it's such a cute little treasure."}
{"text":"Been eating here for 8 years and have seen the portions get smaller. The miso used to have tofu and seaweed, now half a bowl of powder soup. The chicken katsu box only has a slice of yam cut in three pieces, salad is just leafs of kale , used to have onions and carrots. No more mushrooms either.  I still come here though as it's only resto on my street.
It would be nice if owner asked once in a while if i enjoyed meal."}
