{"text":"My family and I are visiting the city and we decided to try this place out as it was just a 15 minute walk always. It did not disappoint!  We got the 3 tacos and soup special for $10 each.  Added the poisson/fish tacos for and extra $1... Worth it as we have one child and he loved that it was soft and easy to eat.  We also ordered the chicken, beef and cochinita tacos and though they were all quite delicious, my favourite was definitely the fish one.  Other reviewers ordered the guac and so I thought we'd give it a try.  It was also just as others have said.  Probably one of the best I've tried.  Not too much seasoning and can taste the freshness of the ingredients.  It was an added bonus that our son loved to dip the chip and lick off the guac... yup... it was that good.  :)"}
{"text":"Un des rares restaurants mexicains qui offrent la vraie cuisine mexicaine. Nous avons eu la chance de parler avec une de deux cuisiniers et elle est super gentille. Elle nous a expliqué que la nourriture servie a été faite le jour même et qu'il n'y a pas de conservateurs dans ses ingrédients, de plus, sa viande est de bonne qualité. Ceux qui travaillent ici sont très gentilles et respectueux, le service était quand même vite. Nous avons commandé
2 spéciaux (1 spécial = 3 tacos + une petite soupe de tortilla); Un autre spécial, mais une grande soupe de tortilla (+$); Nachos con chorizo; un Pozole et 4 boissons gazeuses pour un total de ~70$. Je crois que c'est subjectif de voir si c'est cher ou pas, car les portions sont respectables. Bref, nous avons bien mangé ce soir et nous allons sûrement y retourner!"}
{"text":"Petite salle à manger bien bondée un dimanche à 13h. Le spécial Frida (petite soupe et trois tacos) à 10$ a été une bonne façon de goûter à différentes saveurs. Le cochonita a été notre taco préféré. Prix abordable mais pas d'accompagnement avec les tacos ou quesadillas. Très bon !"}
{"text":"I had the mushroom tacos
They're vegan and GF! No cheese, no need to substitute or explain away your needs.

The tortilla de maiz was clearly fresh made, as were the sautéed mushrooms and pico.

Also they're just $2.50!
Five stars!
I'll be back soon"}
{"text":"Frida is the real deal.. Authentic cuisine, friendly staff and and cozy home style vibe in the resto.. And not to mention some of the tastiest yet cheapest tacos in the city.. Winner winner Quesadilla dinner!!"}
{"text":"The food at Frida is incredible and cheap, the tacos are fresh and full with flavours and spices. Their fish taco, pastor taco and nopal taco were my favourites. Their horchata is amazing, is the best thing to drink when eating the tacos. The staff is super friendly and that makes me to want to go back to this restaurant even more! These are the best tacos I've eaten in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Wanted to go to the tacos place next door but it was fully pacted. Turns out there was another tacos store next door!

Cheap and amazing tacos! The staffs are great, very fast service and the place is spacious! They also have a little corner where they sell some Mexican groceries (sauce, pitas etc)

Its 2.75$/tacos and honestly eating 3-4 of them is more than enough for me. If you go there, dont forget to try their guacamole as an entree! Its tasty!

As for my favorite tacos, its the Pastor, which is 3.25$ instead, its pork and grilled pineapple! Amazingggg!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a Friday lunch. Very pleasant atmosphere. Had a Corona and two tacos -- excellent! The bill came to $13 which was very reasonable.  Next time I'm trying the tortilla soup, which I understand is very good. Overall, a friendly neighborhood Mexican resto that's authentic.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I don't go to Saint Henri often, but when I do, I make an effort to try some of the new restaurants that are on the Notre Dame strip. Upon my little sister's reccomendation, I've decided to give it a try. 

Good: Very inexpensive tacos at $2.50, that's for sure. We ordered a special on the menu (3x tacos plus a soup). Since I don't eat meat, I've opt for the mushroom tacos and the cactus tacos and my sister picked the beef one. I enjoyed the mushroom one the most and that was kind of it. 

Bad: The nacho soup was strange...it just looks like a cup of oily broth/sauce that just did nothing for my appetite. It tasted as strange as it looked. I just ate the nacho plain. The cactus taco was too soft for my liking (I've had it once at 7 Lives in Toronto, so I thought it was be similar but I was a bit disappointed). 

Bottom line: There are better taco places in Montreal like La Capital. If I am feeling stingy, I might come back here but it is not my first go-to."}
{"text":"Some of the best tacos in town, right up there with a few other Mexican favourites. Great tortilla soup too. Service is friendly, glad they moved to a bigger spot."}
{"text":"Heard great things about this little authentic Mexican so I tried it a couple of times for lunch. There can be a bit of a lineup at lunch but nothing crazy. I've tried the chicken, beef, fish and cactus tacos - as well as a side of guacamole with tortilla chips. Tacos come with your choice of spicy or mild sauce. The cactus taco is yummy and worth trying. Small portions but for $2.50 a taco, it's worth it. The only one I didn't like was the fish taco... I didn't like the flavour. With the other authentic Mexican restos in the area, this one is 3rd on my list after Lupita's and Tacos Victor."}
{"text":"Best tacos and tortilla soup in MTL. Cheap and delish. Casual and comfortable, especially in their new location!"}
{"text":"This small informal venue in St Henri serves authentic Mexican grub. The smell alone when you walk in will make you want it all! I ordered the cactus tacos and washed them down with a mandarin jarritos soda. The filling of those tacos was delicious; perfectly cooked and flavoured, these tacos were the real deal! At 2.50 each, you just can't beat it! The service was extremely friendly and attentive. 

The informal setting, with forks and napkins from a bucket, and the minimally decorated, simple table and chair setting, makes for a real fri badly neighbourhood restaurant. 

You can always grab goods to go as they also offer a mini grocery where you can pick up everything from Mexican candy to canned cactus. The homemade guacamole seems to be a big hit with several walk-ins asking for a container to go!"}
{"text":"Very good simple Mexican breakfasts. Huevos rancheros and divorciados were very good and unpretentious.  Tasty spicy sauce to with it. The decor is simple, and the restaurant is clean and bright with a couple of flat screens to catch some soccer. Will definitely be back to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this place. It's unassuming, relaxed and fun. The horchata was decent, and there's something soothing about eating in a grocery store. I enjoyed the tacos de nopales, and the tinga tacos. I found the chorizo a little salty, but the al pastor was on point. I'll definitely be back for more delicious tacos next time I'm in Saint-Henri."}
{"text":"tacos are awesome, real homemade mexicain food you have to stop here at least once, also prices are really cheap!"}
{"text":"This is authentic Mexican food. Not tex-mex, not processed food. Like \"COMIDA DE CASA\" home made food. Micheladas, home made salsa, real tacos... REAL MEXICAN EXPERIENCE."}
{"text":"Tacos Frida is one of out favorite authentic Mexican restaurants on the west side of Montreal.

The menu is limited but everything we've tried has been great. 

We usually have the soup & tacos special with a quesadilla side order.

The people who run the place are friendly and the service is quick.

FYI - they don't have an alcohol license- so as long as you know this in advance, you will have a super enjoyable Mexican meal for a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"Small, homey restaurant with Frida paintings everywhere, what's not to like? 

Guacamole is amazing, with a lot of tomatoes and onions and cilantro. The side of guac and chips seemed a bit pricey at first but I had enough guac leftover from it to put it on my 3 tacos. 

Tacos were great, tortillas were warm and even slightly crispy. At $2.75 per taco, they were amazing. I had the carnitas, pastor, and the fish taco while my coworker had the carnitas, chicken and fish. We both agreed the fish was a little overdone but the rest were excellent. Her fave was the chicken and mine was the carnitas. Quick service and a comfortable, casual eatery!"}
{"text":"Le menu est très simple et le service est rapide. Les tacos sont petits mais ils sont seulement 2.50$ ou 3$ dépendant de la sorte choisie. La serveuse ne parlait pas français (anglais et espagnol seulement). En plus des tacos ils ont aussi des quesadillas, du cheviche, des churros. Très traditionnel. C'était bon, par contre avec tous les place de tacos dans les alentours ce ne serait pas mon premier choix."}
{"text":"Really bad tacos. Not trying to be mean, just saying the truth so YOU don't make the mistake of eating at this place. The tasteless rice tortillas taste like they were bought frozen from a supermarket a year ago. The meat is ok but the tacos are missing any other ingredients in acceptable quantities. Very overpriced. The dishes are ok but not worth your money or time, small portions."}
{"text":"Wow! Some of the best tacos I've had outside of Mexico. Their tortilla soup is also delicious. Go during any Mexican holiday and they sometimes have tamales."}
{"text":"The tacos are yummy. I would prefer them a little less soggy, but they're still very good. The best thing, I would say, is their tortillas soup! I get that every-time. The restaurant itself is beautifully decorated, and practically a shrine to Frida Kahlo. Service is really good as well."}
{"text":"Don't confuse yourself with the Frida on Atwater. It's two different restaurants. I've been told that this one was opened before the other one. Here, tacos shines. The menu is sweet and short. Nothing too complicated but oh so so good! They also serve breakfast until 3 pm and their guacamole is lovely! The service is super friendly and fast. I really love their green salsa. I even bought some home. A small container (250ml) will set you back 3$ lol
An order of tortilla soup, guacamole and four tacos will cost about 24$ taxes included. Pretty good prices if you ask me. Will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Accompagné par mon ami mexicain il m'a confirmé l'authenticité des repas. J'ai trouvé delicieux mmmm , grand local avec plusieurs tables et boutique avec produitd mexicains pour apporter."}
