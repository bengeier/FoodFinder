{"text":"Let me start off by saying this review is based on their 2010 winterlicious dinner menu (which at $25 was a very resonable) but with all the good reviews i was expecting more. My app was a basic salad not worth mentioning. I ordered the lamb stew as my main. I think they left the lamb in the kitchen cause i couldn't find any in my plate. The dish was unmemorable (literally, i had to find the menu online to remember what i ate). My friend orded the honey fried chicken. It was pretty dry and not to crispy (your better off going to popeyes). Two deserts, chocolate cake and lemon pound cake; both sucked. They could have been pulling the \"I'll give B-rate food for the cheap asses ordering winterlicious\" but then that just makes this place suck even more."}
{"text":"Was here Saturday night unaware they were part of winterlicious, they were busy so any review about atmosphere would be tainted. I don't know if they are that busy all Saturday nights or just for Winterlicious, but I can write about the food.

First off, our waitress was very nice and very helpful with our wine selection as well as throughout the evening and helped make for a nice night out, Thank You to her. 

For our apps I had the Ploughman's Omnivore platter and the GF had the butternut squash soup. One complaint my GF has about any squash soup is that places over season them or fuss over them too much and ruin it. This one was not. This soup tasted of squash and had a very pleasing velvety texture one expects from a good squash soup. This made for a very good start to her dinner. My taste of it had me agreeing with her, it was quite good. The best part of the Ploughman was the salad by far, it left me wanting that as a side salad for my steak.  I don't know that I would order the Ploughman again but there are a few other apps I would like to try on our next visit.

For our mains GF had the \"Seared Day Boat Scallop\" dinner and I had the steak special with gorgonzola fries. Her 3 large scallops came on bed of lentils with a chive beurre blanc and seasonal veg. Scallops were well cooked and well seared but on the salty side for her, I tend to like things on the salty side and I found them a slight touch on the salty side but still ok for my taste. The lentils with the chive beurre blanc were amazing, such a delightful flavour and I'm usually not the biggest fan of lentils but if they all tasted like that.......... The veg was veg. Good so nuf said. (same for my plate so again nuf said). My steak came perfectly cooked and nicely seasoned. The fries were so crisp they made me happy. There was a lot of gorgonzola on my fries which turned out to be a great thing cause the zola was sooo good topping the steak.

The maple brulee had a perfect sugar top, nice and crisp without being thick and hard and the custard was delightful with the right amount of maple flavour coming through without being overpowering as maple can so often be. 

All in all a very nice evening.....................Will definitely return."}
{"text":"We went there at 6 pm on a Tuesday. Was quiet, but that is to be expected at this time/day of the week.

The food was excellent. We ordered to Omnivores Ploughman's platter for an appetizer. She had the scallops, and I had the pork porterhouse.

I found the pork to be a tad salty, but still enjoyed the meal.

For dessert I had the Carrot cake, which was excellent and not too sweet.

I was surprised and delighted to hear that they had Muskoka Dark on tap. One of my favourite beers."}
{"text":"Now, lets say, this is the first time I went to Veritas, and for context, it was St. Patrick's day, so I was drinking, but to be honest, they have the BEST onion rings in all of Toronto.  I will stake my reputation on it.  On top of that the burger was extremely tasty.

I would recommend this place at any time."}
{"text":"I love how many fine-dining restaurants are including vegan options in Toronto these days. I have tried the vegan burger a few times; it's delicious and unique. It's not your typical \"veggie burger\". It's actually a mix of mashed veggies wrapped in a grilled tortilla. The 'mashed' inside is pinkish from the beets. It sounds weird but it's soooo good! I should warn you that they change their menu often to try and make the menu 100% local food (which i admire). The vegan burger seems to stay on the menu though. They also have sweet potato fries and salad to go with the burger. 

I have to admit I've never actually dined in the restaurant (there is a recording studio above so i've had their food up there). I also can't comment on price because i've never had to pay for my meal. It is fine-dining so expect slightly higher price range."}
{"text":"We've been wanting to try Veritas for years! Why it's taken so long, I'm not sure, but we've lived around the corner for 4 years now, so our first visit was long overdue!

We went in a group of 6 on a Saturday night during Winterlicious. Our past experiences with Winterlicious Saturday nights had our expectations down for this meal, but Veritas delivered across the board!

Among the 6, we tried dishes from the regular menu and the Winterlicious and weren't disappointed with anything. There was a clear winner though, and that was the fried chicken!! Dipped in buttermilk and drizzled with honey sums it up nicely! Perfectly fried, the two huge pieces were more than enough for all.

As I mentioned, the other dishes were said to be excellent, but we had a hard time not talking about the fried chicken!! So much so that the chef, Brad, came out so we could compliment him personally.

Very nice touch, and very much in line with the overall attitude from Veritas, which was exemplified by our excellent server, Anne. She made us feel at home from the first minute and was exceptionally friendly and helpful. It should be noted that the fried chicken was her suggestion!

Back to the food for a second, their tag line is Local Fare, but they're not militant about it, which is a nice change. They work hard to build seasonal menus and source out to sustainable farms when possible.

All in all, I would recommend Veritas for just about any occasion. It's perfect for groups, first dates, anniversaries, birthdays or just a nice night out. 

If - like us - you've always wanted to try it, stop heistating and call now!!"}
{"text":"I went on Friday night with my fiance for a \"date.\".  We had their daily flat bread to start, he had the top sirloin steak , I had the beef cheek pierogies and we split their charcuterie plate (venison salami... YUM) for dessert.

Everything was lovely.  The steak was cooked perfectly and the veggies with it were done really nicely, had a hint of lemon on whatever they put on them.  The pierogies were amazing. 

Only complaint was the initial appetizer took a bit long but after that things came through quickly.

All the food was very unique tasting, different, fresh, vibrant flavours and the service was lovely."}
{"text":"I just moved into the neighbourhood and found this gem of a place.  I had lunch with a friend and I was not disappointed with the food and service.  We shared the sumptuous and decadent poutine with duck confit.  HEAVENLY!!!! Why does something so good have to end???  My friend had the meaty beef burger with bacon, which had enough gravity to be a sought after burger, sans the undulating smattering of grease expected from a great burger.  I had the fried chicken which was textbook perfect with a side of herbed biscuit and smoked in-house ketchup.  delightful and totally worth the calories.  Our server was engaged and very friendly.  I am so happy this is just a short walk from my home.  I am coming back here again and again!!!  Veritas is indeed the truth when it comes tp simple and delicious food!"}
{"text":"My first time to Veritas, I didn't even want to go there.  Sadly, I didn't even know the place existed.  During the Euro 2008 tournament, Betty's pub (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/bettys-toronto) became the place to watch all the games that concerned Holland.  So anyone of the Dutch persuasion (and there appear to be a goodly number of us) would pack into Betty's to watch the team go through the tournament (Side note: Effing Russians).

On what would turn out to be the last game (again, effing Russians), we were told that Betty's was filled to capacity.  The sadness became somewhat mitigated when we were told that we wouldn't have to go off and infect other bars across the city in close proximity with oranje jerseys.  Veritas was opening to control the overflow.  Heck, it even had an oranje door.  Hallelujah.

The place is very upscale and has a decent number of taps to wet the whistle.  Now, admittedly bowling pins had more breathing space than we all did in this place, but the food came out quickly to feed whoever so ordered.  Not necessarily football-oriented pub food, but why should it be?  We're the guests intruding here.  Great freshness of flavour and good plating for something as simple as nachos.  It's the type of place that I'd revisit even without Holland playing."}
{"text":"It's definitely worth keeping your eyes open to find this restaurant that you would walk right by, if you didn't know it was there.  If you're lucky enough to find it, the food is terrific.

From the moment you walk into the dark-wood floor, 2-level restaurant, the bar on the left is a great place to have a drink if you're waiting for a table, or just to talk.

I was there for a birthday party, and Veritas was able to please everyone with their fantastic buttermilk chicken, steak, mashed potatoes, grilled vegetables and truffles.

Anne, the server, was great, and they even got down the part about filling up your water glass without you noticing or having to ask.

There really wasn't a downside to the whole experience for me, and I'd definitely recommend making a reservation and having a terrific dinner."}
