{"text":"I really tried to give you a chance. I showed up at your store to stock up on meals twice today. Noon and 4pm. Both times the doors were locked, lights out, nobody answering the phones. No sign on the door explaining what was up. And you're supposed to be open until 7pm. This is no way to run a business."}
{"text":"I went in today for lunch thinking this place seemed like a good idea. It is touted as a healthy place and they label their food with designations for things like vegetarian and gluten free. Well I was shocked to find the only thing they had that was vegetarian was a snack pack with 4 Apple slices, 3 celery slices, some crackers and a little serving of almond butter. Everything else had meat, including the salads. How hard is it to make a salad and leave out the meat? I asked the worker if I was just missing the veggie options and she said no, the only one the have is an omelet. So she didn't get that many vegetarians don't eat eggs. My husband had a chicken salad and I had the snack pack with a Greek yogurt. When we finished we were surprised they had no recycling containers. Everything is packaged in plastic containers, why wouldn't you have a plastic recycling? This was a very disappointing lunch. We carried home our used containers to recycle and will not be back. Really I'm amazed a \"healthy\" food place has no vegetarian options."}
{"text":"I agree with the posting that reported very high sodium and other not so good nutritional components to their meals. At first glance this seemed as if it would be a great, fast option to cooking, but not so. Expensive and usually not organic. Fruit with pesticides are not on my choice list."}
{"text":"I know several people who have all tried My Fit Foods.  The unanimous review from everyone, including myself, was that the food was bland and overpriced."}
{"text":"What an amazing idea! The food was outstanding, portioned, and super convenient! I WILL be back.   Joe was super helpful, friendly, and knowledgeable about the company! We enjoyed great conversation and great food! Thanks Joe!"}
{"text":"Good selection and fresh foods. Some meals are better than others, but most are tasty! I'd suggest more vegetarian options and add some other fish choices as well. Also, would like to see the menu change monthly instead of quarterly. We're weekly customers and would love more variety!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent and very filling. I would recommend this place to anyone who is looking for easy, on the go healthy eating."}
{"text":"The foods tastes good, but I track my macros strictly (calories, proteins and fats). The label on my meal for dinner (chicken parmesan)  said 251g total, so I was curious and weighed it.. it came out to be over 300g total. That is 200+ calories more than the label says. It was like this for my other meals too. I am very disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food. Perfect for easy meal after your gym workout. Have been using for a few year and help keep the weight down."}
{"text":"Tons of pros..only one con, which is so minimal it won't cause me to take a star away. The food is legit! Not only that it is helping me with portion control. Not to mention it has helped me lose 12 lbs in 8 weeks, may not sound like a lot but I wasn't what most call fat. I was 140lbs but my fat ratio was horrible. Their food has helped my body increase its lean muscle and I couldn't be happier! If I could find a complaint, which is hard, I wish they would give a discount when you buy so many meals. I buy 10 meals at a time for the week but pay full price. If they could give a discount based on the number of meals you buy, then I would I give them 6 stars!"}
{"text":"I was in the neighborhood and decided to stop by for a quick bite - not knowing anything about it. Having been the previous locations of Dish and The Kitchen, I thought it would be something similar... but was surprised to see it was more of a take out / healthy tv dinner concept. I got a great little intro to the place from the staff and purchased their turkey meatloaf/mashed sweet potato recommendation and warmed it up there... YUM! My only hesitation was that the packaging was in plastic... and microwaving plastic just doesn't seem healthy. The prices are reasonable and if you are looking for glutton free - there are a ton of options... however it would be nice if they explored different packaging... maybe the paper boxes? I'd go again for the food, but may opt to bring home and warm up on a plate or in glass..."}
{"text":"I tried this place twice.  Three different meals each time.  Tasty enough but not organic and not enough vegetarian options.  Really not my kind of place for every day eating.  For those who love meat and don't care about it not being organic, you will be happy."}
{"text":"This is a great place to grab preparers meals for a few days. The meals are nutritional and satiating. A few of my favorites are the shrimp and grits, chicken nuggets, pancakes, lettuce wraps, and chili. I am excited to try some of the new items they have created."}
{"text":"Helpful staff and very knowledgeable. Love how the food is packaged especially for those days when I'll be eating alone. Or, when I just want to eat differently. Food is fresh and not the run of the mill frozen diet food entre."}
{"text":"Very friendly and helpful staff. The concept is fantastic for my lifestyle. The food is great. As previously mentioned, it is pricey, but it is quality healthy food. Keep up the great work and I'll continue to frequent."}
{"text":"After busy doing our scuba certs all weekend, there is nothing better than prepping for or week with the delicious MY FIT FOODS meals! So much variety and so easy for busy weeks. We love my fit foods !!!"}
{"text":"I have been trying to eat healthy lately and My Fit Foods has really helped my cause.  Plenty of diverse healthy and delicious options.  My only complaint is that My Fit Foods is a little pricey."}
{"text":"Love this place! Food tastes good, and it's healthy and convenient. They spell out how many calories and protein is in each dish. I also like that you can get a coupon though Yelp to use on your order!"}
{"text":"Healthy, delicious food! Many choices to choose from for breakfast lunch or dinner. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Good food ..good times! Only complaint I had is if you go in with a group of 6 why wouldn't they just let you sit with your group vs having 2 strangers sitting with you. We had a great time but it was frustrating how they had everyone slide around 2 sit the 2 group in the middle and split ours up. But it was still great experience."}
{"text":"My wife and I started  the 21 day challenge after Thankgiving. We both loved all the meals and the snacks in between. This was the first time I've  ever dieted and I also started exerciseing and lifting weights for the first time. I initially wanted to start on the program not because I had a lot of weight to lose, but I wanted to get in a routine of eating healthy and avoiding the junk food. I feel so much better and have a lot more energy. I lost 11lbs. in the first three weeks and my wife lost 10lbs. Since finishing the challenge I've lost an additional 9lbs. I plan on continueing to eat heathy and exercising . It really is a lifestyle ! My wife and I plan on continueing to visit the store for our favorite meals and my chocolate protein shake.Thanks to Leah and the staff at My Fit Foods, they were very helpful with our questions and with any concerns we had. Love you guys, you changed our lives forever !!!"}
{"text":"5/6/16  I absolutely love this place! Variety of options of healthy & delicious meals for my super busy on the go lifestyle! Great staff and a super convenient location in Ahwatukee. Thx much!! ;)  -E. McLaurin"}
{"text":"I may never cook again!  I went in to pick up lunch for today and got so excited to see whole food, gluten free, all ready prepared and fresh that I left with 7 meals for $50.00!   All the employees were so nice and helpful!  I spoke to several personnel and they were all well educated on their products and services.  Thanks for your great attitudes!"}
{"text":"I'm a very busy profession that lacks time to cook healthy meals. My fit foods is a perfect solution for me! It has been a life saver. The meals are perfectly portioned and taste great!"}
{"text":"They closed thier doors without any notice. No statement of it closing, no answering machine. What happened"}
{"text":"What a great concept MFF is. I ate the food at the Scottsdale location on and off for about a year. Not everyday, but frequently enough to say I was a regular. The menu never changed and I was ok with that - healthy food comes at a cost, and it doesn't always taste great. The results are what matter. After a year I was so burnt out, I could no longer force the bland meals down. I had a few favorites that I would come back to, but overall there wasn't much change.  Then I went to MFF in Southlake, Texas this past Christmas. The meals were great and I was excited that they changed the menu and added some new items.  Fast forward to this week. I had some of those same new items at the Scottsdale location. The Pork Tacos were so tough, fatty and overcooked that I threw away the whole meal. Angry. The corn tortillas are rock hard after you microwave them. Absolutely pathetic food.  I was also disappointed that the breakfast staple \"Good Morning Sunshine\" had been changed. She told me they now add tomato sauce to the ground turkey. Terrible idea.  I've decided that the chefs at the Scottsdale location use low quality ingredients and don't cook up to the standard of other MFF locations.  Time to try Sunfare here in AZ."}
{"text":"Sign says open lights are on but door is locked. Closed? Second time I've stopped by. Glad I didn't have a order to pick up!!"}
{"text":"As soon as I walked in,  someone was available to help me choose meal options.  I chose the Asian flat iron steak as well as several breakfast options and snacks.  Food was flavorful, fresh and well prepared.  Especially good option when you need a meal for one or two.   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The manager at the store is amazingly helpful and full of energy and life that makes you want to come back to that store again and again"}
{"text":"This place works if you do not have time to prepare healthy means for yourself. We have ordered 3 times. The common theme is spicy with little flavor. Most dishes I had have been spicy or heavy on the garlic. The portion sizes are small which can help you manage your weight if you still to the meal plan."}
{"text":"I have been a customer for a little over a year the staff is great and the food is amazing.  I have never been very good at making sound food choices in my diet, My Fit  Foods came highly recommended by my trainer.  I started by completing their 21 Day Challenge and I have been hooked every since.  They make it easy to eat healthy and delicious meals, they even have a few \"healthy\" desert alternatives if you are like me and have a sweet tooth. They change up some of their meals every few months if you get bored with eating the same thing."}
{"text":"First off, I would like to say that I was kinda upset at myself that it took me 12 days (out of 14) to discover this place.   I walked in about 10 minutes before they closed, I hate doing this but I was starving. The 2 young ladies were more than helpful and willing to stay open a little later for me.   I am currently enjoying the Paleo diet. If you don't know about it look it up. But it is kinda a pain to do when you are traveling. OK its a huge pain. This store though helped me out. Wish I would have found it earlier.   They cater there food to different diet restrictions, paleo, gluten free... you get the gist.   The have all meals covered, breakfast, lunch and dinner. I didn't think that I would be full with the large portion so I purchased the large and medium. It was a wise choice. I took home (hotel room)some pork and some chicken. Popped them in the micro and BAM hot food!   If you can eat anywhere or anything, this might not be your best stop. BUT if your looking for ready made Paleo food...STOP HERE!!!"}
{"text":"I've been ordering my meals here for weeks now since I moved to the Phoenix area and I just love it. They make it so easy for a busy professional to stay on track and eat healthy.  All of the food tastes amazing and I have my favorites. The employees at the Ray location and awesome and always helpful. While its convenient to walk in and get what you want, as a regular it's better to pre-order so you are guaranteed your favorites. The breakfast tacos and H-Town are must tries! Thank you for making amazing food and helping me reach my healthy goals!"}
{"text":"I came in yesterday for the first time, and must say the staff are extremely friendly and personable. I like the concept and idea of freshly pre-made healthy food on the go. I had forgotten all my food at home, and pass by this place daily on my way to work so thought it was a great idea to stop in and grab my meals.   Since I am training for something at the moment, I do count my macros. I had asked one of the gals how many ounces of chicken is in the small meal and she firmly told me the chicken is 4 oz and the medium meal I was looking at has 6 oz of chicken. I had purchased both the small and medium, and when I got to work and opened up the small there was only two thin slices of chicken, so I opened the medium and it had only four thinly sliced chicken. Both weighing less than four ounces of protein... I was a bit disappointed and kinda bummed there was way more squash and zucchini than the meat itself. I wish I would've known!   Fortunately I did use a 20% discount so I didn't pay the full price, but I am a bit bummed I was misinformed. And in no way do I want any of those gals to get in trouble for this post, I just thought sharing my thoughts would hopefully guide employees to better inform customers about how many ounces or slices of chicken/protein is in the meals.   Three stars because of how good the food was. I did absolutely enjoyed both meals, it just wasn't meeting my expectations for the price."}
{"text":"If you don't have time to do meal preparation but also don't want to fill your freezer with Lean Cuisine, this is a place for you. They provide pre-made meals that you just need to warm up and eat. You can either eat at the store or you can take them with you and eat at your home or work.  It's a great concept but unfortunately it didn't pass the taste test for me. Nothing bad, just kind of boring. Of course your opinion may vary."}
{"text":"Friendly and knowledgeable staff! They even have a nutritionist on site which shows their dedication to promote healthy living! I think it's great that they make the food daily and have appropriate portion sizes.  I gave it only 4 stars instead of 5 because they didn't have as many vegetarian/vegan meals as I would have liked. What I did purchase though tasted delicious! I look forward to going back and checking out their meals again!"}
{"text":"I visited the other location in Scottsdale the other day for lunch. I'm in town for an army class, and this place suited all of my nutritional needs for the week. Way less expensive this eating out all day, and WAY better on my tummy. Food was great. Staff was super awesome!"}
{"text":"Where has this place been my whole life?! I'm here for army duty for a week.... Eating out isn't my thing. At all. My dumb stomach is sensitive to everything. I try to follow a paleo lifestyle, some carbs are ok for me..this place is a godsend for travelers. The first meal I purchased (almond crusted chicken) was awesome. I didn't eat the Yukon gold potato mash it came with but purchased some sweet potato mash on the side. Everything was awesome. The green beans were crisp, chicken was perfect, sweet potato mash was so dang good. Got a couple snacks too. Great selection. I'll be back the remainder of the week to get my meals. Awesome spot for me!!"}
{"text":"I would like to write a good review, because the idea is tremendous - being able to purchase convenient \"healthy\" foods vs. fast foods is an awesome idea, but I think there is much room for improvement here.   I received coupons for this store, and decided to visit.  I am pre-diabetic, and attempting to avoid foods with hidden sugars.  I was extremely dismayed to see that sugar is listed as an ingredient on virtually every item in the store, even those that have no reason to taste sweet.  This aspect is no different than a trip to any chain grocery store.   I did end up purchasing as a buy one get on 50% off (with coupon) the Protein Pack, which contains two pieces of chicken, a handful of baby carrots, a hard boiled egg and a small container of hummus on Saturday, June 27, 2015.   The \"sell by\" date is 7/1/15.   On Monday, 6/29/15, I brought one to work for a snack.  It was fine - the type of food I have been trying to eat in order to lower my blood sugar.  However, on Tuesday 6/30/15, when I opened the second one, all the items (chicken, hard-boiled egg and carrots) were starting to turn slimy.  I wiped them off with a napkin and was able to eat them, but this was an experience that will serve as a deterrent to my returning and purchasing this item again.  And since all of the other items contain sugar in some form, I will not be a customer unless at some future point there are more items offered without sugar.   On a different note, I returned on Sunday with a friend to see whether she was interested in any of the items since I had more coupons.      She picked up a package containing salmon, and asked whether it was wild-caught or farm raised.  The sales associate said, \"oh, it's definitely farm raised, which is the best.  I eat it all the time and really enjoy it.\"  Seriously?  Google any information on farm-raised salmon and the advice is:  \"avoid.\"  As I said before, this is an excellent idea, and I would love to see more available alternatives to fast food restaurants - I just feel that there is a lot of room for improvement here."}
{"text":"Great place to grab good healthy food when you don't want to have to cook! I love the snacks with the apples and crackers, they are so good!!!!"}
{"text":"The customer service here is great! Everyone is there to answer any questions, give recommendations, and help you pick out what is good for you. It was my first time so I got a couple things from the breakfast and lunch. I got the \"Good Morning Sunshine\" breakfast- wow it was great, I will get many more. The Ginger Sesame bowl- it was so delicious, I didn't read it had no meat in it, but it was still good!   I got two of the overnight oats, the carrot cake and cherry chia... We both couldn't finish ours, we personally did not like them at all. They tasted off- almost sour after taste, I can't really describe it other than gross. I wont get those again but I will be back for sure to try them out!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I walked in later in the day on Sunday and was greeted and promptly Helped! And the food tastes amazing."}
{"text":"Pretty awesome business concept. Sell pre-packaged ready to heat up and eat food that is low calorie and good for you as well as great tasting!!  The menu is pretty impressive and have meals for breakfast, lunch and dinner as well as snacks. There are at least 4-5 different selections per meal ranging from 250 to 600 calories. Everything I've ever eaten here was absolutely delicious!! They pre-cook and package right on site and use spices to keep down on the sodium.   You can purchase and eat your food on site, purchase and take with you  or order online. they also do catering which is brilliant for the health conscious groups.   Every time i have been here the staff is wonderful and will help answer any question you have. They are courtroues and friendly as well.  My only complaint is that the menu doesn't change much at all. The 2 times i came were 6 months apart and they had (from what i could tell) the exact same items. now these are all great items just would be nice to see a change in the menu every couple weeks to keep people interested.   will be back when I'm in town and hoping to see a franchise in Indy sometime!!"}
{"text":"I can't possibly say one bad thing about this place.  I have been going here for 6 months or so now and I don't know what I would do without it! My husband is equally as obsessed.  It takes some time to figure out what you love and don't love and I even find myself on a \"kick\" of eating certain meals because it's THAT good! I know some people have an issue with the price but I couldn't make this food at home for the price of a MFF meal (trust me I have tried).  I either throw away uneaten portions, get sick of the same thing over and over again or just can't get it flavorful enough while still keeping it clean, low cal and gluten free.    Make sure you try to My Fit Cocktail! I am drinking it as I type this review :)   Since I have started eating gluten free I have had ZERO sinus issues, my autoimmune condition has cleared up and I have lost about 5 pounds.  Try a 21 day challenge and you will never go back!"}
{"text":"This place is great...i was skeptical at first, because i thought \"microwavable\" would suck! however i gave the place a chance & i've been eating these great already portioned tasty meals for the past 2 weeks..  The food has alot of flavour & i'm so surprised it still tastes so good in the microwave..this is perfect for bachelors, people on the go, or trying to manage their weight.  Service is excellent as well. Love the concept!"}
{"text":"Okay, this place is amazing. Healthy meals,  gluten-free options, decent portions and you can choose small, medium or large size. Calories right on the packaging. Cut up portions, microwavable containers.  I love this because at work I sometimes have very brief breaks so I can eat the \"snack\" portions and then eat a lunch or dinner when I have more time. Great concept, reasonable prices and the food is prepared right there on the other side of a glass wall. Clean prep area so you know what you are getting.  I'm just mad I discovered this place now after driving by it for a year. Stop in and check it out. They have a 21 day challenge you can take also."}
{"text":"Great awesome fantastic what else can I say. I started getting all of my food breakfast lunch and dinner plus snacks in February now two months or so later I am down 30 pounds and my blood pressure is way down also. Good healthy food and great people what more can you want?"}
{"text":"Great service, great food. I've never stuck to a diet so easily. Sunday I pickup meals for M-F and just stick to the plan. It's that simple. Weekends I make an effort to eat \"clean\" so far it's working great"}
{"text":"I couldn't tell what this place was exactly from the storefront's appearance and name so curiosity got the best of me and I finally went in today.  Great concept!  The woman inside was very nice and helpful in explaining the program to me.  I bought 3 meals to take home and try:  Butternut Pork, Forbidden Chicken and Herb Roasted Chicken.  The pork and the Herb Roasted Chicken both came with the same vegetables; carrots and zucchini.    My honest opinion??  Not good.  Even with BBQ sauce on the chicken and the veggies...I did not enjoy.  The chicken had a strange 'old' taste and the veggie had no detectable seasoning on them.  They were very bland and strangely, seemed to have absorbed whatever the strange 'old' taste was from the chicken.  The pork had the same weird taste and bland veggies.  I did not enjoy this either.    The broccolini and rice from the Forbidden Chicken meal were ok.  But the chicken was the exact same as the Herb Roasted, same exact seasoning.  Again, did not enjoy.  I feel confident that the other meals must be better than these because if they all tasted this way, noone would eat here.  Again, I love the concept, and the woman inside was very nice.  I think the prices are ok too, provided the food is fresh, seasoned and enjoyable.  But what I tried tonight was very hard to swallow.    I am hopeful that I can go back tomorrow and discuss my troubles with someone understanding who might let me 'exchange' the yucky stuff and try some other options.  I understand that every business has a bad day once in a while.    I really do want to be able to enjoy this place.  Hopefully I can change my rating to a better one!  We'll see!"}
{"text":"This place will give you a pre-packaged meal with about the same amount and quality of food as a frozen diet meal. And just like a diet meal, it shows the calorie count, and nutrition info. Only instead of paying about two dollars for a healthy choice or smart one's meal, they charge closer to nine dollars. I thought it was a rip off. The food tastes a lot like a tv dinner. And I was turned off by the fact that they offer to microwave it for you. I will not be returning to spend nine bucks on a one of their overpriced tv dinners."}
{"text":"i walked in this morning for some breakfast before work and literally stood there for 10 minutes, the guy was in the back and i know he heard the bell from the door. but he never came out to help me. i just walked out after standing there like a doof for 10 minutes and never got any breakfast. just lovely!"}
{"text":"This place is GREAT!  People here are friendly and helpful.  I'm always greeted with a smile, and if I have any questions, they are ready and able to answer.  It's a small store with food in the fridge that was obviously prepared with care and attention.  The food is divided up into meals; breakfast, lunch and dinner.  It is fresh, tasty and will satisfy you with a variety of  choices.  As a vegetarian, I too have many choices and always feel as if I've had a gourmet meal, not just  boring stuff I would slap together for myself. ( There is plenty  variety for the carnivore too!)The prices are very, very reasonable, and very affordable.    I also bought some snack bars with low calories and high on taste.  These were probably less expensive than bars you would normally get in larger stores, and they are better quality as far as calories and nutrition go.   I have often thought of visiting each morning and buying three meals a day just to stay healthy. It' would probably be less expensive than all that I spend at Fry's.  I HIGHLY recommend My Fit Foods.."}
{"text":"My Fit Foods is all about health! I came in for the first time in a couple of years to grab some meals for clean eating after my mean workout the other day. New meals and new 'color coding' , which is indicative of size. The meals at My Fit Foods are fresh made daily, clean , low fat, and low carb. They can customize meal plans for revamping ones diet. I love this location, but they do run out of meals, which makes sense considering that the meals are freshly made. Solve that problem by ordering online or calling ahead for a quick pick up! Everything from breakfasts like Flippin' Pancakes, ( gluten free pancakes with mixed berry compote and a side of chicken maple sausage / 320 cals); lunches like Spinach & Chicken Enchiladas topped with a yummy tomatillo salsa, cheese and beans/360cals for the small and 540 cals large ; dinners that include actual beef tenderloin that's TENDER or tacos!! Freshly made designer type salads loaded with proteins in them averaging 200-400calories. You can grab snacks...yogurts, water, juices ... mainly, I like fresh, clean, calorie and low carb meals that you can grab and go! I love when I am flying that I can take four days of meals in a bag with me on my trips and not blow my diet in one redeye! I'll save that for when I land in Roma.. Thanks My Fit Foods you are a savior for the clean / health conscious eater!"}
{"text":"I still love My Fit Foods. This place is a FRESH food concept different than any other around, & yes, that does mean another Fresh place with foods costing nearly the same. The difference here is, that the food is made fresh and take a look... The ingredients are not processed! It's not a sodium-laden frozen food meal you grab at a grocery store and it lasts into next year, this actually is clean-eating. For those of us who care about what we put into our bodies or with serious allergies, that's very important. Tonight I brought my boyfriend here to stock up on the next five days of meals. Why? Well, because we need a little revamping of our diets and why not get back to clean eating and doing what is good for the body? No. A frozen lean cuisine isn't as good for you as you think; read the label:) What I love, besides that it's made fresh , and local, is that you can order and pick it up when your ready and they will adhere to any allergy or dietary needs that you have. Kombucha !!"}
{"text":"Just completed the 21 day challenge today, and I've been dying to write this review! I walked in 21 days ago, intending to just grab a healthy lunch after a friend told me about My Fit Foods. It took me about 5 minutes to be sold on the food (it's stuff I would normally eat anyway!), so I decided to press the easy button and sign up with Molly. This was probably the best decision of my life.   I am reasonably fit, not considered overweight, and was hoping to lose only 8 lbs. so my clothes would fit better. I have struggled with blood sugar issues, adult acne, sluggishness, and anxiety my whole life but it had gotten particularly bad in the past 6 months. So you could say that I was meant to walk into this place when I did.  On the 21 day challenge, you eat 3 meals a day plus 2 snacks so you are NEVER hungry. At least I wasn't. In fact, it's quite an adjustment to eat on a 3 hour schedule consistently. There were two times where I had to be away from a microwave or whatever for dinner, so I heated up my meals hours earlier and put them in a thermos. I did this for the turkey chili and happily gobbled it up at NYPD while my family chowed down on pizza.  I found the food to be quite tasty, and much of it spicy which I like. I could eat this food the rest of my life and not feel like I'm missing out. But again, I was a pretty healthy eater to begin with.  My results from the 21 day challenge:  * I had really bad caffeine withdrawals the first 5-7 days (no caffeine or alcohol on the plan), not fun. Might want to pare down the caffeine slowly prior to embarking on the 21 day challenge. No alcohol wasn't an issue for me, I just drank caffeine free tea. * I lost 6.5 lbs, my goal was 8. This was my fault though, because my cheat meals (you are permitted 1 per week) were way overboard. One of them I did a full-on tasting and wine pairing (remember, you're not supposed to drink alcohol for the 21 days!)  I'm just going to continue for a couple more days until I get to my goal. * My nasal allergies totally stopped. I've had TWO sinus surgeries for chronic sinusitis. This was totally crazy and unexpected, and makes me think that I have food allergies or sensitivities that I need to get tested. I shudder to think I could've avoided two sinus surgeries in 5 years by changing my diet. * My acne is GONE. Totally gone. I wonder if it was the dairy I was drinking/eating before?  * My shakiness, night sweats, anxiety, and heart palpitations related to blood sugar fluctuations are completely gone. * I am WAY calmer with my kids! I really think the caffeine increased my cortisol/stress hormone levels through the roof. You don't realize how dependent you are until you go through withdrawals. * This is probably the strangest one and too-much-information, but my PMS disappeared too. I searched diet changes & PMS and found that everything that is suggested to ease PMS symptoms are in this diet (reduce caffeine, low fat diet, keep blood sugar stable, take B vitamins). It never even occurred to me that diet & PMS were related. * I wake up in a good mood and ready to start the day. I have never been a morning person, especially without caffeine. I am addicted to the Fit Foods morning drink (cranberry juice, water, 1/2 squeezed lemon, 1-2 oz liquid B-12, apple cider vinegar). I will drink it the rest of my life!  I can't thank you enough Molly & My Fit Foods!"}
{"text":"This is a great way to keep your calories and weight under control.  This is like weight watchers and other diet programs that get mailed to your house with one major difference they have fresh food in a cooler for you to pick up.  The food was fresh and looked great.  You can talk to a wellness coach  and start a 21 day plan.  The staff was great and friendly.  The coolers had several things missing like green drinks.  I will return when i visit again."}
{"text":"My fit foods 48th and Ray has the best prepped healthy meals!  So excited i found this place"}
{"text":"At first I thought this would be a good alternative to frozen microwave meals, like Lean Cuisine.  I rationalized that I would be eating freshly prepared meals that were good for me, without having to prepare anything.  After eating the prepared dishes at every meal, for several days in a row, I noticed I was craving water in massive amounts.  I literally could not stop drinking water. I realized that the only thing that was different was the food from My Fit Foods.  So, I actually sat down and read the nutrition label for some of the things I bought.  Every dish was sky high in sodium!  One dish was supposed to constitute 70% of my daily intake of sodium and 30% of my daily intake of cholesterol.  I was floored.  I thought the dishes were healthy.  While many of them have good fats, are high in protein, and have decent amounts of fiber, there are TONS that are loaded with sodium, cholesterol, and saturated fats. Be very careful when you choose what dishes to buy.  The prices are also extremely high.  Additionally, I think most of the meals are much too spicy (I'm convinced that the over abundance of spices is to cover up bland flavor).  If you decide that you absolutely have to order food from them, go online and click on the low sodium tab to see their choices for low sodium dishes.  There are only a few choices, but it would be a shame to lose weight and then develop a heart condition later on."}
{"text":"Poor service today. I grab their 1lb pre cooked ground turkey weekly. They were out today, which is fine. Asked if they would have more tomorrow and the guy at the counter said he couldn't go back to ask while they were prepping. This means one of two things, either a chef who is a tyrant, or just pure laziness and lack of service for the consumer. Go above and beyond, take my number to let me know when it's here, shoot, use that to add my phone number to your database and market to me. Own your business! Won't be going back here again. Service is 100% my decision on where I get my prepped meals in a saturated market."}
{"text":"Food has little to no flavor and you pay for convenience I guess and packaging but Id say going weekly to Whole foods and getting containers of quality foods and mix and match would be cheaper and easier.   Good concept though.  Much success but Im gonna pass."}
{"text":"Great place for good food. Convenient but a little pricey. With convenience comes price so its totally worth it. Staff is always friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Super health minded prepared meals and snacks.  Worthy of a stop in for any person short on time and big on health."}
{"text":"A wonderful idea for a fit person on the go or just someone who wants to eat a good meal. Affordable - great portions, and a super friendly and helpful staff every time. Thank you Chaz and Ida!"}
{"text":"I have recently been diagnosed with whey and egg intolerance and that makes eating out difficult, especially at lunch time on a busy work day.  Tired of the same old salads at Trader Joe's I called this place up to ask what they could offer me.  Ashley assisted in planning both mine and my boss' lunch menu for the remainder of the week.  The first meals we ate: salmon cakes with asparagus for my boss and butternut pork with veggies for me.  My boss was impressed with the quality of the salmon cakes which he promptly inhaled.  I thoroughly enjoyed my butternut pork and veggies.  Both only took 2 minutes to warm up in the microwave and I can definitely say that I am very happy with the quality, the flavor and the options. I did, however, contact the company to find out their allergen information and received it within the hour of e mailing them.  With a handy dandy little list in hand I will definitely be adding this place to my list of healthy dining options for lunch."}
{"text":"Eating this reminded me of the time where I cared deeply about my body fat % and was super strict with what I ate...... good times.  I was happy to revisit this time as we were on an extended stay in AZ and I didn't want to blow up like the Grand Canyon by eating out every night.   The set up is easy to navigate and it was nice that the woman who worked there gave us a run down.   They make the food fresh each day and weigh out the portions so you know exactly what you are eating and how many total calories you are consuming.  All the meals/snacks are between ~200 to ~600 calories and are organized in refrigerators by meal of the day (breakfast, lunch, snack, dinner) and size (small and regular). The containers they come in are microwaveable and can be frozen.   So far I have tried their Protein Pack, Herb Roasted Chicken Breast, and Shredded Beef Tacos.  All were good and I would get them again.   If you have ever had a bout (or total lifestyle) of \"eating clean\", Paleo, Whole30, or any other structured nutrition program then you will probably like the food.  If not, you might not enjoy it as much."}
{"text":"I love how convenient it is! After my work out, I aim to consume protein within 30 mins and I used to think what to eat for an hour being indecisive. I don't miss my 30 mins rule anymore! It's pretty healthy yet I wish they had a less sodium option. Sodium does bad to the body a lot more than we think."}
{"text":"I was really excited about the concept of this place because as a night nurse it's really difficult to eat healthy and maintain my weight. So I purchased about a weeks worth of meals and decided to give it a try. Unfortunately, the food lacks flavor and two of the dishes gave me food poisoning :/ sad to say I won't be returning. I really wish I could find a place that makes healthy meals that taste good."}
{"text":"The food is very good, but what even better are the people.  I needed their help and Todd the manager step-up and was there for me.  My hat go out to this business for going the extra mile."}
{"text":"Great food and very healthy. I pick up my food Monday and I an good until Friday all meals planned so I don't have to think about cooking healthy. Love this place"}
{"text":"I'm all about healthy eating... most of the time.    I'm also all about enjoying some not-so-healthy splurges on occasion; everything in moderation, right?    And lastly, I'm going on my 38th week of being pregnant, and throughout this pregnancy, I have to admit, I've been extremely time-challenged and not had much desire to cook.    Enter My Fit Foods...  My husband started picking up some meals and snacks from MFF sometime within the last 10 months.  We've actually given them a ton of business, and I'm sure will continue to do so considering we enjoy the quality of their food, the portion sizes, convenience, the service, etc... oh yeah - and the fact that they are healthy too!  Sure, it can be pricey, and I advise only purchasing what you know you'll eat within a few days.  We've had a few instances where the food sits too long and goes past expiration date and goes to waste.  But, when you plan ahead, MFF really is fabulous.  Some of our favorite dishes: *Breakfast: protein pancakes and oat bakes - our toddler loves the pancakes and I love the oat bakes!  *Lunch / Dinner: I enjoy most of the salmon and chicken dishes.  The cobb and/or greek salads aren't bad either.  My husband is also a fan of Denyse's Killuh Chili; I have yet to try it though.  *Snacks: almond butter crunch / fit-to-go  ***I'm not a big fan of the bars or cookies, and I don't recommend the wrap sandwiches either.  I do however love that they sell Chobani yogurt.  It's my favorite but I purchase it at the grocery store.  As soon as this baby arrives and I'm ready to get fit and drop the lbs I've been putting on, I may consider one of MFF's 21 day challenges.  Let me know if you're interested in joining me!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Whenever I know I will be in the area, I try to stop by and pick up a few things or dinner for the evening. It's such a great and healthy alternative to fast food. The food is made fresh and packaged with reheating instructions. I love to cook but sometimes MFF is my saving grace from junk when I am feeling lazy (or if the hub is out of town and I don't want to cook just for myself).  My fave entrees are: Brekkie - anything that they do with oats are phenom--I am a huge oatmeal fan but I think their offerings could sway the most skeptical. I love the good Morning sunshine which is turkey chorizo (it's got a nice spice to it, not for little girls) and egg whites.   Lunch/dinner - love love love the lemon turkey with rice and asparagus (a mere 250 cal entree - perfect for days when I blow my calories on a rich lunch) and the \"killuh\" turkey chili. It's so bomb. I've tried copy cat recipes that come close but I haven't been able to replicate it yet.  They have great snack boxes as well.   I have done the 21 day challenge and my coach was great! And overall I felt sated. I did not lose any weight which was disappointing BUT she had me at 1200 calories a day which for someone as active as I am is definitely not enough. There were even points where I felt like, sh*t I have to eat again.   Overall, like the food and will keep coming back."}
{"text":"I like eating healthy but like good tasting food too. I stopped in to pick up a quick take out lunch. I liked that they had lots of choices for lower calories than most  healthy choice restaurants. And the food was good. Chicken and sweet potato was pretty tasty.  What impressed me most were the women who worked there. Very helpful, courteous and gave real recommendations without being pushy. I felt comfortable asking questions and taking my time to choose.   I  will be back!"}
{"text":"A great option in the area if you're looking for healthy, pre-made meals. They have breakfast, snack, lunch and dinner options. I tried the buffalo chicken wrap as well as the salmon. The buffalo chicken wrap was excellent, but at 300 calories, it was half of a wrap with 5 carrots and a side of bleu cheese dressing. Good if you're on a diet for portion control, but may require more food if you're hungry.  For dinner I had the salmon which was delicious. Just about 2 minutes in the microwave and you're set. This meal, on the other hand, completely filled me up.   Prices range from $5-10 from what I could see. Very cool concept that I'm sure does well!"}
{"text":"We are all about recommending meal planning and prepping to our clients, but also understand that sometimes it just doesn't happen. My Fit Foods gives anyone who wants to live a healthy lifestyle a different option from the usual fast food joints. Our nutrition beliefs are just a little bit different from theirs, so that's the reason for one star missing! Keep up the awesome work and thanks for being available for our FitFam!!"}
{"text":"Ive never been to a place with this concept, and going in i had actually no idea how it really worked. I got there and they layout is super simple but very neat. When I went in I clearly had the most confused look on my face and this super sweet blonde helped me right away. The food was awesome and still tasted amazing after being reheated in the microwave. Not too pricey either!"}
{"text":"I like the concept especially for my daughter who is an athlete and is focusing on eating healthy. The problem is that you still need to read the labels carefully. The omelette has artificial butter?! The protein platter has additives?! Why?? The name Fit Foods implies healthy and artificial flavors and additives are not healthy. If stores like Fresh and Easy can make entrees free of preservatives, artificial flavors, etc. why can't this place? When I mentioned it to the \"nutritionist\" she had no idea. Just like she had no idea the salmon patty had tree nuts and my daughter is allergic. Don't rely on the staff, read the labels. Despite the response from the company the label on the omelet says artificial butter flavor and disodium inosinate is a flavor equivalent to MSG."}
{"text":"My Fit Foods has changed my life!  I hate cooking for one and Laura makes it so easy to order my food for the week.  I save so much time by not cooking and money by not eating out for every meal.  Everyone who works there is pleasant and accommodating.  There has not been a meal that I dislike.  The portion sizes are perfect and filling.  I have lost weight due to the simple fact that the portions are measured out and I am not eating more food than necessary.  There are tons of delectable options.  My only complaint is that I wish there were more locations."}
{"text":"Just discovered my fit foods and for a person who is trying to eat healthy and doesn't have the time to prep and cook this is the perfect place to get your food! They have food for every pallet. I have yet to try a dish that I don't like. I am addicted."}
{"text":"As soon as I saw the sign Fit Food, I was sold. After eating out all week on vacation, I wanted healthy. This place is super rad! It's pick out and go. What a great concept. Good for quick breakfast lunch and even dinner! We all grabbed something different and took to the pool. Lots of options too:-)) My only complaint is there's not one in San Diego!"}
{"text":"I love the business concept and the execution of it. I have eaten a few things here and was overall impressed by the freshness and tastiness of prepackaged meals; especially those that are low in calories (after all isn't that what people come here for, to lose weight?) I recently had their breakfast tacos and they were extremely flavorful and the seasoning on the meat was great too. Now the downside is that they were a bit expensive I mean like $7-8 for small tacos but overall love this place."}
{"text":"We have been getting meals from my fit foods for over a year and have never been disappointed . The food is prepared fresh daily and is delicious. The staff is always friendly and helpful. This place is a must."}
{"text":"I went to visit this store for the first time last night because I was starving and didn't have time to cook dinner. Wow! I was so surprised! This place is the most amazing quick lunch/dinner store I have ever been to.  I got the fresh Salmon and Chicken Fruit Bowl. The salmon was fresh and the chicken fruit bowl had grapefruit and oranges that were delicious.  The big surprise was the salad I got for the next day...Sriracha Chicken Salad. I had to work at the office 11 hours straight and didn't know if I was going to make it without lunch, then I remembered I had bought a salad from My Fit Foods...I opened it and the entire office kept asking me how it was because it smelled so good. Needless to say it got me through the day and saved my energy!"}
{"text":"I started my fit foods last week and loving everything about it.  The food is very tasty and satisfying, no more snacking for me!  The staff, Leah the nutrition coach provided a lot of education and has even checked in with me a few times during the week.  Erinn and Fabiola were so friendly and helpful when I came in to pickup my order.  They asked if there was anything I wanted to replace and were genuinely wanting me to have control in my selection.  So far there has been nothing I wouldn't eat again.  I love the convenience of myfitfoods and having the fresh options. I can't think of a better program out there!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Staff is always ready and eager to help! Can always find something and the meals are always delicious. Definitely helps in a time crunch to not fall back on fast food when you're trying to stay away from it. Everyone should visit!"}
{"text":"I walked in and told the cashier I had never been here before. A customer who over heard me turned around and said this place is great, you will be addicted. I bought a chicken taco bowl for today's lunch and chicken enchiladas for tomorrows lunch (I apparently like Mexican food). Both meals look fabulous and are packaged very nicely. I got back to work and heated the taco bowl up. It was very good. It had lots of flavor and was very fresh. It defiantly did not taste like one of those frozen prepackage meal that I am sure we have all eaten (Healthy Choice, Smart Ones, Lean Cuisine). My only complaint was the price. I feel like 6.95 is a little spendy for the amount of food you get especially when those other pre packaged meals are around $2 a piece. However the whole point of eating fit is portion control. They do have 2 challenges. One is a 3 day challenge for $75 and the other is a 21 day challenge for $500. Each day comes with 2 snacks, breakfast, lunch and dinner. I will not be partaking in the challenges but I would defiantly pick up a meal or 2 during the work week for my lunch. about a minute ago"}
{"text":"Absolutely worth the money. As a teacher and athletic director at a local school I was allowing myself to fall in to the time trap. Teacher's don't have a lot of extra free time for food prep. Fast food and unhealthy snacks were dominating my life.  Enter My Fit Foods with an amazingly easy way for me to get convenience and health into my life.  The downside... it can cost a pretty penny. At least, if you're on a teacher's salary it can. But making this financial sacrifice has allowed me to drop 20 pounds since the beginning of the school year and look more credible when I tell the kids at our school they need to work hard at being fit. Not only that, I'm sleeping better and feeling better about myself. It's worth every penny and the food is good!  Big thanks to the crew at the Ray Rd store for always being friendly and helpful. I enjoy my trip there every time.  i've tried most of the MFF options. I love almost every breakfast food option. I find the lunches to be a bit less exciting but still tasty. I generally enjoy the good morning sunshine, denver omelet, and H-Town as my absolute favorites. Farmhouse steak and eggs is also tasty, just a bit pricey. I don't do the dinners often as the one thing I CAN cook for myself at home is dinner.  Thanks for helping a really busy guy stay in shape!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service, Amazing food! The staff is super friendly, helpful, and supportive. They explain everything to you in great detail and make you feel super comfortable. The food is very good and the place seemed very busy with people coming in and out picking up food. Can't wait to continue with My Fit Foods. A very welcoming environment."}
{"text":"Love the CHILI!!  Everyone is so helpful and the food is fantastic and love the text messages with helpful hints.  Not sure about the pricing...  just started and it seems a bit expensive but need to keep a budget so I know what I would spend on just groceries!  Clean, Friendly, helpful and very tasty!!"}
{"text":"After a busy and exciting first day back in school (last semester in college was seven years ago!), I was hungry and unsuccessful in finding anything interesting near the college.  I decided to find something close to home, but was distracted and missed my exit.  I soon found myself near Gainey Ranch.  I spotted a new restaurant there and decided to check it out, and soon found myself in the parking lot of not where I wanted to go to, but of My Fit Foods.  From the outside, MFF looked like a GNC, or a vitamin shop.  A quick check on the Yelp app confirmed that it was a pre-packaged health food place where I might find something quick to eat.  I went in and headed straight to the refrigerated section to see what everyone else was searching through and found pre-packaged foods from floor-to-ceiling.  There were breakfast items, such as burrito wraps and oatmeal combos, as well as small to large servings of lunch and dinner options, as well as some snack items.  Since these were pre-packaged, I quickly decided I'd have to look for nutritional and ingredients' info online, or I would be taking a lot of someone's precious time investigating for food allergens.  I met Brian, who quickly kept me from leaving, and instead, told me he would help me w/ identifying which foods I would have to stay away from.  A few minutes later, we were left w/ less than two handfuls' of items to choose from-- what a friendly and upbeat guy!  (Qualities of a great salesman.)  He even invited me to take a dish home to try, gratis!    I asked if there was a membership I could sign up for, and he said yes, I could open up a \"house account,\" where for $500, I would save 5% on purchases, whereby giving me $525 to spend however I choose, whenever I choose.  I could walk in and choose the items I wanted, or I could place the order online or by phone, and then come in whenever it's convenient for me (during business hours, that is) to pick up my order.  If I only didn't have so many food allergies to contend with, I think the products here are a convenient way to ensure I eat healthily, following a low-carb 40/40/20 diet, and lose weight, if I choose to.  I must admit that while the tofu, spinach, salsa, and quinoa-stuffed yellow bell pepper meal I tried was bland at the start, after adding a little bit of salt, it was actually quite delicious, and very satisfying!  Thank you for the inspiration on how to prepare a new dish, Brian!    While I may not become a regular customer, I would definitely recommend My Fit Foods to anyone I know who would like to be able to eat healthier and lose weight, and who would not want to, or could not, prepare every meal they eat themselves.  These pre-packaged foods are perfect to take w/ you to work.  Just heat, and eat!    A quick note: There is a nutritionist on-staff, who you may speak with if you have any other concerns that a regular staffer may not be able to address, although Brian was very thorough.  I'm not sure, but I would think that getting a more-personalized menu might be possible.  I'll have to inquire more the next time I stop by to confirm this!"}
{"text":"I love this place!!!!!!!! It's perfect for my lunches and snacks to take to work and not have to worry about prepping my meals for lunch. For me it ends up being much less expensive than grocery shopping and having to make sure your portions are correct. The nutrition coach is very helpful and also realistic with no misguided information. I like the fact that they don't add any artificial preservatives. As far as reading previous reviews It amazes me how dense people are and how misinformed they are about nutrition. Any reason to complain right? Leah the nutrition coach is always smiling, has a lot of energy, in great shape (which is important because she takes care of herself how she is telling others to), and is always telling me if I need anything don't hesitate to call. I would love to have another location more north!  I LOVE MY FIT FOODS!!!"}
{"text":"The food is seriously amazing. Healthy, good fast food is such a rarity. One can eat Subway a few times before you never want to go back. MFF has a nice variety to choose from for any meal. The meal plans are helpful but if you already cook a lot, prolly don't need to do it. I grab a few lunch meals and keep them in my work fridge for the week."}
{"text":"I received a BOGO coup in the mail and decided to give this place a shot. The storefront seemed larger than necessary but it was clean and well organized. I told the girl that it was our first time and she gave us the spiel on how things were organized. After looking around, I selected the salmon. I ate it the next day. The salmon was a little fishy to my liking but it wasn't bad. I like how the portions are just right and they tell you all the macros. Definitely great if you don't have time to cook but want a well balanced meal. For someone who meal preps frequently, I'm not sure that I'll be a regular customer as I can cook my meals for way less. But for someone who can't or doesn't want to cook or just doesn't have time or know where to start, this is a great option."}
{"text":"Traveling for work and loved that I can stop in and buy foods for my trip got 2 breakfast, 2 dinners, a lunch and some snacks and spent 40 bucks. the portions are good and actually very tasty."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try My Fit Foods for sometime now and am excited to share this review with you. We all lead super busy lives and with that comes the convenience of Fast Food. With working 10 hour days and then spending an hour at the gym it can be hard to prepare healthy dinners. This has always been my biggest struggle. My boyfriend has always been super supportive and often helps out with the cooking but even his schedule can make it hard at times. My fit foods solves this problem! The meals are healthy and properly portioned. They are not frozen and are labeled with expiration dates. The only down fall is this sometimes means making multiple trips to the my fit foods store. This is a small inconvenience that is worth the pain in order to receive fresh meals. When I first did my research and read reviews I became worried about the sodium content of the meals. The sales lady in the store however put my mind at ease by showing me how the meals are coded. They take all diet and health restrictions into account and have a nutritionist on site to help with these concerns. My fit foods is reasonable (roughly around $7 dollars a meal), I received a discount for being a fitness Instructor, they are healthy, and they taste really good! I highly recommend them."}
{"text":"Love their fresh meal options...one of the best solutions for healthy quick food I have been able to find. 5 stars for days..."}
{"text":"I went there once for a week's worth of food.  I was dropped by my previous meal delivery service because I was too far away. I walked in with high hopes.  Unfortunately,  the meals did not meet my expectations.  Food was bland and cut veggies looked like someone took a hack saw to them instead of a sharp knife.  The most frustrating party is the price. I paid an arm and a leg for gross food that honestly sat in my fridge and grew mold."}
{"text":"So its the third week of January and I like many of you have a new years resolution of getting into better shape. We can all go to the gym drink all the water we need and eat healthy when we plan, but what if that plan goes right out of the window due to your hectic daily life? I know what I do I tend to try and eat something fast that is \"healthy\" Well much to my surprise most fast \"healthy \" options are as about as healthy as a snickers bar.   But My Fit Foods is different. It is a great concept with pre-made, pre-portioned and delicious meals ready for you on the spot. They also have a very knowledgeable and approachable staff. Their staff doesn't try and corner you into buying a bunch of stuff that will be the answer to all of your problems.   I stopped in for a quick bite in between meetings  and was greeted immediately. I was recommend to the turkey meatloaf with sweet potato walnut mash. I was very happy with it and the price!   This place has a lot to offer that I haven't even had a chance to look at yet like their 21 day challenge, nutrition coaching and I am sure of a lot more. If you are looking for a well priced truly healthy meal for your on the go life style then My Fit Foods is your answer."}
{"text":"I love this place! Ready made meal that are extremely healthy and tasty! Have tried several menu items and loved them all. Their protein powder is the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"This place looks like it's permanently closed, possibly along with all of the other Arizona locations. The website now shows no stores in AZ. Five stars since I liked it while it was open."}
{"text":"I love this place. Everything is fresh and weight conscious. For a healthy meal option they are full of flavor unlike some other weight conscious options. They offer breakfast,  lunch, dinner, and snacks in multiple sizes. My only complaint would be the prices are a little higher than I'd like to pay but well worth the price."}
{"text":"Best store for people who are busy and want to eat healthy. Certainly cheaper than going out everyday for lunch! I've already recommended it to my friends and family."}
{"text":"I am so glad I found this place! Ready made meals that are healthy, fresh, and don't taste bad! Where has this concept been all my life? I have probably cut my average daily caloric intake in half (at least) by getting my food here and I don't feel hungry. When I first looked at their website, I saw that the food came in different portions and assumed that the \"small\" was going to be like three bites and that's why it was so low calorie. Wrong! I honestly can eat three of these a day with maybe a snack and not feel hungry.  Between working full time and my other regular activities (plus being single and only having myself to feed) cooking just doesn't really fit into my schedule. I tend to eat out way too often, and I was feeling really unhealthy and gaining weight. I have tried some pre-packaged meal plans before and they were awful, they didn't even taste like food.   It isn't cheap, but if your previous lifestyle was like mine, neither was that. If you compare the prices to a family buying in bulk or a student living off ramen and spaghetti, then yes, it's ridiculously expensive. If you compare it to going out to dinner several times a week and grabbing lunch out someplace regularly, it's the same price or cheaper.   I'm still in the process of trying things and figuring out what I like and what I don't, but so far I have found a fair amount of things that taste good. I add hot sauce to a lot of things or a little salt and pepper, but really, they do a pretty good job."}
{"text":"Love this place. Perfectly portioned meals in small, medium and large. Not to mention 21 day challenge is awesome. U only have to pay for the food not the nutritionist advice. They make everything fresh and super easy for u to go in and pick up. Great drinks too. Healthy versions of soda that tastes like soda but without the bad additives and sugar. I will keep coming back!!!!"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place.  The entire place is gluten free... and the area it is located in does not have alot of good GF options.  Unfortunately the food isn't very good.  Not that it is bad... just not remarkable."}
{"text":"Thank you, Fabiola for always helping me pick my meals each time when i come in. Always have a smile on your face. Food is always amazing and I made my goal in 4 weeks of 10 pounds."}
{"text":"Not only have the employees been incredibly helpful and friendly to me, but I've found some entrees that I look forward to having, day in and day out.  They have microwaves on-site, if you want to cook and eat there.  I'm partial to the tacos, but because they are microwaved meals, the corn tortilla usually cracks before you can eat it.  For breakfast, my top 3 are: 1. Good Morning Sunshine: Spicy ground turkey, served over eggs and rice, topped with pico de gallo & cheese 2. Farmhouse Steak & Eggs: Yukon gold mashed potatoes and scrambled eggs, paired with marinated flank steak 3. Breakfast Tacos: Lean ground turkey with eggs & cheddar cheese, served over corn tortillas  For Lunch, my top 3 are: 1. Chicken and Sausage Gumbo: Creole Style Chicken Breast & Andouille Sausage Gumbo 2. Shredded Beef Tacos: Spicy shredded beef topped with pepper jack cheese, served in corn tortillas 3. Omega Me Crazy Salmon: Ginger glazed Scottish salmon with sugar snap peas & carrots  For Dinner, I've only tried the Ninja Tenderloin and the Butternut Pork.  I love the tenderloin, and the heated fresh spinach is pretty good.  I enjoy the pork, but the butternut is a little too al dente for me.  But all this is clean eating at its finest.  Check out the stats on some of these meals.  The protein count ranges right around 40g a serving for the regular sizes."}
{"text":"A breath of fresh air really...  I visited MFF for the first time today and the friendly and no pressure staff made it easy. I am just trying it out and bought enough items to last me three days. I actually could not wait to get home to try it out and have my first snack which consisted of cubed chicken, grapes, walnuts as well as orange and grapefruit segments and it was delicious.   It's hard to fault the quality as everything was super fresh and just perfectly portioned. For dinner I had their chicken with sauteed vegetables and thought it was also quite tasty...As for the price...well it's not exactly cheap but neither is going out to eat --I like the fact the items are prepared fresh and all you have to do is heat it up...I love the time saving factor, the  no messiness of it all and the fact I can plan my meals with ease knowing that will be eating something healthy while accomplishing my fitness goals!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place two stars because the concept is a great idea. Great for people who don't have time to cook. However, I have lost respect for this company when I was blatantly lied to by a few people at two different locations. As someone with a degree from ASU in Nutrition/Dietetics I of course asked what the credentials are of the \"nutritionists\" who work here. The girl told me she has a degree in nutrition from ASU. I was told the same thing at the location in Scottsdale. I suspected it was a lie so I called to speak to someone in management and they finally admitted that no one  who works there has a background in nutrition.   I would advise anyone considering buying meals from here to be aware of the high sodium content of their meals but more importantly realize how unprofessional and unethical it is to lie about credentials. When someone tells you that they are a \"nutritionist\" always ask what their background is as this is very different from someone who s a \"dietitian\". Don't let them dupe you. Like I said the concept is good but they could use a little work in business ethics."}
{"text":"Being a mother of a newborn baby and three-year-old this concept is absolutely perfect!!! I am working on getting my body back and this is going to help me get there. I was greeted as soon as I walked in and the coach explained the entire concept to me. The entire staff was wonderful. This is a very clean and professional place. The food is delicious and I cannot wait to try the 21 day challenge"}
{"text":"This place is great for the person who wants to eat better but really doesn't have the time or know how to put together good and healthy meals!  The food is healthy, well proportioned, convenient and pretty yummy too.  You can eat there, grab & go or pick up meals for several days and the prices are reasonable.  The staff is super friendly and knowledgeable and will show you how it works with no pressure.   I just started the 21 day challenge.  Liz is my coach.  She spent a good hour asking me about my life style, goals and challenges and then she explained how it all works in terms that made sense and were motivating. Basically, its like this...Liz picks out everything that I'm going to eat during the challenge and even gave me a schedule for what time to eat.  All I have to do is pick up my meals 2X a week.  On top of that, Liz  will call me or email me daily to make sure I'm doing alright and to hold me accountable.  Also, if I'm in a situation where I can't eat My Fit Foods...like a client dinner or I'm traveling for work, Liz will help me with choices.  Seriously, she said that I can just tell her where I'm going and she'll figure it out.  Literally, I don't have to shop, cook or clean.  I don't have have to worry about making the right choice because all the right choices are being made for me.  I mean, I'm pretty sure that every excuse for not getting in to better habits has been obliterated.  Now, we'll just see if it works."}
{"text":"I LOVE My Fit Foods!! I feel very lucky because the one at Tatum and Shea is right across the street from my work so I don't have to rely on fast food on those busy work days when I need something quick.   The employees there are friendly, helpful, and even supportive when we chatted about my goals. They always have a smile on their face and a friendly hello when I walk in.   I haven't tried everything (yet) but the few things I have tried have been fantastic. I love having fresh food that I just heat in my microwave - fast and easy! My favorites are the Lemon Turkey, Pollo Adobe Tacos, Chicken Corn Chowder, Shredded Beef Tacos, and the Good Morning Sunshine!   A great company, great service, and great food!"}
{"text":"I love this concept, and really want to be into this place, but I dislike how the food is seasoned.    I purchased an egg white omelet with spinach and sundried tomato's and sweet potato hash.  The sweet potatoes were very heavy on spices in a way that completely overwhelmed the omelet.  I took two bites but could not eat the rest.    I purchased a chicken salad snack, but the chicken salad was a bit on the sweet side for me.  I was glad that I only purchased one of the chicken salad options they had available.  I purchased a snack with seasoned chicken, walnuts, apples, oranges, grapefruit and grapes, but the herbs on the chicken were a bit overdone.  It was ok as long as I ate a bite of fruit with each bite of chicken, but I would not buy this again.  The food was fresh and healthy.  Apparently the herbs and spices are used heavily so that you don't notice the lack of salt, but I found the amount of seasoning off-putting.  Nothing that I purchased had more than 270 calories.  The food was easy to prepare.  Instructions for heating were very accurate.  The smaller portion sizes were perfect for me.  The staff was very helpful.  They stay nearby and anticipate questions you may have as you browse the cases.  The cases were well organized into breakfast, lunch, dinner and snack sections.  Everything was color coded according to which meal they were, and large versus regular sizes.  Everything was also labeled with calories and relative to food sensitivities.  The food is not inexpensive, but is cheaper than eating out by a few dollars.  As a single person, it is also cheaper than purchasing raw ingredients that would likely go to waste.  I still have a Ninja Tenderloin that needs to be eaten by tomorrow, but I'm not sure I can face it.  It looks good, but I'm nervous about whether I will dislike the taste."}
{"text":"My Fit Foods was a very unique healthy fast food type of a place.  It is not prototypical fast food in the sense the food is prepared right in front of you real fast.  The food is already made, but there are several selections for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks.  All of the items are roughly 300 calories or less.  The serving portion is smaller, but it is just right for any normal human being.  I just got finished from playing tennis, and I was hankering something spicy for some reason.  I went with the Indian choice option, and it tasted very much like Indian food, and the best part is that it was very healthy.  You can either heat up the food there in the microwaves or take it home to eat."}
{"text":"I wonder how My Fit Foods is going to address the compensation for those customers who have hundreds of not thousands of dollars on their house account? I hope that refunds are forthcoming."}
{"text":"I'm so glad there's a place like this that exists! I went there for the first time today and it was so good. The place is clean and the customer service was great. I wish I got the young ladies name that helped me. She took the time to tell me how everything worked as well as a bit of background to how the meals are prepared which I appreciate.  You know your getting nothing but the best when the food is fresh. You can either heat the food there or if you work or live nearby you can just take it home.  I'll definitely be back again since I work down the street.  Thank you for the great customer service :)"}
