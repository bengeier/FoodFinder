{"text":"This used to be our go-to Vietnamese place, however we will not step foot in this restaurant again.  My last visit, the server brought out our complimentary tea, took our order.  I poured out the tea, and it looked \"off\" - an orange colour.  I tasted it and it was spicy hot.  I asked the server about it, and he said, no no, it's fine.  I said, no look at it.  Turns out someone from the previous table had poured hot sauce into the tea pot, and they just refilled it and plunked it on our table.  I think this is a major infraction of cleanliness.  What if someone put something worse than hot sauce??  So needless to say, we won't go back with the poor sanitation."}
{"text":"A little restaurant. Noodles comes in 2 different sizes and price is really reasonable. I would go back!"}
{"text":"Desperate for some take-out one night, my friend suggested we try this tiny Vietnamese restaurant near her place. Neither of us had ever set foot in the restaurant, but we decided it would be easy, fast and cheap. It indeed was all of those things, in addition to being delicious!   Bow River is a tiny restaurant that offers both dine-in and take-out (no delivery) and is conveniently located on the corner of Elbow and Heritage SW. Sometimes, I find that a restaurant's food will be delicious in a dine-in setting, but the food takes a distinct nose-dive once you get it to go. I'm not sure if it's the Styrofoam that gets sweaty and leaves the food soggy, or if they just don't put the same care into a take-out order that they do with a dine-in, but it happens. But not so with Bow River. I've eaten there dine-in style, and gotten take-out more times than I can count, and the food's quality and flavor is consistently good.   My favorite thing there is the grilled pork chop with spring rolls on vermicelli. Really good flat-grilled pork strips, crispy spring rolls and shredded lettuce and carrots make this my go-to order at Bow River. The spring rolls, salad rolls and salt and pepper fried squid are also to die for. Their shrimp dishes do not disappoint either. The only thing I haven't tried here is the pho, but my boyfriend has gotten it and he cleaned the whole bowl, so I think it's pretty decent as well. They are also super accommodating with regards to my peanut allergy. If you specify \"no nuts\" they really do a good job leaving them off the order. My go-to pork/spring roll dish runs me no more than $9 or so. The price is right, and the food is tasty. Give them a try next time you want some casual weeknight take-out or a quick and inexpensive weekend bite!"}
{"text":"Nice and delicious restaurant around the corner !!! A must try for sure!!! Best I have so far!"}
{"text":"Friend who lived by here took me here for lunch, what an amazing little place. Love the  salads rolls. The service is very good! Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"I ordered a vermicelli with shrimp and spring rolls.  The service was very slow and inattentive once we did get served.  The shrimp were left on the grill way too long, they were almost burnt (shrimp cook fast only take 3 min to fully cook). This dish was boring and poorly prepared, lacked in flavour.  I will not return.  There are far better places in the vicinity."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years! Since way before it was renamed to bow river. They have some of the best Vietnamese I've had, and it's well priced. Nothing is over the top, and tons of options for pho, vermicelli or rice dishes. They have some of the best spring rolls I've ever had, and there salad rolls are to die for. I would recommend this place in a heart beat, it's fast affordable and delish!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went for Vietnamese food at Bow River restaurant 5 years ago and have been back there regularly ever since. The owner and his staff are really friendly and the service is good. Best Vietnamese restaurant in Calgary in my opinion. The food is made fresh everyday and you can taste the freshness. The price is very reasonable and the portion is great! I would recommend Bow River Vietnamese Restaurant if you're looking for some good pho or vermicelli."}
{"text":"Team Fam came here for dinner and I had the following:  Salad Rolls ($6, 4 rolls of shrimp, rice noodles, and lettuce) Large Pho Tai ($8.75, Vietnamese rice noodles with rare cooked beef)  Starting with the Salad Rolls, these came with a hearty amount of rice paper. I give kudos to the rice paper being chewy but not too wet or dry. I wish the Spring Rolls weren't made with cheap Chinese spring roll paper because that's the only reason I got Salad Rolls. Great substitute and price though, and I recommend them to be shared between 1 or 2 people. There was a good amount of shrimp inside but no Vietnamese ham; that's not a problem at this price.  The Pho Tai was actually supposed to be a Pho Tai Gan but there was a misspelling on their menu and by the time I realized it I was already done all my noodles and didn't want to send it back so oh well. The noodles here were a little hard. This affected their broth absorption which was a shame because the broth was fantastic. It was dark but not oily. That's the kind of beefy broth I like and if the noodles were a tad softer they would have had tons of broth infused into them. There was a good amount of beef but I wish there was tendon as I ordered. Compared to Bagolac Saigon, the pho is better there but you'll pay the difference in price. This was better than Minh Chau though."}
{"text":"I'm giving this one star because I barely even made it into the restaurant before deciding to get up and leave.  I had eaten here once before so thought I would give it another go as I couldn't remember if it was worth visiting again.  Before even getting through the door a young lady at the back of the restaurant asked \"booth or table\" when we told her we would like a booth she threw the menus on the table and walked into the back.  Never came to the front to greet us, never said hello, nothing.  Her body language said it all.  Walking up to the table I noticed the entire staff sitting at another booth not doing anything. Really!? If you're going to sit around at least do it where your customers cannot see you.  Must have been why the lady who gave us a table was so miserable, we were interrupting her being able to sit around and do nothing.  I was so turned off by the attitude that I decided to get up and we left before she even came back.   I will not be returning here. What a terrible way to welcome your customers.  I would never recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Just good all around good. Probably some of the best prices in the city.  Do yourself a favour and get some deep friend wontons as openers.  I enjoy the family run atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely wonderful! I don't understand the negative reviews and I think that they must now be focusing a bit  more on the customer service in the past year because we had a great experience. Plus, when I took my pho home and had it the next day it was even more delicious, so I definitely recommend getting more than you can eat and taking it with you.  I don't pretend to be a Pho expert, so I won't comment too much on authenticity but rather on deliciousness and boy was it delicious! I ordered the chicken satay and my husband got the rice noodle special. We also ordered the won tons as an appetizer. Everything we ate was tasty and I wanted to take bottles of the accompanying sauces with me.   Our wait staff was incredible. They were attentive and friendly and our food came out quickly. We were actually just given complimentary tea the moment we sat down and our waters came not shortly after that. (Just a side note - more places should offer complimentary tea, I mean, really, it's not that expensive and it really warms you up to a place.) I had a coupon book coupon, which was the initial reason we found the place, and they were flexible with it. It was pretty empty when we arrived but it quickly filled up and yet our service level didn't decline.  We will definitely come back or even drive all the way down to the South to order take out. We really loved it that much."}
{"text":"Okay... Great service and good tea. Lots of the people I went with seemed to enjoy it, but I found the vegetarian dish I got to be bland and tasteless in comparison to other Vietnamese places in the city. Maybe another dish would change my mind, or meat is more their thing!"}
