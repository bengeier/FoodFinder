{"text":"there's not a better place in this part of town (north phoenix) for a special occasion.  The best calamari in town, their salmon is seasoned and prepared to perfection, and unbelievably scrumptious cheesecake.  very high end-clientele and expense, but worth the cost and you'll leave feeling like you've been treated royally *(with leftovers!!)"}
{"text":"Very disappointed!!! The service was unacceptable and the food was not good! We had to ask for a waiter to come over and take our drink order because no one came to our table. Our appetizer was incorrect and not good. Our steaks were delicious but the sides...the mashed potatoes were instant. Totally not worth the cost, there are too many delicious restaurants in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"The Food is GREAT! Unfortunately in the span of a Month we have had 2 company dinners there and both times we have had food poisoning. 

The customer service is phenomenal, the food is just great, good portions, well seasoned. The first dinner 1 person had food poisoning and we thought it a fluke, we should try this place again because everything was so good. Second dinner, 2 people with food poisoning. Unfortunately we will not be visiting again. Order with precaution."}
{"text":"I don't think there's a better seafood or steak place in the city. 

If you're undecided on what to try, consider... 
Any size fillet, oscar style 
Chilean sea bass 
Salt and pepper tuna 
Diver scallops 

Pair anything with the mac and cheese or mushrooms.  Sides are meant to be shared 

Start with tuna tartar or fondue, and end with the peanut butter pie 

OP's wine list is very nice, but I think everyone should try a pinefin on the rocks at some point."}
{"text":"The food here was really good.   They were out of oysters but we ordered the jumbo shrimp cocktail which was really good.   French onion soup and lobster bisque both awesome. 

I had a mojoto for a cocktail,  it was subpar, tasted like it was a premix and not freshly made.

Dinner was the Sunday special (for 2 in our party) crab stuffed lobster, sea bass for 1 and I had the scallops.   All were very very good and highly recommended.   Sides were Brussel sprouts and lobster mashed potatoes.  

I gave this restaurant 4 stars instead of 5 because the service was poor. The food was really really good but our waiter did not do a good job. He was not attentive to our table. He was told that somebody in our party was celebrating a birthday and did not even offer a dessert. He forgot to put in the order for our side dishes which did not come out with dinner. The restaurant did comp the side dishes which was a nice gesture but at a rest restaurant like this the service should be better.

The waiter seemed like he was high or just a space cadet.

I would return to this restaurant because the food was so good and I'm sure other wait staff would be better than the one we got."}
{"text":"We went there on a Monday night for a birthday dinner. The ambiance is lovely. The food was great. The service.....meh. Sydney, the hostess, was perky and helpful. It was our server assistant and our server that lacked polish, professionalism and knowledge. It was very surprising considering the reputation of Ocean Prime. The server assistant just kept walking back and forth not pouring our sparkling water. We had to do it ourselves. Our appetizers came at different times because the server didn't understand we wanted two orders of the oysters. Our champagne took a long time. And at one point a man in a suit came by and asked if everything was good? We answered and he walked away. Who was he? A manager? The owner? Some drunk customer?  We don't know. The server responded to our questions with \"I don't know\", \"Let me check\",  \"I suppose\". And her hair was very messy. It was a pony tail with the sides down. All of it should be pulled back. We counted the tables and there were seven including ours. The service could have definitely been better with the amount of tables in the dinning room.

I would go back because maybe it was an off night. Like I said, the food was great. The Alaskan Halibut was delicious!"}
{"text":"I ate dinner at ocean prime tonight and really enjoyed myself.  The service was nice; was greeted with a smile upon entry and seated fairly quickly.  My waitress was very friendly too!  I had the 10 ounce filet Mingnon, the jalapeño au gratin, asparagus and garlic mashed potatoes.  Literally everything was delicious! My steak was tender and juicy and full of flavor! The jalapeño au gratin was the best au gratin I've ever had. The restaurant itself is very nice and definitely on the pricier side.  It would be a nice place for a date.  Thumbs up!!! :)"}
{"text":"We had an enjoyable evening at Ocean Prime.  The food was good and the wait staff seemed attentive.  Is it on par with some of the better restaurants I've visited, no, not quite but still very good.  My Arctic char was good but slightly under seasoned.  They had salt on the table but I hate the taste of iodized salt so I used it very sparingly.  My companions both loved their dishes (filet and seared ahi tuna). The beet salad on their Sonoma menu was terrific and it reminded me of Sonoma where I used to live.  The big disappointment was the Siduri wine that was paired with the \"Sonoma\" menu.  I've tasted wine at the Siduri winery many times (15 min from where I lived) so I knew it would be a solid choice.   Unfortunately, that is where they stumbled.  Instead of a Sonoma Pinot, they served the Willamette Valley Pinot and we didn't catch it until we started talking about the wine and how it didn't taste like it came from Sonoma.  It was still a good wine but it felt like a bait and switch which left a blemish on an otherwise great meal.  (Just so you know the Willamette valley is in Oregon and Sonoma is in California....sure it was still made by Siduri but that isn't the point.). I hope it was an honest mistake by our server and not really deception on their part."}
{"text":"This past Friday, February 3, 2017, my wife and I had dinner at Ocean Prime at 7:00.  This was a special dinner for our anniversary that had been planned a couple weeks in advance and that we were looking forward to.  We started with a couple of drinks and ordered soup for both of us.  The Lobster Bisque was very good, however, the French Onion Soup was just average and burnt on the bottom of the bowl.  Not long after placing our order for the main course, we noticed that the table immediately next to us was talking and laughing extremely loud.  It became rather apparent from their behavior and conversation that several of the people at the table were very drunk.  Their rude and obnoxious behavior was very inappropriate for what was supposed to be a high class restaurant.  One of the female patrons at this table was sitting on a male guests lap and moving in a manner that would suggest she was interested in more than just a nice dinner.  After several minutes of this rude behavior, both her and her male partner, left the table to walk to what we assume was the restrooms.  This female was so drunk that she required assistance to walk between the tables.  Once she returned to the table, she stood at the end of her party's table and did her best to perform her own version of a table dance.  Much of the loud and obnoxious conversation from this table consisted of \"F Bombs\" regarding the activities of the day (it appeared that they were at the golf tournament).  It did cross our mind to ask our waiter if we could be moved to another table, but from our observation it appeared that the restaurant was rather full.  Not wanting to create what we felt would have been an ever larger distraction for the surrounding guests, we started our main course and did our best to ignore the rude behavior of this table.  We ordered the Teriyaki Salmon, which was ok, but a bit dry and the Lamb Chops which were just average.  For our sides to our meal, we ordered a twice baked potato which was huge and delicious and the creamed spinach which was just average.  When asked if we wanted  to order a couple more drinks we had decide at that point that we were no longer enjoying our anniversary dinner  because of this rude group next to us and finished our dinner as quickly as we could.  We paid our bill and left having been very disappointed with our dinner experience.  In discussing the evening later that evening we felt that at the very least, the obnoxious group next to us should have been asked to behave more in line with what one would expect from a group of 30 something adults.  This dinner was to have been  a special evening for the both of us and not at all what we would have expected for a $200.00 dinner.  It is our opinion that this was more of an Ocean Embarrassment than an Ocean Prime experience.  Although it's not the restaurants fault that the people at this table behaved in a manner that was completely inappropriate, it certainly was there fault that they did nothing about it, allowed it to continue and ruined our special evening and likely that of the other guests at the surrounding tables."}
{"text":"The food was awesome. The service was impeccable. The atmosphere was romantic. It is a couples place. It is on the high end but it is worth it. Plenty of food for the money. Our waiter and the manager was very attentive. We will return soon."}
{"text":"We truly enjoyed everything about our anniversary dinner at Ocean Prime last night. Before we went into dinner, we sat outside for happy hour. It's very comfortable out there and the service was great. I loved the bubbly berry cocktail! Service at dinner was impeccable. The food was cooked exactly to perfection. We would not change anything!   It was our anniversary dinner, so they had red rose petals scattered around our table. They gave us a complimentary 10 layer carrot cake that had Happy Anniversary written in chocolate on it. They really made it a wonderful celebration for us. We recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are very familar with Cameron Mitchell restaurants as we are from Columbus, Ohio, Cameron's home base.  We were excited to find Ocean Prime a very short drive from where we were staying at the Marriott Canyon Villas timeshare in February.  We brought with us our son and daughter-in-law for a belated Valentine Day celebration on February 15.  The restaurant is fabuously decorated and lit.  The ambiance is perfect for a business dinner or a romantic dinner.  Each of us had something different:  The crab stuffed tilapia, the veal, scallops and the chef made a salmon \"oscar-style\" for me, something not on the menu.  We also sampled the incredible French Onion soup, the Caesar Salad and our son and his wife enjoyed the oyster appetizer.  Every dish was exceptional!

We shared the TEN layer carrot cake and a chocolate dessert.  Wow, they were amazing!

The service was excellent, attentive and well paced.

It is one of the best meals we've ever had and it will be on our list every time we're back at Canyon Villas."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. I choose Oceanprime when I want to make sure I have the best steak and seafood. The Kung Pao calamari is outrageously good.  The colossal shrimp cocktail is the best I've ever had. The shrimp are simply huge. Love this place. I can usually get in for dinner during the week without a lot of advance reservations."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times before and thought it was decent. A friend is moving out of state and we were gathering for a good bye party for her. I worked a very long day but made a special effort to get to the party at OP. I did have my 2 yr old tot on my hip as I didn't get to see him since he woke up this morning and his bedtime wasn't far off, so I didn't want leave him with a sitter and therefore not see him at all. I wasn't planning on staying long. When I asked the hostess about the party that I knew was already seated, she informed me I couldn't go in since I had my son. She said they have a strict no one under 21 policy at all hours. I read a review from January that mentioned  kids, and they don't say that on their website, but ok. I explained the situation, and asked her if I might just visit the table to drop off the card and let my friend know that I couldn't stay. She said no. No offer to take the card in for me, no offer to let my friends know that I was outside and not allowed in, just simply no. And so, that will be my last visit there.

Update: the GM reached out to my friend who booked the party, and then mailed me a personal letter of apology and a gift card. Went there after the first of the year, received great service, the food was wonderful. Nice change from the prior visit."}
{"text":"Could not have asked for better service or a more enjoyable food experience! My steak was excellent and my wife's Chilean Sea Bass was superb! They let you enjoy the meal and do not rush you to finish. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Husband and I made a reservation for dinner during our Honeymoon and we were treated with amazing service and food.
Our last name is Smith and our table had 'Brad Pitt' and 'Angelina Jolie' Reserved signs...see what they did there (Mr. and Mrs. Smith)!?!  Tables are double teamed so we were never without fresh water or drinks (or left with empty plates on the table).
We had the Oysters (there are 6 to an order so we got 2) to start then the Filet Mignon (with blue cheese) and the Sea Scallops entrees. Everything (service and food) was AMAZING and we highly recommend dining here."}
{"text":"I'm not even sure I know how to describe our first experience at Ocean Prime. Everything from the service to the cosmopolitan was perfect. Our server, Sean, was so friendly and fun. The ambiance was relaxing and enjoyable, a nice place to be away from the kiddo. 

Describing the food is going to be difficult, because everything was so perfect and enjoyable. Sean said \"phenomenal\" a few times, and he's right. The food (every bite) was phenomenal! 

For our appetizer we ordered the Point Judith Calamari. Cooked perfectly and the flavor profile was sweet and spicy. I loved every bite! 

I ordered the blackened swordfish as my entree. It was cooked to perfection and the surrounding flavors were indescribable. My husband ordered the NY strip which was accessorized with roasted garlic and rosemary. It was so tender and cooked to absolute perfection.

We had jalepeno au gratin as our side and THOSE...THOSE were phenomenal. The jalepeno flavor was mild and wonderful. No heat, for those who can't handle it, so I highly recommend it to anyone! 

Our dessert was to die for. We ordered the 10 layer carrot cake, and wow. Just wow! Every layer, every crumb, every drizzle of pineapple syrup was exquisite. I think I dreamed about bathing in it. I WOULD bathe in it. 

I woke up still full and satisfied. We drove far (not too far) to get there and would over and over again. It was worth every dollar spent and mile driven!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment!  Beautiful packaging with no substance.  With prices like these, one expects excellent, knowledgeable service. Yet, our $300 bill was not commensurate with the lackluster and often neglectful service of the seemingly endless staff looking terribly busy.  Specifically, our criticism includes:
--An empty water glass for 25 minutes
--Clearing of plates while others are still eating
--Leaving a menu item off the order (not on the bill)
--Leaving us with the dessert menu and never coming back to take the order. In fact, we had paid the bill when the waiter returned to take the order. 
--self service needed on a second glass of wine and the bill. Meaning we had to get up and find someone to get both of these. 

As for the quality of our meal, it was good.  Not outstanding. Avoid the sushi apps if you actually enjoy sushi and not a mouthful of sickly sauce. Scallops were tasty and well cooked. Lamb great. Grouper yes. Seems like the kitchen is doing their part and being undermined by the front house. 

Don't recommend. Will not return given the choices in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This is the first weekend that Ocean Prime was open for business in the new City North. The restaurant and bar were packed, but they sure had enough people working there to make sure you had a great experience.  

They start you off there with a very different, yet interesting relish tray with veggies,crackers, and a cream cheese dip along with a basket of freshly baked hot bread.
We spent some time looking at the menu because there is definitely a variety of foods to choose from.  We started off with the calamari for an appetizer even though the salads looked great. The flavor was great due to the spicy/orange sauce that they cook it in.  

As for the entree, I ended up getting the sea bass. It stated on the menu that it came with glazed carrots so I opted not to get one of the interesting potato or veggie sides. This is a heads up for all of you...the carrots were only a garnish on the plate, so make sure you order a side item along with those 5 specialty items because the veggies that it says it comes with are more of a garnish.  The sea bass had a very good flavor, however, I like my fish to come steaming hot and I would say that it was more luke warm and a little bit chewy for me. My husband got the salt and pepper tuna and really enjoyed his entree. 

I don't know how all of you feel about room temperature red wine, but my husband and I enjoy our red wine chilled. The bottles there and the glasses of red are not chilled. However, our very friendly waitress told us that under our name in the computer they took a note saying that we like our red wine chilled so the next time that we make reservations they will ask us beforehand if we want the wine chilled so it is ready for us when we come in for dinner which was a nice little perk.

Overall, I give Ocean Prime 4 stars because the food was tasty, the selection of foods on the menu was great, and the ambiance was excellent. A lot of these restaurants are so loud that you have to yell to the person next to you. You could definitely hear in there.  I will definitely go back and try something different on the menu."}
{"text":"I went here with my wife for our anniversary and it was a fantastic experience from start to finish. When making the reservation the girl asked me if it was a special occasion and I told her it was our anniversary. Everyone told us happy anniversary while we were there, they gave us a sweet hand written card, and also gave us a small discount off our check. The food was amazing. The prices are upscale but not too high. Everything was good. The bread was good, the calamari appetizer was great, my swordfish was unreal. It's probably the best swordfish I've ever had. My wife loves Creme Brulee and after her first bite she said, \"now this is how it's supposed to taste\". They wrote Happy Anniversary in chocolate on the plate which was a nice touch. The service was impeccable. We stayed and slowly ate our meal for 2 hours and never once felt rushed. Just a great overall experience."}
{"text":"Service - 3 stars. A bit of a long wait to order, but otherwise pretty good. Waiter was not overly attentive. 

Food - 4 stars. Well cooked tuna, beef steaks and lobster tails. 

Atmosphere - 4 stars. Great decor, crowd, music. 

Value for $ - 2 1/2 stars. Portions are small and about 25% higher than what they should be."}
{"text":"We live on High Street so frequently we stroll down to OP. First, Trent is the absolute best bar tender! He always tells us the new wines and what we may want to try. The food, superb every time.  We love going here and often do bring our business partners. Great venue to impress!"}
{"text":"Oh so close to 5 stars...but not quite there.  

My wife and I had reservations on a Friday night as we expected OP to be very busy.  Well, the restaurant was never half full.  One of the reasons for the one star reduction was that they had several open booths but, even with reservations, seated us at a table near the kitchen in the middle of everything.  We were there 2 hours and two booths were never used.  Guess maybe they actually were waiting for Sophia Loren or Sammy Davis Jr. to show up...and I thought those tags on the table were only a joke...silly me!

Based on taste alone, easily 5 stars.  The She Crab Bisque was flavored perfectly and had a nice small crab fritter in the middle.  The corn was sweet, crunchy, and fresh.  The only problem was it was served barely warm..almost cool.  For main courses my wife had blackened swordfish and I had Lobster Tail with Truffle Butter.  The lobster was amazing.  Perfectly cooked, tender, sweet and covered with orgasmic truffle butter.  They claim everything on the menu is a 9oz portion, but the lobster tail did seem a bit small.  Could just be I wanted more it was so good or it just looked so lonely presented alone on such a big plate.  My wife adores swordfish but doesn't get it often with all the controversy these days.  She is happy she used the opportunity here to have it.  Perfectly blackened and very moist.  The spices were just right...so many times blackened items can be over spiced.  I'm not a big fish-fish eater but would order this anytime.  We split a side of Truffled Mac and Cheese.  OMG...I would love to make an entire meal out of this guilty pleasure sometime.  Even if it means not being able to walk for days.  The server told me a lot of the employees get there early so they can eat a bowl of it before work.  For dessert (like we should have even attempted at this point) we shared the monstrously huge Baked Alaska.  This too was fantastic.  It is made with Vanilla, Chocolate, and Black Raspberry ice cream they make there, sitting in chocolate and raspberry sauces, and covered with beautifully torched meringue.  It could easily have fed three or four.  The coffee is individually pressed at the table.  Very nice presentation but the coffee itself was quite bitter.

In terms of service our waitress was very friendly but a bit slow to check back.  I believe she was fairly new as she had to think a bit to describe the special and other dishes.  But, she had a great smile and was very nice so not a problem.

Bottom line, this is a great seafood restaurant that I can't wait to go back to!"}
{"text":"It was the first time I set foot in City North and it was up to me to choose where we were going to dine with our party of 4. I picked Ocean Prime. The venue is great, beautiful contemporary restaurant. It was quasi empty when we got there at 5pm for Happy Hour.
Sara was our server and she did not want to be there. No eye contact and she was in a hurry. No smile or barely. We all ordered two items from the happy hour menu which were $5 and $8 each. They brought us the parmesan fries which we did not order but we thought they came with it. We were charged for them.
Kobe sliders are dry and are definitely not Kobe beef. Truffled Chicken liver, not bad and generous serving. Cheese and meat platter: one had to look where to find the meat and the cheese. Chicken satay: good. I think the oysters were good too.Creme brulee and Baked Alaska: good. 
I would say: it's a nice venue, the server needs training, the cook also. The bill was high for a happy hour. Would I go back? ...I will try out some other ones on that street."}
{"text":"It was my parent's 27th anniversary so my mom asked if my hubby & I would like to join them for dinner, of course we would! Typically my parents would go to Outback or Olive Garden but I asked if we could please switch it up & my mom told me to pick a place. I had received a postcard from Ocean Prime for $25 off & thought why not? It must have been meant to be because my mom got one too & said she was thinking about trying it out also. I called & made reservations for Saturday the 26th at 7pm. 

The place was packed when we arrived, literally every table was filled. The design was very sleek & modern, with neon blue lighting. We were seated at a table near the bar & Rebecca was our server, she was awesome! 

Fresh bread & butter were immediately brought out, yummy. We started off with the colossal shrimp cocktail & half order of oysters. My hubby & I shared the shrimp cocktail, 3 HUGE pieces of shrimp with dry ice underneath, very cool & very tasty. My parents shared the oysters & loved them. My dad is a scotch man so he ordered a couple johnnie walker's with club soda. I am a vodka girl so I decided to try the berries & bubbles cocktail. OMG was this cocktail delicious, the pieces of fruit & dry ice sent it over the top, I loved it so much I had 2. My hubby went with the tequila cocktail & thought it was just ok, I knew he should have stuck with his usual captain & coke. 

On to the entrees. My dad ordered the 7oz filet mignon (med-rare), my mom ordered the salt n pepper tuna (WELL DONE! WTF, WHO DOES THAT? I TOLD HER NOT TO BUT SHE INSISTED, UGH.), my hubby ordered the sea scallops & I ordered the twin lobster tails. For sides we all shared the sauteed wild mushrooms & jumbo asparagus with hollandaise. We all sampled each others entrees & everything was amazing, except my mom's tuna since she ruined it by ordering it well freakin done, but my lobster tails were the crowd favorite. Both side dishes were delicious as well. We were all so full but decided to get dessert since we were celebrating. We chose the chocolate peanut butter pie. Damn was it good, somehow we all managed to make room & had to keep ourselves from licking the plate clean. 

I brought that $25 off postcard I mentioned earlier & so did my mom. I thought they wouldn't except both at one table, but since we were paying with 2 cards they let us use 1 on each card, awesome! So with the promotional $50 off our total came to about $230 (not including tip). A tad overpriced, (which is why I only gave 4 stars) so I don't see us coming often, but we all thoroughly enjoyed our dinner so for a special occasion it's worth the splurge!"}
{"text":"The food was yummy. A little bit high in price, but it is in Scottsdale. Atmosphere was nice and the staff was accommodating."}
{"text":"This place deserves 4.5 stars.  The restaurant  is great to look at.  I love the bar and how open it is.  Outside along the City North street, they have a lounge area with beautiful gas fireplaces and cozy couches.  We went for the happy hour (every night from 4-7).  I appreciate a place that does the weekend happy hour.  We each had a great cocktail.  My cosmo had dry ice, which made it fun as well as tasty.  We had four appetizers instead of dinner.  We had the crab cakes which were great (not greasy at all), the tuna tartare, which was quite good, the fondue (which was great because they gave you fresh vegetables to dip in the cheese) and the deviled eggs.  We even split a dessert, which I rarely do, but the key lime pie was delish...although a bit too big. I have to admit that I am rating this place for the bar food.  We didn't even eat off of the main menu."}
{"text":"Beware of their happy hour menu! All the food looks upscale, fresh, appetizing, and decently priced. Kobe sliders, king crab spinach dip, Parmesan truffle fries, and oysters, all for under $10. Sounds pretty good right? Wrong. The items Ive listed are the exact things that we ordered. 

Lets start with the sliders.... You get 2. Two, tiny (NOT KOBE) sliders. There's more bread then there is meat. They are literally the size of a newborns hand. They tasted bland and dry.

The spinach dip was sub par. They served it with 5 tiny pieces of stale bread. 

The Parmesan truffle fries were soggy and tasteless. As I took my first bite I thought to myself, McDonald's trumps these fries. 

The oysters were the best out of all of the items we ordered. BUT... They're $8 and you get only 4. You mine as well head to the casino cause you'll get more for your money. 

The only thing that saved this monstrosity of a meal was the booze. 

The service was OK... took a while for a drink refill and she wasn't very personable.

All in all... I would never return to Ocean Prime and wouldn't be surprised if it closed. Skip this place and go to Flemmings. Same prices but amazing quality food."}
{"text":"I truly enjoyed this great ambiance and the food was full of flavor. The service was over the top and that was what I expected when I we walked in the door. The staff was very friendly and attentive. If you are looking for a classy place to dine with that special someone or entertain clients this is the place. The only issue was when I tried to check in on Yelp it said I was to far away. LOL"}
{"text":"First, let me say this was our first time here. The ambiance was beautiful. We started off with lots of appetizers that were great, the calamari was excellent! Unfortunately, it went down hill from there. Two people had fish which was basically inedible due to seasoning. The \"house special\" swordfish was smothered in a sauce which I wouldn't serve to my worst enemy, not to mention the Cajun rub was brutal, and I love Cajun swordfish! Another person had the lobster, which probably should not have been served, it came out overly salted and saturated in butter, WOOF! The steak was average, but not nearly on the level of Eddie Vs, or Dominicks. Although the Manager came over and took the lobster and sword off our bill, he did not even ask why or what was wrong with them, which is what really prompted this review."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for happy hour on a Friday. The atmosphere is chill, the ambiance is classy, and the piano-playing topped off the great atmosphere. 

We sat at the bar. The bartender was great...very attentive. Their happy hour menu is fabulous - many happy hour menus have cheap wine that tastes like dirty socks...not this place...their wine was good.

We stuck with happy hour food and did not order dinner, so I cannot review their food, but if you're looking for an upscale yet highly affordable happy hour, this is a great spot."}
{"text":"My family and I were in town for a cousin's wedding, and we came here for my father's birthday.

The decor is lovely.  Modern and very spacious, with a nice outdoor eating area or two.  The backgroud music was a nice selection of popular music and I didn't find it too loud, I thought it was at just the right level to keep everyone's conversations private.

Our waiter, David, was top notch.  Really great.

My father and I had the deviled eggs as an appetizer and both of us loved them.  I tried my mother's crab cake and it was OK.  My sister said she enjoyed her fish tartare appetizer.

Everyone except me ordered a steak, and everyone really liked theirs.  We're from New York and have tried just about all of the steakhouses there, plus my mother is a butcher's daughter, so hard to please, so it says something about how good their steaks are.

I was disappointed in their crabmeat crusted tilapia.  Way too wet for my liking, but maybe some people like their fish on the very wet side.

We also ordered sides:  truffled parmesan fries (pretty good), truffled macaroni & cheese (again too wet for my liking, asparagus (perfect!) and mushrooms (I didn't try them, but everyone else liked them).

The reason I took off a star was that for this pricepoint I would want every dish to be a winner, which personally for me they weren't.  Overall, good dishes, but not across the board.

At the end of the day, however, I would definitely recommend the place."}
{"text":"We had a bachelor party dinner at ocean prime and we were extremely pleased with our visit. We arrived promptly for our reservation and our table was ready. Our waiter was prompt on taking our initial drink orders and following up with us through the evening. The food was excellent! My steak was cooked perfectly and the sides were amazing!

Pro tip: The have both wet and dry aged steaks here! Ask your server before ordering!"}
{"text":"Only had a short time & wanted a good drink on a nice patio after shopping desert ridge (and did NOT want any of the places there).

So, went staight to the patio bar - bar is sexy & posh & elegant.  Patio quite nice, even though only a few feet from street - not busy so it was fine).  Cool sofas to relax in & the ambiance of the glass fire pits were neat.

BEST martini with fresh fruit & champange - shaken at the table - luv that.

(FYI - this place is very pricey, just be warned! (not sure I'l lbe back for $$$$$ dinner).  But i would definatley stop in again for a tini (or 2)."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time for my birthday.  It was excellent.  We had reservations but decided to stay at the bar and eat dinner.  I believe our bartender was Natalie and she gave great advice on the menu and service.  We had Filet with shrimp scampi added and the Scallop and Risotto dinner.  For sides she recommended the brussel sprouts and Jalapeno Au Gratin.  For dessert we had the peanut butter pie, all were excellent!  We'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"it's restaurant week in phoenix, and some friends invited me to join them at ocean prime. since i LOVE fresh seafood, i was looking forward to checking this place out. the atmosphere was very upscale, lots of tables, all in all an enjoyable decor. outside dining is also available. my 3 friends all took advantage of the 40 dollar menu. among the choice were a house or caeser salad, crab crusted tilapia, petite filet mignon, and ginger salmon. tilapia is a farmed fish, salmon has become quite pedestrian and has never been a favorite and i do not order steak at a seafood place. the waitress did mention the special. and i turned out to be my favorite fish, alaskan halibut, with crabmeat and asparagus. but the fish was the price of the whole deal my friends were getting., 40 bux. but you only live once and i ordered the dish, after finishing patti's caeser salad. i also opted for the gigantic shrimp coctail. 3 shrimp but they were enourmous and perfectly cooked with a very nice spicy horseradish based sauce.  also enjoyed a cocktail with berries that was delicious if again a bit pricy at 14 bux. i almost skipped dessert,..the other three had to have creme brulee, which is almost like tiramasu, in that it is the stereotypical dessert. had my share of both by the time the millenium began. so i had a peanut butter mouse with dark chocolate ganache. it was too sweet for me, but i can see where others, especially reeses peanut butter cup freaks, would love it. check with tip came out to 130 dollars...a bit steep, cosidering my friends paid a whole lot less. but  this is one of the better seafood places in town...and if someone wants to take me out, i will gladly go back.. lol."}
{"text":"This place is great. Very similar to
Mastros but slightly less expensive. I love fine dining and this is a perfect spot for date night! Food is great and so are the drinks. Plus it's in walking distance of Rick Bronson's house of comedy! Worth making the trip for."}
{"text":"upon arrival they tried to force into the high top tables in the bar as opposed to the dining area that wasn't busy at all.  I was quick to say if I wanted to sit in a bar why would I come here.  I expect to be seated in the dining area.  Seriously?  
I felt the waiter was constantly trying to upswell us and the steak was warm not hot. Their 5oz lobster was more like 2.5. 
I highly recommend the public to find another steak house."}
{"text":"Food and service was absolutely amazing! Steak was cooked perfectly and melted in my mouth. I will be back soon as I can."}
{"text":"Staff was amazing. There was a wide selection on the menu and everything was high quality. The red snapper is what I have and it was delicious my husband had the Chilean sea bass and he loved it. The restaurant itself was beautifully decorated and very comfortable. We will return and we highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place... is EXCELLENT. I am generally not all that impressed with steak houses - I feel like I can make a mean steak at home and sides are all pretty similar (au-gratin potatoes, mashed potatoes, creamed spinach...) So... what made this place so cool to me? I usually order crab cakes as an appetizer and am nearly always disappointed (I have been to Maryland... nothing compares!) This place was different though! Sure it wasn't as good as a Baltimore, but it was better then everything else I have had outside of there!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here early one evening and had a wonderful experience. The service was exceptional as was the food. I really enjoyed the calamari appetizer. It was unlike any I'd had before. We enjoyed ourselves, however, my steak was no better than one half the price I could have gotten down the street at The Keg Steakhouse. Perhaps I should have ordered fish. My wife loved the sea bass. Be prepared to spend some coin."}
{"text":"Excellent! I got the 10oz. filet and it was cooked perfectly at medium rare. The rib eye was also very good. My dad got the crab bisque and he said that it was excellent. Someone else got the Chilean Sea Bass...which they said was VERY good. The jalapeno au gratin potatoes are fantastic. The corn was also a very good side too. The appetizers were also good. A few in our party got the oysters and they were very good. As for desserts, my wife got the creme brulee and she said it was the best she has had. We also ordered the peanut butter/chocolate pie which was excellent. The food is on par with Mastro's and Ruths Chris. Overall, the service was excellent."}
{"text":"I've been to Ocean Prime 3 or 4 times over the last year, each time for larger business dinners.  This time there were just three of us sitting and the bar.  We had good drinks, great laughs and a delicious buttery crab and spinach drink.  I highly recommend the cucumber gimlet if you're game.

We decided to stay and order from the bar.  While ordering I selected the bone-in filet and asked for the peppercorn sauce on the side.  I wasn't 100% sure if I'd like it So I wanted to be safe, not sorry.  It was a $48 entree.

When dinner was served my steak had the peppercorn sauce smothered all over it.  I sent it back.  

Not happy about the request, the bartender returned my steak to the kitchen for a redo.  I would have never thought they'd bring the sane exact steak back to me, sans sauce.

How do I know?  Size/shape/texture and my buddy ordered the same temperature as me, but mine was much more re-cooked.

Frustrated and hungry I ate the flavor-washed steak and kept my mouth shut. Last time I eat here.  The end."}
{"text":"My wife and I we're at Spphire Mrtini down the street and decided to go for dinner. We went to Oean Prime on a lark. We wound up sitting in the bar which was very comfortable and they serve the full menu. 

Te bar had great ambiance with some good guitar and even people dancing at some point in the evening. We started off by ordering some cocktails. My wife had the Berry and Bbbles and I had the Mojitowhich had some berry action as well. The cocktails we're superb. 

Our server Carrie was a doll and very attentive without being intrusive. We started off with the seafood tower. The quality of the oysters we're by far the best and the lobster was okay. In the future I would just order the oysters. 

We also shared an order of the sweet Chili calamari which was excellent and I strongly recommend it. 

For dinner I had the bone in fillet, and my wife had the Australian lobster tail. My steak was cooked to perfection and a light to eat. We also orderedhe jalapeno gratin potatoes and the truffle mac & cheese. The truffle mac and cheese was great. The Au gratin potatoes need more flavoring for my book. 

Desert was equally delightful and we sampled the key lime pie and the sorbets. 

All in all a great date night for any couple with a casual feeling. The design of the restaurant is fantastic and you can go wrong for dinner or just drinks. Plenty of flat panel TV's if you want to enjoy a game in the bar as well."}
{"text":"Ocean Prime is my favorite seafood restaurant in the Phoenix area, and I've tried many. Based on 4 experiences at Ocean Prime I can conclude that it's a higher quality and better value than Mastro's and similar restaurants.  All seafood at Ocean Prime comes with generous, perfectly chosen accompaniments. Their swordfish is amazing and I also love the scallops with risotto and peas.  It's our go-to for a nice seafood date night!"}
{"text":"Had a nice group dinner here with several couples attending the National Championship College Football game this last Monday. We ordered several appetizers and main courses as follows:
Spicy calamari
Huge Jumbo prawns served with cocktail sauce.
Tuna tartar
Goat cheese stuffed raviolis
For a main courses:
Lamb Chops
Lobster tails
Tenderloin of beef
Scallops and risotto.
Side orders of mushrooms, mashed potato and lobster, French fries in truffle butter, creamed spinach.
All very tasty and good service."}
{"text":"Visited Arizona for a few days and my coworker introduced me to this place. The enviorment was amazong and the food was even better. I will definitely return to this reaturant everytime I visit"}
{"text":"Risotto  salty but got it taken off with the scallops. Halibut was dry. Nice setting but the place is overpriced and the food we ordered was not great."}
{"text":"Ok when you first go in, they seem a bit snooty at the front desk and the girls have a tendency of only giving attention to the guy your with (sorry but thats the truth).  That usually irks me right off the bat because they have no idea it might be ME thats actually paying the bill and leaving them the tip.

We usually like to skip main dining room and head right over to the bar side -- much more fun.  We usually get a high top there and start with a round of Cucumber Gimlets - but made with vodka not gin.  OMG - these are the best drinks EVER.  We usually order a calamari - which has a spicy sweet brown sauce with it and is wonderful.  

We then usually split an entree and a couple of side items and our choice is the bone-in filet all the time.  The meat is prepared beautifully and the taste is awesome.  Their truffle mac and cheese is something my husband dreams about (when he's not dreaming about me, of course... 8)   And their double baked potatoes are really yummy.   If you have room for dessert, try the baked alaska - its hog heaven for those of you that like ice cream.  The portions at this place are huge so sharing is recommended.

We really do love this place.  Just ignore the girls at the front door and have a couple of gimlets.  Everyone just seems nicer after that..."}
{"text":"The main descriptive word for this place: overpriced.  The place looks like a real steakhouse. the menu reads like a real steakhouse menu, but the quality is just not there.  The green corn pepper sauce was flavorless and the NY strip was just okay.  For $42 \"just okay\" is not good enough.  The shrimp cocktail was the only part of the meal that was exceptional. The service was poor.  We never even received four menus- we had the share two because the waitress was so distracted and lacking in her presentation.I would certainly recommend skipping Ocean Prime and heading over to Ocean Club, where the meal usually exceeds expectation."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday with family, was told we could sit in the lounge at a booth.  Arrived here at 5:00 which was our reservation time so we could enjoy happy hour, then was told by the waitress even though we were in the bar area happy hour is served at the actual bar and high top tables ONLY not the booths located in the bar area.  We were so disappointed, but then Lea to the rescue. Since it was a misunderstanding and my birthday they made an exception.  I ordered Halibut, yum, yum, it was tender and moist.  The only thing I wished I had realized they put a tomato puree on top, that was ok but I would have left that off since the fish was so fresh and tender.  The lobster ravioli was fantastic.  My favorite cocktail was Berries n Bubbles.  I will come again as I really want to try the happy hour menu which looked scrumptious as it passed by our table."}
{"text":"Better than the others!!!!!  Finally tried Ocean Prime this past weekend and WOW, we love it.  Better than Mastros and all the other steak houses in town."}
{"text":"I have been eating here since it opened.  The decor is stunning: the most elegant restaurant on High Street.  The back-lit bar is beautiful. We had Bloody Mary martinis to kick off the evening--perfectly made. The food is mixed--you will want to carefully select your fish items.  The crab cakes are world class.  Generous to a fault.  The one star on the menu.  The calamari was soggy: over-sauced in a spicy Asian medley of veggies and chili.  The shell fish salad was chock full of lobster and crab but not well integrated: the bleu cheese and egg and lettuce was coursely chopped and the dressing did little to elevate it."}
{"text":"Started at the bar.  Good service. Good happy hour prices. Everything went well. Went to the dining room to eat.  Was seated promptly and at a preferred booth. But after that we had no service until our food came. I asked for bread (I was a hungry man) and was told it was on it's way....but it wasn't. For 25 minutes I was waiting for bread and another drink, I know it I was 25 minutes because I was texting via timestamped messages. Neither was granted. Then our food came. It was good. Steak was slightly over cooked, but it I'm not going to count that against the review, shit happens. So overall food was good, service was lacking. Which was unfortunate because the dining room was what felt like not even half full. For $50 a plate I expected better."}
{"text":"Started in the bar and tried a free beers.  It's a small list,  but the wine list is better.  Moved to the dining room and had dinner.  Started with French onion soup, which was a B+. Ordered jalapeno au gratin, which was very good, but to oily.  Truffle mac and cheese was ok.  It was the wrong noodle for that sauce.  Noodles were too big and didn't hold the sauce right.  The steaks were near perfect! The service was awesome.  Overall I'll return!"}
{"text":"So enjoyed this venue last evening! Our group of twelve raved about the ambience, delicious cuisine, abundant adult beverage choices and the live music... Piano with Mark who features the lovely Emily on Thursday evenings! Whatever the genre, Emily did not disappoint! Some diners also took to the dance floor! Happy hour from 5:00-7:00 gave us an opportunity to partake of the small plates and become acquainted with the cuisine! We found the mahi tacos to be so tasty! Prime beef sliders were a hit at our table! Presentation of our choices was stellar. Wait staff seemed a bit unenthusiastic; however, it may have been a daunting task to serve our group of twelve! Must return..... Coffee and the ten layer carrot cake sounds decadent! It was a distinct pleasure spending more than three hours at this lovely establishment!"}
{"text":"Went to Ocean Prime during my last visit in Arizona.  Conveniently located 1 mile down the road from Marriot Desert Ridge.  Great décor and drinks, however it was likely the most overpriced, overcooked, and flavorless Ribeye I have ever eaten.  The remainder of my party was also disenchanted with their experience.  Definitely, have had better steaks at other establishments.  Would try a different steak house my next time in AZ."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a great dinner with family and friends. Great atmosphere. Loved the surf and turf meal. 8 oz steak with shrimp scampi and truffle Mac and cheese. Also enjoyed the creme brûlée. Staff was friendly as well."}
{"text":"Hello Az apparently this gem has been around for 9 years. What? 9 years and I just found out about it! This is a great place for Valentine's Day , wedding  anniversary , proposal , graduation and birthday dinner . Live entertainment , stellar staff and most importantly the food taste fantastic from appetizer to main course .  Casual nice to dressy attire .  As always when you go enjoy and let me know what you think ! Enjoy."}
{"text":"The restaurant was very fancy and the food was decent but definitely not worth the price. We had some oysters that were pretty good. Then the steak and king crab legs. The steak was sort of bland and the crab legs were half the size of what you'd get at Costco! So I was a little disappointed. The atmosphere was nice and the service was good which is why I gave it 3 stars. I wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"Went here for the Happy Hour. Prices are great for happy hour. Food was Great as well, however our service was terrible. We were there for an hour without getting our drinks. And food wasn't served for an hour and a half. We were with a big group, so this may have something to do with it. Definitely will try it again with a smaller group."}
{"text":"Prime Seafood and Steak? Oh yes land locked Arizonians, Ocean Prime's got both. This establishment brings the ocean to us desert dwellers with some tasty steak to boot. 

Decor - Bright neon blue lighting and modern clean lined architecture make up the interior. Ocean Prime screams class and sophistication. It's a swanky spot. The illuminated bar and wine cellar are both gorgeous, I want them in my home! Matt and I sat out on the intimate and dimly lit patio since it wasn't too uncomfortably hot outside. I also noticed that they had an outdoor fireplace for those cooler winter days. The tables throughout the interior and exterior looked comfortably well spaced. In the bar they had a musician performing live acoustic music, and I thought it was cool that they set up their speaker system so that the live music played throughout the entire restaurant.

Service - Upon arrival we received a happy and welcome greeting from the hostess. We were extremely well taken care of by our waitress the entire time, and also liked that the restaurant didn't mind our double fisting drinking style (when we go out, we'll generally order cocktails and a bottle of wine - sometimes waiters snicker at our booze hounding ways).

Food - I'm a San Francisco Seafood Snob. So if a desert seafood restaurant WOWs me, I'm floored. From the Restaurant Week menu, I picked the salad and salmon, Matt picked the French onion soup and filet mignon with bacon, we both decided on the 10-layer carrot cake for dessert. 

My salad included some tasty candied walnuts, and I appreciated the fact that it consisted of spinach instead of lame iceberg lettuce. That salmon I ordered must have swum right on to my place it was so fresh, flaky and meaty in taste. Topped with bread crumbs and surrounded by crisp snap peas in a soy butter sauce, this fish was top notch. 

Matt raved about his French onion soup, saying that the broth with onions at the bottom tasted flavorful and rich, the middle layer's crusty bread soaked up that tasty broth and the top layer of cheese was thick and perfectly browned to perfection. The fact that he downed an entire bowl of hot soup while sitting on a patio in warm Arizona weather speaks for itself!

Then there was that filet mignon that Matt ordered. Oh my goooodness! I am not a meat person by any means, but I tasted his filet and wow. I mean WOW! It melted in my mouth. That was one prime piece of meat.

The towering carrot cake was outstanding. Layer upon layer of the richest carrot cake I've ever tasted. It didn't have that yucky overwhelming carrot taste through, more like a subtle hit of it. However, it was the cream cheese frosting that made this cake so special - a creamy, buttery and sugary delight!

Another prime favorite of mine was the mojito they shook up. It met all of my mojito drinking requirements - muddled perfectly, bubbly, not too sweet, refreshing and very minty. 

This is a prime spot for all you fellow land locked seafood and steak lovers out there. Ocean prime goes above and beyond to provide a well rounded 5 star dining experience. Once my bank account recovers from the pricey bill, I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We went New Years Eve and we had the regular menu, regular prices and the same wonderful food. We Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Ocean Prime never disappoints. Had dinner here with a couple of friends last night. Service is always good, especially in the bar area. Love lounging over dinner or heavy apps while enjoying some live music and a game or two on TV.  Everything on the menu is very good.  Love a little surf and turf and a couple of excellent cocktails."}
{"text":"Awesome food great service we will be back. Try the risotto and the peanut butter and chocolate cake. Ask for Chad he is an awesome waiter."}
{"text":"I recently dined here with a friend and had a great experience! 

I love places that bring out bread right when you come in, so that was a great plus and a great start. We ordered one salad for both of us and they brought it out for us on separate plates already - so that was nice. 

I had the crusted trout and it was pretty good. I can't say it was divine, but I did enjoy it. The sauce that came with it was extremely good. 

I liked the service and how attentive the staff was. Although at one point I had 3 people ask me (within a matter of minutes) if they could take my plate...but I wasn't done with my food yet. That was kind of annoying...but no biggie. 

Ok...are you ready for the best part? The best part is that they make all their ice-cream and desserts in-house! We order the Alaskan something (forgot official name) and the peanut butter/chocolate thing. OMG! I can come back here everyday and eat just the dessert. 

The ice-cream that came inside the Alaskan thing was raspberry with chocolate chunks. The last time I had something similar was in Cincinnati, OH and I'm so excited to have found it in AZ. 

Overall great experience and we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Ok, this place started off with a major ace-in-the-hole.... we are really big fans of the Cameron Mitchell restaurants.  We've been to most of the different Mitchells concepts around Columbus and enjoyed them all.  In fact, I would put Columbus Fish Market among my all time favs.

To have a Mitcell's restarant in the neighborhood here in Phoenix was simply AWESOME!!!!

We went in and felt like we just walked into a South Beach place (ok, mountains instead of beach, but work with me). We loved it.  The greeting and wait staff were very friendly and attentive.

Then came the menu.  A bit more limited than what I remember from other places, but no biggy, there are still lots of decisions to be made.

I opted for salmon, wife the crabscakes.Everytthing was good, but not expcetional, and in the end didn't feel like a good value for the money, thus the missing star (almost 2 missing ones, but I couldn't bring myself to do it).  

I'll give it a shot again, but I'm in no hurry to go back.  Sadly, my search for great non-sushi fish in Phoenix continues..."}
{"text":"Caesar salad and the house salad were both very good with the house a bit better.
Blackened swordfish was very good and was the best of the 3 entrees we had.
Halibut Oscar was a little light on crab.
Pork Porterhouse was huge but not particularly flavorful.
Someone there highly recommended the Sunday dinner although the waitstaff downplay it for some reason (price maybe?).
Roy's is a better choice if you're in this area."}
{"text":"While in a work trip, Ocean Prime was thrown out as a suggestion. We all were quite impressed. We had great attentive service, phenomenal meals, and enjoyed the atmosphere. It wasn't too crowded and we were able to sit as a team and talk for a while! I personally had the 8oz filet and it was GREAT! The meat was super tender and cooked perfectly. We all loved it so much, we considered going back a second night in a row. It would definitely be somewhere I would return to when traveling back to Phoenix."}
{"text":"My wife and I celebrated our anniversary, as well as her birthday, at Ocean Prime. The table was decorated with rose buds and confetti. The service was exceptional, and the food was amazing. This is a beautiful restaurant, and a perfect atmosphere for dressing up and enjoying a night out. I want to thank the entire staff for their attention to detail. We were very impressed with the service. We highly recommend this restaurant. We will definitely be back soon. Thank you to Ocean Prime!"}
{"text":"Was very excited to try this restaurant as I had heard great things; however, was very disappointed after the meal.  I was with a party of four and none of us had a good experience.  All of the dishes were sold cold and the sides were not prepared well at all.  I ordered the filet with truffled butter and the steak was so cold, it was unabled to melt the solid chunk of cold butter.  Service was lack luster and slow.  We ordered creamed spinich was was gummy and the recommended jalapeno potatoes was flavorless.  This is a very expensive restaurant and i don't feel the value of the cost came close to matching the food."}
{"text":"Ocean Prime! My wife and I asked a few people at the J.W. Marriott which restaurant we should choose to celebrate our 25th Wedding Anniversary. After 3 independent recommendations we opted for Ocean Prime. Upon arrival the ambiance is beautiful and the staff very very friendly and responsive. Our table was decorated with beautiful red rose petals and the location was superb. Everyone in the restaurant serves you or attends to your needs. Our personal server (I wish I remembered his name) was outstanding, he checked in just enough for us to know he was being cautiously attentive. The menu is to die for, and each entree was better than the one which preceded it. It was nothing short of impressive. The salmon and Chilean sea bass was prepared to absolute perfection and I can't even think of an area of improvement. I tried...even as I observed the service of other patrons to see if we were receiving special treatment, and we were not, it's obviously their standard. The bill was $$$$ but with quality comes cost, we didn't even mind, it's a major milestone after all, so everything is relative. They even gave us our dessert complimentary for our celebration. The thought was everything to me and my wife. Loved this \"dining experience\" and when we return to Phoenix this will be a staple. Thank You Ocean Prime! and don't change."}
{"text":"We went to Ocean Prime early in the week around 7:00 pm and there was no crowd.  The food was excellent, my wife and I had the swordfish.  We also had our two kids 7 and 10, the staff was great with them, even gave them non menu item drinks (Gatorade that was meant for the cooks) and surprisingly the kids menu was very reasonably priced with $5.00 items."}
{"text":"I decided to take my mom for her birthday dinner and was hoping for an amazing evening since most can agree...moms deserve the best. As soon as you enter through the door the ambience is instantly amazing. Service was more then we could of asked for. Very attentive and always looking to go out of his way to make sure we were happy. 

We started dinner with martinis and appetizers. The calamari is a must try (different creative and delicious). I highly recommend the chilean sea bass, literally melts in your mouth and definitely the best i've had here in the valley. We got a few side dishes to share and investing in some jalapeno au gratin potatoes as well as the black truffle mac n cheese was definitely a good choice. 

After dinner and without even asking (simply letting the hostess now via reservations we were celebrating a birthday) we were brought a few of their desserts. I am still dreaming about their home made peanut butter pie yummy!

The staff was amazing they genuinely enjoy making sure guests receive the best experience possible. Thank you Daniel and Paul for making tonight a memorable one! Overall the best birthday dinner I could of asked for my mom and more :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic service and dining experience. They helped me surprise my Dad for his 80th birthday, everyone was so accommodating and happy to be in on the surprise. Every birthday or anniversary, this is where my parents insist on going! Thank You Ocean Prime for the outstanding service and the culinary feats you pull off!"}
{"text":"Our service was phenomenal.  Food is pretty good too. 
Lobster bisque-Fantastic
French Onion-WIfe had i tasted.  Very standard a little too salty.
DInner-Shared Ribeye, potatoes, and Brussels sprouts.  Everything was good.
Dessert-Shared Carrot cake.  It was ok.  I like mine moist-they make it dense. But it had good flavor.
Drinks-2 martinis and 1 cognac.  Made to perfection.

Ambiance-For the price point and level of the restaurant a view of the parking lot needs to better."}
{"text":"love love love! Love this place. Their dining room is great, love the outdoor seating. But I really enjoy just sitting in the bar area. When they have live music it's quite nice. Every single thing I have ordered on their menu has been phenomenal and their service is always amazing. The girls in the bar area are awesome and very pleasant.

Their happy hour menu is ridiculously awesome. Their pineapple martini and the one with the orchid floating in it-- amazing."}
{"text":"I've had the best roast chicken at this place and I know that's of for a steak and seafood place. But it was flawless. The seafood tower was amazing. Wonderful service. Going back next month."}
{"text":"We dined here to celebrate our anniversary on Friday evening.  We were warmly greeted and promptly seated at a booth that was decorated with rose petals.
Our waiter was  Thomas who we immediately liked: friendly, attentive, and not intrusive.  
Thomas couldn't have been nicer and made some great recommendations.
We ordered drinks and they brought out warm bread with whipped butter and filled our water glasses.
My wife ordered the sea bass and I ordered a NY strip steak.  We ordered 2 sides, mushrooms and corn.
All of the food came to the table HOT and everything was perfectly prepared.  
I don't recall a recent dining experience that was more enjoyable, the food was delicious and the service was first class.
The manager Tony came by our table 3 times to make sure we were happy and even extended his congratulations.
After dinner we decided to have a night cap in the bar area where they had 2 singers.
If you are looking for a restaurant to celebrate a special occasion,  Ocean Prime is the real deal."}
{"text":"was off from the start. smelled like rotten eggs inside. the shrimp looked great but was dry (was it old?). the halibut was not available because it wasn't 'up to the chefs standard.' and the sea bass was fishy, which was a first for me. for the money, not worth the risk -- go to ocean club nearby."}
{"text":"Omg!  The recommendation from our server, Shawn McGraw, was spot on! The lamb chops and the tuna tartare were out of this world! Can't even imagine a better recommendation!   If you can come here and have Shawn Mcgraw as your server, don't hesitate to ask for recommendations and wine pairs! This kid knows his stuff!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for Valentine's Day on a bit of short notice, and we are so glad we did! The food was absolutely unreal, with a really versatile menu, and the cocktails were pretty original and creative. On top of that, the service was as good as any restaurant I've ever been! I wish I could remember our waitresses name, but she was really nice and had such a great knowledge of their menu! The manager and even chef also stopped at our table at different points of the night and were just as friendly. It's a bit of a drive for us, but we'll still be happy to make this our new special date spot. I should also note that the menu seems a bit pricey, but when you compare your portion sizes to any fine dining places that I've been so far in Phoenix/Scottsdale, they win by a landslide! Worth every penny AND the slight discomfort of over eating."}
{"text":"Celebrated a special occasion here. Two of us ordered seafood dishes.  Both got sick in the middle of the night. Should have ordered steak like the others in our party - they were fine the next day.  Had seafood here once before when the restaurant first opened years ago. It too was bad.  Should have learned the first time. Will not make the same mistake again.  DO NOT eat the seafood!"}
{"text":"Fabulous customer service and food.  The manager came over to our table to make sure all was well, and everyone was very friendly and thanked us as we left.  The restrooms and dining rooms are well cared for and clean.  The food was great.  We particularly enjoyed the sushi rolls, but you can't go wrong with any of the selections on the varied and creative menu.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious meal. Our waiter, Thomas was friendly, helpful and provided excellent service. The crab cakes were amazing. Absolutely loved the Gouda tatertots and I usually don't eat tots. My sea bass was excellent. I can't say anything but great things about this place. My son devoured his filet. And the Brussels sprouts-YUM"}
{"text":"My husband and I had such a great experience at Ocean Prime this weekend. 

We where not expecting to go to a fancy restaurant as we had a reservation for painting down the street. We where both dressed in jeans and t-shirts however we where treated by the staff as if we where dressed to the 9s.

The good and drinks where excellent. Flavorful and enough to share but let's be honest, you can get a good steak at lots of restaurants. The real reason we will come back is the service. Our server Chad was knowledgable, cognizant of our time crunch, funny, helpful and really just a joy to be around. This is the first night out we have had in 2 years and Chad helped make it special.

We will be going back."}
{"text":"First visit & I won't be back. HH food prices are overpriced in my opinion. $8 for 2 pieces of average bruschetta, no thank you ill goto Postino instead. Had a gift card they wouldn't accept on cocktails??? Who does that? It was a gift! Much better places to go & enjoy."}
{"text":"Headed over to prime after enjoying a cigar at Torch with some friends. Food was great and service was great, as well.  We ate in the bar area which also had live entertainment , not too loud just right. Good looking place with a good crowd.."}
{"text":"This place is great! Went here for a birthday dinner. I just made a reservation and in the reservation I stated that it was a birthday celebration and to make it special. So when we arrived, the table was decorated with happy birthday confetti. We had Allie, she was so sweet and attentive. The food arrived promptly and was so delicious. The dessert was great. All around, I cannot wait to come back here."}
{"text":"Upscale, throw back vibe to when dining was an experience. The interior is spectacular, our favorite place to sit is in the bar, the glowing blue light really sets the mood for a relaxing ambiance, and we love the musicians that play. The happy hour is impressive, and the prices are unbelievable! The staff is fabulous, from the hostess, server, busboys, to the management, everyone is friendly and attentive...you really get the impression that everyone is invested in your dining experience. We have dined here many times, and they consistently exceed our expectations. For appetizers we have tried the calamari, goat cheese ravioli (my fave), and the fondue which I love. My favorire thing about our dining experience here is the fresh day boat seafood! Its such a treat to have fresh Halibut, the day after its caught in the ocean, in the middle of the desert! Steaks are phenomenal...Im not sure how they cook them, but something about it is different and special. I recommend Oscar style with asparagus, lump crab meat and bernaise, decadent but worth it! My favorite desert is the creme brulee, warm crunchy sugar crust on top with a cold creamy inside. Sides are delightful and ample enough for sharing, favorites are the jalapeno au gratin potatos, asparagus with hollandaise, and glazed carrots."}
{"text":"Came here for a Pharm Rep dinner and was highly impressed.  They had us in a private dining area and long story short all the items were perfectly portioned and had great flavor.  Salad was amazing, and that something I rarely say when talking about salads!  I went with the 8oz Filet Mignon cooked medium and was cooked right and seasoned well.  The other entrees looked just as good as well.  Tried both deserts, would warn that they are very rich and huge and would recommended saving some for later.  Service staff was attentive and friendly. 

They have a separate bar area to watch the game and mingle with others.  I came on a Thursday night and so the crowd seemed to be mostly older professionals in their early 30's - 50's and some families as well.  Would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"This is an upscale restaurant.  Always good service and great food!  We found this place from going to the Blue Martini and The Skinny Italian Kitchen next door."}
{"text":"Fabulous food and atmosphere.
Mark and Emily are really great entertainers in the Lounge.
Don't miss them!

{"text":"I chose to have my birthday dinner at Ocean Prime this year, and what a wonderful dinner it ended up being! We arrived hungry and agreed to start with the colossal shrimp in a tabasco cream sauce.  It was amazing. It came with a few slices of cheezy bread that was perfect for sopping up the sauce. I had the awesome twin lobster tails with asparagus for my entree and my man got the shrimp pasta. We also split the jalapeno scalloped potatoes. Wow. All I can say is that it was the best meal i have had in some time. Our server was great, the food incredible, and the atmosphere upscale but not pretentious at all. And the prices are pretty good.
We were also given a complementary dessert for my birthday that we would have never ordered otherwise (too full!) but managed to inhale anyway. The creme brulee was a large portion compared to most places, and was excellent. I'm now looking forward to returning when my mom comes to visit later this month!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere , super food , best wine list .... colossal size shrimp cocktail definitely coming back for more !!"}
{"text":"I have a weakness for steakhouses. I've actually been here more often than my check-in shows. It's perfect for birthday gatherings, client meetings, happy hour with my entourage, and even first and second dates. 

The ambiance is really lovely. It can be a blessing or curse that the lighting here is minimal. Just noting. Where do you go where you can have a palm tree situated next to you at dinner? Crazy to note but I love climbing trees, have a thing for palms because I am a desert dweller. Or perhaps my exit strategy...I prefer bar seating because it just invites a lot more perspective of any dining experience if you are into being a social butterfly. The outside patio is perfect entertainment watching the ongoers headed next door to the nightclub/bar, I myself included afterwards :)

Staff is always attentive without being intrusive but perfectly timed for those awkward moments. Food is incredible and their happy hour is generous with various selections to graze over before you devour an entire 3000 calorie meal. I don't there is anything I have not tried; hence I am not going to point out any item because you should try them all. The one star deficit is only because I have yet to experience this place ever busy with a high energy crowd. I am not necessarily into noise but certainly don't want to hear the sound of the crickets or my date's irregular breathing. A night here is just a great date no matter what."}
{"text":"I have a friend in Florida who loves to cook, and she makes the best blue crab bisque in the world.  If she were to meet me in Phoenix, I would take her to Ocean Prime.

We had a party of ten here a few months ago.  Everything off the menu was wonderful.  From the calamari and tuna tartare, to the colossal shrimp appetizer and the side dishes, we enjoyed a beautifully prepared meal.  Oh yes, the entrees were excellent, too.  I shared the seabass with a co-worker; we both thought it was very good.  Oh yes, we sampled several of the desserts, too.  The chocolate peanut butter pie was a huge hit for all of us (and we were all from around the country).  Oh yes, and then there were the drinks...the Cloud 9 martini started at one end of the table and ended up being served many times over until everyone at the table had their own one or two -- or three.

The servers were nice and handled our group (jokes and all) with aplomb.  It was a memorable meal with a memorable group of people.  As other Yelpers have mentioned, Ocean Prime has an impressive, modern interior with a an upscale bar area and very cool outdoor seating.  Guys, a perfect place to bring a special someone."}
{"text":"Always love going to Ocean Prime for the great happy hour wine prices!  I've never been disappointed with the service or food.  If you are on High Street and in the mood for an upscale meal, definitely give it a try!  Bar area is huge, live music on the weekends, it's a solid performer when it comes to getting what you pay for."}
{"text":"From food to service this was a 5 Star experience. Let me start with the crab cakes for an appetizer. I am from the Chesapeake area and have not been able to find good crab cakes in Arizona. These were phenomenal!  My fiancé got the snapper and I got the filet lobster au gratin style. Both were delicious and perfectly cooked. 

Shawn was our server and he was fantastic. He described each special with just the right amount of details and provided the perfect suggestions. He made a special evening just that much better. 

Overall the experience and food exceeded our expectations. Make sure you save room for the carrot cake!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and music. Superb service! Very reasonable happy hour. Excellent food and awesome drink selection."}
{"text":"We went to Ocean Prime the other night and it was delicious.  I don't know if it was worth the money but it was definitely good.  The setting is as attractive as any restaurant I can remember, with classical contemporary decor and a very cool display of alcohol bottles in the bar.

I was in a party of seven and the prevalent dish was the bone-in filet.  We had heard it was better than the steakhouses in Chicago.  Well I'm from Chicago, and trust me, you get a better (and bigger) bone-in filet at Joe's.  But it was still a delicious steak.  The sides were terrific and the salads were good too.  But those prices!  Wow, value is not this restaurant's strong suit.

About the only other thing I'll add is the service was below average, a concern considering what the prices were like.  Our server tried hard but he was too slow and didn't get our order right."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! We have eaten at several high end steakhouses and Ocean Prime is the best. Earlier this week we ate at Mastros which was good, but OP was definitely better. Our table had 3 filets, which were cooked to perfection. Not to mention the service was outstanding. The GM is the best!! Very personable and always wants your visit to be memorable. Highly recommend OP, when in the area. If possible, start with the tater tot app and save room for the Warm butter cake dessert. Delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic steak. Delicious filet with truffle butter. Incredible service. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"What a great meal!  My wife has some restrictions, and they were so accommodating! Very expensive, but for a great meal, i would suggest it!"}
{"text":"Another lousy phoenix restaurant. We had a couple of appetizers and did not even get to the entrée because we were so disgusted with how awful the appetizers were.

It was a Friday night at 8 PM, the place was empty which should've been my first clue. We sat in the bar where there was live music. With all the great talent in Phoenix, they had to choose a Duo that used a synthesizer and played very outdated music. Not a good experience. We will definitely not be back."}
{"text":"When average five star food with three star service, you get a four star review.  We recently went to OP for a family occasion.  There is no question that the food was top notch.  That said, when the chef (and the waiter) forgot about a French onion soup that left under the broiler to the point of morphing into an inedible crisp, followed by nearly 20 minutes to bring the coffee was ordered for dessert, and lastly, an inability to find our waiter for so long to give him our credit card that we flagged down a waiter from another section, the service had a more lasting memory than the food.  Perhaps it was an issue of being understaffed, but the reality is that at this price point, sub par service is not acceptable and is something that will cause me to patronize the abundance of OP's competitors that are in the same genre.  To sum it up, the food was well done, but the service was medium rare at best."}
{"text":"Great steaks and seafood. Live music is amazing. Happy hour is the best for High Street!"}
{"text":"Tried Ocean Prime for the first time when we had friends visiting from out of town during the holidays. Atmosphere is nice, but food was alright. I ordered the scallops dish which was good, but nothing spectacular. Also tried the NY steak and it was just ok. We also tried the calamari, it was a little different and not your typical calamari dish. Would I go back, possibly but it's not on top of my list."}
{"text":"I've eaten in most, if not all, of the Mitchell restaurants and this one certainly exceeded my high expectations. Super wine list, we had The Prisoner, and attentive service of Kristin made for an excellent dining experience. When I reported that my French Onion soup was good but l would choose the Bisque next time, a manager appeared within moments to offer an exchange. But Deb raved about how much she loved my onion soup and I was happy to finish it with her help. Deb had King Salmon, I had scallops and we each had a salad. Baked Alaska is on the way. The surroundings are very attractive, we sat at a C-booth in the bar area, and the music track was a blend of older and newer hits. We will return here on every visit and I recommend Ocean Prime to everyone, especially my dearest friends."}
{"text":"We had our first visit to Ocean Prime on Saturday night.  Celebrating our 6th wedding anniversary we wanted to try somewhere new PLUS it was AZ Restuarant Week and who could resist the $58/couple dinner when normally an entree-no sides-cost $31!  

We often visit other places like Ocean Prime such as Flemmings, City Hall & Mastros but in all honesty I like those places MUCH better.

The hostess greeted us in a friendly manner and when I told her our name she said \"Happy Anniversary\" (thanks opentable.com) We arrived about 45 minutes for our reservation and they said it would be closer to our reservation time before we sat down but we could have a seat in the lounge.  Fine with us.  The lounge was nice-they have a gentleman playing a piano (and electric guitar) and I thought that was a nice touch.  We each ordered a glass of wine and chatted.  A few minutes later a gentelman (Walter) came and informed us that they had a table for us.  We proceeded to follow him back thru the entry into the dining room.  He stopped and apologized and said \"Well I thought we had a table but it appears not.  Please wait here for a moment.\"  So there we stood with our glasses of wine in the lobby.  Not really a big deal since it only took another minute and he found us a table.  I had asked for a more private table since the dining room is a little loud but instead we were seated right smack in the the middle of the dining room.  

We sat down and the \"dining assistant\" came over and filled our water glasses, told us his name and said he'd bring us fresh bread while we waited for our server-David.

David arrived about 5 minutes later and asked if we needed any drinks-we had full glasses of wine.  And then said he'd go get us some fresh bread and allow us a few minutes to look over the menu.  

David came back about 10 minutes later and took our order-no bread in hand and the dining assistant seemed to have disappeared.  Order was taken and off David went.  Another 7-10 minutes when by, no bread no one asking if we needed anything.  

We snagged David and asked if he could bring out the bread and while my husband was speaking to him David turned and scurried off.  We didn't appreciate his dismissivness at all.  He was getting on our nerves.

Bread and salads came.  Ceasar salad was a little lemony for my taste but still pretty good.  Hubby had an empty glass of water for about 15 minutes now and another waiter happily accomodated hubbys request for more water. Walter happened to walk by and we flat out asked for a new waiter.  Here came David with our meals so we didn't get the opportunity to fully explain to Walter the issue.  

Shortly after a nice, PERSONABLE gentleman named Frank came by and informed us he would be taking care of us from then on.  He was great-attentive, knowledgeable and tried to turn our experience around.

Which he did.  Since the menu was fixed but I wasn't crazy about the desserts offered I asked if I could make a change and he let me-had the Warm Chocolate Cake and it was AMAZING!  Our 7 oz filets were also very good as well as the asparagus with Hollindase sauce.

Frank did an excellent job and I thank him for being such a great waiter!  Also thanks to Walter for getting us a new server so promptly.  However, they do only get 3 stars because of our initial experience AND for the fact that they knew it was our anniversary and I felt like they could've done a little more to make our experience a little better.

By the way, the decor is great.  In the future, I think if having the option to go to OP, Flemmings, City Hall or Mastros, OP would be last on my list."}
{"text":"As a party of seven we were seated quickly on a Thursday night. The service was fair, but nothing to write home about. Our waiter was particularly unaccommodating w/r/t any changes including party size and billing changes. The plating was simple without flourish. The seasoning was overdone which detracted from the quality of the meat and fish. Vegetarians beware as this restaurant is not veg friendly. The carrot cake was overly sweet and lacked in flavor complexity. This is a good spot for those with less adventurous palates."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by saying that it is hard for me to give any Cameroon Mitchell restaurant a bad review since it used to be the standard of creativity and perfection I grew up on and loved. I lived in Columbus and Cap City was one of my favorite spots to date. I even had my wedding rehearsal dinner at The Fish Market (before he sold it to Ruth Chris). I love Cameroon Mitchell restaurants and when I heard that one was coming to the valley my husband and I were thrilled! We went a week after opening and since it was a while ago I can't give you specific details but I remember that that calamari was made exactly the way it was made at Cap city which was fantastic! We did have issues with our server taking over a half our to bring our soup. The carrot cake was also very similar to Cap City and since it was always my favorite, I was in heaven. I wasn't thrilled with that visit due to the long looooong wait for our soup then meals but I chalked it up to being a new restaurant. 

We hadn't been back in a while (due to distance) so we tried to make reservations for New Years Eve. They were booked so no biggie we decided to go on Sunday instead. I've never been more disappointed in my food expectations! The calamari had changed completely. It was not terrible but not what I wanted (candied cashews?) and our entrees were sub par. My Sea bass tasted like it was seasoned with Lowery's season salt and was undercooked. My husbands swordfish was OK but again.... not what we were expecting after eating at The Fish Market for years. I love sweet potato fries and ours were soggy. I have had better ones ones at Outback, Le Chatlet, and at Arrowhead Grill. Maybe it was crappy because all the chiefs were hung over from new years day? I couldn't really say but for $130 bill for an app, a side, and 2 entrees that were very blan I would go elsewhere! As for the Cameroon Mitchell chain... looks like I will have to fly back to Columbus to enjoy the perfection."}
{"text":"Ocean Prime is a upscale restaurant and lounge that serves a modern slightly global menu of seafood, prime steak, cocktails and an impressive wine list. This is an award winning restaurant group that has had the honor of cooking at the James Beard House. There are several locations of this restaurant across the U.S.A. and one in Naples. Ocean Primes are usually located in upscale and or resort sort of areas. This Ocean Prime is located on High Street by the Desert Ridge Marketplace.

My review is only based on one brunch visit. I thought it was GREAT that Ocean Prime was offering a reasonably priced Brunch. It's just so nice to go to a really nice restaurant every now and then. Most really nice places offer brunches on holidays that are so expensive. Not Ocean Prime....Their brunch is quality and very reasonable. 

We arrived and were greeted by a few people at the hostess desk that welcomed us and took us to our table. I noticed a reserved sign on a table that read \"Reserved For Angelina Jolie\" and for a minute I thought gosh, Is Angelina Jolie on her way to Phoenix?....NO it was sort of a joke. My table had a sign that read \"Reserved For Bette Davis.\"....so funny LOL. 

Our table was nice and set with crisp linen, sparkling glassware and shiny silverware. The dining room is sort of classic and rich with leather and dark wood. But they also have modern bright features that round things out.

I ordered the Blackened Salmon Salad. I got a good sized piece of nicely spiced and crisp salmon cooked to a perfect medium. The fish seemed like it was very fresh and had a great texture that just melted in my mouth. On the side was a fresh mixed green salad adorned with creamy goat cheese, cantaloupe, candied walnuts and sweet grapes. It was just the right size for brunch.

My husband had the Crab Cakes with Poached Eggs topped with Hollandaise Sauce. His plate also came with fresh fruit and a side salad. The grilled crab cakes were very good...much better than from most places.....It's very hard to get a good crab cake outside of Baltimore. The rest of his plate was good but not perfect....The plate sat under a heat lamp and the salad and fruit were warm. Eggs and sauce seemed slightly cooked by the lamp. We might have told our waiter if he checked on us but he didn't. 

We also shared the side of Black Truffle Mac and Cheese. It was a great portion for sharing. It had nicely prepared pasta in a creamy, cheesy sauce with pieces of real truffle. We both thought if was excellent for the price point.

As we left several crew members thanked us for dining there and wished us a good day."}
{"text":"As advertised this is a nice place. Beautiful spot on the end of city north.
I was there for a business dinner this week and had an overall good experience. The service was good, food tasty, and had some fun people watching. I actually had steak, just In that mood that night. The filet was yummy and cooked perfectly. The sides were fine but nothing spectacular.

Is this place better than ocean club? I don't think so. But it was a solid meal. I would not hesitate to go back."}
{"text":"First time here, thanks to restaurant week, and it won't be my last!

Ocean Prime is a white modern looking structure with blue neon lights.
We sat out on the patio which has a beautiful fireplace and the architecture of the patio ceiling is really neat. They incorporated two circles into the ceiling to allow the palm trees to grow through. The patio door and wall is all glass and looks as though it can be slid off to the side to open up the restaurant when the weather gets cooler. The bar at the back is neatly lit with all the liquor bottles and I did see a separate area labeled \"blu lounge\" that must be their sports bar section cause 2 different TV's were seen, however I did not venture back there so the \"sports bar\" description may be inaccurate. 

Our server, Kristin, was very welcoming and quick with service. I started out with a candied walnut salad with goat cheese that was delicious and my friend got the Caesar salad which she enjoyed because she said the flavor wasn't over powering. My entree was the filet mignon that I asked to be cooked medium rare and WOW, did they do an amazing job. It was by far one of the best filet's I have every eaten, it just melting in my mouth. My friend ordered the crab encrusted talipia that was equally as delicious. We split the brown sugar glazed carrots as a side, need I say more? We both ended up with the creme brulee and both savored in the sweet goodness and thickest layer of caramelized sugar coating I have every seen (but greatly appreciated).

The only negative I have to mention is that the patio chairs are wood and thus super uncomfortable (my right buttcheek went numb at one point), but it was well worth the tastiness I experienced.  Ocean Prime is an upscale dining restaurant and I will be returning, but only for those special occasions due to my unfortunately limited wallet size :)"}
{"text":"Spent Father's Day dinner at this incredible restaurant! Everything from the perfect service by waiter Thomas to the scallops and prime rib - both spot on! Drinks, appetizer- biggest shrimp cocktail I have ever seen!, seafood chopped salad, the entrees listed above and finally warm butter cake! All were delicious!  The ambiance is casual yet upscale and beautiful. Thank you for a wonderful way to celebrate an incredible FATHER! We will be back A special thank you to chef Jagger Griffin!!"}
{"text":"Friday night date night -- My wife said \"anything but a steakhouse\" - So I thought seafood!

We had never been here before - nor had even heard of it. I picked it on the basis of the yelp reviews - mostly positive. We showed up to an empty restaurant, on a Friday night at 6:30pm, this had me a little worried. Never eat in an empty restaurant, right? But we had our pick of any table - we picked a booth with a view of the fireplace/patio.

WOW - a live band! How cool is that! The song selection was awesome. The artists put their touch on almost every song they sang, making for great entertainment.

Our only disappointment (and the loss of a star) was the Seafood Platter/Tower - at almost $100 (Market Pricing) - I would have expected allot more. We have had these at most other places and this one just seemed \"skimpy\" on the amount of seafood.

In the end - the restaurant was busy. People showed up. Band was lively. Overall we enjoyed our first experience at the restaurant. I liked that it wasn't super packed and the service was great."}
{"text":"Was pretty excited to eat there after reading a few of the reviews and the pictures.  Every place can have a night off this was one of them with some wins. My friend had the lamb and it was very good. I had the halibut and it was very over done. Had I not wanted to ruin the evening with my friend who rarely gets to eat at nicer places, I would have made a bigger point of it. However, I did mention it was dry and over cooked to the waiter and barely got an acknowledgement.  Appetizer was awesome, bread was great and the spinach side was good.   Service very average for a 150 dollar plus tip meal with no alcohol. I won't be going back ....way too many places to go at that price point."}
{"text":"Ocean Prime is around several other shops and restaurants in the upscale area (Blue Martini next door).  The ambiance is sleek and stylish.  I have had the pleasure of dining here a couple of times now with large groups. This week we had dined in one of the private rooms.  The wine list is excellent with lots of familiar Napa wines.  The seafood appetizers were fresh, the filet was tender with a nice slight grilled crust.  The mashed potatoes and lobster mac and cheese were delicious and rich.  The service was on point. I believe we had two or three servers there taking care of our party.  Enjoyed the dining experience at Ocean Prime."}
{"text":"Service was outstanding from the hostess to the waiter to the bus guys.  The food was wonderful...except I don't get the mac and cheese - it's mac and cheese - that's all. For an $11 side, I'd skip next time.  I'd also be careful of their wine list - very high and not as good a list of wines as the prices would suggest (Souverain Sauvignon Blanc retails for $14-16 per bottle, FGS).
BUT, the food was wonderful - everything done properly and nicely plated.  Good experience."}
{"text":"I was looking for an amazing restaurant for my husband and I to celebrate our anniversary and Yelp suggested this gem. I had known about High Street but had never visited before so I had no idea this place even existed. The restaurant itself was on the corner and had an amazing fireplace surrounded by outside dining. However, since we had a reservation, we were taken into the main dining room and given a booth.  Being that it was the evening before Thanksgiving, there weren't that many people in the restaurant.
We each began with a soup choice and we both had a filet. Hubby had the french onion and I had the lobster bisque. They were so very delicious and the fillets were perfectly tender and the toppings were amazing additions to an already wonderful cut of beef. For dessert I had to try the 12 layer carrot cake, but after so much delicious food I had to take it home to devour the next day. Which I did. For breakfast.
I was very interested to try many of the other items on the menu and will definitely return as often as my pocketbook can handle it.
If you are celebrating a special event, I would definitely recommend Ocean Prime."}
{"text":"Happy hour goes from 5-7pm! That alone should give Ocean Prime a double thumbs up, because who can get to HH in the common 4-6pm time frame and a majority of the time, people are scrambling to get out of work early enough. 

Lesley, our server, was super attentive! After I had my typical go to, The Old Fashioned, which was good, I searched for something different so she suggested the Pine Fin Martini. They infuse their Finlandia Vodka with freshly cut pineapple which made for a cool refreshing simple cocktail.

So starting with the HH menu:
The $8 appetizers we ordered included..
Tuna Tartare Tacos - fresh tuna in ginger ponzu, avocado blanketed in thin crispy tacos (the type of crispy on crab wantons). Can't really go wrong ordering these. 

Oysters - cute little oysters served on ice. Little and \"oystery\" in flavor. 

The $5 appetizers we had..
Parmesan truffle fries - mild truffle taste. Maybe too mild?

Imported meat and cheese platter - good typical platter with 3 types of cheese. I had to guess which ones though since no description was included.

Kobe beef sliders - I don't recall if there was anything unique about the taste because there were only 2 of them and I ate mine in 3 bites. I remember it being good. 

Off the main menu, my friend and I split the:
Sea Scallop entree with Parmesan risotto - the scallops were pillowy and appeared to be lightly seared. Tender bites with not one hint of chewy texture. Lightly salted and buttered. The risotto had a hint of citrus in its sauce which was also very mild, so you had to almost pause and think about the citrus taste. 

I'd like to return here with my hubby for dinner sometime. I've heard great things about their steaks/meats here. From sharing the scallop entree with my friend and enjoying the tuna tartare and oysters, you can tell the seafood is indeed fresh. I felt like a lot of the HH appetizers served their job as \"higher end\" favorites but not super unique in any way. They tasted really good but looking over the appetizer menu on the main menu, one could tell a lot more heart and creativity was placed there. The entrees on the main menu appear to use unique ingredients that enhance the flavor of the meats and seafoods available without overpowering them. I can't wait to try them and see if my predictions are true!"}
{"text":"This will be short and simple! 

Amazing food, amazing ambience with the piano man playing. Hostess was a bit bitchy and didn't say a word when we walked in or when she seated us. Told her I had a reservation for four, she looked at me (up and down) and then grabbed a few menues and rushed us to a cramped booth. 

Our server had more of a personality and was great, until we all decided to move to the music room and the server there was 15 minutes too long in even noticing us as we sat. REALLY? There was us and two other tables. HOW HARD CAN IT BE! Oh wait, that's because she and Miss bitchy bitch hostess were too busy playing chatty cathy at the hostess station. 

Sigh"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Ocean Prime for our anniversary dinner. The service and ambience were excellent.  We shared the chop chop salad which was very good .  My wife's choice was the swordfish which was cooked perfectly.  I had the sea scallops and they were melt-in- your-mouth delicious.  The risotto the scallops sat on was creamy and rich.  Dessert was the 10-layer carrot cake, which was more than enough for the two of us.  Thanks for making our anniversary dinner a special one!"}
{"text":"WEnt for Happy Hour again and had a great booth, felt fancy but was still causal at the same time. Ordered from both regular menu ( halibut and ribeye) and they were both fantastic as well as lamb, lobster roll and other happy hour items. All were excellent, probably ribeye and lamb my two favorites. My kids loved the place as well and our server, Savanna (sp) was great, even comping us a free desert."}
{"text":"High end costs, with high end food.

What is so deliciously refreshing about this place, however, is that they serve up generous portions of food. Something that I rarely see at high end eateries these days. 

And when you pay 40-50$ a plate... there is nothing worse then leaving without being full. Which is why I was so happy to get such a fat portion of lip-smacking sea-bass. Very impressed.

...Also the PB and chocolate dessert (highly recommend) was literally enough for 4 people."}
{"text":"The crab cake was perfect, sauce amazing and unique flavor.

I had the berry martini with the dry ice which was amazing but extremely sweet.

Nice wine list.

Decor was nice the only think I didn't like was the blue neon lights. I thought it was very eighties/tacky"}
{"text":"One of our favorite happy hour spots!  The king crab dip is delicious! They usually have live music either jazz or a Sinatra style flow.  The staff is very attentive and their complimentary popcorn is yummy!  My wife loves the infused bubbles drink and they have local beer.   We never go unless it's happy hour, but they usually don't disappoint."}
{"text":"Called ahead to make sure there would be no problem getting a table around 8 pm. Was informed that it would be no problem and to come on in. Showed up at 8:10 and was told that the kitchen was closing and that me and my date could not dine in. Very disappointed, with the communication here probably won't try to come back."}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant. While the regular menu is great, I think the happy hour is really the hidden gem. Excellent drinks and food for $5! It's not the random drinks and apps that no one orders, it's the good stuff."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and staff.  Good was a little spendy for the quality.  However you're paying for the environment, which is fabulous.   I will say the crab cakes were some of the best I have had, outside of Maryland."}
{"text":"Wow.  I really wanted to give this restaurant five stars.  I did.  Really.  But I just can't.  I'll explain why at the bottom.  First off, the decor is lovely.  The wait staff was just the right amount of attentive, without being intrusive.  The location is excellent, and the parking attendents were spot on.  When I say the location is excellent, I guess that is my bias being from the north end of town.  The little shopping enclave this is located in is very upscale, and was prettily sparkling when we were there on Wednesday.  I had the filet, with bearnaise sauce, while my wife had the blackened swordfish.  Both were excellent.  The swordfish was actually better than my steak, and my steak was excellent.  The espresso was first rate, and the chocolate creation my wife had for dessert she raved about.  I think it was called chocolate passion.  Their wine list is quite good (we had the White Star, which of course was, well White Star).  This is not an inexpensive dinner, but neither was it at the upper end either.  (for 2, with the champagne, was $240 with tip).  

Now, the reason for the 4 stars.  First, the appetizer: shrimp cocktail.  3 incredibly large shrimp in perfect cocktail sauce.  But the shrimp were a tad chewy.  Then there was my steak, which was delicious, it just wasn't cooked as I had asked.  I had asked for medium, but got medium rare.  I don't mind medium rare, and it was delicious, just not what I asked for.  And lastly, there was no escargot on the menu.  That's pretty much a staple for a top notch restaurant in my book."}
{"text":"Customer service at the bar is terrible. Friendly bartenders but are too preoccupied talking to each other than serving upon their customers. Takes 10 minutes to get a drink on days when you have 2-3 bar tenders behind the bar and the restaurant not even quarter full! You ask for something and up goes the bartender to get you the item and then suddenly gets sidetracked in a conversation or another order and you are forgotten. This is not the first time - this is pretty much the experience every single time! They have 2 senior managers that should be paying attention to service at bar but they stand around and often engage in conversations that sidetrack the bartenders! I suggest to the managers to hold a 5-minute morning talk before bar opens and talk about importance of customer service!

Patrons -  If you are coming here for a drink - I suggest you skip and go right next door to Blue Martini where service at bar is much better!"}
{"text":"Great place for Dinner or Happy Hours. We have been there many times the waiters and waitresses are very nice and very pleasant and are eager to please. Like the piano bar that's there with nice soft music it's a place where you can talk and not have real loud music."}
{"text":"I love trying out new places to eat so my boyfriend surprised me with dinner here for our anniversary. We sat in the booth area where they played live music but if you prefer more of an intimate dinner there is seating on the other side of the restaurant where it's more quiet. 
We started off with the Sweet Chilli Calamari    which was different but delicious!!!
I had the Sea Scallops with Parmesan Risotto and my boyfriend got the Blackened Swordfish with cornbread and jalapeño tartar. The main dishes don't come with sides so we also got a side of the Black Truffle Mac and Cheese . I personally didn't care for it. I normally love Mac and cheese but the taste was blah and it was over priced. 

Overall we enjoyed our first experience at the restaurant .. I liked that it wasn't super packed and the service was good. The price of the food is a bit over priced but was expected."}
{"text":"Always looking for a good steakhouse experience.  I always struggle with mall based restaurants. However, once inside the attention to interior design and detail sets the stage for a great dining experience. Per many other reviews I confirm this place is loud and I mean LOUD! If you are attempting to have a deep conversation or have members in your party who are hearing impaired I suggest a private dining room or another dining location. Thankfully we were able to move our party of eight to one of the private rooms.

With a private room we were provided with a dedicated waiter, so we thought. Our server while knowledgable of the menu copped a bit of an attitude. This was ok at first but became an more irritating as he decided that his guaranteed gratuity was reason to focus his attention on other guests. Word to the wise for all wait staff and service captains, when a party is going to spend  close to $2000 over a two hour period and you will reap the benefit of a minimum gratuity of $180 your focus should be greater than 90% and your main goal should be to make your guest feel like they are your only guests.

The menu provides a solid offering of steak options with a supporting cast of reasonable beef alternatives.  Despite my passion for a great steak I settled on the Sea Bass as one of my table mates agreed to a surf and turf share. Despite previous reviews that were critical of the fish quality and preparation, we both found the fish to be fresh, moist and flavorful. The steak had good flavor and was prepared to perfection but was simply a good cut of beef.  Steak houses pride themselves on side dishes and the selection here was robust but the execution was weak. The truffle Mac and cheese was over cooked and our group struggled to find the bold taste of truffle. The culinary star of our evening was the seafood tower, we consumed two. Robust quantity of fresh crustacean and mollusks presented in an eye popping manner.

Wine list was robust and had something for everyone.  Pricing was typical for a hight end restaurant. If you know wines you can find bottles that are great plate pleasers for $15 per glass. If you are a bourbon drinker forget it, one choice and a speed rail dweller on a good day. Desserts choices had something for everyone."}
{"text":"Had an excellent business dinner while in the area for a conference.  Lobster bisque and filet mignon with an added blue cheese crust were excellent, cooked just as requested.  Server talked up the smoked Gouda tater tots as a side dish, I was unimpressed."}
{"text":"Great service and great dinner. Always great food here.

On this particular occasion, I started the night with gin martini. Just asked exactly what I wanted and they made it happen. I heard their signature drink is some pink bubbly martini. I saw it, it was instagrammable but I heard too sweet.

My favorite appetizer here is giant shrimps. I mean really huge! Can't believe it's shrimp. Three shrimps per serving but since it's so big, nice to share.

Can't go wrong with any of the main dish here, steak is of course good but their seafood, my favorite Alaskan cod is very meaty and good as well.

Great wine selection, the one I had on this night was so good, I added to my favorite wine list.

Don't forget to leave room for desert. All the desert I tried so far is very good. Nice way to end great dinner.

They have several private rooms available for a party."}
{"text":"Probably the most disappointed I have been at a restaurant in a long time.  Have eaten here numerous times and even hosted several holiday parties for my company's staff here so I thought it was a good bet but I was wrong.  We stopped in after attending a concert and were promptly seated at a dinner table in the bar.  That was really the only good thing that happened.  Once seated we were presented with menus and asked if we wanted to order drinks.  We needed a minute to look at the wine list so off our server went.  She came back and asked if we were ready to order drinks and appetizers.  We had been there about two minutes at this point so had no time to even look at the menu yet.  Off she went to get drinks which came back a couple minutes later.  Beers were not even close to full and wine poor was average.  Now it was \"I am sorry I lost track of time and the kitchen is closing so if you want to order food you have to do it now.\"  Really, you sit us down for dinner and within five minutes you are telling us the kitchen is closing - actually according to our waitress the kitchen closed before we even sat down.  It would have been much better to give us that heads up coming in so we could have gone somewhere else.  We should have left but now had drinks so that was not practical.  We rushed through our dinner selections and off she went.  The appetizers came out very quickly and were quite good.  The calamari was excellent and the scallops and short ribs were very good also.  Salads came out before the appetizers were half done and we were being constantly asked if we were done with plates by our server and every bus boy that walked by.  Very very annoying and ruining the experience.  Dinner came out right when we finished the appetizers and salads.  I had ordered the $46 ribeye and it was warm at best, cooked unevenly and very fatty (even by ribeye standards).  Probably the first steak I haven't finished since I was 10 years old.  Not worth the calories.  The sides we ordered were also luke warm.  Clearly they had cooked everything in a hurry and as we tried to enjoy our dinner at a moderate pace they let the food sit.  Should have sent it back but given that the kitchen was obviously closed that would have done no good.  Now our server is coming by every 3 to 4 minutes looking to clear plates.  Before we are even close to finishing our meal, they turn the lights up and start cleaning the restaurant.  Lastly, our server comes to the table and drops off the bill before we are done and never offers any kind of desert.  We were in and out in 45 minutes.  Not really the experience I think anyone would want even at a Denny's let alone a high end restaurant on a Friday evening.  None of us will ever go back.  It was bad from start to finish - bad service, bad food, bad atmosphere and at a high end price.  If you are looking for a quality dining experience, I would suggest Dominicks in north Scottsdale, Durants in central Phoenix or Cartwrights in Carefree all of which know how to treat customers and not mislead them."}
{"text":"The Halibut (when in season) blackened with buerre blanc sauce is SO good. Also the jalepeno au gratin potatoes are incredible. Really nice people and a nice place too."}
{"text":"Went for our anniversary, Our table had rose petals scattered over it (Nice touch) And the name plates were funny. Our server was nice and knowledgable. Both my wife's lobster  & my steak were really good. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I heard about a singer performing in the bar area last Saturday night so I decided to give Ocean Prime a chance. The bar area was not crowded but lively and the perfomance by Kaitlin Jones and the pianist, Mark? were awesome! The entire bar joined in on a couple of songs and the selection of music was perfect. We had a fun time and the drinks and food were delicious."}
{"text":"I went to Ocean Prime a couple of times when it first opened.  Honestly I wasn't impressed enough to go back, especially given that there is a top notch fish restaurant not too far away.

We ended up here for a friend's birthday and my sorrow quickly turned to joy.  This place has changed and I see they have upped their game.  Service was good.  Wine list had some nice choices and the food was good.  

Crab cakes were great.  Scallops cooked perfectly and the swordfish was a great dish.  I've put this place back on my list of places to go.

My only complaint is that if you are gonna offer a moscow mule then it should be in a copper cup."}
{"text":"Finally, I made it to Ocean Prime...

I'd been wanting to try it for months, and Saturday night it finally happened.  We couldn't get a reservation since it was Restaurant Week, but we took our chances and found the perfect spot at the bar.  Natalie, the bartender / server was awesome... I'd go back again and again to hang with here at the beautiful bar if only it wasn't so pricey or if the food was deserving of the prices... not exactly the case.

Jared went for the three course Restaurant Week menu.  For $29, he had their house salad, a 7 oz filet, and sorbet for dessert.  I didn't find anything on that menu quite as appealing as the Chilean Sea Bass off the regular menu, so I splurged and went for that despite the $32 price tag.  I also ordered a side of steamed broccoli for $8.

We were offered fresh bread but declined it... our wedding is just a few weeks away, so no need for extra carbs!

Jared's salad came out pretty quickly and he shared a few bites with me - we were off to a good start - we cleaned the salad plate!  Next up, Jared's filet arrived with my side of broccoli.  The server who delivered it put both plates in front of Jared and said \"anything else I can get you?\"  We both answered at the same time \"just my (her) sea bass.\"  He then went to check on it.

Ten minutes later, my sea bass came out.  It looked good but when I went to cut into it, it was tough.  Now, I've had my fair share of sea bass - it's my favorite fish.  I've never had tough sea bass before.  Needless to say, we sent it back.

Just as Jared finished his meal and we finished the broccoli together, the GM, Walter, came by to apologize.  He told us they were preparing a fresh piece of sea bass for me.

When he asked if he could bring me anything else, I said sure... (I really wanted to try the glazed carrots).  It was awhile, but my new sea bass came out awhile later, as did the glazed carrots - and both were tasty.  Not amazing, but good.  Lucky for us, they ended up comping my sea bass and carrots.  

Jared's lemon sorbet was served after I finished up... it was a generous two scoops.

So, what would have cost around $100 on a typical night was half the price due to the *off* sea bass.  Would I do it again for full price?  Probably not... but if someone else is footing the bill, sure - I'll give OP another shot."}
{"text":"We arrived before the rest of our party and they offered to seat us anyway. We opted to go to the bar. We sat at the bar and had a glass of wine and a whiskey while we waited. We ended up ordering the deviled egg appetizer as i had heard it was really good. It was pretty tasty but not the best i have ever had. For a Wednesday night, the bar area had people in it, but not too many. There were two guys playing acoustic guitar songs with great voices. They really added a lot to the experience. In fact, once we were seated, the live music was also playing by speaker in the main dining room! Anyway, the bartender was pretty and very nice. She was polite but not too chatty which was good. 

We were seated immediately once the rest of our party arrived. We were one of 5 or 6 tables seated in the main dining room. The server was good. He made some excellent recommendations about side dishes. we got the jalapeno au gratin potatoes and the corn. Both were delicious!!! I would definitely order them again. I don't really care for spicy food so I was a bit nervous about the potatoes but they were perfect. I ordered the Halibut (which was a little tiny bit dry) but the amazing sauce it came with more than made up for it! My boyfriend ordered the sea bass which was also excellent. Another guest at our table ordered the summer special - a salad, filet or salmon, and any dessert for $35. Considering my meal was $34 for the fish alone, this was a great offer. We finished off the meal with the Alaskan Bake (it was OK) and the peach sorbet (which i loved!). 

All in all, we enjoyed ourselves and would definitely come back here again. Maybe I will try a steak next time!"}
{"text":"When you pay nearly 100$ per guest for a meal that is no better than Red Lobster, then something is wrong.  

The appetizers were good, but you can hardly mess up shrimp cocktail, except that the price was 18$ for four pieces of shrimp.  Stingy!  We shared two appetizers, but it wasn't enough for three people.  The ravioli appetizer was excellent, and I would be raving about it had there been more than four pieces.  It wasn't worth spending money on, especially if you share appetizers.  

Our lobster bisque had three small pieces of lobster, a bland cream sauce, and plenty of corn bread pieces, or whatever it was.  One of my guests hardly ate her soup at all.  My other guest did eat a good deal of his Caesar Salad, however he had to ask for more dressing, and I could certainly tell it lacked an acceptable amount of dressing.

Our main dishes were fairly okay, I really enjoyed my dish, one of my guests really enjoyed his meal (however he did say there was sand in one of his scallops), however the other guest did not like her dish other than the veggies on the side.  In fact she hardly touched her food and packed it up.  

The drinks were very tasty.  The service was attentive, however I thought it was slightly unprofessional the way the menus lingered on the table for so long while it was getting crowed with two appetizers and three drinks plus three waters.  

In the end I wasted my money by coming here.  None of us felt full or satisfied.  We joked afterward that we should have just went to In-n-Out Burgers.  

I would not recommend this establishment at all."}
{"text":"This is the best Seafood restaurant I have ever eaten in. I have to say it is not my kind of place. Very Scottsdale. But Man they know how to cook. I had a Special Shrimp dish of the night that was much better than expected and a very nice portion. The Calamari was 1000 times better than any other I have had. I am not a big fan usually, but this was different. It was not fried but pan cooked and even people that didn't like Seafood tried it and loved it. The Wedge Salad was good. We shared the Mac & Cheese, Mashed Potatoes and Peas. I felt the sides were the only things that could stand some improvement. I had one of the tasty Mojitos and some Yummy Creme Brulee for desert. I am super glad this place is far away because I would want to go all the time. It is a bit pricy, but I felt it was worth it. The servers were really cool. Not uptight at all. The only thing I hated was they have rest room attendants. Maybe it is just me, but come on. I should not have to feel guilty for not tipping someone just for handing me a towel that I could have easily gotten for my self. I have little respect for businesses that do that."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in North Phoenix (High Street). Regulary go for Happy Hour (highly recommended). Great food and drink menu. Upscale and classy. If you like Swordfish possibly the best in the valley. Be sure to ask for Carrie belle if you are in the lounge."}
{"text":"I made reservations here for my boyfriends birthday.  The table was reserved and decorated so  nice it really started the night off in a special way.  We enjoyed fantastic service from our waiter, he was very attentive to our every need.  We started out with some yummy cocktails and appetizers.  We ordered a bottle of wine to go with our delicious meals.  Followed up by super good desert which we shared.  The food and the service combo were fabulous!  It was the  perfect place for our celebration!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went for their happy hour.  We had a wonderful time.  This venue is absolutely beautiful.  Service was not up to par due to only one server being available for the entire bar and lounge area.  However, our server did a commendable job considering the situation she was put in by management.  She was pleasant and professional.  We would love to come back for dinner."}
{"text":"The Ocean Prime restaurant is an upscale establishment with good service. I have been there several times for happy hour with friends. HH is a good deal. Dinner is another story. 
We wanted to treat some friends to a special evening out. We all ordered the scallops, as recommended by the waiter. The salad was OK ...just ordinary. Four scallops for $35 is steep. The scallops were so salty and one still even had a few grains of sand. They were served on the mushiest risotto (with peas) that I have event had. It was obvious that word has gotten out, as there were so few patrons. None of us said anything to each other or the staff. However, with a plethora of fine restaurants in the Valley, I suggest that you dine elsewhere. The owner, wait staff, chef, and management team need to sit down and do some serious re-evaluating."}
{"text":"Scallops were wonderful.  Not overcooked. It is difficult to do scallops well as they can be easily overcooked and it is such a shame to take wonderful ingredients and ruin them. Such is not the case at Ocean Prime.  Sweet and tender.  They had four nice pieces. Service was attentive. The risotto with the dish was also well done.  I had the calamari and ravioli for appetizer which were also very good. I have come here multiple times. Never disappointed. Will continue coming back. Nice wine list also."}
{"text":"So we heard about this place on the Cooking Channel. Specifically the Baked Alaska (which unfortunately we discovered upon arrival was no longer on the menu.) Walter, the manager came over and said that he would see what he could do. The chef said yes and it was AWESOME. 

Emma, our server was bright, cheerful, funny and just the right amount of attentiveness. The prices were reasonable. The atmosphere was great. Even the live music was well above par. We highly recommend."}
{"text":"Wow! That's the best way to begin expressing what a fabulous experience we had at Ocean Prime. We were there to celebrate mine, my sons, and my moms birthday as they are all so close. My other son via New York arranged for us to have a table on the patio by the fire. Beautiful. We were sat right away and immediately we were greeted by our awesome waiter Oscar.  He was the perfect combination of attentive and not overbearing.  I won't carry on for hours but I will say after our amazing dinner, dessert, after dinner scotch, we all agreed this was by far our new favorite fine dining place. We will definitely return soon.  I am excited to try a few more things on the menu as well as their happy hour that sounds awesome.  Again Oscar, thank you to you and all the staff that helped make our birthdays and an evening out such a beautiful experience."}
{"text":"The best Swordfish ever! Giving Legal Seafood a \"wake-up call\""}
{"text":"Nice - very nice. Beautiful decor and an atmosphere that is upscale without being stuffy. The Saturday night I was there, the dining room was full and the bar was doing a brisk business. We had a reservation, and were seated promptly (yay!). Our server was great - attentive but not overwhelming, and very knowledgeable about the menu. The wine list was extensive but not so large as to be an encyclopedia that takes forever to review. After selecting wine, we started out by splitting the house salad - divided between two people it was just enough and a good start to the meal. I had that evening's special - halibut served with mushrooms and asparagus. The fish was prepared perfectly - flaky and moist, and the vegetables and sauce went really well together. My mom had the sea bass, which she loved - ate every bite - hey, I didn't even get a taste!! We also had a side of asparagus with some of the best hollandaise sauce I have ever enjoyed. We were too full to try dessert (darn!) so I just have to go back very soon..."}
{"text":"Weird start but they redeemed themselves. My wife and I had reservations for Saturday night to celebrate a birthday. We arrived to maybe a half full restaurant and were seated in the bar with some awful karaoke. It was definitely not the vibe we were looking for and after ordering our drinks asked to be seated in the dining room. Once we switched tables our experience was immediately better. Our server Thomas was very informative and answered every question we had. We started with the crab cocktail which was delicious. The dipping sauce was wonderful! I ordered the surf and turf and my wife went with the crab cakes. The surf and turf was great and although pricey (and the lobster was more like a large prawn) I would order it again. The crab cakes were huge and my wife was only able to eat 1- which worked out well for me the next morning with crab cake benedict! We had the peanut butter chocolate dessert which was one of the best desserts I've ever had. All in all it was a great night; just don't sit someone with a reservation in the bar as that is weird."}
{"text":"I took my husband here for his birthday & every single thing we had from our drinks to dessert & everything in-between and including the service by the staff was phenominal (never in any experience of dining out can I say this, until now).  We decided to share the wedge salad & I'm glad we did because it was definitely big enough to share between two people.  It was perfect, the lettuce was chilled just right, and that dressing, wow, just wow!  Now, I am from the Midwest & my grandfather was a cattle rancher, so I know good beef & I hold very very high standards when it comes to steak.  Our steaks were absolutely amazing, melt in your mouth tender, cooked to the exact right temp that each of us ordered & seasoned just perfect.  For our sides we ordered the Chophouse Corn & the Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes...oh my gosh, I cannot even put into words how good these sides were, so I'm not even going to try, you just need to trust me.  We also got a little bonus from the manager of Sautéed Mushrooms & Jumbo Asparagus...now, I am not a fan of either of these, however, the asparagus looked so good that I broke down and tried it, oh my Lord, it was beyond delicious (I ate pretty much most of the plate of these bright green stalks of heavenly goodness), Ocean Prime has ruined me for all other places serving asparagus because I'm sure nothing will even come close.  I didn't try the mushrooms, but my husband pretty much ate the entire bowl, and he is still raving about them weeks later!  To cap off our evening, we had the Creme Brûlée, it is by far our all time favorite dessert, so again we hold very high standards...I swear I heard Angels singing when I took my first bite!  Smooth, creamy, and it had the most perfect sugar topping that I got to crack with my spoon.  
I still dream about this dinner, it is one we will never forget."}
{"text":"We had wonderful anniversary dinner at OP last night. They made it even more special by scattering rose petals and buying our dessert. So gracious and warm. The tuna was outstanding, beautifully prepared medium rare. The grouper equally fresh and delicious. The best fish I've had in the Phoenix area. We had a great meal and enjoyed the live music and friendly staff. Thanks OP!"}
{"text":"Met some friends for happy hour on Friday -- my first time to Ocean Prime was a great experience.  The food and drinks were good, along with excellent service -- just the right amount of attentiveness.  The atmosphere was very enjoyable, along with live music.  The pianist & singer provided the right variety of music for the crowd.  I will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Good-but if your going to spend the money...the only game in town is Maestros.  Staff was pleasant and the food was good-would not say great.  I thought a little pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"5 star service, ask for Margaret.
5 star mixologist, Sarah 
5 star chef, Chris on the broiler!

Know for their scallops, nothing short of perfection. The wife enjoyed delectable morsels!

I had French onion soup, lettuce wedge, filet, creamed spinach. 

Worth every penny!

One final word...

Yummmm!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed an amazing meal tonight to celebrate our 5th wedding anniversary! Everyone was so friendly and gracious. Made the night truly special. Also, food was to die for!!! Kyle was super accommodating and helped us with some superb menu choices! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Need to be sure I am fair to the situation.  I actually became quite ill after eating at the restaurant.   I am by no way saying it was the food,  and will not comment on it to be equal to the situation.    The ambiance and staff were exemplary.   The location was ideal to my hotel and the evening was quite good.  

As no one else in the party had the same experience,  I would recommend going  and seeing for yourself."}
{"text":"Great customer service..i ALWAYS get the seabass. Its ALWAYS excellent. I cant get enough of this place.  Excellent wine selection as well..."}
{"text":"I walk into this place and WOW, I'm impressed with the styling. It's swank, sleek and modern. I was there for a corporate meal in one of their private rooms. That room was also very sexy with really cool lighting and a wavy wall design that I liked. 
The food was good. Some appetizer munchies like calamari that was done right, a crab stuffed thingy which was really good, and an icebery wedge with delicious bacon bits and bleu cheese crumbles. I had a steak for an entree. It was perfectly cooked and had very good flavor. My bernaise sauce on the side was also very good. 
Why not 5 stars? The price. Much like Ocean Club and Mastros, this place charges huge prices for what you get. I have no problem plunking down $100/person (not including wine) if I feel that I am getting something truly memorable. (see my review of Posh). 
But the $20/per person premium over what I pay at Eddie V's for the exact same quality food isn't justified. 
Ocean Prime's food and ambiance are superb. So are many other places in this economy competing for my dollars and they cost less. Sorry, but I will stick with Eddie V's, Flemings, Roy's, etc."}
{"text":"Always a great place for a night on the town!  I love sitting in the bar area to people watch and enjoy live music.  The food is delicious and the drinks are perfect.  We love to come for a romantic evening or a fun night with friends.  I love the upscale casual feeling coupled with a high quality menu.  And the service is attentive and prompt and we always leave looking forward to our next evening at Ocean Prime!  We are big fans!"}
{"text":"The dynamite roll on happy hour is great, the mahi tacos and sliders are awesome, so far I haven't found 1 thing that is not amazing. Definitely recommend this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"After visiting different venues for Arizona Restaurant Week, we considered Ocean Prime to be the best.  Their restaurant week menu was generous. We both choose the Signature Salad, sea scallops with Parmesan risotto and carrot cake.  Every course was totally enjoyable. French roast coffee topped the meal and was quite flavor able. Top this all off with excellent service, and these tough graders rate Ocean Prime an A+."}
{"text":"I have had the greatest pleasure enjoying several dinners and awesome happy hours at Ocean Prime. Every experience is met with meticulous attention to detail by a friendly and professional staff. I prefer seafood and the Seabass is off the hook! And if you enjoy a good Mahattan...go see Natalie in the bar...best in Phoenix; hands down."}
{"text":"I took my wife here for her birthday and made a reservation on open table, when we got there the table was set up for us with birthday confetti all over it. The server was very friendly and was knowledgable about the wines they serve. The food was amazing. Scallops cooked to perfection and the lobster tails were flavored just right but not overwhelming. It is pricey but I felt they went above my expectations to make my wife feel special on her birthday."}
{"text":"My husband and I came for a date night. Looked amazing from the menu and the outside of the building. The service was okay, nothing special. We had 5 different wait staff members which was a bit crazy. The food was okay, sounded better on the menu though then in person. Would not go back-nothing special to it."}
{"text":"This place is crazy. It's not my style, but man it's a sh*t show on the weekend, which makes it fun. 

A group of us (4) went their for their chocolate martinis as a dessert after dinner elsewhere. It was really busy. It took us a while to find a table. It took longer to get some service. But, when we did, the martinis were great. 

In the meantime, we watched the crowd. It's a bar scene for all ages, 20s - 70s were here, but I'd say it was dominated by an older (50s? 60s?) single crowd. And there were some crazy acts of desperation there on a Saturday night. Several people making out with each other. One dude was trying to swallow this lady with the way he was kissing her.  There was a live band covering all sorts of things from DNCE to Blurred Lines, to some older 80s and 90s stuff. People were shaking their asses and throwing their hands in the air. The younger women were dressed like they were older women. The older women were dressed like they were younger. The dudes were dressed like Tommy Bahama. 

Ultimately, it was straight out of Orange County, CA, were I grew up. It was, to say the least, very entertaining :)"}
{"text":"Came here on an impromptu evening and sat in the lounge listening to the entertainment.  We had great drinks, appetizers, dinner, dessert, and service.  The atmosphere was relaxed and people were dancing in their seats and singing along with the entertainment.  Ocean Prime did a great job of showing everyone a good time!"}
{"text":"Wife and I are down here for vacation and were looking for a good spot to treat ourselves while the in laws watched the kids.

I had been to one in Atlanta on a business trip last year and had fond memories.

The Phoenix one did not disappoint.  

Atmosphere is hip/swanky.  Food is awesome with a price to reflect it.  I was torn between the sea bass and the scallops. I was very happy with my sea  ass--until I tasted my wife's scallops.  I forgot how good they can be!

So, in sum, this is a great date-night place, but expect to spend about $100 per person once you get a glass of wine or two, an app, salad, etc.

Well worth it!"}
{"text":"Came here for a special event tonight and I was very impressed by the level of service and quality of food!
I ordered a Black Orchid at the bar and it was AMAZING! One of the best martinis I've ever had. 
We went on to have an assortment of appetizers delivered to our table, all of which were great. Calamari, some sort of ravioli and a crab cake.
Then we had a house salad which had a great vinaigrette.  
When the main course came around it was a surf and turf. The sea bass melted in my mouth, it was buttery and just perfect. We also had a 6 oz filet mignon which was cooked perfectly, the quality was impeccable! 
The staff was polished and polite and made everyone at the event feel like a VIP. I definitely felt well taken care of!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here with a few of our friends for a birthday dinner. I had looked ahead at the menu since I tend to be very indecisive and take forever to pick a dish and at the time everything sounded amazing. 

The presentation of the dishes were beautiful however it didn't satify our taste buds. I guess for the price we were expecting everything to taste phenomenal. I just got a simple shrimp pasta dish and my boyfriend got the salmon dish with a side of potatoes (which btw, all their sides are a la carte) and the bill was around $130.  If the food tasted better it would have been no big deal, but for that price I think I'd enjoy myself else where."}
{"text":"Myself and family members went to OceanPrime this location in Phoenix.  The food was excellent!  We ordered steak Oscar style it was beyond delicious.  Also the signature drink bubbles and berries.  The service was very attentive and the food was over the top delicious."}
{"text":"Amazing experience. Nikko did an incredible job making my husband and I feel so special. The service was fantastic, the food was great, the ambiance was romantic and fun and the drinks were delicious. I can't remember the name but we got a shot of this amazing infused liquor they create in house. A great place for your next romantic date night."}
{"text":"Just can not say enough about Tony and the staff at OP.  Never disappoints.  Go enjoy they will make you time there very enjoyable, from the food, to the service the minute you walk in the door you know they are happy you are there."}
{"text":"9/19/11

Came in for Ocean Prime's $40 Restaurant Week deal.  I've never been to OP, but I went in thinking I'd try the seafood.  However, after looking over my very limited choices (two seafood choices, $24 to $27, and steak), and at the suggestion of the server, I ordered the filet mignon ($32) , w/ the first course of side salad.  I arrived at around 15 minutes to 7p, but by the time I was seated by a host, served water, offered food and wine menus, greeted by the bartender, and then met my server, it was just past 7p, and I'd missed happy hour, which ended at 7p.  I was told that I could order happy hour apps at the discounted rate, but not the drinks.  I decided to forgo apps and alcohol and ordered my meal.

I really liked the atmosphere at the lounge area (dinner seating next to the bar), even though it was a little too dark for my liking.  I felt that the room should've been a little smaller to match the intimate setting, but whatever.  Besides two couples, a lone diner, and me, the room was empty.  Outdoor seating looked inviting.  

As I started to relax in this dark space, I decided to try the Strawberry Smash, realizing just minutes before receiving my table check that the drink would not be offered at the happy hour price of $7!  At $12, it was just a tad pricey, but considering the atmosphere, it was not bad.  (Honestly, I was expecting a lot worse!)  I'd definitely come back for happy hour!

I was getting hungry, and it was almost 7:30p, so I asked if complimentary bread was offered (yes!) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tSJTbxhAO1tJMSdeTCiZwg?select=7_-HKOKCU89N1xGIymWorg.  The sourdough roll that appeared seemed a bit too small, but again, whatever.  It had a nice bite, and it came w/ whipped butter.  My cocktail http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tSJTbxhAO1tJMSdeTCiZwg?select=ZJNXrNmhMWUDKJU5PJzC2A was simply delicious!  Just sweet and tart enough for me not to notice the potency of the alcohol within- perfect!  Side salad http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tSJTbxhAO1tJMSdeTCiZwg?select=c0OWt3dKEA311b6sPgy-DA was nicely portioned, and tasted great.  Loved the combo of goat cheese, tiny bits of walnuts, and tart Granny Smith apples.  Had to forgo the mustard vinaigrette due to an allergy, but the sweet house dressing (wine-based w/ \"lots of sugar\") was good, if not a bit too sweet.  A taste of this dressing was enough.  The filet mignon (medium temp.) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tSJTbxhAO1tJMSdeTCiZwg?select=_zUDU5iVZaQWfXp_Im1s5w was tiny, but cooked to perfection!  The roasted garlic was buttery and potent and complemented the potatoes.  However, I would never pay $32 for a 5 oz. steak, with only the roasted garlic on the side!  Never!  Last, I had the creme bruleehttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tSJTbxhAO1tJMSdeTCiZwg?select=WucqsiKbTkzmz7X2huxBxg w/ berries.  I really enjoyed this dessert!  Very creamy and perfect in its texture, and the berries meshed nicely against the vanilla custard.  I'd have liked a bit more berries, so I stole the drunken strawberry from my cocktail and had it with a scoop of the brulee... ahh!!  My one complaint w/ the sweet dish?  The sugar coating was VERY thick!  It had to be about a quarter of an inch thick!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tSJTbxhAO1tJMSdeTCiZwg?select=CMfhGJdpG66djDTo35SNiw http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tSJTbxhAO1tJMSdeTCiZwg?select=Oct9Oo6WCdzZg3hzYHGnGw Most of the brulees I've had had crusts just thick enough to muster a cracking noise when you lightly tap it w/ a spoon.  I definitely had to give this a few wallops.  Not very classy for such a \"dainty\" dessert...

Overall, a nice experience, but certainly not worth the $68 (tip included) I splurged on dinner for one..."}
{"text":"Awesome Rib-eye (melted in my mouth)
Awesome martinis (had the pineapple marinating in the vodka)
Awesome atmosphere (upscale/date night)
Awesome Jalapeno Au-gratin potatoes (get it done)
Awesome service 
Bring a hundo a head, unless you drink more than me....
That's 2 hundo if you have a date
I give it 10 stars if I could (need I say more?)"}
{"text":"..outstanding service, delicious food, beautiful decor. This is a fine dining establishment ! You can actually hold a conversation here."}
{"text":"Came here with a large group of friends for a dinner recently.  Ocean Prime might just be my favorite steakhouse around.

There are good options for appetizers here.  My favorite is the goat cheese ravioli.  They have such a nice tangy flavor from the goat cheese that is really gets the taste buds going.

For entree I will usually get a bone-in filet if it is on the menu.  At Ocean Prime it is a regular item.  Haven't had a bad side dish here but the absolute star in my opinion is the creamed spinach.  They add bacon to it that gives it a wonderful smokiness.  This is a must get for me.

There are two desserts that we have tried the two times I have been here.  The 10 layer carrot cake and the chocolate peanut butter pie.  The chocolate peanut butter pie is just like a reese's peanut butter cup but better.  Only problem is that it is so rich you can't eat the whole thing.  Carrot cake is one of my preferred dessert options too.

This place is absolutely perfect for me.  It has all of my favorite dishes and has great renditions of them!"}
{"text":"I am so in love...of course minus one thing of course.  I will never be fully satisfied it seems.
I went to Ocean Prime for my birthday a couple of weeks ago.  I had a reservation for 5 and the service from the start was awesome.  We were in one of the rooms, so we couldn't hear any of the noise from the bar.  The place is well lit and easy to have a conversation with my friends.
They started us off with a veggie and relish tray, which I have to say I fell in love with the the cream cheese dip that they had.  And their bread was AMAZING!!!  
I ordered the Chop Chop salad which was divine.  My friend Jen had the same thing and just loved it.  We also both ordered a Greyhound (Vodka and Grapefruit) and I loved the fact that the bartender actually squeezed the actual grapefruit.  I now am ruined from any other Greyhound.
My other friends ordered French Onion Soup...that looked so yummy, I wished I ordered it. (They both said it was great)  My one friend also ordered the Ravioli and the other two shared the surf and turf appetizer...all said was wonderful.

The only two setbacks that made me not give this place five stars is when our food was served.  Rayna told the waiter French Onion soup first...but was then given the Raviolis.  And when my friends asked the waiter to bring out a candle for my Carrot Cake...somebody else brought it out for us....minus the candle.  (And for the first time tasting Carrot Cake...not bad!!!)

I will back again though....so I can have some French Onion soup with a Greyhound."}
{"text":"I took my husband here to celebrate his birthday and everything about this place was amazing! The cocktails were delicious and the food was fantastic. We ordered Filet Mignon and it was prepared perfectly! The jalapeño au gratin was my favorite side. It had so much flavor and just the right amount of heat from the jalapeños. Service was great thanks to Savannah and the rest of the staff were very friendly. For dessert try their chocolate peanut butter pie, you won't regret it. Thanks OP for making my husband's birthday dinner special. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Having dinner at this restaurant. Wow. I'm so full, everything was delicious. Most people in my group had Chilean Sea Bass, but others had King Crab legs, the filet, and the Salmon. 

We shared sides - the Brussel sprouts were divine, we also shared corn, mushrooms, tater tots, broccoli and cauliflower. 

It is expensive, but so worth it if you are looking for good seafood and/or steaks."}
{"text":"Took my wife here for dinner on Mother's Day and it was our first time. We were so pleased with every aspect. My wife had the raw oysters for her appetizer and even though they were relatively small, she said the taste was fantastic and she could tell that they were very fresh. I had the Surf N Turf for my appetizer which was amazing! The surf was scallops and the turf was braised short ribs that was removed from the bone and already pulled, much like what you would normally think of as pulled pork. The flavors were spot-on for everything. I enjoyed the scallops so much that I also chose them as my entree. Again, cooked to perfection! My wife had the Halibut, which is one of her favorite fish dishes. It was tender, juicy and flavorful. The spices used were not the ordinary variety that you would expect for halibut, but worked brilliantly. She is already asking when I'm going to take her back! =O)"}
{"text":"Excellent seafood! My kids and I are, in general, frequent diners and love seafood. Staff here is wonderful. Very attentive. Enjoyable place. Great drinks and desserts."}
{"text":"I contacted the owner based on his comment regarding my review and he never contacted me back.  Hmmm..."}
{"text":"I'll start with the experience with the hostess; she seemed very confused and unclear of why we were there. 

The waiter was nice enough, but the service was not up to what I would expect at a steakhouse. 

The filet was subpar; very salty, but edible. The sides were nothing exceptional. 

At the end of our meal we were having some cocktails but the wait staff seemed frustrated that we weren't rushing to leave, even though they were open for another 45-50 minutes. 

I wouldn't make a trip back."}
{"text":"Well this is a first...my two kids had the best meals out of the four of us! The mac and cheese was great as were the corn and carrots but jeez, this place has no business serving fish and seafood! The crab meat cocktail and the sea bass were both nowhere near fresh. Just so bad I wish I had sent them back.  The fillet mignon was perfect and really that is what this place should be...a steak house. Period."}
{"text":"Really good apps (specifically, the calamari and tuna tartar), and the bone-in ribeye was a tasty cut of meat. The food menu was pretty cool, with interesting fish options and a fairly standard American steakhouse selection. Didn't have drinks but my coworkers seemed happy with their wine and cocktails.

Our server was friendly and able to give helpful opinions on our entrees. We went on a Monday night, so it wasn't busy at all, but the ambiance was nice. 

Overall, a good place to go with a group - there's a little of everything for everyone. It's not inexpensive by any means, but if you skip drinks and don't do steak, you can come out fairly unscathed."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend came here before attending the comedy club. This place was very classy and immediately was impressive. I had the best Manhattan I've had and my girlfriend enjoyed an espresso martini. We also tried the crab dip which was phenomenal! There happy hour menu is fantastic, with lots of options if your on a budget while still being able to dine in a high end spot. Fish tacos were huge and sushi roles looked so delicious. Bartenders were very professional and well trained. Also, there was live music with a singer and piano which made the experience even better. I would highly recommend coming to check out. I plan on stopping by to try there full menu at some point."}
{"text":"We come to Ocean Prime expecting a fantastic Platinum experience. However, in reality it was anything but. We arrived around 7pm to a restaurant that was only at about 10% capacity. Our server arrived to the table and was just a bit clunky. I expressed to him that it was my first time, expecting to be told about the menu maybe receive some suggestions. But none of that happened. I ordered a dirty Belvedere martini with blue cheese olives. It arrived about 10 mins later not ice cold and watered down. In my mind I thought ok so I'll just have water for the rest of the night. Our French onion soup comes out, and what's supposed to be a rich broth soup with a a layer of baked Swiss cheese tasted like it was a hybrid of Blue Cheese and Swiss. On to the main course, 8oz filet with Crab cake, and truffle mac and cheese.  The filet I ordered Medium Rare was served Medium at best, the crab cake which the server said only had enough filling to bind it, was dry & crunchy. The sauce on the mac and cheese had broken leaving a cup of crispy noodles that were so hard I could have given it to my dog as a chew toy. The server comes back to the table about 8 minutes later and takes my steak back to have a replacement one prepared, fast forward 10 minutes I have a new steak that is lacking flavor and rare. So much so that the center is cool to the touch. Fast forward 20 mins we get our check and the server says to me, \"we took care of your dessert for messing up the steak\". I found this comical since I didn't order dessert. After its all said and done our bill totaled $166, $200 with tip. All for a subpar experience at a perceived above par restaurant."}
{"text":"Love the ambience of this place! The night we went, there was a guy playing the piano in the bar who was awesome! The recent night we visited we only had a cocktail and happy hour menu, but we have eaten here before and it is divine! We will definitely be doing dinner here again soon! Drinks are super pricey, but that seems to be the norm for this type of restuarant."}
{"text":"The food was delicious.  We had a large group and we were able to sample everything from steak, fish, the pasta dish and a wonderful vegetarian entree.  The side dishes were great and so were the desserts.  We loved the wine recommendations.  Our party of eight all left extremely happy!"}
{"text":"Friday night, we were heading to Blue Martini for the first time and it looked loud and packed, we were looking for some place to talk. Since Ocean Prime was right next door and didn't look quite as busy, we decided to stop in there instead. This place has a very upscale ambiance and I immediately thought it was going to be a pricey night and I was right. We went to the lovely bar to seat and I ordered some sort of berry martini, it had a fruit ice ball in the center and it came with enough for 2 drinks so it was worth the $14 price tag. My boyfriend ordered a dirty martini and that also came with enough for 2. We had the best time at Ocean Prime, there was live music and they were singing some of the old jams. When they started singing \"doin the butt\" I ran on the dance floor and danced my butt off. This is the kind of place where you can leave your purse unattended which I did to go dance. I decided to try something to eat so I ordered the ahi tuna tartare with avocado. It came out and looked so pretty I felt like I shouldn't wat it. But I did. Hahaha It was delicious. It wasn't like tuna tartare I've had in the past though, this kinda tasted like tuna sushi. When our friend arrived we decided to try some wine. We both had a glass of Moscato which was absolutely delicious and sweet, almost like a Reisling. Oh it was VERY tasty and I do recommend it. My boyfriend and I danced the night away there until they were closing up. We will be back."}
{"text":"Had a nice experience with pleasant service.  The place is extremely noisy however, so very difficult to hold a conversation.  The menu is interesting, not your standard seafood/steak house, however, it is somewhat limited and somewhat unusual.  Odd to find bottom dwelling tilapia at a high end restaurant or cheese fondue, for that matter.  HIghlights were the black truffle mac and cheese, sweet potatoes with marshmallow brulee and crab cakes.  Did not find the steak anywhere as good as Mastro's or steak houses of that caliber, it was rather grizzly and tough.  Thank goodness we tasted the green peppercorn sauce prior to ordering, because that was frightful.  Not sure I would rush back, but did enjoy the evening.  Good friends helped!"}
{"text":"The ambiance here is just awesome, you feel so relaxed with fire places and the fresh air flowing through. I came here for a work dinner and was very impressed. We started with some oysters and very large tasty shrimp! 
For dinner I had the teriyaki salmon which was amazing, melted right in your mouth! We also enjoyed the mac and cheese as well the creamed spinach. For dessert we did the AMAZING peanut butter pie as well the fresh pressed coffee!
It was very clean here and I will definitely be back, however I would say the only sad part was the service... not as friendly as I expected."}
{"text":"For a restaurant located in a city so far from the ocean, Ocean Prime offers a very fresh, and very tasty seafood selection.

We started off with the Seafood Tower for an appetizer. The tower comes out spewing a smokey fog out over your table, looks sort of cool if you aren't used to seeing it. Very cool presentation. More importantly, though, is the quality of the food you get in this tower. Oysters, jumbo shrimp cocktail, seared scallops, and cut crab legs line the tower, all fresh as can be. You cant go wrong with any of the options on the tower, but the highlight for me was the scallops. Those had a nice firm exterior, with a soft and moist center, cooked perfectly.

The entree was Chilean Sea Bass, with comes with some vegetables and a creamy, savory sauce. The sauce has a light taste to it, almost a bit buttery, but it doesn't overpower the flavor and texture of the fish. You get a nice big portion that should leave you quite satisfied.

The service was absolutely excellent!

5/5 stars all around"}
{"text":"This restaurant was great! The ambiance is nice, however the reason why I can't give it 5 stars is because the music playing from the blu lounge was too loud. I don't think that helps with the ambiance of the restaurant. The food was great! I had the salmon which was cooked to perfection! Will go back and try again."}
{"text":"In from out of town. Read reviews and decided to give the Ocean Prime a shot. Service was excellent our waiter was very professional informative and helpful with choices. He made a great Wine recommendation along with main entrees and sides. The Lamb Chops were amazing the Mac and Cheese is a must along with the Brussel sprouts. Highly recommend giving this place a shot."}
{"text":"We dined here for our 30 year anniversary, and everyone from the hostess to the busboy wished us happy anniversary. There were rose petals on the table. Server was very accommodating, as you would expect a restaurant with $35 entrees. everything was quite excellent, from the perfectly seared scallops to the steak and shrimp with au gratin potatoes.  they brought us a lovely anniversary creme brulee dessert. I would highly recommend Ocean Prime as a special occasion restaurant."}
{"text":"We are new to the area and Ocean Prime came highly recommended. It's our new favorite place to eat. Service is outstanding, as is everything else about Ocean Prime . The cocktails are creative and fun, the food is amazing! Hands down the BEST crab cakes and carrot cake I have ever had . We look forward to eating our way through the menu while enjoying the live music and outstanding service!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is way overpriced, the portions are small and quite frankly the food is not that good. Being from New York I expect much more from a restaurant that supposedly is rated 4 stars. I would skip this high priced eatery and save yourself time snd money"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Ocean Prime for an anniversary celebration.  We had a reservation but it wasn't necessary on a Wednesday evening.  Upon arriving, we were informed that their Happy Hour was in progress in the bar area and if we wanted to go, they would hold our table.  We decided to try it.  $5 glasses of wine (good wine) and $5 & $8 appetizers (like Ahi Tuna tacos) were delicious.  

After happy hour (which ends at 7:00 pm), we went to our waiting table.  They had spread rose petals on our table to help us celebrate.  Nice touch!  Our waiter and the food were excellent.  The filet mignon was cooked to perfection and was amazing.  It was the best steak I've had in a long time.  When our dessert came, \"Happy Anniversary\" was written in chocolate on our plate.  Great place for great food.  It's a bit on the pricey side, especially the wine, but worth it."}
{"text":"Unquestionably one of the best seafood meals we've ever eaten. The service was impeccable atmosphere exceptional and overall experience a 10+++. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Had a great meal with friends and co-workers.  Had an easy time reserving a table for seven and the service was prompt and the food was enjoyable.  One of the things I like is the openness of the restaurant and the ambiance that is created."}
{"text":"Sadly disappointing.  We've been here many times and the service really lacked this time!  The bar ambience is excellent it should be packed so I cannot help but question why it would not be packed!  Is it the service is it the food is it the cocktails, what?  They had a two piece band which was very good!  The pricing is comparable to Ocean Club but at Ocean Club the service is over-the-top 
impeccable so I'm thinking that maybe people are disappointed to spend that much money and not have the service behind it?  Personally we don't have an issue spending as long as the service is there and the food quality and I suspect this is a mutual feeling with the market.  We'll be back and hope whatever the issues are resolved soon or I fear that the crowd that can spend consistently, won't there."}
{"text":"So, this is a very nice restaurant with a pleasant atmosphere. They have live music and bar tenders in the main bar are amazing. I have always gotten drinks and appetizers and they have always been wonderful, the scallops. Short ribs and chard Brussel Sprouts are perfect.

However, the last time we visited, I ordered their special (I believe it was a 6 oz. Sirloin Steak for +$60) which was supposed to be out of this world, according to our waiter. What I got however was more like 2-3 oz. of a very tough to chew steak, with enough connective tissue to make an entire tennis net.

I'll give them a 3 for now and visit one more time. If the main course disappoints again, I'll drop them to a 2, if not lower."}
{"text":"We frequent this place often. They have a great happy hour and live music.  The service is always good (we loved Leslie but I think she's gone) and Sara is fantastic too! I recommend the sliders, fries, hummus or oysters at happy hour. We have dined there too and all of the steaks and their chicken dish is wonderful. The only thing bad I have ever been served is their broccoli. It was colorless and tasteless and it didn't seem fresh but I'm guessing it was just a fluke as their food has been very consistent. So nice to have a great steak house in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"So my mom had been raving to me for weeks about Ocean Prime's happy hour and when my mom says a restaurant is good, it's really saying something because she can be quite picky. (I love you mom!)

My mom decided for my family to go here for her birthday dinner, perfect excuse to finally try it out! To my surprise (note the sarcasm), she was 100% right. Their happy hour is AWESOME. Not only do they have happy hour from 5-7 (a little later for those that work late!) but they have great prices for being such a nice steakhouse kind of restaurant.

First of all, they give you complimentary popcorn. If you know me, you know I freakin' love popcorn so this was an instant bonus. It's not just any popcorn, its popcorn with truffle oil, butter, and salt on it, making it incredibly addicting. The best part is, you can just keep asking for more popcorn....for FREE. 

Beers are $3, glasses of wine $5, and some specialty cocktails for $6 like sangria or their Moscow mule. I ordered the sangria, which is a red wine sangria, and it was very tasty. If I wasn't driving, I would have ordered a 2nd or 3rd glass.

As a table we decided to split their Kobe beef sliders (2 for $5), the parmesan truffle fries, and the bruschetta. Let's just say there was nothing left on our plates. Everything was delicious and well prepared. My dad and I ended up splitting one more order of the sliders, because...they are $5! Why not?!

My sister let our amazing server, Barbara, know it was our mom's bday at the beginning of the meal and at the end she brought out a complimentary birthday dessert! My mom chose the carrot cake and that thing was impressively layered and tall! Also incredible, I might add. 

The food, service, and atmosphere was wonderful. Barbara rocked, and so did the live music which happens every Friday night! Can't wait to take my boyfriend for a romantic night out!"}
{"text":"I really like the bar here.  It has a nice vibe.  The neon blue lighting really gives it a very relaxing vibe.  They need to turn the other lights down quite a bit though.  I've only been in here for drinks in the bar.  I don't think I can afford dinner at this place.  But I'll come back for a drink or two.  They need to get a real jazz band and not the karaoke guy they have now."}
{"text":"We go to Ocean Prime for good reason....Always a table and always a good steak prepared perfectly to my liking, every time. This is a routine place for us because the atmosphere is ideal (we do the open bar seating which is elegant, yet casual) and we enjoy the live music entertainment. It's a few steps above quirky karaoke bar sound but gives that down to earth feel for the place. Lastly, the most amazing 10 late carrot cake nicely turns off a completely satisfying night."}
{"text":"Went here for my friends birthday and i can say i was not disappointed. The service was great excellent!!!!!!! we were able to bring our own cake to celebrate so we passed on the free dessert. The food was pricey but it was really good. steamed seafood bowls were off the hook. the menu was very simple and not overwhelming."}
{"text":"My wife and I went for my birthday dinner.  The table was reserved and decorated with a funny name plate.  We had a filet and Sea-bass and both were very good.  Our service was very good as well and management stopped by the table to ensure everything was great.
They offered me a free desert for my birthday as well.  It is pricey but has a great atmosphere and live music on the weekends.  We used Opentable to book the reservation."}
{"text":"Halibut (which is only sometimes available because they refuse to buy frozen and serve year round) was absolutely amazing. Cocktails were great, service was great, sides were great. Even something as simple as French Fires were at a whole other level. Highly recommend...."}
{"text":"Wow !   
Food was fantastic.
The food , the service , the live music 
All 5 star
This is a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were celebrating this last Saturday evening and wanted an extravagant meal. We were pleased to have walked out knowing that Ocean Prime delivered just that to us! The food was honestly the best food I've ever had- being from the San Francisco Bay Area, traveling to multiple destinations, and dining on Cruise Ships; that's a huge compliment. The service was very good too, however it did lack attention to re-fills at one point during our experience but once brought to their attention, our drinks were quickly full and remained that way. The atmosphere was very clean, romantic and the room was full of modern touches. We just loved it and walked out very pleased! We will definetly be celebrating there again."}
{"text":"The food was good, but we got a piece of plastic in our potatoes. They were very accommodating, but you just don't expect that to happen at a place like this."}
{"text":"Not impressed with the food here.  Nothing spectacular about this place.  Steak was not prepared to tempature and service is medicore at best....Tried it twice but not super impressed both time."}
{"text":"I had 8 oz filet mignon rare here, when I had the same rare 8 oz filet at Ruth Chris at Indian Bend and Scottsdale Road just the night before, so I can compare the two.  It is remarkable how different the beef tastes at Ocean Prime vs Ruth Chris.  The filet mignon at OP was shockingly \"gamey\", when compared to RC, which is just American beef.  When I had the filet maybe half a year before, it tasted really gamey too.  I do like gamey meats, but in this case, I liked the RC filet taste better.  RC filet seemed more melt-in-your-mouth like butter.  The OP filet had more meat fibers, even though both were rare.  

I liked Ruth Chris sides so much better too.  OP gives mash potatoes on your plate with a small bit of string beans, small bit means like a garnish to the potatoes, rather than a \"side\" size portion.  And I really like RC's creamed spinach.

What I love about OP is their crusty sourdough bread.  I fill my tummy with the bread, can't stop eating it.  I can take the beef home later. 

Also 5 stars for the dinner salad, because the goat cheese and candied chopped nuts really added character and texture to the mixed green salad.

5 stars for the decaf, it was like a dessert, sooooooo fragrant and good.  They had caffeine free tea too, really fragrant and fruity.  I tried to get the name of it but the label did not say.

Service at both restaurants was really good, no complaints, no memory of anything lacking.  Servers were very willing and cordial and got everything I asked for, which was a lot."}
{"text":"Great for Happy Hour! We have been here several times to meet friends for the Happy Hour. The bar is the best place to be with live music and a great Happy Hour menu. The ahi tuna tacos are good as are the sliders and chicken satay and if you like oysters they are very good. This time I went with an appetizer instead of the Happy Hour menu and got the mussels, excellent and a good size portion. Smoking is allowed in the front patio off the bar so if you want to smoke cigars or cigarettes but I'm not sure if you can eat outside since there are no tables just bench seating but our waitress did tell us they they are going to be redesigning the outdoor patio sometime soon."}
{"text":"Ok, right off the bat I'll concede the steaks are quite as good as Mastro's (Ocean Club or City Hall) but they're damn close, and combined with the rest of the menu and the service its a better overall experience.  
The food is GREAT, especially the shrimp with cream sauce (I forget the exact name, but its featured on the menu).  The steaks are well marbled, not overly seasoned and perfectly cooked, and my wife says the fish is terrific as well.  The bar pours real drinks and the waitstaff knows how to serve them.  
My biggest problem with many of the best steak places in town is the vibe they give off that \"you're just lucky to be here\".  Not so at OP, rather it feels like they've been waiting for your party to arrive all night, which sounds cheesy I know.  Definitely a favorite."}
