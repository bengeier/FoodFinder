{"text":"Short version: LOUD--couldn't hear my waiter or fiance! Some dishes really tasty, others need a little work. A++ service.

Long version:

We went on Tuesday night for what we thought would be a romantic and intimate dinner. We walked in and were assaulted by noise. Honestly, I thought I was at a sports bar on Superbowl Sunday. It didn't help that there was a group of 5 boisterous women who seemed to dominate the smallish space.

Anyways, Todd (our waiter) was the man!! He was extremely attentive and courteous without being overbearing. He knew what we needed before we asked for it. Definitely the superstar of the night.

Now the food. Oh the food. I wanted to like it so badly. When I go to restaurants where we are going to dish out $200+ for dinner, I expect to leave feeling euphoric. The amuse-bouche was some sort of corn chowder and gougere (delicious cheesy bread). Really good! Then we got oysters (Blue Point and Kumamoto). Oysters were fresh and served with \"French cocktail sauce\" which I didn't care for since it seemed creamy (possibly mayo based?) and that just doesn't pair with raw in my brain. We also had some escargot which were apparently made with Pernod. I wish I had seen that because I am not fond of anise but they were served in a puff pastry which was pretty neat.

One of my favorite parts of the meal was the date salad. The dates were wrapped in warm serrano ham and the vinaigrette was light and really complimented all the other components of the salad. Main course: I had the duck breast with some sort of orange puree (Todd said it was a orange/corn puree). It was SO BITTER. I thought I was having antibiotics on my duck, which incidentally was more game-y than I prefer. My boo had the bouillabaisse special and he seemed to enjoy it. Overall, a general sense of meh-ness with our main courses instead of euphoria.

I am willing to go back whenever they don't have their $25 special so hopefully it'll be quieter. Some of their other dishes sound great on paper so I am game to try it out as long as Todd the Man is our waiter again!"}
{"text":"Oh, this is something very, very special. Service was flawless and the food was fresh, inventive and deeply satisfying.

Starters: african prawn on risotto, blue-fin tuna tartar
Salad:: Moroccan Dates stuffed with Chevre
Main: Duck a l'Orange, Filet mignon
Dessert: Apple tarte tatin, spiced cake with pear and ice cream

Yea... that's decadent but the portions are sized such that it's all manageable. I watch too many high-end cooking shows and I'm often left asking myself: \"Where could I eat THAT in Charlotte?\" I now have an answer.

Yes, I have been overly critical in my 4-star rating. However, at this level of dining I'm deducting a single star as the steak was more medium than medium rare. I am however looking forward to return again and again until I find the missing fifth star."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to check our Lumiere for a while ever since I'd been subscribed to their mailing list through the Liberty. What finally got us to the door was an e-mail about their Tuesday special - Heirloom tomato bouillabaisse with a glass of white Rhone for $25.

I'd recommend getting a reservation if you plan on going as the restaurant was full on a Tuesday evening by 7:00. The ambiance and décor can be described as hotel-esque. The framed mirrors on the walls, drapes, and tables just scream 4-5 star hotel lobby to me for some reason! The view into the kitchen is great and seeing the chefs inside with toques on really adds a little character to the French theme.

Service was great, each server explained the dishes well and were always quick to inquire about refills for empty wine glasses. If you do come to eat at Lumiere, I hope you're not in a rush. I like that they serve an amuse bouche and then croissant service but get the sneaking suspicion that these snacks are provided to give kitchen some more buffer time (and convinces me to drink more wine). When our bouillabaisse arrived, the tomato sauce was great and the variety of seafood was impressive: scallops, generous lobster claws, fish (halibut?), clams, and mussels.

We'll definitely be back - I'd love to try something off their main menu to see Chef's interpretation of some of the French classics."}
{"text":"3 couples went to an early celebration for our anniversaries tonight. 

We did not know what to expect except this was a french restaurant
I want to say that this is the best restaurant we have eaten in in charlotte. 
We went to paris last year and celebrated our 20th anniversary at a wonderful restaurant and even though we did not have a nine course meal here , the food was just as good
Our server stacy was very professional and patient with all our request.  
Not ever do 6 of us go out and have everyone totally pleased."}
{"text":"Third time here and I just had to write up a review. We had Seth as our server which was one of the reasons it was more memorable than the other two times. We started out with the Hudson Valley foie gras paired with the sauternes on the wine menu. One word DECADENT. I ended up getting the duck a l'orange as my plate principal which was phenomenal . I wasn't going to order a dessert but the apple galette was calling my name. I'm glad I did because it sealed the deal with positioning Lumiere as my favorite restaurant in CLT."}
{"text":"If you are hungry - this is not the place for you.
If you like small bites of food that are nicely arranged - this is the place for you. 
First off - we went the Saturday before New Years with a large group to find they had a prix fixe menu with no prices on it. Warning bells went off (wound up being $80 or 85 a person pre-tax).
Very small portions - the complimentary bread is one half-dollar sized biscuit, the complimentary soup was basically a shot glass amount. 
I ordered beef tartare for appetizer - was highly forgettable.
I ordered wild boar for my entree - this tasted fantastic but I had three tiny pieces each the size of a golf ball at most.
Apple tart for dessert - once again forgettable. 
I also thought the service was not very good for what is a pretty high-end restaurant - limited attentiveness, couldn't really offer a lot of suggestions on the menu. Maybe that was because the waiter knew he was getting 20% that was automatically added to the bill because we had a large group. 
Anyway I will not be going back again."}
{"text":"Excellent meal. We started with the four gras, and moved on the the lamb chop special, and then desert. 

The brioche bread, the complimentary amuse before we began the meal, and everything was so well done. 

We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Just got home from our Restaurant Week dinner. It was one of the best restaurant meals we have had in Charlotte. The amusement was tremendous. And my mushroom bisque with foie gras was perhaps the best soup I have to ever tasted
 My wife was also pleased with her salad with lobster. The entrees we the weakest dish. The modern duck ala Orange was tough, but the sauce was outstanding. The scallops were good, but not memorable. Both desserts were excellent.
Despite being told about food allergies, two dishes were presented which needed to be replated.that was handled immediately, but...
We are looking forward to returning to try the regular menu."}
{"text":"So great!Service was great food was amazing .Had the lamb and it was incredible.I can't wait to go back and try more food !Very nice atmosphere just great all around definitely would recommend to anyone"}
{"text":"Lumiere is definitely in my list of top 10 restaurants in Charlotte. The service, food quality, and ambience are all always on point. I have been for dinner on multiple occasions as well as for Restaurant Week--both being just as delightful as the other with no diminished service or food quality for restaurant week, which we see more often than we would like in other restaurants in the area. 

The foie gras is the best I have had in Charlotte and comparable to my favorite at STK in Manhattan. It is always perfectly seared and cooked until buttery, but never overdone. They also find the perfect pairings for the foie gras, most recently an apple compote with toasted brioche--just divine! Their salads and soups are also always on point, with very well-balanced flavor profiles and the perfect amount of seasoning, no salt and pepper shaker required on the table, as it should be!

As for entrees, Lumiere never disappoints. For a French restaurant with modern plating flare, one may expect to receive miniscule portions that leave you hungry which tends to be typical in this type of venue. At Lumiere, the portions are generous while still maintaining a beautiful aesthetic with plating. Their beef, whether it be braised, grilled, seared or another way, is always packed with flavor and perfectly cooked. The same goes for any meat or poultry we have had there--duck, pork, and chicken alike. Their sides that accompany any dish are possibly the most memorable element of the meal. Whether it is their decadent lobster macaroni and cheese or the beautifully prepared spring vegetable medley with a subtle herbed butter melted atop, there has not been a side we haven't adored. 

The service is impeccable, most recently we were served by Ramsay who embodied everything you look for in a fine-dining server--eloquence, attentiveness, and a terrific sense of humor. He made us feel as though we were the only diners in the room, something that is not achieved easily in a packed house. 

Charlotte has a few French restaurant gems, but Lumiere most definitely shines the brightest and we will continue to return as well as recommend to everyone we know."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely divine!
They started us off with complementary Gruyere popovers and a smoked trout and roasted onion soup.  We knew we were in for a treat.  
In our party of four we ordered many dishes to share:
Appetizers:
Foie gras- best dish
Stuffed oysters
Duck confit

Salads:
Date salad - incredible
Greens with a soft egg- quite the experience when it breaks and you have a creamy dressing. 

Entrees:
Halibut- soft and flaky
Giant scallops- beautiful with Farro
Trout almandine - amazing coating

Dessert:
Traditional Tarte Tatin

The best restaurant in town!"}
{"text":"I will add my 5 stars to the others. Truly one of the best meals and loveliest experiences we have had at a Charlotte restaurant. It was my birthday, and Lumiere really made it special. Starting with the best French 75 I've had (even though it was a new cocktail for them to make) through the amuse bouche of light and fluffy brioche rolls and a tasting of soup, to our salad and entrees of rabbit and duck, to a lovely dessert and coffee service- it was all done to perfection. Service was spectacular. Seasonal, fresh, balanced flavors with a perfect wine pairing. Jeez, I could go on, but I'll end with an urging to GO to Lumiere, particularly if you are celebrating a special event."}
{"text":"I found this place through Yelp when it was a few months opened and have been coming here ever since. It is never a disappointment. Gotta say this is my favorite French restaurant in Charlotte. Always get impeccable service and amazing foods."}
{"text":"Dinner at 8 on a Friday night. Restaurant was busy. A waiter came within 5 minutes but we needed a few minutes longer to look over the wine list, which is printed in a very small font. When the waiter had not returned after 20 minutes, we realized we were truly in a French restaurant. Another waiter finally appeared who was very good. The menu is very imaginative, especially the starters. The slow cooked octopus was excellent. The wine list is also good. Main courses (scallops and sea bass) were beautifully presented and very good. Portion sizes were appropriate but below the average for Charlotte. Bill for 2 glasses of champagne, a nice bottle of wine, 2 staters, 2 main courses, coffee and dessert was about $240 plus tip. So, why not five stars?  Not the missing waiter, since we were in no hurry. It was the noise level!  My phone app registered 90 decibels in a booth!  This level, which is near that for hearing damage, made conversation impossible. If you go to Lumiere, bring earplugs."}
{"text":"A friend and I went there Thursday night for dinner. We had the coq au vin special. The food was excellent, and the price was right. But, the waitress was exceptionally rude which tended to ruin the evening. If you don't like your job, get out of the business. I told the manager about the rude waitress and reminded him that there are many good restaurants in Charlotte. He knew us as we are repeat customers."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful restaurant.  Don't be put off by the strip mall location.   This is one of the best restaurants in all of Charlotte.  Our 3 entrees were all memorable.  Wine list is great.  A little amuse Bouche of a cucumber soup was wonderful.   Service (Spencer) was delightful.  Creme brûlée great and even the coffee was special.  One thing. And we told the waiter this.  For some reason Open Table indicated no availability at the time we wanted.  We called and got in.    But the place was not full and with this quality it should be jammed.  Hopefully they will figure out the Open Table glitch but call before you give up.  You won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"I truly wish I could give Lumiere MORE than five stars!

Lumiere blew me and my guests away.  We dined here for my birthday and the four of us could not stop saying \"Wow\" as every course came out.  The atmosphere, food and service was impeccable.  The attention to detail per plate was something you would expect to see from a highly renowned New York City restaurant.  

Two of my guests were not so sure about French food, but after their appetizers of Foie Gras and Lobster Salad they turned around quickly.  Everything tasted like heaven and I already cannot wait to go back.  We were waited on hand and foot by Ramsey and this was the best birthday dinner I have ever had.

If you get a chance please go and visit Lumiere I promise you will not be disappointed.  Also, do not just got for one course, you must go all the way to dessert!"}
{"text":"Stop in with my son who lives in Lyon fr. Ordered escargot.  Worst I have ever had . Terrible!
Nothing Freanch about it. Unsatisfactory"}
{"text":"It's obvious Matt Pera has a knack for perfection and his acclaimed Lumiere French Kitchen doesn't fall short on anything. From the second we entered the quaint restaurant it was first class. Our server Ramsey didn't miss a beat making us feel like family and his recommendations were right on point. The lobster ap was delicate and perfectly prepared, the snails tender and bursting with flavor while the venison was so flavorful each bite was a celebration of flavors and so tender you could cut it with a spoon. Everything a feast to the eyes and tantalizing on the tongue...these levels and depth of flavors could ONLY be created by a true culinary artist. Whether for a date or business meeting, anniversary or just because...you can't go wrong with Lumiere."}
{"text":"Wow!  So normally when my wife and I want to go out for a special occasion (anniversary), we opt for The Fig Tree.  This year we instead decided to try reently-opened Lumiere French Kitchen (same owners as The Liberty).  We  viewed the menu before going on-line (note the menu on-line was not complete - there were more items available such as a fresh Alaskan salmon special), so we knew it was going to be $$$ (with an appetizer, salad, entree and dessert it ran about $100 per person including drinks).   Although located in a Myers Park strip mall, the intimate, relaxing atmosphere inside made it easy to forget everything except good company, good wine, and incredible food.  The appetizers (poached lobster and blue fin tuna tartar were outstanding as were the salads (my wife had the salad with the chevre stuffed figs - amazing).  The entrees were all amazing (from the Poulet Rouge Roulad - don't think you are wasting your experience by ordering chicken - let the server describe how it's prepared and you will understand how even chicken can be made decadent)  and the pork dish (with black truffles) was delectable.  Just when we thought it couldn't get better, the apple tart tatin with creme anglaise (and fresh made vanilla bean ice cream) arrived - the most enjoyable dessert I've had in quite some time.  

But what really made the night special was the highly professional and attentive service.  A truly memorable dinner well worth the $$$.   We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Unbelievable. If you love and respect authentic French food, you're in for a treat. We had Octopus, the Foie Gras and Dover Sole, which was a menu special. The seared Foie was as good as any I've had in France and the Dover Sole was heaven. I don't know how I could go to any other place for date night!!!"}
{"text":"I cant say enough about this place. My biggest recommendation, eat off the main menu 1st, Chef Tom is spot on with his modern twists on French Cuisine rich, delicious, and well prepared. You can tell his technique is impeccable, I'm not a trained chef but I eat allot, this gent knows what he is doing. 

The most interesting option Lumiere offers is the Tuesday & Thursday specials. Tuesday classic country style French food ($25 or $30 with glass of wine paired with the nightly dish) and Thursdays, they run a Lobster special which is awesome! Roasted Lobster with butter poached claws!!! WHAT! Yeah, amazing. ($30 Paired Glass of Wine).

In regards to service. Waiters are down to earth people you would want to grab a beer with. Brian took care of last night, good dude. All in all you can see the team effort, great service! 

GREAT SPOT!!!"}
{"text":"We went during Queens Feast with a friend just to catch up.  The menu was perfect.  Great choices.  And the food.  Outstanding. The staff first brought over a wonderful soup to get a taste of things to come.  The first course of  Coquilles St. Jacques was wonderful. I had the Chinese-Style Roast Duck Breast - Amazing.  Best Duck meal I have ever tasted.  My friend had Berkshire Pork Chop which had such a lovely flavor. For dessert, we each had something different. I had the Blood Orange Crème Brulee and she had Milk Chocolate Profiteroles - each was wonderful. 

Service was lovely- though they had to \"rush\" us a bit as it was restaurant week- it never felt like it.

 

I would highly recommend Lumiere for any meal out.  The best meal I have had in years!"}
{"text":"Our hostess was polite and our table was ready within 10 minutes of arriving. From the beginning I was torn between the pure beauty of the open kitchen design and how incredibly loud the restaurant was. The decor is clean, chic, utilizes abstract shapes, paintings, and simple French touches throughout. Mix beautiful hard surface decor with a tiny space and what do you get??? Thats right... ITS TOO DAMN LOUD!!!!!!!

We got the Chèvre stuffed Moroccan dates salad featuring Tega Hills farm lettuce, blood orange, hazelnuts, beetroot, and citrus vinaigrette. I'm not sure if it was because the sweet dates played off of the sour vinaigrette with a perfect balance from the bitter greens and earth beet roots, or because I was starving, but I really enjoyed the salad.

We also got the butter poached langoustines with butternut squash risotto and shaved winter truffles. The risotto was rich and paired nicely with the sweet butternut squash, but I found it to be a little more than al dente. The langoustine may have been good, unfortunately there was only one tiny piece mixed in with the risotto and I missed it.

For our entrees we went with the pot-roast loin chop of wild boar braised belly, choucroute of cabbage and gratin of truffled macaroni. The pot-roast loin chops were cooked perfectly (but should have been warmer) and seasoned pretty well. The choucroute of cabbage tasted weak and quickly got lost under the loin chops. The gratin of truffled macaroni really needed to lay off the truffle crutch and mix in more cheese. As for the braised wild boar belly, HOLY SHIT that was delicious. Tender, crispy, savory, sweet, and definitely a little sinful... the braised belly was the best thing I ate for the night. The braised belly only got better when it was coupled with the (lack of cheesy) truffled macaroni in one single last bite.

We also got the organic lamb chops with braised lamb shanks and roasted Jerusalem artichokes. This is where the night got a little better. The lamb was cooked perfectly and I really enjoyed having the two different cooking techniques. The accompaniment were good but overall pretty forgettable.

For dessert we opted for the tarte tatin with Crème anglaise and vanilla ice cream and then the vanilla bean crème brûlée with macerated strawberries and assorted mini pastries. Both desserts were delicious but neither of them lived up to the hype we had built up in our minds.

Lumiere wants to live up to the memory of La Bibliotheque and Patou but they've got some kinks to work out. They have an incredible concept with a great menu and we really hope they grow into a very successful restaurant with many years ahead of them."}
{"text":"Fabulous dinner. We had the 3 course Tasting Menu which was wonderful & a culinary bargain at $45.00. Service was excellent & great atmosphere. An incredible addition to the Charlotte Food Scene! Our dinner was so delicious & presented beautifully. Lots of little extras too. We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came out to Lumiere for Restaurant Week and were excited to check out this place for the first time. The food absolutely didn't disappoint!!!

We had a 9:00 reservation but didnt get seated till about 9:20. 

Really enjoyed the amuse-bouche! The soup totally warmed me up. We decided to get a bottle of wine that was on special for restaurant week. Great price point and very delish. 

For appetizers, my hubby got the hearts of palm with lobster and I got the escargot. The lobster on his dish was perfection. However, I didnt particularly enjoy the rest. The escargot was perfectly cooked. It was nice to have escargot that isn't swimming in butter, like it is typically served. 

For mains, my husband got the swordfish and I got the Fillet of Grass Fed Beef and Slow-Braised Beef Short Rib. Both of these were delicious. The swordfish was so buttery. The filet was cooked perfectly and the flavors in the short rib were amazing. 

Lastly for dessert, my husband got the flourless chocolate torte that was on special and I got the profiteroles. The profiteroles were like little mini cream puffs of goodiness. However, the winner was the chocolate torte. I am not that much of a chocolate girl and fell in love with this dessert. 

Quite honestly, this meal was so good that I think we could have ordered anything off the menu and it would have been perfect!

The only real big miss for me of the night was the bartender. We ordered drinks while we were waiting for the table. He managed to mess up 2 classic cocktails. I heard my husbands gasp when he put club soda in his Rua Old Fashion. Might have just been an off night.

Absolutely amazing meal and evening!"}
{"text":"From the foie gras to the wild boar this restaurant does not disappoint.  Loved the lamb and the pork belly.....excellent service. Love you Todd."}
{"text":"I spent forever trying to figure out where I wanted to dine for one of my last meals in Charlotte after traveling down on business for the last 1.5 years.  After throwing out many options, we finally chose Lumiere the menu was very intriguing.  I suppose I had very high expectations for Lumiere given the rave Yelp reviews and the solid menu, but after trying a few things I've decided it was good, but doesn't quite go down in my book of Charlotte restaurants as being a \"must try\".

The seating here was very comfortable; we were given a huge booth for two people.  It was pretty quiet on a Tuesday evening, but the atmosphere was still uppity enough for it not to be too quiet.  Our waiter was very friendly and helpful - liked him a lot!

We were presented with a guyere-filled bread and a cute baby cup of delicious butternut squash soup as an amuse bouche - great start to the meal. 

We started off with a few small plates - the local half dozen oysters were good, but probably not the best I've had.  I guess I'm just used to having my oysters with the usual condiments, which they sadly did not have (though I'm told good oysters don't need condiments - I'm just a sucker for routine).  The escargot was okay - the breading was a little overpowering with butter taste and I was kind of expecting the usual escargot presentation with garlickly oil to soak my bread in.  Still decent, though.  The FOIE GRAS was where it was at.  This was 100% the best dish of the night.  They gave us a healthy, healthy serving of nicely cooked foie gras with a delicious cooked date on the side.  I was pleasantly surprised at how good this was.

As for entrees, we got the duck l'orange and the sea scallops.  The sea scallops were a bit salty but nicely cooked.  I wasn't quite a fan of the risotto.  I also noticed that the scallops dish was very, very hot.  All of it basically burned my tongue which was a bit weird... never really had that happen before.  The duck, in my opinion, was my second favorite dish.  It was cooked to a nice medium temperature and wasn't too salty and the sweet orange sauce complemented the saltiness very well.

The value is pretty decent - given all the dishes (all relatively large portions) we ordered plus a couple glasses of wine, we were surprised to see our bill was much more affordable than we thought.

Lumiere is worth a try for some decent French food, but I would stick with definitely ordering the foie gras and the duck here."}
{"text":"Consistently the finest quality of food in Charlotte. The Mothers Day menu selection was exceptional as was the professional service.
Tuna Nicose, duck l'orange, and baba au Rhum perfectly prepared. Lumiere est un cadeau spécial à la ville!"}
{"text":"It just wasn't amazing.  We were here for Valentine's Day so there was a limited menu.  The Duck L'orange was flavorful and very tender but I was a bit disappointed by the lack of crispness to the skin.  Also aside from a few orange slices it was really just duck.  No vegetables for me since I had chose to forego the \"salade\" course because nothing interested me.  A bit too much heart of palm on the \"lobster\" appetizer.  The Napoleon and brûlée were definitely acceptable.  Great service and a decent atmosphere.  Pretty sure they could stand to take one or two tables out of the middle row.  Just seemed a bit uninspired."}
{"text":"Very much enjoyed the dining experience that we had here at this French restaurant. Ingredients are fresh, well-prepared, and high-quality.  Flavors are rich, balanced (not too heavy), and decadent, if you appreciate classical and artful impressions. Ambience is intimate and modern. This is an all time Charlotte fav."}
{"text":"Delicious food! I'd say even better than Barrington's, which is another notable French dining restaurant in Charlotte. Lumiere changes their menu every so often, which I think helps from keeping things repetitive. Also shows that the chef knows what he or she is doing! 

We ordered the scallops, sea bass, chicken, tuna tartar and two types of oysters. they also served a complimentary lobster bisque with a cheese puff. Delicious!! For dessert, we had the chocolate torte and roasted peach. My favorites were the oysters, sea bass and chocolate torte. 

Our waiter was kind and friendly, definitely a great place for special occasions!"}
{"text":"The food and service was out of this world!!! Exceeded my expectations."}
{"text":"This is the definition of fine dining. Our waitress, Deanna was superb! Food was delicious! Manager even came out to ask if we need anything else. Will def come back!"}
{"text":"I went here one weekend in Nov. 2015 and everything was great. Ramsey was our waiter and he was great and gave us some tips. I ordered the scallops and The chef also allowed me to substitute my Brussels sprouts for green beans, which a lot of times chefs do not allow at nice restaurants. I also ordered a few French martinis and they tasted great. The dining room was not too busy and the noise level and lighting were perfect."}
{"text":"Lumiere was the first ~classy~ place I had been to since moving to Charlotte. My girlfriend and I spent a while looking around at places for her birthday dinner and after deliberation, we settled on Lumiere!

It took us a couple minutes to find Lumiere because it was part of a strip mall which was kind of weird for a fancier restaurant. We uber'd there but it looked like there was plenty of lot parking if you're planning on driving.

Walking in to the restaurant, you definitely forget you just walked out of a strip mall parking lot and walked into a legit French restaurant. The ambiance was very French and bright. They had the dining room separated from the kitchen by a large glass wall so we could see the chefs and cooks working in the background. Always a fan of that! *Side note - they were all wearing chefs hats.

We were sat and given our menus and a rundown of what we could expect from some of the options. Our server helped us pick some champagne to start us off and then a bottle of wine for the meal.

We were started off with the BEST bread that tasted like a more dense croissant and we got an order of the gougeres, which were little pastries with melted gruyere cheese on the inside. Excellent way to start off the meal if you're are a bread and cheese fan.

My girlfriend and I both opted for the Chef's tasting menu that included 4 courses, one from three categories and then a dessert for $65 which is a great deal considering the choices you can make. 

My four choices:
1) Started off with the Spanish octopus - I'd give it a 4 out of 5. The octopus was charred in some spots really well and it was delicious, but I wasn't a huge fan of the olives and blood orange that accompanied it.
2) My personal favorite of the night - 5 out of 5. Burgundy Escargot with puff pastry. My Lord. It was rich AF, but I would do it ever time.
3) Gnocchi with butternut squash, parmesan, and brown butter. I'd give this a 4 out of 5 as well. The gnocchi was SO SOFT, and it went with the butternut squash perfectly. Really nice combination. The only detriment was the brown butter seemed to get a little \"oily.\" Other than that, delicious.
4) Salted butter apple galette - 3 out of 5. This was just \"OK\" for me. There wasn't much crunch to it and it tasted pretty middle of the road. 

Overall, this place was great and I would 100% recommend it for a special occasion of if you want a fancy meal for the night. The staff was great and the food and wine are what you would expect from a nice French restaurant."}
{"text":"Spent my birthday dinner at Lumiere and I can say it was a wise choice. It was a Sunday night during Restaurant week, slots went quick. My friends and I decided to take an early dinner. The servers were very at tentative and the dishes were served quickly since it was not very crowded. 
All the courses were very well cooked, seasoned and plated - they served traditional French dishes with twists. The highlights of the night were the Shrimp Bouillabaisse and Duck Breast - they are both Lumiere's signature and didn't disappoint! Portion wise, the dedicated dishes were actually quite filling! After the appetizer and three courses, we were all full but not overwhelmed. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and it was during Restaurant Week. We had to wait 20 mins for our table to open up even though we had a 9:00 pm reservation, but what can you expect during restaurant week. My boyfriend and I both had different things and they were all great! My boyfriend had the Coquilles St. Jacques (Scallops) and I had the Escargot Bourguignon. Both were cooked well, classic for what you would expect. Presentation of all food was beautiful. Our mains were the Gulf Coast Swordfish \"Au Poivre\" and Fillet of Grass Fed Beef and Slow-Braised Beef Short Rib. The beef was melt in your mouth tender. Dessert was the Bread Pudding and the Milk Chocolate Profiteroles. Both were great but the Profiteroles were especially yummy. Overall service was excellent, environment was noisy but with an ambiance. I will definitely be back to give it another try soon!"}
{"text":"First visit during restaurant week....wow! Taste, texture and presentation. You must try the watermelon salad. Every course was superb.  Excellent service and friendly staff. Lumerie definitely found a spot at the top of my restaurant list."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. Came here to celebrate a special occasion and went away satisfied.  She had the golden tomato gazpacho and sea scallops; both excellent. I the farmer's market salad (beautiful, decent, but very small portion) and duck breast (good-fair). Also had the mille feuille potatoes which were interesting but a little overpriced. For dessert we had a tasty apple galette. Service was excellent. Ambience was really nice as well. Worthy of your special occasion!"}
{"text":"What a lovely restaurant, once you have stepped inside. We were very warmly greeted and sat at our table immediately, we wee right on time. 7pm reservation. I would have given 4.5 star if possible. They lost the half star due to the noise level that seems to be  a part of a dining experience. 
Our server was friendly and attentive. The amuse bouche was a very piping hot demitasse of a puréed version of French onion soup. It was quite delicious. It was accompanied by a couple of gougeres. Slightly undercooked, but tasty. E started with the Bourgogne. Succulent escargots and baby button mushrooms in a puff pastry. Followed by the braised pork belly with braised greens, fried quail egg and the most delicious smoked broth. Our main courses arrive s with just the right amount of pause. We noticed the the chef working the pass was watching the tables to make sure food want getting out too soon. It seems so anyway. It was perfectly orchestrated. As the courses were served I noticed, at not only our table but others, that the ladies were served first and from the left ever time. That was very refreshing. Not all fine dining restaurants seem to remember this. Our mains were both equally delightful. The only small carp I had was with the sea bass dish.  It was presented Provincial, the olives were over powering the other flavors. Dessert was a flourless chocolate torte with raspberries, toasted marshmallow fluff and hazelnut ice cream. Yum. At the end of that very favorable indulgence our serve brought us one more offering. A small Chinese Togo box with macaroons. Lovely."}
{"text":"Oh my delish!

Adrift a dream of savory, yummy goodness I found Lumiere in all its wonderful glory... Except it was reality, and everything was perfection. 

From the sweet, welcoming hospitality at the door, to our beloved waiter, James, I felt at home in a classy, yet simple environment filled with joy. I didn't think it was possible to find a restaurant that could compete with my #1 favorite in Charlotte, but dreams absolutely come true for those who wait. A pinch of drama for you there, but Lumiere was sincerely everything I hoped it could be and more. 

James recommended every single dish that we ate and I do not have a single complaint about anything! For example, we wanted a Malbec, but were still debating. James, of course, brings the bottle to our table, informing us that it is the last bottle and wants to ensure that we would get it if we want it. How adorable! For the appetizers, we went with the foie gras, quail on toast and oysters (per James' recommendations). Savory complements of sweet meets salty meets everything yielded awesomeness. Entrees were a sous vide duck and a steak/short rib that were cooked to tender perfection. We finished up Dessert with a rhum cake, which James literally poured fire over, and a divine creme brulee coupled with a delicious ice cream scoop. 

For my birthday, I wish James and Lumiere's main chef to be within my touching distance at all times. That is all. Yes to Lumiere, yes to flamingo desserts and yes to all that makes Lumiere what it is!"}
{"text":"The wife and I have been wanting to try Lumiere for some time now. They probably have been open for 6 months or so. I don't know why, but I was anticipating a bigger restaurant. In fact, it's quite a compact dining room with a small, glass enclosed kitchen. The wife was facing the kitchen, so I really didn't have a view of the chefs working. 

Seeing as none of the cocktails caught our eye, we opted for a reasonably priced bottle of wine from their extensive list. A Pouilly Fuisse, if I am not mistaken, which was crisps and refreshing. We both agreed on appetizers, as we were both in the mood for mushroom risotto. The risotto came with soft cooked egg yolk and truffle shavings. Need I say more in regards to decadence. But first, our server brought us out some amuse bouche of lobster bisque and some cheese popovers to share. Seeing as the wife is allergic to lobster, I quickly confiscated her bisque. Our server noticed my not so slight of hand and inquires about any other allergies. He returns almost immediately with a second amuse bouche for the wife containing a small preparation of beets. She enjoyed the beets, I my double lobster bisque. Soon after, our mushroom risottos arrive and they are every bit the decadence we were anticipating. There were some amazing flavors on display and my only knock is that I wanted more mushrooms, but that is a common complaint of mine. You can never have too many shrooms.

For mains, the wife got the fish special and I opted for the pork chop. I can't remember the last time that I had such a great piece of pork. The flavor was great and it was cooked perfectly juicy and medium as our server recommended. On to the wife's fish special, which was a white fish and assorted shellfish/mollusks en papillote. The presentation was only surpassed by the flavors from the seafood in a delicate sauce. Her dish also came with a boatload of large trumpet royale mushrooms. She was kind enough to share some of them with me, but the seafood she kept to herself. 

For dessert, we shared the apple tarte tatin, and it wound up being the perfect amount of sweetness to share at the end of a great meal. The wife and I highly recommend Lumiere for great service and great food whether it's a special occasion or not. It will set you back a few dollars, but it's in the same money league as the other fancier restaurants in town."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte. I came here with friends for Queens Feast and it was fantastic as always. The food was stellar, amazing service, and great cocktails and wine. I had the Sea Scallops, Duck La' Orange and the Warm Apple Galette. I also added their Fois Gras supplement for $18 but you only live once. I've never had it before so I had to finally try it this time. Everyone at the table raved about their dishes so you really couldn't go wrong with anything. If you decide to come for Restaurant Week in the future, book it weeks in advance. It's no longer the hidden gem it used to be bc they book up early now but it's completely worth it."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in an unexpected location. 

You wouldn't really think to look for great French food in this strip mall location behind a Harris Teeter, but that's exactly what you will find here. The staff is great too and they have a good selection of french wines as well. 

I was looking forward to the bouillabaisse but they didn't have it the night i was there, so i had the Lobster and angel hair pasta.. it was amazing. 

I loved the cheese board with the honeycomb and pears, so yummy and the mussels were amazing. 

I will be back. Also try the french press and the macaroons for dessert."}
{"text":"They have the most professional service in Charlotte and their food equals or exceeds the finest restaurants in Charlotte. The staff is able to suggest perfect pairings of wine with your entrees. They serve french press coffee that is excellent. Nothing more to say except; there is a new sheriff in town and it's called Lumiere. Take your special person here and they will  know they are treasured by you.
3/8/15 They recently added a Tuesday classic French special: for $25 dollars you get a glass of wine and the special entree. There is not a better deal in Charlotte. I have tried it three times and I would be there every week but my bathroom scale vetoed it.
6/8/15 Last week I tried their wine tasting and it is a great deal at $15. You had a selection of four French wines, two white and two red all from Burgundy, plus they served the best  prosciutto I have had in Charlotte. Over the past year I have eaten there quite a bit and I never had anything but a wonderful meal. I would suggest to those reviewers that did not have an A+ experience that they give it another try. As to the price, this level of food in NYC would easily be triple the price; we are lucky to get such value in Charlotte
12/2016 Though their staff has greatly changed they are still an excellent place to go for dinner. all my superlatives still stand. It is a favorite. Do not overlook Aix en Provence on Providence Rd. it is my new favorite place and has many of the old staff of Lumiere. Both are excellent and Aix serves lunch and has Pat to greet you and Laura to serve a fine meal. 
When the mood calls for fine food these are two of my four top places."}
{"text":"We were super excited to try Lumiere during restaurant week this year.  I mean no injustice with a 3 star (A-OK) rating, but that's how we left.  Both of us said it was good, but given the chance we'd go elsewhere in the future.  My biggest turn off of the night was our service.  It was rushed and apathetic.  Never asked what we wanted to drink so I had to order finally ask for my wife and I.  Never offered recommendations and asking questions was like prying info from an interrogation.  Never once asked how the food was as it come out course by course. But the worst of all in my opinion, was that before we had even lifted our spoons for dessert, he had already brought the ticket to the table.  Didn't as if we wanted coffee or drinks (which we did).  We had 6p reservations and got there a little early and was seated about 5:50p.  We were out the door an hour later.  Maybe $100 isn't much to this establishment, but for us restaurant week is really special.  Out of the last 4 or 5 times I done restaurant week, this was our most underwhelming experience.

About the food--it was good. Small, but good.  The lobster in the first course is the size of your finger and the snails are about 6.  In the main, the filet is probably 3 oz and short rib 2 oz.  Desserts were nice size.  

We had...
Fresh Hearts of Palm - with Butter Poached Lobster, Haricot Verts, Shiitakes, Snipped Chives, Creamy Walnut-Oil Dressing
Escargot Bourguignon - Braised Tender Burgundy Snails with Mushrooms, Garlic, Lemon and Herb Butter
Fillet of Grass Fed Beef and Slow-Braised Beef Short Rib - with French Trumpets, Lentils, Quinoa, Parsley Root Cream and Jus De Viande
Salted-Butter Apple Galette - with Caramel-Hazelnut Ice Cream, Frangipane, Cinnamon Crumble, Caramel Gel
Blood Orange Crème Brulee - with Shortbread Cookie Crumble and French Vanilla Ice Cream

Main was definately the best in my book.  Wife loved the creme brulee...apple tart not special to me. The crust was really really hard.

If I were super wealthy and wanted to impress someone who has never had French food, Lumiere has the novelty aspect nailed with plating and little upscale details like coat check.  I just can't get over our service being so lackluster and off putting."}
{"text":"Dined here for the first time for the Taste of Charlotte preview night. Everything was wonderful and the service was great. A very professional restaurant from the kitchen, to Chef Tom expediting, to the excellent staff. There was an optional add-on to the taste of Charlotte menu, the foie gras. It was absolutely wonderful. Well worth the added cost to the set menu."}
{"text":"Holy French Food! This place is off the Rocker!!  We had the oyster salad and the lobster appetizers, the duck and the bass entrees and then the rum balls and the creme brulee for our desserts. Was off the charts good! Also, the French martini was a hit with us. This place is the real deal!! 

The service was also top-notch. We were made to feel very welcome. Especially with my lovely tipsy wife spewing the profane and loudly talking about other people in the restaurant. I was grateful to have been allowed to even see my entree, much less finish my meal. They deserve 10 stars!"}
{"text":"It has been a long, cold, dark and dreary winter. In light of this, we decided to start off spring with a special date night and selected one of Charlotte's newest and most buzzed about restaurants for dinner.

The buzz did not mislead. Lumiere French Kitchen was excellent!

First, a few notes about the interior. From the clean modern lines, evocative of mid century classic design to the natural textures with a palette of gentle beach glass tones everything in the interior was flawless. We were particularly fond of the lighting and the light level was PERFECT! So pleasant to actually be able to read a menu without having to use the flashlight feature on my iPhone for a change.

Lumiere had a small, but very well curated wine list - some of the standard French pedigrees and a few surprises. I enjoyed a glass of a lovely and crisp Sauvignon Blanc from Hexagonals (https://winelibrary.com/reviewwine.asp?item=47246). It was a perfect start to the meal I had selected.

Dinner started with one of the most delightful little rolls I've ever had - light and fluffy and dripping with the flavor of gruyere. I believe I might have propositioned the baker, but I was strongly under the influence of the delicious bread at the time and refuse to be held accountable for my wanton ways.

We were then given an amuse buche - Dave received a beautiful bite of the Parisian Gnocchi while I enjoyed a soupcon of Lobster Bisque. The presentation, not just for the Amuse Buche, throughout the meal was lovely - simple, modern and clean lines on white service with contemporary, slightly edgy shape to it. The Gnocchi were light and delicious, nearly translucent in their delicacy. The bisque was earthy and a little lusty with the taste of the sea from the lobster blending beautifully in the creamy base.

For the next course, Dave enjoyed a salad of Cheese Stuffed Dates, Beet and Frisee - composed layer by layer and finished beautifully with a delicate vinagrette and a tiny pinch of sea salt. I dove into a tureen of the Artichoke Bisque with Foie Gras Torchon (yeah, I've heard all about the horrors of Foie Gras, but two or three times a year I'm willing to pretend ignorance because it's just that friggen good). Often bisques are gloopy or too salty. Not so here. Lumiere's was near perfection in texture, temperature and flavor. Again, there was an earthiness to it's composition that tempted me to forget about my main and just ask for another bowl of bisque.

Main courses did come, however, and there were no regrets there either. The chef prepared a gorgeous vegetable plate for Dave (off menu due to his vegetarian needs). The colors, textures and flavors were all beautifully balanced. I had the Butter Poached Lobster, which is listed as a starter but served me well as a main, especially after the richness of the bisque. The lobster was cooked perfectly - still tender and delicious. It was served on a bed of shaved hearts of palm, haricots vert, trumpet mushrooms and tiny bits of crisp pancetta. Supurb!

As finale, we shared a dessert of Poached Pear in Red Wine with a black peppercorn sauce served on a blueberry financier cake with a dollop of vanilla rum ice cream. That was then followed with two perfect little house made macaron cookies.

The meal left us very satisfied, the flavors were very well balanced and unlike many classical French meals, we didn't feel over stuffed and over sauced afterwards. The pallette was clean and fresh, presentation beautiful and the service attentive and discreet.

I think the last time I've had a meal to compare, I was actually in Paris or perhaps at the venerable Cyrus in Healdsburg.

Congratulations to all involved at Lumiere French Kitchen! Exquisite Exeuction of concept and a fantastic meal."}
{"text":"Good spot with friendly service, food is classic French fare and consistently good. The location is unassuming as it's in a strip mall, but is a classic and romantic setting once inside. Not crowded during the week and thus good for a quiet meal and easy to get a reservation. 

Small nits: wish the server had suggestions on which dishes were actually favorites (other than the most expensive items)."}
{"text":"I came here with a group if fellow Yelp Elites for restaurant week and had a great dining experience. It was such a great deal, they offered four courses instead of the usual 3 at other places. Our first course was a tiny cup of the corn bisque and it was accompanied by a gruyere cheese roll. Oh my it was so delicious. I could have had an entire bowl of the corn bisque and more of those rolls. The second course we had our choice of appetizer. I chose the bouillabaisse. It was great and the bouillabaisse was absolutely fabulous and refreshing. It was so goos, I wanted to turn the bowl up and drink it but I restrained myself. The third course was the main entree and we could choose from a few on the list. I chose the pork belly. It was good. The final course was dessert. I had the apple tart served with ice cream. It was quite delicious and I couldn't finish it all. Overall we had a great dining experience and the staff were very attentive and nice. I will be back to try other things on the menu and of course fr more of that delicious corn bisque."}
{"text":"Au revour, Lumiere.  Such a sad ending to a wonderful place.  Try and come back, please!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place 10 stars I would.. Their customer service was beyond exceptional. Todd (waiter) from Charleston SC was very knowledgeable with all the dishes. He assist us every step of the way. Recommend on his likings and what's good on the menu.. I wanted the 4 course nightly tasting menu for $55. I wanted everything so the tasting menu appeals to me a lot. 
So I'm thinking for $55. You get 4 courses but a small portions. I was COMPLETELY WRONG.. We started with the spinach/leek soup in the cutest espresso cup. Todd said this will clean our pallet! Which is soo yum.  See pic.. 
Starter: baked oysters (see pic) 4 huge oysters. Yum.. Nicely baked. Not over cooked, and the oysters tasted just right. Not tough. 
Salad: I had some kind of salad with bacon. Just great presentation. But the bacon was a little too salty for me. I'm guessing it suppose to balance out once you eat the salad with it. The candied walnut was awesome!! 
Dinner: I have ONE of the scallops. The food was starting to come up because each course was full size. I'm so full! The scallop like the oysters was nicely done.. Not overdone. Presentation was beautiful. Everything paired together gorgeously. 
Dessert: omg omg omg.. This is my favorite. I had a little bit of the molten chocolate cake..(see pic) sooo good. And my dessert is the pear Creme brûlée. Which is my favorite dessert in general. The cream was a little softer than I would like. But it was the 1st time I had a creme brûlée with pears. It was delicious. The pears was soooo good. 
And top of the night.. We received complimentary macaroons. (See pic) I have a little bit of the lemon, raspberry and latte for the 1ST time.  I'm in heaven. Again.. I can't really say anything bad about this place. They showed us what customer service should be.. The presentations of the food made you want to just enjoy before digging in. Todd and Ramsy are the cutest, sweetest waiters I have ever encountered. I'll be back and I have forwarded 5 ppl the details of this place.."}
{"text":"Terrible experience here. Food was bland and unexciting, the pork Chops were served to us raw, unsafe to eat raw. The French onion soup was bland and the bread tasted gluten free, it tasted like cafeteria soup. I could not finish it. The meal totaled over $400 and we all left hungry and disappointed. I honestly expected to have some of our meals comped because it was so bad. 

This was the second time there for my fiancé and I and the first for my parents. Our first time at lumiere was also not thrilling so this has sealed the deal on lumiere for us. 

If you're looking for a better French restaurant in town - good news: there is an AMAZING one down the street. Take your money and time to Aix en Provence where you will certainly be wowed and treated like family/royalty."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this experience at Lumiere for restaurant week! We were seated at our table at the time of our reservation and greeted by our waiter to take our drinks. We ordered a bottle of wine and were brought the amuse-bouche of warm vichyssoise and gougeres, which really warmed the soul. I could have had a whole meal of that soup and about a dozen of those little puffs of cheese bread!! But like the waiter said, \"we'll do better than that\", and they did! I ordered the carnarolin risotto which was gulf shrimp and mushrooms, the salmon and cheese plate for the dessert course. Everything was perfectly timed and perfectly cooked. I don't normally order salmon because I usually like it on the undercooked side which often is not done correctly. This salmon was perfect! It was done sous-vide and could not have tasted any better with the creamed spinach and sauce. The wait staff was well informed and did their job to perfection. I went into this evening with no expectations and was very impressed."}
{"text":"So we came here for a friends birthday. I would like to think of myself as a foodie but the truth is my tastes just don't quite reach that level of out of the box eating (for an American). I will say this is a great restaurant though. I was not overly fond of the menu, but the food I ate was really good. I started out with an endive salad that had a cave aged thomme dressing on it and had prosciutto, candied walnuts, etc. I liked it a lot. Then I had the Texas Wild boar Chops which came with lobster mac and cheese and pork belly topped with roasted pear. I'm not a big lobster person but overall the mac and cheese was really good. The chops were cooked to my specifications and were tender and the pork belly was a nice touch as well. They brought us out a starter of lobster bisque and a cheese biscuit in the cutest teeny tiny mugs. They also brought out a brioche bun. The food is pretty classy I have to say and the glass of wine I had was nothing short of perfection. So if you are into French food and foi gras, and sweet breads and that kind of thing definitely check them out. I probably won't be back just because it's not my thing, but my friend said it's his favorite restaurant that he's tried recently. Oh side note it's pricey but I think anyone reading this probably knows to expect that and the service and staff here are absolutely some of the best I have experienced. No snobby people here!!"}
{"text":"4.5 Star Rating, Rounded UP to 5.

First time here, and we were greeted by Patrick, a native of Lyon, France. I attempted to say a few things in French which he appreciated, and that set the tone for the night.

My FIRST impression was that this place is LOUD! Why is that for such a fine dining place? Well it's SMALL...I counted about 50 or so max seats and there is nothing to absorb the sound so it does get quite loud in here. Thus not ideal for a QUIET romantic date in my view.

BUT, the REST of the story.....our waiter Brian was really excellent. Very friendly and knowledgable and actually let us try some wines before we purchased them. Not many restaurants let you do that. So we're off to a good start. The Menu is quite limited which to me suggests quality in that they FOCUS on a few things and execute well.....that's my theory anyway. So putting it to the test....

We got the Celery Root Soup and Moroccan Dates stuffed with Chevre Salad. My GOD were these ever so GOOD! The soup was sublte with the cream but it packed an awesome flavor! I snarfed that down (as politely as I could in a fine dining restaurant without being thrown out). The Salad was extraordinary! How often do you say that about a SALAD??? Well THIS one was truly exceptional as the freshness of the dates stuffed with Chevre was sublime. 

We both got seafood dishes as our mains. I got the Mediterranean White Sea Bass Mediterranean White Sea Bass served with olives, basil, braised lentils, chanterelles, spring onions, herb buerre blanc sauce. Our waiter Brian gave me more of the Herb Buerre Blanc sauce which was ridiculously good! The Sea Bass had the skin on which gave it a stronger flavor and the fish tasted different that the typical Chilean Sea Bass that I'm used to. But with the Buerre Blanc sauce it was very good. Our other dish was the Wild Alaskan Halibut with farmers market ratatouille, micro greens, shrimp basil beignet, and a balsamic emulsion sauce. Of the two the Halibut was the better dish, but both were outstanding!

We were both stuffed, but I couldn't leave a French Restaurant without trying an Apple Tart. It was very good, but not quite what I expected. Maybe that's my problem.....I just got back from Europe, Normandie to be specific where the Apple Tart reigns supreme, so I was expecting something like that. But this one was unique in it's presentation, as the pastry was intertwined within the round apple \"cylinder.\" I've posted some pics of the entire dinner so you can see what it looked like.

Overall, and especially after it quieted down, this was an excellent dinner! High quality food with very professional wait staff. Oh the wine list is Franco-centric, which you'd expect. Decent selections by the glass but be prepared to pay Top Dollar for French bottles. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough about how special this place is! My wife and I went there for her 30th birthday, and it was exactly the kind of perfect dining experience I had hoped it would be. From the hostess to the maitre d' Ramsey who recommended food and wine to the waiters who were very attentive but not overbearing, the staff was exactly the kind of staff you'd want at a nice restaurant: knowledgeable and friendly while making us feel like they were paying us special attention. Ramsey in particular was very helpful in recommending different parts of the menu while not just highlighting the most expensive dishes.

My wife started out with the Bosc pear salad and for an entree had the Alaskan salmon, and I started with the sweet pea appetizer and had the rabbit two ways for my entree. Everything was cooked perfectly, plated beautifully, and was the exact right portion size for the richness of the food. My wife in particular said her salad was the best salad she had ever had and I've never had salmon cooked as perfectly as the bite of hers I had. My sweet pea appetizer included a kind of ravioli filled with Mascarpone cheese and was swimming in a rich brown broth poured at the table. My rabbit entree was delicious and a real treat as I'd never had rabbit before. We each also had wine and since it was a birthday dinner we were given complimentary macaroons that were made perfectly.

The decor is great too, and each table includes a bit of a view of the small kitchen where you're able to see the chefs working. It's an intimate restaurant decorated in silvers and golds with soft textures and dim lighting. It all fits the neighborhood and the price of the food very well. 

We didn't each do the whole appetizer-salad-entree-desert-drinks menu, but for one appetizer, one salad, two entrees, and two glasses of wine, our bill was $114 before tip. The food we ordered wasn't the most expensive or cheapest on the menu, but everything was a solid middle price. Their menu apparently changes regularly, so I'm excited to see what it looks like again in a couple months."}
{"text":"Dined here with the hubs and in-laws for restaurant week and it was SO worth it. Typically most restaurants are chaotic during restaurant week, not Lumiere. We came about a 1/2 hour before our reservations and sat at the bar. You can see directly into the kitchen from the bar and when I tell you the chef's we're just flowing. They were in a groove and it was pleasant to see, considering the packed place. Customer service is 10 out of 10. Even at the bar we had servers, managers and the bartenders making sure we were good and didn't need anything. They have wine specials going to by the way. French food without wine? Never :) 

Of course the restaurant week menu is modified. So here goes it. Amuse-Bouche was fresh baked french gougeres and sweet corn bisque is the first thing that came to the table. The bisque was OUT OF THIS WORLD! Too bad is was just enough for a taste. I would've gladly taken a bowl. First course, three of had the shrimp bouillabaisse, mom-in-law couldn't pick just one and the restaurant accommodated that (WIN). Mom-in-law had the escargot and the spanish octopus. She said it was the BEST escargot she's ever had and she is very well traveled as well as a super foodie. First course was a hit. Second course hubs and I had the Pork tenderloin with lobster mac and cheese, dad-n-law had the catch of the day (swordfish) and mom-n-law had the duck. Again grand slam. I wanted more mac though, it was an extremely small portion. Dessert I have the richest chocolate torte I've ever had, delicious but couldn't finish it. In-laws had the Salted butter apple galette which I know was good bc they scraped the plate. 

While the portions were small, I left feeling very satisfied and not overly stuffed. Mother-N-Law said this place is in her top 3 restaurants. Our server was Joey, who did an amazing job serving us and creating a wonderful experience (and he's NEW there). All of the staff we encountered was exceptional. Needless to say...we will definitely undoubtedly be back!

Here is the restaurant week menu for 2017 - http://www.charlotterestaurantweek.com/articles/charlotte-restaurant-week-472865-472865/lumiere-french-kitchen-15933273/"}
{"text":"I visited again recently and this meal was even better than the last. Lumiere pushes my palate  in fun and delicious directions. I'm not sure I have the vocabulary to explain how lovely our evening was. The bottle of wine they had on special for $30 was a tremendous value."}
{"text":"Lumiere is one of the better French restaurants in Charlotte and my husband and I come here every couple of months for a nice bottle of wine and a fancy dinner.

Owned and operated by the same team as The Liberty, this restaurant is great for a special occasion or romantic date night. Make a reservation for weekends, as they can get a little busy. The plates are a feast for the eyes...presentation is very important to the chef.

Located in a strip mall next to the Harris Teeter at Queens and Providence, the restaurant is small and cozy, with low lighting and artsy furnishings. If you're dining alone or with a friend I suggest sitting at their bar. It's only a few seats wide, but you can watch all of the action in the kitchen while you dine. 

I've tried most of the items on their menu and I would highly recommend starting with any of their salads, their oysters on the half shell and/or their scallops. The scallops are always cooked perfectly! For the main courses, I tend to prefer their seafood; however, the duck l'orange is a signature dish of theirs, and their beef dishes are always prepared very well. DEFINITELY save room for the dessert. Their creme brulees are to die for. Last time I had a black cherry creme brulee with a layer of chocolate ganache. It was incredible!"}
{"text":"I have been fortunate to dine in many places all over the world. So for me to say that Lumiere is in my top 5 is saying a lot. It also is a very unlikely location (a small strip mall) for such a fine dining experience. But do not let that fool you - this is excellent french cuisine!

The interior is well decorated, and the service team is very friendly. We had escargot, french onion soup, and the duck confit for starters. All amazing. They also brought an amuse bouche of a soup shot and a pastry that were both great.

The entrees were fantastic! So much going on each plate, with a generous serving. I had a filet mignon served over a brioche with seared foie gras, black truffles, asparagus, and mush rooms. Simply divine. My girlfriend had a pork chop, with chorizo pork sausage, french beans, and something else I forget - also amazing.

And dessert was great too - black cherry creme brulee with lemon sorbet and flourless chocolate torte with brown butter gelato with marshmellow glaze. From start to finish, an excellent dinner in what I would consider a \"hole-in-the-wall\" location. If I lived in Charlotte, I would be eating here regularly."}
{"text":"Went here for restaurant week. Had the escargot which were in a puff pastry, very flavorful and tasty.  Hanger steak was tender and good. Dessert was disappointing since I was looking forward to the chocolate cake and was told that it had nuts in the flour.  (Allergic) I opted for the cheese plate that was on the sad side.  I always look at the restaurant menus carefully for restaurant week because I want to make sure there is a yummy dessert I can have and nuts were not listed as an ingredient on the menu for the cake.  Kudos to the waitress for saving me from anaphylactic shock!!  Wonderful service beautiful presentation."}
{"text":"I love french food, but I would only consider this menu \"french twist.\" Just because I ordered escargot doesn't make me feel like I'm back in France. I also tried the oysters (awesome) and my main dish was scallops. Prices seemed quite high, but the quality was good."}
{"text":"If you're looking for great presentation of your food, this is where it's at. The service is incredible and the ambiance is superb. I can see why people rate it high on Yelp. I've been to this restaurant more than once and what is missing is flavor. Without flavor those other parts (service, presentation...) mean nothing. 

We ordered mussels for appetizers, and I love mussels, but, I couldn't bring myself to finish the bowl. It tasted dirty and drenched in wine... Not sure if the alcohol was completed cooked off (which completely turned off my pregnant wife.) My wife had the trout and I ordered the fillet tenderloin. I was unimpressed with both. 

Lumiere, you folks have to see the light, and develop your flavors."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this place. Between the stellar wine selection and the incredible French cuisine, it's hard not to want to come every week. I highly recommend the foie gras and the escargot!!"}
{"text":"This place was great. Our server was delightful. He was very helpful on menu selections and did a great job mixing up a variety of drinks for us. We started off with the oysters which were delicious, and shared a salad with an egg in it which was great. I ordered the steak for my meal and my friend ordered the boar, both were delightful. Definitely will be going back again!"}
{"text":"This gem of a restaurant is my idea of a perfect night out.  The waitstaff is attentive without being cloying, and personable without being nosy.  The ambience is pleasant, with a buzz of conversation and no screens in sight.  The food is exquisite.  My scallops were cooked perfectly, the foie gras special has been exquisite every time I've tried it, and the weekday specials are a deal...this Tuesday is was bouillabaisse with a crisp glass of white for $30.  Bon Appetit!"}
{"text":"Lumiere has some of the best service and food in Charlotte. Lisa is definitely one of the nicest, most knowledgeable servers around. The specials they run each week are very appetizing, and although they may look small in size when first brought to the table, they're rich and filling. The last Friday we were there we had the lobster/steak combo special with a glass of French wine for only $35, which was also a good value.

What sets this place apart from other fine dining places in town, aside from the awesome service, is the focus on small touches. From the nice glassware and white table cloths to the amuse-bouche (small appetizer of a cheese pastry with soup du jour), you will be sure to leave thoroughly impressed. It's hard to believe this place used to be an Einstein Bagels! The decor is comfortable, though if I was in charge of the lighting, I might turn the lumens down a bit. 

An evening at Lumiere is generally preceded by a visit to the HT wine bar (sorry Charlotte Agenda...had that idea long before you). Look forward to visiting again soon!"}
{"text":"This was the second time I dined at Lumiere... after my first disappointing visit (sullen waitstaff and mediocre food), I decided to visit again for the Julia Child prix fixe March event.  The Observer provided a nice write-up and since I am fan of Julia and french cooking, my friends and I decided to make reservations.   Upon arriving at the restaurant, I was, once again, greeted with a less than pleasant hostess and when we inquired about the March prix fixe specials, we were told that the special was not for that night. However, we could order moules et frites with a glass of wine and dessert for 25.00.  Since that was not what was advertised, we expressed our disappointment. Our server said she would inquire... and of course, after a few minutes, said that they would provide an exception for just that night.   After I went home, I re-read the advertisement \" Julia Child Birthday celebration during the month of March prior to 6:30.Prix Fixe three course: 35.00/per person.   Since we met the criteria per the advertisement, I decided to provide other customers with this review.  Since Charlotte has some wonderful restaurants (and a new French restaurant within walking distance of Lumiere), I will not be patronizing this establishment in the future."}
{"text":"This is the best meal I've had in Charlotte in years. Every component on every dish was perfect. Service was wonderful-I appreciated having a seasoned waiter who was thoughtful & professional. Ambiance was nice-cozy & romantic."}
{"text":"With the new Beauty and the Beast live action movie recently releasing I thought it would be appropriate to come here and pay homage to one of my favorite candlesticks. There aren't any Disney characters strewn through this restaurant though there are some tasteful decorations through the restaurant that lend it some charm such as the enameled cast iron dutch ovens (a french cooking staple) lining the glass in the kitchen.

I gotta say the food and service here knocked me out of the park with their small touches such an an amuse bouche before your meal begins. We got a pear and gruyere bisque paired with a hot out of the oven mini brioche. This little bun was freaking delicious. Put that sucker on the menu so I can order more please. We then started the meal proper with the hearts of palm salad with lobster and confit duck leg with chocolate sauce. They are both stunning presentation wise and really perfect ways to start a meal. The lobster was just the right amount to not get bored of it and the chocolate on the duck was subtle enough to not overpower things and turn it into a dessert duck.

As for my entree I went with a rack of lamb with smoked eggplant and saffron encrusted turnip (the special for that night) and it was excellent. Though not as exciting as the fish course of my dining companion which was a tasty and well cooked chilean sea bass.

At this point we were too full for dessert so had to skip on that. But I'm eyeing that bread pudding for next time. Thanks for the wonderful meal Lumiere! You always were my favorite character in Beauty and the Beast."}
{"text":"I have mixed feeling about Lumiere's. The staff is wonderful! There is nothing I hate more than when you go to an expensive restaurant and the staff is pretentious, not here! These people are wonderful! Love this aspect! The drink menu and wine list are perfect. You feel very comfortable here.

We came on a holiday so the execution was over the top for a holiday and everything came out just perfect. I can tell chef loves presentation and execution. Everything was prepared very well. He's very into deconstructed food for presentation. My Duck a l'orange was beautiful on the plate. The duck was perfectly cooked, it was New Years. That's a tall order, but the flavors were all separated. I'm a chef, not on this level, but I thought this guy is so amazing. If I could have had his dish with the flavor palate the way it was meant be...with him spinning it.  That was my disappointed. I overheard another table comment on the duck and remanisce about an old restaurant in town. So that was what I would say. So close, but just out of reach of perfection for me."}
{"text":"One of the absolute nicest dinning experiences I've ever had! Great food and Great service!

I went with my fiancé for restaurant week and this place exceeded all expectations. I really don't have ANY CRITICISM. The food was excellent and the service was perfect. Very professional, polite, tentative, but not overly persistent. 

I'm a very picky eater and I wanted to try everything because the plating was so beautiful. I could describe how every dish had the perfect balance and compliment of flavors, but I'll let the pictures speak to you!"}
{"text":"great service and mixologists! awesome presentation of various dishes"}
{"text":"FINALLY Charlotte. Amazing food, beautiful presentation, great service and good wine! Everything we ate was delicious! And, 50x better than Liberty!"}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times. You might think this can't be a weekly spot because it's \"French\" but they do weekly specials and you can sign up to get their weekly emails letting you know what those specials are. Typically dinner and a glass of wine for $30 or $40. Well worth it!  The service has been spot on with the elevated dining experience expectation. The food has been phenomenal. It is definitely worth going to and I think I might make these an every couple of weeks dining option. There aren't too many legit French restaurants I think QC."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I got an app, entree, and dessert each. The apps and entrees were excellent! Serving size was small but after three courses we were well satisfied. Their duck is on point. Get the foie gras!! It's not as fatty and other foie gras I've had but it could be one of my favorite! It's kinda like concentrated essence of duck, and the candied preserved walnuts that go with it are awesome. 

The desserts we could have skipped on, they were not very good, and the service was a pretty lacking for what should be fine dining. We spent a total of about $70. The foie gras was $14 but very worth it, the entrees were $30 and the desserts were $12. If everything was priced a little lower they would get four stars but for the price they are charging I expect either exceptional food or exceptional service but they missed on both."}
{"text":"A rare 5 star experience. Waiters a little pompous. Appetizers very good! Steaks and seafood dishes cooked perfectly as is the pork or boar. Desserts average to above average."}
{"text":"Unassuming Myers Park strip center restaurant is a hidden gem. A little formal, this isn't your jeans and sneakers quick dinner spot. 

Serving modern French food with mature, career waitstaff who take pride in every detail, you'll be guided with confidence and served with pleasure among the neighborhood regulars. 

The various fish specials and soups are my favorites. Great desserts as well."}
{"text":"Love this place! Greate wine selection with well made dishes of high quality ingredients, good taste and beautiful presentation."}
{"text":"Lumiere? C'est manifique! What a truly enjoyable experience it was dining at Lumiere. Admittedly, this was a place I'd never heard of until a fellow yelp friend suggested trying it for restaurant week so I was completely unsure of what to expect.

Lumiere is literally tucked into the shopping center that's directly across the lot from the Myers Park Harris Teeter. Upon walking in, I was greeted by the hostess and led directly back to the table. The interior is not exactly big on space but that lends to the general ambiance and intimacy of the place.

We were greeted by our waiter for the night, Joey, who was AWESOME. He provided useful suggestions and was not shy in giving his opinions and personal menu favorites. I went with a rose champagne and gave my order from the restaurant week menu:

For the starter, rather amuse-bouche, we were presented with a mini roll and sweet corn bisque. So fresh and good to the last drop.

1st course- jumbo shrimp bouillabaisse. Jumbo piece of shrimp, jumbo punch of flavor. The broth was down right drinkable.

2nd course - pork with lobster mac & cheese. So flavorful and the mac & cheese was perfectly cooked.

3rd (dessert) course - chocolate torte. This was soooo rich but it was exactly what I was craving. I enjoyed every last bite!

Definitely a five star dining experience from start to finish. I cannot recommend Lumiere highly enough."}
{"text":"I could wrap up this review in one word: decadent. For more explanation, read on!

We had a 6:30 reservation on a Saturday night; we arrived about 15 minutes early and were promptly seated in a booth. We had thought about having a pre-dinner drink at the bar and were immediately glad we didn't when we saw that the bar only had 3 seats... this is definitely a meal-only place, but what a meal it was! Booths line the wall and there are tables in the middle. The decor is sparse but modern and cozy. A trip to the restroom also revealed a pretty extensive wine cellar in the back of the restaurant.

We started with a duck confit appetizer and bottle of Rhone that our incredibly knowledgeable, patient, helpful, and friendly waitress suggested. Neither the fella nor I know anything about French wines, and the list was as extensive as the cellar! The duck was incredible and was preceded by a lobster bisque amuse-bouche and light, buttery, steaming hot rolls. For dinner, I got the wild boar with truffle mac and cheese, and the fella got the rabbit. After tasting each others, we couldn't come to a conclusion on who had picked the better entree because they were both so amazing. Since we were in a \"blow it out\" sort of mood, we then ordered the creme brulee for dessert. Mmmm... there just aren't words. After that, our waitress brought us some complimentary marizpan petit fours for one last, sweet bite.

This is definitely a special occasion place with special occasion prices, but it is well worth the trip. The service, ambiance, and food are out of this world, and Lumiere has officially become one of my top fine dining spots in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and the overall experience was good on both occasions. The starters and entrees were wonderful, the service friendly and snappy, and the decor is simple and unobtrusive.  A recent favorite was the beet salad and the duck.

So why 3 stars? In a word: the desserts. Both times they were sub-par, which I find puzzling. 

For example, I recently had the flourless chocolate cake with gelato. The cake was served too cold, it was hard to discern the presence of chocolate flavor, and it was way too dense. A better description would have been \"Unappealing brick with a passing nod to chocolate\""}
{"text":"We are from Chicago and here on business and found Lumiere on Yelp. Strip mall location is deceiving. Lovely atmosphere, great service and very good food. An updated spin on what appears to be a traditional French menu. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"It would be hard to say how much I wish I could give this restaurant a \"5 star\" review.  It is just the kind of spot that I truly love, having owned a small restaurant, and knowing the amount of time and effort it takes to \"get it right.\"
The decor is very nice, the waiter was excellent, comfortable with the menu and a great server.  Timing was perfect throughout the evening.  
The French Onion soup was wonderful, hot, luxuriously thick and tasty.  The bread was excellent.  
However, the entree was such a disappointment.  I ordered the duck entree from the menu.  The presentation was lovely.... but the entree was lukewarm at best.  Perhaps I missed it on the menu, but I really don't think it was meant to be served at room temperature.  I was anticipating a crackling hot duck breast to savor.  The flavors of the accompanying sauces were good, but the barely warm temperature just dragged it all down.
The other people in our party enjoyed their entrees, which were all very nicely presented.
Desserts were also beautiful and tasty.
All in all, I would certainly try this lovely spot again, and hope to get back there,"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time for restaurant week in Jan.  Have gone back afterwards for normal dinners and the food is just as good!  This is the perfect place to take out of towners for a nice meal out, especially if they like duck."}
{"text":"The presentation matters just as much as the taste at Lumiere French Kitchen. All of the dishes are beautiful to look at and taste amazing. The escargot and the bread pudding were incredible. Service and overall atmosphere was excellent. Only reason it does not get 5/5 is because of location.  It sits unassumingly in a strip mall."}
{"text":"Since attending the first tasting way back at The Liberty months ago, I have wanted to dine at Lumiere. My daughter and I saw the add for the Tasting menu and thought  what a great way to try this new french boutique restaurant. The interior of the restaurant is modern , with clean lines. Very pleasing to the eye with a view into the kitchen. We were greeted by a very pleasant server named Stacy. She gave us the wine list and menu. There was actually Two Tasting Menu's, a three course one for 45.00 and a five course one for 65.00. We chose the Five course. The wine list is a little pricey-mostly wines over 100.00 a piece. I think they should offer more options for people to try the wonderful French roses' at a better price. We opted for a St Emilion Bordeaux . We started out with a delicious Amuse Bouche of a Mushroom Potato Bisque, just heavenly and served with an extra treat - a cheese Gougere!  On to a Foie Gras Torchon,which was delicious but a little too cold and then into the 2nd course of a Lemon Ricotta Agnolotti in a great sauce of Tomato. capers and olives and fried parsley.  It was  delightful. Then \"A\" Scallop with a Lobster sauce, could have used more than the one. 4th Course is the Double Cut Lamb Chops-Delicous!
Topped off the night with a Coffee Pots de Creme and a French Macaroon. It was a great tasting, the regular menu looked awesome!  The only negatives were the  way expensive wine list and I felt rushed. I don't like to be rushed with a 65.00 menu!"}
{"text":"Good food experience, lightweight service.  We enjoyed so many great things here, and the last several visits have been truly memorable as the whole meal was put together well with very attentive service.

I had a pear martini (they always have great drinks), seared foie gras, and trout - very nice.  However, at a restaurant with this level of quality and at higher price, I expect a high level of service.  

Nothing was terrible, but I feel like it is was missing polish.   Our water and wine were frequently empty - we needed to ask for more or pour our own.   I also remember last time there were beautiful finishing touches, like a chocolate truffle and handshake from the manager on our way out.  The night's special was also not fully outlined by our server (didn't mention dessert that was supposed to come with it).

I guess I would say our experienced was not as \"magical\" as last time.  I'm not sure if we'll return given it is an higher priced restaurant and just expect it based on prior experiences."}
{"text":"My wife and I had the pleasure of dining at lumiere during restaurant week. What a treat to be able to try in a fine restaurant without mortgaging your house. This place is the real deal. The words \"oh my god\" we're used frequently. The food was amazing. From the begging to the end. Fresh fish, perfectly cooked beef, deliciously unique and strong drinks. A lovely server named Ramsey to put it all together for a great night out. My only complaint, and I may be off base here, but the place is in a strip mall. Now you can classify that as a diamond in the rough, if you want to put a positive spin on things. But that just threw me off a bit. But all in all a great dining experience and that's what this is about. Thank you Lumiere!!!"}
{"text":"Christmas Eve dinner outside the home is generally a hit or miss option. Those restaurants that are open often serve with understandable detachment due to their desire to be anywhere but there.Our experience last night at Lumiere shattered that stereotype. Chris, our server could not have been nicer. He was spot on w/suggestions and he executed flawlessly. Foie Gras, carpaccio & oysters flowed to entrees of Duck, lamb, scallops that were wonderful but secondary to the Bouchard Poilly-divine! House made desserts rounded out a wonderful evening. We can't wait to return try out some additional items."}
{"text":"Love Lumiere. I have been here a few times and every time it is a treat. The food is fresh, creative and delicious. The brioche is really good. I highly recommend the duck and the scallops."}
{"text":"First time to Lumiere last week and it lived up to what I had heard from my friends. This is definitely a special night restaurant however the prices are reasonable for the experience (a good return on investment!) making it a good \"just because\" choice as well.
I started with an Old Fashioned garnished with a beautiful charred orange peel (wish he had added a cherry too.) I ordered the Duck a L'Orange which was perfectly prepared - tender and flavorful but not overpoweringly \"orange-y\" like some restaurants do. It came with interesting vegetables which I always like.
My host ordered the special Steak au Poivre which was flavorful but not exactly pepper-y. It could have used more black pepper according to my dining companion.
My only slightly negative comment is that although I like the size of the restaurant, it doesn't feel exactly cozy - maybe it's the lighting? There also is no bar to speak of and often I dine alone and always want to sit at the bar rather than at a table. I don't know if I would go to Lumiere by myself for that reason.
I enjoyed Lumiere and will certainly recommend it."}
{"text":"My vote is actually 3 1/2. I want to love a French restaurant in my neighborhood and it looks like most people are crazy about Lumiere. I have been a few times and briefly, the decor is beautiful and soothing. The noise level is quite high. The service is a bit off. Sometimes it seems a bit unfriendly and sometimes simply poor. Sometimes it is pleasant, but I pick up a bit of an unhappy vibe. Food-wise, the escargot with Pernod were divine and salads have been very good. Same with cocktails and wine suggestions. The bread is delicious. Several dishes have been uber-salty.  I am a huge duck fan, but the meat in the duck confit was way too salty. In fact because of that, I recently requested low salt on my scallop entree - the scallops arrived, loaded with coarse salt!  The kitchen crew, visible thru a big open window, looks super organized and professional. Well, c'est la vie - I'll try again."}
{"text":"This wonderful French restaurant in Myers Park excels at presentation. From the warm, modern feel of the intimate dining room, to the soft glow cast on each perfectly coiffed dish by the low overhead lighting, it all adds up to the perfect setting for anything from a romantic dinner for two  to a formal meal with business colleagues. 

The service is absolutely impeccable, the wine list a near-masterpiece, and the food superb. On a recent visit with friends, we started off with a succulent Foie Gras, along with a delicious Soft-shell Crab appetizer. Our server -- attentive to our every need -- recommended a superb Rhône wine, followed by a perfectly balanced French red blend for our entrees. 

For dinner, I enjoyed a wonderful dish of Seared Scallops, while my wife dove into a plate of prime rib. We were impressed with everything about the meal, the setting and the service, and would definitely make a return visit.

Unfortunately, it appears that Lumiere has closed its doors as of May 31, 2018. Hoping this is a temporary situation, following the recent death of its co-owner. A Charlotte restaurant scene without Lumiere will definitely be a lot less interesting."}
{"text":"This unassuming little spot in a Myers Park strip mall is quickly becoming one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte. Admittedly, their regular menu is on the pricey side. In fact, I'd only been once during restaurant week because the high prices scared me away. (During that visit, I loved every bite. Lumiere's flavors are fresh and well balanced with the deep richness you expect from French food.) But, after getting weekly emails highlighting $25 entree & wine specials like duck a l'orange, fall bouillabaisse, beef bourguignon and more, I couldn't resist going back. 

On this visit, I had the bouillabaisse special that included a nice glass of Rhone. This seafood stew simply blew me away. I have no idea how they can serve that delicious dish -- full of octopus, artic char, scallops, shrimp, mussels, clams & lobster -- for $25 but I'll take it!! My boyfriend had the scallops. Served with pork belly for $30, it wasn't bad but seriously you guys. The Tuesday night special is the way to go. 

My favorite part about Lumiere is the top notch service. (Great service is getting harder and harder to find in Charlotte.) Everyone from the wait staff to the hostess to the expediter fall over themselves to treat each and every guest like a VIP. They're all so knowledgeable about the menu as well and happy to talk food, describe dishes, etc. for days."}
{"text":"Food and service were excellent. Seth was our server and was very helpful navigating the menu (i.e. He translated things written in French without us having to even ask). All his recommendations were spot on. I had the filet mignon - was one of the best I've had and the Mac and cheese. Delicious and a unique flavor I hadn't had before. Fiancé had the lamb rack and loved it. Also - the leek soup and bioche that came out before our meal was amazing. I could go there and just drink the wine and eat the bread. 

This is totally a place that could be pretentious but isn't. The hostess was really nice and not at all snotty - and everyone else we interacted with had the same cool vibe."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first visit to this quaint restaurant. We all tried the Queen's Feast Menu, which is always a fun way to experience new restaurants and try new dishes. The main course item I had was the Scottish Salmon with mushrooms and spinach. It was excellent!  The dessert items were all small but reasonable portions. Our waiter was very knowledgeable and many compliments to the chef. The fine details didn't go unnoticed!"}
{"text":"The food presentation is amazing, service was good but this is the 2nd time I've visited and both times I felt the dishes lacked much needed finishing salt and seasoning. Lobster Paella was good, looked beautiful but was bland, the boar chops were bland and the dish was very fatty. 
$30 corkage fee in case anyone wants to know.
With all the hype this place gets I think I'll let everyone else try it and move on to some other places that the food is just more flavorful."}
{"text":"Was super fortunate enough to be invited to dinner during restaurant week by some friends.  I am SO glad I went.  

I've always driven by this shopping center, but never had an excuse to go (with the exception of the massive Teeter... I usually try to avoid that intersection of Queens/Queens/Providence/Selwyn due to the fact that I almost always get lost.  With my trusty phone I navigated the traffic (which tends to build in the intersection) - Great tip is that you can drive around the Harris Teeter in the back parking lot and you can avoid the traffic build up or trying to have to turn left through that stuff.

Once you walk in, the hostess stand had a nice station and we were greeted warmly. - Coats taken (which was a feat in-itself since she managed to fit 4 coats on one hanger) and we were seated.

Our server James was excellent.  I know this week is probably a nightmare for restaurant employees since it gets so busy, but he was super nice and our meal went off without a hitch.

I really should have taken a photo of the menu because this next part of my review is going to butcher their food descriptions....  I'll try my best.  The menu did have a ton of options (it was hard to choose) the app / main / dessert, but really it seems like they put their best \"food\" forward (pardon the pun) so any combination would have been a winner.  For the amuse, we had a fresh baked Cheese gougeres with an apple bisque (something else was in the bisque, but I couldn't quite catch the description).... The small shot of soup warmed the stomach up for the impeding awesomeness of our meal and went perfectly with the gougere.

My pick for the app course was the froi gras and mushroom bisque.  The bowl is served with a piece of brioche (froi gras on top with micro greens) and the soup is poured in front of you at the table.... nice extra flair for service there.  I pretty much inhaled it, but the soup was super smooth and melt in your mouth (if you love mushrooms, don't miss out on this bisque).

My main course I was flip/flopping and made a game-time decision to go with the Pork Loin Chop, braised pork belly, and lobster mac and cheese.  The chop was GINORMOUS! and the pork belly was delicious (as always).  Presentation for the dish was really on point.

I was getting full at that point, but dessert was on its way!  My choice was the black cherry chocolate creme brulee.  Definitely not a sweets person, but this was pretty darn great.  It also came with a side of hazelnut icecream (bonus!).

Overall the experience of Lumiere was super positive.  A real, top-to-bottom, details-covered restaurant.  The dining room may be on the small side, but they definitely know what they are doing here.  From the intimate booths along the walls to the small 3-stool \"bar\" and the kitchen where you can see the chef's hard at work to show case their great food offerings.  Lumiere is definitely on my radar now and I hope to be back (sans restaurant week) to sample their regular menu items.  

Just wanted to put a disclaimer on this review due to the fact that \"I'm not an expert in French cuisine...\".  My expertise is mainly stuffing my face with food so hopefully this review is helpful."}
{"text":"How do you know when you find a great restaurant ?  

For myself, it is by how many times I visit it as compared to others.  Well, i have been to Lumieres at least 4 times in the past couple of months which is a lot for me compared to others. 

The reason why is the \"GREAT  VALUE \" on the weekdays at $25.00 !!  I have been going to Lumiere for almost a year now and have to say that Chef Tom continues to exceed my food experience expectations. The spectacular food presentation is only exceeded by the \"finesse\" and \"skill\" used to create the the most wonderful tasting food.  Recently, I have had a most refreshing cucumber based potato leek soup, a most tender, delicately cooked Quail and Egg, decadent Lobster Thermidor, and very delightful Paris-Brest Puff Pastry w/ a Praline Creme.  

Checkout the photos! But, more importantly go visit Lumiere and experience the cuisine."}
{"text":"The mac n cheese with truffles is the most wonderful thing I have ever tasted. The rabbit was also very, very good. I recommend both very highly."}
{"text":"I hate to write this review because I don't want even more competition for the best restaurant week deal in Charlotte but I am feeling generous today.

Going to Lumiere just feels like a special occasion, even though I've only been during Restaurant Week. The courses are comparable to their normal menu and since one featured entrée can set you back $30 during a normal week so $35 for 3 courses and an amuse bouche is a steal. They also offer a red or a white wine for $30 which makes this my perfect meal. 

The last visit we started with two fresh bake gougeres (one each). They are light and fluffy cheese bread bites and are divine. They also bring a cute little espresso cup with a soup, this month it was a delicious oyster and truffle. Now normally I would think that is a weird soup but trust me it was delicious! 

I started with a scallop which was expertly presented on a black plate with white sauce around. My main was the beef dou which was a perfect medium filet and slow braised fall off the bone short ribs. Both had perfect accompaniments. My fiancé raved about his bouillabaisse and had enough lobster that he shared a large chunk with me! I was impressed with the amount of quality seafood in his dish. I ended with the most wonderful flourless chocolate tort that was surrounded by a complimentary Godiva cream. 

Every dish they bring out is beautifully presented. The wait staff has always been attentive, including clearing all the silverware and replacing it every course. The courses themselves feel deliberately timed, nothing rushed and nothing delayed. Dinner here is a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Absolutely stunning French restaurant!  After moving from New Orleans, I didn't think I could ever find a good restaurant again. I was so wrong. I have never had a mediocre dish here. Everything is delectable!"}
{"text":"This review is based on restaurant week.

We wanted to try somewhere different this time around for restaurant week and Lumiere seemed like the perfect option.

My husband and I were promptly seated when we arrived.  The waiter was very friendly and brought us waters.  We were indecisive about our wine bottle choice but had a staff member help us pick out a bottle in our price range.  

We both ordered the scallops and the chocolate tort.  We ordered different entrees to share I ordered duck, John ordered beef.  

We received soup and cheese bread as a started. My initial reaction was wowwwww the portions are soooo tiny.  I was basically licking the little cup clean because it was so amazing.

The second course was the scallop and lobster dish.  This was delightful and amazing as well.  

My duck was really good, but Johns beef dish was out of this world.  

The portions were so small so I was still starving and would have been content with some bread.  I noticed other tables got bread, so we might have gotten missed.

I'm saving the best for last...the chocolate tort.  OMGGG it was so good.  

Overall service was good."}
{"text":"If you miss Europe, you should visit Lumiere. In short, the flavors, service, wine suggestions, presentation, and value was all right on point.  We went for the tasting menu, but started with the oysters.  I can't say no to an oniony flavor and some melted butter on a chargrilled oyster! They were great, and served beautifully with very course salt and whole spices for presentation. They gave us an espresso-sized cup of pallet cleansing soup - my dad asked for another! The pear salad missed the mark, but the filet mignon topped with fois de gras was faaantastic.  The final course was a creme brulee with hints of passion fruit.  Thinking of going back soon to see what's new."}
{"text":"With all the cold weather, and specifically snow, you would think it was time to visit a place with a name like \"Olaf\" (you know, from Frozen? Come on, people), but I couldn't find one of those - so instead we went with Beauty and the Beast, and Lumiere.

Actually, the movie - and the name, and the climate - had little to do with it. The restaurant had simply been on the list for a while, and it was finally time to check them off. Good thing, as their service was amazing. Though we did not have a reservation, and probably aren't used to such places, they did not mind a bit, happy to take my raggedy self in, and they were great all around - even offering a splash of wine to go with our appetizers (of course, they were likely hoping we would get some more, but we'll get some next time).

To compliment the service, the food was also excellent - not everything was completely to our taste, but there are going to be times when you don't like everything, and that's okay - the fact is that it was prepared really well, and the service was spot on, which made it a great evening, so we will definitely be back to try more of the items on their menu."}
{"text":"One of the most talented chefs in the city of Charlotte, and in the country, humbly perfects a menu that is a work of art at Lumiere French Kitchen.

The bar is set high, and for good reason.

Let's start with his daily amuse bouche - the tastiest, creamiest, flavor exploding soup of your life.

Follow that by a skillfully designed first course; be daring and try something that I guarantee you won't see on the competition's menu - like foie gras or escargot, you'll thank me!

The main course is always stunning.  This time I had the Dry Aged Hudson Valley Duck Breast.

There's so much that can be said about this place; it's on my Top 3 list in Charlotte, and there's nothing coming close to unseating that position."}
{"text":"When your prices say you should be getting an amazing dinner with amazing service in an amazing restaurant but only deliver a really good dinner with average service, expect an average rating.

Had a 9pm reservation. Arrived promptly at 8:50pm. Was told we would be seated at or shortly after 9pm. We ended getting seated at 9:35. What's the point of the reservation?

Food was really good, but underwhelming when you see the check. 

Service was average, good average.

Overall, it was an experience but the two things that came to my mind after were: our night started off poorly with a long wait, and the food was really good, but not $$$$ good. If the prices were lower but they delivered the same experience then I might think differently, but currently it Wouldn't be on top of our must-go places. Would only go back if someone invited us."}
{"text":"Went there for anniversary and was fantastic as has been the few times we have been. They had a grouper special that was delicious. Hearts of Palm app was the best!  Seth was great!"}
{"text":"Lumiere is truly as good as it gets for French cuisine in Charlotte. I've eaten here probably 5 times and always had an outstanding experience.  I recently dined on the pork cheeks which were kind of like a braised short rib consistency-truly incredible. Their seafood preparation is always great and I love the baba au rhum dessert. It's only for true rum lovers because it is strong! It's great for special occasions and if you subscribe to their newsletter, they offer discounted meals through the week!"}
{"text":"I debated whether I should update my review based on my most recent experience.  But it just came down to the fact that Lumiere is no longer my favorite restaurant in CLT, and I don't plan to return based on this experience.  

I am aware that Lumiere has a new chef, and was hopeful some of my husband's and my favorites would be just as good.  Sadly, that was not the case.

To begin, the amuse bouche (mushroom on this occasion) and carpaccio lacked seasoning.  The octopus--once my favorite of ANY restaurant's preparation--was tough, fishy, and the vinaigrette seasoning did nothing to enhance the flavor.  The rabbit special was huge in size, but EXTREMELY dry and lacking flavor.  The scallops were probably the best dish of the night, but the lentils were a bit too firm for my liking.  

Service was stellar, as usual.  We did not complain about a single dish when we were there, and we ate everything.  But it just wasn't good.  For the amount we spent on this meal--and our numerous prior experiences of being nothing but amazed--this was a sad revelation. 

I don't have any interest in returning."}
{"text":"I hate to give them a 3 and I know that goes against CW but...

1. Atmosphere-Is this a restaurant or operating room, it was bright, too bright. Almost no bar to speak of so if you go early have fun with that. The avg age of the room was 60 and I'm being generous. Good place to bring ur mother-n-law for her birthday dinner!

2. Menu-Pretty simple to the point of boring. Scallops, steak, fish and orange duck. Yawn. I get it have some staples, but there is nothing on that menu to get excited about. 

3. Service-Really great service for the most part. Felt a bit rushed so we had to pump the brakes a bit. 

4. Food-Again I would argue a simple menu, but everything they made from the food to the cocktails was fantastic."}
{"text":"Excellent food and wine list, very good service. Everything was artfully presented, crafted to perfection and very on point in timing and amount. The server gave great wine selection suggestions and the atmosphere was cozy and conducive to a great experience. Will be back!"}
{"text":"The place never fails to amaze! Great service. Quality, fresh, tasty food. The service is great."}
{"text":"Excellent excellent food. Excellent service. My husband took me here for my birthday and every member of the staff wished me a happy birthday. Champagne was brought to the table, delicious birthday dessert. Started with risotto and it was delicious. Lamb as my main was gorgeous and delicious. Yes, it's expensive but it's worth it. You get what you pay for here."}
{"text":"Simply amazing! I stumbled into this little French gem while on a business trip to Charlotte. The Flavors are fantastically vibrant. From the bar I loved being able to watch the kitchen team crank out one delicious meal after another. Don't miss the rum steeped dessert!"}
{"text":"I went with friends for restaurant week. Even though it was restaurant week, we had high expectations. 

THE FOOD
The food was beautifully placed and was, for the most part, delicious. The endive salad with Serrano ham was great. They asked if I wanted my duck a l'orange medium rare. I asked for medium. It came out medium rare anyway. The 'osso buco' had mixed reviews with my group. Shredded beef. We asked for more jus because it was dry. The flavor was good though. 

THE SERVICE
we couldn't decide if the server was rude or if he thought he was being funny. Either way it fell flat. One of my group didn't have her glasses and pointed to the item on the menu she wanted. He said he didn't have his glasses either and had no idea what she was pointing to. He didn't know what was the second app on the menu? He couldn't do more to help her? 

When asked if there was brioche with the foie gras, he said it says there is on the menu. He walked over to point out where it says it on the menu. He told 1 of the 2 of us who ordered the cheese plate which cheeses were on the plate (didn't actually point them out). When the other person asked, he said: I already told her, she can tell you. 

He rushed us through dinner. We were going to order a second bottle of wine but he started bussing empty glasses as soon as we put them down. He started taking empty first course plates before everyone was finished. He never offered us coffee or after dinner drinks. He never brought us bread. 

I use Restaurant Week to see where I'd like to go again. Treat us like you'd like to see us again."}
{"text":"Great service. Amazing food. My taste buds went on a roller coaster ride! Thanks for making my birthday dinner very special. We will be back. The Foie Gras was amazing!"}
{"text":"My husband made a reservation here the night he proposed, so on our 1 year anniversary we thought it'd be nice to return. I remember the food being really good, so I was excited to go.

Not sure, however, if it was the emotion of the night in winter 2016 or a new chef now, but this return visit was a disappointment.... The food was just not good ( bland and lacked seasoning)... It was pretty to look at, though.

The mussels still had that raw taste to them and the sauce they were in had a very strong alcohol taste. This put me off, especially being pregnant. 

I settled for the trout, which was Bland. I had to ask for salt from the waitress, and she seemed shocked... but this helped. The steak was okay, the puree that came with it was cold.

Although the server was very kind, and the kitchen expeditor was phenomenal. He kept track of the entire restaurant and knew when to fire off the entrees, the lack of knowledge really turned me off. Specifically, being pregnant I am not eating any raw eggs including chocolate mousse. So when she mentioned the Chocolate Mousse, and I asked what desserts do not have raw egg in it. She said the Chocolate Mousse does not have egg in it, and stated that it was whipped cream with chocolate syrup. Whaaaaat?

Whipped cream + chocolate syrup is NOT mousse. The kitchen is either unaware of a typical French dessert, or the staff is not educated on which food has a pregnancy salmonella risk.

But, let me be clear, the service was otherwise great... My issue was more with the the food. We did not formally complain, where would we have started?... \"Ummmm.... What happened to your chef?\".... We kept on with the meal, hoping it would redeem itself. By the time of dessert.... We tapped out.., especially with the unappealing whipped cream and chocolate syrup description. 

Perhaps, we should have left when the complimentary amuse-bouche was brought out. It was heavily under seasoned.... a harbinger of things to come.

Lesson learned...If the amuse-bouche, does not amuse your bouche... LEAVE."}
{"text":"Incredible birthday pass in this place, delicious food, wonderful attention.
Very rich duck to the orange, wooo thanks"}
{"text":"Excellent service, quality, and pace of the meal. I always forget about the little extras you receive with french dining.  The lobster bisque palate cleanser before the main course changed my life. Too bad we couldn't stay for dessert.   Next time."}
{"text":"I went here during restaurant week and thought the food was pretty good. I got the duck as my main course and it was cooked well with very good flavor. For dessert I got the rum cake, which I would not recommend. It tasted like I was drinking rum. The only way I could even eat it was pressing on it with a spoon to squeeze out most of the rum. The service was ok - they gave us dirty looks for opening birthday presents while we were there."}
{"text":"This place was well worth the $. The bread was something dreams are made of. Loved.it!"}
{"text":"Traditional French cuisine executed with precision in a very unassuming strip mall. Gives the term \"hole in the wall\" a new meaning."}
{"text":"Goodness gracious, I enjoyed my experience here way more than I thought I would. Happy to report that the hype is real. 
The Lady got me a reservation for Lumiere for Restaurant Week, and she had to do it well in advance (we figured that one out by failing the last Restaurant Week. So there's my pro-tip, make your reservations at least 2-2.5 weeks out). 
What really exceeded my expectations was how..professional everything was, and how much of a well-oiled machine Lumiere was. Some note-worthy things to mention: The people that you see out front? That's it. That's everybody running the restaurant. A couple chefs, waiters, and a front of house manager. Everybody gets along and respects each other, always giving precedence to the person with the food in their hands. The chefs cook for the waitstaff on Mondays. The waitstaff buys beer for the cooks on other nights. And everybody is professional and well trained in both the wine and food. Service was incredible the whole time we were there.
Oh, and one last thing. They ONLY serve their Restaurant Week during the event - that cuts down on the confusion and allows them to truly make their food they serve exceptional. And that it was.

Menu started off with an Amuse Bouche (French for mouth-teaser) of a delicious cheese puff pastry with a sweet corn soup served in the cutest lil mug you've ever seen. First course: I ordered the escargots, which I love, but I had never eaten them in the shell! It's fun to work for your food, as anybody knows who enjoys crab legs, and the reward of pulling the snails out of the shell was well worth it. Served with a great herb butter. Win. Main Course: Seared duck with a few other things (piece of bok choy, cherry, pan sauce). So freakin' tender and flavorful. What a wonderful dish. Dessert: I chose the profiteroles, which was incredible. The Lady got the Salted Caramel Apple Gallette and that almost beat mine out. 

With wine dinners and weeknight specials, I am SO excited to get back to Lumiere for my next French meal."}
{"text":"We went for restaurant week and the meal we had was absolutely fabulous. Started with the French martini, which was delicious and pink. I got the scallop, bouillabaisse, and Apple galette and my husband got the mushroom and pate bisque, beef duo, and chocolate torte. We loved every single thing. It was busy because of restaurant week so our server was a little slow, but because the food was so good I'm giving a 5. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wow!! If they can deliver these dishes during restaurant week then we must go back! A very stylish setting; great ambience and a super vibe. The restaurant was full yet service was prompt and top class; food came quick, superbly plated  and very tasty. There were three of us so we got to taste a good deal of the menu and not one plate disappointed. Kudos too for a cheese-plate as a desert during Queens Feast. Our server had good wine recommendations. The only drawback I would say is the bar is very small; maybe by design, but it makes it hard to drop in without a reservation to have an appetizer or two and glass of wine (or two)."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful mid-week dinner. It was their lobster americaine special and quite delicious. Perfectly prepared tender Maine lobster. The roasted vegetables served with it, along with a little potato were also excellently prepared. Enjoyed duck confit appetizer and my wife liked her hearts of palm salad. Careful staff attention from James made the experience very nice. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Charlotte is not known for a lot of French restaurants, La Bibliotheque was the last one I remember and always loved. Since then I have searched and with Lumiere have found my new French restaurant love.
I was able to obtain a reservation for six during restaurant week and enjoy an amazing experience and meal with friends.

Upon arriving we were greeted by a sweet hostess who took our coats, not too many restaurants offer that service anymore, nice!  We then were seated at an already preset table for six, which was nice.
Our waiter, James, arrived and offered water while we waited for the rest of our guests to join.  Once all six of us were there we received an amazing amuse, a starter of a pear and apple bisque soup with a cheddar roll, which was still steaming upon my first bite.  This amuse made me excited for the rest of the meal.

I started with the poached lobster appetizer. Amazing poached lobster atop green beans and thinly sliced artichokes.
Onto the entrée. I went with the striped seabass served with asparagus, white onions and a sweet potato gratin.  The striped bass with cooked to perfection with an amazingly crisp skin...how do they do that?? I also was able to taste some of the other items ordered, poin loin chop and short rib, which were also amazing.
Throughout the meal our waiter refilled our water and wine promptly and checked in often.

After our entrees were cleared, dessert arrived.  I chose a cream filled puff pastry, cannot recall the name, but it was light and fluffy and a perfect end to a perfect meal.
Overall, Lumiere is an experience not too be missed.  I look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Tucked into the strip center next to the much whined about Harris Teeter. Entering, there is a very streamlined modern atmosphere with the edge cut by linen tableclothes and comfortable chairs and booths. A glass enclosed kitchen and small bar serve a small dining area full of very satisfied customers. This restaurant has a level of refinement not common for Charlotte. A maitre'd with a French accent keeps everything the way it needs to be at a restaurant of this class. The wait staff is able to describe the dishes. In great detail. My wife started with escargot that had an unusual presentation, essentially baked en masse in a small crock pot lined and topped with pastry and accompanied by a rich, but not very garlicky, sauce. Presentation is a big part of the meals here but is always matched by the flavor. I had an appetizer of anoglotti (or something like that), a small ravioli like pasta with an interesting cheese inside. For second course, my wife had her favorite foie gras which was seared to perfection and served with a housemade bread toast that had almost the consistency of a soufflé. Very good. For entree, I had a rabbit where the leg and thigh was seared in a breadcrumb like coating with several round pieces of succulent rabbit meat filet wrapped in something like ham. My wife had the duck which was phenomenal, it self filled with a foie gras mixture. Desserts were great as well, but not the highlight of the evening. This place is not inexpensive but is worth every penny and is gourmet on an international level."}
{"text":"First visit, the only spot I wanted to try out for Restaurant Week. Thus you can imagine my absolute excitement when I found out they extended the offer AND had a last minute cancellation last night. I was surprised by the location - smack in the middle of a strip mall next to a dry cleaner. But the interior was nice (with the exception of the ladies' room - I joked that they ran out of renovation budget by the time they got to the bathrooms). My friend was already at the table by the time I arrived at 7:30pm for my reservation. 

Overall service was ok - we were promptly greeted by James, who was spread pretty thin among several tables. Besides a longer wait in between our entrees and dessert and an occasional empty water glass, he was attentive and we enjoyed the pace of the meal.
We opted to share a bottle of their red blend special for $30 (much better than paying $10+ for a glass of something else). We were slightly disappointed to find out they ONLY offered the prix fixe menu - thus we were unable to try the octopus or the escargot. Guess I will have to pay a 2nd visit.

The 3-course options offered by their RW menu were legit. I went with the quail on toast, scallops and napoleon. My friend went with the crispy oysters salad, beef duo, and the black cherry creme brulee. We both received the complimentary pieces of cheese gougeres (which were disappointingly dry and bready - I was thinking more a soft cheese bread) and a small espresso glass size of apple & roquefort bisque (very tasty - a good mix of savory and sweet).

Food quality was high. Everything tasted great with good presentation. My quail was cooked perfectly (I would have preferred less sweetness in the complimentary elements - and those brandied cherries took me by surprise!). The salad was tasty (the 3 oysters were pale in taste in comparison to the greens). I enjoyed the crepe that was lining the plate. Entrees were solid - the beef duo was definitely a good portion, but the orange puree was a bit of an acquired taste. My scallops were good, but tiny portion - 2 scallops cut in halves; I prefer my scallops whole. They were cooked well (some may say undercooked but it's fine by me) and I enjoyed the mix of serrano ham, well seasoned potatoes and the caramelized endive. The black berry creme brulee was light yet smooth, with a side of a small hazelnut ice cream that packed a good punch of creaminess. The napoleon was good but creme brulee stole the show.

Overall this was a great experience and tremendous value ($35pp) for Charlotte Restaurant Week. Now I have to come back and try the escargot and the octopus."}
{"text":"Pretty terrible, the waitress was rude and the salmon was over seasoned. 
I would not recommend this to anyone. I have not eaten a meal this bad as far as I can remember. Unless you love the taste of salt then avoid. 
Thanks for the hype and the expense."}
{"text":"Awesome smells when you walk in the door; hostess and waiter were pleasant and service was professional and timely. Nice wine list. My husband ordered a Sazerac; they made it with lemons and served over ice. It was so bitter he couldn't drink it. They made him another with oranges, but again served it over chipped ice, which is not how a true Sazerac is served. Food looked amazing, but mushroom soup, although tasty, was cold. Same with foi gras, which has delicious flavor but was cold and raw in the middle. Main courses would have been great with a little more seasoning, like salt. Chocolate tart for dessert was very good. Overall, this place could be great with some minor changes to the food and beverages."}
{"text":"I was with a group of 7 for our first visit to Lumiere and it was wonderful.  We started out with the escargot, octopus, duck confit, mussels, and the oysters and all appetizers were delicious.  Everyone in our group either had the bouillabaise or the boar with truffle mac n cheese and everyone was very please.  They have a great wine selection and our server was very helpful with recomendations.  We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Oh Lumiere how I love thee, let me count the ways. Don't let the strip mall exterior fool you on this one. It simply doesn't represent properly the atmosphere once you walk through the front doors. The chef is legit talented. Food and drinks are fantastic, but I'm uber impressed each time I go with the level of service. Educated and informed servers really put this spot over the top.  
On a recent visit, our mussel appetizer was delayed slightly, so unprompted, our server brought us a complimentary wine pairing to go with the mussels along with an amuse bouche to tide us over. The seared foie gras appetizer was incredible, and the seafood bouillabaisse had giant pieces of lobster, mussels, clams and shrimp. This definitely isn't the sort of place you go to all the time (I wish!), but if you have a foodie in your life or are looking for a special evening out, Lumiere is on my short list.  
Join their email list!  They send 1 email a week on Monday detailing the specials for Tuesday-Thursday. The seafood bouillabaisse I had was one of the recent specials and came with a glass of Cote du Rhone for $25, which is ridiculously good pricing.  Till next time, Lumiere!"}
{"text":"No way 5 star experience. Y'all are nuts.

5 star service yes. Everybody super, super nice. I'd go back in a heart beat and give them one more try...

Lobster bisque was salty. Nothing jumping out of the bowl fantastic. Just salty. 

Moroccan date salad needed some restraint. Too much date = too cloying sweet.

Wild Mushroom salad good but heavy.  Lot of egg (which was very tasty- could tell these are quality). Lot of bacon, lot of mushroom. I liked the flavors very much but back off a tad, chef .Little goes a long way. 

Sea Bass an epic fail. Over cooked bleh. Why is it I make better seafood at home? 
Also- brown fish on a plate of brown lentil and mushrooms = no color. Just brown.
Dish needs some zest, some freshness, some color. 1.5 star entree .

Step up your game. Charlotte is depending on you...."}
{"text":"I can't wait to return!! Talk about a 5 star, upscale experience and this is your place. I went for restaurant week. Out reservation was at 5:45, however I arrived about 30 minutes early and they went ahead and sat me as I waited for my party to arrive. The Shrimp amuse-bouche was really nice. I used my dinner roll to soak up the remainder of the juice and that made it even better. The pork was super tender and full of flavor. The Mac & Cheese looked like it may be overcooked, however, it was nice and cheesy and paired well with the pork. My Favorite was the dessert. That Apple Galette was delicious!! Nice and flury with the apples sliced thinly and baked into it. And the Hazelnut ice cream was delightful paired with it. I never had Hazelnut Ice Cream before but I am officially sold! I asked for my Ice Cream on the side. They brought it out in a Martini glass. I quickly moved it to my plate. Our waiter was very attentive and shared lots of information with us. We didn't know that they changed their menu every 6 or so weeks but they just made us even more excited to return."}
