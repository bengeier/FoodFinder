{"text":"This is definitely my favourite restaurant in Brampton. It's one of those places that I seem to hear people complain about quite a bit, but based on my experience, I can't understand why. I've been here a bunch of times now, and just went again today for a late birthday dinner with family. I had the special: red heart shaped ravioli with cheese and spinach. I admit.. my mind was made up when I heard \"heart-shaped\" ;) And I was in the mood for pasta and some wine so it worked out. The ravioli was very tasty! And the service was great as always. I love the atmosphere and the relaxing music here. It's always a really pleasant place to spend an evening with family or friends (and would be a great date spot!)"}
{"text":"I'd come here for dinner before and had a great meal but closer to when it first opened. This time, I tried lunch and did not have as wonderful of an experience.

 I ordered the antipasto to start and it was served in a bowl almost as a salad on greens. It had about 3 very small pieces of Italian sausage, 2 thin slices of prosciutto, just grilled zucchini as far as grilled vegetables and was mostly greens. This was not at all a good value for the money or what I expect when I order antipasto.

I ordered the gnocchi a la Trio for my entree which was an item with a description that sounded amazing. However, the sauce was way too thin and the whole meal was fairly bland. Which is especially odd since it was supposed to be a gorgonzola cream sauce, which I expected to be very flavourful.

On another note, the manager/possible owner who was walking around seemed to run the place with an iron fist and simply not be a very nice person. At one point I heard him chew out a chef about how \"When I say something, that's it. There's no discussion.\" Interestingly, he checked in with us mid-meal and was very friendly but his repor with his employees did not put be at ease and I'm less likely to visit a place because of that.

I've rated Trio 3* which is actually pretty generous considering my experience. However, the waiters were very kind and attentive and the dessert was delicious (Tiramisu). That coupled with my original visit mean I'll probably try this place out at least one more time to see if I just caught them on a bad day."}

The menu and the service has definitely improved from what was there.  A wide variety of choices are available including the much welcomed addition of gluten free pasta for those with that nasty allergy.

That being said, I had such high hopes for this place.  It started so well with a great welcome and throughout the night a wonderful host and server. Double duty no doubt on such a rainy, quiet night in the city.

We ordered the special turkey cranberry with a potato croquette and  a dish off the menu-  vegetable fusili and fagioli but with gluten free pasta and a side of chicken.

Unfortunately, the dining experience fell disappointingly short.  The starter salad, misto, was better than most generic salads, real greens as opposed to iceberg lettuce. We both found the dressing to be just olive oil. No taste but a mouth full of greens slathered in oil.  I threw in some of the balsamic that was for the bread into it. Made a world of difference.

Now, the veggie fusili was a dish that she had ordered before and found this time round to also be disappointed by several things.  Under seasoned is a an understatement. A complete absence of flavouring on her dish as well as mine. Second, they ran out of the gluten free pasta and used instead  gluten free spaghetti. I think for the vegetable fusili and fagioli dish that was just not the best pasta for that style of dish. They should have said something before they proceeded creating that dish.  Third, although the server did apologize, he forgot our  chicken for the dish. The turkey special was overcooked and under seasoned."}
{"text":"When this place  first opened, it was my favourite restaurant full stop. I had emotional moments with their soup of the day. The wait staff and owners were passionate and caring. The food was unbelievable.

I'll never forget the way the steam hit my nose when I first cut into my escargot cottage pie. The twinkle in my eye as I admired the shine on my rack of lamb.

That's all gone now. The stress and uncertainty of owning your own place has done this family in. The food has slid down to a level I cannot accept. The owners wife (who I had not met before) seats guests withe charm of a donkey with allergies. 

I'll miss you Trio. I'll cherish the memory of what you once were."}
