{"text":"Super nice people own this Mecca for Middle East in the SE, service was awesome. Great Fatoush with added sharma, nice fresh pitas. Sharma Poutine was a nice touch. All toppings & sauces for wraps were fresh & flavourful. Desserts were awesome. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Seriously... this place is absolutely amazing!! The food is fresh and delicious and the Family (?) who run it are super friendly and aim to please with big, honest smiles. You can feel their great pride in their menu and their establishment (as it's always sparkling clean). I believe you can always tell how good an ethnic restaurant is by how many people of that ethnicity eat there. My wife & I have been there 3 times now and every time (different times of day too) there are Middle Eastern people coming in. The Falafel Poutine is truly to die for and my wife loves the Tabouleh!  I would recommend this place to anyone and everyone! Mmmmm..."}
{"text":"Stop what you are doing. Drive to Beirut. Get the Beef Shawarma Poutine. You're welcome."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow. Fresh made pitas are on the grill as you come in the door and are made daily. The coal grills have the meats spinning and your mouth will start to water. All the items are made fresh daily. Possible the best shawarma I have ever had. Great selections of desserts to accompany a stellar menu. Worth a small detour off McLeod. The staff are super friendly and truly care what they are feeding you."}
{"text":"Is there a word that's better the awesome? Well if it exists this place is definitely that. Marinated slow roasted over charcoal chicken and beef that is mind blowing. I had the mixed platter (chicken & beef) and I was amazed. Food was flavor packed and the portion was HUGE. Price was more then fair for the quality, and the staff (I assume the owners) were friendly and helpful. My wife and I both had platters and a few iced tea's and with a tip it was just under $40.00. Can't beat that. I highly recommend this place. Its spotless from top to bottom and you can really see the owners take pride in the art."}
{"text":"I ordered a regular beef & chicken mix, my girlfriend ordered the falafel platter. They were both very delicious and generous sized portions. I am 100% going back."}
{"text":"Had dinner here yesterday. Excellent shawarma! The meats are cooked over open charcoal flames which adds a delicious flavour to the meat. The young lady serving us was very helpful and did an excellent job preparing our food. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Decided to try Beirut after reading many reviews on it, and can only conclude that it's close to the top of the shawarma houses in the city. Most certainly I'm sick of being hyped up by high-level reviews and then being disappointed over and over again...

But at Beirut, it's different. Not only is the older woman at the front busy making fresh pitas, but upon talking to one of the servers, I was told that the owner tries to make the very best street food she can. As seems true of back home, she's therefore very exacting in the ingredients and combinations.
Other patrons said that they repeatedly come here for their pockets and full platters, which are, by the way, all large portions even when one asks for the small size.
Instead of roasting over a heat element or gas flame, just as back home they use charcoal to create a steady glowing heat.

The beef shawarma.
Fairly juicy morsels of beef mixed with hummus and all the other ingredients made for a best experience.
The fresh pocket was obviously fresh even though not right off the hot plate.
The aftertaste that lasted for about 2 hours was certainly good.

I will return to check out the chicken and beef platters, and try the donaire to see if it stacks up with others I've had.

If a first time goer, I suggest making the trip.
If not, then your returning footsteps will also tell the story..."}
{"text":"Not your typical donair shop.. this place is a local gem. Ordered the chicken shawarma and beef platter. Both were delicious, fresh, and a generous portion. The pita was the best we have had - made fresh in house! Fatoush salad was also very tasty and all the veggies were so fresh. The seasoning and sauce on the fries were also unique and delicious. 

The owner was very sweet. Definitely will be back when we come back to Calgary."}
{"text":"Such a nice change in comparison to the usual slightly warm, slightly fresh donair places in the area. The meat is made fresh and seasoned well, they roast it over coal and you can see that when you walk in. Homemade toppings and sauces really makes the difference. I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Winner! My favourite place in Calgary for a shawarma! This place is different from all the rest. The pita is made fresh, right before you eat it. Because the pita is grilled after it is assembled, the bread is both chewy and crispy. Eating a shawarma with a freshly made pita makes a world of difference. 

I ordered a beef shawarma but it turned out to be chicken. Doesn't matter - I like chicken too. Both meats are cooked over charcoal. You could see the juices splatter and spit over all the coals. 

The toppings are five stars! What a selection! Everything was fresh and nicely minced or chopped. Vegetables were bright in colour and each had its distinct flavour, unlike some places where all the vegetables seem to taste like each other. The portion was large and even though my wrap was dripping with the sauces (hummus and tahini), I felt it was healthy. 

The female owner is very nice and you can tell she cares about the quality of food that goes out. Pretty busy place. Lots of families and couples coming in for lunch. 

Next time I will get a platter with the sauce on the side, so I can taste the meat on its own."}
{"text":"Just tried it today. Their Shawarma is a Refined version of other options in YYC. The fresh pita is the best touch. To be honest, with garlic sauce and veg and tahini and cheese I found it hard to taste the effect of the charcoal on the shawarma beef. Would have rated it 5 if the large price of $14 was large-and-in-charge like some other establishments. It was filling nonetheless. The Baklava is PERFECT. Made in house? Probably. Not too gooey or sweet. 
If I lived in the area this place would be my go-to."}
{"text":"100% legit. You will not be disappointed when you eat here! Everything is delicious. Home made bread. Chicken and beef slowly grilled over coals. Donair recipe is made from scratch. The MIDDLE EAST beast is my favourite dish. Shawarma poutine..sooo good.

Congrats on getting it right guys!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised! A unique take on middle eastern cuisine that isn't just your average shawarma spot. Had the shawarma poutine and a chicken plate. The fries were awesome and food tasted great!"}
{"text":"If you haven't figured it out from the name, this place has Lebanese food (shwarma, falafel ect.). I've heard it's the only place in Calgary to slow roast their meats over charcoal... and the result is delicious! 

The space is simple, clean and open with a few tables so eating in is comfortable. They have a fridge of drinks and you order, pay, and collect at the front. The grilling meat is visible through glass, which is great on a hot day since you're protected from the heat of the coals. The staff are very friendly (it seems to be a family run business) and the portions are large.

I ordered a chicken shwarma since they also make their own pita. Garlic, hummus, tomato, banana peppers, pickles, lettuce, pickled cabbage, parsley... I even added olives coz I love them! They wrap it, grill it in a panini press, and then add the tzatziki and hot sauce. For a regular size, it was very large... I didn't think I'd be able to finish.... but I did coz it rocked  The chicken was juicy and very well spiced - the charcoal added a great flavour. The other thing that made it so good was the home made pita which made such a huge difference to the texture of a bite! Along with all the other sauces and veggies, I had no problems finishing it off. 

I was so full after I thought.... how am I going to be productive this afternoon??? But once I digested a bit, I didn't feel sluggish at all.... I think perhaps because it really wasn't greasy like I find it is at a lot of other places. 

11 something after tax for a regular size. They also have poutines, platters and salads if you're not feeling the shwarma. Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"My search for the most unique and tasty shawarma is finally over. Here at Beirut Street Food, they serve a shawarma made with fresh ingredient, fresh bread, and meat from a horizontal spit cooked with charcoal.

Arriving here for dinner was totally unexpected. I was hungry for shawarma and I found out that this restaurant was near my workplace. So once I'm off work. I drove to Beirut Street Food hoping to grab a to-go order and head to the gym.

Once I step inside. First thing I can smell was meat roasted using charcoal. Seriously? And importantly, it's on a horizontal spit. This is the first time seeing it live other than on TV food show.

I ordered a mixed shawarma and owner Ramzal was very nice, friendly and generous. I have changed my mind and order for to-stay. I have to take a bite right away!

Now, let's get started with the food. I took my first bite of the shawarma, and WOW! Not only the flavour is there, but what makes it unique is the way they cook the meat in charcoal fire. It gives a distinct caramel and charred flavour to the meat. Also, the pita bread is made in-house. The softness of the pita bread and the freshness of the ingredients. It all goes perfect match!

I also have a side of tabouli salad which is very simple, yet flavourful! A hint of lemon, the sweetness from the tomato and onion, and the parsley. All mixed together with a bit of olive oil. How healthy can it get?!

I really thank you for the surprise dinner. You made my day and I will for sure return for more fantastic foods. Specifically the Kanafi, which was sold out at the time I was there. THANK YOU!"}
