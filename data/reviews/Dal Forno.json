{"text":"Del Forno is AMAZING! The atmosphere is really nice and looks like it would be fun in the evening. Our waitress was super sweet and hilarious! While we were waiting for our food the chef sent out a little appetizer for us to try. It was dough with nuts, cheese, and honey- sounds weird, but tasted soooo good!! We got a margarita pizza which was superb. The chef included fresh parmesan with it and it was a great addition. Our food was so good that we talked to the chef personally to thank him! I wish I could give more than 5 stars! We'll be regulars for years to come!"}
{"text":"Good but not great pizza; great atmosphere, very good service.  We've visited multiple times and have tried most of the menu.  Wood-fired pizza is widely available in the area now and the only thing that really distinguishes the Dal Forno offerings are the higher prices.  That being said, the open area bar is unique and trendy and is worth a first or an occasional visit, but there are better options for wood-fired pizza lovers."}
{"text":"Went to Dal Forno for the first time.   Nice atmosphere.  Large beer list. Pizza was great.  Didn't have an appetizer but everything that past my table looked great.  Service was good too.  A little expensive but their food is good, so worth it."}
{"text":"One of best pizzas ever!  Worth price...beers overpriced...happy hour basically useless...random pizza and random beer discounted so can't really \"plan ahead\"....but pizza excellent....3-4 times a year type of place..."}
{"text":"Great pizza place. This is the type of restaurant that is typically found downtown Pittsburgh. We had the pork wings which had a smokey sweet BBQ sauce. They were amazing. The pizza was around 12 inches and was about medium/thin thickness. It is pricey and I highly recommend going during happy hour to save some money. Which reminds me, the beer selection was eclectic and I enjoyed some beers that I wasn't familiar with. Absolutely recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Headed here on a Saturday night with some friends.  Party-like and rustic atmosphere with a big bar area. We waited about 20 minutes for a table and it was so worth it!  We had the tossed salad served in a bread bowl and the asparagus appetizer.  The salad was enough for the four of us to share and the asparagus was delicious.  Next, we ordered the spinach, cauliflower and prosciutto pizzas.  Each of these us had our favorite.  Mine was the cauliflower but I have to say, they were all spectacular!  Go here.   You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I cannot recommend Dal Forno enough, the pizza is fantastic. If you're getting pizza in the area, this the place to get it. There are some pre selected choices, or you can choose the toppings yourself. It only comes in one size as well, and It should serve 2 or 3 people, depending on how hungry you are. The bar has a very nice craft beer selection, and the seating and feel of the restaurant is very relaxed. A little pricey, but I think it is very worth it."}
{"text":"The restaurant has a cool architecture vibe with exposed brick and rafters.  The beer choices are extensive, and during happy hour, a reasonably good deal.  The pizza is good; service is OK.  The dining room can get busy so there can be a bit of wait."}
{"text":"Have not had a bad pie here. Crust is that perfect crispy charred brick oven style, toppings are done just right, sauce amount is perfect. A little pricey compared to other places, but it's because of the high quality ingredients and work they put into each pizza. Worth every penny.  Relaxed atmosphere. Good beers ... okay I want to go right now."}
{"text":"Loved my first visit! Don't be afraid of the location. It's in the back of a business plaza. Once you pull around back you will see the big sign. Plenty of parking.   My friend and I arrived around 6:45 and were seated right away even though the place looked super busy. The entire staff was super nice and helpful with recommendations. They did let us know they had a large party tonight and apologized if our orders were delayed. Everything came in with perfect timing!   Right away you start with marinaded olives. We ordered the small salad to split. It's huge and only $5! Plenty for two people along with other food. For appetizers we had the stuff peppers. They say it's $13 for two peppers but our bowl was filled. I think we lucked out and got one extra - no complaints from me! The peppers are delicious and are mild in my opinion (To me that's a good thing). Then we had the margarita pizza - super good! I highly recommend it. This was more than enough food for two people. We had left overs to take home.   If you are looking for something different in the Greensburg/Irwin area this is your place."}
{"text":"Once again this family has out done their self. They have the pizza then a whiskey and cigar bar. If you haven't tried one of their restaurants here you have to. Hidden jen in Nht."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Amazing too think this is in north huntingdon! Amazing food, great beer selection, and amazing staff. A little pricey, but worth every damn penny!"}
{"text":"We tried the Prosciutto & Arugula (DOP Tom, Prosciutto, Arugula, Buffalo Mozzarella & Stracciatella) and the Spinach (Saut√©ed Spinach, Mozzarella, Mushrooms & Herbed Ricotta) pizzas and both were delicious.  Great crust and topping combinations."}
{"text":"Good fresh food in an industrial setting (loud acoustics). Pizza is amazing and so is the spicy Mac n cheese.  Two things that I don't like: 1 the drink prices are too high.  (Two glasses of average wine shouldn't cost more than one of the pizza entrees.) And 2. they charge $9 for 4 slices of garlic bread and $14 for three medium sized meatballs, which seems a little excessive for what you get.  Maybe if they charged a little less for drinks and apps, they might sell more. The cigar room is good but the ventilation isn't. You can smell cigars sitting outside the room so that's not too good when you're tying to enjoy a nice meal. I've eaten here several times and will likely be back, I only wish they were a little more reasonable around the drink and appetizer prices."}
{"text":"Nice environment and great food. Had the Brussel sprouts and pizza, both were fantastic! Look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Was at Quinn Brewing next door and decided to go over to get a take out pizza because so many other people JUST got back from doing the same thing (literally within 5-10 minutes) Showed up at 9:31 when their website said they are open until 10:30 only to be told they shut down at 9:30 because they were slow...... 1 minute earlier... and they couldn't make 1 more pizza.... so annoying. I get cutting staff when you're slow but don't be rude to paying customers who come in during business hours.   Moral of the story.. apparently you should call in advanced if you are within 1 hour of closing time ugh"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Dal Forno. I love Cenacolo and wanted to give the pizza place a try. Tucked away inconspicuously in Banco Park industrial plaza, Dal Forno might be my new fav place to get a pie. The pizza was amazing. We had the Bianca and the Lamb. The food arrived quickly with a smile. The Brussel sprouts were a great start to the meal and the craft beer selection is solid. For gourmet pizza, the price was perfect for the quality and portion size. The open floor plan and decor of this family owned pizza joint added to the experience. Oh, and if you go, you have to check out the cigar and bourbon room. This place has it all going on."}
{"text":"Amazing pizzas and the whiskey room is amazing!  Great family owned business and you can tell that they truly care about their customers!    We always get the cheese bread, salad and one of their pizzas and it's enough to fill up 4 people!"}
{"text":"Pizzas in this place are good. But for the price on the menu you can go to better places. The device is not good. Paper rolls to ideas napkins??? When I go out and I pay that price for pizza I expect something better. Will not go back."}
{"text":"Cool space with excellent pizza. We also loved the stuffed peppers and pork wings!  Service was weird. They kept seating other people before us, then we didn't have a server for a good 15 minutes. Front of house was really not great. Good food, though!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable. I mean this pizza was fantastic!! Loved it, so fresh, perfect! The salad was delicious too! We got a margharita pizza & the house salad, which comes with a raspberry vinaigrette. I loved everything about that meal & can't wait to go there again! They bring you a bowl of olives before you're meal just like next door at Cenacolo. I could've had. I thing else & been happy. I don't know what kind of love they put into their food but you feel it when you eat there! Do yourself a favor & go!"}
{"text":"We finally made it here to try the pizzas we heard so much about. Since it was just my husband and I , we split a Mixed Salad and a Margarita Pizza. He also ordered a Strawberry milkshake. Let's start with that one. It was really fabulous. Real strawberries and cream and cherries on top. A five star milkshake.  Next , the salad. Also a five star salad. Mixed greens with grape tomatoes, red onion and shavings of a good Parmesan cheese with just the right amount of dressing. As a bonus , I added some of the complimentary olives that were delivered to our table almost immediately after sitting down.  Now the pizza. We've eaten a lot of Margarita pizzas over the years. We have a gold standard that we compare all to, made by our friend Billy, served at Ianni's in New Derry. This one wasn't quite as good.  The crust was excellent. Perfect in fact. But the toppings were off. Not enough basil , and the addition of either a Parmesan or Romano cheese to the mozzarella didn't work for us. Still, we thought we will need to come back and try some other toppings. Perhaps a White Pizza with sausage or another Specialty Pizza off the menu.  Service was excellent, atmosphere was good, industrial vibe carried out well. The place was very clean. All in all a very enjoyable visit, just a bit disappointed after all the hype we had heard."}
{"text":"First thought, it isn't easy to find the first time... it is to the left, in a business park behind the post office. Second thought, damn good pizza and worth finding!  I tried the lamb and rosemary pizza, with roasted peppers etc, it was awesome. It was also a tough choice, all of them looked good. I loved the garlic infused olive oil for dipping the crust. It is what that crap that comes with delivery pizzas tries to be.  It is a huge open space inside, kind of odd decor, but the people working were helpful and friendly. They are only open in the evenings. Sure it costs a little more than delivery, but they do make a great pie!"}
{"text":"Love to come here. Pizza is great. I'm in love with their cigar bar. I don't smoke but they have bourbon there to die for. My favorite the chocolate bourbon. Nice to go there have a sandwich or pizza (it's all good) and then head to cigar bar for relaxation and a chocolate bourbon dessert"}
{"text":"Two separate areas:  The bar and the dining area.  First the bar:  Blue Moon without an orange slice and a Dark and Stormy Mule with no lime.  When it's a full bar charging top price that is not ok.  The bar is crazy loud and very well manned.  Second the dining area:  We were in a little back area that led to the cigar lounge.  We were right beside a huge, heavy door that patrons banged constantly.  It was not ideal, but not awful.  Our server was very upbeat and knowledgeable about the menu - the menu is not extensive, but there is something for everyone with the star of the show, of course, their gourmet pizza.  The chef sent a little tidbit of spicy chorizo - so tasty.  Then we started with a salad, which is big enough for 2 or three people and served on a crust.  Very unique and very flavorful.  The pizzas are to die for.  No exaggeration - the spicy meat pizza is the best I've ever had (and I'm kinda old and eaten a lotta pizza!)  Parking is a drag, but the food is more than worth trolling the crowded lot for the next spot available.  Go. Eat. Pizza.  Did I forget to mention the yummy little shot of frozen sangria that comes with the check?"}
{"text":"We have been eagerly awaiting this pizza since hearing about it during dinner at Cenacolo. The pizza was absolutely delicious. We tried the margarita, a plain cheese and mushroom. Everything was very flavorful and the pizzas were larger than we anticipated. I hope they add a dessert menu and wish they were closer. We can't wait to go back and try the items on their updated menu."}
{"text":"Truly amazing pizza and such a great environment. Brilliant idea to turn this industrial sites into unbelievable restaurants. I can't wait to go back. The flavors are off the charts and the staff is great too."}
{"text":"We loved every bite. Started with the mozzarella stuffed meatballs in marinara and in a white mushroom truffle sauce. There were ten in our party. We ordered about 5 different pizzas and shared. My favorite was the cauliflower with caramelized onions and fried leeks. The service was great the food was delicious."}
{"text":"We made about the half hour trip to Del Forno on (our) friday pizza night and we were very impressed!  We have been to Cenacolo and had a great experience there as well.  We started next door with a couple pints from Quinn Brewery before heading over for our pizza.  The place is certainly not much to drive up to and you wonder if you are in the right place but the inside is really neat.  Del Forno had a great beer list to choose from which made us craft beer lovers happy.  We were seated nearby the ovens so we could see how big the pizza was before ordering.  They also had a band playing over on the bar side which we thought was pretty good!  Our waiter was very personable and we enjoyed our service.  The chef sent over a crostini appetizer before our pizza that was delicious and hopefully will be on the menu in the future.  We got the Meat & Spice pizza and it was amazzzing! Totally worth the price in our opinion.  We even had leftovers since it was just the two of us sharing one pie.  The frozen sangria shot sent over with our check was a delicious ending!  We had a great experience here and will certainly make the trip back!"}
