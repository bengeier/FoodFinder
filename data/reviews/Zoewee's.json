{"text":"Food is awesome please try the potatoe leaf one con I didn't like was when the gentleman seen myself and my gf standing up he insisted that we must sit down"}
{"text":"Awesome Food! A group of our office randomly decided to stop by this place today. Don't let the simple dining room fool you... The food is complex and is definitely home made 100%! I've never had Liberian food, but wow, they do it right! The guy who sat us, understood that we didn't have a clue what to order so he brought us a free little sampler of some of their dishes. After a few bites I knew exactly what to get! Potato Greens with Rice! 

They definitely work at a slower pace there so don't expect a 20 minute lunch... Plan on being there for at least an hour... 5 Stars!"}
{"text":"This is authentic Liberian food, I recommend the cassava leaf if it is available. The restaurant is basic but the food is good and spicy if you need it to be, ask for extra pepper."}
{"text":"If you've ever had the opportunity to travel and enjoy Africa, the wait time will not raise an eyebrow. Service is culturally appropriate and the food is well worth the wait, so chill out fast food craved foodies. The food is presented clean and simple. Servings are gigantic and can easily feed 2 adults. Be sure to sample the plantains, jollof rice and okra stew-- however, everything I've tasted thus far has made my tummy very happy."}
{"text":"The food was great and they serve you plenty!!! You actually get what you pay for!!! The decor...uhmmm Idk if its just me but I like going to resturants that have life, the decor was dry it didn't feel \"African\" maybe the owner could put some art on the wall, put a touch of Africa in this place!!! Overall great service and food!!!;"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this please for a few years, I'm sad to report that I am highly disappointed. I ordered fried croaker with seasoned rice with a side order of chicken wings. They obviously used super old oil to fry my items because the odor that filled my car and my house...was nauseating. The rice was okay, but the chicken and the fish were both unseasoned and hella funky due to the old oil bath. 

I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I had their Pepper soup, fried fish and plantains.  It was just sitting in oil as if they never drained the oil out.  It was enough oil to fry another fish, oil my whole body including my hair.  I dont think Inwill be going back anytime soon.  My husband is from West Africa and he was even dissappointed."}
{"text":"I am a frequent customer here at Zowees.  I used to come weekly however, lately it just doesn't seem to be a great value.  The food generally taste well.  I have ordered, Potato Greens, Casava Leaf, Fish/plantains, Fish Gravy and seasoned rice(which is exceptional). No pork in any of their dishes.  I just feel like if you compare their prices to other ethnic spots in town you really aren't getting your money's worth. Barely any meat and possibly the smallest foil containers around. There are a few African restaurants popping up so they may start to feel the competition."}
{"text":"Love love love some good good cassava leaf! I recommend this restaurant to anyone, my best friend introduced me to zowees and said they had jelluf rice and many other things so I had to go back and try it again! There wasn't a line and the score was 90 which I don't understand why because the restaurant was clean as hell! Go and try them they're delicious!!"}
{"text":"Another of my favorite restaurants in charlotte. This food is up there with any fancy uptown dining establishment but they keep the food affordable due to low overhead. If you go to restaurants just for amazing food and don't like paying an extra 15 dollars to your bill to subsidize the location then this place is for you!"}
{"text":"I love everything about this place. The music in the background is nice, the people are nice, and the food is EXCELLENT! If you're not too familiar with African food, try the potatoe greens with corned beef rice, or the fish and plantains. Sooooo good! They're pepper soup is good too."}
{"text":"The food has never been a miss. The potato greens and fried whole croaker being my favorite dish. The Pepper soup with Fufu, is a blessing on a cold day. My family has sampled most everything on the menu without complaint. So why the three stars? The customer service is non existent. I usually dine in and there has never been a time where I haven't witnessed someone complain about the service. My mother and I visited yesterday waited for our food for a good 30 minutes, which is fine because it comes out hot and fresh, this is not a fast food restaurant so that is to be expected no complaints there. Our came out without two items. My mom knows the ropes when visiting so she placed the fish order twice. No fish. 

The waitress who is usually on call moves at a snails pace. It is actually astonishing to sit and experience how she moves about. I watched her clean a table (2 minutes) ask us if we needed anything, take someones order who was irritated by the lack of service, clean another table (5 mins) before putting in the order for the irritated man. I wanted to stay and observe if she got his order right but had to leave. Bottom line, the food is good the customer service is HORRIBLE and I don't think they are going to change that because we keep coming back. My family and I are looking for another location to patronize based only on the lack of customer service we have experienced and seen others experience."}
{"text":"As a Liberian and a chef I'm very picky about Liberian food. This place did not let me down. I had the fufu & soup and tried some of the palava sauce & rice my mom ordered. Both were great! I gave it 4 stars because the service is VERY slow. I know what goes into cooking Liberian food and I know how a restaurant kitchen works and there's no excuse for all the lag time. Every one is very nice though. Definitely recommend and I'll be back the next time I'm in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Went for a bookclub meeting to discuss a book based on an African family...have been back monthly for Cassava Stew with Rice and Fried Fish.  So much flavor."}
{"text":"Don't go here expecting anything for atmosphere.  There isn't any. You're here for good cheap food.  

Great flavor combinations.  Flavors that I haven't had anywhere else in Charlotte.  I'd come back for sure to try some other dishes."}
{"text":"Zoewee's has the best food I've had in a long time!! The food is always fresh and the portions are plentiful. I'm not big on spicy foods, but the seasonings are always on point here! I don't know what I'm going to do when I move and can't get to this place!! I do know that Zoewee's will be at the top of my list of thing to do when I visit the QC!!"}
{"text":"I had an interesting meal here yesterday- it is a West African restaurant specializing in Liberian food. I had the potato greens on rice, fufu, and palaver sauce. The potato greens were a pungent greens stew with palm oil, chicken, beef and turkey. The food was rich, spicy (but not hot) and flavorful. Everyone in the restaurant when I was there was from Liberia. It has a very basic interior and it is in a strip mall which is kind of set back from the road, so it was not the easiest place to find. The waiter brought me a couple of samples to try before I ordered. It is not far from the Asian Corners mall."}
