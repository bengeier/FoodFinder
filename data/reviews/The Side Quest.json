{"text":"Order a zissou adventure with the gummy shark. Absolutely disgusting. Disappointed. The bartender is making me something new now. We shall see....."}
{"text":"Good place to goto with friends if you like board games, costs a buck to play as many as you want all night"}
{"text":"Tremendous drink selection, friendly staff, and a unique atmosphere with people playing board and card games all over the place."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here a couple of times.  It's a \"gamer bar\" that has a lot of board games for rent, some special events like Trivia Night, TVs showing stuff like Adult Swim and Big Bang Theory, and Game of Thrones taps on the bar.  All these things are nice but I'm not a huge fan of any of them.  I go here mainly because the beer selection is awetastic and unlike some of the other \"beer geek\" bars in the area, this place is (a) not as crowded and (b) definitely not a \"sports bar\".  With the Browns having such a terrible season, I'd just as soon watch \"Bob's Burgers\" while I drink my very good (and decently priced) beer.  The tenders are friendly, the atmosphere is comfortable, and because this is kind of at the end of where the downtown stops, the parking is relatively easy to find. Minus one star because they do not serve food, which I find rather essential when drinking 10 percent imports, but you can bring in your own (and the Rush Inn which is about 100 feet away has some great sandwiches and burgers)."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. I went to a quiz night with a team of my friends and the bar was full and closed for entry an hour before the quiz started. Which is fine.
We asked the bouncer what time we should come back for the second event and she had no idea.
But then we watched the same bouncer let in three random new girls behind us in line to join a team of 2 already inside. When I approached Side Quest and voiced my concerns they responded by calling me a liar over social media. You lost 6 clients. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"I really like this place; the small plates are tasty and fairly priced. I love being able to enjoy a beer without having to watch sports on 10 screens!  Being able to play board/card games is simply amazing. 

However, I do not love showing up to hear that the kitchen is closed. I enjoyed it less when it occurred a second time.

Great place if the kitchen is open."}
{"text":"Despite living a good 20-30 minutes away, Side Quest is what I consider my \"usual\" bar. My friends and I go about once a month- sometimes more, sometimes less, and pretty much every time we have a good time. I love the themed events, love the staff, love the drinks. Wish there was more room to sit sometimes, but I will never fault an establishment for being busy ;) Love Side Quest, will be going back soon."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I have always wanted to try this place, because they are HUGE in the geek community. I was here today with the girls from Geek Girl Brunch Cleveland. It is my understanding that they have been wanting our group to brunch with them for over year. They said they could handle a party of 30. Sadly, that was not the case. 
1) It was very loud in there. They had a DJ spinning records there for other patrons, but we could barely hear ourselves talk. 
2) They didn't know what they were doing. When we got there, a third of our members went to the bar to 'place their order' or 'tell them what they want to order', and then pay for it. 
Then, we were told to sit down, then they would take our orders. (Um, we sent an order to them them 10 days in advance.) And, in my case, I was asked what my order was. Some members didn't get their order, some waited 2 hours for their order, and some got the wrong order. 
3) Rude! I asked for a second diet coke,and the person who dropped off my food said to take it up with the bartender. 
4) Afterwards, I heard that they complained that we didn't tip well (see #2 above) and they were not expecting us to come in all at once. If you had people paying at various times, and didn't keep track of what was going on, NO. I know I tipped, as did a number of other girls that were there. As for the comment that they didn't know we were coming in all at once, we told them it was brunch event for our group. 
I understand the kitchen is a new concept for them. And, the owners were out of town. But, after they complained to someone about us...would we go back? I know a lot of our members participate in their theme nights / events. But, as for me...no. I am good. My best experience, aside from hanging out with friends there, were the apricot bellini's I had."}
{"text":"Fun place with a ton of games to chose from and great drinks. It's just really hard to get served here if you're not a regular."}
{"text":"Visited on a Saturday night, and was surprised at how crowded this place was.  They could use a little more space around the game shelves.  I didn't feel comfortable browsing without bumping into people seated nearby.  The bartender was very nice and the service was great when we could get her attention.  

I would come again, but I think for games I preferred my visit to Tabletop."}
{"text":"A group of my friends come here every Thursday night for Trivia night (I join when I can) and this is how I found out about this place. The bartenders are awesome and the beer selection is stellar! Whether you want a draft or bottle they have a great selection. They also have a good selection of whiskey and make creative, tasty mixed drinks, They don't serve food but you are able to bring food with you.

They have tons of events always going on and a large amount of board games to choose from. Come check out trivia night, It gets packed, the trivia master is awesome and someone will always shout something that will make you laugh."}
{"text":"There are sports bars, there are gay bars, and now we have nerd bars! Yup, a comfy place my nerdy brethren and I can drink and talk about nerdy things without getting a wedgie. Hubby and I go there monthly for the book club (first Tuesday of every month at 7pm - join us!), but we've also been there for Doctor Who premiers, Halloween parties, Bars Against Humanity (where the ENTIRE BAR plays Cards Against Humanity), a trivia night AND even a wedding and reception for a couple that met at The Side Quest! Sam, the bearded one who runs the place, is a delight and fun to talk to when he's not busy slinging Sonic Screwdrivers or Butter Beers. FYI, they serve food again, so there's no more bringing in outside goodies while you game or chat.  They have poutine on the weekends (GENEROUS helpings of the stuff!) and the rest of the week is pretty typical bar nosh with fun names. AND the ladies room has the best graffiti in Cleveland. No idea what the men's room is like."}
{"text":"The Side Quest is easily my favorite spot in Lakewood. The bartenders are excellent and quirky and delightful. The Minerva's Nightcap is my personal favorite drink and I never miss the fries when the kitchen is open. If you're thinking about tofu wings, go for it! Definitely worth it."}
{"text":"This bar is the place to be on Saturday night. That bartenders are always friendly and very attentive. Pairs greatly with 16-bit down the road you can get the best of both worlds of gaming. Side Quests table top games are only $1 per person and all of your favorite shows on the tvs."}
{"text":"Some friends and I went here for Trivia (Geeks who Drink) the other night and I felt right at home. Trivia was a Blast and they have plenty of other themed events throughout the week.

While the establishment is small it doesn't feel cramped it felt rather welcoming. The staff was friendly and chill, and the overall vibe was very relaxed. For being a smaller place they have a pretty decent beer selection. I was excited to find a favorite beer from Pittsburgh's Church Brew Works!

As a board game lover the have a whole wall of game that you can play from dominion to mad gab. I mean whats better than a drink and games with friends.  Simply choose your game and ask the bartender for the pieces located behind the bar. They do ask for a $1 fee per player to ensure there are no shenanigans. 

Unfortunately, if you tummy starts to grumble while you plan your next move, sorry but no dice. It appears that this place do not serve food at the moment. While they think that 50 cent bags of chip will fill your appetite, I believe that I can strategize better on a full tummy.

However, there is a pretty good chance that they allow outside food as I saw  pizza delivery boy wandering around. 

All in all if you're looking for a non judgmental environmental to grab a drink and have fun with friends whether you're into Dungeons and Dragons or Dictionary there is something fun for everyone."}
{"text":"I love that this place exists, and I wish there were many more places like it. The only thing I don't like about it is that it's so hard to find a seat. It's always packed. There's so much pent up demand for a good bar for literate intellectual people who enjoy science fiction and board games."}
{"text":"This place is everything I've ever wanted in a bar! Board games, awesome (virgin and non virgin) drinks and FRIENDLY bar tenders! I went for my first time Friday night and it wasn't even crowded which was great. The bartenders were so sweet and accommodating which is very hard to find. The first years butter beer was the most delicious thing I've ever tasted and the vast amount of board games to play was impressive. I can't wait to come back and become a regular.  
*The only thing I'd change is the fact that it was freeeeezing in there. So come prepared with hoodies and lots of layers."}
{"text":"A few friends and I came to Side Quest last night for drinks and games. I had heard great things about the place and have been to Table Top, a similar board game bar, before and I really enjoyed it. I was excited to try this place out. 


We came in and were all given menus. Unlike Table Top, this place is 21+ only so you are carded upon entry. My friends and I found a place to sit and looked over the menu.


All of the drinks and food had really clever names. I tried out a few of their special cocktails and really enjoyed the Minerva's Nightcap. Most of my drinks were delicious. I was surprised at the service quality though. It was not too busy and was a Tuesday night, yet it always seemed to take awhile to get one of the bartender's attention. In addition to this, the food menu seemed highly lacking. Nothing really looked appetizing so I wouldn't really come here for anything other than drinks. I don't think I saw a single person in the place eating anything. The idea of staying and playing for hours is kind of ruined if there are no really good food/snack options. 

The game set up is confusing as well - board game pieces are kept behind the counter. Every other board game bar I've been to has just charged a fee and let you pick out unlimited games. I believe they charge you per game here.

All in all, I prefer Table Top and would rather drive the further distance to go there. Side Quest does have a few pros: the cocktails are clever and delicious and I love the idea of the themed nights. I also enjoyed the ambience and crowd. In my opinion, though, the service was lacking on a Tuesday so I couldn't imagine how it would be on a weekend. I also think that Table Top has tastier food selections and a more helpful staff/set up in general. 

In the end I may return here for a late night drink and quick game!"}
{"text":"Nice idea and setting and drinks are a good value, but don't order the food. We had multiple orders in our party and they all came out cold after we asked about them. The staff are indifferent and the food sort of tasteless. Eat somewhere else before or after and skip the aggravation."}
{"text":"LOVE The Side Quest! This bar might not be the right vibe for everyone, but I love it here. The identify themselves as a nerd bar and live up to the name with their fun cocktails, board games, movies and shows on the TVs, decor, and special events. 

I love the friendly and laid back atmosphere at this bar the most. It's a place I can go to hang with friends and have a good time surrounded by other friendly people. The beer and drink selection is also great and they also have fun food offering if you're interested. 

I have also attended one of their special themed events and hope to go to many more! They had great food, amazing special drinks for the event, and creative activities for guests."}
{"text":"Okay...let me start by saying this...
I'm not a fan of bars. 
I'm not a heavy drinker, not a barfly, hell, I'm not even a bar weevil.
What I do like is places with nice folks, nice atmosphere, and that something...extra.

So, it is without reservation that I say that to someone like yours truly, The Side Quest in Lakewood is my version of Cheers...just with more of us nerdy folks, tons of rentable games (the board on the table variety,) drinks named after comic book, movie and television characters, not to mention drinks derived from books that you've only heard of (Harry Potter Butterbeer, anyone?) 

The Side Quest also has a policy that allows you to bring in your own food, so you can stop up the road at any one of a dozen places and get a snack to bring in and have with some of the best drinks in the area. (Oh, and did I mention that the TV's in the bar are usually all playing SOMETHING geeky, like Cartoon Network or Syfy channel?) Yep, it's that kind of place:) 

They also have video game nights with games set up by local patrons, trivia nights that are to geekily die for, and a personal favorite, once a week they have a Cards Against Humanity game night called Bars Against Humanity where the ENTIRE BAR plays this insidious game and people utter phrases that, in most normal circumstances, they would not say EVAR!!

All and all, I have to say, this is MY kind of bar, and if  you love games, nice people around and behind the bar (Hi Katie!) and a place where  you can think over your drink, then adventurers, get off the beaten path, and go to the Side Quest!"}
{"text":"Great fun for nerds and geeks like myself. The drinks are fantastic and there's always an entertaining event taking place every night there. Some nights you cant play the console games though. Other than that the atmosphere is fun and everyone (including the patrons) are very friendly."}
{"text":"Oh my... a Nerdy Bar... where has this been all my life. This place features a full bar with some really fun specialty drinks... I am a fan of the sonic screwdriver and the Deadpool. There are classic sci-fi movies showing on the big screens and tables to play games"}
{"text":"The Side Quest is an awesome place for gamers to sit an relax. Although my husband and I don't drink and serve as the designated drivers, we felt incredibly comfortable there and even took amusement in the geek themed drinks. There is a wide selection of tabletop games to play with something for everyone!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite bars of all time. While I agree from a purely board game fan perspective the Tabletop bar in Ohio City may be better since they have a much larger selection of games and more space. But it doesn't have the same vibe and camadarie as Side Quest. There's just something about this place that just feels more personal, warm, and inviting. And now they serve food which is just icing on the cake. 

They are quickly becoming a vital part of Lakewood."}
{"text":"I attended a private event at this place a while back.  The staff was great.  The beer selection was nice, they had some good looking cocktails for those who like that sort of thing.  They also have a tone of games that one can borrow and play.  What a great concept, everything from fantasy football to Risk. I'll likely be going back."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!  I'm really not a bar person, but I do like boardgames and I am a geek.  They have cleverly named mocktails that go along with the whole geek vibe and several people came in in cosplay.  Everyone was friendly, staff and patrons alike.  I was there on a date and neither of us had been there before, but we agreed that we would definitely be back!  I deducted a star because the food was from a place called Wok and Roll, or something like that, and I really didn't care for it.  They have their own kitchen, though, so I'll try to go on a night when it's open."}
{"text":"Wonderful addition to lakewood. Never have a bad time here.  Fun atmosphere. Very laid back.  Great drinks. Miss the food they had when they first opened."}
{"text":"OMG... While I don't look like the girl that would normally geek out...this place is AWESOME!!! I went there for a couple of singles mixers and it was very low key and ended up making a few new friends. I love that they have a boat load of games (not video) to play and if they don't have it then it's either broke,hard to find or it was never made. I love how they do themes for different nights, if my memory serves me right...they just did Harry Potters Birthday!!! The mixed drinks they make on a daily have been named after different characters in movies and also games."}
{"text":"The best chicken sandwich ever, so juicy and watery, fries are tasty,definitely ordering next time,and everyone at the side quest are awesome, my peeps.i definitely recommend Julia jingle menu is delicious."}
{"text":"The staff here was very friendly to me. I decided to come to Lakewood for the first time and hit up the two \"nerd bars\" in town: 16 Bit and The Side Quest. Of the two, I felt more comfortable here at the Side Quest. They serve some food here, unlike 16 Bit. The crowd is more geeky/nerdy and I didn't feel packed in like a sardine like I did at 16 Bit. It was also slightly less loud (not by a lot, but still a little less.) It is a bit smaller, but it is cozy. I feel like I could make friends easily here, and I foresee this becoming a regular spot for me. The best part, of course, truly was the kind staff. :)"}
{"text":"Best cocktails that I know of. Only got a 4 because is smelled of urin as soon as you opened the door."}
{"text":"Came here to catch up with a few friends. When we sat down, the bar tender just about sprinted over to check our IDs, after that she really wanted nothing to do with us. About a half hour later we figured out that you have to order at the bar. We ordered two salads and a grilled cheese with bacon. One salad and the grilled cheese (without bacon) came out in about 40 minutes. The other salad was ready about a half hour after the first round of food came out. Our whole group really felt judged the second we walked in. If you want a fun game night, save yourself the trouble and head to 16 bit down the street."}
{"text":"Definitely worth it!  They are attentive to food allergies. The breads are not house made (white and canned biscuits ). No other bread types are offered. I had my own simple breakfast with bacon.  It was pretty tasty!    I will definitely visit in the future!"}
{"text":"Ok, I've been here twice now in about 3 years. The concept is awesome, it's a different experience.  The bar tend was friendly, and talkative. They have a dice game for ordering your alcoholic beverage, it's a 20 sided die, you roll and whatever number you get you drink that corresponding drink or if roll 20, you then get to pick randomly. We've done this both times, it's interesting to do if you're not sure what you want...but be careful."}
{"text":"I love this bar. It's a great community of people. Being new to Cleveland this bar definitely helped me make friends with similar nerdy interests as me. The owners have big hearts and truly care about providing a fun and safe environment for everyone. The prices are great and the drinks are amazing! I will always call this my favorite bar in Cleveland."}
{"text":"This is one of the coolest bars I've been to. Side Quest is a no-judgement no-pressure spot to hang out, enjoy some drinks/food, and play board games. 
The owner (who is there on a regular basis, shout out to Sam!) takes the time to converse with patrons and has a great sense of humor. The bar staff are all very attentive and have some neat creations when it comes to drinks. 
Almost every night there is a theme or event which keeps it entertaining. The $1 unlimited board game plays is a great way to hang out with friends and have fun without breaking the bank or partying excessively. 

Stop by and check Side Quest out! It's not your average bar and definitely the kind of place you go once, get hooked, and become a regular."}
{"text":"My guy and I adore this wonderful watering hole of like minded souls! The amount of passion for sci-fi, geekery and nerdery is celebrated with themes, parties and specialty drinks. Board gaming is a fun way to unwind with a cold beer after work. I loved their Unicorn Hot Chocolate (a winter drink) and of course, for you fellow Potterheads there is Butterbeer! I drag friends and family, and recommend to strangers alike! In addition to the creative cocktails - there is also a unique selection of craft beer, ciders and meads! Side quest has something for everyone! There are also delicious \"noxtails\" (non alcoholic drinks) for your DD or sober friends too! It gets 5 stars here, because I can't give it a 10. Love this place!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for something fun to do during the week I highly suggest coming to The Side Quest and participating in their Geeks Who Drink Trivia on Thursday nights!  I showed up a little early and the staff and fellow customers greeted me with warm and friendly attitudes! They also helped me figure out what the heck I was supposed to do to get in on this trivia action. I sat at the bar and ordered a Butter Beer (if you've read Harry Potter you have to try one!). This concoction was was sweet, but tasty and I enjoyed pretending I was a Muggle. Once my date arrived we played Pictionary and soon started to fret about how terribly bad we were at knowing facts! However, once the trivia started the whole bar was full of laughs and we were not alone with our terrible guesses. We ended up placing 14th out of 15 teams, but that is not last so I call it a win! 

I will definitely be back! Oh and side note: they don't serve food, but you can bring some in with you!"}
{"text":"I love the vibe of this place. While it can be busy on a night when there are organized events, if the event is something you enjoy like trivia, etc., this place is great! Some of the best unique cocktails I've ever had and the Lemony Snicket is one of my top 3 drinks of all time!"}
{"text":"The beer selection is giant and they have dark beers year around. 
The staff of wonderful and the noxtails are Delish, the games are free just finding a  table on the weekend is hard but its such a wonderful atmosphere even sitting on the bar playing games is epic.
Great bar for date night!
Clean and fun to be in! 
The owners are really engaging and welcoming, I do love all their specialty drinks specially butter beer!

I really love the bar that is also welcoming to out lgbtqa community. 
Some times they have special events those rock hard! The food trucks at times are there and is a real good time. They do hold Private parties so inquire on that one."}
{"text":"For those who have not heard of this bar or have not been to it yet, this is a bar for all lovers of board games and competition. 4 of us headed out to Side Quest around 8pm on a Saturday night in October and found a table, no problem (had we gotten there at 9 or 10, we may have been out of luck). We opened a tab at the bar and checked out the place.

As far as size goes, I would say this isn't a super-big bar. Pretty cozy. I liked the ambiance and didn't mind the close quarters--made it feel like game night in someone's (very large) den.

Here comes the cool part--they have TONS of board games to rent, and they continue to build on their current inventory. Instead of listing all of the games, I took a picture. Be sure to check it out. Games, I am pretty sure, are only $1 to rent. And you are always free to bring your own!

The beer selection was not the biggest, but it was nothing to scoff at either. They have 24 craft beers to choose from, some of which were perfectly themed for the bar's geeky style (ommegang game of thrones!). They also have wine and liquor available...perfect for the fireball shots the loser had to buy!

I can't speak to the food, as we did not order any. I also was not the one picking up the bill at the end, so I can't comment on price. All I can comment on is the amazing experience we had here. I am looking forward to coming back on a weeknight when they have trivia and free game play! nights"}
{"text":"Tis a Mecca for geeks with board games, a fantastic craft beer selection and high end spirits at good prices. Bar staff is super friendly. They have an old school video game night once a week which is sweet! I got to brush up on some Golden Eye.  Good times!!!"}
{"text":"Nice chill area to hang with friends and play games. I got the hot chocolate cocktail. I felt the peppermint schnapps made the drink off putting I would suggest just using Irish cream instead"}
{"text":"Great selection of beers, ciders, and other stuff (working through the list, my liver hates me). Board and card games to play while you drink, and great music! Not a sports bar, they have fun stuff if you must watch TV!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite bars of all time! Trivia night can be a little hectic, but it's so much fun and one of my favorite ways to spend a Thursday night. Cocktails are tasty and creative, along with an excellent and extensive tap list. I've been a fan since before the kitchen was open, and adding the Side Quest kitchen has added to the experience! Food is stereotypical pub fare, but yummy! Sunday brunch is even better! If you're looking for a new bar and a good time I highly recommend the Side Quest!"}
{"text":"Met some friends up here the other day and had a pretty good time.  Great beer selection but a tad pricey.  Looks like a cleaned up version of the old Eddie and Iggys but with table and card games for rent.  1.00 per person/game is a good deal I say.  Trivia on Thurdays.  When I got there it had just ended and numb nuts DJ dude had the music so friggin loud my back teeth were hurting.  Crowd is kinda nerdy but its better than the jock/date rape lookin dudes who used to come in here.  All these new places opening up need to get some bartenders that understand they are revenue makers for the business.  There were literally 3 dudes, arms folded talking 3 feet from me while my empty beer can sat on the inside rail of the bar for well over 5 minutes.  Bartending 101.  I just got outa work and I need a damn beer or I might die!"}
{"text":"Skip this place the bartender charged me 18 dollars for a beer a was i kittle drunk si i didnt realize until 30 mins after the fact what a rip off plus just a bunch of dorks go there i will never be back"}
{"text":"Side Quest is a super charming bar that, while targeting a nerd-based clientele, is accessible for those of the non-nerd persuasion. There is a vast draft beer selection and the cocktails are well made (Seriously: the Black Widow is the best). The board game selection is just as vast, with many selections available for whatever size group you have. Trivia on Thursdays (Geeks who Drink) is also a blast and a regular part of my week. I cannot recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I heard about this place where we could drink, play board games and build our own poutine, so we were ultimately all for heading there after work on a Friday night. We order food at the bar, but we were informed that there was no food that night, and I really didn't catch the reason. The bartender was super friendly though, and we decided to stay regardless, play some board games and drink some beer. Other than not being able to order food, it was a good visit overall. I definitely want to go back when there IS food there, as I hear it's worth the drive from downtown Cle to Lakewood."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try Side Quest on our date night after seeing Evil Dead: The Musical. We ordered a bunch of tasty treats off the menu and I got a Butter Beer ( which was alcoholic in this case). The bar atmosphere was pretty low key but it was also a Wednesday night. The food was outstanding ( though I read they got a new menu recently) and the drinks were equally as good. They have a lot of fun nerdy themed things going on, which I love. I follow them on Facebook so I can see all the events. All in all a fun place to go and everything was reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"A really quaint little bar that we discovered for the first time because they were throwing a MST3K themed viewing party. We really enjoyed the space and the atmosphere, the drink specials were priced right, and we had a great time. 

Side Quest does not have a formal menu, but does serve sandwiches (Pit Stop) and brownies   (Fear's Confections). Definitely a bit of an odd approach for a bar of this caliber. The foodie inside of me is definitely bummed out by the lack of a menu, but the frugal part of me does a happy dance because you can bring your own food or order pizza (I'm looking at you, Angelo's!), which totally makes for a fun, cheaper date night.

For the event, the bartenders were serving up some specialty cocktails themed around the series. Our group tried all three being offered; two were delicious, one was pretty undrinkable, but overall I think they did a great job of pulling off themed drinks. We switched to beer thereafter, and they had a decent selection that we were pleased with. The service itself was a little slow (seemed understaffed for the crowd), but very friendly and helpful once they got around to you.

And then of course there are the board games. $1 per player, rental fee waived on Tuesdays. They have all the classics and then a lot of novelty games and oddities. Maybe not enough to satisfy a seasoned board gamer, but for me and my group they have everything we need and then some. If you don't fall into the latter, they welcome you to bring your own games as well. 

I highly recommend Exploding Kittens after a few too many adult beverages. You can thank me for the laughs later. See you again soon, Side Quest!"}
{"text":"On a visit to Cleveland, my boyfriend, who is an avid board gamer, and I stopped into Side Quest to check it out. The owners did not do much with the space in terms of making it feel like a board game bar, it just feels like you're in bar. They serve beer and hard liquor as you would expect in a bar. They have several tables, but a lot of them aren't even big enough to hold  a standard board. 

While they do have about 100 games in their collection, it is not a very impressive selection compared to other board game places that I've been. They offer classic American board games and others, like Ticket to Ride and Jaipur. The shelf of games is set up across from the bar, and once you have selected your game, you have to head over to the bar to get the moveable parts of the game, like the pieces, cards, etc. They charge $2 per game rental. One of the games we played wasn't in the greatest condition with a ripped board and grimy cards. The place did get crowded and most people, other than those sitting at the bar, were playing board games. It was louder than I like for playing games, and a drunk guy behind us spilled his drink all over the game they were playing.

Overall, I really like the concept of a board game bar, but this just felt like a bar with board games to me. Also, they try to embrace the geek culture a little too much, which can be off-putting to some. I'm all for a place that is board game-friendly, but I think the concept was executed poorly."}
{"text":"I've probably been here a million times.  There's always something going on, and there are people you wouldn't meet at your usual Lakewood bars.  It's just comfortable here.  

The beer list is pretty high-end;  they've got a lot of experimental stuff on there, and some old favorites like Schlitz, Pabst, and the like in ample supply.

The cocktails are inventive, but the bartenders aren't above making the traditional staples like a Tom Collins or whiskey sour.  The selection of liquor is good, but not overwhelming.  

Above all, there is something always happening.  Every night of the week is an event or party of some sort- it never gets dull, though.  Some are low-key, others get pleasantly rowdy.  Part of that comes from the crowd that comes in- there's a few of everyone here, and the place always welcomes more.  

The real centerpiece of the bar is the game selection.  For $1 a person, you can rent any game.  Any.  Game.  Some nights, the games are free to rent.  There are always strangers willing to hop in, and it's a great way to try before you buy or make new friends.  They're also cool with you bringing your own game in, and won't charge you a ridiculous fee for doing so unlike some other places in town."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Such a nice change from the normal Lakewood scene. The place is well designed, with nice big retro dining tables everywhere. They have a decent selection of games, and the drink menu is bonkers! A lot of awesome cocktails with a totally geeky Harry Potter type theme. So cool. I recommend the butter beer drink or the golden snitch shot. 

The owners are awesome, she was our bartender and was incredibly attentive, and fun to chat with. 

After our first trip here we now have a standing weekly double date to this place. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This place is so cool!! I had never been because I thought I wouldn't be the right crowd to go here but I had so much fun. They have so many board games to choose from and even video games. 

I had some kind of alcoholic hot chocolate which was delicious and the served it out of a random mug which I loved. It makes it feel so homey. 

Also they are very accommodating in making sure females feel safe at all times which I think is awesome. I really love this place and will definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"Horrendous service. Me and my friends sat at the bar, money in-hand, waiting to order a bunch of drinks and play some bored games. Waited for 15 minutes. The bartender acknowledged her friends behind us but continued to ignore us. So we gave up and left. I don't understand why they would ignore paying customers."}
{"text":"Drinks are creative and good for the most part. The crowd for the theme night tonight was fun...but it was way too loud to actually hear The Labyrinth. I have been hear a couple times to play games and drink some mead. They do not have food, so DO NOT come hungry, unless you really like gummy sharks( upon request in drinks).

I do think drinks are rather pricy, but it is an experience I must say."}
{"text":"This place has such good potential. We went here to visit family and play some games. We loved the drinks, food, and general idea of this place. HOWEVER, our food took extremely long to come out cold. We ordered two salads and got one a half hour after the other. The writing in the bathroom was atrocious. If the service was better, the bar tender wasn't apathetic, and they scrubbed the writing off of the bathroom walls,  i would be back."}
{"text":"Side Quest has a surprisingly good craft beer selection! Lots of cool Belgians and hard to find stuff!

The bartenders are super friendly and the place is laid back enough that I feel comfortable there are as non-nerd with my nerdy boyfriend and friends. Trivia on Thursdays is super fun and the host is funny! 

We've been to Retro Who night which is interesting because it only plays on the main TV and there are other social groups (knitting, etc) going on at the same time making it hard to focus on the TV. I'm not super into the show (and only come for the great beer, who am I kidding?) but the set up of this night could certainly be improved.

Overall, I'm pretty impressed with the place!"}
{"text":"This bar is the friendliest place anyone can go.  The board games available to rent for a dollar per person playing the game, the reasonably priced craft beer selection, their amazing unique mixed drink and shot list, and staff make this my favorite place.  I never walk out of there without at least 1 interesting conversation or making a new friend.  
They have wonderful theme nights as well as fun events.  Their staples include Mario Mondays where you can play console games on big screens; Free Play Tuesdays where you don't have to pay the dollar rental fee on the board games (great way to try one out); Bar Against Humanity where they have the bar break into teams and play Cards Against Humanity; Geeks Who Drink Trivia on Thursdays; Beer and More Beer on Friday and Saturday respectively; Sundays are the beginner's D&D game as well as a Stitch'n'Bitch that includes all crafty mind peeps. 
A fan of beer?  This is your place.  There is a Beer Society that meets every last Tuesday of the month to try a sampling of beers.  You get about 4 or 5 4oz pours for about $10.  Sometimes a little more when it's expensive like meads or the new high ABV beers that just became available in OH, but no more than $15 thus far.  Beer Society costs $20 for a year membership.  You get a t-shirt, access to the closed Facebook group, discounts on the beers sampled and first crack at it, discounts on other events like Beer Fight Club, and a boisterous  group of beer enthusiasts that you can geek out with over the new beers."}
{"text":"Themed trivia, creative drinks, and Their tofu wings are a little pricey, but delicious. The fries are four dollars, and they give you a ton. Trivia is very fun, but if it's a popular theme, (Harry Potter) try to get there early. I've also found that it is a nice place to watch sports games and have a seat even though not everyone there will be into it. It's a less expensive board game bar than Tabletop which makes it a great alternative, a better value, with it's own unique atmosphere. Love it!"}
{"text":"This is definitely one of the best bars to spend an evening, if you have Amber as your bartender, it is the best bar that evening.  KT is always good to have as well.  If you get to have Amber or KT, you're in a good place.  If you can't tell, what keeps me coming here are these two bartenders.  

All that being said, the things I avoid are some of the clubs and recently some of the activities.  What once felt inclusive feels like pressure and exclusivity (for very bad reasons), what once was a relaxed atmosphere feels now tense.  Some of the decorations and sayings, which can be viewed as cute, start to annoy someone that realizes they aren't temporary or in good fun or humor. 

A few months ago I would say this is the bar to go to, easily one of the top three spots I personally go to and/or recommend.  I'm hoping this place continues to be successful, but at the moment, I fear the direction it is taking is not a good one, but instead one that (has been) developing an us versus them mentality, and is far less than it could be.

The Side Quest 6 Months ago had 5 stars and a glowing review.  Hopefully they return to what they are  and stop reaching for what they aren't..."}
{"text":"A nerd/geek/other bar? Sign me up! I've never had a bad time here. The bartenders are all friendly and chatty, the multitude of TV's on a bunch of channels is awesome (yay for Discovery and BBC!), and the beer is fairly priced. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a new place to hang out, or for someone who doesn't feel comfortable in the many sports bars that populate this area."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness! This place was so much fun! 
First I want to comment on the bartender, she was so friendly and seemed genuinely happy to be there. So nice. 
So, as others have said, the idea is that you can rent games. The price is $1 per person for unlimited play. As you can imagine the vibe in here is laid back and relaxed. Loved it. 
The place isn't huge and if you want to play a game, you kinda need a table so you will probably have to hang out a bit until you get one.
I almost want to keep this next part hushed, I don't want anyone to get any ideas for changing things there... but the prices on the drinks are great!
As far as food, they had some \"steambun\" sandwiches - I had the burger. Nice little snack for $3. Also had a bite of the black bean- skip that one. We also tried the fries, the cheesy fried things, and the buffalo chicken egg roll. Totally would go for for all three of those things again. Good bar food. Simple. Just what you would want when drinking. Would love to see a bigger menu, but since food is not what this place is about, I get it.
Overall, I'll totally be back. Would love to try Trivia Thursdays."}
