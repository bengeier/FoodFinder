{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants I've ever been to. It was very unique, the service was great, and it had really good food that I thought was worth the price. My friend and I were intrigued by the balsamic popcorn and thought we'd try it - the julienned bell peppers tossed with balsamic vinegar and some herbs with the popcorn was such a genius idea. Ordered the seared scallops, which was seared and cooked just right. We ordered two desserts - the salted caramel affogato and the 'Some Like It Hot'. If you have to choose one, I'd recommend the latter - although jalapeno ice cream sounded really weird, it doesn't really taste purely like a jalapeno; rather, it helps to balance the thick flourless chocolate cake, giving it a slight kick at the end. the salted caramel affogato was really good too - the espresso helped to balance out the really sweet salted caramel, but overall, the 'Some Like it Hot' choice was so different and so good. If I went back, i'd just get three of those."}
{"text":"This is some of the best food you'll ever eat. I can't rave enough about the entire menu. Everything is exquisitely prepared and presented. The prices are justifiable considering the quality and selection. I can't tell enough people about this place. Just go! Make a reservation!"}
{"text":"I love the food here! It's always fresh and local and prepared really well. Yum! If you don't want to commit to dinner, go for lunch when you can get great plates for around $10. If the delicious food isn't enough to lure you, go grab a drink or dessert and check out the cool building and interior of this former bank."}
{"text":"Awesome place.  Started off with the Cherry Bombs, which are tomatoes stuffed with cheese and chorizo and then wrapped in a wonton and fried. It was different but a really good and savory starter.  My husband ordered the ribeye medium rare. It was fatty and dull of flavor, and SO tender. It was topped with this tomato basil mixture that was amazing.  I ordered the veal chop medium rare with a creamy truffle mushroom sauce. WOW it was so good. The potatoes in the side were perfection.  Creme brulee for dessert and it was just okay. Nothing special.   Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"The meal I had at Crop Bistro will remain indelibly stamped in my memory.  The setting was romantic, the wait staff was super attentive, and the food was beyond compare.  We decided to forgo appetizers, but I applaud that they offer foie gras.  I ordered a pumpkin pie martini that was both boozy and decadent.  Hands down, it was the best dessert martini I've had, and trust I've had a few.  I was going for a whole pumpkin theme, I suppose, because I got the pumpkin-mascarpone ravioli for my main. I realize that pumpkin ravioli might not sound that exotic or fantastic, but let me tell you, it was everything.  Two palm-sized raviolis came atop a bed of vegetable ragu and everything was drenched in brown butter.  I lamented my lack of extra stomachs as I neared the middle of our meal, for I wanted to eat on and on.   My man got the rib eye which he demolished, but not before I could try how perfectly it was cooked.  For dessert we each had a warlock southern tier pumpkin porter - possibly the greatest pumpkin beer on the market - and a chocolate salted pretzel something-or-other that had the density of a brick and the flavor of happiness.  You'll drop some cash going here, but I think it's worth every penny.  The building itself would be enough to make me want to go back.  The beautiful, high ceilings really add to the atmosphere of opulence.  If you've never been, I'd put making reservations at this place on my top five list of things to do."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night with my husband, first off let me say how beautiful it is inside  very majestic.  The hostess was very pleasant ,we had reservations so we were seated right away.  Our server was very attentive and was at our table very quick.  When describing the specials she was very descriptive ,so that you vould almost taste it. We started off with the fried calamari  (normally we never order fried calamari because every place we have ever ordered it ,it was chewy) this was the BEST calamari I have ever had so succulent,  I could make a meal off of that alone. We also had the tuna appetizer  words cannot express how perfect it was. My husband had the ribeye and I had the salmon both cooked to perfection.  The salmon arrived at the table hot off the grill, so hot that I had to let it cool before I took a bite. We ended the evening with a cup of expresso and the Nonlogic pretzel pudding  which was very nice. Overall if you are looking for a special place to go witn great food and a beautiful atmosphere,  great service the by all means give Crop Bistro a try, I would recommend reservations. We went on a Saturday night , it wasn't too busy but in all fairness both the cavs and the indians  (game 3 of the world series ) were playing."}
{"text":"Crop is one of the few restaurants in Cleveland I've been to repeatedly.  Usually I am so busy trying to plow through a list of must-try restaurants that I'm hesitant to go back somewhere I've already been.  But Crop is worth the return.  (Some of this surely has to do with location, as it is perfectly situated for those of us who live and work downtown.)  I've done Crop many different ways: at the Chef's table, out on the patio, in booths, for workday lunch, for Friday night date, for Sunday Supper at the bar, for Restaurant Week prix fixe, and for ladies night bday celebration.  Across all those events, Crop has been enjoyable.  I love the idea of Crop for sure, using local food, having a visible proprietor, etc.  The theatrics of the open kitchen, the herbs growing out front, and the weekend late evening band concerts all make eating there fun.  As for the food, it doesn't always blow my socks off, but it is consistent, and often downright yummy.  I've never had a bad dish, just some that didn't pack the punch I was hoping for.  For instance, loved the idea of the balsamic popcorn, but it just came off a bit soggy and odd.  Even when I don't love a dish, though, I am always intrigued by the combination of flavors.  It's rarely bland and often imaginative.  Generally what Crop does best, it seems, is throw things together - which means the special salads and pastas.  These are generally fresh, abundant, lively, and satisfying.  I'd trust them on the specials.  And even though a full-on weekend dinner there can add up in price, there are a ton of affordable options, which I really appreciate.  Work lunches are light and summery and delicious, for around $10-12, a few more if you add soup or a salad.  By far the best eating experience I've had is the Sunday Supper, with heaping glorious salad and seafood pasta and dessert all for $25.  Support Crop.  It's one of the best and most interesting dining options in the Warehouse District for sure."}
{"text":"Second time here and i'd go back again and again.  The old bank building is amazing itself.  The restaurant is great.  Very large dining area and high ceilings so  you don't feel packed in too closely with other guests.  Absolutely loved the calamari app since it's not the typical rings, but a spiral cut with a delicious sauce on top. The cherry bomb app is good as well and the short ribs entree, even though small, was delicious and filling.   I'd recommend Crop."}
{"text":"Average service,  started with corn chowder which had a nice flavor but very much needed some seasoning. We tried several apps most were good old favorites surprised to not see much new in the way of apps. No dinner specials which I was also surprised me a little.  Ribeye dinner I ordered was quite good, the clear winner at the table. Tried some Mac and cheese as well and it was rather bland, really could have used some salt and pepper as well.  They have a nice dessert selection and most were good although I did not love my apple tart."}
{"text":"The room is awesome (note it is loud). Food was decent -on par with good CLE restaurants. The service though was bad. The waiter was rude, the sommelier was worse.  At that price level I expect more, they should go to L'Albatros and learn what good service is."}
{"text":"Cool concept , the cherry bomb app was a neat idea and tasty . As far as the atmosphere . When you walk in at first your like wow , then once your sitting and take it in for a moment you realize it's kinda food court ish , wrong lighting and acoustics . I'm glad we went for a first time look as see type of thing but we will not return . The menu was very small . More appetizers then main course and for desert we got the peanut butter one as recomended by our server  the angle food cake was very dry and moose was warm ish and a burnt marshmallow over top I love deserts and that one I took one bite and was done ! But over all it was nice cool to see good food just limited selection."}
{"text":"I've been to maybe a handful of the \"top\" Cleveland restaurants, and I found this one to be the best. Looking for nice venue and ambiance? Check. The old bank atmosphere is unique and the area is spacious. Could write more details about the food, but bottom line, you won't regret coming here. My favorite spot in Cleveland so far."}
{"text":"Brought a group for a business lunch. They were in awe of the optics but unsure about the menu because it didn't feel traditional or typical. I encouraged them - indicating everything is good- no choice is bad. We started with the Balsamic popcorn. Loved it!!!! The selections across the table were diverse and of course... Everyone loved it! Southern pallets and all!  I frequent here a few times a month for wine at the bar and I am yet to be disappointed.  Fabulous place for those visiting the CLE and locals who appreciate a good barkeep and a \"guest\"  centered dining experience"}
{"text":"I went here recently on a double date. The decor is impressive. The menu was small but was nice not too have so many overwhelming choices. There are a lot of unique options for cocktails. I got the shortribs and my husband got the steak. Both were good but not sure it was worth the cost. Overall we were satisfied but with dinner and a drink for two we spent $100...we have no complaints but seemed more expensive than it may be worth but I was glad we tried something new."}
{"text":"Places like this make me nervous. I'm not a very adventurous eater and on top of that I'm a vegetarian. To me,  \"Fancy\" restaurants all seem to just mix weird stuff with other weird stuff and for some reason people rave about it.  Crop has their share of weird stuff  (I'm talking to you martini with a deviled egg in it) but were super nice  and prepared my meal with plain soba noodles instead of cinnamon noodles. The service was really good. Everyone dining with our group seemed really happy with their meals.  It was a fun evening and I would go back there any time."}
{"text":"This is by far the WORST venue there is. Ursula and her staff were so unaccomodating. She would promise you something and the next time you talk with her she would say she couldn't deliver or if she did it would be at a premium. We were promised so many things over and over again and they did not deliver. This venue ended up cancelling my wedding 5 weeks prior to my wedding date! I mean seriously who does that. Not to mention, the head chef and owner is so arrogant to the fact that he thinks his food is all that and did not even want to do a tasting. Also, they wanted me to rent my own dishes when they said they could accommodate up to 220 people. Ursula should not be doing this as a profession..she clearly can not handle weddings. The lack of expertise, customer service and professionalism is non existent as it relates to Crop."}
{"text":"We have loved the brunch and the incredible service we get at Crop, which had us considering hosting our small second wedding there.  Wow ... I cannot say enough about the staff that made this evening absolutely amazing.  It could not have been simpler to hold an event here ... the planning was simple and painless and we were able to use the Skylight Penthouse, with gorgeous views of CLE and beautiful evening lights.    The food is always incredible here... from our apps like the HUGE bacon-wrapped scallops, smoked salmon, etc.,  to the 3-course plated meal and I guarantee you will be happy with all of the service from table to bar.    Thanks so much to the best staff in Cleveland for making our night!"}
{"text":"If you love great food and excellent service you will love Crop.  This was our first time at Crop and we had heard good things but the experience exceeded our expectations.  The Braised Short Ribs over Barley was outstanding and my wife's Tasmanian Salmon was done to perfection.  Having just moved from San Francisco SF has nothing on Cleveland restaurants and especially Crop Bistro.  By the way the redone Bank Building that the restaurant is in is stunning.   Depending on your age it will take you back to being a kid and going into big ornate banks...the building is stunning.    Randy G"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Great appetizers! Entrees were okay.  Have been to Crop 3 times so far .. Great experiences past 2 times, unfortunately this visit did not live up to those visits. I will, however give it one more time"}
{"text":"Crop is worth visiting for the architecture and ambiance alone. The high ceilings are incredible but the place still feels warm. We sat at the chef's table and enjoyed a small bite brought over by Chef Steve himself. Highlights: great cocktails, balsamic popcorn, red snapper special and salted caramel pretzel dessert. My husband said it was one of the best desserts he had ever had. So good that we had to bring one to-go for his parents.   Crop is definitely one of the restaurants in Cleveland that has helped revitalize the food scene. After living in Chicago for the last few years, my husband and I were pretty spoiled by great food. As a returning Clevelander, I'm happy to see restaurants using locally sourced ingredients and helping to develop C-Town's food culture. I'll definitely be back to Crop!"}
{"text":"I went to Crop with my parents on a visit to my home town and we all agreed the meal was flawless. Our order was challenging because I ordered an appetizer, salad and entree and my mother ordered two appetizers and my dad ordered only an entree. The server quickly figured out a plan to make the meal flow."}
{"text":"It is beautiful place inside - has good food but going on Thursday with only about 10 days filled the noise level was ridiculous.  I would be afraid to go on a Friday or Saturday when the place was filled - I am not sure if I will revisit for this reason only."}
{"text":"Crop Bistro is an experience and one of the best restaurants in the city.  Crop Bistro is located in an old bank lobby. The space is BEAUTIFUL. 35 foot decorative and ornate ceilings, two story windows. There is a history of the building in one of the menus that you should read. There is a vault that we weren't able to check out but I hear it is a must see.  Order: - Blood Orange Margarita - Seared Hudson Valley Foie Gras - Duck  Don't order: - Truffled Popcorn  Iffy: - Chile Deviled Eggs - Peppermint Cocoa  Their foie gras is the best foie gras I've ever had. It's served over a cake with pomegranate seeds and (what I think are) two tortilla chips. It's the perfect blend of flavors (savory and sweet) and texture (soft and crunchy).  The duck was amazing and cooked to perfection. The portion was a good size too.  Don't waste your time on the truffled popcorn. The portion is huge and you won't end up eating it. It's nothing spectacular either.  I'm a big fan of deviled eggs. The deviled eggs weren't bad, but they weren't amazing. I've had better. They are served with a crisp piece of prosciutto in each egg. For decor, they dyed half the eggs pink. It' s a cute touch. These do have a kick to them, so beware.  I was very disappointed in the peppermint cocoa. It's a piece of chocolate cake served with marshmallow and one scoop of peppermint ice cream. The cake was dry and the marshmallow was a bit hard (stale?). The best part of this dessert was the peppermint ice cream, which we definitely could have ate more of.   I highly recommend Crop Bistro and cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"We stopped here before seeing a show at Playhouse Square. We had a party of 5 and no reservation, the place was very empty when we entered and the hostess had to check if they had anything available which made us all chuckle.   We did get seated and everything was absolutely delicious. It was our first time there and our server was great and efficient! The calamari had its own little flare and was great! We shared the short rib noddles and the split portio was huge, luckily we shared! We will definitely be back here!"}
{"text":"Ah, yes, mmm, yum, FINALLY an upscale meal that is worth the price tag.  Last night was my first (of hopefully many) experiences at Crop Bistro.  We took advantage of restaurant week to try this place out.  I loved the decor and the service was quick and friendly.   I ordered the $30 prix fix meal, which include the Cherry Bomb, Seared Scallops, and the Cropper Nutter for dessert.  My dinner mate ordered the Cherry Chipotle Ribs.  Everything was super delicious, especially the Cherry Bomb.  I wasnt sure what it would be like, but I saw such good reviews of it on this site.  it was AMAZING, to say the least, I wised I could have had a whole meal of it.  Another highlight was the Ribs, it came with a side of cheesy broccoli and sweet potato grits.  Everything was well cooked, well seasoned, the perfect temperature.  Yum yum yum!  My only complaint, and this is a strange one, is the plates that our food was served on.  They kept sliding around on the glass topped table.  I was trying to cut my scallops, and the plate spun around.  The same thing was happening to my dinner mate.  Strange, right?  New plates, or maybe place mats could correct this?  I look forward to more meals at Crop, and I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great meal!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Inside of an old bank building, you're transported back in time to when architecture was wonderful. Mesmerizing! The good is great, I get the chicken and waffles almost every time. A wonderful place for a special occasion or just because. Parking can be sketchy, so come prepared to valet."}
{"text":"Small cozy casual atmosphere, may be a little darker than typical restaurants. Food is local and fresh. The salad is decent but not the best I've had. Portions are typically smaller than mediocre restuarants. I had the flatbread with thin slices of apples and melted cheese on top which was good (over priced?) and the seared scallops which were over salted but it was cooked just right. The place did not impress me:/"}
{"text":"I got the char sui short ribs. All I can say is it was ok. I was really looking forward to it, but it turned out it was so so. A bit on the heavy side. I liked the udon noodles it comes on, but the meat itself was just kind of weak. I was expecting something else. Someone else we were with ordered salmon and complained bitterly that it wasn't cooked properly. The wine list is just so so as well. Overall, if I go back, I'd try the thai salmon, as I wished I had ordered that instead."}
{"text":"I was in Cleveland for a business meeting and I wanted to eat somewhere that sourced locally grown food and so I picked Crop.  It was fantastic. I had a sublime beet and goat cheese salad followed by the mussels.  FANTASTIC.  Extra:  If you ask, they will give you a tour of their special party room which is downstairs in the vault."}
{"text":"First impression is that the building has a really Beautiful architecture, high ceilings, painting on the wall, etc. I ordered lamb and scallops and like both dishes. The soup of the day has lots of shrimp and lobster meat in it but too salty. The honey cheese cake is also really nice, it has a light texture."}
{"text":"I am in love with Crop Bistro!  My husband and I had lunch there this week.  I had the most divine warm winter salad.  The salad has bits of kale, sweet potato, quinoa, dried apricots, and Marconi almonds.  It was served warm, perfectly cooked and flavored! I am craving it just thinking about it!  My husband, a meat guy, had the beef udon noodle soup. He said it was the perfect meal on a cold Cleveland day. I fashion myself to be a bit of a foodie and I can honesty say, it was one of the best meals I have had out in a long time.  We enjoyed it so much that we reserved a table for 4 Saturday night.  Matthew, our server, was warm and good natured.  We enjoyed his company and asked for his section again Saturday night.    Go!!!"}
{"text":"Without a doubt, one of my top three dinning experiences in Ohio and one of my top ten in this country. Chef Steve is brilliant. Completely understands food and wine as two of the best food groups on this planet. Great wine list and the atmosphere is unparalleled anywhere. Wine dinners in the vault room are not to be missed. We'll be back again and agin."}
{"text":"The space is absolutely beautiful and the cocktails are fabulous. If the food were at the same level, this would be a 5-star place. It isn't. The food is good. Good, but not particularly memorable.   We did have some lovely, perfectly cooked scallops with a lobster sauce that was a bit overpowering. I can't even remember what our other appetizer was. (This was just 2 days ago. I LOVE food. If I don't remember what I ate, it wasn't bad and wasn't great. It was passable.)   My boyfriend had the fried pork chop with chorizo gravy. Similar to the scallop, the sauce was a bit overpowering. I love bold flavors, but balance was lacking here.  I had the short ribs. The pasta that accompanied them was the best thing I ate that night. The ribs themselves were fine. Again, not particularly memorable. Desert was along the same lines -- passable, not memorable.  I'll definitely go back to the bar for drinks and maybe apps, but the $300 we spent for dinner for 2 (with wine, cocktails, apps, desert and coffee) would have been better spent at any number of other places (Greenhouse Tavern, L'Albatross, Michelangelo's, Fire are just the first few that come to mind)."}
{"text":"Welcome to Cleveland!  I certainly wasn't expecting a restaurant of this caliber when I came back to town this week.  We stopped in on a Monday night, and every table was taken, so we found seats at the bar.  The building is very cool; it was constructed in 1925 and was a bank until the late 1970's.  The did an outstanding job renovating for it's current use.  We ordered the Crispy Pork Belly, Flatbread Nan pizza, Pheasant and Lemon Meringue Pie for dessert.  Everything was VERY good.    They also feature a great beer and wine list, and have a surprisingly  good selection of Ports as a digestif.    If you live in Cleveland and you haven't been here yet, shame on you!  If you're passing through, definitely check it out.  Be sure to make reservations!"}
{"text":"Best foodie experience I've had in a long time!  With a setting as beautiful as this, the food better rock or its a disappointment.   No fear, Crop Bistro delivered!  My dining partner was very happy with his food selection,  the Ultimate Crop Burger- this thing was huge!  He also sampled one of their signature drinks fromthe bar and was pleased with the unique blend of flavors.  I ordered the Chicken and Waffles and was really glad I did.  Although the waffles were reminiscent of stove top stuffing in flavor, their crispness made up for it.  The chicken breast was flavorful,  crisp, and cooked to perfection, and I was relieved to discover that it was boneless. The sauce was just the right compliment.   Presentation was obviously important, as both dishes arrived on appealingly garnished plates.  The staff was attentive,  except for the hostess who failed to greet us when we arrived through the alternate entrance, and then ignored us once we walked over to her stand. Luckily our waiter greeted us instead and took over the experience. All of the other staff kept our glasses full and made up for the rude hostess.  Overall a \"must experience\" Cleveland dining treat!"}
{"text":"Crop Bistro is amazing, I really enjoy this place. Crop Bistro is in an old bank, and it makes for a really nice atmosphere. The high ceilings and architecure from the original bank is still there which makes for a unique experience. I went for lunch, it is walking distance from West Side market so making a combination trip of west side market and crop makes for a great afternoon. Staff was very friendly, I asked about the private dining in the vault and she was able to walk us down and show us around. Cant wait to go back, food was delicious too :)."}
{"text":"When I die I hope heaven looks like the inside of this beautiful building and serves their food. Do yourself a favor and get the lunch Mac and Brisket!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Cleveland.  It the type of place you go if you want a perfect dinner, and makes you wish you had access to such fresh and high quality produce.  I've never been served anything here that hasn't been excellent.  One time, and I'm not sure how I feel about this, but the waiter told me the steak I was eating had been out in the pasture moo-ing that morning (a bit grim to think about, but, wow).  Out of personal preference, I generally do not order the steak here.  I find the more obscure items on the menu to be the most impressive (the duck! so good).  Make sure to make reservations - they are required and they book up fast.  My other recommendation is if you want to go here but not spend a fortune, try hitting them up for lunch, which is very affordable.  I always look forward to the next special occasion when I will enjoy dinner at this place!!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure that when I was growing up in Greater Cleveland in the 70s and early 80s, there were very few options for fine and/or trendy dining. And up until the last few years, it seemed that Cleveland continued to lag behind other Midwestern cities when it came to a restaurant scene. Not anymore. On a trip there last weekend to see the folks, I was happily overwhelmed by the number of options. It's great to see such vitality in Cleveland.  We went to Crop for lunch, and we're glad we did. The place gives a great first impression, as it's huge and lovingly restored from its roots as a bank. Julie was our server... she was knowledgeable, friendly, and efficient. I got the BBQ meatloaf sandwich, which was messy but delicious. We split the deviled eggs... they were amazing. I'd go back!"}
{"text":"I really love Crop. They always have seasonal items on their menu and are super creative. I like their use of local products. The restaurant is beautiful and I've never had a meal that I didn't love. I especially love their desserts- which is how I actually first started going to Crop (their pastry chef used to work next door also). They are so creative and fun."}
{"text":"Delicious!! The food and drinks are amazing! Everything is so fresh! Their staff is entertaining and knowledgeable. Plus, the building is way cool! It can be hard to hear your party in certain places of the restaurant- the high ceilings make for a noisy eating experience. However, the food makes up for any small discrepancy."}
{"text":"It was decent, but we liked the old Crop better. The new space is inside the lobby of an old bank. Yes it's beautiful and grand (think old train station). But it's also cold, loud and the opposite of intimate. It would be worlds better if they got rid of the thumping music--with the marble floors and walls all you can hear is the bass. The service was not too great and the food was only about 3/4 good. The appetizers were the best part--delicious. The entrees were hit or miss. The ravioli was undercooked and doughy but we ate most of it anyways because we never saw the waitress during the meal. When we told her about it afterwards as a suggestion to the chef, she didn't seem to care and was annoyed we made the suggestion. The steak was good, but not the best we've ever had. The waffle dessert was OK. The cherries were so heavily soaked in alcohol, we couldn't eat them. But we did eat the waffle and ice cream which were very good. Again, when we told the waitress the cherries were inedible, she didn't care and all but rolled her eyes. A note to servers: when someone gives you a suggestion/complaint about a dish you're serving and charging a lot of money for, act interested/concerned, acknowledge it and say \"thank you for the suggestion, I will be sure to tell the chef.\" The hostess desk might also benefit from a tutorial on customer service and knowing what to do when someone makes a suggestion.  With some TLC working out the kinks, this has the potential to be a great restaurant."}
{"text":"I went to Crop a few times when they were on West 6th Street and was very excited when they took the initiative to renovate a historic bank building on Lorain. Crop is now the proud occupant of a drop-dead gorgeous space which showcases their amazing culinary staff's efforts.   Walking into the Walker and Weeks designed bank lobby, you feel like you are in Grand Central station and are reminded that Cleveland was once one of the fastest growing and influential cities in the country. We are lucky to have these grand spaces in such good condition and even better, located in always fun Ohio City. The only drawback to the space is the noise level. It's a 30 foot ceiling, marble covered echo chamber and it may be hard to have a conversation amongst the din. Who cares though when you can enjoy the space and the amazing food.   Regarding the food, everything we had was awesome, with the most memorable dish possibly being the caramel pretzel dessert we had. Crop focuses on locally and artisan sourced food and employs innovative cooking techniques. I've enjoyed everything I've eaten or drank there.   I'll be returning to Crop on my birthday and I'm sure it will be the same great experience."}
{"text":"I'm not one to ever write a negative review unless the situation calls for it. My girlfriend and I made a reservation for 8:15, and we arrived right on time. We were told a table would be ready shortly and we happily went to the bar to grab one of Crop's fantastic cocktails (every one I've tried is fantastic).   It took over an hour to be seated, what's the point of making a reservation? I've worked in the service industry, an hour for 2 is ridiculous even for a walk up.  Our server started out great, getting our drinks and food order. Then up and disappeared. I don't know if he was cut or trying to get ahead of his closing duties (since it took so long to get us seated in the first place), but a half hour after our plates were cleared I had to get up and walk all the way across the large dining room to grab him in one of the server station.  I know a few great server's there, the bartender that took care of us was great, the food was amazing as always. But unnecessarily wasting over an hour and a half of our Saturday evening has left a horrible memory and I doubt we'll be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I have visited Crop a few times now and every time I never want to leave, from the time you walk in the door to be greeted by the hostess to having a drink at the bar...I love red wine and the Selby was great....the food is to die for and the Chef well what can I say but awesome.....nice for a couples night out or intimate group of friends.....definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I went to Crop for lunch and cannot wait to return. It is a very pleasant place to eat. It's fairly quiet (at lunch anyway), and it's a very comfortable, stylish space. More importantly, the food was delicious. I had the pig mac with the waldorf cous cous thing. I love pork so I was pretty excited about the sandwich, and it was better than I expected! Excellent flavor combinations. They really know how to cook a pig (a couple different ways) at this place. The salad was cool, crunchy, and the right sweetness and tangyness. I also loved the corn bread I was given at the beginning of the meal."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere due to the interior space and design. Fried oysters were excellent. Balsamic popcorn tasted stale. Beef short ribs were excellent. My ribeye was not."}
{"text":"I went to Crop this past weekend for a birthday celebration. From start to finish, the experience was wonderful. The food was superb. We started with the calamari and soft shell crab. Then, we had the pork paillard,  shrimp, lamb, something by BIL did not share :) Our server, whose  name escapes me, but used to work at Red, was very attentive and knowledgeable without being pushy or overbearing. Roberto , the sommelier, was passionate and entertaining. He went above and beyond. Julio and his son, Carlos, were wonderful, professional, yet very personable. Thank you for making my birthday dinner fantastic."}
{"text":"We went to Crop for my wife's birthday dinner. They did not have reservations past 6 PM, so we had to have an early dinner. As soon as we walked in, we loved the look of the place. The high ceilings, marble floor and general look of the place was fantastic. The service was very good. Our drink orders were taken immediately and the service was good throughout the dinner.  The drink menu was extensive. There were a lot of cocktails to choose from and a few decent beers on the tap list. I got Dogfish Head Chicory Stout on tap, which was fantastic. My wife got a red wine from a pretty long list. Neither of us got cocktails, since we came from Velvet Tango Room, but they looked pretty good.  As an appetizer, we ordered the truffle oil covered popcorn, and it was unique and incredible. If you go to Crop, you need to get this. For dinner, I ordered the Duck Duck Chicken, which had a fried egg, bacon, and duck. For $28, it was definitely over priced. It was a good, but not great dinner. My wife had the Ohio Ribeye. The entire dish was completely covered in pepper and the steak itself had a sauce that does not belong on a good steak. However, the steak was cooked perfectly. But at $27, it was also over priced.   Overall, the experience was pretty good, but not great. With so many great restaurants within a few miles, I would recommend one of those. You can get far superior food for less at a place like Lolita, Momocho, or Market Garden. If you need to try it, I would go just for drinks, popcorn, and the environment."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Crop Bistro this weekend, and it was our second visit.  We absolutely love this place.  Quickly, this restaurant is turning into my favorite place to eat dinner in Cleveland.  The food is a bit expensive, but you're paying for both the high quality of the food and service.    Whenever my water glass would become the slightest bit empty, someone was always quickly there to refill it.  The Chicken and Waffles are incredible.  I had the Mahi Mahi on special last night and it was tremendous.  I can't say enough great things about this restaurant.  The service is impeccable, the food arrives quickly, and it's delicious.  You will not be disappointed at Crop!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was a mix of good and bad. The wine was good but overall the food was bad. The popcorn is highly overrated. The salmon was good but not great. The ravioli and the pork were subpar to say the least. Will not go back."}
{"text":"Ok, this place now does brunch, and what a brunch!  All the fixings you would expect including gorgeous crab legs, prime rib and omelettes made to order- (you choose the additions to your omelette,including lobster!)  Fabulous dessert selection and your choice of Mimosa or Bloody Mary, included.  While this brunch is new for Crop, they are doing a booming business after only 4 weeks, so be sure to make a reservation.  Easy valet parking and access, so my father in law, on a walker, was no challenge.  He especially was a fan of the tour of the vault, after brunch.  Acoustics are still not great for this space, a bit loud, but the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"Sunday Brunch! It was AWESOME . It exceeded my expectations.  Crop was one of the best dining experiences I've had in a very longtime. It has something for everyone's taste buds."}
{"text":"Fantastic. Fresh food, unique and delicious cocktails, relaxed yet sophisticated atmosphere, knowledgeable  and friendly servers, enthusiastic and friendly chef/owner, perfect portions.  Delicious delicious delicious.  Went with my husband while visiting from out of town.   We had a great time but I think this would also be a great place to hang out with friends.  Wish I could take Crop home with me!  Go, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"We went to Crop before a show and were really happy with our choice.  The building itself is amazing - very visually pleasing.  We had reservations, so we were seated right away.  We both ordered a specialty cocktail and had the calamari as an appetizer.  Also - we both had a bowl of seafood chowder, which was delicious!  Main course was very good - I had the crop pasta and my husband had the short ribs.  For dessert we shared the pretzel unlogic - which was a nice way to end our meal."}
{"text":"Came here during a business trip.  It was on a Monday so it was pretty empty.  You must try the popcorn appetizer! Truffle oil and Parmesan! Excellent!  The meals we're good sized portions and the ambiance super cool.  This place is inside a lobby of an old bank.  Very ornate and different!"}
{"text":"Crop continues to expand and refine all aspects of the business, getting better and better every time I return.  Food and service continue to be excellent, and the Vault private dining space is the best in this region of the US.  Small details in service such as the bar manager coming table side to deliver notes on the Scotch I enjoyed and asked about make for a great fine dining experience.  Crop is one of if not the best restaurant in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"A disappointing experience Saturday night. Beautiful space (though with a surprising number of open tables at 7 p.m.). Cocktails were decent. The calamari was good. But our waiter was pretty awful--his timing was completely off, and we spent a lot of time visibly craning our necks looking around for him. We waited 10 minutes for drink order to be taken; a cup of drip coffee after dinner literally took 14 minutes to arrive. The rest of the food was OK, but was negatively impacted by the poor service. In the end, we spent $250 for 4 people, and I find myself frustrated that it feels like we wasted a bunch of money on ultimately a mediocre eating experience."}
{"text":"If you don't eat here, you're a dummy.  That's right I said it.  I was staying at a hotel around the corner from Crop, and asked the concierge for a kickass lunch that's healthy.  They said that I should check out Crop.  A vast majority of their ingredients come from a stone's throw of Cleveland (on purpose) and they accommodate any dietary needs.  That was recommendation enough for me.  So I wandered down to Crop, which wasn't very busy at the time, and had a seat.  It's a bit of an upscale bistro in the sense that it has a great ambiance with rich woods and yuppie lighting.  But it had a lot of charm so I was anxious.    The servers dress with white shirts and ties, and the ambiance is as mentioned above, but I quickly came to find that (thankfully) the place isn't pretentious at all.  I looked over the menu a bit, but after a brief chat felt pretty comfortable with my server and said 'I'm not eating meat and I'm more than a little hungry.  Order for me'.  And what a job she did!  I ended up with this insane flatbread that had carmelized onions, some roasted veggies, feta cheese, and just a touch of maple syrup.  It had me spinning cartwheels it was so good.  The entree was an asparagus ravioli in a pesto sauce with roasted fennel, and it was equally as good.  But here's the best part.  Crop has a history and a drive based upon good, local food (when possible) prepared in an innovative and tasty way.  The co-founder and head chef, Steve, is a wizard in the kitchen.  I wasn't really able to chat it up with him, but his wife and co-owner Jackie was there and entertained my company for a bit, explaining the ethos behind the restaurant and the drive behind the vision.  I appreciated it so much!!    Even if you don't end up in Cleveland, you should check out www.cropbistro.com to learn a bit about what's behind the restaurant and see if you can find something like that in your area.  I recently read Barbara Kingsolver's Animal, Vegetable, Miracle like many other hipster douchebags and I'm starting to find more and more that where the food originates is just as important (if not more than) what it is.  It takes a lot of diesel fuel to haul a tomato from California to Maine.  Eat here.  NOW.  You're welcome."}
{"text":"Umm...OMG this place is amazing!  Went here for Valentine's dinner and I can see why it was booked up a month and a half early. It was worth snagging the 9:30 slot though, everything about the meal was perfect. Great drink list. And the DESSERT! Get two because you will not want to share!  I can't wait to go back to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"I'll start out by saying I never visited the old location. However, I can sympathize with Matthew M's lamentation about the new cavernous space and the loss of the cozy atmosphere of the original.  The space is a statement of grandiosity, for better or worse.  Having said that, I think Crop is setting a new standard for the Ohio City neighborhood I love so dearly. The spacious atmosphere is unlike anything else in the area or in neighboring Tremont. Ohio City restaurants range from rustic to boutique. Even the new Market Garden Brewery and sister Bier Markt/Bar Cento, although large spaces, are made to feel small and intimate, with lots of walls and dividers to break up the space. Crop, on the other hand, emphasizes its size and makes you feel like you're participating in an event.  It's a night on the town in itself, a place where you WANT to dress up.  Oh, yeah, the food. I almost forgot. I took a colleague from Germany there. We started with Balsamic Popcorn. Amazing. I've never had a bowl of popcorn/balsamic salad combination before. It sounded so strange that I figured it must be terrific, and it was. My colleague ordered the Ohio Ribeye. Within 3 minutes of its arrival he had a photo of it on is Facebook page. He was that impressed with the taste and appearance. His reaction was so strong I almost can't remember my Seared Ahi Tuna, but I do remember it. Thanks to Crop and many other great restaurants in Cleveland, we don't have to work too hard to present our city as a great place to live, work, and visit."}
{"text":"This review is getting three stars solely on the customer service experience. Duncan was our waiter on Friday night and I must say it was the most uncomfortable dining experience I've probably ever had. First I was with six of my girlfriends for two of the girls birthday dinners, one being my own. I made reservations and stated in the reservation that we were having two birthdays. Our birthdays were never even acknowledged, not even one time! I mean we had tons of gifts at the restaurant that were visible. You think that our server would engage in conversation and ask who's birthday it was, but not a word. Service was very slow, and drinks went empty as far as bar drinks go. Two of the girls ordered the short ribs and said they were a bit on the dry side. Two of the girls ordered ribeyes and said that they had a lot of gristle and very bland. One person ordered the lamb and said it was just okay. My girlfriend and I both got the special which was walleye and we both liked our meals very much. By the end of the meal we were just very annoyed with the service that we didn't even want to stay for desserts and nothing was offered to us for our birthdays. In my opinion any nice restaurant should offer a complementary birthday dessert, and most do from our experience. After he dropped off our checks he didn't even say thank you for dining with us, actually he didn't even say anything at all, good night, nothing!! Myself being formally in the service industry, I do expect certain things. This was just a miss! I will also end by saying that I have dined here once before and the manager was very kind and pleasant and gave us a tour of the vault. I will dine here again in the future but I will say that I will request a different server."}
{"text":"We love Crop!  I have been there 3 times now and just walking in the building gives you the feeling you are really having a dining experience.  The drinks are great and the waiters are attentive without being annoying.  I have yet to see the vault because we always feel bad asking, but maybe next time I'll be brave enough to get the tour.  I would give it 5 stars if the entrees this month still included Chicken and Waffles, or something a little bit less \"meaty\" if that makes sense?  My husband felt they were a little too \"Meatloaf and grandma's kitchen\" type foods this time.  I would like to see some different dishes when we go again, I know they switch them occasionally."}
{"text":"Had noon lunch on this beautiful June day and was amazed with everything at the Crop Bistro.  The Crop Burger surprised me in its size and flavor, and it arrived with perfectly proportioned salad and flavorful pasta.  From the service at the door, to the service throughout lunch--servers are happy and ready to please.  They seem proud of the Crop and should be.  An outstanding lunch with amazing 1920's architecture and minimalist updates--which was better?  The food and the setting?  The food and the service?  I will say good company on a beautiful day--and we hit the jackpot selecting the Crop Bistro.  Everything from the ceiling to the tables and plated out of the kitchen and into our mouths was excellent."}
{"text":"Dining at Crop Bistro was an all-around excellent experience- phenomenal food, service, and atmosphere. The old bank provides an exquisite setting for a romantic evening with someone you love."}
{"text":"The venue is beautiful. It's an impressive and historic space that is well cared for and beautifully decorated. We enjoyed that.  The menu is somewhat limited -- but that's OK. A limited menu allows a chef to focus and ensure that the food is excellent. Our food was very good but did not reach the level of excellent. Granted, we dined on a Monday night so perhaps the chef wasn't actually cooking that night.   The prices are set at the high end of the dining spectrum. Unfortunately our  total experience did not live up to the prices. One issue is that our waiter was not knowledgeable about food pairings and make a poor recommendation.   So overall, the ambience was beautiful but the service and food did not quite live up to the prices."}
{"text":"Great location in ohio city. Service was excellent. It was Sat night and full of kids from a high school homecoming which made it a bit loud. The open space and really high ceiling are unique. Food was outstanding, some of the best we have had in CLE."}
{"text":"Great food! Stopped in for a quick drink this week, and realized it had been way too long since my last meal here, which will definitely be rectified asap. I had the signature happy hour cocktail: the Paloma. It was pretty spectacular!"}
{"text":"Crop was the second stop on our restaurant week tour ....  Nice atmosphere - like the decor - and like that it departments from the vapid, faux sense of chic that is the warehouse district. ...  But, despite this, it didn't start out well.....  For those of you who aren't in the know, during restaurant week a select set of restaurants offer an appetizer, entree and dessert for 30.  It was a big thing in DC where we moved from, but here it is strangely hidden.  In fact, at Crop, there was absolutely no indication it was going on, and asking for the r.w. menu was very uncomfortable, and I had the distinct feeling that the server was irritated that this would be only a $60 dinner for two.  Yuck.    Anyhow, what saves crop from my wrath, is that the food was very good!  Very flavorful, well done quality ingredients.  We both loved our entrees, however the star was really the dessert - an apple cheddar buckle, which I didn't think I wanted based on this description, which was exceptionally, phenomenally good ....  I warn others that  all our food (appetizers, entree and dessert) had the same flavor combination - sweety, salty & sour - which I happen to love ... The chef here seems to have a vinegar fetish (basalmic, apple cider, you name it), which I absolutely love when done right (and it was) ...  Maybe that's just what I ordered?  Dunno.... but I will be back to try again."}
{"text":"Eh, meh.  When I think of Crop, I think:  overrated not worth the hype inflated (inflated ego, inflated prices, inflated everything)  The space is amazing, of course, and the food isn't bad per se, but it's not so great that it lives up to the reputation they're trying to cultivate for themselves. There are plenty of restaurants that are as good, if not better, and many of them are located just around the corner from Crop."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful. The Sleepy Hollow martini was amazing. Loved the Cherry Bombs. My daughter had Chicken and Waffles very tasty. I had a pasta dish with brisket, it was the special OMG. Beautiful building and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Don't believe the hype.  The place is absolutely stunning to walk into.  But, if you evaluate restaurants based on the food rather than just the atmosphere and hype, you'll be greatly disappointed.  Our table of 5 had:  Deviled eggs- wonderful.  I mean really, really wonderful.  Balsamic Popcorn- soggy and very bitter.  Ravioli- almost store bought flavor and slightly undercooked (sent back and taken off the check- which the servers seemed to handle like it was common).  Tuna- pretty good but needed some salad in each bite to add flavor.  Short ribs- good, but they are short ribs, they have to be good.  Rib-eye 1- ordered rare with demi on the side, delivered medium (pink and fully cooked throughout).  The meat was extremely tough and the only flavor was the smokey flavor from the wood it was cooked over- a cop out in steak preparation.  This may explain the normal plating drenched in demi.  Rib-eye 2- ordered medium and delivered well.  Again, a thin and tough piece of meat.  We are still making jokes about these steaks.  In short, this reminds me of a Dallas or Miami restaurant.  Lots of hype, a very stylish place and beautiful people...but not much to back it up.  Pretty walls and organic ingredients don't automatically create great food.  We will  come back for appetizers and cocktails in this beautiful place, but I won't be in for a \"culinary experience\" unless I hear of some changes."}
{"text":"Great food and service... kids loved the big hall. Will try their Sunday buffet soon as come highly recommended"}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoyed a wonderful dinner here tonight. We started with the scallop and calamari appetizers, that our server recommended to us. They were both extremely good and we knew we were in for a great evening. Our server, Kyla, was very knowledgable and super friendly, as was the front desk staff. For our main course we enjoyed the Lamb Shank for my wife and I had the Short Ribs. Both were very well prepared and thoroughly enjoyable. The ambiance of the location, in an old bank building from the 1920's added to an entirely delightful evening. Everything from the staff, the food, the location to even the valet outside made for a wonderful evening. We can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"My friend and I ate at the  \"chef\" bar ( which is a cool experience- watch the food being cooked and get samples of treats from the menu) here on night and then we returned on many subsequent occasions as the food will pull you back. The plates are generous sizes and the menu is constantly revolving to represent the fresh local ingredients that are the spotlight of each dish. The food is therefore manifestations of delight, simple flavors that highlight the best qualities of their food companions. The last time I ate here I had the lamb and my friend had some kind of game dish, both were quite good. I would love to see what new entrees are featured on their menu tonight."}
{"text":"Had 2 great experiences and one very bad. Found a rock in my food. In a bean dish such as I selected this is a mistake that can happen, as my teeth were fine I was not too upset until the waitress stopped by. Upon casually mentioning their mistake, she stated that it was a peppercorn, I know the flavor and hardness of peppercorns this was certainly not one. The lack of an appropriate response, in addition to several other frustrations they caused that evening, at a restaurant in this price range is not really excusable. The latest dinner will make us think twice before we visit again. Despite great previous visits, this ruined anniversary dinner was a major disappointment!"}
{"text":"I went to Crop for dinner last night for a business meeting as my colleague cannot eat gluten and I thought that this would be a good choice.  WOW, is all I can say, had the calimari app, and the salmon, both absolutely fantastic.  Probably the best salmon I have had all year!  Everything was great!  The vibe of the dining room, the bar, the service was good, not great, but again, the food here is awsome, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I loved loved loved my experience at Crop.  The atmosphere was warm and welcoming and they easily accommodated our party of 8 without a reservation.  Every bite of food was delicious (the Balsamic Popcorn is a must), the service was excellent, and the location was super convenient.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"it's rare that i would give anything five stars because i'm a perfectionist and you know nothing is ever perfect, but this would be difficult to top.  we sat outside to get a beautiful view of downtown cleveland (haha) and listen to a jackhammer all evening. oops. anyway, it didn't really matter because it was a nice night. originally we had attempted to go to sushi rock but it was crowded, loud, full of d-bags and had an hour wait. no thanks. we walked down the street and ended up at crop.  i had the arnold palmer cocktail which is my dream summer libation - lemonade, iced tea, fresh mint, citrus vodka and grand marnier. it was so good, i am going to try and copy it on my own time.  the cornbread and cracked pepper honey butter was very good, though i'm more of a dry cornbread fan than a spongy tiramisu ladyfinger type, but hey, it was free. i ate it regardless so i don't know what i'm really complaining about.  entree wise i had the chicken fried chicken, string beans, bacon and waffle as a tribute to one of my favorite restaurants in atlanta, gladys knight's. this was definitely its high end cousin, but it was very very good. it was an excellent combination of sweet and savory - not too heavy, and the right portion (even though i ended taking some of it home to enjoy it again the next day.) my mom had the summer tart which she raved about the entire time.   not somewhere i'll be often because i can't break the bank, but it is definitely one of the best restaurants i've been to in cleveland and i will be back for more."}
{"text":"I liked our waitress a lot, but the food was just okay. The foie gras appetizer seemed like a good idea (with berries and some other things), but then the sweet sauce almost completely overpowered the taste of the foie. My pasta of the day with shrimp, mushrooms, and vegetables was fine but nothing to write home about. In some ways, the desserts were the most disappointing. The waffles with vanilla ice cream and strawberries were bland, and the ice cream tasted like nothing. I feel like this place mostly uses nice ingredients etc, but it goes for eclectic recipes that it just can't pull off (no complex flavors, etc). My husband liked his scallop appetizer and his dessert consisting of salted caramel, ice cream, and espresso (though also thought the ice cream was bland), but didn't find his entree too interesting-tasting (cherry chipotle ribs and mac and cheese)."}
{"text":"Disappointed.  Service was Meh.  Server did not tell us pasta of the day or specials.  It was Mother's Day - there with the family - not even a Happy Mother's Day - she looked and acted like she would have liked to be anywhere else in the world than serving our table.  Appetizers - we ordered Scallops - which were delicious - but we also ordered pork belly - never came - we had to remind her we ordered it and it came out later.  I had the Rib Eye - which I know is supposed to be marbled in fat - 1/2 my steak was a large wad of disgusting fat that made it unappetizing.  The Braised Short Rib had overbearing flavors and was definitely mis-represented on the menu.  Chicken dish - Crop - why did you change your chicken and waffles?  Everybody loved it.  This dish - half chicken with citrus something or other and a waffle with roasted carrots and parsnips - didn't go together - the flavors made the dish unappetizing - and my daughter had an upset stomach all night from eating it.  Then - dessert - we ordered the Crop Sundae - they forgot the marshmallow cup and as my daughter got toward the bottom of it there was a green leafy lettuce like piece floating in the ice cream - which makes me question where it was prepared and how clean is the work surface they are on?  Sent it back - not feeling so good.  Then at the end - the valet took about 15 minutes to get our car - because he was chasing down a woman to get a tip from her.  Poor taste - and he had a bad attitude.  This is the second poor experience we have had - last time - our food was burnt - yes - burnt.  Come on Crop - at an average of $30 a plate and guests there knowing and willing to pay - step it up - My over $200 bill gave me severe buyers remorse all around."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, the vibe, the architecture, HATE the food. I've been there a few times and go for the \"scene\". It makes me feel like I'm in NY and I love that!! I'm a very picky eater in fairness, but really enjoy eating out and have no problems leaving feeling very satisfied. This place, food-wise, just does not do it for me. In each occasion I've been there, the people I was with also were disappointed with their meals. That said, I'd go back (eat a salad)  for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"We arrived a bit before 6 pm for happy hour and dinner. We were seated  on the couch in the bar as there weren't 2 seats together at the bar. 2 bartenders and 2 waitstaff were on duty. After 5 minutes we tried to order at the bar. The bartender assured us someone would be right over to get our order. After another 15 minutes of being pointed ignored by the waitstaff (1 had time to go chat up the 4 girls at the hostess station while ignoring us) we left. I  have no idea how the food or drinks are as 20+ minutes of not so much as a hi or glass of water, we took our business elsewhere. Note the restaurant proper had 1 table occupied. The hostess tried to save the day by saying they would now make an exception to happy hour only at the bar for us but the mood had been totally spoilt .Maybe poor service is why this gorgeous venue was empty."}
{"text":"I just want to start by saying I never leave bad reviews, but in this cause I felt like I had to.  This was one of the worst meals I have ever eaten.  My wife had the scallops and shrimp, it was so salty that you couldn't even eat it.  I had the lamb and it was awful, it looked like country fried lamb, if there was such a thing. Not to mention that the lamb was mostly fat, hardly editable. I told the server that both of the meals were no good and he didn't do anything to accommodate us, not that I needed anything else but a simple gesture would have been appropriate.  I should've have known when I was the only one in the restaurant that it wasn't going to be good."}
{"text":"I booked a table here looking for something interesting and I can confidently say that i found it.  First, let's talk about the atmosphere. This is an old bank space that was renovated into a restaurant, so you get unique architecture (including 2+ story ceilings) and a wide open space that is refreshingly different (in a good way). The setting itself is enough to fuel a good amount of conversation, and that's before the food or drinks get there.  The food is superb, and has it's own style, different from any of the other places nearby.  Their utilization of local ingredients to make these impressive dishes is a welcome feature. Everything is fresh, and absolutely delicious.  The staff were great, and really helped navigate the options and wine pairings.   If you're looking for great modern american cuisine, all with a refreshingly unique atmosphere, then look no further."}
{"text":"My wife and I had been to Crop 3 years ago and had an excellent overall experience. We decided to go again last night with friends and had a much different experience.   1. The coldest in door restaurant I've ever been in. I understand the age and size of the building presents difficulties but it was literally under 60 degrees. 2. Subpar service from un-interested staff.  3. Small menu and were out of 2 entrees. 4. Food was okay, taking into consideration the price you would expect more.   For these reasons we won't be heading back to Crop."}
{"text":"Seriously one of the most beautiful restaurants in Cleveland. It's breathtaking! The service is always top notch, and their happy hour is awesome. I always enjoy my infrequent stops here. I need to start making it over here more often..."}
{"text":"A must in Cleveland.   I was in town for business and went for lunch.  I had such a good experience I went back for dinner.  I ate at Lola the night before and Crop is better.  Simple ingredents and very tasty food.  Be sure to sit at the kitchen bar-Steve and the guys in the kitchen are great."}
{"text":"Crop isn't all that it is talked up to be.  The atmosphere is nice but simply too loud to have a conversation.  The service is great.  On our visit the food was just ok.  Maybe it was an off night...  but for the price I expected much more."}
{"text":"Crop is a must taste for downtown Cleveland. Start with the cherry bomb or the balsamic popcorn and check out the chicken and waffles or the mustard crusted lamb. Our server was knowledgeable and nice. The wine this is fantastic. Really cool atmosphere for drinks or dinner."}
{"text":"Try the Truffled Egg Salad sandwich on Brioche. Holy God in Heaven, was it ever good!"}
{"text":"When I hear \"bistro\" I think of a small place, but Crop Bistro's main room was a wow when we walked in: a big open space in a vintage bank building, complete with stone columns, arched windows and high coffered ceiling. The cocktails included savory and sweet, and the server was very helpful with wine selections.  Our group shared a cheese board. The menu included imported and domestic, cow, sheep and goat's milk selections so we each could pick flavors that appealed. The plate included toasted hazelnuts, two kinds of preserves and pickled vegetables.  My entree was fresh walleye - a slab so large I couldn't finish it all - on corn risotto. The fish was perfectly cooked - crispy skin and flaky, moist, tender meat. The cheesy risotto with kernels of fresh sweet corn was the right consistency and a nice accompaniment.  Crop Bistro is in Ohio City, a short cab ride from downtown and well worth the trip."}
{"text":"After reviewing several reviews on Yelp, my girlfriend and I decided to give Crop a try and had some relatively high expectations, which were definitely met. I really enjoyed the decor and openness of the restaurant. We arrived at 5:30 and had a reservation so we didn't really have to wait for our table but there is the bar, a few tables around the bar and a large open area to stand and have a drink (which I'd definitely recommend) if you have to wait. The two cocktails I had, an Old Fashion and Manhatten, and the one my girlfriend had, Le Fizz, were great!   For dinner we ordered the grilled flatbread for an appetizer and then I ordered the ribeye and she the pork chop with the grits for an entree. All of the food was presented well, contained decent portion sizes and was flavorful. The server was very attentive, came by our table often and was able to recommend popular dishes and drinks off of the menus.   The reason I didn't give Crop 4 stars was because I ordered a bowl of the lobster bisque, which was on special, and they failed to bring it out to me. By the time I noticed it wasn't coming out, our food was about to be brought to us and it wasn't worth getting the bowl as it would take up too much room on the table. Also, an additional negative is that the restaurant itself is somewhat hard to spot from the street (they have a beige overhang outside). Although I didn't get the soup and the restaurant was slightly hard to spot from the street, it was a great experience! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We came here for an early dinner a week or two ago. First of all, the building and atmosphere are breathtaking! Gorgeous setting. Our service was impeccable until the end when things got busy and we had to wait over a half hour to check out (we were content with conversation and water in the meantime but it would have been nice to not feel trapped there) The food was incredible, I had a super tender duck, my companions had a pumpkin pasta and the crop pasta. We also got the cheese board and deviled eggs. All of the food was delicious and there was a lot of it! Well worth the price. I would come back here for a nice date."}
{"text":"Crop was better than advertised. I had never been to the old location so I cant compare the two.  Great bar, with an excellent selection of craft beers on draft, and a nice drink menu. The appetizer was timely and tasted delicious. Probably the best calamari I have ever had. The bread with the honey infused butter was worth the trip alone. Our service was great with a very casual feel from everyone. it is not an up-tight place although the food would rival any traditional \"blue blood restaurant.\" My \"Ohio Ribeye\" was cooked to perfection and incredibly tender. Even the Brussels sprouts tasted good.... How'd they do that! To top it all off we were taken on a tour of the old bank vault in the basement. What a cool experience.  I will be returning to crop sooner than later!"}
{"text":"We went to Crop for a friend's 30th birthday in a party of 10.  What could have been an unpleasant night was turned into a great night by the staff.  Our reservation was for 7:15 pm and by 7:45 we still had not been sat.  It was explained to us that the group seated at our table was enjoying a leisurely dinner and still had not ordered dessert.  Needless to say, we were getting a bit testy as the hunger settled in, but a moment after our conversation with the hostess we were greeted by someone who I would consider to be the manager.  He explained the situation to us, apologized, and asked if we could wait another 10- 15 minutes for a table.  We agreed and he picked up our round of drinks! So we waited and we were eventually taken to a table that had clearly been set up just for us.  The rest of the night went great.  Lovely staff, good food, and the manager even sent over an appetizer tasting for us!  All in all, the delayed seating was just a small footnote on an otherwise great experience!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour Review!  I came here on a Thursday for happy hour. They have plenty of sitting at the bar so no need to rush it (but it ends at 6:30pm so maybe rush it a little bit). The cocktails are really creative and amazing flavors. This is not your typical vodka soda happy hour but the drinks are $7 which is pricy considering that most happy hours are $5. Your palate will appreciate it those extra dollars though. The food is a bargain! Every dish is $5 and you get the famous cherry bomb, the flavored popcorn and my two favorites: bbq pork pizza and a great serving size of calamaris. My friends also had he sliders and they really liked them but I was too full to try.  The service is 5starts even though is a happy hour and the sitting accommodations feel like fine dining on a dime. I would recommend this happy hour to any happy hour hunter out there.... Although I was feeling more like keeping it to myself but the experience was awesome so my heart told me to not be selfish.  I came here for lunch once but I don't remember my dish been as memorable as the happy hour experience.  I am going to give it a try for dinner soon."}
{"text":"A great downtown Cleveland Restaurant located in a wonderfully renovated old bank. I had the CAB Ribeye which was done to perfection...well aged, medium rare, tender and juicy.  My wife had the Grilled Veal Chop which she thoroughly enjoyed. Our servers were very knowledgeable and friendly. We'll definitely be back to explore a bit more of their menu."}
{"text":"Went to Crop for dinner on Friday night for my birthday with my husband.  We had reservations for 8:30, arrived about 10 minutes early , and were seated right away.  Our waiter, whose name I think was DJ, was awesome.  Friendly, attentive, knowledgeable, we could not have asked for better service.    Obviously, as everyone else has noted, the place is incredibly beautiful.  Walking by and peeking in the windows was the sole reason we decided to eat here, and we weren't disappointed once we got inside.  We spent several minutes in silence just looking around.  The high ceilings do make it a little bit loud though.  The look  and the prices on the menu made us think it was a dressy kind of place, but that didn't seem to be the case.  My husband had on a shirt and tie, and I wore a dress and heels, and we both felt a bit over-dressed compared to everyone else.  I was also a little suprised to see the televisions in the bar area, which you can also see from most of the dining room as it's pretty open.  I guess people at the bar appreciate it, but again, just not really the atmosphere we were expecting.  I will second someone else's comment about being disappointed by the bathrooms.  Not that there was anything particularly wrong with them, but they just didn't seem to match the grand scale of the restaurant.    The food was mostly great.  We had deviled eggs and cherry bombs as appetizers.  Both exceeded our expectations, and my husband said the cherry bombs were his favorite part of the meal.  I was looking forward to trying the lobster and mango lettuce cups that I saw on the online menu, but they weren't available.  He had the fried pork chop (with cheese grits, chorizo gravy, and braised swiss chard), which was my favorite thing from the meal.  That chorizo gravy was outstanding.  I had the grilled Tasmanian salmon (with crab risotto croquette, arugala, and mango chutney), which was not as good.  The salmon was excellently cooked, but that's the best I can say for the dish.  The crab cake was larger than I expected, but also cakier than I expected.  The mango chutney was very sweet and overwhelmed everything else.  I wouldn't say it was bad, but I also wouldn't order it again, even for half the price.  For dessert we had the pretzel unlogic and the crop tarts.  Both were very good.  Overall it was a good experience and I would be happy to go back."}
{"text":"I can understand how the cozy and intimate space has been, and will be, missed. But in my eyes, the new location is modern, innovative, and just beautiful. And, most importantly, the quality of most of the dishes has not skipped a beat.  Derek and I returned to Crop recently to partake of a Sunday supper. We did NOT have the kids! YAAAAAAY (um, can you tell I've been cooped up in the house too long with a newborn?). While I kinda wished I'd had the opportunity to linger over the regular menu and take forever to make my decision, it was fine to have just the options of the dishes they were serving that night for $30/person.  For a cocktail, I had the porch swing. Weeeeee! Drunk after 2 sips. We had the truffle popcorn which was a little weird in my opinion. The popcorn wasn't crunchy, just kind of chewy. Normal? I don't know; I'd never tried their balsamic popcorn either.   We had a huge, colorful, tasty salad (they called it their \"Late Summer Salad\"). It had golden and red beets, grapes, melon, arugula, and more. It was delicious and plentiful! My only criticism would be that it was a little overdressed with what the server referred to as \"Balsamic Vin\" -- LOL.  For our entrees, Derek had the cherry-braised short ribs served with cornbread and I had the pappardelle with a mushroom sauce.  Derek said that his was a bit vinegary, but overall he liked it a lot. I was in love with the pasta and the sauce's flavor, but the mushrooms in the dish were HUGE and I am not too down with that. I prefer my mushrooms chopped up a little more -- that is probably declasse. Whatever!  The sides were smashed potatoes and ratatouille. Both were fine. Nothing to write home about, and actually the potatoes needed a little seasoning.  Dessert was a pumpkin pie-type-thing, which was AWESOME and served with dried cranberries and some kind of sugared pecans or something of that nature. Mmm. The reason I enjoy this meal in general is that it allows you to try things you ordinarily wouldn't. I was so glad to be \"forced\" to eat this pumpkin dessert, because when given the chance I'd have probably gone with something chocolate in nature.  The only complaint I had about this was that we were never offered coffee with our dessert, and then the bill was just placed on the table before we could ask. Do they not serve coffee for Sunday Supper -- anybody know?  Service was great, as usual. The four star rating is just because we didn't ABSOLUTELY LOVE our meals this time like the other times.   I don't really think that the space is too big. It's just that the sound isn't absorbed by the velvet couches, etc. anymore that makes it seem so vast in there. That, and the ridiculously tall ceiling, which is actually a great feature because of the artistic design of the ceiling. The space really is a work of art, as is the food. Instead of thinking of what has been, consider Crop Bistro to be a really great place right NOW. And it will probably only get better."}
{"text":"I took client to this restaurant recently reservations were easy to get and the wait staff was pleasant. Our server had very little experience with the menu and struggled to make recommendations. Our food and drinks were excellent but a bit on the pricey side for the amount and quality. Overall I gave it three stars for the inexperienced staff as compared to the price"}
{"text":"Excellent food. I tend to like the lunch menus better than the dinner. Awesome atmosphere and lovely staff! Menus are very different & seasonal. Love the salmon BLT!"}
{"text":"I can only comment on the happy hour, but WOW. This place has one of the best happy hours in all of Cleveland.  First of all, Crop is inside of a building that was once a bank. The high ceiling with intricate artwork and design make the atmosphere unique for dining.  Mixed drinks were $7, but well worth the price. The bourbon barrel aged-gin was fantastic. Honestly one of the best drinks I've had in a long time. The curry-infused gin drink was unlike anything I've had before and was thirst quenching. The reason I didn't give Crop 5 stars was that the other drinks didn't quite measure up.  They serve $5 small plates, and by small plates they actually mean very sizable portioned-plates. The flatbread prosciutto pizza was excellent, the duck wings were simply scrumptious and the calamari was declicious. Great service and ample seating made for a HH I can't wait to return to!"}
{"text":"Drinks - The drinks here were 4/5 stars.  I started with the Mr. Figgy which I thought was pretty great.  I usually shy away from whiskey drinks but this preparation really shows how to do it right.  Next I had a pear drink which was also phenomenal.  Wife had Applewood Punch and My Darling Clementine and she really seemed to like both.  Drinks are on the pricey side at around $10 each, but excellent.  Appetizers - We got the truffled popcorn and pork belly.  I'd recommend both of them.  The popcorn made for a nice little snack - maybe if you were just going for drinks or something.  The pork belly was meatier than I've had in some other places and the sauce it came in was awesome.  Dinner - Now here is where it fell apart for us.  I got the short ribs which were OK but nothing special.  They were tender as they should be but I think the dish really needed some more flavor contrasts.  My wife got the lamb shank and it was truly horrible.  On paper the cinnamon demi really sounds interesting but when you are eating it all you can taste is cinnamon.  For two we walked away spending $140 so I really expect excellence overall at that price point.  I would not recommend this place for dinner."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic birthday dinner for my boyfriend there last night.  We have been meaning to go to Crop for dinner for some time, and finally used his birthday as the perfect excuse for a nice dinner.  We made reservations, which we rarely do, and I am glad we did.  The place was packed by 7:00.    Our server was good.  She started out a lot more attentive and that dwindled as the night went on, but we're pretty easy. So, I don't blame her for taking care of the tables of old rich folks sitting by us.  However, when we were ready to leave, she seemed to enjoy skipping visiting our table.  I would probably give them 5 stars had she kept up with our table.  Regardless, the dinner was AMAZING.  We had the flatbread appetizer (huge & delish).  Boyfriend had the quail, which he really enjoyed.  I am a vegetarian, and they are great at accomodating.  I had grilled tofu with the sides that accompany the salmon, and it was absolutely fantastic.  I wish more places offered something like that!  The atmosphere in there is great.  There is so much to look at.  I thought with it being so massive, it would feel cold, but it really didn't.  It was a little loud, but I prefer that over quiet and sterile.    Overall, I was incredibly impressed.  I had heard good things, and it definitely exceeded my expectations."}
{"text":"Crop or crap Sorry that's just the way I feel after eating there 20 minutes ago Went due to all of the great reviews, it sounded great Ist my drink, ordered a Manhattan i assumed that it would be made with sweet vermouth instead it was dry, maybe I was just expecting too much After the drink was sat at a table ordered some apps the foie gras was ok if you like 2 quarter size pieces with way to much cherries, but at least it wasn't over cooked the pork belly was bad, it was fresh but so tough you couldn't cut it. Usually this app is so tender you can cut it with a fork, then comes the \"cherry bomb\" are you kidding me a tomato stuffed with chorizo and fried,BLAND watery just unacceptable  Here come the entrees I had the short ribs, when I order them from a high end restaurant I expect a substantial cut of meat this was like 2 pieces 1/4 of an inch thick with some horseradish squiggles on top and served on top of some cold barley, the flavor wasn't bad just wimpy  the chicken and waffles was a joke, again the chicken was 2 pieces of breast both not much more than a 1/4 inch dry seemed to be precooked if you have ever had this dish done right (the feed store atlanta) you'll know what I mean  Now desserts the best was the pretzel logic though it has nothing to do with pretzels the next was the\" some like it hot \"the flour less chocolate tasted like it was pre made with cheap chocolate  then the cropper nutter more like the crapper nutter the Toasted Crème Fraiche Cake, tasted like bad coffee cake made I don't know? last week The best thing about the place was the server, professional attentive and capable without that this would have been a one star disaster   There is no love in this food SKIP IT!!"}
{"text":"World class bar with great wait staff.  Food was wonderful, fresh, local ingredients and perfectly prepared.  Reasonable prices a good value.   The setting in 100year old bank is perfect"}
{"text":"Crop is always a five star experience.  Last night was delicious as always.   We started with the balsamic popcorn which can't be missed. We get this every time because it is so fabulous with wine (Martinelli syrah last night). The wine list is excellent.   We always find something amazing and many times it's something that is a rare find.   My entree was the duck, duck, chicken which was a perfectly cooked duck breast with a sweet potato, bacon and duck confit hash topped with an egg. Sooooo good. My husband had the chicken confit which was served with celery root purée and carrots. Also very delicious.   We've been skipping dessert lately but you can't do that at Crop since they have the best desserts in town. They desserts are quite unique. We had the cropper nutter and basically licked the plate.   And service is always a big part of the evening. Our server, Doreen, was excellent. She was smart, just attentive enough, and spaced the courses perfectly.   My only issue with Crop is the cavernous feel of the very large space. We preferred the old space, but of course we will continue to come back."}
{"text":"I had dinner at Crop with a friend tonight. This location is a renovated bank building and very beautiful! We had a variety of menu items...wine, appetizer, salad and entree. All were very tasty. Loved my tamarind glazed salmon filet, stir fry vegetables and basmati rice...so yummy! Service was excellent. I highly recommend this upscale and high end restaurant in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Went to Crop Saturday night with my family and had very high expectations based on other reviews and what I had heard from friends. Although the actual venue  is really cool and unique the food was a major disappointment.   We had a nice, attentive waiter and food came out quickly but everything we had was average or below. We started with the calamari and cherry bombs (a tomato stuffed with chorizo and cheese in a fried won-ton) and as a main I had the rib-eye. The appetizers were bland and unexciting, my actual steak was ok but the side it was served with (hogans peas) was more of a cream soup with hard peas in it. I love peas but this dish didn't seem like it was made correctly. I tried my brothers chicken which was dry and had a marmalade flavoring that I did not care for, and my boyfriends salmon, which was also dry, but served over a nice, flavorful bed of rice.  I like to think I have mature taste buds but the dessert was REALLY out there. We ordered a tropical meringue dessert which was ok, but our chocolate dessert had a lot of salty flavoring to it, and not the tasty kind. It almost tasted like it was paired with Gorgonzola cheese. Overall, very bizarre desserts and not recommended.   I would try Crop again, but maybe for lunch (or with lower expectations).  **side note-since the building is an old bank you can ask for a tour of the vault downstairs (they also have private events down there). We were given the tour and it was really cool to see."}
{"text":"Another outstanding experience.  This time we sat at the Chef's table which is actually a long bar alongside the open kitchen.  Watch everything be prepared and plated in front of you.  Chef Schimoler even brought us a chef's tasting of an heirloom tomato with fresh mozzarella and a drizzle of balsamic vinegar.  Fresh and delicious!  The new scallops appetizer seems to be the most popular right now.  The Balsamic popcorn is incredible...I just wish they would remove the damn unpopped kernels!  The special was walleye and flicking awesome.  I went with the usual stuff I order...deviled eggs and beet salad.  We even got a tour of the basement from Sous Chef David which was really neat to see the vault and the prep kitchen.  Always a first class experience at Crop."}
{"text":"I find it hard to believe that I haven't written a review of this spot yet, because i LOVE it SO much.  Let me start by saying - when my boss asks me where I want to go to lunch the answer will forever and always be \"Crop.\"  In fact, now he just assumes, no question asked.  So many yummy menu items, among my faves: truffled egg salad sliders, and salmon BLT!    My heart sinks a bit when I think of this place moving across the river, only because it won't be in such close walking distance.  But, good for them - more space!"}
{"text":"Very elegant place across from the West Side Market.  In an old bank lobby.  It was a lazy Monday night in June.  The place was half full, and that was good for us.  When this place is full it has to be booming loud and hard to hear.  The main reason is the 30 foot, my estimate, ceilings in what was once the lobby, a very elegant lobby, of a bank.  Keep that in mind if you go on a Saturday night.  Everything was very good.  The food.  The food selection.  The servers.  Food prep.  Bathroom cleanliness.  All very good.  My main complaint is the place is unnecessarily expensive.  The food prices seem about 5$ too much per dish, and the wine markup is at the very top end.  So are the drink prices, but the pour is generous, not great, but above the average pour.  All in all a great time, but next time we'll experience something else in this newly minted part of Cleveland."}
{"text":"I have come here twice and the food is just outstanding. Both times my boyfriend got the ribeye because it is so good. The first time I got the seasonal pasta and it was a meat bolognese and it was so creamy and good. This time I got the lamb and it was very tender. I saved room for desert and got the croppy road sundae, I highly recommend. Of course you should expect to pay some money to eat here but it is worth every penny"}
{"text":"The dishes are so unique and you can taste how fresh everything is. It wasn't a cheap dinner by any means but the food is so creative and delicious that it was worth every penny. The open kitchen is a very nice touch and the restaurant's atmosphere is very cozy. We went there on a rainy cold Friday night and eating dinner at Crop made me forget about the weather outside....had a fabulous night!"}
{"text":"Starting with the specialty cocktails and ending with a fois gras dessert this was truly an exceptional dining experience. The lamb loin melts in your mouth. You can tell the chef has a true passion for his job and puts forth that extra effort to exceed expectations. Really great and different combination of flavors, not the standard fare. One of my top five dining experiences ever, and I'm old."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. The new location is beautiful, though a bit noisy. I am partial to the tasting menu - nothing has disappointed me. Getting the wine pairings really enhances the experience, but is not cheap and will require a cab ride home!"}
{"text":"Food and service were excellent! The architecture inside was beautiful. Only downside when the restaurant was packed is that it is VERY loud. We had to shout to talk across the table. But definitely worth dining here. Absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"The food was fantastic. There were 9 of us- and every single person walked away more than satisfied. The food and service was above expectations. Highly recommended for work, romance or fun."}
{"text":"Had a reservation for our anniversary here and all started out okay. We arrived a little early and were led to our table. Great, except that was the end of our experience. We waited for 35 minutes for a server to come to our table and no one ever did. We never even received a drink menu. I did have a very lovely serving fork at my place setting though so we were not without laughs while waiting. We finally decided to leave to find dinner elsewhere. 2 stars for the beautiful space."}
{"text":"See that photo hyperlink next to the date of my review? Stop reading and click on it. Look; no stare. No, staring isn't rude... but, drooling is.   And what the hell is it? The Park Farms Fried Chicken and Waffle dish with spiced savory maple syrup and buttered broccoli.  G.L.O.R.I.O.U.S.              I can also vouch for the decidedly divine balsamic popcorn and for the grand gesture of a finish, the Pretzel Un-Logic dessert. With a pretzel crust as its base and malted whipped cream on top, I've already forgotten about the innards... oh wait, I saw chocolate. Lots and lots of chocolate!  The space itself deserves its own paragraph... the restaurant is housed in a restored bank building and the contrast of rustic menu and gleaming, borderline ostentatious environs make for interesting juxtaposition. If you have any doubts, just take a few moments to eyeball the vaulted ceilings. Magnificent, yes?  It is. And I can't wait to come back for another taste of greatness."}
{"text":"Calamari was too salty could not even finish it. Salmon was nothing out of the ordinary. Had the glat bread and it was gross. The prices for the quality of food is crazy. Fro an appetizer and entree it was $70 - would have rahter had some steak somewhere. Unfortunately had no choice since we were there for a birthday dinner."}
{"text":"Drinks were amazing! Had the smoked ribeye, awesome. The lamb was fall off the bone quality. Pork and salmon were amazing.  Also had a tour led by the hostess. She was amazing with the early 1920s history with the vault and other spaces."}
{"text":"Really good seafood, tasty cocktails. Service was a little slow despite being mostly empty on a Monday night and the rib eye I got was average. From what I gather, it's a great restaurant for the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"Nom nom nom this place is great! I went here for my friend's birthday, and I was not disappointed. I usually don't get TOO into the whole artisan/ fancy food scene, because I have a big appetite and a small budget, but this place was good.   I started the night with a few cocktails. First, I had the Mistletoe Margarita. I can't remember specifically what was in it, but it literally tasted like Christmas. So fantastic. I will say, it was a little strong. So strong, in fact, that against my better judgement I ordered another drink. This time, it was the baked apple. This too was delicious, and not as strong.  Someone got a balsamic popcorn to share with the table, and it was pretty good. I would get that again, especially considering that the complimentary bread and butter was very MEH. I ordered the short rib wellington, which was fantastic. However, it wasn't really like beef wellington because it didn't have any pate, which was a little disappointing. The sauce that came with it was awesome though. My bf got the pork chop, and it was fantastic (he kept bragging about how he has a talent for ordering the best thing on the menu, not that hard LOL). The pork chop came with some sortof cheesy grits that tasted amazing.   Overall, I had a great experience here. I left full and happy, and the service and ambiance was great (not that I care too much about that stuff). I'd come back for a special occasion, because it is a little pricey and fancy for everyday dining."}
{"text":"Tough review to apply stars to.    Atmosphere, food, drinks, were all fantastic.   Prices seemed fair.   Service was odd, unhelpful, snobbish and borderline rude.    I'm behind on this review timing as we were there in Nov. so I no longer remember our female servers name.   We had a table of 3 and our third arrived about 10 mins late.   We had a very early reservation, about 5:45 so the place was empty to start.   Our server asked if we wanted to order drinks I said yes but needed a min to look over the drink menu....which is very creative and I think changes.  She took my order then our friend joined us who hadnt even taken her coat off or sat, the server interrupted to ask if she wanted a drink.  My friend said she would but needed to look at the menu.   Server hands her a menu and then stands there to 'wait\" so my friend hurried and made a decision.  Drinks were tasty, I noticed they took care all the way around, color, texture, taste and smell!    Our server stopped by more than once to ask if we were ready to order and we finally felt pressured so said we could order apps and salad courses but weren't decided on main course yet.    Now any other place this is acceptable type pace for dining.   Not at Crop.   She patronizingly informed us the kitchen has to ave the entire order at once so we needed to decide.   Now we had been sitting at our table maybe 5 mins once our third joined so this was rather surprising to be so rushed, let alone the odd \"rule\".    It's interesting to me that the server and the kitchen cannot work together to time a tables' meals properly so we aren't required to place the entire order at once.   The food was delicious, we enjoyed the popcorn.   Our server was consistently pretentious all evening.    Can't say we will be back with SO many choices in the area.   Maybe we'd sit at the bar and have just one course to not deal with the \"kitchen rule\"."}
{"text":"The new location is jaw-dropping.  So is the food.  The seared tuna with cous cous was one of the best dishes I have ever had."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Probably one of my favorite dinners ever. I had the salmon and it was absolutely delicious!! The drink selection was unique and fun and the service was excellent. Love! The sound is awful in there so it's not good for large groups..."}
{"text":"The fact remains that 1 terrible experience will outweigh any number of good experiences and I am proving that today.  I have had some great meals here but most recently we went and it was a huge miss and I'll never be back again.   One of us has a lactose and wheat allergy. The last time we went to Crop they were extremely accommodating. This time, not so much. They told her that you could not do substitutes for anything on the menu so she basically had 2 choices to eat.  The salmon or the salmon.   Next, my girlfriend ordered the special which, we were told by our waitress, was crab cakes. After some inquiring about how they were prepared she even went as far as to show us how big they were with her using the shape if a circle with her fingers. Well, she was lying because when the food came it wasn't crab cakes after all. It was tempura deep fried soft shell crab. Our waitress didn't even catch this an just placed the dish on the table. When we called it out she said \"oh whoops, that's not what you ordered\". I honestly don't think she even knew what a crab cake vs. soft shell crab was.  When I explained that this wasn't what was ordered she kind of blew it off and said \"I'll take something off your bill\". ...ummm. But what about dinner?? We decided just to deal with it and that was a mistake because it was terrible.  Really greasy and tons of tempura.   It was three couples at dinner and the guys at the table can typically put a few back. Well, not tonight. We were asked once when we got there what we wanted to drink and that was the last drink we got.   I decided to talk to the manager after our meal just to explain what happened because I felt he should know. Well he blew me off too. Just said, \"okay, we'll take the soft shell crab off the bill\". Never apologized. Never came over to the table to say sorry. Never saw him again.   Two stars just because I have had good meals here in the past. But, that's history, because I won't be stepping foot in here ever again."}
{"text":"Very cool place in downtown Cleveland.  Kind of reminds me of Farmhouse in Kansas City but with more variety.  Started with the popcorn, which is hard to describe but really amazing.  They have the recipe on the website so you should try it.  Would make great cocktail party snack.  Also had the fig and swiss flatbread that was perfectly prepared, unique and tasty.  Amazingly, I wasn't in the mood for seafood, which is what I normally choose when on the road.  I went for the slow cooked ribs and they were a good choice but a little heavier than I usually eat when traveling.  Didn't finish them but they were solid.   There are lots of items on the menu that look amazing and when I go again I will make some other choices.  The main reason I give it 4 stars is that it had a great atmosphere, great wine list that was priced reasonably, the service was outstanding and every dish I tasted or saw was somewhat unique and perfectly prepared."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Crop.  The first time was with a group of friends and we stayed at the bar.  Like others have said, the atmosphere and decor was what initially caught my eye.  The same goes for the bartenders.  Great service and attire.  The drinks are a little pricey, but definitely worth a stop in. My second appearance was for a nice dinner after recommendations from my bar night.  The menu caters more towards meat eaters, but the waitress gladlly discussed vegetarian options.  My dish was better than expected and I'd love to go back again if there were more meatless choices.  Although, I will be making another stop because I enjoy the chance to wear something classy and the building is just awesome."}
{"text":"Whether you're a savvy local, a solo business traveler, or a foodie from afar, Crop is a great destination, just across the street from the amazing West Side Market & sharing a stately re-purposed bank (check out the vault in the basement) with Penzey's Spice.   Pete, Ryan & the rest of the crew make you feel welcome with good cheer, unobtrusive service, delicious cocktails & amuse bouches & pitch-perfect entrees. Recent winners included burrata & tomatoes that fired all my \"summer\" neurons, gazpacho garnished with micro greens, mac & short ribs (umami bomb), & \"all in\" burger with foie gras & caramelized onions. Don't miss the spectacular desserts, made by a Michelin 2 star veteran. I've been here twice in 2 days & only wish I could bring them to my home towns of San Francisco & Abu Dhabi :-)"}
{"text":"Came for lunch with my parents. The building and history behind the place is beautiful. Old bank building incredible architecture. Food was good- smallish lunch menu but everything we had tasted fresh. I had the braised Mac and cheese and the cheese wasn't too overly cheesy or heavy.  Would like to come back and try dinner"}
{"text":"This place has an amazing atmosphere, and the food is upscale and tasty. Worth the price. You can see my complete review on my blog: http://bit.ly/1mxAOuM"}
{"text":"I went with four girlfriends to brunch on Sunday, March 13, 2017. We were seated quickly and were greeted by a waiter and were offered coffee quickly. We told them we were waiting for one more person and after that we didn't quite see the waiter at all. We were interested in the brunch but not sure if we should just help ourselves, so we asked a bus boy and we enjoyed the beautiful brunch, but needed extras like omelettes, melted butter, Tabasco sauce and salt-and-pepper and had no service. We talked to the manager twice and he ended up serving our table. The brunch was beautifully set up with wonderful options including many seafood options and fresh fruit. But on this day our service was terrible."}
{"text":"Love it! Dinner here was excellent and the service was terrific!  Our group ordered all of the appetizers and each one was really good.  We even shared the Mushroom Cappucino, it was a great conversation booster and provided a lot of laughs.  Everyone enjoyed their dinner - chicken & waffles, ribeyes, and my personal favorite the special - angel hair pasta, cream sauce, scallops, apples, and bacon - YUM!  The desserts were delicious too!  I had the chocolate cake!  It hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Wow. Wow. Wow. Sunday supper!  I went with a date on a whim one Sunday evening. The place had a beautiful atmosphere. No reservation, but we were seated promptly.  I was impressed with the vast beer selection -- they had old favorites and mysterious microbrews. I was also surprised at how large the selection of entrees was for a prix fixe dinner.  After his first bite, my date's eyes got all bug-eyed. He put his fork down and paused dramatically, \"This is the best thing I've ever eaten.\"  I must go back and try the traditional menu. But in the meantime: salad, steak, peas, potatoes and pumpkin crisp for $25. Wow."}
{"text":"Our party of three had a reservation for 8:45 on a Friday night.  We were seated around 9 pm.  This, along with the very noisy atmosphere areTHE only reasons this isn't five stars. Service was timely but not rushed. Clean silverware was provided in between each course. We began with a round of beverages. Tully's Pick-Me-Up was a refreshingly light Irish cream beverage. For appetizers we shared seared scallops and their signature balsalmic popcorn. The group agreed they were fantastic. The seared scallop appetizer consisted of two large tender scallops on a thick sweet corn griddle cake.Check out their web page for their balsalmic popcorn recipe. It is a unique, satisfying treat!  My entree was lamb tenderloin atop couscous and ratatouille.  The lamb was cooked lightly pink and was fork tender. The ratatouille of fresh local vegetables was comfortably warm and the perfect complement.  The other entrees in our party were quail and crop pasta. Neither of which disappointed  Overall this is a top-notch restaurant and we just can't stop talking about it. Would definitely visit again when in Cleveland."}
{"text":"A friend was visiting us for the weekend, so we wanted to make his Cleveland experience extra special.  We drew us into crop was the chance to sit at the Chef's Table AND the \"Tour de Crop\" option which allows you to sample seven courses for $65.  That's a pretty damn good deal, if you ask me.  Our meal began with their infamous popcorn.  While I have heard of using a balsamic reduction on popcorn, I never would have thought to put sauteed peppers in it, too.  Very original and very tasty.  And this didn't even count as one of our courses.  We didn't know what we were getting ourselves into.  Next up was their delicious bread (made with rosemary and cheese) with a healthy side of butter infused with honey.  I judge restaurants on the bread they serve, and Crop succeeded admirably.  The bread also did not count as one of our courses.  The real meal began with the Lobster Latte.  I think \"wow\" pretty much sums up this dish.  It's rich without being heavy, and full of buttery-delicious flavor.  They don't skimp on the lobster, either, even with our reduced portion sizes for the tour.  From what I could tell from watching the chefs at work, they keep a healthy stock of the broth ready to go, but they prepare the lobster right before they serve the latte.  So now rubbery, overcooked lobster to worry about.  It tasted perfectly fresh.  Course two was trout (the only dish we had that was not available on the regular menu).  It was served on top of green beans with almondine sauce.  This was my favorite dish by far.  I wish I could describe this dish better.  The third course was scallops, and boy did we get lucky here.  The chef explained that they recent got an order of scallops, and lucky for us, three scallops were to big to serve as part of their regular menu.  The scallops we were served are called \"sixes\" because there are six per pound; normally they serve \"eights\" in the restaurant. I have never, ever seen a scallop this huge before.  I'm not a big fan of scallops because of their texture, but this was probably one of the best-prepared scallops I have ever had.  It was served with crisp polenta and corn and sundried tomato sauce.  It was beautifully executed.  Course four was a salad made of bibb lettuce, poached pear, julienned apples, cranberries, blue cheese, and candied pecans.  I eat salad almost every day of the week and I could only wish that the salads I make tasted remotely like this.  Again, the chefs showcased their talents for making so many ingredients compliment each other so well.  Before the fifth course came out, we were presented with the Cropsicle to cleanse our palates.  This actually provided a nice reprieve from food in the middle of our tasting.  By this point we were all already quite full and welcome a bit of a break from solid foods.  The popsicle was different than anything else I have ever tasted.  When course five arrived, we were greeted with New Zealand lamb, babaganoush couscous, tzatziki sauce, and toasted almonds topped with fried filo.  THis was my first time eating lamb, which while good, was not my favorite (I'm not really a fan of red meats).  I did however love the couscous because it had a nice bite to it.  Both of my dining partners agreed that this was our least favorite course.  By course six we all wanted to curl up into a little ball and take a nap because we were so stuffed.  No reprieve for us!  The chefs presented us with the pot roast short ribs served with braised root vegetables, pearl onions and herb jus.  Again, not being a huge fan of red meat, this was not my favorite dish, but it was still REALLY good.  My inner carnivore loved how juicy and tender the beef was (it literally fell off the bone).  The root vegetables were sadly understated on the plate.  Despite how full I was, I wish we had a larger sampling of the veggies.  Obviously, our final course was dessert.  They served us their \"waffles and ice cream\" which is comprised of a hot waffle topped with cinnamon ice cream and whipped cream with bruleed bananas on the side, all drizzled with rum syrup.  Despite the fact that we were all ready to explode, we nearly licked our dessert plates clean.  If I were to look at their dessert menu, I probably would not have chosen this dish because I couldn't have imagined how well it would all come together.  So why four stars?  Everything was delicious, but I have had better food elsewhere.  I was also a bit disappointed with the chef's table because the chefs didn't interact with us much.  At Greenhouse, the chefs are much more amiable.  Lastly, while we were between courses, a tiny cockroach scampered near me.  A chef noticed something was wrong and came to investigate, but killed the critter without even addressing that it happened.  I know there are bugs in restaurants, but you can at least say something to us about it.  Overall, great experience and I do recommend taking the \"tour\" but be prepared to be stuffed for days afterwards!"}
{"text":"the interior of this place is pretty cool. Our waitress was a bit off on her geography (for some reason she didn't know where Boston is located....) the food was still great. However, I ordered seared ahi tuna which was served on rice, but didn't realize the rice would be served cold. Chefs choice. Next time I'll stick to a chicken dish. Wine menu was nice, which is always a plus."}
{"text":"First visit to Crop. We went on a Friday night and we had a reservation for 7:15 but the dining room was just over half full. We bypassed the appetizers and ordered wine. Nothing on the dinner menu was overly tempting but walleye was a nightly special. Loved it, it was amazing. My husband had the ribeye from the menu. He said it was good but not amazing. Our service was average at best. We did ask the host to take us down to the vault which was impressive. I'd come back for happy hour but wouldn't come for dinner again."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting our trip to Crop to end in the best meal of my life (so far) but he sure the heck did. Crop is 5 stars in my book and I only wish I could keep experiencing the night over and over.   We made our reservation for 8PM on Friday night at the Chef's Table. The CF at Crop is  bit unlike others. Instead of a table to yourself in the kitchen you are sat at a long bar overlooking the kitchen/prep. It's pretty cool and also comfortable for bar like seating. I think I'd actually have a hard time sitting elsewhere in the restaurant because we loved being in the action. Having each dish presented to us by the chef/owner was so cool, a highlight for sure.   We did the Tour de Chef, a very flavor bursting, stomach filling meal. Every course was beyond my imagination. Things I never liked before, I loved here such as beets and scallops!   We also paired my meal with a wine tasting so for each course I had a new glass of wine. They were not skimpy on the wine either. My husband had the beer tasting and our waiter proceeded to tell us, \"i like you guys!\" so I'm giving you full glasses of beer from now on instead of tastings. Advice- if you do tastings you are going to be rolling out of there!!   Crop was overall more than a 5* in our book. It was the best restaurant experience I have had thus far. The best food I have had and wrapped up with some amazing service to make us truly feel special.   Go here for: Dates, chefs tastings, cool atmosphere, good happy hour, to be ooooed and awed.   Don;t go here for: Probably not the most family friendly. If you're not open minded to food. Also, if you complain it's too expensive- some people are just happy with their Texas Roadhouse steak and prices to realize the true magnificence of this place."}
{"text":"We went for brunch and we were absolutely surprised!!! The food was amaze balls, a complimentary mimosa or bloody marry is included with the brunch as well as omelets made to order. Make sure you get the crab and lobster in your omelet. The lay out includes fresh fruit, French toast, chicken, Mac and cheese, fish and crackers, brisket, crab legs, and more. Cost was $40.00 per person I would of preferred about thirty bucks but I guess the extra ten is for the atmosphere"}
{"text":"Been to Crop Bistro a few times, and have been impressed, but not wowed each time. Now, the fact that 2/3 of my visits have been on a holiday is worth noting. For those of you who haven't worked in the restaurant business, holidays are the WORST. Line cooks and servers are just cranking through trying to keep up with the rush, so the fact that they consistently put out very good food, with outstanding service even on those busy nights gives Crop an A in my book.    Entrees and desserts have been good, but compared to similarly-priced restaurants in the CLE area, they're par for the course. The highlights from my last few visits have been the appetizers and cocktails. The calamari - wow. In my opinion, they're the standard by which to measure little fried squids in this town. They come with an awesome curried aioli and a seaweed salad, and they're lightly battered and fried hot and crispy. No rubber bands here. They knocked out the fried oyster appetizer as well , with similar sauces and garnish. As for the cocktails, I had an Old Gold, which was a gin & lemon soda with the interesting twist of rosemary-infused honey. Killer.   All in all, it's worth a trip for the venue alone. You'll get your money's worth in the experience, and the food won't let you down."}
{"text":"A couple years ago I ate at the chef table and was wowed.  Perhaps i had high expectations for tonight when I returned........  Not impressed by the meal tonight.  Seating: Friday night reservations.  Place 40% occupied  They sat my wife and i were seated at a small 2 top table against a wall when there were many empty 4 tops throughout the restaurant.  Not a great start.  I figured that the must have later reservations booked.  Not the case and the restaurant remained half full until we left at 9pm on a Friday.    Service: Waitress seemed inexperienced and very young especially for a Friday night   Food: I had the Halibut special.  They missed the mark.  They must have seared the halibut for a bit too long which caused the fish to get a bit over cooked. The eggplant ragu was overly acidic and seemed to overpower the dish.    Did enjoy: Beet salad was terrific  The \"moon light\" cocktail was remarkably tasty. Great construction and flavor balance for both the beet salad and the cocktail.    Not planning on coming back"}
{"text":"We went to Crop this past Saturday night. We're from out of town, so I called first to make reservations. I'm handicapped and asked for table that was easy to get to, the girl I spoke to assured me it wasn't a problem, I had assumed that she noted that in our reservation.  We got there, crowded, its a beautiful old bank bldg. I gave the receptionist my name, no note for handicapped person on the reservations. Someone else showed us to our table, which was up 3 stairs, no railing. No other table available.  Started with the truffled popcorn, good, rich, bacon flavor, we also got the deviled eggs with the bits of proscuitto on top; good, bacon flavor. My daughter and husband got the cassolet with duck breast and white beans, nice, rich, bacon flavor. I got the brick chicken with pureed celery root, so-so chicken with gravy and a licorice tasting puree. This place loves bacon, and lots of butter, and not much else.  This place is good if you love large restaurants. The food was mediocre, and I would have preferred to go to Sergio's which blows this place away."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, good food, exellent service."}
{"text":"I'd give it 5 stars if the service was a smidge better. Our waiter spent way too much time drooling on the woman at the next table (in front of her date). Awkward.  Drinks were yummy, wine list was well done, and the space itself is great.  The appetizers very good, but not great. The entrees were the definite highpoint. I had the rabbit 2 ways, and he had the giant veal chop. Both could not have been better. Bravo Crop!"}
{"text":"FANCY SCHMANCY!    I haven't dined here, so I can't speak on the food (although it looked delish).  I drank, and I drank, and I drank some more (oh, and I finagled a slice of the heaven they make at the bar called BACON!).  That bacon was the best bacon I've ever had.  It was like dessert bacon.  O how I wanted to take the bacon home and have it the next morning for breakfast.  Le sigh...CROP YOU SHOULD DO BRUNCH and give the gift of bacon & bloody Marys to the CLE!  Ok, on to the drinks.  They were good.  Top shelf.  High Quality & not quite as high priced as VTR (thank the baby Jesus for that!).    There was some fun people watching too.  I've been hiding in a cave of late, so I forgot that CLE had some high-rollin' kind of people.  It was amazing to watch the pick-ups that were happening (or trying to happen) in this joint!  But hey, if you're gonna pick someone up...do it in a swank joint!   Go to Crop.   You'll thank me. And the other Yelpers!"}
{"text":"Oh my, is this place gorgeous!  I love the historic feel to the space too.  And to match the decor my Braised short ribs were impressive. I was here with a birthday party of 15 and after dinner we got a tour of the vault which totally added to the whole charm of the restaurant.  This felt like a full out event.  What stopped it from being a 5 star night was the service.  7 of us got there at our reservation time but they would not seat us in the empty restaurant until half of our party showed up (if only we had a .5 person extra).  And then during dinner our server complained several times that we were his first big table he has ever had and wanted to never do it again.  But we ended the night on a high note because the lady who gave us the vault tour was awesome and knew her stuff."}
{"text":"I was visiting Cleveland for the weekend and was searching for a place to eat on a Sunday night.  We were in the down town area and came across Crop Bistro.  We weren't quit sure where we wanted to eat, but we had read about the Sunday Supper which is a pre-fix meal including salad, entree and dessert for a reasonable $25.  We called and the manager was very friendly and offered to e-mail us the menu for the night, which included several entree options for any discerning pallet of taste.  After gazing at the menu, we decided to go for it. It was a very chilly walk, but as we entered we were warmly welcomed.  We sat down and the decor was vibrant with large photographs of veggies and fruit.  We were promptly asked for our drink orders.  We scanned over the drink list with a very high price tag, so we opted for water, which throughout the night was unfortunately slowly refilled.   To start off the Sunday Supper was a winter salad to share.  It was delicious, especially the addition of beets.  It also included goat cheese, pickled red peppers, apple, nuts, and some sort of vinaigrette. It was made for two large salads and we could have been satisfied with that.  However, I quickly remembered about the salmon I had ordered. The Tasmanian salmon was coated with what the menu called salsa verde.  When I ordered, I was afraid I was get some Mexican dish, but the coating was actually very flavorful.  It was made with green herbs and capers.  The perfectly cooked salmon with crisp edges and a medium center was placed on top of diced celery root and extra virgin olive oil.  When all of the flavors came together it was to die for. My boyfriend who says he doesn't like salmon even liked it. He got the beef ribs smothered with pan gravy.  It was also great.  Along side the entrees there was also an additional side item to share.  It was a heaping portion of buttery mashed potatoes with chunks of carrots mixed in. They were also good and made a nice accompaniment to the meal. To finish off the meal was a slice of pumpkin pie.  While the whipped cream was absolutely delicious flavored with a hint of ginger, there was too much.  We found half of ours on the side of our plates.   Make sure to visit the restroom!  Next to the sink was a basket of locally made soap cut into individual use pieces.  It was great; the woman's  restroom and some earthy smelling soap, while the man's had pumpkin. Over all the dining experience was great, except for the unengaged cold shoulder server who was slow to refill our water. If I am ever in Cleveland on a Sunday, you will find me at Crop!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Crop! I have only been here for lunch, but everything I've ever ordered the handful of times I've been here has been great. The balsamic popcorn is a must. Customer service is always great. It's also indescribably cool to eat in an old bank for some reason."}
{"text":"Not a good experience at all.  Very Loud, average to below average service and the food was just ok.  The reason why that is important is ones expectations when you go to a high end resturant is different then Bob Evans. The bill was big, the food was sub-par and the waiter was not interested and just going through the motions.  Sorry,  I wanted to be wowed and I was not.  Let me add, all I ever heard about the Crop was excellent.  This review is based on my experience 6 months ago.  Hope it has changed."}
{"text":"I visited Crop with my partner's parents last night. I was delighted to see they had made good use of the old bank building on Lorain, preserving the decorative ceiling and frescoes. However, it was very loud due to all that marble.   I feel that the menu was fairly sparse, not allowing for persons who choose not to eat meat. (okay, one pasta dish and it was $20 for ravioli). The only chicken on the menu was fried. I ate the salmon, which was delicious, accompanied by miso-broth infused veggies and mashed cauliflower.   As far as service goes, it could have been a little better. The hostess didn't exactly greet us, so much as stare and wait for us to announce the number in our party. Our waitress was around about a quarter as much as the water-service guys. No specials or information about the restaurant was announced, and the drinks menu was removed from the table right after we ordered one drink apiece.    Overall, I would say the food was good, but not necessarily warranting the type of pricing in place."}
{"text":"This place is delicious!!! I started off with a Mr. Figgy after seeing all the recommendations on yelp and yes it is a must try drink. The bacon was delicious and the drink was sweet just gown I like it (I wished there were more than one piece of bacon..lol). Then I order their salmon dish (can't remember the exact name of the dish but it was magnificent!!!). I was too full to try their dessert so I will definitely be back to try their pistachio cheesecake!!"}
{"text":"Came back to Crop to celebrate a special occasion! This is the first time I've been here since they moved to Ohio City. The space in the former bank is amazing - my beau and I love the ambiance here.  We really enjoyed ourselves here. We decided to go all out and order these items:  - Cherry Bomb - still a fun dish! The corn polenta is still very delicious. It's chorizo in plum tomato wrapped in fried wonton skins. My beau enjoyed this a lot - I thought it was a little lacking in flavor and a little cheesy, but then again, I wasn't eating the chorizo part of it.   - Asparagus salad - very refreshing salad with local ingredients and a hint of lemon   - Grilled veal chop - this is the dish to get. Beau ordered this and raved about how it was the tenderest meat he had ever had - and he has high standards for grilled meats. He doesn't give his praise away easily, and he really enjoyed this. The portions are very sizable for the price.  - I had the Tasmanian salmon. It was grilled perfectly - very tender and flavorful. I enjoyed the fava beans and the quinoa, but there was a little too much quinoa for me.   Overall, I still love Crop, and we will be back here for special occasions and dinners with out of town guests. It's still one of the best restaurants in Cleveland, I think."}
{"text":"There is a pleasing traditional meets forward-thinking concept at Crop. Top marks for the old school service and historic building. It's too bad that we couldn't check out the vault that evening.   Some other thoughts:  The food quality is good, which may warrant high prices, but it still seemed a tad overpriced.  Not to be a negative Natty, but I do feel the need to provide some further anti-hype for the popular balsamic popcorn and cherry bomb appetizers.  The cherry bombs in particular are worth skipping completely, even if you're curious, like we were. The best part is the name and concept, which is probably what lures people to order them in the first place. The taste and texture, however, is just your standard tex-mex fare. The bombs sit on some tasty beans I admit, but I don't know; I wasn't feeling this dish at all.   THIS IS THE APP TO ORDER:  Pan Seared Scallops 15 Sweet Potato Croquette, Grilled Pineapple Salsa, Pineapple Beurre Blanc, Cilantro Oil  It may compare with or even overshadow your mains. I was feeling this one--I was practically molesting it. Unforgettably tasty.   The desserts are somewhat experimental compared to the mains. Hits and misses are to be expected.   The drink list is varied. If you're wanting a bottle of wine but don't want to splurge, there are some lower-priced bottles. For example, $28 will get you a basic but drinkable Spanish Mourvèdre or, for the same price, you can try a more interesting white like an Albarino from Rias Baixas.  There are complimentary warm rolls with honey and black pepper spiked butter. Too good.  Although this is called \"Crop Bistro\", those of you who are searching for an actual bistro atmosphere should avoid this highly impressive but un-cozy setting. Having said that, I still felt the warmth somehow; the lighting and decor help, but perhaps it is the company I keep, not to mention the wine."}
{"text":"Crop Bistro boasts a rustic charm surprising for the more downtown environs of Cleveland.  The idea, however, dovetails well in to their ethos of fresh produce and sustainable farming practices.  Healthy choices in ingredients play well into the numerous copper pots that adorn the walls and the pictures of fresh produce that hang on every side.  The foie gras was the best that I've had in Cleveland thus far, and I also had the mushroom tatin.  Also good.  While I probably won't have the mushroom again, I did enjoy their lamb loin immensely.  Crop Bistro will deflnitely get another visit from me, with its slightly eclectic charm and fresh fare.    4.5 stars from me, rounded down."}
{"text":"Eh.  First the pluses: the space is gorgeous, one of the most beautiful restaurant spots in Cleveland.  More places should follow Crop's lead.  The staff is friendly and very accommodating and knowledgeable of vegetarian/vegan options.  The chocolate logic dessert was excellent.  The minuses: the food is disappointing.  My special order tofu entree was bland, and served room temperature. My mom, who never complains about anything, said he short ribs were so-so.  The mac and cheese was unbelievably bland; I tasted almost no cheese whatsoever. Many of the entrees seemed overly complicated; too many ingredients, too many cuisines in one dish.  Focus, focus, focus.  Overall, a great place to take a date or an out-of-town visitor, but not a foodie."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The restaurant is located in a historic bank building originally started by Carnegie and Rockefeller. Atmosphere is grand and awesome. The food is phenomenal. Everybody I went with loved their meal."}
{"text":"Best lunch you could imagine! The Chicken Alfredo Pasta was the best I've ever had. Plus, the space is unbelievably gorgeous. It's in a restored bank with gorgeous ceilings, chandeliers, and marble floor to ceiling.  The price was unbelievably reasonable  for The service,food, and environment!"}
{"text":"I came here to celebrate my 6 year anniversary and expected great things from a place that had such great reviews, but in the end came away a little disappointed.  The best part of the dinner were the drinks we ordered before dinner. But as far as food goes, we were all relatively disappointed. The appetizers were good, but it did not WOW us in any way, shape or form. If I remember correctly, I got a porkchop for entree and that was just very so-so. The meat wasn't very tender and the sauce was just okay.  However, the decor in there was fun because they definitely turned what seemed to be an old train station into a restaurant. It's kind of like eating in GRAND CENTRAL station! Isn't that kind of fun? :D  With that said, we would give this place one more try just because most of the Yelpers still seem to like this place. There must be something good about it other than the decor! To-be-continued......"}
{"text":"I love this place. The first time my husband and I went we had the tasting menu and it was wonderful. This last time we ordered off the menu. The popcorn was delicious and the butternut squash ravioli was good, but not as good as the short rib Wellington my husband had.  Delicious!!!! The drinks are tasty and dessert was wonderful. We love this place for the food and the ambiance is great too. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for awhile.  I\"m not big on downtown places but I'm glad we did.  The food was overall impressive.  The balsamic and truffle popcorns were both amazing.  We tried several of the drinks all were unique and super yummy too.  I had the beet salad and my husband had the wedge salad - also good.  The calamari and the ribs were unfortunately just OK.  I got the cropper nutter for dessert and it was the best dessert I've had in awhile!  I'm still thinking about it!  The atmosphere wasn't anything special and the crowd was a little older than we expected.  Maybe that will will change when/if they move to Ohio City?  The service was pretty good.  We had some allergy issues in our group and they were very attentive to our needs.  Oh, and they gave us complimentary \"crop-sicles\" - refreshing little palate cleansers that tasted like basil lemonade.    Overall a nice evening - Ok atmosphere, good food, great dessert!  The only thing that was a turn off was that it was a little pricey for what you got.  I guess that's what downtown is all about though."}
{"text":"My first visit to Crop Bistro and I'll certainly be back.    The valet parking is very convenient especially in such a busy neighborhood.  We had 7:15 pm reservations on a Saturday night and were seated as soon as we arrived.  The place is beautiful!  A large space in a former bank.  My only complaint is how loud it is.  With such high ceilings and nothing to muffle the sound, it was sometimes hard to hear my dinner companions.  I started with the wedge salad, my husband had a beet salad and our friends split the seared scallops.  We all enjoyed our first courses and our friends agreed that their scallops were plenty to share.    For our entrees, I ordered the rolled pork, my husband had salmon, one friend ordered the pasta of the day (\"a big pile of crop\") and another friend had the braised short ribs. My pork was a little dry but I enjoyed the sides.  Everyone else loved their dishes with no complaints.  Although we were all very full from dinner, we couldn't resist the dessert the server recommended -- buche de noel.  Each couple split one and it was the perfect end to a wonderful dinner."}
{"text":"I was in on Saturday for lunch with my parents and I did something that I have never done. We walked out before our food even arrived. We came in and were sat and greeted immediately. This was the highlight of the visit. Our waitress, I call her waitress because she failed to even give us her name, appeared agitated when we didn't order drinks, just water. See 2/3 of our group do not drink, therefore we just stuck with water. Then when ordering, she didn't ask how I wanted my burger cooked, nor did she inform us of what the side of the day was. So then we waited. And waited. And waited some more. We could see our food sitting under the heat lamps while our waitress was nowhere to be found and the person who was expediting the food was busy taking photos of a group. 10 minutes went by and we just decided to leave. I can understand letting the plate heat up under the  lamp, but for that long it's going to inevitably dry out the food.   I had heard nothing but good things about the whole group of Crop restaurants and couldn't wait to try it, even just for lunch.  But this visit was so offputting, I won't be back.  I have even tried to contact the restaurant prior to writing this review, but have gotten no response from anyone as of this writing."}
{"text":"-Quick Review- Recommended dish: Short Rib Wellington  Suitable for: dates, girl's night out, dinners with family and friends   -Full Review- I came here on a Saturday night with a large group of friends and here are my thoughts:   //Parking// There's valet parking available for ~$5, but if you're a cheap grad student like myself, park on the streets for free! There are plenty of neighborhood street parking nearby. I found one that was a block away.   //Atmosphere// The restaurant is very... OPEN. There are extremely high ceilings decorated with beautiful Roman/Greek paintings. I felt like I was in a fancy museum! Since I came here at night, the restaurant was dimly lit. Mood setting, much?   //Food// I was surprised by the limited options on the menu (less than 20 appetizers and entrees total), but as I've learned in my Psychology classes, the fewer the options, the easier it is for consumers to make a decision. Appetizers are priced around $10-15, while entrees are priced from $24-40. Yes, it's quite a pricey place to dine, but sometimes you just gotta treat yourself out to sum sum. I chose the Short Rib Wellington and was extremely satisfied with my order! I'm a huge meat lover, so this dish just hit the spot :) It had a crispy outer layer covering the juicy, savory inner short rib layer. MMM.. I'm practically drooling now just writing this review. I suggest eating this dish quickly though, as the crispy layer may get soggy after 15 or so minutes!   //Service// No complaints! Servers were attentive and service was speedy. How can I tell? Well, my water cup was FULL the entire time and I tend to drink a lot of water :)"}
{"text":"This Crop is ready for harvest!  The Up-Side:  I've been avoiding the Warehouse District at night for a while now.  It is simply overrun with cheesy and vapid people that mistake loud music and racy outfits for a \"classy\" time.  However, upon meeting somebody for lunch the other day at Crop, I was pleasantly surprised by the daytime Warehouse District vibe.  Crop provides a fun mix of healthy and tasty food in an open and pleasant atmosphere.  The hostess and server were very friendly, and the food was delivered quickly, and with a nice presentation.  I had the \"Willie Bird Smoked Turkey on Cornbread.\"  It was excellent.  The Down-Side:  Gotta be honest, I didn't notice any downside to Crop.    The Sum-It-Up:  If you're like me, and need to revive your faith in the Warehouse District being more than just a nighttime hangout for the cheese, try Crop for lunch or dinner.  It's quite fun and healthy.    I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Exquisite.  The grandeur of the venue makes this place very special.  It does look like Grand Central Station a bit, as another yelper mentioned in a review below.  There are colorful murals, sculpted ceilings, and large mirrors adorning the walls.    The food is pretty special too.  I had the pork chop with cheese grits and wilted greens.  Perfect.  Just what I had in mind.  I ate every last bite.  Unfortunately I didn't have dessert, but here are some of the offerings: * Chocolate Custard, Pretzel Crust, Malted Whip, Salted Caramel, Chocolate Dipped Pretzel * Seared Foie Gras, Espresso Blondie, Black Pepper, Rosemary, Chocolate, Whipped Cream * Fall Spice Waffle, Cider Baked Apples, Brown Butter Caramel, Maple Custard, Sugar Cage Garnish  And next time I want to try this cocktail: Fig Infused Bulleit Bourbon, Sweet Vermouth, Rhubarb Bitters, Bruled Bacon  Service is fantastic.   So yes.....I will be returning.  I am already having trouble deciding what I will order.  They offer a perfect harvest of \"crops\" and it was a pleasure to have dined here."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness.. .  I've walked passed by this place on multiple of occasions and did not think much of the place. From the exterior, all one can see is the sign of the restaurant attached to a building.   I had a lunch meeting here and upon entering, I was astonished to see how beautiful and spacious the interior is. At the time, a Christmas tree was still up and standing at maybe 30ft. I also learned that there was vault within the building that they allowed customers to view on certain occasions.   The menu was short, sweet and simple. They offer high quality food that I personally consider are healthy options. The menu included a history of the building, which was interesting to read.   The service was wonderful, our waiter was attentive until it got busier, but it was on top of his game nonetheless.   I hope to return to such a wonderful business for future brunch meetings."}
{"text":"This place is gorgeous. Absolutely stunning inside. The food was great. Fried Oysters for appetizers well well cooked and garnished with pico de gallo and over avocado. Quite good. I had the seafood gumbo and that was excellent as well, spicy and flavorful. For my meal, I had lamb over what could only be the best risotto I have ever had. Incredible. We had the Ebony and Ivory for desert... it blew my socks across the room. Service was friendly and efficient, highly recommended."}
{"text":"The charm of this place is the best. Love the history of the building. The food is great. We got the balsamic popcorn to start and it was so so good!  Had the chicken confit and pasta special for our meals and both were awesome. For dessert we got the chocolate cake and it was only so so. Would skip dessert but otherwise go go go!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!  This is definitely one of the best restaurants in Cleveland.  I visited during restaurant week and my favorite dish, which I have yet to see recreated, was a duck tart with MacKenzie creamery goat cheese.  Good god, was it delicious.  Seriously, it was an orgasm in my mouth.    The more courses that came out (soups, salads, mains!, desserts) the more my appreciation for this place grew.  On my second visit, I went for a Sunday Supper.  I was NOT disappointed.  Their food is impeccable.  The staff is outstanding and the concept (I'm a locavore so this restaurant ranks very high with me) is genius.  Keep up the good work, Crop!"}
{"text":"Embarrassment. Made reservations for six people on a Friday evening. I've never been to this restaurant. And I will save my first impression was terrible. For the most part the restaurant was empty they seated us behind this wall staring at kitchen equipment and servers coming in and out preparing food and drinks at the only table behind the wall which was us. Front portion of the restaurant was nicely decorated and they stuck us back behind the storage area very unimpressive. Not to mention blasting music up-and-down in volume as were trying to have a conversation before we Even had a chance to order  . We asked for the manager to come and address the issue of where they sat us in the restaurant he never came to our table once we got up and we left I asked for the manager and he did nothing to remedy our disappointment we will never go there I will never ever recommend anyone to this place but should change your name to crap bistro bar and grill. Very unprofessional manager to send away a table of six like that and not even make any attempts to accommodate us"}
{"text":"Went for a friend's bday this morning for brunch. Totally fantastic. Great service, great food & atmosphere. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Crop seems to be a restaurant created in the theme of Farm to Table style dishes. It  tastes like they use very fresh ingredients, and the overwhelming use of 3-5 specific ingredients tells me that they do get abundances from farms nearby.   Large party was lots of fun. Sunday Supper is a great deal. The space is amazing! Decor, lighting, structure and open kitchen with counter style chef table is spot on. The kitchen staff puts it down! Consistent dishes and perfect timing even for full restaurant and only 4 cooks. Drinks from the bar were pricey but very inventive and also, word-o-the-day, Fresh!   Ordered the fish, I think it was called Hamamatsu over Creamed cauliflower and tomato wedges. It was okay. Clean, white fish flavor. But nothing out of this world. Cauliflower must have been the ingredient of the day because it was everywhere. As a family style side and as a component of almost every dish.   Dessert was a pretty tasty, blondie. But again nothing special. I would like to return and try their full menu. I know the menu is based on Farm to Table but I would also like to see them take the freshness and really accent it with robust flavor.  Overall I thoroughly enjoyed my dining experience and will return to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"I went here first when it was still on 6th and it was delicious.  Now that it's moved to a beautiful new location on 25th and Lorain the food is still delicious and the atmosphere gets two thumbs way up. Taking advantage of a beautiful old bank building like this in Cleveland makes me happy.  I can't wait to go again.  I also heard they have a nice little private dining room. I look forward to taking advantage of that."}
{"text":"We went on a Friday night and it wasn't overly crowded - partly because it is a large space.  This building was formally a bank and even walking in feels grand.  The walls and ceiling are beautiful and the room has large neoclassical pillars that whisk you away.   We were seated at a table, but it was chilly and then we noticed the amazing bar by the kitchen.  We relocated and it was the right move! We were able to sit near the pass and I felt like we had booked the chefs table in advance.   We ordered cocktails, both delicious.  As we were making selections the chef brought over a tasting of beef bacon (not on the menu) with slaw dressed in a delightful sauce.  It was great and a perk to setting by the kitchen.  For appetizer, we had the cherry bombs. They were very good and have a strong southwestern flavor.  Chorizo is hard to say no to and these were again very good, but we probably wouldn't order them again next time.   We also had the scallop appetizer and was slightly let down.  Maybe because I had Mediterranean for lunch and and the flavors felt to familiar.  Also, it is high in citrus and just didn't fit my wine or mood.   My entree was the veal chop and at $45 I expected something amazing.  I was not let down.  So tender and although I am not a raving mushroom fan, the topping is outstanding!  It is served with a potato cake that completes the chop well.   Paired with a nice mild red.... I was a happy girl.  For dessert, (don't judge me) I had the inverted s'mores. It was Ah-freakin-mazing!  Holy cow... Graham cracker ice cream... I didn't even know you and after one encounter - I am in love!  The  dark chocolate and chocolate marshmallows were perfection and the wafers of meringue blew me away.  A must try!  I really wanted to give Crop a 5, but landed at a solid 4.  For the ambiance alone, you should go and I HIGHLY recommend the seats by the kitchen.  It was a wonderful night out with my favorite person in his home town.  Way to go CLE!"}
{"text":"This is one of my all time favorite restaurants! I try something new everytime I go and I am never disappointed! Try to get the chef's table if possible. You get to sit and watch them cook and even try some samples :-) It's a little pricey but well worth it! They have a nice wine menu and knowledgeable staff."}
{"text":"Very nice experience.  Excellent food, wonderful building, attentive service.  Somewhat pricey but worth it for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Came for Sunday brunch and I'll tell you, $40 was so worth it! So much food and everything was absolutely amazing. Pretty much one of the best restaurant experiences of my life. Will be back many times.   Only one slight annoyance; we were seated at a table right by the host. For our entire meal, it felt like she was just watching us. I understand she was checking table availability, literally doing her job, but man it was uncomfortable. I just wish our table was a little bit further or something."}
{"text":"I read about Crop in Continental's in-flight magazine http://magazine.continental.com/200806-go-eat the feature came in handy as I was somewhat concerned about the availability of food options in downtown Cleveland.  It turns out, I need not have been -- I ended up eating at the Bistro for much of my stay in Cleveland.  They are closed on Monday which forced me to try Lola's, a dining and service experience that made me appreciate Crop Bistro even more.  I started with a Sunday Supper -- a three course prix-fixe.    The corn bread merits a word or two.  The cornbread at the bistro shares the shape and texture with a perfect macaroon.  It is moist and perfectly balanced, and comes with cinnamon butter.   The summer salad is a treat -- a heap of fresh greens with finely grated cheese surrounded by helpings of goat cheese, apricots, red and gold beets, artichoke hearts, fresh cucumbers and sun dried tomatoes arranged along the circumference of the plate.  Fennel adds an interesting note to the taste.  The skirt steak in my entree came with grilled mushrooms and onions as well as hash browns baked in a pie with crunchy crust.  I am not sure if there is such a thing as food that is too flavorful -- I like potatoes that taste like potatoes -- but I thought there was a distinct possibility that someone got carried away with the rosemary in the potato pie.  The desert was a peach crumble with vanilla ice cream.  Both the ice cream and the pastry were light and did not overwhelm the flavor of the fruit.  Over the week that I spent in Cleveland I tried nearly everything on the menu and it was uniformly spectacular.  Among the appetizers, the figs and the foie gras were particularly memorable and in my next lifetime I hope to develop a sufficient metabolism to try the entire desert menu.  What makes Crop a great place to eat in addition to the outstanding ingredients (they get their own custom pasta from the Ohio Pasta company) and the food is the staff and the service.  At another restaurant, my rolling in close to closing time on Sunday might have meant less than friendly service.  At Crop, it meant that I got to get to know the owner and the kitchen staff and get there votes for the best pirogies in Cleveland -- Ohio City Pasta Company stand at the West Side Market.    The casual friendly atmosphere permeates the place -- the staff go out of their way to make sure that you are having a good experience.  Every time I was there, Scott, the bartender, went out of his way to be attentive -- despite my protestations, he comped me on a drink when the cranberry juice I ordered was not expediently forthcoming .  One night I blanked on the fact that prosciutto is made out of pork which I don't eat until the Gorgonzola stuffed figs were already on the table.  As I was offering the appetizer (or the prosciutto) to my dining companions, the appetizer was whisked from the table and Jeff from the kitchen remade the dish for me from scratch."}
{"text":"Stopped in Sunday to enjoy their brunch. The atmosphere in the restaurant is really nice, I think it used to be a bank because you can still see the old vault still intact. The service is excellent and the brunch menu is phenomenal. To start they offer mimosas, bloody marys and an omelet with what ever you would like in it. Then for the buffet they have a wide variety of options from salads, shrimp, smoked salmon to a lovely carving station with leg of lamb and prime rib. They also a full line of your breakfast items from eggs Benedict to biscuits and gravy.  I have to say this is the best brunch in the city!"}
{"text":"Amazing space, service and food. Actually, the food was not amazing. It was heavenly."}
{"text":"This place really has it all! I came here with a few friends on Friday night and we all had a blast at this super cool restaurant! The ambiance and decor are fantastic. I don't know what this building was before but the architecture is just fantastic. As for food...DELICIOUS! I tried the calamari, deviled eggs and the scallops as an entree. Everything was carefully prepared and beautifully presented. The wine list is very extensive and has something to fit every budget. I was surprised to see a $30 bottle in such a nice place! All in all, great place for a date or a special night...a little pricier than the surrounding bar/restaurants in Ohio City. Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"I've visited Crop numerous time for lunch and dinner, but this was my first time visiting for Brunch (and definitely, not my last!).  My favorite meal of the day, is brunch, so I have very high standards, and Crop Bistro, met each one with flying colors!  Easy reservation for 2 through Open Table, for 10:30 AM on Sunday.  We arrived ahead of the crowd.  We were seated and immediately greeted by our server.  A complimentary mimosa or bloody mary is included in the $39 brunch price, along with coffee and soft drinks.  I ordered a mimosa and then proceeded to peruse the brunch spread.  My oh my, what a selection.  Smoked salmon, jumbo chilled shrimp, crab leg clusters, carved meat station, numerous cold salad options.  Numerous breakfast and brunch hot options and last but not least, a lovely dessert bar, with miniature treats.   I truly enjoyed Brunch at Crop and will be back.....soon!!!!"}
{"text":"Disappointing would be an understatement.  After seeing this listed as the \"best restaurant \" in Ohio, on the MSN homepage, I couldn't wait to get into town to experience the beautiful setting shown online, and the wonderful food. The building is wonderful, but that's where it stopped.  We began by ordering a $90 bottle of Pinot Noir that is supposed to be served at 62 degrees.  This bottle was ice cold.  The sever told us all of the reds were kept in the cooler at such temperatures.  For a supposed 5 Star eatery, do you not have a wine person on staff?  The $12 popcorn appetizer tasted like is was made about 6 hours earlier.  Finally, on their web site, they advertise a filet as a speciality dish.  It was not listed on the menu at all.  The sever  said we haven't offered that in a while, we must not have updated our online menu.  Just numerous comedies of error for what is supposed to be fine dining."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner with 5 of us on a busy Friday evening last week.  Overall ambiance of the place is very nice.  The menu reads well but that was about it for the positives.    It was very loud due to the high ceilings.  Service was very slow.  Appetizers were a little bland and the portions on the cheese plate were small for the price.  Entrees were equally disappointing.  Short ribs were tender but very dry and bland tasting.  Similar experiences at the rest of the table.  Desserts were a little better but not worth coming back for.    The menu was seasonal but for the last week of December there was a TON of pumpkin infused items still on there.  Probably wont go back again for the price."}
{"text":"Stopped in Cleveland on the way to the family holiday weekend -- wanted to visit the R&R HOF, but didn't expect downtown to be a bit of a foodie paradise; we looked on Yelp for dinner ideas to find not one but three highly-rated and interesting-looking places within walking distance of our hotel.    Crop Bistro was our choice on the basis of the availability of the Chef's table overlooking the open kitchen; this turned out to be a real treat as (on this slow night at least) there was plenty of opportunity to talk to the chefs, including the owner/exec chef Michael, and to watch the various dishes being prepared and plated.    Three of us shared two each of appetizers, salads, entrees, and desserts, and had plenty to eat.   I won't do a dish-by-dish, other than to say that everything was very-good-to great and to highlight the scallops-with-pea-froth, which were perhaps the best treatment of scallops I've ever had, and the jalapeno ice cream dessert which is much more than the novelty you might expect.  From watching the prep I don't think you could go wrong with anything you might order here; even seeming safety dishes like the chicken seemed to be done creatively and with care.    The place itself hits just the right mix of fancy/tasteful and relaxed/playful to complement the menu.  As noted here, we apparently hit Crop in its last few weeks at this location; the new spot must really have something going for it as this location and building seemed more than fine to us.    The wine list tries a bit too hard to be international and is priced a bit over what the menu would seem to support, but there were some fine choices available by the glass as well as some interesting bottled beers.    As we finished the dessert we watched the sous-chef prepare some eggs \"for Michael to use tomorrow morning\" -- we weren't sure what that meant but, through happy coincidence found out the next morning when we saw him on a local TV morning show demonstrating how to make his family egg salad recipe.   Now, the guy down the road apparently lost on Iron Chef America, so maybe this wasn't the ultimate celebrity-chef experience for this town, but was a little thrill nonetheless."}
{"text":"This restaurant is beautiful.  From the moment you walk in you know that you are entering somewhere special.  I loved the high ceilings and beautiful decor throughout the restaurant.    The food was fantastic.  For an appetizer our table had the popcorn (who knew that popcorn could be so flavorful?) and calamari.  Loved them both.  I had the ahi tuna for an entree and it was perfect (rare, just how I like it).  Loved the location.  It's in close proximity to the Ohio City bars - perfect to go bar hopping after enjoying a fabulous dinner.  My only complaint was that the service could have been better.  We had finished our appetizers before we saw our waiter to order our entrees.  All of our food came out quickly though.    Will we return?  Absolutely!"}
{"text":"On a very chilly evening MrWineOH and I ventured out to Crop Bistro to see what the talk was all about. One of the new additions to the restaurant scene in Ohio City - we were excited to sit at the chef's table and partake of some delicacies.  The venue is gorgeous. High ceilings, marble - beautiful space. Some folks I talked to said it was loud in the restaurant, and we did not experience that. Conversations were local to the tables, and while there was a bit of a din, it was because the restaurant was full on a Friday night.   I want to hit the highlights on the food, because the real story was a beautiful pinot noir I encountered. When we were seated at the Chef's Table, which is a beautiful granite bar in front of the kitchen - we weren't sure what to expect. But we were quickly treated to a gift from the kitchen. As an amuse bouche, we received this gorgeous egg on a little plate. The Chile Deviled Egg ($4 for 3 or $8 for 6) is a taste bud delight! I highly recommend them. Did I mention that sometimes they are pink? Yeah, you'd think that'd be a little freaky, but the flavor is incredible.  Another highlight was the Cherry Bomb - a little culinary genius that closely resembles a deep fried onion, but in reality is a wonton wrapped combination of plum tomato, chorizo sausage, jack cheese, and corn. This appetizer as shown is $8 and worth every penny. Cutting into it is a beautiful sight and the flavors blend beautifully.  One great thing we found is that a few appetizers a piece were filling and the perfect way to taste several of their signature dishes. I would not recommend the chef's table though. The way you are seated makes the waitstaff reach around you to set plates or refill a wine glass. Its awkward.  Speaking of wine!  After much consternation over the wine list - which is extensive enough by the glass and bottle to get me to thinking about the possibilities - and there are some very reasonable possibilities - accompanied by the obvious frustration of MrWineOH and our server... I selected the 2010 Sean Minor Carneros Pinot Noir. List price is $42 there.  All I can tell you is - its absolutely lovely! Cherry, plum, a bit of blueberry - and nicely balanced spice and earthiness on the finish. While this pinot noir is aged 10 months in 100% French oak of which 20% is new - there isn't overwhelming oak on the palate. I could smell the oak - but it was beautifully integrated into the flavors.  Now, will we be returning to Crop Bistro for a full meal? The jury is out on that. The other apps we had were okay, but not fabulous - and even though we spent what we'd typically spend for a night out - the great wine and the company made the evening, not the location. For a business dinner - I think it works - for a regular night out? Maybe not.   MrWineOH had some other opinions, which he's commenting on via the MissWineOH website."}
{"text":"I took a date here. I will say that the building is beautiful and elegant. It used to be a bank. The atmosphere was upscale. For an pricey, upscale restaurant, I didn't think the food was that amazing. When it comes to paying prices like this, I think the food should be worth it, and although it was very good, I would rather keep trying different restaurants than come back here anytime soon. The service was pretty good, nothing to write home about though. I think the atmosphere is what really wins it though."}
{"text":"This is the best farm to table restaurant in cleveland.   The food was fresh, delicious and completely met our expectations.  The space is grand and far surpasses it's competitors.   Lola is fine, but one feels the lack of attention from the proprietor.  Not so at crop. And the over hyped greenhouse on trendy 4th - well just read the reviews.  A chef/owner more concerned with self promotion than his food or his patrons.   Crop is the place for gastropub Farm to table.   Period."}
{"text":"Really cool bank-turned-into-restaurant. The atmosphere is very unique and the food was great. Had a lamb shank and a beer for dinner. Service was good, and the concept made it much better."}
{"text":"Crop bistro was on the list, no not the bucket list, but I am sure it would make it to some ones bucket list. Well it was on the list of restaurants in Cleveland to visit. It was worth the wait or should I say what was I doing all these years.  Ambience is a little loud but happening, good starter selection. Balsamic popcorn and the grilled  flatbread were great, would have been better if the popcorn would have been hot. Chile devilled egg was tasty    The beet salad was to die for. Very fresh and yummy.  Main coarse was the bricked half chicken which is actually deboned and has crispy parsnip which gives a different feel to it.  The crop pasta special was made with Ohio city pasta. It was with shrimp, the wait staff had no problem replacing it with chicken . He even suggested tofu.  Desert was great, especially the plating. The graham cracker with mello and the dark chocolate truffle was extremely desiccant.  This is a place that is a landmark of Cleveland. Must try it atleast once."}
{"text":"Crop is one of my top 3 favorite Cleveland places to dine. First of all, the building is just breathtaking. I asked the waitress last time I was there and she said it was an old bank. It is just so cool!! So much detail on the ceiling and the whole place has a really classy feel.  I haven't tried a dish I didn't like, everything is fresh and cooked to perfection. The deviled eggs are unlike any other. Great drink options. I have also never had bad service. I brought my mom (who is a tough critic) here when she comes to visit and it received her stamp of approval. Can't wait to go back and take my boyfriend!!"}
{"text":"I am giving this restaurant only four stars , not because of the food but the service. The server was super slow and never came to fill my water !!!!!! I lived the shrimp curry. Amazing. The noodles were home made and well that's a big seller for me. I love home made noodles over boxed !!!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding(EPIC) + 6 Out-of-Towers / Cold Rainy Night = 5 Stars.  See? It's really just about the math.  I'm working at Forest City now, as some of you may know, and for the last week I've been at NAO, the New Associate Orientation for the company. They fly in all of their people across the country to Cleveland, for a special integration into their policies and such at their headquarters at Tower City.  Anyway, my local self was challenged to find a great spot to go to, which would make 2 people from L.A., 2 people from Philly and 2 people from Dallas happy. And I knocked it out of the park, with the help from the new Crop Bistro.  If you've ever wished you could jump through the TV and enter a Film Noir movie, with late night dinners on the balcony of Grand Central Station while you wait for your contact, this is the place for you.   I hear what my pal Matty Cleveland is saying, in regards to missing the old space and its homi-ness. My grandmother thought the same thing when she moved from her house to her condo. It's a common issue.  I'll not gush too much, but 3 of the 7 total people claimed to have the best meal of their lives. Two of those folks ordered the Ohio Rib-eye. Also epic was the chicken and waffles (trust me and the wait(er)(ress)...they'll recommend it too). The sides were PERFECT, my rib-eye came with mashed potatoes and brussels sprouts. The lovely Bonnie from L.A. was the other rib-eyer, and as previously noted, she claimed it was the best steak ever. I concur.  The bar set-up is really nice. We all chilled there while they modified a couple tables into a 12-top for us, and didn't even complain when the rest of our group didn't show (they didn't make it out of Great Lakes Brewing Company). The hostess was incredibly pleasant, and made eye contact and actually listened.   You might ask, \"What if the people I bring there are incredibly boring, and if I listen to one more word they say I'll throw a glass of water in their face? What THEN??\"  Well, just ignore them and watch the kitchen. It's completely visible from most tables, and provides a neat little side-event.  The main event is the decor and natural features of the incomparable space, which is the grand lobby of a former bank. Ornate 30 to 40 foot high ceilings (that's not really an exaggeration), original restored murals on the wall, and gigantic green-marble pillars are just a few of the highlights. The interesting thing is, in the great open space, it remained remarkably moderate as far as noise levels. There was a champagne party of business-guys/future Hustler-goers at the next table, and we barely heard them.  An incredible experience.  Don't just ask me though, ask my new friends from 3 corners of the U.S., who will never look at Cleveland the same again. Nice job, Crop. You rep the 216 with style."}
{"text":"A wonderful evening from beginning to end! We arrived a little early for our 9:00 PM reservation and were welcomed warmly and seated immediately in the 'upper deck' with a great view of the restaurant space and out the huge windows to watch the hustle of Ohio City on a Saturday night. We did not tell the staff it was a special occasion, so there was no special treatment reflected in this review.  Crop was my choice for my birthday dinner and it did not disappoint. We started with the Roasted Beet Salad - bright and refreshing with the combination of beets and citrus offset by the tang of the goat cheese. My husband's Soft Wedge Salad came with beautifully crisp bacon -- and he saved on slice to savor after he'd cleared the plate of the beautiful greens, tomatoes and blue cheese.  Our entrees Rib Eye for me and Lamb for my husband - were delicious - perfectly cooked to our requests and just eye rollingly delicious. I can't add more to the prior reviewers raves about the Rib Eye - it lived up to the hype.  As a kid, Waffles & Ice Cream were our reward dessert when we behaved at the local fair. So, when I saw it on the Crop menu, it was a perfectly special birthday dessert. Then it arrived and all thoughts of fair fare were obliterated. This was a sublime combination of hot, lightly crispy waffles with smooth vanilla ice cream which was taken into the dessert stratosphere by the deep, rich flavor of the cherry compote. I will come back just for this dessert!!! It was a simple combination that worked perfectly.  I also have to recommend a seasonal drink which I think was named Applecup - Goslings Rum with cider ... an apple-take on the Dark & Stormy - was well-balanced, brisk and potent.   The space - yes, it's big and echo-ey - but it's also great to see historic spaces being reclaimed. We weren't looking for a romantic dinner, but I can see where it might feel a little too big for that I intimate evening feel.  We were not rushed and all of our needs were quickly attended by the efficient but not obtrusive staff.  Overall, it was a wonderful evening and I recommend trying Crop for yourself - I think it works for some diners better than others - and it definitely worked for us."}
{"text":"Look up Sunday Brunch in the dictionary and I hope it says Crop. Oh Em Gee. This is by far THE BEST brunch spread I have ever seen. And it's in Cleveland? I was in town filming with cast and crew and the entire crew was blown away just looking at it. Everything you could imagine. And Jen our server was as sweet as pie and super knowledgeable of the food.   Thanks again. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Heaven. My lunch was heaven. Too pricey for me to go for dinner but I've always been impressed for lunch. Today was phenomenal. My waitress Arleigh was knowledgeable in making recommendations and checked back with me to see if I was experiencing the dish the same way others had ( I love that! ) she was conversational too which is always appreciated.   We know the place is beautiful, I'm sure you've been told that by now. Crazy decorative high ceilings, an all around cool place to be.   Now the food: had the turkey sandwich. Sounds chill right? Wrong. It was thinly cut smoked turkey with ridiculous flavor. The cranberry chutney was so amazing I could cry. Open faced on cornbread? Always great, even better when the cornbread is soft and fresh, which it was & covered in herb aioli . Love that it comes with greens & side of the day. For a great price $9. COME CHECK OUT LUNCH!!! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"My favorite meal in Cleveland. The popcorn, the scallops - all delicious. Also love the atmosphere with the bank vault. My brother and wife live in Cleveland and they love this restaurant - I can easily see why !"}
{"text":"The food was...good...but every dish we had (party of 4, lots of sharing) seemed to have an identity crisis. I want to like it much more than I actually do. About the architecture...what can I say...Crop's britches are too big for itself. The over-the-top neoclassicism of this former bank is a little much for the restaurant. This is overtly apparent when you go to the restroom and find cheap home-depot style finishes and fixtures. If you're going to be grandiose, don't forget the details. This goes for the food as well.  I recommend that crop figure out its identity (food and image) and put a bit of effort into making its delivery more consistent overall."}
{"text":"Julie  A nice place to stop for lunch.  I had a Salmon BLT sandwich on ciabatta bread.  Tasmanian Salmon, Applewood Smoked Bacon, Tomato, Arugula, Lemon Aioli.   Salmon was medium and cooked just right to retain a moistness and the bacon just brought out fantastic flavors.  Great great sandwich in a cozy environment with excellent service.  I would imagine that dinner offerings are just as good."}
{"text":"First of all, I dine extensively for work while entertaining clients.   I frequent Proseco and 312 in Chicago.     So for Crop's prices and claims, I feel they were not up to par with entree originality and quality for the price ($130 for 2 entrees, 1 soup, 1 salad and a bottle of $45 cab). I ordered the waldorf salad to start.  It's thinly sliced in ribbons (carrots and apples) which made it unruly to eat.   I ordered the squash bisque which was average (I've had better at Melt) and while my lamb was juicy (it's a fatty meat), it was cooked through - well done.   The cous cous was great, however.   My dining mate had the salmon which was great (the sauce made it).     It's a beautiful location but the noise level at Crop is like eating on the floor of the New York stock exchange.  Overall, underwhelmed --- If I do go back it will be to have a glass of wine at the bar with some mussels.... maybe."}
{"text":"They have all u can eat brunch on Sundays Now, and it is  so so good,with lots of variety!!Just trust me and Get there ,your belly will be happy"}
{"text":"Very good! Got the cherry bomb, balsamic popcorn, pork belly, salad with pork belly (hehe), and the fried chicken waffle jumpoff that was super good. Everything tasted good! Rec'd. Our drinks were cool to."}
{"text":"Food: Overall good but not great. 1) Cherry Bomb - fried stuffed tomato, surprisingly good 2) Braised Short Ribs - they had a good taste but they weren't as tender as they could/should have been. 3) Half Pan Roasted Chicken - this was delicious and juicy.  The mole sauce sounded strange at first but it worked just right. 4) Sampler - Small portions of 3 desserts:  the bacon waffle and ice cream and two other things that I can't quite remember.  I didn't really like any of them.  Service:  Very good, attentive service.  Value:  It was consistent with other restaurants in the area--about $80 for 2 people for 2 entrees, a shared appetizer and dessert, and 1 glass of wine.  Atmosphere:  Pretty great.  The place itself is very nice and wide open with high ceilings.  It's a former bank in that grand, traditional style.  It's definitely an after-work type of crowd.  CONCLUSION:  A good restaurant with a beautiful space in a very cool area of Cleveland."}
{"text":"Culinarily creative. Redoubtable. Opulent. Posh. Crop is everything you could want in a fine dining experience in Cleveland. While I realize there is nothing I'm about to say that hasn't already been recited ad nauseum by others smitten by their experiences at Crop I fear I must continue anyway. For if I wasn't able to share at least a modicum of my experience with someone I'm afraid I may be forced to walk around with a freakish food smile plastered on my face for the rest of the week and that wouldn't be fair to everyone else, especially the children.  This was our first visit. It was to celebrate our 13th wedding anniversary so the expectations were high. After all, anniversary dinners are supposed to be like that, right? Reservations at 6pm on a Thursday. Did we need them? No. There were only a handful of other partons in the cavernous dining room at this early hour, but come 7pm it was hopping and energetic.  Speaking of the interior, what more can be said. It's beautiful. As others have said, it's huge. The ceilings stretch upward for miles, large columns line the walls and the mural on the wall behind the front bar is simply awe-inspiring. History oozes from every nook and cranny and it feels like a bit of Grand Central Station swallowed a restaurant. I'm a history nerd, so what. Seeing a space like this repurposed instead of forgotten or, worse yet, razed in the name of progress, is brilliant. One recommendation, ask to see the vault when you're there. It's downstairs in the basement and it's really cool.  The service, oh the service. This is what we've been missing. It had been so long since we'd been pampered in a restaurant that we'd almost forgotten what it was like. Nimble waitstaff, white-shirted, aproned attuned to your every need. Empty dishes whisked away, fresh flatware promptly furnished, fresh bread and butter, water glasses never empty. We were left wanting for nothing. Our dining guide, Ursula, was amazing. Always smiling, ever present without us even realizing it, she helped make our experience all the more memorable. This is why you won't blink twice when the bill arrives.  The food at Crop is exactly what you'd expect and a lot more of what you wouldn't. It's fresh, it's local and it's seasonal. The menu is intelligently designed with a mix of the familiar and the surprising. I was in the mood to try nearly everything on the list by the time we arrived but this is a good thing. Our dinner went as follows:  Fresh bread and butter - Soft, sweet cornbread and crispy, chewy baguette accompanied by creamy butter. Simple and incredibly addictive. It's best to eat these sparingly lest you spoil your dinner.  Crispy calamari - We are suckers for fried calamari and when it's done right it's a thing of beauty. This rendition featured julienned squid, crispy and not greasy, a coconut green curry aioli and Napa cabbage and seaweed slaw. While I found the breading to be a bit saltier than I'd prefer the squid was tender, almost noodle-like, and the curry had a lovely, lingering heat.   Chili deviled eggs - A trio of egg halves, one pickled purple, filled with a creamy yolk puree spiced with smoky chipotle peppers and stabbed with slices of crisped prosciutto ham. Not too spicy and perfectly balanced. The balsamic and pickling liquid plate dressings took them over the top.   The Lamb - Two meaty chops with pearly white Frenched bones topped with a dark sauce setting atop apricot Israeli couscous and fig chutney. The meat was cooked mid-well (I prefer my lamb medium) and tender with a crispy char that I loved. The couscous, dotted with diced red onion, red peppers, wilted arugula and yellow grape tomatoes was fresh while the sweetness of the apricots and figs weren't overpowering. Balanced on the knife's edge of sweet and savory.  Cherry chipotle ribs - This was a summer BBQ done high-class style. Six fall-off-the-bone pork ribs stacked Lincoln Log-like dressed in a sweet and smoky cherry/pepper sauce accompanied by cold potato salad and coleslaw. The slaw was sweet, crunchy and delightfully familiar and the stone ground mustard used in the potato salad was an unexpected touch.  Pretzel unlogic - Save room for this dessert. The slice is perfectly sized for sharing. Unbelievably smooth and rich chocolate custard on a chocolate and pretzel bit crust (a challenge to cut through, so be careful) rests on swirls of salted caramel and topped with malted whipped cream. The level of sweetness was spot on. A master's class in salty-sweet. Share the chocolate-covered pretzel at the end.  From beginning to end our experience at Crop was outstanding. The few minor items I mentioned above were nitpicking, I'll admit, but when faced with near perfection it's human nature, right? The service was wonderful, the food outrageously tasty and the atmosphere, well, you already know about the atmosphere. It's classy and laid back. It's historic and current. It's familiar and new. Thanks Crop."}
{"text":"A short walk from the West side markets, this is a beautiful bistro made from what used to be a bank building. Our group of five shared the Cherry Bombs and Balsamic popcorn as appetizers and both were huge hits! The waiter brought out bread and butter for us, and I have to say it was the best butter I've had in my entire life. For my main course, I had the \"cropicana bowl\" and it was delicious. I don't know if I will ever enjoy chipotle again after eating that. The beans were my favorite part, they had a perfect level of spicy and sweetness. Would definitely recommend it for anyone in the Cleveland area, especially after some browsing in the west side market."}
{"text":"If you are looking to dine Ina museum, if you are looking to sit in an open airy space to see all the action surrounding, if you are looking to have unobstructed views to people watch, if you are looking to taste decent food then the new location of Crop Bistro is the place to try.  The ceiling to floor windows, the vaulted ceiling, the large mural over the bar, and a retro analog clock on the opposite wall, are all sights to enjoy as you chow down on libations, salads, steaks, and other non-meat dishes.  The ambiance is well suited for medium to larger parties  With all these good things, I must have caught Crop on an off night.   Crop's menu has a wide variety to offer.  Our dinner started with  Cherry Bomb -  an appetizer of Plum Tomato, Chorizo Sausage, Jack Cheese.  This was a nice combination of taste and texture. The we followed this by  Ohio Ribeye & Braised Short Ribs.  Although the Smoked Mushroom Barley in my short ribs was too intense taste, the short ribs were carefully cooked to maintain a good balance of light fat and meat. The ribeye was made true to order.   The food is good but for the price point, the food could be better in comparison to other establishments of the same price point.  I am hoping this is work in progress.   So how did I catch Crop on an off night? For a Saturday night dinner with prior reservation we felt we were stuck into a corner on a very small and uncomfortable table. Our kind request for a potential larger table was met by straight No from the host who clearly had a chip on his shoulder.  There were several 4 person tables available unreserved which were seated upon by 2 people parties almost immediately after our arrival.  Our table was so small that even the waitress had a hard time placing our drinks and appetizer at the same time. There is most certainly a significant open space here that truly doesn't warrant such cramped seating. The wait staff seemed they must have been yelled at shortly prior our arrival. None of them, not a single one, had even a slight hint of a smile on their faces.   I will give Crop Bistro another try, the next time, I'll try a different time different day.  Looking at other reviews,  my experience may have just been an oddity, and I'd really like to see if the next time is any different."}
{"text":"I've been here twice for special dinners and I loved it! I just adore the atmosphere of this former bank - the architectural details are eye candy. What can be an architectural delight can also be a challenge. If you are looking for an intimate dinner, this may not be your destination. This architectural delight with beautifully adorned and very high ceilings is gorgeous, but because of those ceilings (and the sheer size of the dining area), be prepared to walk around the table if you want to have a conversation with your dinner mates. The dining area is lively and can be very loud.  Food quality is excellent. Calamari is fresh; roasted beet salad is a delight. For entrees, I've ordered their specials, for which my memory fails me. I can say, however, that I've loved everything I've had!  Service was wonderful. I'd love to check this place out for lunch or brunch!"}
{"text":"Wow this place is so grand compared to its old location on W6. The restaurant's current location is on the corner of Lorain and W25. The tall cathedral ceiling & design remind me of a church but this building was formally a bank. The place feels very spacious and open. However it gets a bit loud since voices travel all over due to the building's acoustic character.   Anyhow, I went here with a large group of people for a birthday dinner and found that not only was this place able to accommodate such a large group (~16) they were able to do it well. Our party all arrived at different times, but once we had the orders in, the food came promptly and all our meals came out at once.  Many people recommended to start with the balsamic popcorn but I decided to go with the calamari. The calamari was cooked nicely with light/med breading that was golden and crispy. It didn't taste rubbery nor was it mushy. It was served with sweet and sour sauce.   For my main, I ordered the ribeye steak. The steak was generously sized and had a nice sear to it. However, it was more towards medium than the medium rare that I ordered. Despite being a bit overcooked to my liking, it was still a tender and flavorful steak. It was topped with tomato salad and blue cheese. Usually, I'm not a fan of blue cheese, but it all went well together with the steak and tomato salad.  I would definitely return here perhaps for their Sunday supper special."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for awhile and come Mother's Day, I got the chance.  My attentive husband got the idea (through tirelessly dropped hints) to book dinner for us here.  It's a fancy place, so we were both \"dressed to impress\" as they say and also a little worried as to the reception of our little noisemaker (AKA our beloved child).  But not to worry, the place was packed with other tiny tots who had also decided to take their mommas for  a \"thank you for letting me stay in your uterus for 9 plus months\" dinner prize.  We fit right in.  The first thing we tried were the scallops and they were not only delish! but beautifully-plated. I could not control my tourist demon at this point and promptly started snapping photos of this culinary wonder while my husband calmly ate his dish and pretended not to know me.  Even the one year old grabbed a spoon and banged it on the table as if to say; \"Like, really?\"  Really?\" Aren't you going to eat the thing?\"     Then we moved on to entrees, mine was quail and, once again, i was impressed.  Presentation and taste both received high marks.  My husband got the lamb and that was less superlative although certainly not lack-luster.    And let's not forget the cocktails; being parents of a \"lively\" toddler, we drink alcohol every chance we get (just kidding) and we opted for their fancy cocktails.  I don't remember what mine was called (it was a light mint-green color) but my husband's cocktail really hit the mark...in fact, it was Marker's Mark so that makes sense.    And oh yes, let's not neglect to mention the DEcor...oh la la, is this a salon in the Palace of Versailles?  I think I was staring at the gilded ceiling like a country bumpkin when the beast, I mean our beloved child, managed to pull a plate of the table for it to break in a resounding crash that reverberated through the large space...I was pretty sure they'd sternly run over and tell us to control our child...but the waiters only smiled serenely as they swept up the shards...Sorry! So, yes, do go to Crop Bistro,....if only for when you are feeling a little Greek and want the amazing acoustics for smashing those plates (please really, no, don't do this!)....it's good food and we will return."}
{"text":"Almost everyone else reviewing Crop has already sung its praises and I really can't add anything new other than my experience. As you will see, it pretty much echoes the sentiments of other reviewers.  First a little tip: If you are going there on a Saturday night after 6 PM and you plan on eating on the early side (like 6 -  6:15 PM) you can save on parking as the metered spaces on Lorain road are free after 6 PM on the weekends. We parked just on the other side of West 25th.   Crop Bistro is not only amazing to look at (the interior and its expansive, high ceiling is a draw in and of itself),  but the food and service is awesome as well. Everything is top-notch and five star all the way. After dinner we took a tour of the vault downstairs (just ask at the desk and they will arrange for one of the staff to take you down there).  If you are looking for a unique and excellent dining experience, look no further than Crop Bistro."}
{"text":"Went here for a rehearsal dinner and it was fantastic. The view from the top floor is awesome and the food was great. Mad props to the bartender, Crystal, who is second to none."}
{"text":"The cocktail menu is the highlight of this restaurant. If you want the best drink and the best atmosphere in Cleveland, this place is not to be missed."}
{"text":"Crop is the BEST restaurant built inside an old bank that I've ever been to!  In all seriousness though..I had a very good experience here.  When you first walk inside the high ceilings and vintage style of the structure make an unforgettable impact.  The use of the space as a restaurant is very creative and I heard you can even eat in the old vault!  I didn't get a chance to see this, maybe next time.  The service is excellent and the comfort I felt from the time I walked in to the time I was seated gave me the feeling that I could order something out of the ordinary and be pleased with my decision.  I ended up ordering the chicken and waffle lunch which was absolutely delicious.  It came with a side of Swiss chard that complemented the meal perfectly.  If I'm in Cleveland and not in the mood for something on East 4th Street this is my first choice!"}
{"text":"I really like crop.  It's actually been about a month since we've been there, and ever since I've been telling myself I need to write a review. We actually ended up there sort of by accident. We were trying to hit up a family restaurant a little too late on a Sunday and they were closing as we walked in. Instead, a friend I was with suggested that we try this new place called Crop. They had a Sunday menu which was a flat $25 for a multiple course meal, including dessert (yesh!). Also, there were choices for the entree, as opposed to a set menu.   The owner and chef is serial restaurateur Steve Schimoler, who apparently has started a bunch of restaurants across the country, is self taught, a former big industry food exec and a creative chef. I read most of that on their website, haven't met him. A big plus for this restaurant is they have a dynamic menu and they are a big proponent of buying local.  Anyway on to the food. The two things I like most about this menu were the high class comfort food they offered and the portions of the food.  High class comfort food: Looking at the Sunday Menu, they had items like Ribs and Mac and Cheese, but still expertly prepared (my friend got the ribs). They base the idea of Sunday dinner on available ingredients after the weekend rush, so that menu changes at the last minute and can have some great surprises. I ended up getting NZ lamb and my gf got swordfish and gnocchi, so there is still a lot of great food left on Sunday for all!  Portions of the food: If you look at the prices of the normal stuff on the menu, you'd probably assume you'll be eating smaller, European style portions, like at most fancy restaurants (you know, where you eat all the garnish, even if it isn't edible?). But that really isn't the case. The salad is family style and generous, the main course was too (my gf had probably about 1/2 lb of swordfish on her plate) and there are also tons of fresh veggies as a side dish (or whatever they are serving that meal, we happened to have tons of delicious zucchini and asparagus). Then after you're full from all that, there's great dessert (we had a no-bake cheese cake...the crust was amazing).   My favorite (and the rest of our parties' favorites) was by far the salad. Like I mentioned above, it was a family style serving, with so many different types of produce, it was hard to keep track. Let me tell you, everything in it was delicious. This is where I believe a good portion of the buying local comes in, and I will say \"Go Ohio!\" (or wherever that stuff was from). I'd go back just for that salad and my fellow diners would agree with me.  The only downside to the entire evening was the drinks. 10 for a mixed drink is a bit much for me, even if they are \"signature\". They were good, but not $10 good, so we stuck to one round. Bonus though, was that the waitress ended up inventing a drink for my finicky friend.  Overall, very impressed with Sunday dinner. I think this might be the only time I could afford to go to Crop, but I will definitely be back for it soon."}
{"text":"//Finding it// They have a light beige overhang outside, says Crop Bistro in white lettering, there is no sign.   //Atmosphere//  Huge ceilings, very fancy-musuemish decor (yep, thats a word today). Greek and Roman themed. Dimly lit in the evening. Very spacious.   //Dishes//  Pork Belly appetizer - excellent mixture of flavors w/ a potato cake and slaw.  Entrees - Duck Cassoulet - LARGE bowl - with LOTS of beans. The portions are quite big here. Very warm and filling.  ***IMPORTANT: Mojo Braised Short Rib - they put red pepper flakes in the dish, but is NOT listed in the ingredient list, if you are NOT into spicy, do not order this. (but my bf says it is quite delicious if you are into spicy)   //Service// Very very attentive service buy all wait staff."}
{"text":"After a long, tiring day, Nathan, Matt, Mina and I were treated like royalty (and we are not) and all made food orgasm noises over the Mr. Figgy, Popcorn, Duck, Scallops and pork chop.  I am not going to waste valuable time, that you could be using to get yourself here, to describe all the reasons this place is where you should be eating.  Just go and experience it for yourself."}
{"text":"What a nice meal! The food was excellent, especially the cheese selections and the flatbread appetizer.   If you order the cheese plate, save some bread for the fruit preserves. The bread itself is very well done, soft with a crispy crust, but not mind-blowing itself.  The faroe island salmon was also delicious. The texture or the quinoa nicely balance the moist, flaky fish.  Meanwhile, the tart sauces were an interesting, innovative pairing.  The fish comes out well-done, so if you prefer your salmon any rarer be sure to let your server know.  The maple cream dessert was delicious, with maple, coffee, and liquor.  However, I am still unsure whether the gelatinous nature added or detracted from its quality.    Also, note that the cavernous nature of the room, while providing impressive scenery, amplifies all sound.  Service at times was slow.  However, if you're spending a extended period of time in Cleveland, I would recommend a visit."}
{"text":"Everything at Crop Bistro is grand in scale. But, the grandeur of Crop is not nearly as impressive as the perfection in its small details. It's like a pointillism painting with perfectly round and evenly spaced dots.  I visited on my 11th anniversary as a special meal. It lived up to the hype. The cocktails were fantastic. The Mr. Figgy was delicious. I usually turn up my nose to excessive uses of bacon, especially in drinks, but the candied bacon garnish enhanced the drink very well. The New Fashioned, (yes, I like bourbon), was familiar but had a great spicy twist and vibrant orange and cherry flavors without losing the bourbon.   My wife is unable to drink, so the bar prepared a mocktail for our special occasion. She absolutely loved it. It was really well prepared and thought out instead of the usual citrus explosion mocktail. And, it was visually interesting too.  Many of the food recommendations in other reviews are spot on: basalmic popcorn is turned-up snack food. The deviled eggs with prosciutto were great and looked great.  The entrees were simply fantastic! The pork chop was the ultimate comfort food. The pairing with cheese grits meant tons of flavor. My wife finished the whole thing and she usually doesn't deviate from steak and potatoes. I had the veal chop, which was perfectly medium rare. The sauce and fried potato combination was so good that I threatened to lick the plate. (Etiquette? Fanciness? I laugh at you!)   Most of all, the best part was the attention from the staff. Our waitress, Mary, was always right by our table when we were ready for her and gave space when we needed it. Plates were cleared promptly and our meal had a very pleasant pacing and flow to it. Everyone on staff worked hard, yet effortlessly, to make sure our meal was a great as possible. (They succeeded.)  Crop Bistro is pricey, but it's well worth it. The attention to the entire dining experience makes it one of the best values on the Cleveland dining scene. It's money well spent on a lot of perfectly executed small details that add up to one grand night of dining."}
{"text":"The food, service, wine list are outstanding. Easily one of the very, very good restaurants in Cleveland.  The setting is quite stunning, if a little overpowering.  This place is made for a big party of 6-12 people.  If it's just two, I would recommend eating around the bar area to the right of the entry as you come in, or on the upper level next to the glass.  If you are sitting on the ground level, you feel like you just were dropped into Grand Central Station.   I had the pork palliard which was quite good and very inventive. Pounded down white pork, on a bed of grits, and cilantro/veggies. Great fall/winter dish."}
{"text":"Update numero tres... is that allowed?   I hope so because this is a different Crop, but the same in all the right ways.   I can't help but agree with yelper Brandon I's review completely. I took two of my traveling colleagues (Chicago and Orlando) here for a meal and it made me feel so proud to live in a Cleveland. I don't know what their reviews are going to say yet, but I will say that their plates were empty. A good sign, right?   The perfect cocktails, the balsamic popcorn I remembered, and entrees still on par with the quality of the original location. But wait... in a new, huge, glamorous space that really does suit the equally huge flavor of the cuisine. Fabulous.   Don't get me wrong. I loved the coziness of the old space and was a little skeptical after reading some reviews. Maybe it was a difference in where I was seated, but I didn't feel on display at all. In fact, I felt in awe the entire time of the ornate ceilings and gorgeous decor. Does it make sense that it still felt simple as well? It just did.   Either way, it was an incredible meal with incredible company in a strikingly gorgeous new venue with the familiarity and quality we've all grown to love in Crop's food. Win."}
{"text":"Went to crop with group of friends. The food was good, i wasn't blown away, but the service was excellent and the drinks i had were fantabulous. The drink was the Gin Ginger Gimlet, probably drank four of those. I really enjoyed me dining experience at Crop and I would defiantly be a returning customer."}
{"text":"My wife took me to Crop for dinner before a play. I'd heard a lot of good things about it.   The space is simply massive.  You can't help but be in awe of 40 foot ceilings and plaster embellishments.  At times I found myself staring to the point of distraction.   But of course we came for the food.   We started with the cherry bomb, the tobacco calamari, and the pork belly.  The cherry bomb was interesting although I think I was expecting a bit more flavor.  It consists of two tomatoes filled with cheese and chorizo.  It's then wrapped in a light skin and deep fried.    The tobacco calamari was great.  The flavor of the sauces along with some lemon zest really made it pop.  The pork belly was good but the soup-like sauce was a little bland although the assorted beans livened it up a bit.  The pork belly itself was good, but not great.  For our entrees my wife had the ribeye and I had the rack of lamb with Israeli couscous.  The couscous was fun and lively with a nice blend of flavors coming from the fruit bits in it.  The lamb was good but not the best I've had.  It was, perhaps, a little under-seasoned.    We didn't have room for dessert but maybe on the next visit.  Overall it was an enjoyable meal.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Thursday night to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. We had a 7PM reservation at the Chef's Table for the tasting menu, and it was pretty empty inside when we got there. We basically had the entire Chef's Table to ourselves! We immediately noticed the beautiful ambiance, wide open space and grandeur of the restaurant.  Our food was served with attention to timing and service. We were never rushed through any course and our servers explained all of our dishes/wines thoroughly which we appreciated. They even threw in an extra course & wine pairing because the chef made an extra dish by accident. All of the dishes tasted fresh and delicious. It was a really special experience to look into the open kitchen and see our chefs make our meals in front of us. My favorite dish was the HUGE seared scallop; my boyfriend loved the Berkshire pork chop.  Overall, the dinner lasted about 1.5 hours and we had an excellent experience. Price for the tasting was very reasonable considering the quality of the food and the wine pairings. I would recommend the chef's tasting to anyone for the value of the experience. We will definitely come here again to try the brunch that is getting rave reviews!"}
{"text":"Boy they sure didn't have restaurants like Crop when I was growing up in Cleveland.  The open, high-ceilinged space really sets the right atmosphere.  I started with the Beet Salad, which actually had enough beets (it is a pet peeve of mine when restaurants stuff their beet salad with everything but - I mean they can't add enough of the ingredient that costs $1/pund?).    My wife had the deconstructed Nicoise Salad, which she reported was excellent.  I rarely get chicken at nice restaurants, but was handsomely rewarded with the tasty mole sauce and the red tortilla corn.  And the Pretzel Unlogic dessert was good enough to please even Donald Fagen!"}
{"text":"Everything about the restaurant experience here was well done. Valet dudes held the door for my gf and I which was not necessary but well appreciated. The building itself is an old bank and is a throwback to a different time when everything was well built and opulent, tastefully done. The murals on the walls, the oversized windows, the atrium; you almost feel like you're eating in a part of Grand Central Station or something.  Onto the food:  We started out with a variety of three cheeses (goat, sheep, gouda) accompanied by jams, jellies, crackers, bread, mixed veggies. Delicious, well balanced.  GF had the pork tenderloin. I don't dine on swine but she seemed to love it. She said it was perfectly cooked and had some great grill marks on it, sitting on a bed of Corn Risotto, Poblano Pepper Relish, and Ranchero Sauce.  I had the grilled ribeye with heirloom tomato salad, blue cheese, confit red skins and fingerlings. I had it grilled medium and it was cooked to perfection, the tomatoes added some nice zest and contrasted the meat well. Right on queue the red skins soaked up all the excess juice of the steak and were seasoned nicely.  All in all just a great job, the service was also great!"}
{"text":"Dinner at Crop.  Started out with the Balsamic Popcorn.  I've had it before, and I think it works fairly well as an appetizer, but I don't think it's the be-all end-all that some folks have made it out to be (though I think everybody should have it once).  Followed that with the Crop Cassoulet, which I thought was extremely hearty and fantastic--duck confit, pork belly, garlic sausage, white beans, and tomatoes.  While the restaurant is moving to the West 25th area, the space Crop is currently in is very inviting with a trendy but very casual feel to it.  I think the service could improve in terms of speed and attentiveness, and it's tempting to drop a star based on this.  With such a great food, though, I'm definitely a fan."}
{"text":"WOW is all I have to say about this dinning experience! We started with the truffle popcorn, it was amazing! The bread and butter was surprising delicious! My boyfriend got the steak special and I got CAB ribeye (and normally I hate steak) we both were beyond satisfied with our dishes! It was slightly expensive but it was for his birthday so it was worth it! I would recommend Crop for fancy events or a nice night out."}
{"text":"Great spot to be on a snowy night as it wasn't too busy.  Started off with the Cherry Bomb appetizer that is unique and really tasty - it's a hollowed out tomato with sausage stuffing and then fried.  I tried the pasta & scallops special as well and that was excellent.  No room for dessert this time but I'll try to save room next visit."}
{"text":"Crop Bistro is an interesting place.  It's high quality ingredients, with an eclectic menu that can be hit or miss if you go there with picky eaters.  That being said, our party loved it.  A well prepared meal with excellent presentation.  The owner/chef came by to garnish some of the dishes and to check on everything.  A meal in any other city would have been twice as much, and not as good.  For next time, I will be sure to try the Balsamic popcorn which everyone raves about."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, but very expensive. We got bread with honey flavored butter, Crispy Calamari, Braised Short Ribs (only complaint is that the potatoes were almost raw), Grilled Veal Chop and the Under Construction Dessert: Honey Mascarpone Cheesecake, Vanilla Bean Caramel, Candied Black Walnuts, Sweet Bourbon Pearls.   The inside was beautiful as it used to be an old bank, but it is pretty loud."}
{"text":"Was there for Sun brunch so maybe options were limited but I found it really over-hyped!"}
{"text":"Went for apres-lunch appetizers and drinks.  Service was good, food was above average.  We had the Tuna app (made with very high quality tuna) and liked it very much.  The deviled eggs were a nice treat as well..."}
{"text":"Hey, that massive, empty, airy, bank would be a really cool spot to overtake with this amazingly fresh and pure restaurant we have going on. YES!   I adore old structures that have character and emptiness behind them that are brought back to life with amazing concepts, buzzing people and glorious (thank you Jelena Z) food. Cara L said while we were in her hood, we could not miss checking this place out and I am glad we didn't. It was a true treat. Everything delivered to the table looked, and tasted, amazing.   I started with the pear cocktail and it was so refreshing I could have had 8 of them with room for more. I started with the house salad and it was full of greenery, flavor and zest. The table also had balsamic drizzled popcorn and it was a nice choice. I went with the specialty pumpkin ravioli for dinner and I basically licked the plate. Delicious. Also, great service which just solidified the fifth star.  I would have loved to even just grabbed a drink at the bar, which I heard is packed during happy hour. If you are around this area and don't hit up Crop Bistro, it's really and truly your loss.  Thanks Cleveland for showing us how food is done and thank you Cara L for bringing us here =)"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant, great service. Menu is creative, presentation gorgeous. Pretzel unlogic dessert unbelievable!"}
{"text":"They have a cocktail called BeetNyk, which is garnished with dill and is sweet. And yet it somehow all comes out delicious and very unique and well-balanced.  I also had the Bloody Devil, which includes chipotle and a devilled egg. And then there was the Maker's New Fashioned, with the namesake ingredient, chipotle, cinnamon-cured cherries, and oranges.   Balsamic popcorn and corn-shaped cornbread were excellent.  The local Bibb lettuce salad, which was very simple, fresh, and nicely presented. I also ordered the Devilled eggs, 3 of which were dyed pink with beetroot, and each one had a little tuft of prosciutto stuck in the middle of the yolk.    They sent a pineapple-ginger popsicle for dessert. And I had some of their Crop blend black tea, which was good.  Server was friendly and helpful, and so was everyone working in the kitchen, who chatted a bit in between their work."}
{"text":"A group of us went for a birthday dinner and everything was top notch. I don't see it on the menu anymore, but the chicken and waffles were the best I've had yet!"}
{"text":"Holy god, delicious! I'm in town for work and searched for a restaurant on Yelp. Found this gem. Also found out it was restaurant week ($30 prix fixe). Everything was amazing: -Seasonal take on a gin fizz (with fresh ingredients and egg whites) -turnover with goat cheese, caramelized onions and truffle oil (flaky and gooey) -shrimp D bowl: thai style, a little spicy with cooling coconut milk, fresh julliened carrots and peppers  -waiting for the pumpkin strusel. I might die of fullness  And the ambiance: decor is a little cheese, but the lighting is nice, it's warm, and the music is nice and quiet. Perfect for dinner conversation... or for eavesdropping."}
{"text":"It's great to see old buildings & architecture preserved, repurposed, and come back to life.  It's even better to see it done well.  Lunch here was a treat.  The menu had plenty of options, and I struggled to pick.  The roasted turkey open-faced on cornbread, with sides, was yummy.  I thought the prices were very fair, given the creative, excellent food, and the locale."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Cleveland.  The atmosphere is great and if you are a hometown boy (or girl) you have to make the trip!  So much culture and history in that building alone and they did a great job preserving that!  Best duck I ever had and the cocktails are definitely unique and first class!"}
{"text":"Love the interior design of the building! I heard it used to be a bank before it turned into a restaurant. The staffs are nice and very helpful. I loved their steak. It was better than the ones I tried at other steak houses!"}
{"text":"Where to begin?  So many problems with this place. From mouse droppings on the floor to cockroaches scurrying around and a hair in the salad and grease on the menus. Needless to say we had to leave, didn't wait around to see what might be in the entree. Gross!"}
{"text":"The New winter menu just came out, so I can't double check all the items we ordered yet. My Chicken Confit did not seem like a confit, more like fried chicken with crispy skin and slightly dry interior (white meat part). Before I ordered, I asked the waiter to tell me about the confit and all I got was \"it is one of the best items on the menu\", no info on how it is prepared. It came with some baby carrots and a farro side dish which was very tasty and filling. The Short Ribs pot roast style was very good, 3 people had the pasta in a pesto cream sauce with shrimp- very tasty with a light, slightly dry pesto cream coating the pasta along with about 6 large tail on shrimp. The ribeye with mashed potato and fried sweet potato chips- 2 of us enjoyed the steak. One steak came out cold and was quickly replaced.  Pretty much cooked as ordered. Service was good, very accommodating. Foie gras app was way over cooked. Inside of restaurant is spectacular, plus you should ask for a tour of the vault"}
{"text":"The food is consistently good and-well presented at this Ohio City neighborhood restaurant. The dining room is situated in an old ornate bank interior with a stunning ceiling and impressive columns and windows. Unfortunately this sometimes causes the noise level to be louder than desired, particularly when the place is busy. Really enjoyed the Happy Hour $5 drinks and apps. Very well done-Try the mini Cherry Bomb (sausage stuffed tomato), deviled eggs and calamari-all were great."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten at many Cleveland restaurants, but my gut tells me, even after just one visit, that Crop Bistro is like the crème de la crème.  Service was fabulous, ambiance super cool, food amazingly fresh (and local), and of course the company I was with didn't hurt either.  My party of three shared balsamic popcorn, flatbread, brussel sprouts, and carrots. In addition, I cleaned my plate of lobster and mango lettuce wraps.  Everything was delicious!  There were a handful of other creative menu items that looked amazing as well, so I'll have to go back to try more next time I'm in Cleveland!    Crop is truly a gem - thanks for sharing one of your faves with me, Cara... I trust your taste any day!"}
{"text":"After experiencing the original Crop Bistro on West 6th Street, I was hoping the new location would be just as great. Unfortunately, my experience was less than satisfactory.   It began when we walked in the door with a hostess that was not the friendliest and did not communicate clearly what was happening. We had reservations and were on time, but she wanted us to wait even though our table was ready...? The co-host relized this was odd and told us to follow him to our table. Strange.  When our server arrived, she informed us they were in the process of reworking the menu and did not seem enthusiastic about the selections. Our server also lacked any manners or knowledge of how to serve food or clear plates. Plates were served directly over the heads of people at our table, not a peep of \"Excuse me\" or \"Pardon my reach.\" It felt like we were in her way.  Of the menu items, we ordered: Balsamic Popcorn appetizer Cherry Bomb appetizer \"Tobacco\" Calamari appetizer Roasted Beet salad Ohio Ribeye Cherry Chipotle BBQ Ribs  The food was average - some items were good and others were far below average. I felt all of our appetizers fell short - the cherry bomb lacked flavor and was mushy, our calamari was bland and the popcorn was stale.  The salad was not a salad but rather a small portion of beets with orange segments, goat cheese and pistachios. For being the most expensive salad offered, it was disappointing.  The ribeye was decent and cooked properly, but the Brussels sprouts it was served with were cooked to death, mushy and without flavor. The ribs were decent as well, but nothing to come back for.  For being in an old bank building with a very dramatic 2+ story space, the lighting was poor and no thought was given to highlighting the unique architectural features of the space. The walls consist of large archways with no lighting to add drama and interest to the space. It was like the restaurant moved in without giving any thought to the space and ambiance. Highly disappointed with the lack of care given to the space.  The crowd was definitely the over 50 scene (maybe over 60). Our table was the youngest and we're all in our mid 30's. It felt like we were eating in a retirement facility. Sorry, but we were hoping for a more lively crowd.  For the high prices of the menu items, I expected much, much more. If you're looking for a tasty, fun and hip dining experience, look elsewhere. Sorry Crop, but we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"The Cropicana bowl is a must. Sooo good. And the inside is gorgeous! It's an old bank!"}
{"text":"I'm sad to give Crop only 3 stars (or actually 3.5 if I could). I had been looking forward to eating here for a while, but when my boyfriend and I went last Friday night for a date we were a bit underwhelmed.  The restaurant itself is truly gorgeous as everyone else has said. It's loud, but in the lively and good way. Location is great. We started with a few cocktails and took our time, enjoying the views and the atmosphere.  The food itself is what was underwhelming though. We started with the scallops and the burrata.  The burrata was disappointing to be honest. The inside was just not as soft and creamy as it should have been. Both appetizers tasted good overall, but just good.  For entrees we had the Quail and Braised Short Ribs. Again, both tasted good by all means. Neither wowed us, seemed very special or creative, or was done to some perfection that took it to a new level though.    Maybe my expectations were too high, I'm not sure though.  There are other Cleveland restaurants I've found that have impressed me more.  I'm sure I'll be back at some point, but not in any rush- and when I do, I'm more inclined to come for happy hour and just sit at the bar and enjoy some drinks and the view."}
{"text":"I have heard a lot about this restaurant, from the good food to the unique interior.  I made a Friday dinner reservation to check it out.  Although the interior is very nice and speaks to the splendor of the classic architecture of the bank that the building was made for, my first clue that something might be amiss is that it was relatively empty.  I could have walked in and got a table on a Friday night, not a good sign.  We got to our table, received our menu and water. And waited.  And waited.  There were multiple waiters and waitresses walking by and standing around.  No one stopped by our table.  The last straw was when a couple was seated right next to us, and immediately had their drink orders taken.  We asked to see the manager.  He arrived and we expressed our frustration about being ignored.  His response could not have been more apathetic.  He did not offer to have someone wait on us, he was not the least bit apologetic.  He did ask what he could do to make it better and we asked for a refund on the $7 valet parking fee and left.  I really don't like posting negative reviews but this was the worst example of customer service I have experienced in many years.  I understand that mistakes can be made in service, but if a manager does not respond in an apologetic manner and offers means to rescue the experience, that is a fundamental error in customer service.  Needless to say I will not be back and cannot recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Yeeeahhh... I'm gonna go against the grain here.  While Crop offers a fantastic fine dining experience in a beautiful building and impeccable service, they disappoint where it matters most: the food.  Wait, that's not fair to the appetizers we had, which were admittedly amazing. We had their Asian-inspired calamari... very stringy, crispy calimari topped with aioli, slaw, seaweed salad, and drizzled with a couple unidentified sauces. It was a brilliant take on a pretty standard dish, and probably the best I've had. We also had the oddly named cherry bomb app, which likely intentionally had no description on the menu, but I had to try it out of curiosity, and I was not disappointed. Don't quote me on this, but I want to say it was a crispy fried egg roll wrapper wrapped around a tomato, stuffed with juicy ground meat, on a bed of cheesy polenta, and some kind of green and red sauce to the side. Best I can do. All I can say is the taste reminded me of a cheeseburger... slash taco. I don't know. It was good.   The delicious 1-2 punch of appetizers we took to the palate probably raised our expectations for the entrees, but that still doesn't take away how unsatisfied we were. I had the Cavendish Farm Pheasant, she had the Braised Short Ribs. It didn't take long for me to come to my conclusion about both of these dishes... they tasted no better than cafeteria food. Mine tasted like, well bland chicken. Hers tasted like pot roast. Cafeteria-quality at that.  Our dessert was equally disappointing... The pretzel unlogic, way too thick, rich chocolate custard on a super salty, impossible to cut, pretzel crust.  So yeah, I don't see myself coming back for a meal here. Just not worth it. I do recommend the aforementioned appetizers if you do find yourself here, but that's it. 2.5."}
{"text":"Loved the restored building. Good appetizers. Really liked the deviled eggs and cherry bomb, which is a stuffed tomato. Then it goes down hill from there. Did not like our snooty waiter, Omar. We ordered dry Chopin vodka martinis with blue cheese stuffed olives. Asked it the olives were hand stuffed, because I can't stand the pre-fabricated kind. The waiters response was surly and off putting. I was given a snooty speech about how all their bar condiments were house made and that of course the olives were hand stuffed. He seemed like it was such an imposition that I asked. A simple \"yes, they are hand stuffed\" would have sufficed. My friend ordered the walleye fish fillet special. It was very over cooked. She ate one bite and mentioned that it was over cooked and he said he would tell the kitchen, but we never heard another word about it. My rabbit dish was over salted. This Turned out to be an expensive and disappointing evening due to the bad service and issues we had with our entrees. We won't be back. If you want good service and great food go to Pier W instead."}
{"text":"I was blown away by the venue here. An old hotel that is simply mind boggling, breath taking, and unbelievably gorgeous.  I felt transported into a time of old when men were men, and three lunch martinis were the business meetings of choice.   Since I was meeting a date, I thought I should wait to have a drink-but I didn't.  The drink I had had candied bacon accompanying it and I was FLOORED.  I could not believe how complex the flavors were, how perfect the bacon tasted, and how ingenious this drink was.  MMM...I need to drag friends there.  Or just go. Like now. We shared two appetizers and they were both unbelievable.  I loved the cherry bomb and the beet salad hit the spot.  I cannot wait to come back and have a full 4 course dinner (yes 4 indeed 4) with 4 cocktails.  I will not be driving.  I'm just saying!"}
{"text":"What a great meal and great place. When I first read about Crop I was intrigued by the concept, but a bit skeptical, as I wasn't able to visualize many of the menu items from their descriptions.    Six of us went there for dinner tonight -- and we all had a fantastic time. I thought the martinis were especially tasty: vibrant, fresh, and creative without being hokey. I really enjoyed the Slanted Cuke Martini. Being a sucker for shochu, I had to get it. It was light, refreshing, not too sweet, and went down waayyy too easily. I sampled a couple of my dining companions' drinks as well: the Bloody Devil and Mr. Figgy were both exciting drinks.   What's all the buzz about the balsamic popcorn? It's all true. It really is --delicious, unconventional, imaginative. I wasn't sure what to expect when we ordered it, but every single person at the table devoured it. I don't dare go into detail as to its preparation, because I feel some folks may be scared off by it. Let's just say if you're a foodie -- you're likely to enjoy it.  For an app, I had the Braised Pork Belly --- phe-NOM-enal! Light, crispy only-in-the-way-pork-fat-can-be-cripsy, unctuously divine. If you eat pork, you MUST try this. The Foie Gras = delicious, the deviled eggs = delightful. And the portions were nicely sized as well. Oh, and their herbed biscuits with honey & black pepper butter were luscious as well.   On to entrees -- I had the Chicken Fried Park Farms Chicken & Waffle. I almost NEVER order chicken in a restaurant -- but chicken and waffles, how could I resist? The chicken completely surprised me. It was juicy, tender, and really tasty. I also enjoyed the green beans and Maple Demi. As for the waffle, IMHO, I could have lived with a lot less herb (rosemary?), a touch lighter batter, and a crispier waffle -- all in all, the dish exceeded my expectations in terms of overall taste.   I am very fortunate in that my dining companions are very generous and encourage trying each other's dishes, so I was also able to taste the Seared Scallops (outstanding), Cherry Chipotle Ribs (yummy, even for someone who's luke-warm to chipotle), and Thai D Bowl (very zesty). But I have to say that the star dish tonight was indeed the pork belly.  Dessert course was also quite good. We had the Pretzel Un-Logic, Some Like it Hot, Mint Chocolate Frappe, and the Salted Caramel Affogato. The Frappe was my favorite of the bunch. I found the flourless chocolate cake to be scrumptious, but did not enjoy the accompanying jalapeno ice cream. The flavors just did not come together for me on that one, but I do give them points for taking risks. Somehow I had it in my mind that maybe a basil/kaffir lime ice cream might be interesting... and I've been dying for someone to make a creamsicle with carrot sorbet and ginger icecream... but I digress. BTW, the coffee there was actually decent. First time in a loooong time that I've had an appetizing cup of coffee in a restaurant. Oh yeah, and the server found out that we were celebrating my birthday, and he was so thoughtful to bring me a cup of cinnamon ice cream with caramel with a candle in it -- that was delectable (the ice cream, not the candle).  I am usually a rather harsh critic when it comes to dining out. I realize it can be difficult waiting on a group, but I have to say that Crop's staff did an OUTSTANDING job in terms of creating a warm, friendly environment with beautiful ambience, timing our dishes to come out together for each course, accommodating food allergies. I can't remember the last time that I had service that well executed. And I'm not talking about the stuffy, old timey server etiquette of ensuring that guests are not served back-handed or folding your napkin into a swan when you get up from the table. I mean they definitely had the basics down (when to clear, replacing silverware, putting down your drinks and plates gently, etc)... but most importantly, the staff seemed sincere in their commitment to good service, and earnest in their commitment to the quality of the food.    I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a meal this much. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is worth the price of food itself. By moving into an old bank building in Ohio City i can only say this place got better! There is more sitting, a huge bar, and numerous private party rooms, including the best one in the Vault. The balsamic popcorn is to die for along with ANY drink from the bar.   If you have clients or want to impress- Crop is the way to go.   The menu changes seasonally so be sure to check out all the delicious offerings."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time yesterday for brunch with a group of friends. They only offer the brunch buffet which is fine because it's amazing. So much great food. Snow crab legs, shrimp, lobster salad, all kinds of salads and fresh fruit plus the typical breakfast items. Everything was delicious. However, our table service was atrocious. For buffets you typically don't need much but no one came by to take a drink order or see if there was anything we needed. Ever. We got coffee from the person doing that for all tables but never saw a waiter until we asked the manager for help. We needed things like salt, pepper, butter for the crab legs. Then had to search twice more for the waiter to get a check and then to come back and pick up the check. I'm not sure if they forgot to assign a waiter to our table or what happened but it was awful. I would go again though because brunch was so delicious and a large selection."}
{"text":"I've been to Crop twice. I loved it the first time, and the second time a bit less so.  My first visit was to their old location in the Warehouse District. I actually preferred the space there than in their new Ohio City location (despite the fact that I love Ohio City). Their old space just felt cozier.  My first visit was with my partner on a Sunday. They had a fantastic family style Sunday menu. Everything we had was amazing. And the cost was incredibly reasonable. The food was of very high quality and was extremely fresh. The service was great too!  The second visit was with a large group for a luncheon around the holidays. Unfortunately the service was lacking on this visit and the food just didn't seem to be of as high quality as on my first visit. That may have been related to the busy holiday season and our large party, but it was a bit disappointing.  With that being said, I would absolutely go back to Crop and recommend it to others. It's a unique and very worthwhile place to checkout! And if you go be sure to try the balsamic popcorn. It's unbelievably delicious."}
{"text":"Great meal.  All 4 of us rated our dinners outstanding.  Two of us ordered the corn ravioli with shrimp, one ordered salmon and another the pasta of the night.  Our server, Deena, was super and guided us perfectly. The place is elegant and located in a former bank building.  The high ceilings make for a noisy experience, but I wouldn't trade the beautiful setting for a quieter evening.  This is one of the best restaurants in Cleveland and we hope to return frequently."}
{"text":"Very cool spot. I took my dad here for Fathers Day several years ago and I've been back several times since. If you are looking for an upscale restaurant that a foodie would approve but, your whole family would like these are the guys. They have a great Sunday special if my memory serves me. I had a brownie with habanero ice cream here that I still think about."}
{"text":"I like the inside of this place. Very cool vibe. Service was pretty good (although I ordered ginger ale and got club soda). The food was all what I would classify as ok to pretty good. Nothing was bad, but nothing was particularly great either. The amuse was a shrimp and cucumber dish. It was fine. I felt like it was missing something (be it heat, citrus, something). The foie gras dish was tasty. Not the best I've ever had, but good. The deviled eggs were disappointing to me. It seemed like all they did was add chile powder to them. That alone does not justify $4 for an egg and a half. I got their barbeque ribs. The ribs were fairly well cooked. Not as good as a top notch BBQ joint, but decent. The sauce was ruby tuesday quality. The mac and cheese it was served with was kind of bland which was disappointing to me. It is pricey for the quality you receive. $40 for an appetizer and an entree. Meeeh..."}
{"text":"Cleveland has really great places to eat, Crop Bistro is one of them. I'm vegetarian and I got the Asparagus Salad with grilled tofu (I ordered the tofu, though not on the menu at the waitresses suggestion) it was wonderful. My asparagus was cooked perfectly!  My husband got the Thai option, also vegetarian. He liked his meal as well. We also got the cheese plate, which was nicely presented and tasted very good.   There are a few veggie options on the menu but it does seem that they can substitute easily with the grilled tofu if you'd like to do so.  The location is spectacular. The high ornate ceilings and the art is really exceptional to look at while eating here. If you're seeking to impress a date or your in-laws this is the place to do it.  The down side, it's really expensive. So you better be in love with the date your impressing because this place will set ya back a few. I've found it to be one of the most expensive spots in the CLE.  I don't know if the pricing is really that necessary but the food was good, so maybe it's worth it... I'm still deciding."}
{"text":"outstanding restaurant.  food is fantastic- fresh, seasonal, sharp, compelling, well balanced.    terrific service- a warm, knowledgeable staff who really seem to want you there and have fun.    try the balsamic popcorn, the fried chicken and waffles, and the artisinal beer."}
{"text":"Tonight we started with the 3 prosciutto deviled eggs and absolutely loved them. Both of the ribeyes that we had were also delicious. We couldn't get enough of the mushroom Demi!   We will surly be back ASAP."}
{"text":"What a find. We stumbled on this place on a visit to Cleveland. Met the owner and chef on sat to get the gist of this place. Came back on Sunday for the supper and loved it.  The food was fresh and different. I Had the salmon and my wife had scallops and some fish.  Both had just the right flavor and texture.  And the portions where just right.    Service was good. Everyone seemed to really enjoy the place.  Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Best-all around. Each dish we got was super tasty (calamari, cherry bombs, walleye) and drinks were yummy (sugar plum martini) and service with impeccable and atmosphere was gorgeous. You can tell the chef Is passionate about each dish. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I love this place. Their food is delicious, their service is usually pretty good. The location is great but you will probably have to valet. The building is incredible! It is located in an old bank. I've heard of you ask your server, they will take you downstairs to the old vault but I've never done it myself!"}
{"text":"We have been to crop bistro a few times over the years.  In general it was a nice place with good food.  But last night's experience has changed our view and needless to say we will never be back.  We arrived on a Friday evening at 5:30. It was not busy at all.  A couple tables of people in the main area and 3 people sitting at the bar.  We sat on the bar side to see what the happy hour was like.  There were 3 in our group.  At 1st everything was fine.  Server/bartenders were pleasant, drinks were good.   We tried the flat bread with sausage and peppers as an app since it was a happy hour special.  It was fine.  My husband and 17 year old liked it more then me.  I wasn't a fan of the burnt stuff on the bottom of crust.  But to each his own.   As an entree I ordered chicken parmesan.  Again I thought it was ok, not the best.  It was different in that it had a piece of thigh with the bone in it and not breaded just pan seared it looked like with cheese on top and sitting on pasta.   The sauce had a different taste, not your typical marinara.  My 17 year old had the lamp chops.  The server said they usually prepare them medium rare and asked if that was ok and he said yes.  When they came they were well done!  I was shocked they even let them leave the kitchen!  I mean not even a spot of pink on these chops!  So we waited for the server to cone back and when he did and asked of everything was good, we pointed out that the lamp was well done.  He took it back and said he's sorry and he would get another.  It was a quick interaction with him and one that seemed appropriate.  When the chops were returned, long after my hubby & I finished eating and our plates were cleared, the manager brought the chops back (at the time we didn't know he was the manager), red headed guy.  He just set the plate down and said here is your lamb.  He walked away.  The original server came back within minutes to check and see how the lamb was.  And this time they were cooked rare which was fine. We never heard another word from the manager.  When we got the check we were surprised that after sitting an extra long time and having to wait for the good that it was on the bill.  The manager never even said sorry when he dropped it off, never offered a free dessert like you would get at any other restaurant when they make a mistake. Nothing.  Mind you, we were late to a party where we were bringing the cake.  So I asked the server why we are paying for the mistake.  He got the manager.  The red headed guy came up to us and was so rude from the get go my hubby and I were shocked!  He started off by saying, 'im shocked you asked for a free meal when you ate the food.'.  I asked if he was a manager because of the way he approached us, he said yes, so we responded with 'well that's more shocking!'. Then he said 'well you ate the food and you never said or had a conversation with me about it!,.  Wait what!? 1st off you walked away after dropping off the remade one and didn't even offer an apology, let alone a conversation.  I had no idea I had to converse with you more about your restaurants screw up.   He kept going on as though we were trying to get away with something!  I said to him, do you really think we walked in here and somehow made your restaurant overcook the chops just so we could get a free meal or at least be treated with some sort of respect for choosing your restaurant and you making us sit here longer then we anticipated.  Again, he never said sorry.  But he did take the chops off.  We went in for a nice dinner and left feeling miserable.  Never going back.  There are way to many nice restaurants in cleveland that treat their patrons much better then this."}
{"text":"Had an amazing experience here tonight! We had a party of 15 for a business meeting in the conference room. The room was great and the service was incredible! The hostess, Ursula, was so accommodating and helpful to us. The bartender was perfect (I didn't catch her name).  We had a planned menu of appetizers, salad, main dish, dessert. I had the truffle crustini that had a light drizzle of truffle oil and a crisp crunch. Loved!  They served a wedge salad with delish blue cheese! I chise the salmon bc it had ginger and coconut. The rice was perfectly seasoned. Finally, for dessert I chose the panna cotta. I liked it. I wasn't too keen on the freeze dried fruit in top. Overall, this place is gorgeous and the staff is great! I would suggest it to anyone!"}
{"text":"The dining room is beautiful being in an old bank building. The food is creative. Each dish had its own blend of flavors from foie gras with lemon pound cake to beef short ribs slow roasted with quinoa. Nothing short of great food with great service to go along with it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here to have dinner for our anniversary. He made reservations beforehand and I guess he told them about the occasion- they welcomed us with 2 glasses of sparkling white wine. That was pretty nice.   We sat at the Chef's table and that was a perk in itself. We got tuna tartar, as well as a chocolate pretzel custard for dessert. Both were great. On top of our appetizer and entrees, we were both stuffed.   The app and the entree were ok. First thing you notice is the larger portions. very good sizes. We got the pork belly app, which wasn't what I wanted it to be., but still good. I got the short ribs- which was the major downfall of the meal. I was expecting short ribs to be tender (because as we know, they are a fatty piece of meat), but instead, they reminded me of stew meat. I had to actually use my knife to cut them. The polenta served along with the short ribs were quite creamy and delicious though.   My boyfriend got the ribeye, which was smoked to perfection. It had a nice bacon-y flavor to it, which we found out after asking the chef, turned out to come from smoked mushrooms!   All in all, we had a nice dining experience. Great customer service and hospitality."}
{"text":"Crop is certainly a place to visit. Combination of flavors and texture is genius. Cherry Bomb & Deviled Eggs apps are amazing. Chicken and waffles are a must; Yellow Fin good as well. Unfortunately I can't remember the many drinks we ordered, Twisted Vine is worth a try. Cropper Nutter: If all the desserts on the menu are this good, I will try them all. I'm still wondering (4 wks later) why my rib-eye was tough, therefore the absence of the fifth star..."}
{"text":"On a business trip to Cleveland. Searched for a \"Farm to Table\" restaurant with a good cocktail menu.   First to know, I showed up at 9:00 pm on a Thursday and it was totally dead. I had a reservation with the last seating scheduled at 9:30... so I figured 9pm would be okay, but.. would recommend an earlier service.  Ended up sitting at the bar. I had some old-fashionesque cocktail which was quite nice. The bartender was nice, but not very knowledgeable (she also seemed to be giving the vibe that she'd rather be somewhere else). I noted that they boast a long list of Rye's. I asked about one or two of them (was interested in trying a new micro-rye), they were in fact not stocked at the bar.   I ordered a beet salad for a starter. The salad was good but copious (read enormous). I had a pork chop and some greens for my main (I think) .. the entree was forgettable.   All in all I had the feeling that they were not that engaged. The food was adequate and the cocktail ok, but no real passion for either."}
{"text":"I had been here last year for lunch and the quality has gone way down since then. It seemed like they were out of at least half the beers on the menu. The Cuban sandwich was dry and lacked flavor and was served on a hoagie bun.  The salmon was mediocre and had a weird combination of flavors that didn't complement each other well.  Our waitress was nice, but she didn't seem to know much about the menu.       Once I have a bad experience with food at a restaurant, I won't go back. Even though the location and ambiance are nice, I won't eat here again."}
{"text":"Crop is great for all the reasons listed by other folks.  My experience has been, however, that the food is dramatically better in the non-winter months, when a wider array of fresh local produce can be obtained.    Also, every once in awhile, the chef and/or bartender really misses the mark on flavor.  The \"new-fashioned,\" for example, with its muddled chipotle peppers and cherries, is legitimately disgusting.  The jalapeno ice cream they served with a chocolate cake dessert last Fall was amateurish and poorly-balanced.  Finally, and I know there will be those who disagree, but I find the chicken and waffle entree to be a disharmonious melange of unfortunate flavors.  That said, Crop has a white bean and rock shrimp entree that is one of my favorites in the entire Warehouse District."}
{"text":"My first experience at Crop was absolutely lovely.  The pork belly appetizer (with tomatoes, potato cake, arugula, the tiniest of frites and aioli) was delicious and generously portioned for two.  The lamb chops were divine (ordered as suggested: medium rare) and complemented perfectly by the orzo with roasted vegetables, herb salad (parsley and mint I believe), and eggplant puree. Seriously, so flavorful.   The fella' had the ribeye with roasted sweet potato wedges, tomato salad and blue cheese. At medium rare, the steak was perfection and we also ordered a bottle of red wine, suggested by our server, which accompanied our dishes well.   Speaking of our server, he was excellent - unobtrusive but present at those exact moments you wanted him to be.  I certainly hope to return and give the tasting menu a try!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere and location are both KICK ASS. It's awesome, I want to LIVE in this restaurant! There were oversized photographs of fruits and veggies on the walls and cool stained pine paneling throughout. Atmosphere was sort of the swanky business lunch crowd, and it was pretty loud. Service wise, I was pretty un-impressed. Our waitress was quick and efficient but pretty cold and un-friendly all together. Hmmm, who knows, maybe a bad day. NOW ONTO THE GOOD STUFF.  We started off with the infamous balsamic popcorn. Yes friends, popcorn. It was strung with purple onions, arugula, (unfortunately) red pepper, some Parmesan cheese and drizzled with a hot balsamic dressing. My parents: Loved it. Me: Ehhh. It wasn't as great as the hype, I think the texture (and the red pepper, blegh) got me.   For my entree I got the seared scallops with toasted Israeli couscous.  The couscous had red grapes, shaved fennel, cucumber, arugula, and a mint vinaigrette. The scallops were cooked PERFECTLY. As for the couscous - I have never been a huge fan of couscous in general, but I liked this (especially with the scallops). The grapes were perfect and the cucumber was a great idea as well, everything was really fresh. Apparently because everything that they cook is made from local and fresh ingredients. Dope right?  My dad got sauteed seasonal vegetables and rice, totally his style, not mine. He loved it because the vegetables were so fresh and the portions were SO huge.   My mother got a caprese sandwich, which of course i had to try. It was on ciabatta with fresh tomatoes, mozzarella, basil, arugula, balsamic and herb aioli and came with a mixed bean salad on the side which tasted like it had prosciutto and fennel in it. My Brother (none too adventurous in the food department) stuck with a plain kobe burger and reported that it was \"good\" and \"well-cooked\". It also came with the same bean salad but he didn't eat it.   Now lastly -- dessert. Which could truly be my favorite part of the entire meal. Salted Caramel affogato with vanilla bean ice cream. Jesus - salted Caramel + Hot Espresso. Oh my lord I just about died twice while savoring this ish. I cannot even talk about it.  All in all, a great place. I had a good time and a great meal. Honestly I'll probably be returning within the month..... affogatto.."}
{"text":"I'm at a loss for words reviewing Crop, because I just love it too much. It's like writing your own marriage vows...how exactly do you put so much emotion into words? The first time we had dinner here a few years ago, the pork belly appetizer left me speechless. It was that dang good! The cherry bombs are consistently yummy and you can't go wrong with any of their short rib preparations. The pastry/dessert chef seriously kicks ass - she whips up some of the most delicious, fun and inventive creations ever to grace a dessert menu. There's always so much wonderfulness to enjoy at Crop, and it's always hard to save room but you absolutely must. So many amazing food memories...it's very hard to recall them all! And oh yeah, everyone should order the Mr. Figgy cocktail at least once. I mean, you'll probably want to order them all the time, but you know... self-control? Haha. No. Just go to Crop and enjoy."}
{"text":"Great Dark & Stormy cocktail with good ginger beer.  I had the \"Cherry Bomb\" appetizer which was a tomato stuffed with chorizo and cheese, fried in a Wonton wrapper. The truffle popcorn was good.  The hanger steak was perfect medium rare. The potatoes were a little under done. The \"Some Like It Hot\" dessert, a flourless chocolate cake with jalapeno ice cream was divine.  Two thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"Nothing amazing and nothing bad to say. I went on a quiet night and everyone was polite. The menu is pretty small and select, which I prefer because thats typically a sign it's food they specialize in. The food was good, as was the bread and butter. Why the lower score? Because I spent $50 (by myself for Rib eye, potatoes, bottle of beer and tip) and I thought it was a bit too expensive."}
{"text":"Crop does a special meal on Sundays where the first and dessert courses are set but there are choices for the main course; the prix fixe is $25 (plus drinks and popcorn).  Also, it promotes using local produce, which I admire.   The salad course was good, though it featured not one but two kinds of beets.  Not being a beet fan, that was a drag for me; but Jessica loves them so she was happy.   The other elements were great, particularly the fresh mozerella cheese.  I chose the chicken with cheddar and pancetta for the main course.  Very good, but a bit heavy.  Jess had a delightful salmon; our daughter had a wonderful ravioli with gobs of veggies; our friend had some scallops that were as well prepared as any I'd ever had.  Crop does serve a set side with the main course and getting something that complements the six or so different choices would be a challenge.  In this case, it was a rice pilaf that was  pretty good but a poor match for our four choices.  It was too heavy for the chicken, inappropriate for the pasta, and odd for the scallops.   It was a good choice for the salmon actually, but one out of four ... well ... still, if the side is the only complaint, that's not bad after all.  They also offer a popcorn as an appetizer.  It changes every night I guess and ours had parmesan cheese, basil, and truffle oil.  Yumm!  For dessert there was a peach buckle with whipped cream.  I was full so I took mine to go but had a bite of Jess's and it was quite good.  All in all, I'm glad we went and enjoyed my meal very much.  Crop is in the Warehouse district that, like the E. 4th St. area, is a very small strip, but is trying to lead a renaissance of Cleveland proper.  I hope it's successful."}
{"text":"Good solid 4 star, but no way for 5. Frisee salad was good, but the dressing was a little of the heavy side. Truffle popcorn was tasty, although we all kind of missed the truffle flavor. The chile deviled eggs were very good, and spicy. The cherry bomb was good, but lacking a little flavor compared with the deviled eggs. Flank stead was taken off the bill, which was very nice of the server, the dish was ordered medium and came out blood rare. 2 of us had the short ribs which were excellent. Could have used a little more horseradish, but the ribs were done to perfection. Fried chicken with waffle is another good dish. The waffle is smaller than an Eggo, and the fried chicken is 2 pieces of boneless breast that are fried. While the dish itself was good, the syrupy sauce that was poured over the waffle and chicken was a little heavy for my taste. I guess you can ask them to keep the sauce on the side, which I think would help. We skipped dessert , but there was really nothing that stood out as a \"must have\". Good service, good food, pretty noisy and prices are reasonable. Valet parking is only $5, so you can't beat that."}
{"text":"The decor of the place is beautiful. I liked that it was a bank prior to being crop bistro. We had reservations at 8 and got there a few mins early so we sat at the bar and had two martinis. We ordered the pear ones. The bartender said that they were a mixture between sweet and sour but they were plain bitter. I didn't mind it but it was far from what I expected. We sat down at 8 and our server was Kathleen. Very nice, attentive and personable. She seemed to know what was going on, which we appreciated.  I liked that the menu was small as it can be an overwhelming thing when you are in a place like that. The items can be a bit pricey but it's a perfect place for a special occasion.  We ordered the deviled eggs as an appetizer.  They were good but a bit too salty. For dinner we had the scallops.  They were so tender and so perfectly cooked. The leek was a great touch. Another thing we ordered was the pasta of the day. Very well portioned for a pasta dish. The meat was so perfectly cooked, very tender and just the right amount of seasoning. I didn't care for the ricotta on top. I feel that goat cheese would have been a better choice of cheese but then again it could be a preference.  We had the pear dessert (wish I could remember the name but it was so long and elaborate). It was made to order so it was warm and really delicious. The ginger ice cream and the gelatin on the side were perfect as well, nice touch to balance the sweetness of the dessert. A great experience. One of the best restaurants in the CLE area in my opinion."}
{"text":"Crop v2.0:  I've seen it before. Small business owners with grandiose visions, moving their operations to a larger space with bold expectations to outperform the previous space, ultimately setting themselves up for unachievable goals. Growing too much too soon has ruined many. I just hope that Crop's recent move to W. 25th and Lorain isn't another example of this tactical failure.   While I'm not too familiar with all the reasons WHY Crop moved from one of the most homey, comforting, warm and inviting spaces in Cleveland's culinary landscape, I do know that their new space is a stark contrast to everything that we've come to know before. The new space? Cold and cavernous with intimidating Romanesque architecture. Gone are the soft, velvet tufted booths, whimsical chandeliers, warm colors and farm-like wood accents. Gone is the pictorial theme of a farm's bounty of fresh, locally farmed ingredients created out of a glowing open kitchen with vintage copper pans hung overhead. Replacing the previous space are 40 foot high ceilings, large cream colored brick walls, pillars that reach from the hard surfaced floor all the way to the intricately ornate ceiling. The space previously occupied by a bank is now home to 8,000 square feet of open floor dining.  So ominous, so intimidating, so museum-like that upon entering, I just wanted to run to the bar in the corner and hide. And judging by everyone else, so did they. By the time we were done, there were more people that chose to sit at the bar than sit in the dinning room. People were actually intimidated to sit in the grande dining room. I saw them refuse the offer multiple times. We sat right next to the hostess station.   We were early for dinner that Friday night. Somewhere around 5:30pm. It's impossible not be in awe of the space Crop has overtook. But after the initial \"ooh's and ahh's\" are through, I started to get really sad that the Crop I grew to love will never be the same. We were offered a table. And since there were very few others there, it seemed as if we were dining in an airplane hangar. You could see every corner from any location in this grande open space. There was no room to hide, relax  or be intimate with our soon to arrive meal. Perhaps paranoia set in, but it felt like we were on display at all times. And the music selection? Odd. Think Enya and department store music. I'm not sure who designed this place, but I'm pretty sure it was the contrarian evil brother of whoever designed the previous Crop. The design is opposite in every way.   But other than the decor, the food still seems on point. There are even some holdovers from the previous menu like the Cherry Bomb and Cropper Nutter. But for some reason, I just didn't have that outer body foodie experience like I used to have at old place. It just isn't the same. The new place is not romantic. It's not warm and cozy. It's not anything like the previous space. It's cold and off-putting. And for that I'm very, very sad. There is something to be said about the effect food has on you in it's relation to your surroundings and ambiance during which you eat. And in memory of Crop v1.0, I will always remember what once was........ and sadly, is no more."}
{"text":"Came to this place because I couldn't get into Great Lakes Brewery and I heard good things. It was more expensive than GL but dang was I glad I tried it out.    I like how most of their menu is seasonally inspired and comes from more local produce.  I got the crispy pork belly app which was crispy pork belly stacked on top of a fresh corn pancake with pickled apples and green a orange sauces speckled over the whole thing.  It was not what I was expecting, and kind of startling to see corn in my pancake, but it was thoroughly delicious.  I'm a sucker for crazy flavor/food combinations that actually work, and this was exactly that. My entree was an (Ohio City!) pasta dish with roasted brussel sprouts and a sauce made of pureed butternut squash and apples.  Fresh, light, unique, wonderful.  Drink prices were a little high for good, not great drinks, and our service was so-so, but the food was amazing.  The atmosphere is a little noisy from the openness, but unique and easy on the eyes."}
{"text":"Fantastic. Creative American food. Lunch menu is a steal give the quality. Walleye perfectly cooked. Building is gorgeous."}
{"text":"I took my mom here for brunch this past Saturday and I happy to report that we were very pleased overall.  The service we received from Juan was impeccable.  He really took good care of us.  Not to mention, there were lots of food options to choose from. Two minor concerns that I had were that the crab legs were served cold (which may be to the liking of others - just not for me) and that the mussels had been in the server for a bit too long and had become extremely dry.  Other than that, the food was delicious! I will definitely visit this place again."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today after shopping at West Side Market. It was quiet and not busy.  Beautiful atmosphere and music. Our server was very friendly and accommodating. My husband ordered the Pig Mac. Lots of meat, good flavor and a nice little side salad and orzo pasta dish served with it. I ordered the Faroe Salmon. Very fresh, seared and seasoned perfectly and the Quinoa was so flavorful and perfectly prepared. We left very happy and look forward to returning."}
{"text":"Went to Crop before the 8pm Jim Gaffigan show.  Arrived at 6:05, sat at the bar.  Took 1/2 hour to get first appetizer, 1 hour to get the second and our entrees never came.  We left at 7:35 without eating.  Show was a birthday present from my daughter.  Really a big disappointment."}
{"text":"This is my second time trying Tour De Crop.  They claim the menu is changed per season, but I see a LOT of similarities between the two tastings I had last night and last winter, the menu didn't really change much, this discourages me to go back again.   Of all the courses I had yesterday, I think my favorite was foie gras over lemon cake.  The shrimp salad was very salty with overpowering Asian sauce.  The main course (6th course) was beef short rib; however, unlike the short rib I had last winter that melted in my mouth; the one from last night was overcooked, very dry and hard to swallow.  I sat at the chefs table so I told them the meat was too dry.  The chef made us a substitute - walleye fish with rice.  The fish was nice and tender (a very small piece, snack bite size, not entree size); but the rice was under-cooked.  I had to tell the chef again about the rice being under-cooked, and I asked for bigger portion of the fish, since it was supposed to be entree size.  She made us more fish, but the waiter served the dessert before her fish was ready.  So we ended up packing the fish to go.   I specified in the reservation it was my dad's 85th birthday, but they did not prepare anything special for him.  I had to ask for candle and put on his dessert to sing happy birthday for him.      Regarding the presentation of the courses, all dishes look so similar, there was no surprise per say on the presentation.  It needs improvement.   The waiter served water from time to time but he never asked us how the food was.    Desserts are great at both times and they were different at each time.  In summary: 1. Overall food was mediocre.  The courses presentation had too much similarity.   2. Food quality was inconsistent, this is a big no no if you expect customers to come back.  3. Needs improvement to remember customers' notes in the reservation.     4. Assistant chefs do not perform well without supervision of the executive chef.  (I am referring to the food quality, and common sense of entree replacement portion.) 5. I am attaching a photo of the wine tasting I had a  winery in Napa valley, ever dish was a pleasant surprise, unlike theirs that had similar presentations to all of them.  6. Tour De Crop price went up from $65 to $75."}
{"text":"This was truly one of the best dining experiences I've had in downtown Cleveland! I work at a downtown hotel and a few coworkers of mine and I decided to make a regular date to check out restaurants we haven't been to!  Crop Bistro could not have been any better! We made a reservation, and were seated promptly. We had an excellent server that attended to our needs from beginning to end. I loved my cocktail! I had the Mr. Figgy, which i highly recommend! And we loved the wine selection!  We had three delicious entrees: the ribeye which was prepared perfectly MR with yummy creamed spinach and truffled potato sides!, a scallop dish that was to die for, and I chose whatever the special was that evening which ended up being a smoked chicken and cheese filled ravioli w an amazing sauce that kept throwing different flavors my way and i loved every bite of it!  We couldn't leave without having a chocolaty piece of heaven for dessert!  I love Ohio City so I'm super happy they are moving to my favorite part of town and i wish them good luck with their new cropicana on whiskey island!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Beautiful restaurant, great food (had Korean short ribs & chicken & waffles), and good service. Ask for a tour of the vault, if you have time. Very cool."}
{"text":"I have had multiple very nice dinners at Crop- highly recommended! The building is gorgeous and has a nice ambiance- impressive for being such a large open space (I was concerned it would be too loud).  The food was impressively delicious and they do something magical with their bacon.  I had some version of a manhattan with a bacon balsamic garnish and the server overheard me saying it needs two pieces of bacon and the second magically appeared!"}
{"text":"Have been here twice now with the same group, including a friend with a sophisticated palate who loves Asian food, and family members who are more accustomed to comfort food.  Everyone was delighted and amazed!  This time we ordered the deviled eggs with crispy prosciutto, the chorizo stuffed cubanelle pepper (with a piquant red and an herbaceous green sauce), calamari with slaw and remoulade, goat cheese croustades, & balsamic popcorn to start.  The croustades alone would have made me very happy as a lunch!  My friend had the swordfish special & loved the finishing touch of the micro cilantro garnish, & found the fish perfectly done and the shrimp risotto a savory foil.  My usual companion had the chicken parmesan and family members shared the pork chop, both of which were properly executed.  I had the lasagna, and appreciated the toothsome handmade pasta, the bright, super fresh tomato cream sauce, and veggie layers.  A slight hiccup in timing led the manager to comp one of the entrees (ours had been sent to the wrong table).  No room for dessert but I was very intrigued by the offerings.  Of course there is a solid wine list and short but well thought out beer list.  The cocktail menu is fantastically inventive but sadly there are no non-alcoholic options.  The space is a magnificent reclaimed bank building with tall ceilings, murals, and detailed ornamentation, a treasure of the type that most post-industrial cities are losing forever.  The service is attentive and well-choreographed.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Wow! I'm review number 400 for Crop. How cool is that? It seems fitting, especially because Crop continues to be one of my favorite restaurants. Located in an old bank building in Ohio City, Crop has one of the best restaurant ambiances in Northeast Ohio. Beautiful architecture, interesting classic art and exposed bricks are a few of the things that add to the unique atmosphere. Visually, its really a special place. It also has a great location, just off the West Side Market, with valet parking and metered spots nearby.  What is even BETTER about Crop is that the food matches the beautiful environment. Whether for brunch, lunch, dinner or just desserts, Crop has a wonderful and inventive menu of American fare for every meal. For my lunch, my friend ordered the Mac and Brisket with cavatappi pasta, cheddar and braised brisket...and it was to die for. I kept stealing bites. For lunch, you can always count on the Lobster Roll. Its the buttered brioche roll of your dreams with the most tasty lobster ever.   On Saturday, Crop is open until 11pm, so its also a wonderful spot for a fancier late night dinner or espresso and dessert. With great food, great service and a great atmosphere, Crop Bistro is a no-brainer!"}
{"text":"Went Saturday night as a pre-Father's day treat.  Now, the last time we experienced Crop was at its old location on W 6th and it was - as I told the manager - one of, if not, the best dinners I had in Cleveland.  We arrived slightly early for our 7:45 reservation which was fine since there were a couple of open seats at the bar.  Watching the bartenders was quite a treat as they seem to really enjoy their jobs and, like others commented, their drink list is ample and creative.  No issues ordering off-the-wall drinks here.  We noticed a couple of apps and entrees served to bar patrons and they all looked great.  Our table was ready on-time.  The dinner menu was brief though not limited.  This, to me, is typically a good sign since I always wonder how a chef/restaurant can make fifty or more different items in any quality fashion using fresh ingredients.  I think there were six or so appetizer offerings, a few salads and eight or so entrees from which to choose.  Also, the online menus are in-line with the actual menus which is a plus.     We ordered the pork belly, deviled eggs, and briefly mentioned we were going to share the beet salad.  This is significant since the salad came out already nicely split amongst two plates - something some restaurants won't even do if you ask for it.  The pork was awesome with its cherry sauce.  I can't comment on the deviled eggs that much since they're more my wife's thing and the beet salad was great.  For the entree, the lamb was spectacular though my only wish would have been for it to be served with a fresh vegetable of sorts.  The rack chops were served medium temperature which, to me, is ideal for lamb.  The server didn't inquire as to my desired doneness when I ordered and, I guess in retrospect I understand why; I suspect a lot of patrons would reflexively order it well-done which would be a shame.  The rabbit pappardelle dish was also very very good.  Again no complaints here.  If I were to make one criticism it would be thus: the restaurant is loud.  The four-cornered room coupled with the wall materials simply reverberate the internal noise.  It's not deafening but I was speaking with a gentleman briefly who was in a party of six and he said the person accross the table basically had to shout his conversation.  Not a place for those with sensory hypersensitivity disorders!  I think this could be rectified with acoustic dampening on the walls - not my field though.  I get the theme - wide-open space but, unfortunately there's a bit of a grand-central station feel to the place as well.  I don't go to a restaurant for a spa feel so it didn't bother me that much, but, I suspect others might get turned off and not return despite the amazing food and drinks.  Finally, the bill was definitely reasonable at around $120 including drinks.  Reading a prior review someone was upset about $28 for an Ohio ribeye.  Really?  Last time I went to Whole Foods steak was upwards $20 a pound *raw*.  For $28 you get it cooked to perfection with accompaniments - not to mention locally-raised.  This isn't Texas Roadhouse and even there, a ribeye is over $20.  I don't mind paying extra for local, freshly-prepared (read: not pre-packaged) foods and sauces.  Keep up the good work Crop and stick to your mantra of fresh."}
{"text":"The food at Crop is great but the service completely ruined the night. Awful! We were at the restaurant for over 4 hours. Service was slow and poor. We will not go back due to the poor service."}
{"text":"We had dinner here one evening. I love the architectural vibe of this place! An old converted bank building! They simply don't build buildings like this anymore!  I had the Waldorf Salad and the Braised Pork Belly. Both were sublime - elegantly presented and oh so good!  Afterward, we got the tour of the basement area - used to be a bank vault. All of the bank vault door hardware is still in place. Crop Bistro uses the area for special events, parties, etc.  Service was very good! I will be back at some point!"}
{"text":"There used to be a restaurant not far from crop named halite. So named for the artificial salt product manufactured in Cleveland and distributed on icy roads.  Our meal at crop was similarly flavored with a very heavy handed salty taste.  The soup, rice bowl and Mac n cheese were almost uneatable save your money and spend it on fresh ingredients at the west side market"}
{"text":"Whoa, I didn't know what I was missing. I'd never been to Crop because it seemed a little stuffy for me - maybe it's that giant bank building location & the slightly elevated prices - but I was wrong. Though it is, yes, in a giant & ornate old bank, with prices a bit higher than I usually go for, it's also totally worth it & not at all stuffy - just a really nice, positive, delicious dining experience.   I've been twice now, once just for drinks & another time for lunch. I loooove their Mr. Figgy cocktail - fig-infused Bulleit Bourbon, sweet vermouth, maple bitters, & a giant piece of candied, bruleed bacon. Whoa. For lunch, my mom & I had, between us, two salads & two entrees which we split - the beet salad (so colorful & fresh!), the Brussels sprouts salad (that maple dressing!), the Cropicana bowl (the shredded pork is to die for), & the three-grain bowl (so healthy AND so flavorful). I'm blown away by the flavors, the freshness, the creativity... everything is incredible, from the food to the service to the locale.   Only suggestion: Bring a sweater. It gets drafty in that big, old bank building!"}
{"text":"My wife, her mom, and I went to dinner there. Of the three of us, I was the least excited. I thought the food was good, but not outstanding. A lot of the dishes were close to excellent, but had one aspect that wasn't quite right.  For example, my lamb was very nicely done, but the reduction sauce was a little too overwhelming (reduced too much?).  With my waffles and ice cream dessert, the waffles were undercooked and mushy, which kind of ruined the idea.  The only food dish that was poor was the mac and cheese - all three of us thought it was very bland.   But my big complaint was the service. At $50 a person in Cleveland, I expect excellent service and it wasn't. Our server had a table of 10 next to ours; I don't know if that was the problem or what, but she was not nearly attentive enough and service was kind of slow.    My mother-in-law was drinking coffee with her meal and we were almost done with the entree before the waitress even checked if she wanted more, and then, brought her a fresh cup but left the old, dirty cup on the table.  She did that with a lot of things - bringing new silverwear for the next course, but leaving the old silverwear on the table.  By the end of the meal I was annoyed.  I will say, the restaurant is beautiful, and then did a great job converting the old bank and the \"space\" is probably one of the most beautiful in the Cleveland restaurant scene.  It is one of the few high end restaurants that doesn't seem crowded.  But given the service, I won't be back any time soon."}
{"text":"I was under-impressed with the Crop Bistro.  The open-air restaurant is so beautiful. It used to be a bank, and they kept some of those elements when they transitioned the space into a restaurant.   In terms of the food, I've had better.  I had salmon with a veggie root cake.  The salmon had a little bit of a fishy taste, and not much seasoning.   Our meal ended with sweet potato \"pudding\", which was more of an overly rich cake.    The space is great for a large business function or wedding.  It's worth trying for the ambiance, but the choices in food we made were not up to our expectations."}
{"text":"The new building... reminded me of a cafeteria.  Or a warehouse.  Reminded my girlfriend of a cathedral.  It could be romantic in it's own special way, somehow?  Eh?  The food... fabulous.  The flatbread appetizer was very tasty and the black vinegar added a nice touch.  The short ribs were fall-off-the-bone delicious and the fondue mac had just the right amount of cheese.  And the salmon was cooked perfectly.  Also, our waitress was excellent and very attentive.  My mouth is watering as I'm writing this.  I'm definitely coming back.    I just wish it didn't feel like I was eating in a cathedral."}
{"text":"yum. yum. YUM! I've been here twice, and each time was fabulous. Crop is a perfect example of why I LOVE being a clevelander. We have the best restaurants! I cannot remember the cocktail that I had, but it was bomb. I can imagine that any cocktail they'd have would be a good choice. The grilled figs were amazing, and original. The chile deviled eggs (i know what you're thinking - deviled eggs???) are sooo good and totally different from your typical mayo/mustard eggs. These were incredible, spicy, and topped with prosciutto. The chicken and waffles (which is one of my favorite meals) are amazing. The waffle is small, but just enough, and it has that perfect malty flavor that you hope your belgian waffle will have. The bacon maple syrup - well, do I really need to elaborate on that? The pork pallard is awesome, and super flavorful. The ribeye was probably one of the best steaks I've ever had. The lamb chops were cooked perfectly and served with a delectable couscous. The cherry chipotle BBQ ribs were good, but I honestly thought everything else was way better. The service is top notch, and the building is GORGEOUS. My only complaint: they really need to improve the acoustics. I wouldn't go here with someone who is hard of hearing, because even people with excellent hearing will have a hard time conversing. Regardless, I can't wait to come back here!!"}
{"text":"I very highly recommend Crop!  I took my partner for her birthday last year.  We had a deviled egg appetizer which was oh so yummy, a lot of stuff inbetween and ended with jalepeno Ice Cream.  The service was amazing.  And we definitely want to go back again very soon."}

I would have to say these were some of the best dishes I have ever consumed and no I am not Liliane Bettencourt who lives a luxurious lifestyle, traveling throughout the world, but the food here was F$cking Fantastic.    I love my Ahi Tuna like my men  \"Firm and flaky\" in texture Crop executed it fully.    oh those Deviled eggs, if Hell serves them let me sin!   and don't forget the beloved by so many Chicken and Waffles- Spiced Savory Maple Syrup topped on pecan crusted pan fried chicken.  That's a slice of heaven on a plate.    Hudson Valley Foie Gras- Cherry Compote, Challah, Cinnamon Honey.  I questioned this at first, boy was I wrong for not trusting the kitchen.  This was \"liver cotton candy\" melt in mouth the flavors synced like my ipod to my teenagers hand kind of dish!   Here is the problem- I live in Dallas,  so now am currently fantasizing about re-living my Foodie \"O\"     Thank you again Crop (Enjoy big flavors  here)  Mary S. Dallas-"}
{"text":"My husband and I are from the San Francisco Bay Area and were in Cleveland last weekend to visit the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and eat at Lola's, which was fantastic.  We're foodies.  My husband is a cook.  I found Crop on Yelp and made a reservation for last Friday night, 10/16/09.  Have to say that we had a perfect dining experience.  The food, service, and ambiance were perect.  One of the best dining experiences we've ever had.  First off, you can get lost in the bread and butter that they put in front of you.  The bread is a soft corn bread and the butter is sweet and creamy and light.  We shared the scallops which were fantastic.  Fresh, flavorful, delicious.  The best I've ever had.   I had the fettuccini with root vegetables, fennel, celery root, and wild mushrooms- as good a pasta dish I've ever had.  It was served in a light miso infused sauce of some kind and was seasoned perfectly.  My husband had the lamb, which was cooked perfectly.  I had a glass of alberino, which was delicious and reasonably priced.  We were too full for dessert.  I'd go back in a second if I was ever again in Cleveland.  We enjoyed dinner at Crop more than we did at Lola's, and we greatly enjoyed Lola's, it's just that Crop was a better overall dinning experience- food, service, and ambiance.  It was about $100 for our meal- I had a glass of wine and my husband had 1 beer.  Just to give you an idea."}
{"text":"The service was some of the best I've had in Cleveland. Four of us, including a 6 year old and a 2 year old loved the popcorn. It's not just popcorn, it's delicious. The chicken was split between the two kids and they each got their own mini waffle smothered in syrup."}
{"text":"One of the best meals ever!!! The food was amazing! Start with the cherry bomb.  Delicious doesn't even describe how good it is!!!  The ambience of the restaurant is spectacular!  Their attention to the details is awesome!  I'll definitely come back next time I'm visiting Cleveland!!! It is a true gem!!!"}
{"text":"LOVE YOU CROP!!!  I have not been here since 2012 but still, bring back the \"some like it hot\" dessert thing (I think that is what it was called) and the Seared Tuna.  Balsamic Popcorn is pretty cool, think Bruschetta meets popcorn.  Deviled eggs, nothin' special.  Calamari was very good, Ribeye was cooked/seasoned perfectly and WAS HUGE!  Mr. Figgy is all you can ask for in a bourbon Libation.  The look and feel of the restaurant screams modest sophistication."}
{"text":"crop.  there's a lot of good things to say about crop bistro.    first off, service was great.  granted we went at an earlier time so the restaurant wasnt as busy, but regardless...service was on point.  the look of the place is real cool.  nice open space, open kitchen...if im correct it used to be an old bank...but dont hold me to that part.  but none the less, its a cool looking place without question.  on to the food.  we ended up getting five plates for two people.  im not gonna' lie, not the smartest thing to do cause i couldnt move for quite some time.  but we wanted to get a good feel of what this restaurant would be like.  we got three apps and two entrees.  for apps, we got the cherry bomb, pork belly, and the scallops.  the concept of the cherry bomb is cool, a plum tomato stuffed with chorizo and jack cheese, deep fried in wonton skins with some corn...was pretty tasty, but my only critique was that i felt that there was too much wonton that took away from the tomato and chorizo...but overall still solid.  the pork belly was probably my least favorite dish, but its more of a preference in how i like eating pork belly than anything else.  the components were good, i just felt like there was a lot going on with that dish.  and lastly the scallops.  scallops cooked perfectly which is always a good thing.  i typically do not like polenta, but this fried polenta cake was pretty darn tasty.  entrees...went with the ribeye and short ribs.  i mean, if you read the descriptions on the menu, should be good enough reason to order them...haha.  horseradish demi...oh yeah.  they were both real good, cooked real well...no complaints there.  overall, this place is definitely worth checking out, its in a good part of town, dont think you'll regret visiting this place at all."}
{"text":"Pure greatness.  About as amazing and beautiful an atmosphere as any place I've ever dined in.  I hear that the old building which now houses Crop is an old bank building, and what a beauty it is.  They just don't make em' like they used too.  The tiled or textured ceilings and huge windows give this place a very unique feel.  What else can I say, tons of awesome beers available, great food, and a bad-A atmosphere, what else do you need?  I had the truffle popcorn which was great, and of course several pints of various Belgium beers that made my head throb the next day.  It's always worth it though, right?  I had the chicken and waffles for my main course, and I actually tried Foie Gras for the first time, because, why not?  You only live once...poor goose...  Anyway, the place is great and would probably be the first or second place I would direct someone for good eats when they visit Cleveland.  I wish we had more places like this in Dallas.  Champ"}
{"text":"I was blown away again last week when I finally made it to their new location. Not just by the food, which was outstanding (get the chicken and waffle), but by the location as well. It is hands-down the prettiest restaurant space in Cleveland. While the soaring ceilings naturally induce neck-straining awe, it somehow manages to feel cozy. Definitely a place to take someone you want to impress."}
{"text":"I don't like it when restaurants try and capitalize on holidays and rip customers off. This is exactly what Crop Bistro unfortunately did. We came here for a thanksgiving meal. Two slender slices (not even full slices) of turkey, cheap helpings of sides, for $30? You can literally buy an entire organic turkey for that price so we were definitely disappointed. Far from the feeling of satisfaction you get with finishing a thanksgiving dinner, we even ordered appetizers to accompany and left unfulfilled and about $150 broker. Oh yea. Service was severely lacking. We were practically thrown menus and couldn't find our server at 20 min intervals. Almost left to try and pay at the counter. All around frustrating."}
{"text":"Bank vault, anyone?!    Yes, there's a bank vault in the basement for group events. You have to walk through the kitchen to get to the dinning space, which was a little disorienting at first, but was a cool experience in the end, as you could see how your food is being prepared and talk to the chefs. The bar section in the back was a little small for the group of people we had (about 50 people) and the acoustics were deafening at times with the marble covered walls. However, once the sauteed mushroom and truffle crustinis started showing up, I couldn't notice anything else but the flavour explosion that was happening in my mouth. After the first one, I literally chased down the server for a second and third. The glass of delicious red Cote de Rhone helped also.    Dinner would not be overshadowed by cocktail hour. The salad was a bit of a bore, but it was perfectly dressed and light...as good contrast to the appetizers. It decided on the Grilled Tasmanian Salmon with warm quinoa salad, fava beans and fennel. This dish was perfect! Four days later, and I'm still dreaming of it! The salmon was perfectly medium, retaining all that is amazing about fish. Meaty and lush, almost melted in my mouth. The fava and fennel complimented the fish well, balancing the fattiness. I was a bit skeptical about the quinoa salad, but it was well cooked with just enough moisture. For dessert I had the coconut cream pie with key lime fruit cavier. I would have love for the coconut cream part to be thicker and more custard like, however the key lime fruit cavier added pops of interest and freshness that made for plenty of delightful mouthfuls.    Not only was the food deserving of 5 stars, the service was deserving of eight! My wine glass never got to below half full and my server was also able to recommend a delicious chardonnay to accompany my salmon main. Everyone was professional, but friendly and a little cheeky at times. Qualities I love in a wait staff because it makes them feel like people instead of robots going through the motions.     This is my first time to Cleveland, and if all the restaurants here are even half the quality and deliciousness of Crop, then why aren't we talking about Cleveland more?!"}
{"text":"This review is for Sunday brunch... All i can say is i felt like i was back at a casino in Atlantic city or Vegas when it came to the spread...For those of you who have never been to said brunch before, think of high end food, in large amounts available all day long..To start you can choose from a bloody mary or a mimosa included with your meal. Then the adventure starts... They have a bread and pastry selection with multiple types of each.. Regular bread, breakfast breads, fruit and tart pastry, cinnamon rolls ect. Then you move to the seafood section. Crab legs, shrimp, seafood salads, a whole smoked salmon, and then they also had a huge amount of fruit and cheeses. Next you have the hot bar with anything from eggs, bacon and eggs bendecit to mussels and greenbeans and crawfish stew... Last you have the carving station with prime rib and ham, as well as mac and cheese and lasagna.. Come hungry, you wont leave hungry.. For 39$ i would say this is the best brunch you can get in cleveland!."}
{"text":"Me and my niece went for the Sunday brunch to celebrate our birthdays. AMAZING!Our server Isiah was fantastic. Outstanding service and a pleasure to talk to!   i can honestly say this is the first time an omelet felt like it melted in my mouth!The eggs were so light and fluffy and the ingredients- it was just outstanding. There was not one item available that was not soo good. The desserts were petite in size- perfect and decadent.  This will definitely be a restaurant on my go to list to impress friends and family."}
{"text":"In my opinion, one of, if not the best restaurant in Cleveland. Delicious and creative, if you ever want to treat yourself, get the chefs tasting."}
{"text":"Every bite I ate was delicious.  Every. Single. Bite.  Let's start with the pita, crudités and hummus.  This classic, common appetizer was my first inkling that the forthcoming meal was going to be something special.  The flavorful, smooth hummus with the assortment of veggies and house made pita chips was a cut above the typical and I could have been happy making a meal from it.  So glad I didn't - because the salad and bread was equally remarkable followed by a pasta in a creamy tomato sauce that was a vegetarian delight!  My dinner companions ordered the salmon and the short rib entrees and were equally satisfied.  For dessert I had the light as air berry cheesecake- a mousse-like concoction with berries blended into the filling and a sprinkling of graham cracker crumbs on top.  Finally, while the building is nondescript on the outside, it opens into a beautifully restored interior that surprises with its expansiveness and retro elegance.    A treat in many ways."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience at Crop on Saturday night. The food was outstanding, and the service was excellent. Our server (Brian?) shared with us the history of this amazing space.  The calamari is to die for, the cheese board is heavenly and good luck deciding on your entree. We were lucky to try many; veal chop, smoked ribeye and the lamb shank. After sharing several delicious desserts, our server took us on a tour of the vault. Definitely a must see! Looking forward to returning soon, especially to check out their new Sunday Brunch."}
{"text":"went to crop saturday night........arrived 10 minutes earlier than our reservations, no problem, were seated right away. the initial contact for a server to acknowledge us was a bit long, but they were busy, but still......too long. we started out with a couple of cocktails, informing our server that we were in no rush to order and that after we were done cocktailing, we'd continue on with wine and dinner.....she was very understanding, very attentive and very unintrusive throughout the night.....which i love! we like good service that is attentive yet not trying so hard to be our best friend or \"work\" us....i get it. started with a mr. figgy, a fig infused maker's mark cocktail served with bruleed smoked bacon for a coctail stir-stick-AWESOME DRINK!!! had 2, in fact, they were SO good......... we enjoyed calamari and the foie gras for our appetizers.....DELICIOUS! the foie gras was buttery-melty with a thin reduction sauce, the calamari was plentiful topped with a sauce, but crisp and deliciously undercooked! our salads consisted of 1 soft wedge, a thick layer of bibb lettuce topped with crumbled bleu cheese, a thick piece of smoked bacon and a white balsamic vinaigrette.....the other salad was the arugula salad....BOTH equally simple, yet delightful!!! our dinners were salmon with mashed asparagus and ahi tuna with smashed edamame. both wonderfully undercooked, moist, delicious and beautifully presented.  skipped dessert because we were so full.........enjoyed a couple of glasses of wine with dinner and had to take some of our dinner in a doggy box to go. that never happens to us!  inside the restaurant is still decorated with much of the original decor of the old bank the building used to house...penzi spices is at the far end of the mammouth dining room, which you can see through the giant paladian (sp?) window.......the dining room does have a tendency to be loud due to the super high ceilings, but not defening........ i highly recommend this great addition to the ohio city restaurant choices......."}
{"text":"We had an overall pleasant experience at Crop this evening. The deviled eggs were as good as usual. My wife and father-in-law had the chicken and waffles. The fried chicken was cooked perfectly. The maple glaze and crisp coating really made the dish. The waffles were okay - they were a bit dry.  His wife ordered the ahi tuna special. I tried it and it was well seasoned, seared, and served raw. Very solid.   My dish was the big disappointment. I had the cab ribeye. I've had it here twice before but it was a summer style preparation with a tomato/arugula salad. Regardless, the ribeye in the past was amazing.  Not tonight. First, it was boneless. Which is usually okay but not preferred. But, the cut of meat was this circular spongy glob of meat. It was very, very fatty and just had an overall strange texture and taste. I sent the steak back. Our waitress was going to prepare another steak but came back and told me that the chef said all the cuts tonight would be the same way. That's disappointing for future diners and disappointing that a restaurant of this quality would not have better cuts; especially considering this was the only steak option.  I didn't order anything else due to the timing and the fact my wife could barely eat half of her chicken and waffles.   After dinner, we had the Baked Alaska dessert which was very good. Then we had a quick vault tour which was very unique and interesting. Much better than I imagined it would be.  Overall the food was good and the service was excellent once again."}
{"text":"Wow... I mean really... Wow.  I sat at the 'Chef's Table' overlooking the kitchen and it was like watching a gastronomic ballet.  Fresh raw ingredients danced through the kitchen and came together to make dishes that were out of this world.  I don't even need to describe it any more than that,  check out the order below.  Btw, special thanks to Owner and Head Chef Steve Schimoler who hooked up an amazing tasting dinner.  I was also here when the new Zagat ratings came out and Crop Bistro was rated one of Ohio's top restaurants.  Totally agree, this place is off the chain!   Tasting Dinner Courtesy of Chef Steve! 1) Lobster Latte which is a drinkable lobster bisque.  AHHmazing 2) Crop Corn with flash sauteed peppers and onions with balsamic drizzle.  Like savoury sauteed popcorn.  nom nom nom 3) Chile Deviled Eggs, Crisp Prosciutto.  To get the pallet ready to rock 4) \"Tobacco\" Calamari, Gremolata, Lemon Basil Aioli (becasue they are cut like long cut chewing tabbacy) 5) cherry bomb with chorizo filling (Stuffed cherry tomato with sausage filling) 6) Cheesy Rosemary bread balls as bread for the table.  Nice and light with some great flavor. 7) Seared Scallops, Potato Puree, Potato Galette, Baby Carrots, Truffle Foam 8) Braised Pork Belly, Gigante Beans, Pickled Veg, Tomato Broth 9) Rack of Lamb, Pumpkin Bread Pudding, Swiss Chard, Bordelaise 10) orange creamsickle float.  Vanilla Ice Cream, Orange Soda, Whipped Cream...   Ughhhhh sooooooo freaking good!!!!!   Beverages of the adult persuasion 1) Makers new fashioned with cinnamon & cayenne.  Shout out to Stevie Jr.  A must have if you like the brown stuff. 2) NASCAR with beer BBQ booze.  Crazy different.  More of a \"Yea I got it\" drink than a \"yum this is great\" drink.  Fun though."}
{"text":"I want to preface this with I am not a real foodie - but I like to eat out, try new things, and appreciate good food and service.  This was my first visit to Crop - on Sunday's they have a 3 course meal for $25 - everyone in our party loved their meals. For a prefix, there were 5 or 6 entrees to pick from - so everyone felt they had enough options. Our group had steak, pasta, and scallops among the entrees - miso scallops were excellent - not one spec of sand. Sauce with just enough \"kick\".   Salad, green beans and mashed potatoes were served family style - all excellent - though an odd combo for green beans/mashed with miso scallops.    Dessert was waffles with ice cream and custard - so good - everyone in our party cleared their plates.   As far as the ambiance - loved the open kitchen with seating and wood walls with windows and photos of food. Just beautiful.  Service was also efficient, high quality and friendly.   Would definitely recommend to friends and family for groups, a special occassion or just a nice dinner out!"}
{"text":"Crop left a great first impression for me by having the nicest and most detailed website for a restaurant that I've seen in a while.  The site is aesthetically pleasing and included updated lists of their beer and wine selections (and their prices too!),   When I arrived for Happy Hour, the hardwood floors and detailed ceramic ceiling tiles (Roman, perhaps) brought up the atmosphere of the Great Gatsby for me. There were a couple TVs placed near the bar without sound (which was pleasant).   Their happy hour menu was smaller than I had expected (2 types of flatbreads, lamb sliders, and crop punch, $5 each). The Crop punch was very good: vodka, stiffly made, and fruity tastes without a sugary taste (unfortunately, our server didn't know what was in the drink). The lamb sliders (2) were small but tasted great. A fluffy and rich bun, with lamb, crumbled blue cheese, and a couple other things...multiple, nice flavors.   Our server was attentive for the beginning half of my stay until a group of +30 showed up and she forgot to return with a refill requested by my friend.   The bathrooms were some of the best that I've seen in a while. Pristine. Some art on the walls. Multiple urinals.   Crop is a great addition to downtown (and west 6th) and especially one that uses food that is sustainably farmed, local, and in season."}
{"text":"Crop has evolved over the years to become a landmark of the Cleveland food scene, supplanting itself with Lola, Greenhouse Tavern, Dante, and Spice Market as restaurants that I would happily pit against the best any other town in America has to offer. Cleveland can take the lumps it deserves for its struggling economy and god awful sports teams, but the food scene is a tribute to the passion and creativity of its locals, and Crop is another shining example of things that are absolutely going right in the city by the lake.  Crop is stationed right in the middle of an old bank building, and it shows in the extensive and elaborate ceiling frescoes and polished stone decor. It's a similar feeling to eating inside a warehouse, except it's bustling with activity and the lighting effect makes your table appear like it's own little planet in a bustling universe of activity. It strikes the diner as old fashioned and posh, bathing in it's own swanky sense of style. I had an old fashioned manhattan here, because.....I should. Servers wear ties, and it seems like the type of place you'd see a local politician or athlete celebrating a special event.  My group was celebrating an anniversary and the holiday season, so we truly attacked our waist lines with the best Crop had to offer. The \"pile of crop\" special for the day was an ohio city pasta dish in a rich creamy white sauce and seared duck breasts. Im a sucker for Ohio City pasta (it's found and the west side market)market, made painstakingly by locals who still give a (censored) and is incredible) so it was an easy choice, and was mind blowingly delicious. The braised lamb shanks were tender and moist, roasted and packed with flavor; the cooks here clearly are used to preparing the shanks and avoided the pitfalls that tend to leave it under seasoned and tough. (The sauce and accompanying risotto were clean-the-plate-with-bread good) The Ribeye (capitalized to suggest badassery) was a prime cut of meat, an inch think, seared and presented magnificently with fresh horseradish julienned and highlighting a rich red demi glace. (I'd happily put it on the level of Hyde Park or any national steak house; the K street haunts that old crotchety DC lobbyists favor would be hard pressed to outperform it)   Service here was fresh and surprisingly attentive given the volume of patrons having dinner on a busy Saturday night, and our young server handled everything with aplomb. I would love to give the food here another round of reviews, but find that their sister restaurant (Cropicana in Wendy Park) is now also overdue for a visit. Such is the Cleveland food scene; always a bigger fish.....or restaurant, however the adage goes."}
{"text":"i have been to Crop 3 times.  Once for lunch this past spring, and twice for dinner the past month -August.  I was not too impressed with the lunch I had 6 months ago, but the place was fairly new.  It was OK, but not that memorable.  Now I am glad to report that we do have a winner here!  I had the Crop Prix Fixe. Sunday dinner that rivaled any place in town.  $25 for a 3 course meal.  A lot of places use Sunday brunch and other such \"specials\" for what is known as \"garbage day\" in the restaurant biz, where all sorts of odds, ends, and leftovers are re-plated and piled onto a buffet for mass consumption.  (Some are really gross) It does not appear that Crop is of that school.  Fresh, creative, and delicious.  Dinner 2 nights ago was terrific.  I had the fried green tomato appetizer with a designer bleu cheese.  Very good.  Light, fresh and tasty.  My date had the stuffed date appetizer, stuffed with prosciutto and goat cheese.  This one was out of the park good.  Sweet, salty, and most importantly, well balanced.  Entrees were very good as well, Tasmanian Salmon was a hair overcooked for me, but any salmon over medium-rare would be for too well done for me.  Very fresh, delicate and tasty.  I had the chicken-fried duck breast with black beans.  It was good, but I'll try some other items next time instead of re-ordering the duck.  It was OK, but a tad bland for me.  The black beans, however, were deliciously seasoned.  Service was fine.  My biggest bone to pick is that the sidewalk seating allows smoking.  Both times the table next to us smoked through our meals.  Both cigarettes and a cigar.  That was nasty."}
{"text":"Had a great meal at the chefs table and watched the chefs cook the entire night.  Our server James was great and did awesome wine pairings, the chef Tom was friendly and always stopped to explain what we (and other people) were having!  The owner Marcello was such a great host, and he came by our table multiple times to check on us.  Wonderful experience and can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Not often in cleveland dining can you say the restaurant had a decedent atmosphere. Dont get me wrong, you can have beautiful restaurants, or hip lighting, throw pillows, etc. Coming into Crop you are blown away at the idea of eating dinner in a atmospherically lit old bank lobby. Even if the food was garbage I would say come here to stare at the ceiling and wall mural.  For the food, it was well prepared, fast and no complaints. With that being said there was nothing to die for. The big standout at the table were the chicken and waffles and oyster soup. The lamb dishes, while cooked well, lacked a level of seasoning. This is particularly true with the lamb shank. The risotto was cooked to perfection and the flavour profiles were dead on with the mushroom and lamb. Yet the bed of risotto overpowered the lamb.  We had a new server, so he wasnt sure on which sauce went with what dish and he seemed a bit flustered during the Thursday dinner service. But the rest of the waitstaff seemed on point. And special props to the hostesses, who talked to my grandma at length about the building and location.  Another true Cleveland jem in the gastropub world. Its always nice to come home to places like Crop. However, aside from the Chicken and Waffles, the entrees left me wanting more flavor."}
{"text":"Crop is the opposite of fussy, pretentious fine dining - it instantly became one of my favorite \"special occasion\" places to eat after a recent Sunday Supper.  My scallops with miso cauliflower puree were excellent, and the other meals I sampled (short ribs, salmon) were equally good.  Our sides were sauteed squash and (thank you, God) mac and cheese, both really delicious.  To top it off, dessert was pumpkin buckle with salted caramel sauce. Service was attentive and helpful without being intrusive and the whole experience was comfortable, relaxed and a little indulgent, just what I look for in a special night out.  I was aware that we were getting Crop at a discount, given the great value of the $25 Sunday Supper; not only would I return another time for a regular meal, I'd actually be torn between that and having Sunday Supper again - I loved the spontaneity  and the X factor of the Sunday menu that much."}
{"text":"Crop Bistro is an amazing restaurant!   First, the decor/ambiance. Crop is located in an old bank building and everything inside is incredibly intricate. There are large pillars that line the walls and the ceiling is beautifully crafted with unique inlays.   Second, the location. Crop is located right at the corner of W 25th and Lorain, which makes it a great spot to grab dinner before making your way around Ohio City.  Third, the staff. All of the servers were very attentive. My water never went unfilled and the cocktails were always flowing. I even told the waiter I would order a drink the next time around in about 10 minutes, and there he was, 10 minutes later!  Fourth, the drinks. Delicious!! I unfortunately can't remember the name of my specialty cocktail, but it was vodka infused with pear. It was amazing! It was just the right amount of sweetness. It was served up with a pear slice garnishing the rim, perfect!  Last, the FOOD! Our table started with the cheese plate and pork belly. The cheese plate was fantastic because it included a few different fruits, jellies, and breads in addition to the  cheeses. It was a great appetizer to share, and it was enough for a group of six people! I ordered the Grilled Tasmanian Salmon. OMG, was it amazing! It was full of flavor and was the perfect portion. Crop has bigger portion sizes than what I was expecting for the type of restaurant, which was a very nice surprise. My boyfriend ordered the Chicken and Waffles, and he was in heaven. The portion on this meal was HUGE! He had half to take home as leftovers.  If you haven't been to Crop, make a reservation for next weekend. It was great for a group of 6 people, but I will be back for date night with my man!"}
{"text":"Astounding environment in a converted bank keeps the restaurant feeling open and somewhat elite. The staff works well individually to each do their part and make each shift a success. The food is also delicious. No viable complaints."}
{"text":"What a fabulous restaurant. It is expensive, but if you want to go out for a special occassion or just don't mind spending a little extra cash when you go out to eat, this is a great place to go to. First, it's beautiful. Very high ceilings with realyl great artwork from when it used to be a bank.  My boyfriend and I showed up on a Friday night without a reservation, but we were able to get a seat in the bar area. Our waitress was EXTREMELY  friendly and personable. She made great drink recommendations when I asked her about the different cocktails, which were $10 each but pretty good.  For an appetizer, we ordered some type of cheese plate, which was good and filling. But, between drinks and just cheese, we decided to order dinner too. We ended up splitting the chicken and waffles entree. It. Was. Amazing. I had never had chicken and waffles before, and this was one of the best dinners I have ever had. The waffles are so fresh--because they aren't made until you order them. Even with us splitting the dinner, it was a huge portion. We each got one waffle and one full piece of chicken. The chicken was so crispy and not over done.  Great food. Great drinks. Great atmosphere. Great service. If you live in the area and never go here, you are so missing out."}
{"text":"Haven't made it in to the new space for dinner yet, but just happened in for lunch on Christmas Eve and was totally wowed by the ambiance. The restoration on this former bank building was painstaking -- it really is a sight to see. Most romantic restaurant space in Cleveland, bar none. Beautiful in the daylight, most likely twice as impressive at night.  That said, the lunch at Crop is fantastic, and impressively efficient and no-fuss. My gluten-free friend was very pleased with her salad, and my mac and brisket was delightful. And the waitstaff have been drilled on various details of the renovation. We know because we grilled our waiter. So ask questions, they know their stuff."}
{"text":"The architecture. Dirty martinis with blue cheese stuffed olives and tasty calamari. No need to bring a date... the food and cocktails will pleasure you."}
{"text":"Was a great place, REALLY having a hard time with three and wish I could do three and a half.   Super groovy place, the decor is cool, the architecture is great, I was just a tiny bit underwhelmed with the prime rib. Had a great taste but ordered med-rare and got barely pink in middle. I could have said something but the flavor was fantastic, plus I was with a large group.   I will for sure be back, just a heads up to make it clear or have a set expectation of your meal temp.   And before anybody comments I am not one to take free food, I ate every bite that was served it was very tasty, so I feel bad for a server that offers another or to take it off the bill.   Had the creme brûlée for dessert and it was amaze balls.   Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"This is our new favorite restaurant for fancy-times. Sean made reservations for the chef's table last Saturday night for our anniversary.   The food - oh MAN the food! We went with the Tour de Crop tasting menu - you can choose from 7 or 11 courses. Would love to try the 11 courses just because the food is that good, but don't think I'd be able to eat it all. Six courses was PLENTY of food and then some. For the 'tour' menu, you must make reservations and they add a 20% gratuity on top.   Course 1: Ancho chili deviled egg - smoky, just a bit spicy, and a crispy prosciutto hunk perched on top. Perfect.   Course 2: Asian grilled shrimp (2) with cucumber/wasabi sauce and a very good slaw on the side. Delicious.  Course 3: 'BLT' - heirloom tomatoes, greens, and fried pork belly. Largest portion of pork belly I've ever had on a single portion. Very very good.   Course 4: Pan seared scallop - this was a latin style with crispy plantains underneath. Very large scallop which was melt-in-your mouth delicious. I don't even like scallops that much and I still thought it was very good.   Course 5: Beet salad - purple and yellow beets with shaved Beemster cheese and a delicious sauce. Good sized portion and perfectly cooked beets.   Intermezzo: house-made mango popsicle - yummy!  Course 6: Korean braised short rib with curry rice and house-made kim chi. OMG I thought Sean was going to need a moment alone. So flavorful and tender. Absolute perfection.   Course 7: Dessert was two portions - one fresh berry/sorbet collection and one chocolate 'reverse s'more' with house made graham cracker and marshmallow. Both were good but I'm much more a berry person. I LOVED that one and Sean really liked the s'more one. For me it was a bit too 'burnt' tasting but I think it's just personal preference.     Slight cons:   Bathrooms just meh and a bit on the small side for as big as the place is.   It's loud - they make no bones about it - not much you can do in a space like this. It's beautiful with VERY very highly lofted ceilings. I found it loud but not ridiculously so.   The chef's table is really just a bar counter surrounding the kitchen. This makes it difficult to sit comfortably on the high chairs (probably an issue only for the ladies in dresses/heels), also there's nowhere really to put your purse or clutch except on the countertop. It's also a bit awkward with this setup to be served - the chef serves you the food from in front of you, but your server comes around from behind you to ask about drinks, check in, etc. and it's kind of weird to turn around in your chair to talk to him/her.  Although we loved sitting so close to the action and watching the kitchen at work, we came home with clothes smelling slightly of grease. Not really bad as at a tempura place or anything....but still.   Overall, we completely loved our experience and will definitely be going back when a special occasion arises. We would definitely recommend the Tour de Crop tasting but probably sit at a regular table especially if there's more than 2 in your group.  Definitely one of the best meals I've ever had with excellent service to boot."}
{"text":"On par with Green House Tavern in taste and menu. Exceptional experience."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. I was there on a date and it was great. The atmosphere is beautiful and both of our meals were top notch. Try the balsamic popcorn...yum, and the salted caramel dessert. If u havent tried this place yet...go and make a reservation. You will be happy you did so."}
{"text":"I visited from Columbus on a very wet and windy Wednesday evening when Hurricane Sandy was blowing, keeping the normal customers away.  So this gave me the opportunity to have a nice chat with the bartender(ess) to get caught up on what's going on in Cleveland.  I had a gin-ginger gimlet for a cocktail, which was just right.  I then had the beef wellington for my entree and it was divine.  It's great to see such a classy and hip restaurant settled into Ohio City.  The food, space, and service are all great."}
{"text":"We couldn't get in to Lola's so we came here and were thrilled that we did.    Food/menu - delicious, interesting, beautiful, eclectic - this chef has an inspired sense of food humor.    Service - fabulous--our cute young waiter actually knew a lot about wine and didn't just push the most expensive stuff on the very extensive list.  Atmosphere - casual, hip, friendly, colorful--loved the weird food photos.  A really memorable meal during a quick visit to Cleveland."}
{"text":"Not only was the food good, but this place gets five stars for the experience. My fiance and I did the Tour de Crop. If you are adventurous, I suggest you try it. I am not the type of person who is willing to eat anything, but there was nothing too shocking in the tour. I don't remember all nine courses because as I write this, it's been a while since we were there (it left that much of an impression). It was just overall great food and the head chef himself brought over each course and explained in detail about it. What sticks out most of the salmon ( I don't even like salmon). It was awesome, the giant sea scallop, the PORK BELLY was amazing, the flourless chocolate cake, the chili deviled eggs. JUST AWESOME."}
{"text":"My dinner group consisted of 3 couples. We explore new restaurants once a month. Our dinner at Crop started out great with valet parking for only $7. The building is absolutely beautiful as it is an old bank. We opted to not get an appetizer because they seemed difficult to share. We just enjoyed a signature drink instead! We all thought our meals were excellent. Before we left we asked hostess to take our picture. The manager saw us and asked if we would like a tour. Before we knew it we were in the basement seeing and learning about the vaults. Everything about this place is top notch."}
{"text":"Need more bar tenders! It's s huge bar, and there are 2to make bar drinks, take dinner orders, abs make drinks for wait am staff tables"}
{"text":"My go to when I come to Cleveland!!! The food is elegant and the architecture is such a treat!"}
{"text":"Had lunch today--really fantastic!  I've been a few times and they are never daunted by my dairy-intolerance. Special care without compromise must be their motto. Motel mushrooms, when in season, the salmon BLT, and really just anything on the menu!"}
{"text":"What can I say about a restaurant that combines a friendly \"everyone knows your name\" atmosphere with locally-sourced, sustainable ingredients combined lovingly into culinary creations that are simultaneously adventuresome and comforting.  Everything about this place screams passion.  From the hosts to the bar staff to the servers to the kitchen staff, everyone is focused on delivering that \"best-ever\" experience to each patron that walks through the door.  Do yourself a favor, arrive a bit early, and get a good start on the night at the bar.  Up on the wall are liquors from all over the world, but what impresses most is the commitment to local, which features various intoxicants brewed or distilled right here in the Buckeye State.  The wonderful, creative tenders of the bar will prepare before your very eyes a fresh squeezed, shaken, muddled, or stirred concoction that will make you seriously consider just \"drinking your dinner.\"  ...but if you did, you'd miss out on all of the wonders yet to come!  Appetizers are exactly that... appetizing.  They are the warm-ups that in many other restaurants could stand in as the main course.  Don't miss the famous Cherry Bombs or the Grilled Flatbread either of which provides a kick-start to the taste buds that will leave you excited for the entrees to come.  The soups and salads are no slouch either, so if you're making a night of it, try the Truffled Potato Soup (if available) and revel in the housemade 1000 Island dressing that accompanies the Soft Wedge salad.  The mains offer exciting adventures into flavor combinations that despite Cleveland's vibrant food scene still manage to strike me as unique.  The preparation of the dishes is top-notch and has never left me disappointed.  Personal favorites include the Seared Ahi Tuna and the Braised Short Ribs.  The tuna is always seared to perfection leaving the taste of only the freshest fish on the tongue.  The accompanying edamame and wesabi soy gastrique provide punches of flavor that complement well. The Short Ribs are tasty fall-off-the-bone goodness which when paired with the fondue mac elicit both savory and creamy tones that dance on the tongue.  Do not by any means think this journey is complete when the plates for your mains depart.  The deserts can lead in many directions from a quiet winding down of the meal to an exciting pick-me-up-even-higher preparing the diner for hijinks yet to come.  Personal favorites include the Pretzel Un-Logic, combining salty-pretzely deliciousness  with the sweetness of chocolate, and the Salted Caramel Affogato which turns ice cream into a delicious coffee float.  No matter what course you chart through the culinary landscape lovingly painted by the the crew at crop, it's bound to be an exciting trip.  Best part?  You don't even have to pack a bag!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for a birthday dinner. Aside from the noise level of the restaurant (which we had braced ourselves for after reading some other reviews), the experience was wonderful! My boyfriend said it goes down as one of his favorite places. Beautiful restaurant, the food was amazing (the salmon was melt in your mouth good), and overall decent service (it was busy so there was a bit of a lag in getting refills, etc), it was a win. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"This is a lovely restaurant in a renovated bank, but it's very very very hit & miss with the drinks and just ok with the food offerings.  Having been there several times with friends & coworkers, I was a tad disappointed in our repeat visits.  I appreciate the change-up of the drink menu to keep things seasonal, fun & fresh but ALL of us ended up moving onto bottled items -- a whiskey sour was returned & wine ordered in its stead. When returned the server tried to insist, well it's our own house made sour mix.  No dear god, the drink was pure lemon juice - all who tasted it were cured of scurvy.  I attempted a honeydew fizz with blackberry...quickly realizing upon tasting that blackberry essence just must mean a blackberry dropped in the glass, so bland & flat.  And our third's twist on a PIMM's turned out to be mostly ginger beer.  So disappointing.   The food is tasty - the cheese board & truffle honey to die for, though nothing is truly spectacular.  Everything is uniformly a tad too salty.  I ordered my favorite - scallops - hoping my first attempt was just a cook's off day.  My 2nd attempt at the scallops failed - so much salt!  I know folks are a real fan of the cocktails - we were too on our first visit.  Muddle Vine - yum!  White Smoke - delicious!  Every visit since then has been a bold disappointment - I think one has to be careful of the mixologist behind the bar, or so I've been told.  Drinks are definitely not uniformly mixed well."}
{"text":"I got a burrito bowl that was filled with lots of fresh ingredients and chicken. It was a good lunch portion and something different than normal lunch joints."}
{"text":"Went here for a friend's bachelor party. Had a beet salad, chicken breast, 2 small corn tamales, and a s'more dessert. Total cost....way too much! Food was okay but nothing amazing, certainly not worth the cost. If you are going to not give a big variety of food for your customer's dollar, then the food had better be amazing...and it wasn't.  Others next to me got the lamb and commented that it was pretty good, so sticking with my \"try every place at least twice\" philosophy, when I ever go back..I'll have to try that dish.  Why 3 stars and not 2? Simply because the building is gorgeous and unique! It's in an old bank and the huge decorated interior (the ceiling!)certainly makes for a unique visual dining experience."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Always a great experience when we go- Can't go wrong with any dish you choose here!  Come to this place with an open mind- the combination of flavors and textures that are used in the menu items is pretty awesome.  If possible ask for a tour of the restaurant or schedule an experience at the Chef's table."}
{"text":"I have to agree with most of the other reviews. The space is breathtaking. It is open and gorgeous while still remaining comfortable and not make you feeling like you're floating in space.It is also probably 50 degrees in there. I'm a big advocate of bringing a jacket out to eat because it's not you house or thermostat to adjust. That being said, it is ridiculously cold.    Now onto the experience: We were SO hungry when we arrived. We immediately ordered the balsamic popcorn and calamari. Of our group of four, all of us loved the calamari. Two enjoyed the balsamic popcorn. I was one who did not especially like it. In my opinion, the sun dried tomatoes overwhelmed any other flavors or consistencies and the balsamic and green pepper? were underwhelming flavor wise.  Entrees: Two of us ordered the short ribs which tasted like a tart mexican dish. My mom enjoyed the scallops. I must say, the Chicken and Waffles was AMAZING. I would go back and get that entree. I would more than likely not try anything else off the menu.    Overall, I was underwhelmed with the whole experience. Maybe my expectations were too high."}
{"text":"AH-FREAKING-MAZING!   I am absolutely obsessed with this place. Whenever my other half and I want to get away from work for a quick lunch, we always go to Crop. It's a little out of the way for him (he comes from Rocky River) but he doesn't mind making the drive for this amazing place.   Their service is always quick and on point, we've never had to wait long to get seated and never waited longer than a minute or two to get greeted by our server. The decor inside to amazing, and the food is even better. I've never had one dish that I didn't love here.  I highly recommend this place for lunch, and I've heard their dinner and happy hour are a most as well."}
{"text":"See the blog for long review:  After a classy yet (typically) boring graduation and myriad proud feelings for my sister we arrived approximately 15 minutes early for our reservation and parked at the affordably $5 valet (you certainly don't get that in the big city.)  Entering the restaurant I was somewhat surprised at how busy the place was at 6:15, but our hostess was quite gracious and quickly showed us to our place at the chef's \"table\" - a bar peering directly into the intimate workings of the kitchen.  With reservations made a month in advance I must admit that despite looking forward to our meal at Crop I had been a tad reluctant given my recent return from a culinary masterpiece of a visit to San Francisco and upcoming trip to New York City - I wondered if I'd simply walk away from Crop with that same \"blah\" feeling I've had at most eateries in the mid-west.  From the moment we were seated, however, my fears were abated.  Watching the young man in front of us flash extremely professional knife skills and an award-worthy personality we were quite amused as we received the first of two amuses bouche directly from his hand - a Chile Deviled Egg with Crisp Pork, Beet, and Balsamic.  While I am the only die-hard egg fan of our group, the amuse was a smash with everyone and particularly interesting to myself in the creaminess of the piped yolk puree's sharp contrast with the spicy and crispy prosciutto.  Complimenting the soft yet textural egg was a light earthiness from the beat and a strong spice from the (if I'm not mistaken) fig based balsamic - things were off to an excellent start.  Before I could even finish my first (of about 10) cornbread we were brought another gift from the chef, himself.  Approximately 1/3 the size of the appetizer portion (a steal at $7) we were each presented with a cup of the house made lobster latte - essentially Crop's take on Lobster bisque but instead of butter heavy made with a seafood stock and crème fraiche whipped to a froth.  Absolutely packed with whole chunks of lobster claw and much less \"heavy\" than a traditional bisque I found this to be a very interesting take on a classic dish - unexpected, unique, and delicious.  Appetizer next was a must - something rare in Ohio and something I order whenever I see it on the menu - foie gras.  Entitled simply Seared Hudson Valley Foie Gras with Toasted Challah and Gingered Apricots I will say flat out that the portion and quality was the best \"bang for your buck\" foie I've tasted outside of San Francisco's One Market.  The soft and ample portion of perfectly prepared liver was contrasted beautifully by the toasted challah which I had the opportunity to witness the chef carve out of a large loaf in a single motion.  Per usual, the addition of an acidic citrus worked wonders for enhancing the flavor while the ginger added a very intriguing taste I've not experienced before.  To all the foie lovers out there - it was better than Gary Danko's or The Dining Room at the Ritz, two much hyped preparations.  The final main, ordered by both myself and my mother, was the Park Farms Chicken Fried Chicken with String Beans, Savory Ohio Maple Waffles.  Super thinly pounded breast coated with panko and cornmeal on both sides, quickly flash fried in the deep fryer and finished in the oven the chicken's taste and texture were wonderful and second to only Boulevard and Momofuku Ssam in quality.  Textural and tasty the chicken's savory components were well tempered by the soft and sweet waffle with ample maple syrup and perfectly crisp yet well done string beans.  A fine dining take on \"comfort food\" that actually works - unlike so many other's vain attempts at mac n' cheese, meatloaf, and pot pies.  The final dessert, Crop's signature \"Crop Circles\" with Hot Coffee Sorbet, Mocha Meringue, Espresso Blondie, Vanilla cream, Espresso Syrup was ordered by my sister and wowed on every level.  With a sorbet that topped Jeni's Black Coffee Icecream, Meringue that tasted better than Starbuck's Mocha, and a Blondie with heavy hints of coffee flavor the whole dish was like a deconstructed/reconstructed tiramisu and appealed as much to the palate as the eyes -  a definite must-order for anyone who likes coffee.  Finishing the meal and paying the bill (less than $60 per person with drinks, tax, tip) I must admit I was absolutely stuffed - but not to the point of discomfort - but lets just say I'm glad there wasn't a course of mignardises or candies.  Brilliant food in a lively setting, a chef who is as willing to support the local markets as he is to take risks, and a friendly amicable staff - plus prices that make \"fine dining\" accessible.  While others will prattle about Lola and Symon, I've been to enough casual and fine dining establishments to definitively say that with Crop in town I'd never give Lola a second thought or chance - better food, better prices, better service, and no pretense whatsoever."}
{"text":"It's that time of year when we visit Crop for our annual Skylight Financial party.  This year, the food was noticeably better than last.  Although the corned beef sandwiches were served on tough bread, the rest of the food was really good.  The salmon sandwiches were tasty and the bread was a bit better than the corned beef sandwich bread.  The little fish n chips trays that the kitchen cranked out were awesome!  The fish was fresh and tasty, the touch of tartar sauce gave it a little kick, and the side of house made potato chips were perfect!  The spicy popcorn was delicious too!  I loved the appetizers and wine.  But then again, everything tastes better when it's free, right?  I still haven't had a normal dinner at Crop, but it's on my bucket list."}
{"text":"I love Cleveland and am always excited to try a new place when visiting for work or to see friends.  I will be stuck in a hotel for the rest of the week -- so I had high expectations for Crop since it will likely be the only break I get from hotel food all week.  It did not disappoint.  The food was fantastic, great service and a beautiful restaurant."}
{"text":"To be honest, I have had better food in my day.  Going here I expected quite a bit but I was actually pretty disappointed.  The atmosphere is appealing and the location is nice, so that was a plus - but still, I felt as if something was missing.  While I can't say that I didn't finish my meal - it has good flavor - it just wasn't all it was cracked up to be.  The chicken was just average and the presentation wasn't there.  Needless to say, I will probably have to go back again with all the positive reviews it has gotten, but my first experience was not up to par."}
{"text":"We went for my daughters birthday and everything we had from the cocktails to the dessert was delicious!  The calamari appetizer was to die for!  The bread was plentiful and fresh, with soft butter to spread easily!  I had the lobster stuffed agnolotti which is basically ravioli and it was soooo yummy!  Perfect portion sizes too!  Others with me had the salmon and the filet which they loved as well.  No one had anything left on their plates!  Worth the money for sure!!!!!  Definitely will be going back!"}
{"text":"Went here for their famous Sunday supper this past Sunday. Grabbed some co-workers and made my way down to w. 6th.  What a deal. $25 for an entree, salad, 2 sides, and dessert? That's impressive in itself.   What's cool about Crop is that their Sunday menus change on a weekly basis. The chef uses his \"leftover\"- well, I mean, they're still fresh- ingredients and makes a whole new menu every Sunday. I kind of wish it was posted earlier? (I think it finally came up somewhere around 5pm).  My friend tried the Applewood Punch- \"Goslings Rum-Domaine de Canton+cider+a warm apple on top. He took one sip of it and claimed it was glorious. Coming from a fellow pharmacist (c'mon, we mix things for a living), I took his word for it.  We ordered the balsamic popcorn as an appetizer. Man, how surprisingly good was that! I was like, \"really? Popcorn? C'mon.\" but it was actually quite good. The spinach leaf salad came out with plenty of vegetables and a light dressing- for five people, it was a huge bowl. For entrees, four of us ordered the salmon with lobster cream- one of us got the corn ravioli (with butternut cream and apples)- his looked amazing. The salmon itself was okay- I loved the sauce with it though. The lobster in the salmon dish though, was a tad overcooked- I mean, for such a small portion of lobster without its shell, it's hard to not overcook that. We also got a side of roots and a side of some kind of vegetable as well. I thought the salmon was a good size..but my other counterparts who got the salmon were all guys, so they were still hungry. I thought it was a good portion though. :)  The dessert was amazing. It was this chocolate-banana-pudding cake, with salted caramel. OMG. SO SO SO SO good. It was incredibly rich though- but oh man, that's some good dessert.  I think all in all, I still like Crop's normal menu versus the random Sunday supper menus, but still, a great restaurant. A CLE fave."}
{"text":"My friends and I went there for a birthday celebration. It is a giant restaurant that looks like a union station. The high ceiling makes it look super spacious but the construction material and inside decoration plus the big space makes it a pretty loud place. it was hard to carry on conversations with people across the table without yelling at each other.  The food was pretty good. I would highly recommend the balsamic popcorn and the ribeye. I tried two appetizers, foie gras and cherry bombs. I personally think they are both ok. The foie gras tasted a little on the heavy side, but with the cookie together, it was not too bad. The cherry bombs looked pretty interesting and tasted kinda like mexican food, but nothing too special about it - it just tasted pretty good and smooth. For entree, I had ribeye. It was cooked correctly and the steak quality was pretty good. The sweet potato on the side complemented the dish well. The short rib that I tasted was pretty well done as well - it was very tendered and could be split easily with your fork. I personally prefer ribeye a little more though.  For drinks, if you prefer drinks on the sweeter side, my darling clementine can be a good choice. the margarita was pretty strong."}
{"text":"So I really like this place, but I won't be back.  Now that does not reflect on the food quality, service or ambiance, so let me explain.  It's a BEAUTIFUL building.  STUNNING. Worth going just to check it out.  The prices are very reasonable.   (10-14 for lunch) I thought it was a good sign that there was no salt or pepper on the table, as that's generally a sign that the chef is so good his/her food doesn't need seasoning. The menu was just not to my liking.  If you like pork or prociutto, you are going to be in HEAVEN.  I just don't like it.  It's a little too Michael Symon for my taste, so if you like his restaurants you'll probably love this one.  We went on Ash Wednesday and there weren't really any vegetarian options on the menu, so we both ordered the special of the day which was a Striped Bass with a potato pancake.  It was a touch fishy (I wished I had pepper).  The real problem was there was prociutto in the potato pancake, I don't know if that was by design or accidental, but it was definitely there.  I did not ask our server if it had meat, so that was my mistake, but a lent special, usually does not contain meat.  Our server was great, excellent service: very low key, she was a great waitress: Kathleen. So again, bread, ambiance, and service would be 5 star, but the menu is just not to my taste."}
{"text":"Everyone seems to love this place, but I didn't have the best experience there.  Overpriced, overrated, overthought food! I guess I'm not a fan of food that's overly complicated. But the flourless chocolate torte with peanut butter ice cream dessert was fabulous."}
{"text":"OK. So I have loved Crop since day 1. Actually even BEFORE day 1 since I had met Steve and Jackie before they opened the place. When it first opened, they had a great location in the Warehouse District and always provided great, fresh food. Always reminded me of CA where I grew up. The farm to table influence even hit the cocktails! Such tasty concoctions for each season!  I'm pleased to say that absolutely nothing has changed in the manner of service, food or drink. But now they have moved into an absolutely GORGEOUS old bank branch building - the old Union Bank in OH City. I've seen reviews saying it's too \"grand\" or \"empty\". Ridiculous! Why can't a restaurant in Cleveland exist in a beautiful space? In fact, Cleveland could take a hint and start to clean itself up! Why not compete with the big boys?  My favorite place to eat is the bar since the bartenders are incredibly friendly and super knowledgeable about what they're serving. (As an aside, Crop even tries to stock OH created liquors. Impressive!)   I'd love to see how they decorate for the holidays. The space is truly amazing. I can't say I've ever eaten in a restaurant where I want to just gaze at the ceiling and the beautiful large windows flanked by marble pillars. Beautiful. You're missing out if you haven't been."}
{"text":"After reading the other reviews for Crop Bistro on this site, I knew I wanted to go there.  My husband and I had dinner there last night and I already want to go back.  We decided that since we had never been, the best way to try it was to sit at the chef's table.  We sat at the counter facing into the kitchen, and were there eating for almost 2 hours.  Of course, considering that we tasted about 10 different dishes, that much time is to be expected.  When we arrived, we each ordered a cocktail.  I had the PB&B, the peach-basil something with champagne.  It was tasty and fresh, but not too sweet.  DH had some kind of iced tea tasting drink that I didn't much care for but he liked it.  Then the food.  Steve came over to introduce himself and then presented us with our first course: deviled eggs with prosciutto.  Then we had grilled watermelon with ahi tuna and soy-ginger sauce.  Consecutively after that was figs with cheese and honey, salmon and basmati rice, sea scallops with polenta, a shaved asparagus and endive salad, then a palate-cleansing mango-ginger popsicle.  I was at the point of being stuffed, but then Steve told us that we hadn't had the main course yet (!!!).  He served us pork belly with deep fried pickles!  I regret not being able to eat much of it, I was so full.  (Then sadly, we forgot to bring home the little box that he put our leftovers into.)  After the pork was lamb over bean and olive salad, with rosemary frites on top.  FINALLY after all that, he brought us homemade orange creamsicle floats, which sounds a little strange, but after all that food I was glad for something light.  Oh, also somewhere in there one of the chefs snuck us a little bowl of the balsamic popcorn, which I had been especially eager to try.  The server also brought us a little dish of herb and cheese muffins with honey butter, but with the advice that we probably didn't want to eat too many of them so we could concentrate on the food being served from the kitchen.  So in a word: wow!  Everything we tried, we liked.  There were even a couple of ingredients that I wasn't crazy about (olives) but I liked the way they were prepared.  So we would definitely go back, although with the price, it won't be as soon as I like."}
{"text":"Went to Crop Bistro on a weeknight to celebrate our anniversary.  We got there at 8:30 and ended up being the last table in the restaurant.  The pacing of the meal was perfect, which is a big deal to me.  As we ordered drinks, apps, salads, and entrees all at the once, the timing was spot on, excellent service.  The room is striking when you walk in because of how large and ornate it is, it's a great atmosphere for an elegant (but not snooty) dinner.   I had the Mr. Figgy cocktail which features a bruleed piece of bacon, the garnish was almost better than the drink.    The cheese plate had wonderful accompaniments, including a raspberry jam, which had the most intense raspberry flavor I've ever tasted, perhaps the most intense flavor of any jam I've tried.  My wife got the faroe salmon and I think we both agreed that was our favorite dish of the night, so many interesting flavors and combinations.  I had the short rib noodle bowl, the veggies were perfect and the noodles were nice and salty and delicious.  My only complaint (of perhaps the entire night) was the short ribs were a tad dry, but delicious nonetheless."}
{"text":"Took a client out to eat at Crop Bistro and had a great meal.  Great atmosphere with back drop of the high, ornate ceilings.  The wine selection was good.  We shared a cheese platter with 3 chef's choice cheese, heirloom tomato salad and lamb with a mid-price bottle of chianti.  Fun meal and the waiter did a great job as well."}
{"text":"Excellent food, ambiance, price, and service! Rarely does a restaurant have all four items perfectly synced. But Crop has. Will go back again soon."}
{"text":"Crop has always been super solid for me.  I usually go for a late night hang with drinks/apps or for lunch.  The space is really sharp and arguably the nicest and most unique in CLE.  Some favorites have always been the cherry bombs (note: not a drink!) the balsamic/truffle popcorn.  Really good portions and value for lunch as well."}
{"text":"We just stopped in here for a little snack while walking around this area; we weren't really starving or anything so just tried a few items off the menu.    Balsamic popcorn is pretty delish.  I know, I know. What a ripoff for popcorn, but this particular popcorn inspired me to DIY gourmet popcorn during movie nights, so I say give it a try.  Plus it's plenty big and there's enough for everyone to enjoy their fair share.  We also ordered the cherry bombs -- you get two, and they are just a unique little dish that's pretty delectable.  The sauce they come with is also pretty amazing!   Service is decent -- I didn't really care for my server, as she seemed a little snooty, but it didn't really affect my overall experience.  Ambiance is pretty neat since the building that houses the restaurant is historic, but the ceilings are extremely high in there, and it causes everything to echo... so it's noisy (i.e. the restaurant to bring your auntie that always re-tells the same stories to)  I don't have any desire to come back to this place which is why I'm only giving it 3-stars.  Four stars and above are spots that I'd like to return to."}
{"text":"My coworker and I were walking around trying to find a great restaurant to try in Cleveland, and we decided to go to Crop Bistro.  We walked in and immediately liked the decor of different veggie artwork all over the retaurant.  The menu was simple that changes with the season.  According to their motto, they try to use local produces, which is awesome in my book.  I ordered the pan-seared hiramasa with sweet pea mashed and shiitake mushrooms.  The sweet pea mashed was my favorite; it was soo tasty and fresh.  It complimented the fish really well.  The portions are also larger than I thought they would be.  Everyone also receives some homemade corn bread, which was delicious.  The best part of the cornbread was the home made black pepper and honey butter.  It was excellent!  I definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone wanting to try a restaurant that utilizes fresh produces from local vendors!  Yummy!"}
{"text":"Our first visit today for a family event. I wanted to LOVE it. Several family members raved about this restaurant.   Maybe it was the volume of business today, but the service was terrible, and the food on the buffet was cold, and very slow to be refilled. The selection was incredible, and would have been excellent if it was served hot. We cleared our own plates, and scouted the restaurant for salt and pepper.  We may give it another shot in a smaller group, but...there are a lot of other choices."}
{"text":"Stellar! I was at Crop today for the first time...and it won't be the last. 3 friends and I went for the brunch buffet, which is pricey, yes, but worth the splurge. Shrimp, crab legs, lobster salad, charcuterie, eggs benedict, etc. The bacon and sausage was better than any I've had. Service was impeccable, and the restaurant itself is dazzling to look at. You really should go to this place!"}
{"text":"I've been to Crop several times for lunch and dinner since it opened a year or so ago.  This place has never failed to be wonderful.  It is a foodie paradise.  Today I went with my best foodie buddy for lunch.   Now I sit, stuffed to the gills and happy.    THE FOOD:  Fresh, local, seasonal and healthy.    There is a continuum of duck  On one end, there is greazzy, mushy undercooked slime, on the other stringy, tough, oily twine.  There is a tiny and beautiful area of canard perfection, where the duck is tender and juicy, yet still firm.  Crop owns that tiny slice of perfection.  Ditto for the lamb.  Today we could not decide what we wanted so we each started with a bowl of tomato, chipotle and bleu cheese soup until we could decide.  If we could have gotten away with licking our bowls in public, we would have.  The soup tasted of fresh tomatoes and smoky chilis, not salt.   We ordered two lunches and split them-- the Pig Mac and the beef Cropicana bowl.  The Pig Mac is a porky bit of heaven comprised of pork loin, pulled pork and bacon with special sauce and fresh pickles all on a sesame seed bun.  Yes, Lisa, the pig is a magic animal.   It was accompanied by a creamy, sweet encini de pepe waldorf salad.  The Cropicana bowl is a Domme version of what Chipotle wishes it could be-- bbq beef, black beans, cilantro sour cream, rice, cheese lettuce and love.  Thank God we've been friends for years, so we could forgive and even appreciate the utter gluttony that ensued.  I've been there when I was on my best manners.  I had the corn chowder and a chicken/apple/camembert sammich.  It took the utmost restraint not to make obscene little moan-y noises whilst eating.  My companion had the Willie Bird-- the coolest take on a turkey sammich you will ever eat.  I didn't know him well enough to eat off his plate.  Dang.  THE ATMOSPHERE:  It is a nice, wide open area with comfy velvet booths.  The kitchen is open.  Decorations are hip takes on the notion of crops-- macro photos of fruit, wheat sheaved chandeliers...  THE SERVICE;  Very good, friendly, helpful but not intrusive.  The waiters are all foodies.  Take their advice.    I need a nap, now."}
{"text":"I've found myself here multiple times recently and each has been fantastic!  Went to an event they held to show off their event spaces. If anyone is looking for a place to have a company party or rehearsal dinner, this is your place!! Cool vault or modern rooftop bar?! They've got you covered!   I came with a group of 10 ladies for a baby shower and everything was perfect. The service could not have been better and everyone was blown away by the food. Deviled eggs and popcorn forever!   Highly recommend for any occasion. Happy hour, brunch, dinner, fancy event? Crop would be good for all of them!"}
{"text":"Well , i'm unimpressed with this restaurant, it did not meet my expectations at all , based on other reviews and the pictures i was expecting a very good experience at this place but meh , it was disappointing!  The food was ok but not anything special! We ordered steak , the quality was average or below !  our Drinks were pretty good but not the food ! I mean if you want to spend 100$ there are much better and smarter ways for it than losing your money in this place .  To be honest this is a nice place but  looks better in pictures than what you see in person, it's too spacious and a bit cold !  Bottom line:this restaurant is overrated,it's not what i expect from a high end place, I'm not going back"}
{"text":"Spectacularly phenomenal. Some of the best food I've ever eaten ever in the entire world. EVERYTHING is FAN-F-ING FANTASTIC. The owner/chef/mastermind guy comes out gets down with the people and the whole thing is a lovely experience. The butter for the bread is wonderfully, subtly flavored. The complimentary amuse bouche is lovely. The fois gras is divine. My seafood pasta was an incredibly amazingly delicious explosion of flavors and saffron, my mother-in-law's Middle-Eastern inspired lamb chops and couscous was likewise an amazingly delicious explosion of flavors.   For dessert we shared the salted caramel affogato with amaretto, which was awesome except they forgot to give us the amaretto inside the dessert and gave it to us after, so we added a little bit and drank the rest and they comped the ammaretto for us. I almost asked for it before digging in but since everything was so completely spectacular I figured I was the one who made the mistake!  This place is a MUST TRY OFTEN. They even have a crazy good deal on Sundays for $25 which I haven't tried but my mom and her boyfriend went and they of course loved it.   I overheard a woman sitting next to us say that her son eats there 3 times per week. If I lived within stumbling distance, I'd be there too!  At least every Sunday for sure. OMFG what an insane deal for some of the best food in the world."}
{"text":"Maybe this place used to be something special.   We had the \"tour de crop\", just four courses.  The chef's choice!    We got wedding food (and not like those dope jewish weddings, but like a waspy country club wedding).   The \"tour de crop\" was a deviled egg (with canned crab meat on top), a seared scallop (the only item worth a star), a beet salad (you know the one, with goat cheese and pistachios - you can get a better version at Luca), and then a braised short rib on mashed potatoes.  A BRAISED SHORT RIB ON MASHED POTATOES.   WEDDING FOOD."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere were excellent. The interior of the building was absolutely gorgeous. However, portions were extremely small given the price you pay for them; excellent, just small. Also, our waitress didn't exemplify the word hustle, as my glass was not refilled the entire night.  If you like the atmosphere of Ohio City you will love this place. Great food, just no bang for your buck"}
{"text":"This really could have been bad luck for our three dinner visits based on other reviews:  I really want to like Crop Bistro. The restaurant itself is beautiful and the service has been great for the three times we've tried dinner here.  Our problem was with the quality of the food. The grits on the shrimp had a very rubbery taste to them and took away from the rest of the flavor. The potatoes were cold when our plates arrived on the second visit and again took away from what else was happening on the plate. I also had bad luck with the lamb being overcooked. There were some great flavors happening in the dishes, but we found ourselves enjoying it less because of something that was off in the rest of the dish.   Maybe we'll try this place again in the future, but there are a lot of other offerings in the area to try first before heading back."}
{"text":"Oddly not busy for a Friday night. From 6-8p there were only a handful of tables full. As I said in a prior review the place is simply gorgeous. The chairs are also very comfortable.   Our server was very attentive and friendly and did not rush us. We started with just some wine and were able to just sit and wind down with that before being asked to order. The meal then was nicely paced with two appetizers following the wine.   The three cheese board did also come with some pickled veg, two spreads, bread, crackers and some spiced almonds. The deviled eggs were very good as well. There was crisp prosciutto in each one and the yolks were creamy and flavorful from the chile aioli.    I ordered the Faroe Island Salmon ($30) for my main. It was very good and well prepared. It was served on top of a basmati fried rice. The somewhat Asian flavor of the sauce and the base were an excellent addition to the large portion of salmon. I would definitely order this again."}
{"text":"Service was sub par, really ... It was so disappointing ... when we got our food it was good , but from the bar service to the table service... very disappointed... step it up!!"}
{"text":"Took my sister here last night for her birthday, had the six course tasting menu.   Crop is located in an old bank building, so the setting is pretty spectacular.   Since we sat at the counter facing the kitchen, each course was served and described by the chef, Steve Schimoler.   Everything was great, but for me the star was Hudson Valley fois gras with a pomegranate sauce. Other courses included seared tuna, a huge scallop, a salad of roasted red and yellow beets, a braised short rib and four desserts.   Great food, friendly service, terrific ambiance. Great place for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Wait for table with reservation = 25 minutes Wait for server = 1 minute (Good) Wait for 1st Course = 15 minutes (Fair) Wait for main course = 1 hr 5 minutes (Horrible)  Service was not the best (Still tipped 35%) The food was EXCELLENT  The noise was so loud.....very bad acoustics.   Old Bank?  40 foot ceilings.....however it was a beautiful place.   1st and last time....I would still recommend trying it if you have plenty of time.....VERY, VERY good food."}
{"text":"breathtaking interior.  tender and moist veal chop. other offerings tasted great as well.  Some were off (beet salad), but still a great establishment overall."}
{"text":"Went there Thursday evening for the 5-7pm happy hour thing.  Fantastic deals on three excellent, craft brewed beers (no, sorry, no Miler Light, Budweiser, etc -- I said *excellent* beers) and $5 appetizers.  (This review is limited to one Thursday evening experience.)  We tried the calamari (excellent-- cooked perfectly and very tasty), cherry bomb (deep fried and our least favorite), two salads (both creative and excellent), balsamic popcorn (interesting and also very creative), and flatbread (very good as well).    We ate in the bar which was about 1/3 full just after 5pm when we arrived and was overflowing when we left at about 6:30 or so.  We looked at the dinner menu and asked ourselves \"why?\"  I think if I rated a dinner/dining room experience my rating would be lower.  So, this rating is limited to the \"Thursday evening deal\":  * Price/value:  5  * Service:  5    * Environment, inside:  4-5  * Environment,, outside:  2 (It's in downtown Cleveland, right?)  * Food creativity and quality:  5  Would we go back?  You BET!  ... On a Thursday."}
{"text":"I heard & read good things about Crop Bistro so I decided to give it a try. I went on a busy Saturday night, while the restaurant was full. The restaurant itself had beautiful decor, and a vibrant atmosphere. Seating was swift and we got our menus and ordered drinks very right away. We receive a basket of warm baguette and whipped butter, which was slightly sweet. I ordered the scallop appetizer, Peking Duck breast (medium rare) , and ribeye steak (medium well). The scallops arrived with two on a plate surrounded by vegetables. I was disappointed in the lack of scallops on the plate, and they were slightly over salted otherwise the dish was okay. We waited about 20 minutes for the entrées. At this point i was slightly annoyed by the birthday party next to us which was being way too loud and we couldn't hear or understand what the waiter was saying.The duck I ordered was a little more than medium rare, it was raw and Stone cold. I had to eat around the cold raw parts . The risotto that came with the duck was unspectacular, however the duck confit veg roll was delicious but slightly dry. The cranberry sauce that came with the duck wasn't good, but the steak in my dates dish was cooked nicely but was very under seasoned and she couldn't finish it. we skipped dessert and payed around $100 for the 3 dishes with tips.In conclusion I was underwhelmed by the experience, and the food was not worth the price, I recommend Le petite Triangle which isn't far from Crop for better food at half the price. Lola had much better food for the same price."}
{"text":"Knowledgable and attentive service at the bar and table without a trace of obsequious. These people know their stuff and are happy to give you their opinion.  Environment is amazing. Glorious Roaring Twenties style 'luxe' setting in an old bank (not, as some have said, IN the vault)... just in the main banking business area complete with marble pillars, gorgeous carved plaster ceiling, and old walnut details.   Broad range of dishes. I enjoyed a Black Bulleit (a riff on a Manhattan with rye whiskey and sweet-but-not-too-sweet 'drunk cherries') at the bar before dinner. From there I followed the bartender's advice (\"I'm feeling the pork today\") and enjoyed the fried pork chop with a chorizo gravy atop cheese grits and the most favorful swiss chard I've had in years. Delicious. Every element was perfectly balanced with the rest, nicely seasoned, and perfectly prepared. Portions are generous but not indecent.   I topped this off with an elegant apple filled pastry with some kind of whipped almond (?) creme on the side that deserves to be in a Dessert Hall of Fame. (and I'm not even a dessert girl)   The wine list is estimable... eclectic and knowledgeable with an appropriate balance of trans-continental to local (California and Oregon) wines. Would love to see an Australian (Marlborough county) Sauvignon Blanc, and an Italian Malbec, but in general I was impressed with the breadth of the selections."}
{"text":"Great service! Food was excellent! The restaurant itself is also architectural very unique! Refined and very welcoming!  We will come back!"}
{"text":"Beautiful environment, fantastic service, and delicious food! This fine dining establishment in the old bank hall is on par with anywhere I've been in Chicago, New York, or LA. I came here with my partner after a pretty awful experience down the street at the Market Avenue Wine Bar, and I'm so glad I did!"}
{"text":"I had been looking to my first dining experience in this old bank building. It's beautiful. But the acoustics are bad. If you're hard of hearing you'll have a difficult time. Four stars for slow service at the beginning, and we couldn't hear the waitress.   We were a party of 14. That number of people should require two servers. Apparently there was a staff shortage, because our waitress seemed to be working a lot of tables. A male waiter saved the day. He kept the water glasses full, served the dishes and cleared the table appropriately. He was very friendly answering questions. But staffing is a manager's concern. We were there one hour too long.   Despite a slow start, the food was delicious!  The popular short ribs were not a menu item, but the nightly special. Everyone seemed pleased. The tomato-basil soup was tasty. The beet salad was hardy. The tempura oyster app was good, tho I was expecting the rice batter, and I only tasted an oyster once or twice. The lobster agnolotti needed more lobster, but was good, I was told. The mushroom risotto was the best. So we liked the food.   Kind of the manager to give us complimentary desserts due to the long wait time. Save room for all the cakes. They looked divine. I must say that the creme brûlée was the best I've ever had. Nice flavor."}
{"text":"This past weekend just solidified the 5 star rating that's held more or less constant since my first review.  Just had my wedding reception in the Crop vault and the whole process was so easy. The event coordinator (David) was on top of everything and made sure that the reception was flawless from cocktail hour (good selection for open bar and balsamic popcorn and cornbread as appetizers). AND THE FOOD. We decided to go with a fixed mini menu instead of having guests choose ahead of time with the invite and the food was executed 1) flawlessly 2) timely (no long waits in between courses with all the order) and 3) my wedding cake was amazing. Waitstaff was plenty and no one was left wanting. We're still getting compliments on the reception.   The staff was also very thoughtful to us, making extra cornbread, etc for the groom because he mentioned that he was such a fan."}
{"text":"I love it here! It is always my first choice for my birthday. It is in a beautiful building, you always feel special when you are there!   Everything I have ever gotten there is amazing! Especially the salmon!!"}
{"text":"Highly recommended. Obviously this is not every weekend brunch place. Definitely can add more selections to desert but still pretty great. Need more places like this is Cleveland! Seafood selection is better than pier w and pier w is really good. Meat quality needs some improvement. Great servers- very attentive. My small coffee cup was never without coffee throughout brunch."}
{"text":"Baby, I'm Amazed.  I checked out Crop's Thursday Happy Hour and was more than surprised!  My gaggling of girls ordered everything on the menu so we got more than a taste of what they have to offer.  Everything was delicious and, what...only $5 a plate?  I especially liked the Cherry Bomb which was a Phyllo covered tomato stuffed with herbs and chorizo nesting happily on a creamed corn bed.    The drinks were $3 for beer (Victory, Stone) and $5 for drinks and wines.  I think I'd spend that much just to come in and look around.  The venue is spectacular!    I haven't been doing 5 stars lately but, this is well deserved - Great food, service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great food and awesome prices for lunch. Had scallops for $14 and truffle popcorn for $6. Nice sized portions! Def recommend   Soup - real meaty, almost like chili  Popcorn - wow super gourmet - balsamic and truffle sauce with maybe some arugala too  Scallops - real tasty, however there was a LOT of rice and i would have liked to have seen more than 3 pieces of scallops instead"}
{"text":"We went to celebrate my daughter's confirmation on a Saturday afternoon for lunch and it was excellent.  The place is beautiful and it made for a unique and memorable experience. Lunch prices are very reasonable for such high quality food made from excellent ingredients.   Another advantage of lunch is that it is much quieter. The place can get loud when it is crowded for dinner but we had privacy and quiet in the cavernous dining room.   Most impressive was that they had such wide a variety of menu options and they were all made well with the freshest ingredients.   Service was excellent.  My daughter's shrimp and scallops wasn't as hot as she liked-that can happen with a party of seven and I appreciated that our server quickly checked on our food and just as quickly brought her a new, hot entree. Issue resolved."}
{"text":"I have to agree with most of the other reviews. The building is very beautiful and open. The decor is very nice and I really liked that it was a bank before. Keep in mind, since it is very spacious it was freezing the entire time I was there. Dress accordingly. It was my birthday dinner with my bf before we were heading to Cavs game. We were in a great mood and was ready to eat a great meal! Well, this dinner really put a damper on the night. My waiter was not the nicest. He took forever to take the drink & food orders. Didn't feel like answering our questions, he was quick and one worded. We ordered pork belly for the appetizer, we really enjoyed the dish. My bf ordered pheasant, it was good but the sauce was overpowering the pheasant itself. I ordered the ribeye and again I felt as though the sauce too much. It was sour and took away from the ribeye. I wish I could have enjoyed it a little more. The waiter didn't ask us ONCE how our food was. The guy walking around filling our water was more helpful than our waiter! Didn't make any conversation, didn't ask if we had been there before, or what were we celebrating, etc. When I ordered dessert, my bf asked if they could put some candles on it since it was my bday. He didn't say a word. The gal who brought it out wished me a happy bday. When we got our check, the dessert was included in it. Not to complain but MOST restaurants give a complimentary dessert. I didn't mind showing him my ID to prove it was my actual bday. I just thought for such a nice restaurant, it was something they could have comped. Maybe my expectations were too high. We paid and actually tipped very well bc I am not one to punish everyone else working for my waiter's lack of customer service. However,  I don't think I would ever go back or recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"Great spot for a special holiday or other special occasion meal. Pre-meal, Ryan made great cocktails at the bar. If you like Chartreuse, the Bijou shouldn't be missed.  At the table, our waiter, Jimmy D, was friendly and knowledgeable. The calamari appetizer was amongst the most tender we've ever had. The popcorn appetizer - truffle oil, cheese etc. - was fun and tasty as well.  Three at the table ordered the red snapper special. It was served over a scrumptious crab risotto. One ordered the ricotta stuffed gnocchi special. The gnocchi were great but filling.  For dessert, one can't go wrong with the pistachio cheesecake. If the cheesecake wasn't full of enough calories already, it was topped with a delicious buttercream icing."}
{"text":"We came here for a holiday dinner with a party of 6.  It was a Saturday night and the house was packed. My friend had made a reservation on OpenTable but somehow it never went through and she didn't have a confirmation. The hostess was so helpful and managed to pull three tables together at the bar and we were able to order off of the full menu in the bar area.  We started with the cheese plate. So Yum. What a great selection of cheeses! Also, the portions were nice, not too skimpy. Others at the table started with the bomb and they enjoyed that as well.  For dinner we all loved our meals. Each of us was happy with how they turned out and there was enough on the plate to take home leftovers. The new building is so cool. Because its so big and open, the restaurant gets a bit loud, but nothing crazy. The place is very pretty.   The only thing I was a little disappointed with was the dessert selection. They didn't have much to choose from and nothing struck our fancy. No no biggie.   I can't wait to go back and sit at the chef's table for a tasting menu. I think that would be amazing."}
{"text":"I've been here twice for their Sunday brunch in the last month.  It is definitely worth the price tag.  Hot foods included scrambled eggs, bacon & sausage, eggs Benedict, mussels, waffles & french toast (delish), crawfish, grits, mac & cheese, and brisket.  Cold foods included whole snow crab legs, whole smoked salmon, sliced smoked salmon (for bagels and lox), shrimp cocktail. There's an assortment of fresh sliced fruit and fruit salad.  Pasta salad, Caesar salad, cold cuts and cheeses.  The carving station had prime rib and lamb on one visit and prime rib and ham on the other.  Desserts include tarts, lemon bars, mini creme brulee, cake pops, and mini tiramisu.  Your first bloody mary or mimosa is included in the price.  Our servers were always attentive, but not intrusive.  Don't forget to ask for crackers for the crab and they have drawn butter near the carving station.  I recommend this brunch to anyone!"}
{"text":"The food and service here is excellent. Don't hesitate to try it! Everything I had was amazing! Oh and the drinks at the bar are awesome as well."}
