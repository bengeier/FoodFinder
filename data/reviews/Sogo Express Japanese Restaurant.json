{"text":"Absolute worst service. I have never been treated so rudely. Food was cold. Managers girlfriend was even rude. Floor was sticky and food sub par."}
{"text":"I agree with the others.  What the...! Couldn't tell if its Japanese, Chinese or combo. Veggies overcooked, egg rolls/tempura soggy/greasy... Really?"}
{"text":"Food is okay..its filling. The store isn't very clean. And the staff is by far some of the rudest people you'll ever come in contact with. Save yourself and go to TokyoExpress."}
{"text":"Probably the worst Japanese food that I have ever had. Hell the place waters down the Teriyaki...yuck. The tables were sticky, never cleaned the right way. Do Not waste your time here...anything is better."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times before and have never been impressed. The people who work here take their time coming to the counter and are less than enthusiastic taking my order. It's like they know something I don't.
So I go in and finally get my order placed. Nothing complicated just two teriyaki chicken and two Dr. peppers. The employee looks at me and says chicken? And I say yes two teriyaki chicken's and two Dr. peppers. He puts the order in and then gets two drinks. He says did you say Coke? And I correct him yet again no Dr Pepper. So the food finally comes up and I walk up to get it. We start to eat and immediately taste something that feels like sand in the broccoli. It's gritty in my teeth and crunches like glass. So I proceed to just eat the chicken and work my way around the broccoli, placing all the broccoli on my tray. I ate all I could before telling the staff that the food was no good. All I got was an insincere apology and a strange smile. I demanded the owners name and number and the employee (Moses) didn't even know the managers number.
So I called the manager sunny and he basically accused me of trying to rip the store off for $12. Saying that Moses said I ate all the food and now I am not entitled to get my money back. I told him that Moses is a liar and that the food sucked. After a little bit more discussion he says that I could come to the Branchview store and get my money back. It's not worth $12 for me to drive 15 miles out of my way. It's just too bad that the person running the store couldn't handle the complaint on site. In hindsight I believe the hard things in my food were from a dirty grill. But I won't ever know because I will never go back!"}
{"text":"Went there about 30 mins before closing and was told no more orders taken, all the while customers were in there and some had just placed an order. They weren't even nice about it , it was embarrassing. Won't ever go back"}
{"text":"If you can get passed the disgusting condition of the store. Then you can enjoy, mediocre at best food. 

After ordering my food, I went to wash my hands. To find a disgusting restroom with a door that doesn't lock! So I baracaided myself in with the trash can. Tables where dirty. My food order was wrong, which is not that bad. But the hair in my food was the icing on the cake. I will never go there again."}
{"text":"I see that there are several \"locations\" for this \"chain\" I would be willing to bet that they are the same . Ok Ok this place is located in a busy busy area right off the interstate and close to the shrine \" The Race Track\".... enough of the driving in circles stuff..
             I bet within 50 yds there are more than 30 places to eat at this location or more so I guess they think they have a \"corner market\" as well. A good location does not Make a Good place to eat!!! And I have been to many of them!!! This day I had to try the place came with over cooked chicken canned carrots? and old rice that I watched them pour from container to container now I know why I felt sick the next day.
             So here it is with the \"special sauce\" can not figure it out what does thousand Island dressing have to do with Japanese Food? Is that just a add on to American it?Guess so... Barf"}
{"text":"Well.... mediocre at best. Saw the guy dumping a large bag of frozen carrots into the cooker, so I figured the rest of the food came out of the freezer or can also.
I love hibachi steak but I definitely will not try it here again."}
{"text":"I truly don't understand why there are so many negative reviews for this place! I decided to try Sogo despite these comments and was pleasantly surprised to find the food to the quite good! I ordered the hibachi shrimp and fried rice combo. The shrimp were properly cooked, seasoned and free of tails. The rice was lightly seasoned and typically Japanese. Other reviewers seem to be conflating Japanese and (Americanized) Chinese cuisine when complaining about the rice. True, the seasoning was much more finely chopped which created a smooth melange of flavor rather than separate and distinct chunks of onion, shallots, etc... BUT THAT'S HOW JAPANESE RICE IS PRESENTED! The large soda I included was truly large; I believe it was a 32 oz. cup! Beyond the food, the two guys manning the cash register and grill were very pleasant and personable. The ONLY negative thing I have to say (ergo the 4 start rating) is that their men's bathroom is not properly set up for handicap accessibility. I'm paraplegic so this of particular importance to me. The toilet is raised, but it's not an elongated bowl and the seat isn't the horseshoe/open-front design that folks like me need. Still, I would've tried to use it save for the fact that it was so loose on one side that it would've meant risking a trip to the ER just to empty my bladder. So, while I was waiting for my order I dashed over to the Dunkin Donuts next store to use their facilities. Fix that one thing and you'll create a regular repeat customer in me."}
{"text":"Really really ..... really really really really bad. Been sick ever since I ate there for lunch. Should have known from the condition the restaurant was in. Food, hair, dirt all over the tables, seats, floor. Restaurant wasn't my choice so I had to deal with it. Never ever again. Really needs the health dept to check this place out. :,("}
{"text":"The amount of food you get for the price is nice.  The fried rice is a  little under seasoned, but not really terrible.  It does have peas and an onion or two in there. 
     It would be completely unfair if I didn't mention the carrots.  The carrots are incomparably delicious!  Truly the star of this establishment.

Back to the main course...
The chicken was over cooked and so very dried out. The shrimp sauce is outstanding!  And the only thing that can possibly save this dried out meal.     
     I believe the yummy pink \"shrimp\" sauce they serve must have traces of shrimp in it.  Even though they said \"it did not.\"  I am allergic to shellfish and this sauce sparks a terrible rash of hives etc., 
         The service is friendly, fast and the place is clean.  This meal is inexpensive, and the chicken is actual \"chicken,\" but I have to be honest.  Save the carrots, This food is just not good.  
             As I choke down their desert, dry, bland chicken it is with a heavy heart that honestly I cannot give them more than two stars."}
