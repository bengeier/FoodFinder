{"text":"I WILL NOT COME BACK. The food was too salty and no flavor at all. The quality and quantity were way below my expatiation. And I am 100% sure that 1lb is not even close to the half lb. BTW it's CASH ONLY. Where all those good reviews come from?"}
{"text":"It's not our first time trying crawfish but this place is literally the best in town! We went here for a late night snack and they opened after midnight. We also tried the Coconut Chicken hotspot and the soup was super good."}
{"text":"Good place for hang out. It seems like they are new into the business and doesn't have much idea what they are doing . But honestly everyone need time and patience to grow their business . The owners look like recently graduated student and good to startup. Will support u guys for surely but need to create friendly and warm environment first. Best of luck guys"}
{"text":"Love their spicy crawfish! I also ordered duck tongues and cold noodle. Both dishes were tasty. The noodle was spicy and sweet, but very yummy. Will definitely come back for their crawfish!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is a no frills kind of Chinese restaurant where the servers speak Mandarin.  The menu was very simple with three types of crawfish, crab legs, mussels, appetizers, main courses, chicken coconut hot pot, and additional garnishes to add to the hot pots.  We were given a very small platter of pre-appetizers.  It was some kind of salty peanuts, nuts, and jellyfish.  The pieces were so small!  It was like a child's snack.  I liked the green salty peanuts though.  The Signature Cold Noodle was the first to arrive.  I was super impressed with this dish!  Although it was just plain cold noodles with some carrots, raw green onions, and chili peppers, after mixing it all together, it became the most refreshing and tasty cold noodle dish ever!  Despite the pile of chili peppers on top of it, it wasn't spicy at all either.  This was so good!  The Szechuan Style Deep-Fried Pork Belly arrived next.  I don't think I've ever had deep-fried pork belly before.  Its appearance was similar to popcorn chicken.  It wasn't Szechuan spicy either.  It was nicely fried.  The \"Thirteen-Spices Seasoned Crawfish\" was delivered in a square dish with tin foil.  The crawfish were covered with the spices both externally and internally too.  When you peeled apart the shell, the crawfish meat was thoroughly soaked and seasoned with the spices.  It wasn't very spicy either surprisingly.  It was actually more salty than spicy.  The crawfish was quite meaty and pretty good."}
{"text":"Quite pricy for itsportion and really salty. Service wasn't great, either."}
{"text":"You know when your friends will never stop make fun of you for one mistake that you made? Well this is it. It's been almost over 1 year but they will never forget this place as I made the choice to go here. The experience was horrendous that now, whenever I pick out a place to go eat, they will look at me funny and doubtfully. This is just one of those mistake that I will never get to live down. So please save your money, palate, and reputation (or not) by not going to this place."}
{"text":"So overpriced and bland... Will definitely not come again. $20 for few crawfish tails and broccoli? Hell no"}
{"text":"Not what I was expecting... by the way if you're looking for Cajun style crawfish this isn't the place to go. Tried the crawfish with different spices and coconut chicken pot (based on good reviews) but the pot had no coconut flavour at all. Sorry, wouldn't recommend. :("}
{"text":"Service was not that great. Barely got enough napkins or water for the 6 of us. I got the deep fried pork belly app and was not amazed. Just deep fried pork. Also got the sesame noodles and it's just noodles with peanut sauce with a slight spice. Friends ordered their crawfish and it was a total waste of money, 2 crawfish and some rice. Checking out was a pain in the butt, gave us all our change in coins. Worst experience Iv ever had! Overall will not return."}
