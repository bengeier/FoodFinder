{"text":"Had high hopes for this place always like to support local restaurants but this was terrible.  We ordered chicken fried rice, general tso chicken, bbq slice pork and beef singapore noodles.  The general tso chicken tasted bitter and was inedible. The  pork was dry, the rice was plain and tasteless and looked exactly like the young chow fried rice we also ordered. Most of the food went into the trash it was that bad.  The noodles were the only thing that was tolerable but have had better elsewhere.  Very very disappointing."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout from here a few days ago, had a couple of issues that garnered a 1-Star review.
The first problem was the fact that there was hair found in the food, notably in the largest portion of the food which was the vegetable stirfry.
I decided to try the other edible portions of the takeout. The Sweet and Sour Chicken was under-cooked, the chicken was very chewy and I suspected this from the chicken being under-cooked/raw.
The chicken rice tasted very soggy and was nothing special."}
{"text":"Food and service are fairly good. Excellent appetizers such and Siu Mai, Chicken wings etc. I would recommend it to a friend if everything else was closed."}
{"text":"Ruyi Garden used to be a favourite in my household but both the food and service here has become absolutely appalling. 

Each dish I ordered had something wrong with it, many to the point that they were inedible. An example of this being the chicken balls were rock hard, and could not be bit into."}
{"text":"The price and volume of food is all that saves this experience from a lower rating. Food is pure mediocrity at best; Not great at all but not bad either."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. They have an excellent selection of Cantonese, Szechuan and Thai food as well as a pretty nice offering of dim sum. My favourite dish is their Ruyi Garden Special Chow Mein that contains a variety of meats, veg and crispy noodles - love those crispy noodles. These are not the thick crispy noodles, they are like the thin egg noodles that every other place I've tried out here in Ontario seems to serve soggy only they've been crisped up. Yummy. It is just like the Cantonese Chow Mein I used to get in Vancouver.

They have delivery service through Taste Away but they always call to confirm the order voice-to-voice.

Their food, service and value are all wonderful and I am a regular customer.

{"text":"It was a mistake to order Thai food from here.  \"Famous\" pad Thai was probably the worst I've ever tried - tasteless, bland, sloppy wet; just wrong color, texture, and consistency.  Shrimp spring rolls contained skinny shrimps without any vegetables or at least some filling.  

Sweet and sour chicken flavour was ok, but the meat itself too hard to chew and crunchy like it was prepared a few days ago.

There must be some good Chinese dishes here, otherwise I'm not sure how they stay in business.  

Tip: don't order from Thai section of the menu"}
{"text":"Ordered take out; food was prepared quickly. Chicken balls weren't greasy or soggy, the beef & broccoli was good and not overly salty. The Shanghai noodles was a bit on the spicy side. No complaints, only thing is it somewhat lacks the \"fake Chinese\" feel. I would however, order from here again."}
{"text":"OK, I've visited Ruyi Garden a few times now so I should probably revise my original review from July 21, 2015.

First, the restaurant is gorgeous inside - they did an amazing job renovating it.  If anything, don't do the take-out but go inside and have a meal in there.  They can accommodate large groups too.  During my first visit, while I waited for my order, I had a nice conversation with the hostess; she was very friendly and welcoming.

Now on to the food: if you prefer Canadian/American style Chinese food (similar to Mandarin), you've found the perfect restaurant.  If you're like me and more into authentic Chinese food, then you should really research the menu well and ask questions prior to ordering.  They are very friendly and there is no language barrier.

I've had the following dishes:

Yeung Chow Fried Rice - had good flavour and they clearly used good quality ingredients such as lot of lean char siu, shrimp, fresh veggies, etc.  I would have preferred that the eggs were incorporated more like an omelette rather than mixed in with the rice.  Unfortunately, the rice was a bit overdone for my liking.

Crispy Ginger Beef - also had good flavour and, again, it was good quality - no fat or gristle.  We found that it had a little too much batter and the meat should have been cut into all thin, uniform slices to ensure every piece was crispy.  Also, the menu indicated it was spicy but we didn't taste any heat.

Shanghai Beef Noodles - the best of all three and authentic.  The only issue was the first time I ordered it, the noodles were cooked el dente (like most Asian noodles should be) but the dish lacked salt/seasoning; it was an easy fix with soy sauce though.  The second time I ordered it, it was perfectly seasoned BUT the noodles were a bit overdone so forget microwaving it for leftovers the next day as the noodles would just be cooked to mush.

Prices are decent, good portions and placed in nicer take-out containers (not Styrofoam that causes leaks).

I honestly think that if they focussed on being more authentic, they would see far more business.  Again, service is friendly but I find it a tad annoying that they phone me two to three times while I'm on my way to tell me the food is ready."}
{"text":"Super delicious food:) made fresh and ready to order, I have had delivery from here from just eat they were on time food was hot and tasted amazing

The inside of the restaurant as I've eaten there also is decorated modern, The portions served on the plates are quite large. I enjoyed their chop Suey, General tao, chicken fried rice, Beef with almond,The waitress who works there was super cute and sweet she had a really good personality she made me and my friend laugh a lot. 

The only reason why I'm giving it four stars is that it's not the best Chinese food I've ever had and a lot of the dishes on the menu represents kind of that Canadian/American Chinese version also their price is much higher than Chinatown which has more authentic"}
{"text":"I ordered for the first time, spent quite a bit for my office staff and the food was absolutely NOT good.  They gave us very small plates that we had to stop by grocery to get real/big plates, I didn't even finish my plate and we threw left over out.  I will never order from this place again.  The food was horrible!  It was a total waste."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant after receiving a menu in the mailbox awhile ago.  We were pleasantly surprised by the decor, the food and the service.  We had the beef ho fun, Szechuan eggplant and chop suey.  You could tell each was freshly and carefully prepared.  Even the chop suey which I normally wouldn't have ordered was very good and the eggplant was excellent.  The ho fun was also very good with a generous portion of beef.  The service was attentive and unobtrusive.  Decent street parking as well.  A gem in Etobicoke."}
{"text":"Excellent, fresh Chinese food. Corteous delivery. Reasonable prices. Comparable highly to freshness of Mandarin but I think better. Very good"}
