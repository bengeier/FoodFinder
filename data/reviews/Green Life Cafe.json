{"text":"In 2015 I had lunch at the Green Life Café, and recalled liking it.  The selection was all high-quality food, but not particularly memorable.  However, one Saturday afternoon I felt drawn to come back and take advantage of the nicely sunlit and cheerfully colored rooms, because I remembered the place had good energy.  I did not suspect how amazing of a meal I would be treating myself to!  The newly revamped menu has items that seem totally fresh and more innovative than the previously somewhat standard lunch fare.  True, the menu is primarily comprised of crepes (sweet or savory), smoothies, salads, and tea- but my savory curry-themed crepe was unlike anything I have ever tried before!  I am currently eating a purely plant-based diet, and I was pleased to find multiple gluten free & vegetarian/vegan friendly options.  My waitress, Mirabel, was very pleasant, attentive, and gracious like previous staff.  Her friendliness and cheerful pride that she took in her job complimented the great food and lovely ambiance that I experienced.  I look forward to my next trip to Green Life and highly recommend it to others!"}
{"text":"Wow! Amazing coconut oolong tea. Gorgeous seared tuna salad and fried plantains! I am throughly impressed. Beautiful presentation as well. I will be coming back often and bringing friends."}
{"text":"True Grit  Green Life Café wants to be all about the Zen experience and fully takes advantage of its cozy setting on Monroe Avenue in the former location of the Macha Tea House.  Unfortunately, they forgot about some basic restaurant tenants such as properly seasoning its food, thoroughly cleaning ingredients so customers don't get a mouthful of grit and periodically checking on its patrons during their dining experience.  The restaurant's cool quotient is high with fresh flowers on the tables, a citrus-infused water cooler, and plenty of hip knick-knacks sprinkled though its intimate setting.  The menu is limited, a number of smoothies, coffee drinks, wraps and crepes.  The person behind the counter didn't attempt to engage me as I perused the menu to offer any suggestions.  I elected to go with the $9 falafel breakfast wrap (falafel, scrambled eggs, roasted peppers and eggplant and mushrooms) and paid the $1 up charge to get the freshly made sweet potato fries.    The dish looked spectacular, with the deep orange fries contrasted against the green tortilla wrap with a pale yellow curry yogurt dipping sauce.  However, kitchen failed to put any crunch on the exterior of the falafel.  Both the wrap and the fries were woefully deficient of salt.  The bigger sin was that with every other bite, it felt like I bit into a grain of sand.   Not cool, Green Life, not cool, you've got to do a better job of cleaning your ingredients.  The last disappointment was the post sale service, or more precisely, the utter lack of post-sale service.  The restaurant was not exactly overrun with customers during my visit, so it disappointed me that neither front of house staff member ever checked in to see what I thought of my meal.    There are limited weekday breakfast options in this area, so I really hope that Green Life gets its act together.  While I will probably return at some point (I'm a sucker for a well-prepared savory crepe), I am going to give them a couple of months to get improve food offerings and their customer service."}
{"text":"amazing food! amazing atmosphere! truly a special place to have in madison! food is so fresh, they grow their own vegatables and herbs and fruit in the front of the restaurant. I will be back time and time again!!!"}
{"text":"When they first opened I really enjoyed their Wisco sandwich as well as salads. Also liked their smoothies. Now they got rid of their sandwiches and salads. They arent opened as advertised and their website if out of date. Something is going on with them. Call first before heading to them because most likely they arent open and you will waste a trip in. They could of really added a nice perk to the Monroe Street neighborhood but its just too inconsistent."}
