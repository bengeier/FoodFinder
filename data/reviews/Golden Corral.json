{"text":"Food was cold and didn't taste good then to top it off the manager was yelling at these two ladies and just being so rude when they went nicely up to him to inform him that they weren't satisfied with the food yeah after that I'm good I'd rather go to denny's"}
{"text":"Ive only gotten buffet to go.  Good price but everything was so greasy i wish I'd chosen another restraining to get to go from"}
{"text":"i was soo disappointed the second time i went.  The first time i went i thought it was great they had shrimp scampi, alfredo sauce, etc but the line was just horrendous. just went again for lunch and it was gross.  Y'know how your first bite is supposed to taste the best?  It already tasted bad.  The liver steak was disgusting; hard, overcooked, and just a peculiar taste in general.  The asian food was gross, mexican food was alright, and the southern style food was just too fried for me.  The only hot food i enjoyed was corn and the mini steakk burger with grilled onions.  However, i did enjoy the fresh salad bar and the ice cream bar.  All the cupcakes and cake had way too much icing on it, and i love icing!"}
{"text":"oh my.. our second time here and this restaurant is always crowded, super dirty, and not sure why, but always full of obnoxious customers with potty mouths.  I have 2 little ones and couldn't eat comfortably."}
{"text":"I went during lunch and everything was fresh. however,  the restaurant was not very clean, the bathroom smelled and our table was sticky.."}
{"text":"Always a great place to get filled up.  Food is prepared fresh and you can see them actually cooking and cutting up fruit, and baking.  The management seems to be very visable, which is always a good sign.  Large assortment of food.  The steak is usually very good, and love the flavor of the ham."}
{"text":"Food was good and lots of variety. Didn't like that they don't have a military discount.  There are a lot of military folks here that could benefit from it and feel appreciated at the same time. Also didn't like that the manager would not honor my sister's medical condition and allow her to take her plate of food home without charging  $5.99/lb. It was like double charging for her food. She could not eat the piece of chicken or the piece of steak that she put on her plate so instead of wasting the food she wanted to take it with her for later. Called the manager over to discuss and show her the medical certificate and the manager refused to let her take it without charging for it again. Otherwise it was good and deserved a higher star for food quality but for the reasons stated I will not be returning until they start to appreciate their military community and take better care of special needs customers."}
{"text":"Went to lunch today, had to wait in line for 30 minutes to get in. We were disappointed that they do not serve steak until supper, could not find their baby back ribs neither. However, their fry chichen was nice & crispy, popcorn shrimp were good, Asian food were ok; was not impressed with the dessert bar, the banana pudding & other desserts were not as good as the other locations we went to before; the staff were friendly & courteous. So glad this restaurant is finally here, hope they open up the other 2 locations soon!"}
{"text":"Been here twice for dinner. Food is always hot. Despite the fact that there is a huge line to get in which is no surprise considering it's the first one in Vegas it's worth the wait. I don't know why but I'm always a fan of crappy buffet pizza. Their garlic bread is tasty. They have your typical types of comfort foods( fried chicken, mac & cheese). The main star is their chocolate (milk & white) and caramel waterfall. Tried their white chocolate one, wasn't too impressed. Good price for dinner if you don't mind waiting."}
{"text":"I drove by many times while it was being renovated. Heard it was pretty good. So, a couple of days after its Grand Opening, a group of us decided to give it a try. The line was wrapped around the building. It looked like such a long wait. But looks can be deceiving. It took only about a good 15 minutes to get in and be seated. Anyways, let's get to the food review. Food was plentiful and ongoing, never had to wait for them to bring it out. Quality was good, service wasn't bad. But...the downside was, most items were extremely salty! Would I go back? There's a good chance, but hopefully the food won't been too salty the second time around."}
{"text":"Not a Fan of the entrance, or Location. Food was tasty but they ran out. My family and I drive to the one in Arizona for dinner every now and then. And that location in Arizona is great. SAD I will still have to drive to Arizona to eat there. Because I will not be returning to this location. Tried it twice and was disappointed twice."}
{"text":"Worst place ever! Sitting here having my dinner and they shut down the hot bar which was fine but the dessert bar too?? I'm still eating my dinner... Confused I keep eating and see one of the kitchen members throwing old food from inside the hot boxes right on the floor in front of us while we finish. How disgusting!"}
{"text":"Breakfast was terrible...how do you ruin breakfast.  It is like they are not even trying...I even complained, she pointed out they have made to order eggs and omelets.  That was almost edible...if I had started there maybe...so best tip I can give, \"start there!\"   It doesn't get better..."}
{"text":"personally been there twice, never had a problem or saw any of the complaints others have mentioned blows away hometown buffet my only gripe is trying to get a large piece of steak instead of small ones but it's always been cooked med rare to my liking love the bread pudding"}
{"text":"Saw Golden Corral commercial on TV for all you can eat ribs. Paid $15 to find out from the meat chef that they do not have ribs. Very disappointed. Other food wasn't very good. Sirloin steak was very tough and mostly grissle and no flavor. Golden Corral is much better than the food at Country Buffet. Better value to skip both and go to a non buffet. Try My Mother's Kitchen for American food non buffet. My Mother's Kitchen is awesome for less money than Golden Corral and the portions are really big."}
{"text":"One of the worst experiences ever at a restaurant! Floors and tables were filthy. Workers were grumpy. No baked potatoes available...do not go...yuck!!!"}
{"text":"Disneyland-lines to get into a buffet? No thanks. The food tastes good, but it's not worth the wait."}
{"text":"My family was looking forward to a pleasant end of year lunch at Golden Corral.  We rarely eat here so we were not aware of the pricing.  Well, we did not realize that Sundays had dinner pricing all day.  My husband politely asked the cashier why the pricing was higher.  She condescendingly stated that Sundays had dinner pricing plus our drinks... then she even used God's name to emphasize her point.  Did she really have to do that?  She never smiled nor make us feel welcome when we got there.  Now we will really not go back there at all.  There are 2 other buffets around that are more welcoming."}
{"text":"Well I went last night! It was pretty full and we were in line for say 15 minutes but the food is always amazing! they make the steak to how you like it and they have a very big salad and topping bar. Our waiter did the best he could due to the huge crowd of people.      I also really like how they display the fresh food in the back!      there are hardly any food lines and they refill the trays very quickly. The only problem i had was how many people were there and how loud it was."}
{"text":"Love the breakfast buffet very clean place the staff was great as well clean plates and eating here one of my favorite places would recommend this place to all of my friends but I really love the breakfast buffet"}
{"text":"I use to love this place everything was so fresh and full of flavor. I have no idea what happened they must not have the same people cooking because everything is bland and tasteless they use to have delicious Mac and cheese that was baked and gooey and cheesy now it taste like it came out of a box... So sad you use to be so good I don't think me and my family will be coming back its very sub par now."}
{"text":"I loved this Golden Corral! In my opinion, it is the best one in the Cleveland area. The servers were friendly and attentive. The bathroom was clean, and the food was great! I loved the catfish and hot wings! They were not typical \"buffet\" quality. They were well seasoned, and very tasty.  I added a lobster tail for $4.99, and the server gave me a carry out box to bring it home in, because I was too full to finish eating it! If you mention a carry out box in other buffet restaurants, the servers flip out--assuming that you want to take buffet items home.  Additionally, I enjoyed the Mac and Cheese, the fruit bar, the pork seasoned pinto beans, collard greens, fried okra, broccoli with cheese sauce, fried chicken, dinner rolls, and mashed potatoes with gravy.   For dessert, I sampled and enjoyed strawberries dipped in chocolate, hand packed butter pecan ice cream, vanilla soft served ice cream, chocolate chip and peanut butter cookies.  Everything was fantastic! Bring your appetite and enjoy!"}
{"text":"In recent years, the quality of their food has gone down. I use to love coming here to eat, and I particularly loved their fried chicken. On my last visit here, the chicken didn't taste as good as it usually was. I don't know if they are using a different brand or not.  Although, I am not a steak lover, theirs is still acceptable. So is the carved turkey and ham. The side dishes are OK..I enjoyed the mashed potatoes and gravy, the corn, and green beans.   I never cared for the pizza, their salad bar ( dressings are too mayonnaisey) , or taco station. I hate their ice cream, and I am not fond of their dessert bar (especially the under baked cookies).   However, the chocolate fountain is great! You can make your own chocolate covered fruit desserts, coconut squares, Rice Crispy squares."}
{"text":"This place usually rocks but not the location in las vegas. The food is bland and redundant. The food is always cold. The cashier are upset and impatient and always have atttitudes. The waiter never comes after he serves drinks so there a re a pile of plates stacked on the table. I get up and put then in the bus bucket myself The price is way to expensive for shitty food and they went up. For the amount of money you pay you can go to any of the hundreds of buffets vegas has for a better food."}
{"text":"Golden Corral has been one of my regular stable when I get a craving for clam chowder or sirloin strips. Most regular customers would agree with me that it is one of their signature dishes. No buffets in the LV can come close to the distinct flavors they have created. Unfortunately my latest return to GC has been a disaster! The line was long with just one cashier. But she was quick n efficient. The wait wasn't that long as I might have imagined. But when I was given a table n set to eat. That is where the disaster begins. Trash were all over the serving area. Most of the popular dishes wasn't replenished fast enough. And no one had a clue about the new Scallop BBQ skewers that were suppose to served which advertised on their website n storefront. When I saw lots of people was leaving impatiently. It should have been a red flag for me. But I was just too royal to leave before getting a taste of what I came for. Sadly the hr I spent there was just eating the scrap other customers were left behind!"}
{"text":"Ate dinner here and to my surprise it wasn't crowded! It was clean, spacious , and our waitress was attentive. Staff was friendly! The waitress even knew that I made my self an Arnold Palmer! She refilled me with a better version.   I'm rating this a 5 star because of the type of buffet it is. I'm not comparing it to Bachannal Buffet! For the type of food and quality....it was good!   My steak was cooked well, the fried fish, pot roast, veggies, sweet potato casserole, fried mushrooms, and dessert was good! Those yeast roles were on point!   We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great value! $15 for adult dinner which includes a soda. Great quality of food. Definitely better than \"buffet.\" Breakfast served all day with made to order omelets. Array of food not separate by ethnicity of food but by type of food. Made to order STEAKS! And chocolate fountain with marshmallows, strawberries and Rice Krispies for dipping!"}
{"text":"You know I had to rate a four on this one, went for dinner and had their steak, tasted much better than the five star, celebrity chef restaurants that I visit on the strip. A lot of their items were garbage, but if you know how to eat a lot of the items were quite good and yummy. Desserts were quite disappointing, they need to work a little on those. All in all for $30 date night not overly disappointing."}
{"text":"When the Golden Corral first opened we were very excited to have one in our area but when we went the first time we were very disappointed with the way it is set up.  Everything is crowded and people are practically climbing over each other to get to the chocolate fountain.  Getting from one end of the food selection s to the other is almost like a balancing act trying to hang on to your plate while dodging people!  I figured it was still new and that's why it was so crowded so we waited a few months before trying it again.  Last nite was worse!  The restrooms were a mess, the floors were wet, there was no toilet seat covers in some of the stalls and again, it was so crowded you had to dodge people to get anywhere.  People were rude, kids were running around and yelling....  THIS time we didn't stay....."}
{"text":"Five stars for the waitstaff, despite the 2 for the restaurant itself.  They were all friendly and kept our glasses filled and our empty plates cleared away.  The food was hit or miss.  The salad bar, for me, was a bright point.  I made a salad out of romaine and it was fresh as were the toppings.    The floor in this place was absolutely filthy.  It's winter so you expect some dirt but there were plenty of food bits lined up along the carpet edge.  It took a long time for tables to get cleared away.  The dishes are all plastic and eating off of them was kind of weird.  Seeing the scratch marks from so many eaters prior to my own visit was a little off-putting.  My 15 year old had been here with her grandparents in the past and she tried to warn us away.  We will listen in the future."}
{"text":"This place sucks donkey dick! I don't know what some people are talking about when comparing this place to other buffets on the strip, there is No... Comparing this to other buffets. I could deal with a long line but this place is so fricken Ghetto! The food sucks so... Fucking bad. Just go through a dam drive thru seriously, how the hell do you charge 15 per person and the selection of food is complete shit. Plate size, portion for steaks, salty ass friend chicken watery mash potatos, watery chocolate fountain, warm drinks, and before anyone says anything I seen the fricken kitchen when the door was open and there was shit all over the floor. It was a fucken mess.  Seriously, if you are gone spend even 15 bucks per person just go to the strip or another buffet where it is clean, the staff know what their doing, your not having people breathing down your neck and you will get to eat at a real buffet where the steak is not the size of half a cookie. Don't waste your money and your time, it is not worth it. If you don't believe it then good luck going there cause this place SUCKS!"}
{"text":"Perhaps the two star \"Meh. I've experienced better\" is the most accurate rating for the Brookpark Golden Corral. Now, the problem is that I've been once and there probably won't be a second chance to make a good first impression. When it comes to the other reviews about the messy buffets, at least that's understandable because that is the fellow diners making that mess (although hopefully the staff understands the need to pick up after them in a reasonable time frame) and there's not much you can do to clear a path around the kids there but with cotton candy as a buffet staple, the business point of view is clear... attracting families! The food choices and variety was halfway decent although \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" The Golden Corral was on my bucket list but with that crossed off, it's time to check out other dining options."}
{"text":"I usually Love Golden Corral but after yesterday I will NEVER eat at any of these restaurants again. Within an hour of leaving this location after eating lunch yesterday  i felt very sick. I am pretty sure that it is food poisoning as i have not been able to be away from a restroom for very long. The rest of my family didnt get sick however i am the only one who bit into some extremely pink chicken. It is now the next morning and i still feel awful. I may need to go to the hospital."}
{"text":"The food was tasty and our waiter (Mike) was very attentive & professional. HOWEVER.... IF you're going to give away Comet goldfish to children as prizes for winning games, please make sure none of thim have ICK (white spots, mostly on fins) and that the parents know these fish get over a foot long. They're pond fish. Ours \"Billy\" & five others I looked at had several ICK spots."}
{"text":"I can't believe anyone is complaining about this place. I have lived here for 12 years and I can say this was a great buffet, I thought the price, service, and food were great for a buffet. I originally thought it was stupid to have a buffet right down the street from boulder station, Arizona Charlie's , etc... But it actually made sense to me today, I went there with a friend for lunch today and it was great, I didn't have to walllkkkkk thru a huge casino to have my 1/2 lunch, it was great we got there at 11:50 and thankfully there was no line, when we were leaving yes there was a line about 15 people. But it was great I would recommend to everybody. Only downside is I don't cook with salt and it seemed like the Asian food was really salty, it might just be me. And FYI the restrooms were super clean."}
{"text":"I use to love going here. there. about this last visit was sad. many food items were empty, workers didn't keep up, on re stocking. some items were warm, at best room temp. However the server was on top of her job. cleaned plates quickly, and kept pops filled without having to ask."}
{"text":"Been to golden corral several times day and night. 8 times out of 10 no waitress around to get us our drinks. Need better service there."}
{"text":"When you go into Golden Corral it feels alright because the crew makes you feel like you are at home. But this place is far from home. Though the crew is nice there are only a select few, some of the crew were nasty and horrible. The food on one hand was downright disgusting. The food was very fatty and high calorie. The meat was sometimes under cooked and after I ate I felt horrible. So in all this restaurant was terrible"}
{"text":"Wish we had this choice in California. Good quality buffet, great variety, and much less expensive than the buffets we have here in southern California. Also, the price included beverage and dessert.  Yes, it can get noisy; however, that is to be expected in this type of facility."}
{"text":"Great service tonight, even though they were very busy. Erik,our server, was so polite and constantly refilling drinks. William, the grill master, said \"thank you for coming in tonight\" every time he served us a steak. Got to love good food and polite old fashioned service. Thanks for a happy experience!"}
{"text":"Food was okay.  The lady at the register had a smile but had a stupid look on her face like she had something stupid to say.  Some tall black guy that was probably the chef started following me around like I might eat too much at the buffet.  Also one of the bust boys kept hanging around my table and starring at my women like he might of wanted to say something to her.  Which would have made my day!  I felt uncomfortable there I wouldn't recommend eating there again.  The atmosphere is dramatic."}
{"text":"DeMarlo was a good waitor.. but would have preferred not to have my first bite of bourbon chicken have a jagged bone in it.. jammed into the roof of my mouth..  so I spent lunch barely able to eat.."}
{"text":"Went to this place last week with my wife, baby & mother in law for dinner. A couple of days later my baby started throwing up before bedtime & was sick for 3 days. I got sick right about the time she was getting better now my mother in law is sick too & my wife is starting to feel it. Instead of a nice meal from this horrible place. We went home with a doggybag full of the Norovirus. As most of the other reviews stated. The place is a filthy mess. Most of the supposedly clean plates & silverware still have food residue on them from the previous customer. I had to go through a stack before I could find a clean one. So if you want your whole family to get sick then this is your place. The health department should shut them down."}
{"text":"The workers were nice I guess, the food wasnt very good. Everything about the place just seemed so damn old the wallpaper plates, ceiling, and decor. You dont expect much from a buffet, I would like to feel a little cleaner while I eat. I typically dont eat buffets, but we dont have these in Minnesota and I thought we would try it."}
{"text":"I love coming here for the rolls & honey butter alone...Delish :) I totally have a food-gasm from eating them!!! This buffet wins hands down over any other. The last time I went to a buffet my sister (unfortunately) wanted to go to Old Country & it sucked hard-core. Dry food, unappetizing flavors, crappy choices, etc.  If you're wanting to stuff yourself silly go here...great selection of food to choose from. I especially like the sweet potatoes, Bourbon Street Chicken with rice, and meatloaf. Skip the mac 'n' cheese...very bland...blech.   The wait staff is ok, no one particulary friendly or fast, but I doubt anyone expects exemplary service from a buffet. This location is a bit better/cleaner than the other one at Stapley/Cooper."}
{"text":"Worst. Restaurant. Ever.  I saw long lines here ever since they opened, so I finally decided to check them out. The building is nice and the decor was what you would expect of a newer restaurant. However, the food was very mediocre and not edible. I left the restaurant feeling a little sick to my stomach, and as I'm writing this, I'm still wondering what I even ate there. There were also ants hidden in between the napkins on the table.  I still don't get why there are long lines here, and I probably won't ever be back here again. Go eat somewhere else - your body will thank you later!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try GG ever since I visited Texas. Most people who live there say it's an ok buffet, I guess I am just a sucker for anything new.  The problem with his location is the wait. Unless you have a tactical deployment plan with your friends to help secure a place in line, wait until they open another location or you can catch a window of opportunity.  We showed up around 2pm on a Friday, and there was about a 30 min wait.  The weekend prior was roughly about 2 hour wait.   Once you're actually inside, the line moves quickly.  They also seat you rather quickly as well.   Typical buffet fare, I think the highlight would be the Grill area and anything that comes out of there. Also the desserts are quite plentiful with various options like Cotton Candy.  I would come back, but not until the hype settles down."}
{"text":"Ok I have been here many times now. I love the salad bar. Steak cooked to order. Cabbage and Meat Loaf. All food is excellent and price is great too. Also the weekend breakfast is very good and includes your beverage for about $8.50. Give it a try."}
{"text":"i consider this the best buffet in town compared to old country & hometown. there is a large selection of all types of food. there is no skimping when it comes to food selection. they have a large dessert bar also with sugar free desserts. the desserts are awesome, not just the standard boring kinds like hometown. all the food has been really good. the lunch price is about $8. this does not include your drink. drinks are another $1.80.  dinner is about $10, not including your drink. service has always been good. the food is always great."}
{"text":"Meh. For the price, it isn't bad. I'm full, but I don't think I'll find myself ever craving to be here.   Foods I liked: The pork steak is pretty good but really salty. There is something called the fish...pasa?? Next to some guacamole and pico de gallo. It was good with both. Mashed potatoes and poultry gravy was good, but if you go wrong with mashed potatoes, you might as well quit now. Cookies and cream ice cream!  Foods I didn't like: I stopped eating the orange chicken a few bites in, as well as the lo mein. Their strawberries for the fondue machine weren't very fresh nor big. I was going to put the buffalo wings in the precious category, but they didn't make the cut. I got three pieces because I love wings, but only ate two, and the second was more because I wanted I give it another try instead of wanting to eat more. It tasted a little sour (might be because of the sauce??) and was not warm. Or hot. Little colder than lukewarm. Not cute. Their coffee is mediocre - not good, not bad - but not good enough to make it into the \"likes.\"  The tables are pretty cramped, and the soda machine is in the entrance where very one waits to get in. This is pretty inconvenient for people who want refills, but sometimes the servers will stop by and ask if you want one. I just make my brother get refills for me c: they also have a cotton candy machine (not self serve) and a chocolate fondue machine with skewers, marshmallows, cookies, strawberries and Rice Krispies if they haven't run out yet. Feel free to help yourself, but be warned that the chocolate is kind of runny so make sure you're not dripping on the way back to your table.  Basically, the food isn't terrible, but if I want to stop eating while I'm eating...that's pretty bad, especially because I'm not a picky eater."}
{"text":"Watch out if you think GC has healthy food.  If you go in and eat only the vegetables, they are soaking in MARGARINE made with hydrogenated soybean oil.  Soy is genetically modified and an endocrine disrupter.  For real butter, you have to ask your server - the \"butter\" they have out is actually margarine.  They use soybean oil for their deep fat frying (but this is not unusual.   I thought it was a good place to go, but the brussel sprouts/carrots/green beans, etc. are all swimming in margarine - which they determined years ago to have massive trans fats and to be worse than butter. It's good to know that GC will save a few bucks at the cost of their customer's health...."}
{"text":"Very good food.  Better than Hometown.  BBQ Chicken is excellent. Cotton candy is a must.  Price is reasonable. Expect a lengthy wait in line."}
{"text":"Waitress was very nice and responsive. A lot of hot food items were actually way under temp, potential for people to get sick. Very low quality food for the amount of money we paid."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by Golden Corral for lunch on April 30, 2014 1:30pm...I advise you to keep driving, don't stop. Why? 1. The front of the restaurant had a lot of trash...and it wasn't a windy day...first impression. 2. As you walk in you pick up a plastic tumbler for your beverage they are brown and not the color of the plastic brown...stained. They should just buy the brown ones. And the plates should go also...presentation goes along way. 3. No one greeted us and since it was our first time (last) visiting it would have been helpful to be informed of Golden Corrals process. Normally you pay before you get your drink...weird. 4. As we were looking for somewhere to sit...that was difficult because the floor was dirty, rolls stuck in the leg of chair and crumbs at more than one table and around the serving stations (it wasn't too crowded to do a quick sweep)...no one had a roller broom (Wal-Mart is across the street).  5. Then we had to find someone to wipe off a table, she didn't touch the seat that had crumbs, did it myself. 6. The DEAL BREAKER...we went to the back section by the waitress beverage station to visit with friends. We were HIT with that sour SMELL when a restaurant hasn't changed the water they are using to wiping the tables with for some time...Golden Corral please put a cap full of bleach or   hydrogen peroxide in your water if you aren't going to change it! That smell makes it hard to enjoy your food, our friends has sinus problems that day...lucky for you! 7. Before we could get out of the parking lot we were both feeling sick to our stomachs. Yes we should have ran at the front door, but we were trying to support the community.   If you are brave we give the food a 2  1/2 out of 5. Good luck!"}
{"text":"Okay, so this was our first time here and I would never return. Everything was filthy! Including cups, plates, silverware. None of the food looked appetizing. We did come at 7 pm but that really should be no excuse. We complained to the supposed manager Kathy and she was very rude and could care less about what we had to say. What a great manager! So, on top of the crappy food the customer service is terrible! No wonder this place is the way it is. My family really wanted to enjoy this place but we couldnt."}
{"text":"A basic buffet style restaurant, Golden Corral offers a lot for a relatively low price. Does this mean the restaurant is good? Not necessarily. Read on...  (Scales are 1-5, same as Yelp ratings)  Atmosphere: 1  During peak hours for breakfast, lunch and dinner, the place is jam packed with seniors and families. Fortunately, the restaurant has a decent amount of seating, but you'll still feel like you're packed into a sardine can. Additionally, the food is REALLY close to the seating, making eating very uncomfortable as people pass by you to get seconds (or thirds, fourths...).   Service: 3  I can't really complain too much about the service since a buffet is naturally self serve. But, the employees at the cash register were prompt and the waitress serving drinks was relatively attentive. I gave the service a 3 largely because I found that the food servers failed to refill food bins on a timely basis. Additionally, the deserts area was a mess. A lot of the pastries and cakes had to be taken by hand. The area was generally dirty given chocolate stains and ice cream droppings. Reminded me a lot of my days in the dorm dining halls in college.  Food: 2  Ever been to an average Las Vegas buffet? This, for the most part, mimics it. Largely American based foods, with Americanized ethnic foods (orange chicken, burritos). The food is kept hot. And, I admit, the food can be tasty. There are vegetarian offerings. The desert section is limited, especially for those with diabetes.   Cost: 3.5  You can't beat the cost of a buffet if you eat a lot. So, quantity will typically match cost. If you are a senior or a child, there is a nice reduction.   Pros: Decent cost. Certain dishes are tasty.  Cons: During peak hours, jam packed and very uncomfortable. Buffet offers basic American or Americanized foods. Desert section is lacking and disorganized.  In sum, avoid this place like the plague during peak hours. Go here only if you want quantity. If you want a real Buffet, go to Vegas.  Sample Size: I have eaten here once in the last year."}
{"text":"Awful. Just disgusting. Cold food. Not going back. Yuck!!! But at least they finally got rid of that chocolate germ fountain!"}
{"text":"My son and I ate Dinner there on a Saturday night and we found the dining experience to be entirely satisfactory.  The food looked and tasted great, the restaurant was clean and tidy, the wait staff was both efficient and friendly.   I especially enjoyed the Southern Fried Catfish, it was crisp, flakey, and very tasty. The best I've had in Pennsylvania.  I will go back again, but I think I'll make it on another weekend night vs a weekday."}
{"text":"Went a little late in the day.  Service was excellent, the food Hot and Cold as needed.  The food I selected was tasty.   The place was clean.   Everytime we eat here we always are very satisfied with everything."}
{"text":"Overpriced for what they serve, bad service, and not a nice place. For a buffet, Red Rock is a best option for the same price."}
{"text":"Prices are too high, especially on Sunday. The atmosphere is not inviting. The restrooms are messy. I doubt the level of cleanliness in the kitchen. Not worth the price. Look elsewhere!"}
{"text":"I get pist off when a buffet charges for beverages. The beverage is not included in the food price. The place is super crowded. They serve pork steaks instead of beef steaks. The food was too salty and the price was high."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed golden corral .. It was surprisingly clean and service was amazing .. The food was piping hot Friday November 20 around 12 in the afternoon . Alicia was my server very helpful she litteraly stopped by my table 6/7 times to ask if I needed anything . food workers were helpful when I didn't no what the food consist of . overall I had a amazing experience food was delicious service was great . the price was ok as well I just hated the drink is sold seperately . I will be back soon"}
{"text":"Let  me start by saying that my husband and I have been coming here since our dating years lol (about 5-6 years ago) and we come really often, like 3 sundays out of the month, and we still love it! Now we come with our 2 boys and guess what? They love it too!!  Pros-pretty much everything, specially their pot roast ?(^?^)? Cons-staff is great, except for this one girl that I always forget her name, we have seen her over the years grow from a server, to a cashier and I guess she is like an assistant manager now but she is so rude!! I will get her name and post it next time we go!  Get her fired and then this place gets a 5 star!! Lol"}
{"text":"The only reason why I'm even giving it one star is because you have to in order to write a review.I love food and I'm pretty easy going it's not really much that I won't eat or don't enjoy eating so for my birthday it was decided we would just go to Golden Corral to enjoy a buffet style dinner, to my surprise and shock there wasn't really a lot to choose from and everything that was out did not look that enticing the one thing that was pretty decent was the pot roast and when I got ready to go back for a second helping they had already put the new pot roast out but for some odd reason it didn't taste as good as the first one, the only other thing that was good was the cotton candy but of course they seemed either stingy or too lazy to fill the bag up completely,my boyfriend and stepfather even complain that the ice cream had no taste,how in the world can you possibly mess up ice cream he also wrote his own review,in both our opinion and my family unfortunately we will never return to this Golden Corral we may try the one on Brookpark and if that's not good then it just looks like there is no golden corrals in Ohio"}
{"text":"Lines are WAY too long for overly salty foods. I guess people only come here for the cheap prices. For some reason, I prefer Hometown Buffet more but I am the only one haha. Although the chocolate dipped strawberries are kinda fun!"}
{"text":"Def cleaned up since the last time I was here AND they have fried green tomatoes & chicken livers?!?! OH YEAH!"}
{"text":"Voted best buffet in mesa for a reason.  breakfast costs about $7.00 and comes with a complimentry drink or coffie.  Breakfast includes all you can eat steak, eggs, bacon, made to order omlettes, and much much more.  For Lunch they do not have steak but they have a new special everyday. My favorite is the fish fridays.  the pot roast is amazing.  For dinner they have a new theme every month or so.  Right now it is seafood including an amazing newberg, coconut shrimp,  and an amazing clam chowder or cheese and brocley soup.  The restaraunt is set up so there are 4 main dining rooms and a banquet room which is perfect for big family events or buissness afairs.  this golden corral in Mesa has one of the best management teams i have ever met.  These are people that you can tell truly care about what the guest thinks about the golden corral.  If you go to one restaurant this year, go to golden corral!  well worth every doller."}
{"text":"Well first of all if I'm going to pay $17 for a buffet I expect quality service. Unfortunately this did not happen. The young girl who was supposed to be my server greeted me after I was there for 10 minutes then I never saw her again. After finishing my salad my tea was empty... so I moved to another section and they young guy (server) was awesome. I asked to speak to a manager. The manager came out and spoke to me and apologized and said he would talk to the other server. Unfortunately speaking to someone now days doesn't get the job done... oh this will be the last time I visit this Golden Corral!!!!"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch today.  It was my first and LAST time!  Atmosphere:  When I opened the door, it smelled like a bathroom that needs to be bleached!  OK, so ignore the smell, maybe its just the wonderful fresh air is playing with my senses.   However, half way through our meal, the waitress was pouring hot water from a coffee pot onto the carpet and scrubbing the floor with her broom, then sweep it into a dustpan.  Did someone just puke there?  or was it a food mess?  but why pour water onto carpet that people are walking on, its not going to dry!    Took a good look at the carpet, it looks like its been there for 20 years and never cleaned.  Service:  The waiter got us water and came back once to ask if we were OK.  He walked by several times to service the table next to us (they had 8 people, we had 5) but didn't bother picking up our plates.  We ended up putting our plates on a nearby table so we can get the table clear.    Food:  Decent.  Some items were bland.  Some were good.  Some were over cooked.  I really like the multigrain bread roll.  Clam chowder was ok.  Chocolate fondue was the best part of the meal.  But were are never going back to this location again.  Eating while the place smells like the bathroom is not very appetizing."}
{"text":"The food is okay. Not great. Just okay. They use too much pepper in their fried foods, perhaps because they don't have much flavor on their own. The fries are mushy. Good selection of other foods.  Nachos are great.  The chocolate fountains are a draw for kids but are really kind of scary if you watch what goes on at them. With 3 different fountains in 3 different flavors you get people sticking stuff in one after the other so all 3 are mixed since the stuff recycles and there are food particles all around them. The items they serve to dip are horrendously dried out or wilted. I really don't know why the fountains are so popular with any adult.  The one real complaint I have is that you have to rely on wait staff to get drink refills. By wait I mean waaaait... we were there nearly a half hour before our server breezed by our table. The one refill we got was because I got up and went to the register myself. I've been to Golden Corral before and this is par for the course."}
{"text":"I went there with my family food was horrible took like 10 mins for the waitress to get me a refill then for desert I got angle food cake it was hard as a rock."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this Golden Corral for over 12 years. It was one of the greatest Buffets over the years. BUT... this location in Concord is old and despite several renovations it has a major problem with infestations of roaches. I personally have brought it to the local management at this location ..the management at at one of this franchises other location and to a CORPORATE Quality Control Team  did not seem to see there was a problem. Either myself or my wife have seen roaches on the salad bar or desert bar no less than 4 out of five visits. The last visit was when the \"Quality Control Team was in the store. I will never cross the threshold again. The Tyvola Rd location in the University area is in the same franchise and we enjoy dining there often."}
{"text":"If you're not picky the food is good. Salad bar is good. Dessert bar is wonderful. Chicken enchiladas look good but were like rubber. Ham was ok. Meat loaf was barely ok. Chinese wasn't good.  Service on the floor was nonexistent. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Okay so here's a review for this place:  First off I see a lot of people complaining about the level of children in this place, and to all those defending the kids, yes I totally understand this is a family buffet and there's a lot food aimed towards children, but even as a young adult myself, I also kinda have to side with the complainers here. I didn't have a problem with the level of children, but I DID have a problem with how some of them acted around there, it wasn't even the smallest kids, but kids around 6-10 years old that were the most irritating. I cannot tell you how many times they would just cut in randomly and take food, or touch food and not take it. The worst was when I was about to pick up the utensils to grab the last garlic bread some kid came up and took it with her bare hands! I mean uh parents of these kids can you at least take a little effort in how your kids act when going out? Yes their kids, yes they don't care about others but COME ON, I REALLY don't want your kids touching food I'm about to eat thanks, and I'd also like to grab the food I waited in line to get next, but whatever, it didn't bother me that much to a point where I wouldn't come back solely because of that.  BUT minus the kids, which really isn't too much of a big deal, I really liked this place. They have a really great varieties of food, and most importantly, they know how to do it right! Nothing tasted off or anything you'd expect from a typical buffet. And yes, they do have steaks at this buffet! They aren't the best steaks, but they're still better than most places. I honestly don't think there wasn't one thing I got here that I did not like.   The best thing about this place for me, which totally made this place ever better was their dessert section! One of the BEST casual buffet dessert places I've been to. The flagship dessert item here is their large chocolate fondue fountain! It is amazing in every way you can dip rice crispy, marshmallows, sugar cookies, and also strawberries! They also have real ice cream besides your typical frozen dairy sludge that melts in seconds, and also which totally took me by surprise, they make cotton candy freshly made!   Overall, I really enjoyed this place, its so much better than Hometown in every way, the food was excellent, and that's why it deserves 4 stars. The only other problem besides the level of kids, which regardless still won't keep me away from coming back, is their setup when you first walk in, you get your cup and drink before you pay and then you kinda have to stand at the register with a soda that will probably be half finished before you even reach your table. The line wasn't too bad when I got there, about 10 -15 minutes, and for the record, you WANT their to be a wait especially for a buffet! Why? Because that means people are constantly getting food meaning things will be replaced more often and therefore fresh food that hasn't been sitting there under a heat lamp.  Will defiantly be coming back!"}
{"text":"I do love this place!! The only problem is, some people (mostly children) are really messy and sometimes different foods will get mixed in with other foods which could cause an issue if someone had a food allergy or something. I've really never had a bad meal here; the food is good, hot and fresh. The servers could use a little work on their customer service skills although most are nice for the most part. You definitely get what you pay for. The only real problem is crowding and it's a pain if you get seated next to a huge group with a bunch of screaming kids running around. That happened to my husband and myself once; we simply asked to be moved to another table and the server was very cool about it :)  One of the best buffets around!!"}
{"text":"Not impressed!!!  I intentionally waited awhile after they opened to avoid the craziness... FAIL!!! The line was crazy long which is fine, you finally get inside to be greeted by a soda fountain but OOPS!!! Out of everything except diet crap!!!  15 minutes later upon FINALLY reaching the register, $15 a person??? OUCH!!! After waiting behind a pack of screeching children to finally be seated, I make my way to the food and no big surprise...  more empty platters and disappointment!!! They didn't even have two of three Chocolate Fountain flavors!!! I'll stick to Stations Feast thank you very much!!!"}
{"text":"We went tonight for the annual Military Appreciation Dinner.  The line was around the building, but they were moving people in and out pretty fast.  The servers and staff along with the JROTC that were volunteers for the evening were very organized and were able to seat people rather quickly.  The food was good, they were maintaining the buffet regularly, and everything was very good.  Thank you Golden Corral for supporting the military"}
{"text":"Well it was Easter Sunday when we went in and man were they busy. So I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and say that maybe on not so busy days they keep it together a little better? The food was mediocre for the price ($35 for two- yikes) and the fact that we can't get our own drinks and have to wait for a waiter to refill our drinks is ridiculous it's a buffet hello. The waiter was sooo nice and he was doing his best to keep up but it was just so busy."}
{"text":"The GC...  Me and my g/f would come here once in a while if we have no idea what we are craving but want some variety. I try to stay away from any of the carbs or starches since it can be a hit or miss with them. The salad bar is pretty decent and same goes with the foods being grilled.   The service is always good every time we've gone. The waitress are always very nice and fairly prompt.   The chocolate fountain is a nice addition to the desert menu  Overall, the GC is decent buffet place. Not my top choice but sometimes it's my last resort choice."}
{"text":"Stopped there 6 weeks ago for breakfast.  Great. Till the cantaloupe tasted like fuel. Called a manager and he took a sample to the older blond overweight boss. She came to my table and denied that hers tasted the same. A lady seated nearby spoke up and said the day before it did too. Manager type cranky woman all but called us liars. Fast forward to yesterday. Now the cantaloupe tasted like dirt. Left it on my plate. Someone recently told me there was a problem with cantaloupe tasting like fuel last summer. I wanted to throw it at the same cranky lady sitting stuffing her mouth 2 tables away.  Talk about  rude. No other complaints except they peel potatoes in a loud grinder in the salad area that should be done away from those trying to speak to one another.  I have worked in restaurants. That is kitchen work, not when 500 people can hear it. Otherwise...good food. Clean.  Needs replacing blond cranky lady."}
{"text":"Love this place! The only Golden Corral Location I'll eat at, and I live in Mecklenburg!"}
{"text":"We chose this restaurant after leaving the hard rock casino in northfield. The restaurant was extremely busy this Sunday evening. It was a seat yourself tonight. There was so many tables that were not cleaned leaving the seating selection very limited. Our server did not come around very often to refill drinks until we found the general manager. The restaurant was kinda dirty due to all employees just choosing to not take pride in cleaning up. The food was good as to expect from here as we have eaten at golden coral in the past. Before we left the general manager provided us with passes to come back again on them. I think it would have been a 4 star experience is they had not been so busy."}
{"text":"I ate here last night with my family and was very pleased with the place.  We went right at dinner time and they weren't very busy at all.  We had no problems finding a table to accomidate my family of 5.  The plates and silverware were stacked at the front and was easily accessed.   The food was something else.  I had some Louisiana chicken and rice that was really good and I also had some Beef Pot Roast that was loscious and tender, and some mashed potatoes and gravy that reminded me of the comfort food of my mothers.  My wife did have a slice of their meatloaf and it was very dry and neutral on the taste.  Probably because of how dry it was.  The desserts were the average kind of desserts and were tasty but not out of this world.  The waitress was very attentive and did a wonderful job with my three young children and all their demands.  The place was very clean and organized.   We will come to this location again even though there is one closer to our home."}
{"text":"My husband and I were very impressed with the wide variety of food available at this buffet.  The quality of the food was quite wonderful as well.  The service, however, was horrible.  The server asked me 3 different times what I was drinking before she finally brought it to me 20 minutes later!  She never cleared the plates off of our very small table, and wasn't very friendly either.  I am sure we will return and try to steer clear of the horrible waitress."}
{"text":"This place is packed on certain holidays. I think it smells horrible. If you go near closing time, there is a big difference starting about an hour before they close. The guy grilling steaks, who you would think loves his job, seems inconvenienced anytime he is asked for one. The chinese stir fry is not even as good as panda's in my opinion. The pizza is worse than some frozen types. I even like waffle houses chili more than the chili they serve here. This is a good place to just load up on as much crap as you can eat before puking, if you don't care about your health enough to eat somewhere that has better quality food."}
{"text":"I called three times to assure the restaurant had sugar free desserts and all three time jazmin would hang the phone on me little did she know I was going to take 103 federal employees. I will take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Buffet was decent. I recommend trying the fried chicken. Too much food for me though. Service was so so, took a minute for my drinks ."}
{"text":"went to eat here this evening with my baby sister for 4th of July! I was actually starving this time! Lol- the food was actually not that bad today! I ate 2 plates! The rolls are to die for! As for the dessert buffet is too! You can't get enough!     I don't like that the bathrooms are always stinking and the floors are disgusting - not sure why they can't use bathroom cleaner and a air freshener! Also I think it's a lil pricey for the food you eat cause sometimes it's not that great! My server Kim was awesome though she kept my Tea at tip top! She was really nice as well! Other then that it's ok I guess!!!"}
{"text":"I will tell you, the commercials for this place is definately misleading. The food is mediocre at best. Cleanliness is not there. This place is disgusting. Bathrooms are filthy and the \"clean\" plates were covered in food. Way overpriced for what you get and to top it off is in the GHETTO. I will never come back here and hope that those of you who read reviews don't either."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of buffets, and this one doesn't make an exception!! But i guess when you hungry anything is good"}
{"text":"You know what out of all the buffets I been to I can honestly say I loved this place. The food was actually good.  Didnt taste old or dry like some other places I have been too. The food actually tasted fresh when I went. The prices weren't to bad. I paid 46 bucks for 4 people. And they all enjoyed the food.   Amazing staff. Always refilling our drink, and clearing our tables.   The desserts were amazingly good.  Will come back for sure."}
{"text":"None of the food is too extravagant. All basic foods and there's a big variety but after eating I began to feel sick because of the food. Thought it was just an isolated incident but after reading others' reviews I see I wasn't the only one."}
{"text":"Great staff always busy but always willing to help. Love the sirloin steak and the deserts are wonderful. I would recommend going for breakfast. Omelette chef is happy and makes a great omelette. Prices are good for amount and quality of food."}
{"text":"I did not like the food at all. Maybe it was because we arrived an hour before they closed I don't know. The food was not presented in a clean manner. There was food mixed up with other foods and I thought it was safe to try the Pot Roast but it was dry. The desert table was a mess. There was cake frosting everywhere and pie and brownie crumbs in the jello. I skipped on desert and skipped on a second helping. The service was nice and attentive it was not helping my appetite. I it just could have been a bad day, but being a lover of buffets. I do not think I will be back. My search continues for a good buffet.I hear they are open for breakfast. Maybe that would be better. It would be hard to mess up a scramble egg."}
{"text":"Found 2 long nice pieces of hair in my salad. Not to happy about that. I'm a big fan of this chain of restaurant always have been they never really let me down at all. So I was surprised to find two pieces of hair in my food. the lady who gives you your refills was super friendly and attentive. And the rest of the food was good like it usually is. Some of the workers at this location though back behind in the kitchen on the salad bar side where I found my hair don't look too happy and I did see a couple of them practice some unsanitary techniques by on the salad bar side. I don't know but the manager needs to check out the lady who preps the salad area."}
{"text":"Cucumbers were frozen, waited and waited while the cook for the steaks helped everyone that spoke Spanish and everyone of color but wouldn't take my order as in white felt very discriminated against spoke with the manger about this all she offered was to get me the steaks which at that point it took so long that I had gotten other food cause I was hungry, rest of salad bar was good very tasty, chow mien noodles where nasty, the burden chicken was very good. The carrot cake was dry as was the fudge and brownie cake, the tarts area said flirt tart but it was a coconut cream tart and some chocolate cream tart both of which was nasty but the cotton candy was good. The employees were very rude the place was disorganized and at one point it they lost power. Can say we will never return which is too bad cause the one in rapid city South Dakota kicks this places butt sorry but you guys need a lot of work might want to look at management  as a former food and beverage supervisor this never would have happen and near did."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night at 7.  The line wasn't that long. Got in within 10 minutes.  After seeing all the commercials I decided to give this place a try.  The selection looked ok.  I tried the fried chicken which was nothing special. The pot roast was lacking flavor. The sirloin steak was very tough to chew and overcooked. I asked for rare and was given medium. The teriyaki steak was also overcooked. The sauce was ok. The bourbon chicken was tasty and was the clam chowder.  Their salad bar was ok but the tomatoes and onions should have been diced. The side order of lobster tail was a 3 oz tail. This was the best thing on the menu.  Overeall not better than your average casino buffet."}
{"text":"This place is seriously overrated. The line was out the door and packed inside. Waited a while and food not at all that great. Station casinos have MUCH better buffets for almost have the price. It seemed like I was in a cafeteria or soup kitchen. It was unorganized and people all over the place. Really messy dessert station."}
{"text":"Only on my second plate but i cant be more happy to say when i forst arrived my soda was flat the owner changed the syrup and brought me 2 sodas... much better i can tell the staff work very well together and i work in customer service so i know the drama in the work place i over hear convos from workers and only hear positive things which is great becuase when you go to a resturant you only usually hear all the negative stuff ...Great food totally worth it ...i always enjoy coming here but i will say today i am very impressed!!!"}
{"text":"I have been waiting for a Vegas location forever. After seeing all of the commercials on tv, it was getting irritating that there was not one here. I am glad they finally opened. There was about a 30 minute wait to get inside, but well worth it. The food was high quality and my son loved the dessert area. My only gripe would be the chaos that goes along with any buffet. Only this is in a smaller area, so it was more noticeable. The service was fantastic! I will definitely be back again. They should open a couple more locations. AND THE PRICE WAS AMAZING!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"So I was reading through the reviews of this place and I see that they are a bit dated so im going to update a few things for you guys! They now let you get your own utensils and plates instead of giving them to you when you pay.Yes it is crowded but hey its good and cheap come on now! And yes there are alot of kids running around but I dont really mind it all that much since I have two kids of my own.....now dont think that im letting my kids run around this place because Im a better parent that that! The food is good,I really dont see a problem with it at all! I really dont care where things are located on the buffet line as along as they are there im happy and I dont mind walking a few feet to get my salad! The rolls are amazing with the honey butter and I cant get enough of them. And a tip....wear something warm,they crank up the ac so its freezing in there....pretty sure they do it to make people leave quicker! I have had one bad waitress here and we told the manager about it,they ended up giving us a whole box of fresh buns and honey butter to go! yum! so as long as the food is good and they dont have flies in their food which happened to me last week at souper salad then im a fan!"}
{"text":"...it's been a long while since i had the chance to hit up Golden Corral (May 2008) because they were not located in SoCal.  This visit was not bad for what I would have expected from a buffet.  I appreciated the selection although I was not able to take advantage of it.  my company did though.  they enjoyed, enjoyed, and then enjoyed the food (some more).  The wait was outside of the front doors but it moved.  the staff was friendly and prompt with updates on the wait, seating, etc.  the food looked very fresh (on numerous times I saw the cooks bring out new stuff).  i also managed to visit the facilities and they were clean despite the place being packed.  there was a line for the lady's room though.  i'm not big on buffets so this would not be my first choice to visit when i'm up in the rowland of heights (i'd prolly do korean) but it was great when traveling with company who would not be open to food outside of american.  thanks for the memory, see you again in 5 years..."}
{"text":"My family and I had been wanting to check this place out ever since we had seen the commercials, and I'm guessing many people are on the same boat.   In all honesty I'm glad I got to check it out, but I won't be back and I would not recommend it. It was super crowded and when we got there the end of the line was outside the building.  The food is edible but nothing great and for the same price I could go eat at a station casino and get better quality food. But I'm giving them three stars because their staff provided good service and was friendly:)"}
{"text":"My hubby and I have eaten at Golden Corral for years. It feels like we've been to tons of them between southern California to Florida, and now here in Gastonia.    This one in Gastonia was very busy and crowded...nothing unusual, there.  Actually, if they WEREN'T busy and crowded, I'd think something was wrong with the food.  Lol.      The staff stayed busy cleaning tables, sweeping up food and trash from the carpeting, mopping up spills, refilling food buffet areas, bringing out clean dishes and silverware, getting things for customers (like high chairs, replacement silverware, etc,) and still smiling and being helpful and polite.    It did seem that the staffing could be a little better since sometimes a server would be doing two or three things at once, and not always able to refill a drink or clean an empty table right away.  For this, I don't blame the servers one bit as not even one of them was just standing around, doing nothing.  Instead, it's the Manager's responsibility to make sure there's adequate staffing instead of simply having servers do the work of two or three people...something that Golden Corral, in general, sadly seems to be 'famous' for.  (This is one chain I would not work for!)   The food was the usual fare that this chain provides, and was good at this location.  Hot food was hot, cold food was cold, and the salad fixings were fresh.  Empty buffet trays were replaced with fresh trays in a timely manner, and even the dressings, sauces, sour cream and butter/margarine were kept filled.   Loved the flavor of the New England Clam Chowder even though it was more 'milky' than 'creamy'.  (What can I say...I'm a spoiled New Englander. Lol).  The Broccoli/cheese soup was very good!  Sadly, the chocolate and caramel fountains were just as 'thinned out' as in other GC places that we've been to.  (sigh)  I know...it's expensive.    The meatloaf, itself, was great but a bit overpowered by all the ketchup on top of it.  I scraped off most of it and still had a good 'ketchup' taste.   (I have this hope that someday GC everywhere will start using gravy on the meatloaf or at least cut the ketchup quantity in half.)   I loved the tuna salad...tasted fresh and had no relish or pickles in it.  Just chunk light tuna and mayo to which I added some scallions, diced hard cooked egg, jalapenos, black olives and cut up tomatoes.  YUMMM!  (Plus a bit more mayo which it definitely needed after I got done with it.)     I love fried chicken but theirs was a bit overdone and dry so I passed on it.    The Sweet Potato Casserole with mini marshmallows was delicious, the baked potato was just okay, and the instant mashed potatoes were fine...especially since it's kind of hard to screw instant potatoes up!    The veggies were the usual...nothing special to write home about since half of them come from cans anyway and nothing extra is done to them.  (I do love the canned carrots, though.  Guess I've developed a taste for them. Lol.)  The canned collard greens are cut up but were a bit tough and a little bitter...should have been seasoned with some ham, bacon, salt pork or smoked pork hocks.  Anything to give it some flavor!  The brussel sprouts, broccolli and cauliflower had to be cut with a knife.  Very chewy.  Maybe they're healthier this way but I, for one, don't like them hard.  Even HALF cooked would be an improvement IMO.  The Pot Roast in gravy was tender, seasoned just right, and wonderful.  This pan emptied fast, too!  While I love seafood, the battered shrimp was just a little too 'battered' for my liking so I took most of the batter off of each shrimp before eating them...still tasted good!  The broiled white fish was pretty good, and the salmon was great.  I loved the Mac 'N Cheese as usual. (Hey, not everything that comes from a can tastes bad.)...and it tasted even better once grated cheese was put on top!  Yummm.   While I didn't get any food cooked specifically for me, like steak, other people seemed happy with what they were receiving.    The Prime Rib piece that the Carver cut off for my hubby wasn't a slice but a chunk...very tough to eat and not enjoyable at all.  My husband tried to eat it but gave up after a few tries.  True, he could have gone up with another clean plate and requested a real slice this time but he just didn't want the hassle of waiting...requesting...and maybe even then not getting what he wanted.      All in all, if you've eaten at one Golden Corral, you've eaten at all of them.  The selection stays pretty uniform, and you know ahead of time that the food will be decent, no matter what state you're in.  There's really no surprises with them...including this one in Gastonia.  The only thing that seems to change is the price which is up to about $20 per person, here.  (Hint: The Passion Grill in Gastonia...another buffet you might want to look at.)"}
{"text":"No stars should be given I had to give a star just to post  absolutely horrible.....even the ice cream was terrible....how do you mess up ice cream.....the one good thing was the cotton candy but they were stingy with that only filling the bag up a little....we will never go back"}
{"text":"I don't normally like giving chains the thumbs-up but I have to give it to this one.  I first was introduced to Golden Corrals years ago in the South  ( maybe North Carolina )  and well in luv with the endless choices of meats, veggies, sides and the ding-ding of the bell which means fresh baked goods like bread and muffins.  Everything from steak to chicken to pulled-pork to shrimp to pasta, etc. is available and a huge area just with desserts will also make you smile.  Come one, come all and bring your appetite!"}
{"text":"Food....normally a good experience, excellent for buffet food. Steak is actually tasty, there are several shrimp choices, and the desserts are plentiful. I have seven children so satisfying everyone can be daunting at times but not here. Everyone leaves satisfied here.  Ambiance...ummm, I should probably use the word setting. Not always the cleanest place. The restrooms have a lot to be desired. (Teach your kids to open restroom doors with paper towels). This did not affect my rating but the restaurant draws a clientele that is often dirty and rude. We have been here on numerous occasions and I always feel crowded.  Staff....over worked and under paid. I have had good waitresses and bad ones. It's just luck of the draw.  Verdict...if you are hungry then this is a good choice. Almost everyone can find something they enjoy here but I would not take out of town guests here as the ambiance is lacking."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly waitresses. Favorite Golden Corral in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Yeah, ok, got there just before a hugh line started for lunch.  Dinner is impossible.  Sorry not willing to wait an hours for dinner.  So as far as the food goes, it a little better than Hometown, and the price for lunch $8. and some change was not too bad. I did notice that breakfast is slightly higher by about .50 cents but still under $9.  Not sure why.  But here's the review on the food.  The steak, which everyone is  supposedly coming here for is a chuck steak, generally about $1.99 per pound in the market, generally we (butchers) make ground beef from this and sell it at $3.99 per pound.  So its tough and chewy.  So when I initially saw it, I was surprised they would be charbroiling it.  I love charbroil, instead of pan or griddle fried.  But not to be disappointed, they threw the cooked steak onto the flat griddle to continue cooking and cutting the steak into smaller strips. Not only does this double cook the steak to well done, but also make it drier and more tough.  Total waste of meat.  I liked the hamburger sliders, but too much bread for such a small piece of meat (another filler).  The sausage looks good, but tasted like cardboard filler inside,  I didn't like the texture, it didn't taste like a sausage. The meatball in the spaghetti tasted better than the sausage.  The meat lasagna was also good, but any pasta is again fillers.  Can't go bad with the Fried chicken, but the fried shrimp was more breading than shrimp.  As Chinese food is concern, I wouldn't touch it.  Looks and taste worst than Panda.   Mexican food, look like something from Del Taco, the Carnitas looks extremely fat and greasy.  Too many good and cheap Mexican restaurant in the area to want to go here for mexican foods.  Same with Chinese food too. Not into salad, if I wanted rabbit food, I would go to Soup Plantation down the street, its cheaper.   Drinks is expensive as far as soda and selections.  Hometown you can get your own whenever and whatever you want.  Here's it is more limited.  After your initial selection, your waiter/waitress gets your refills.  They are always around but it harder to change your mind since you don't see the machines and the selections. Dessert is not bad, cookies, cakes, chocolate fountain, fruits, but unlike other buffets which general has only softserve ice cream, GC also serves real scooped ice cream which I prefer.  They also have cotton candy which the kids definitely love.  Would I go back? Yeah, probably once a year.  Its not our my list of favorites.  Just like Hometown.   Just keep your expectations low, and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I am disappointed because the quality control dude must have gotten laid off. Last couple of times the seafood salad was warm, no deviled eggs, and the pot roast was dry as a bone. I asked the girl behind the counter to at least spruce up the pot roast...she said they make it the night before and its been under heat lamp all day, so what do I expect...really??  I expect my $12 to feed me since its a buffet! Unfortunately, if the food is inedible I will walk away hungry and pull into McDonald's on the way home.   Please clean it up over there...it use to be really good!!! And I love the seniors packing it in at before 3:59!!! It assures me food rotation! That's why it's always been so good over there because the food was always fresh!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love it here! The food is great the people are nice, and the food is somewhat great. Sometimes the food isn't always right but overall it is such a great place to spend with family"}
{"text":"Okay so, the food is passable and you will leave with a full belly, and if you approach the buffet with an appetite the check will seem worth the cost.  However, the staff looks like they were recently released from prison, and the place smells like a corpse is rotting in the air conditioner ducts! Still better than Il Forno Italian bistro by a long shot. Where you leave still hungry and feeling guilty about blowing $16.00 on a plate of SpaghettiOs."}
{"text":"OMG. Hands down to today's steak chef. Excellent tenderness, juicieness (if there was such word)"}
{"text":"Ok. I've loved Golden Corral forever but this one here just brought all my hopes down. It was insanely packed. Tons of people come here after church and you better be prepared to wait. We paid $41 for 2 adults and 2 children so we thought we better get our foods worth. My husband thought the sodas tasted watered down. If you need condiments the server will help you with that... Luckily.  I got a plate with meatloaf, Mac n cheese, cabbage, mashed potatoes and cornbread and was ok. Had to add some salt pepper and ketchup for meatloaf. Desserts was slim... I thought they would have more desserts. The kids didn't like the ice cream but the loved the chocolate fountain. I also went to the fruit and salad section and was bummed there wasn't more fruit. Only sliced oranges and melon was available. Skip the sesame chicken. It was waaaaaay salty."}
{"text":"I recently visited Golden corral 2641 in Las Vegas Nevada for breakfast with Dad.The place was nice and clean however the  customer service was horrible. I was ignored several minutes while standing at the  omelette station by the employee  Eva that was in charge of it . The Manager (Tomas) was also behind the counter  so I asked him, did they make fresh eggs? He replied yes, so I stood there waiting patiently for Eva to ask me what I would like . The entire time of me standing there, she never looked up and gave me any eye contact even after me trying to say good morning and addressing her by name. The next thing I know another employee whom I assume was on their lunch break walked up to the counter. She immediately acknowledged him, start speaking in Spanish and started making  his omelette. Still giving her the benefit of the doubt. I thought maybe she didn't see me so I stood directly beside him. She completed his omelette gave it to him and turned around and walked away.  At this point I realize I was being blatantly ignored, so I turned to look for the manager that I initially saw behind the counter. Before I could say one word  planning just to ask him if Eva spoke English he goes into a rant saying \"we're working here ,working here\" This is a new promotion...I guess referring to the omelette station that I didn't had no idea was new or old . I was in such shock the next thing he said to me was so what kind of eggs do you want? At that point my appetite was ruined I felt disrespected. I looked for my dad who was just about to sit down to eat his food and told him to leave it. Then asked the manager immediately for refund. After realizing his mistake he tried to apologize but was too late. I then name and he just gave me a card with no response I asked his name again and then he blurted out \"Tomas\" this is no was to handle A Dissatisfied customer. The problem would've easily been resolved had he said the station was not open, when I asked him did they make fresh eggs. Eva or Tomas could've simply said the station wasn't ready."}
{"text":"LOVE THAT THEY ARE BACK!  Great place with awesome food.  The staff is great and pay attention to details.  ALL YOU CAN EAT STEAK how can it be any better?  Great prices 2 adults and 2 kids eat for under $40.....AWESOME.  Only drawback is there are long lines, BUT SO WORTH THE WAIT."}
{"text":"The Food really starting to get better, And that chef on the grill with the glasses is amazing best thing going ever since I been coming to golden corral , his presentation for his food, and them steaks speechless keep up the Good work#proud customer"}
{"text":"THE GOOD: - AYCE for a cheap price - lots of different desserts! (ice cream, soft serve, cotton candy, pastries, cookies, fruits, chocolate fountain)  - Staff is nice  THE BAD: - LONG LINES. OMG.  - The food is just okay. Don't come here expecting some gourmet stuff. - Dude working the grill is such a NOOB!!!!!!!! Kept burning steaks, and doesn't know how to cut meat. You can't have someone who's terribly inefficient working the most popular part of the place!!!!!!!! - Their chinese food makes Panda Express suited for royal emperors"}
{"text":"It's not what I had in mind. The food was pretty disappointing, didn't look so appetizing. The dessert wasn't even pleasing. I pretty much picked on all my plates. Although I will say our server Pablo was quite the charmer and made the visit pleasant. Overall not worth the sixteen bucks."}
{"text":"Food was great and our waiter was the best I have had in a long time!  Ask for Arcadio when you come here, he was great!"}
{"text":"Stopped here after church with my 4 little ones. I paid and got our drinks no problem. Everyone got their first plates of food and we sat down to eat. My youngest son started fussing and out of no where threw up. I was trying to clean up what I could (heres where it goes very badly). \"Waitress\" was notified of what happened, she not once offered to move the people around us (there was puke on the floor). In fact she said well someone will come clean it up. I was trying to get the kids out the door. As we got to the front I ask a girl to get me a manager. I wanted to let them know so that the people could move (it's carpet, not quick easy clean up). I explain what happened and to my shock he says \"We'll I'm not cleaning it up it's your responsibility\". Not concerned about the others eating or my son. I said well it's on the floor and people are trying to eat and we didn't eat anything.  Not once did this MANAGER offer anything but rude and snarky comments! I won't be going back to this place anytime soon!"}
{"text":"It was a wonderful day.when l arrived at golden corral, l smelt all kind of food. I love that place because of the different kind of food. I had shrimps, fish, hushpuppies. They are people friendly. I just enjoyed myself."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time today with my Dad. I had been to similar buffets before and wasn't expecting much. Some of the items were great...some, not so much. My Dad had a piece of bacon that he thought was spoiled. I was trying to decide between the sirloin and prime rib. Tried the prime rib. Mistake! It was the driest and toughest prime rib ever. So, I went back for a piece of sirloin, and it was heavenly. The dinner rolls were a little chewy but the salad fixings were fresh. Tons of desserts to choose from. My Dad had carrot cake and was very happy with that, saying it was flavorful and moist. I opted for the macaroons dipped in the chocolate fountain. All in all, it wasn't bad. If you come hungry, you feel like you got your money's worth. But, if you come wanting some really delicious food, it's hit or miss."}
{"text":"Food was okay, but the steak was a little too dry and undercooked. My waitress was very rude and would attempt to get my boyfriend an I to sing a birthday song to her. Who does that? Very busy and staff was impolite. I don't recommend coming here if you are looking for good steak and friendly service. (Cotton candy was good, though!)"}
{"text":"Entering the restaurant, you are greeeted warmly. Once seated, you are almost immediately forgotten. We have to go up the front counter to get refills. Our table fills with plates as the waitress walks past. The food is hit or miss. Mostly over cooked or really bland. A few items are really good....the roast is awesome. The shrimp would be spectacular if it wasn't over cooked. The steak is Pretty good but somewhat gristly. None of it is worth $16 per person.  Our waitress tonight earned a $3 tip.  I came in with $10 to offer(20%). Good service =Good tip."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst Golden Corral I have ever been to-- and I've been to a lot. For $12.99 for dinner, I'd expect the buffet bars to be fully stocked and then replenished on a regular basis. I'd also expect staff to clean the bars regularly, especially of stray food that lands in another dish. Neither of these occurred.  The restaurant appeared sorely short-staffed, and those who do work here didn't appear particularly enthused about their work. Between the constant announcements of \"Code 200\" and \"Your children will be burned by the 165-degree bar if unaccompanied,\" it was an unbearable atmosphere. Go to a nice sit-down restaurant instead where you will certainly get a better value and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money on the filth. Disgusting and dirty and I personally watched food workers not wear gloves when working with food. Nasty"}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the staff was so friendly. The lines were pretty long but hey it's thanksgiving so I can't complain. I would definitely recommend this place to my friends and family."}
{"text":"Felt like cattle as we were forced to wait in a long line to get in, and even longer lines to get food.. All the servers and cashiers were very unfriendly, in a hurry to go to their own lunch breaks , and kept forgetting to bring the refills we asked for, not mention they never picked up all the piling plates on our table as well as the others around us. Even though they have more food selection than hometown buffet, it's not worth it for such shitty service and long lines.. And to top it off, we found hair in our foods twice on the same visit!!! Eeewww!!"}
{"text":"As long as a buffet has a variety of different foods, I would like to come in again and again. It's worth spending the money instead of Station Casinos in North Las Vegas."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try the Elyria Oh Golden Corral one more time after having a bad experience there before. Nothing has changed. Food cold. Shrimp on a skewer raw. Steak could be used for shoe leather.  Breaded chicken over cooked and dry. 15 people were waiting for the cook to give them steak when I asked for shrimp which the cook had to get some from the freezer to  grill.  One person cooking steak and shrimp. One piece of meat was supposed to be prime rib that had been sitting there  ten minutes while I was waited for some shrimp to get cooked which was still raw when I bit into one. Vegetables, mash potatoes cold.  The deserts are the only thing I would admit to that are good. How can you ruin cake. Cleanliness????? very bad. Food on the floor."}
{"text":"So we went to Golden Corral for lunch, fail. It was $24 for me and my husband and 1 drink, to me it wasn't worth it. The salad bar had no lettuce in it, the chicken was so salted that I couldn't even eat it and I'm the kind of person that even if I dont like it I will eat it anyway because I dont like to waste stuff. The macaroni and cheese was over cooked so it was pretty much just mush, the potatoes where good tho. Then I stood waiting for ice cream for 5 minutes0 because first they had nothing to put it in then the lady that was supposed to be getting it for me got distracted rolling dough, I finally got so fed up with the people wanting to socialize with each other more than wanting to work that I just walked off. And the poor guy that was supposed ot be \"taking care\" of our table was so lost and confused we asked for refills of our drinks and he took them all one by one instead of taking 2 at a time so he wouldn't have to make so many trips. It was like when they opened they gave a uniform to whom ever walked in and said \"you're hired!\" They had everything any regular buffet would of had except for the chocolate foutains, which I didnt use either. So, in conclusion, over priced, pathetic service and not worth the drive all the way over there."}
{"text":"This particular location is filthy,disgusting and horrible. If you don't mind these things you'll have a great time."}
{"text":"I have been to this location many times in the past, and it is usually pretty good. My son and I visited on a Friday night at 7pm on 11/30/2012. The line to get in was not too long, but it took almost 20 minutes to get through because everyone had to wait to be seated. Eventually we were shown to a seat by the manager.   First off, the place was absolutely filthy! Food, silverware and napkins littered the floor everywhere.  As I looked around, every table is my section had tons of plates stacked all over them. It was obvious that there was no server taking care of them.   A good majority of the food items were out every time I went up to the buffet. What was there had been picked over pretty good, with just small pieces or crumbs left behind. What I did manage to find was pretty good though, as the food here usually is decent.  We were there for nearly an hour, and never once did anyone come over to check on us or refill our drinks. Like every other table, ours had stacks of dirty plates that no one bothered to collect.  As we were leaving, I pulled the manager aside and told him of our experience. He simply stared blankly at me. I told him that perhaps he should be running the restaurant instead of seating people on such a busy night. Again, no response.  I may try them again in the future, but definitely not on a busy night, it seems that they can't handle being busy."}
{"text":"Love the smiley faces at the entrance. Also the food variety. If you had to choose foods between this and Old Country I'd go with this. Both good though. LOVED the desert placr and the chocolate fountain."}
{"text":"Gluttony gone wild,will not be going back EVER!  Carpet in the Buffet room....really?Dirty dishes,piles of food on plates,overworked food servers(that poor woman,I thought she was going to have a heart attck she was working so hard)serving ,cleaning ,making tea and washing the dishes ,Good Greif! First time there and no one even pretended like they cared if we knew where to sit or get drinks or anything ,poor experience."}
{"text":"I wrote to The Website over the Presidents Day weekend to report that it had erroneously dumped the City of Industry location's reviews onto the newly opened Las Vegas branch's page, and then deleted the Industry location from its business listings. http://www.yelp.com/biz/golden-corral-las-vegas-3#hrid:Ry3JAbjA2qRYVNY6jB7jhg  As it now stands, the Lamb Boulevard GC that opened two months ago (Dec. 19) has 362 reviews under its belt--just one actually written about that restaurant--and an established, vital business at 17635 Castleton St., Industry, went \"poof.\" http://www.reviewjournal.com/business/golden-corral-opening-las-vegas-207-new-workers  The following Tuesday, the page was revived, and at this writing has two reviews, total.  LVGC, the real one, has its own page (you're on it now)--the heading's only difference is that it contains a phone number--with 38 reviews.  Incredibly, what might have caused the original error was a picture posted on 4/22/12 of GC Industry, somehow slugged \"Golden Corral, Las Vegas, NV,\" unaccompanied by a review.  I'm guessing some Dudley Do-Right, Capt. Peter \"Wrongway\" Peachfuzz or a logarithm, decided to straighten things out.   I'm not asking for votes or comps here.  I want you sit down in your chairs, power up your online devices, open the window, stick your head out--flag this review--and yell, and say:  \"I'M FED UP AS HECK, AND I CAN'T STOMACH THIS ANY MORE!\""}
{"text":"The food was great prices are reasonable,  however; there is no order to the line waiting out the door the closer you get to the front the longer the line becomes,  because groups of 5 seem to multiply to groups of 15 to 20.. No joke. Sorry people but if your party isn't all there you shouldn't be allowed to have them keep cutting infront of everybody else! Plus watch your kids people, seriously, dirty fingers touching everything and running under people's feet not cool!"}
{"text":"Always a great experience eating at Golden Corral the food is always fresh hot & delicious place food , always impeccably clean staff is wonderful especially the manager"}
{"text":"FOOD POISONING. Ate the bourbon Chicken and an Iced Tea.   I was visiting my hometown (Cleveland), and my group decided to go here.   I told them that it was not a clean buffet.  I tried to give this restaurant a second chance.  Next morning, horrible food poisoning symptoms.    The silverware and plates are not clean and the cups have dried up food particles stuck to the inside of them.  The price was 11.99 (May 2014).  The server was excellent.  They were open on Memorial Day.  Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"This specific restaurant was horrendous. They didn't have a lot of food choices. The floor and food counters were dirty. I love the one out in Robinson and never been disappointed. We came to this location because it was near the emergency vet hospital. I will never, ever, ever come to this one again. Please be warned!"}
{"text":"Always great food! Always packed, reminds me of good 'ole Furrs days! You'll remember that place if you've been in Vegas long enough!   Valentina is my favorite server here, she's sooo attentive & sweet!"}
{"text":"This should of been a ZERO for the person seating guests on 04/14/17 @6:35PM. JERRY is his name and I highly suggest he gets more training perhaps in customer service. Rude and disrespectful at its finest! I simply asked if there was any closer seating by the food area since my mother inlaw uses a walker. His reply \"What do you want to do? You either sit on that side, or the other side!\" seriously?!!!! **JERRY YOU SUCK!"}
{"text":"Word of advise, do not go there on the weekend unless u like waiting outside in line in the sun for at least an hour.  The line stretches back to the parking lot.  They even have these water mist sprayers so you can cool off while you wait.  Line kind of reminds me of being in an amusement park (Disneyland, Six Flags).   There is only one other nearby location in all LA/IE/OC area in Hesperia so I can see why this place gets packed like sardines.   Place is packed with people and is a zoo.  Other than that they have a variety of different food. I personally digged the boneless buffalo wings, they taste like the ones from Chillis."}
{"text":"This place is horrible, they need to clean up me and my younger brother got food poison I'll never go back."}
{"text":"Not a fan of buffets, but chose to eat here because it was my father's favorite place.  Noticed that none of the cooks were wearing hair restraints.  That's a terrible practice for food service."}
{"text":"First time here at golden corral. My bf was excited to come here but was a complete disappointment. The bill was 40, i get it it's a buffet no big deal but the food and service was awful. Our waiter didn't bring us refills or pre buss our table and the food was dry. definitely not coming here again and it certainly was not worth 40$."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday afternoon and the buffet was wiped out of all of their breakfast and salad selections did not see any employees trying to keep it stocked other than the cooks trying to keep up at the carving station dessert selection was very empty as well"}
{"text":"About what you'd expect from an all you can eat buffet. But, as mentioned in other reviews, the steak guy was obnoxious enough for us never to return to this location."}
{"text":"It's been nearly a decade since I was in a Golden Corral.  I was happy to hear of the first opening in the Vegas Valley.  First off... The have one of the largest selection of any buffet in the area.  We went on a Monday which is their Shrimp and Seafood special day.  They had 6 different fish dishes in addition to the usual buffet favorites.  But SURPRISE they also offer grilled to order sirloin steaks!  Prices are a might higher than usual with adults at $11.89. Seniors over 60 at $10.99 (Seniors Monday thru Friday 1 pm to 3 on are $7.49).  If you have kids, Tuesdays are for you.  Kids on Tuesday are just $2.99!  So.. If you are looking for a different place to go... check out Golden Corral.  I can't end a review without mentioning our server.  Meghan was right there answering questions, clearing the 'debris' of our feeding frenzy, or just checking on us... always with a smile.  THANKS MEGHAN!"}
{"text":"we have been waiting an extremely long time for Golden Corral to arrive in Las Vegas it has been open for a few months now and we finally got a chance to go across town and visit when we got there line was outside of the door and into the parking lot it took us a full 30 minutes to get through the line into the building and then from the front door to the cashier took us another 20 minutes     excluding how busy it was and how behind they were the food was extremely fresh and amazing it was well worth the wait and one of the biggest and most delicious dessert counters I've ever seen and I have lived in Las Vegas my whole life"}
{"text":"I love this buffet. They have lots of great food. The food is really really good and they have a very wide variety to chose from. They also have many great deserts. The only thing I wasn't too happy about was the price because it is a bit pricey and they don't offer any type of promotions or coupons."}
{"text":"My family and I go to Golden Corral every Sunday after church. I saw the commercial for the lobster add on and my son and I wanted to try it. Wow!  Not only was it a great value it was also delicious.  We can't wait until next week so we can have lobster again."}
{"text":"They have literally EVERYTHING like every single thing I craved they had! Brocoli cheddar soup, shrimp, grilled cheese! Everything, EVEN COOKIES & CREAM ice cream. Waiter was consistent! Loved it here!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Long line, decent food. Highlight of the buffet is definitely their chocolate fountain and cotton candy machine. Also, they have really nice waiters.   If the line wasn't so long, I would come back. It's not worth the wait though."}
{"text":"Wonder Service The lady working behind the Bakery was wonderful Beautiful Smile and very Pleasant Her name was Marion"}
{"text":"So very crowded. This is my first time at an American buffet. Food selection is good. Good steak."}
{"text":"I love this place so much go here all the time with my family after a basketball game or if we are celebrating something. The things i like about it is they have all kinds of good foods and their drinks are good. The servers sometimes may not be the best but most of the time i go they are on point when they see a empty cup they will go and fill it quick. They always come up ask how we are doing and its just great!!  When you walk into the restaurant you really feel welcomed they have a little arcade for the kids when the lines are long, They normally don't have you wait for a long time and they always seem to put me in the best seats. The bathrooms are clean and don't stink, when you walk out you cant get tooth picks just in case you might be there with a girl. The restaurant is usually clean food here and there but you definitely want to watch your step.   I think the best thing to get there is the steak, it's so juicy and good. But overall this is the best place to go when you are trying to impress or celebrate even just food. All the deserts are good they have a chocolate fountain and ice cream. The best thing about it is theirs no limit so keep going until your full easy as that."}
{"text":"First off the staff here are amazing and surprisingly patient.  They definitely get four stars. They answered questions and did the best they could to accomdate our group during the dinner rush.  However, the food wasn't that appetizing and the bathroom was pretty disgusting. I don't think I will be repeating this dining experience."}
{"text":"WOW!! cold food the wings was ice cold the steak was like rubber.  Wish now I took my family some where else.  Most items was out or looked old.  I love chicken livers but those was burnt and hard are rocks the dessert stuff was picked though and the bread was not all the way cooked."}
{"text":"This place is a mad house BUT the food is better than decent and they have a large variety. Everything seems to be made fresh in house and the service people are responsive."}
{"text":"My friends & family really enjoyed it in the beginning. Now what the hell 3 choclate fountains & no more jumbo fried shrimp? whats up instead providing good healthy food first then maybe little desert, now switch to fat sugary desert as their priority. We want good food not fat sugery dersert.. Thats bad business tried to save money on shrimp and switching with 3 OverWeight Fat Ass Fountains.. WHERE IS THE PRIME RIB? STOP SWITCHING FROM GOOD TO BAD!"}
{"text":"If you've been to a Vegas buffet this is nothing near it. First impression when I came in on a Tuesday night-- wow ghettttooooo! I've been to many buffets, but the food didn't look appetizing at all. I went for a plate and there were a piece of chocolate cake still stuck on it. Im not normally a germaphobe but that made me check twice on the cutlery. It was soooo busy and packed, it seemed like a refugee camps' cafeteria where people haven't eaten before.   Good:  - good variety for what u pay for - cotton candy - Chocolate fondue  Would I recommend waiting in a long ass line? No way. But again, good value for the money: steak (dry medium rare), ribs(dry), ham (dry), spinach n salad bar fresh. Dessert omg super sweet."}
{"text":"-The place smelled like homeless people (urine and dirty mop water)  -The cashier was rude (There was a group of 10 and we there were some stragglers, so one came in and told the lady he will be right back to pay he wanted to see if everyone was still eating. Well 2 minutes later the cashier walks to our area and yell across 15 tables \"Sir you need to come pay\")  That is poor customer service. She could have walked over to our table and told him that. When requested to see the manager she said it was protocol.   -There was a lot of children running around wild touching food and putting it back. They need to enforce parents to tend to their children when at the food bar.  WILL NEVER GO BACK!!"}
{"text":"we went last night for the first time, it was just okay.  the food was mediocre at best.  the only bright part of our dinner  was our server Sabrina.  She was friendly and attentive, always kept our drinks refreshed...we'll probably come back because we have boys and they thought it was great!"}
{"text":"First time here and it was ghetto!  People in line were so ghetto.  This little boy, about 8, was getting ice, spilled the ice cause he got too much and then got more ice.  What a waste and where was the parent?  Not watching him that's for sure.  FYI it wasn't an Asian kid.  Food was ok.  Killed my curiosity, will not come again due to the type of people who frequent here."}
{"text":"The food here is always hot, tasty, and lots of it.  My son loves the Pot Roast dinner, and my wife says the salad is always fresh with lots of great toppings and dressings.  I love the fresh made omelets on Sunday mornings. The steaks they serve are a real let down.  They are always tough, with too much fat and gristle on them.  But then this is not a steak house restaurant.  I've never had a bad experience with any of the servers,  and for the most part the bathrooms are always clean.  With the changing of food choices and new dishes, l most likely will stop back on occasion."}
{"text":"The food sucks too much it was very salty over  cooked and bad quality  ..the enviroment stinks ..very disappointed ..not reccomanded"}
{"text":"I love this place! The good was very good. A few of my favorites were the pot roast and the sweet potato casserole. Nice variety of meats and vegetables. They have chocolate cheese pie that is AMAZING!! Our server Alicia was the best. She was very attentive and super fast and friendly. I recommend this place for a great variety of food to chose from and great service. My husband and I enjoyed our experience there. Will definitely be returning"}
{"text":"I loved the Golden Corral in Lake Havasu City and would go a few times a week. After moving to Vegas I was excited to learn Golden Corral was opening here, and not far from my new home. So I went on the opening day - big mistake. The food was simply awful, the service was inept, the restaurant not properly laid out to handle a big crowd! Took me over an hour on line just to get to the cashier.   I waited about 2 months and went back for lunch. Time to get to the cashier was now reduced to 40 minutes, not much improvement in food or service.  After another 4 months I was ready to try again. No line whatsoever at noon - went right to cashier. Food quality is now average (a tremendous improvement), and while service was mostly inadequate I had one server who was quite good. With Vegas being a buffet city Golden Corral is more for locals - I think I can now safely recommend you won't be disappointed - as long as you don't have high expectations. The best part of Golden Corral is that you can choose to eat healthy here - salads, vegetables, etc.  If you want a better Golden Corral (of comparable size) experience, drive down to Lake Havasu City, where there's always an franchise owner on the job - schmoozing with the customers, overseeing operations, and making sure the food is hot, fresh and plentiful."}
{"text":"Place is decent came in about lunch time 1140-12pm not packed at all on a Monday  Food was decent I would recommend this place for people who like buffets it's clean and employees and cooks are nice and respectful"}
{"text":"Food is hit or miss. Good luck"}
{"text":"Me and my Wife wanted to try this place once, It was Too Crowded, food was Just OK not GRREAT just OK, well we wont be going back. Been there Done That."}
{"text":"Ridiculously long line for just an \"average\" buffet. Price was ok, food was nothing to brag about. Would not come back."}
{"text":"I already get my haircut at the Cuttin Coral....  Exactly as I expected..... Food was mediocre but edible.... I guess $11 is fair for what you get.  Couldn't believe I was behind a wedding party....hoodtastic !!"}
{"text":"This Place is a cross between Hometown &  soup plantation but with better food & much more choices & I like the food stations there very clean & hot and they serve you flame broiled steak just the way you like it, a salad bar twice the size of the others real ice cream a must try if you don't mind the space mountain type line to get in. How ever note to management the beverage counter at you entrance needs to go away if you can't keep it clean nobody is manning this station."}
{"text":"Don't expect the Bellagio buffet but for $7.49 for lunch not a bad deal. Decided to see what the hype was all about. I always see the long lines while driving on the 60 Frwy. I paid a visit on Tuesday afternoon, there was no line but busy inside. I was pleasantly surprised, for the amount paid I got a good deal. Golden Corral is not a Bellagio nor Rio Buffet but it doesn't cost $30 either..  I can't believe some of the reviews for the amount it costs I guess people were expecting the Caesars Palace buffet. The chocolate fountain w/strawberrys, cotton candy and real ice cream was a nice touch.  Give it a shot, it is better than Hometown. The server told me on Sat & Sun there is a 2 hour wait"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved it!!! Great food, great price, great everything!! The steak was to die for. The mashed potatoes were perfect. The deserts were delectable:) the staff was great too, very friendly. I recommend going there, and I will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"Went to the Corral for dinner. Two men(20 y.o.) were in the food area with there jeans down below their butt. One was walking around with his hand on his Johnson. Totally unacceptable for an eating establishment. I understand it is not against the law in Nevada but your establishment should watch for vulgar thing and ask them to conform or leave."}
{"text":"I am not happy at all with this place.....went to spend my money and celebrate my sons 10 th baday ...and in order to use bday coupon u hv to print...ok fine i understand....but then when i ask to hv them sing happy birthday to my son.....the waitress comes with a plate with happy birthday and a cupcake on it....and of course said here we made this we didnt hv time to sing! This was the worst experience ever there.....not including we did even get refills by the waitress  my sons went to the machines to refill for us! The only good thing was the cashier was friendly as well with the steak cook!"}
{"text":"Won't eat here ever again... in life. I'm not a huge fan of buffet dining as it is, but this just plain grossed me out.   The buffet didn't have as many offerings as I previously remembered. Additionally, there wasn't anything too spectacular about the taste/quality of the food.  After I brought my plate to the table, I noticed we had an uninvited guest. There was a roach crawling on the wall heading for our table. I went to speak to the manager and informed him of the situation. He stated, \"Was he dead or alive?\" I said \"alive and moving.\" He then said, \"Well, he should be dead. The exterminator just left two days ago.\" Needless to say I was done. I got my $$ back and left.   Dine at your own risk."}
{"text":"The typical adventure watching the hordes bellying up to the trough. The experience would be fine except for the other customers who had no regard for hygiene portion control or courtesy.  Served the purpose, got more than a full meal at a reasonable cost."}
{"text":"You have to have low standards and be the type of person who likes a filled and unpleasant cafeteria food environment to like this one .The one in st george is actually really good but this one was just disappointing,  for the price just go to a casino buffett instead."}
{"text":"I really like the food, there's so much to choose from.  The food is well prepared and alot of it, all you can eat.  The service is good also.  Go and see for yourself."}
{"text":"Not at all impressed...our server was not very happy to be there...food was very sub-par and it was way to crowded. Not the good kind I crowded where you feel like \"wow this is great it must be busy because the food is so great..\" But the type of crowded where you feel a fight may break out. Also, if the chocolate fountain is their golden gem...why is it ok for people to dip the strawberry,lick off the chocolate and re dip it right then and there...absolutely disgusting! I Waited almost 10 minutes to dip...saw that and was immediately turned away...just saying...Never again!"}
{"text":"needless to say I think they need a good manager for the past three visits the food was not that great I have been eating here for years about 7 or more I have always liked the food but this manager sucks. I have owned three restaurants that I sold and no they were doing great when I sold them I just got too old.  last time there the ribs were cold, nothing like cold lard to make you gag.  The chicken wings were nothing to write home about and most of them were not even put out. I was serving myself to some wings the manager grabs the tray from me so I had to wait on him for the ribs it was 10 past 4pm and he kept telling the cooks not put the ribs out until some of the lunch crowd left.  The other time he was entertaining some guys that seemed to be pushing drugs or something from the corner table but they kept going up to people and talking to the manager been there done that so I knew what they were doing.  Anywho the last few times just had the melon and soup this place has started to suck."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant during lunch time Sunday but the price is $12 per person. If drink is ordered together, it will be $14~15. It is very expensive. And we do feel strongly that it doesn't worth the price.  The fried chicken is typical southern soul food and they are supposed to be the expert of doing it but it is so dry and inedible. I am not the type of person who would waste food. I have no choice but to put it away. It is really bad.   Nothing is special in this restaurant. The food is so so. We will never go back again. I just don't know why the line is so long. It doesn't worth the wait. May be it is because this is the first Golden Coral restaurant opened in Southern California. People would want to try something new."}
{"text":"Food was great. However, the place was sooooo filthy. It's a pretty big turn off considering their business deals with food  The place is obviously did not have enough employees to keep the place clean.  Seeing how untidy the place is, you'd have second thoughts about trying the food. We were just famished that's why we did."}
{"text":"Thank you so much for the free veterans dinner today. Selection was amazing, food was great, service was outstanding. You made me feel very special. Means more than I can describe."}
{"text":"It's nothing but hype, not worth the wait, especially in the burning sun. It's hardly a \"buffet\" as you have to stand in line to be served the steak, etc.  Even when they serve you, they make sure you get the smallest piece, I guess people don't want to get in line again as saying it 's chaotic is an understatement!!   It's noisy, crowded, just not a pleasant dining experience.  I'm a regular customer of Hometown, but just wanted to see the difference, this place sucks!  The food was bland, desserts blah and the worst part of it is you can't refill your own drink. The food at HTB is far superior especially since Terry Golding took over as GM.  He makes us feel so welcome, the atmosphere is so friendly, we feel at home.  In talking to my friends who are regulars like me, they all said that they too had tried GC and once was more than enough.  I've been told that they're going to remodel and it's going to be even better, can't wait!"}
{"text":"I prefer this location to others in the valley.  Except for afternoon rush hour.  Dont go there between 3 and 6.  Unless youre a senior citizen, then its ok.  Youll fit right in.  I went for dinner and cant complain.  its your basic buffet, it seems like it has a larger selection than Ryans or JBs and the food quality is way better than both of those.  The brisket and beef tips were great, the only problem i had with the place was the wal mart environment (crying kids, way crowded, people acting like THAT steak was the last one ever made, etc) and i did make the mistake of going during grandma social hour, but aside from that, ill go back when Im craving 10 different things at once, which happens often :)  Dinner buffet for 2 runs a little under 30 bucks with drinks."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to eat here for over a month.  Everytime I would go, the line was out the door, so I'd pass. Finally got to eat there today.  When entering, it can be a little confusing because they have seats right near the door.  There was a group there, but they were waiting for more people and told me and my mother to go ahead of them.  I've never seen this before, but you get your drink while you are in line.......before you pay.  Thought that was odd.  We were looking for somewhere to sit.  The downfall for them is they were not clearing off the tables fast enough.  There were so many tables that needed to be cleared off.  After a while, I guess the evening shift checked in and they got to work on the tables.  So many selections for food.  The food that I picked was good, seasoned very well.  During dinner hours, I can understand how it would get so confusing & congested with the lines.  I also noticed they had an allergy alert sign for people who are allergic to nuts.  That was good because that applies to me.  I find I always have to ask when it comes to certain foods.  All in all, it was a good outing.  Just have to be aware of what time of the day to go.  Don't think I'll be trying it on the weekend.  But, it's worth checking out."}
{"text":"Horrible place. Very dirty, cold food, food was not cooked well. I love golden corral but this restaurant was the worst I've ever been in ever."}
{"text":"So I'm at Golden Corral right now , thee moment I walk in , my first impressions were that it looked ghetto . Thee ppl that were eating there , thee location it's in . It's absolutely disgusting . And to top it off , I watched a guy standing at thee food just eating straight from thee trays instead of putting it on a plate ! And there was some white shit inside of thee cocktail sauce ! Gross ! It's safe to say I will NEVER be coming back here again . Even thee most ghetto of buffets were better than this . I had expectations . This was horrible ."}
{"text":"My grandkids and I love the way the staff changes the food trays and keeps foods fresh and I love the prime rib.  I love all there foods  5 stars and for the price"}
{"text":"If you want to eat and just be full and not have too much expectations and pay only $12 for lunch, Golden Corral is the place for you. The price is great but the food was mediocre. The fried/butterfly shrimp was so small it was mostly battered shirmp. Mash potatoes were good, asian food there wasn't so great. The pot roast was dry.  Overall....just come here to be full but if you expect something better than Hometown Buffet....LEAVE!"}
{"text":"Food not very good but people are nice. Some woman threw up on my wife's shoe while in line."}
{"text":"I find the food flavorless. Dirty eating utensils. My cup was dirty and the second cup was also dirty so I was grossed out and I just asked for a disposable children's cup. Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been wanting to go here but every time we drive by there is a long line going out the door and around the corner. We finally decided to come on a Wednesday and sure there was no line going out the door but we still had to wait about 30 mins to be seated. Finally, we were seated and started filling up our plates.  The food was definitely better than Home Town Buffet but not what I call GREAT. With all the hype, we had high expectations like many other people.  Overall the food was good and the dessert selection was good too. We would come here again.  I forgot to mention that they need to keep up with the food demand bc a few times we tried getting up to go get some of the stuff we haven't tried and every time we went the platters were empty, so we gave up and just had repeats."}
{"text":"So i finally gave in to the hype and decided to wait in line for this place on a Friday evening (probably one of the worst times to come). I ended up waiting an hour and by the time i got to the food i was starving. I tried a good amount of the food and to be honest this was extremely disappointing. The food here was very sub par and certainly does not justify the ridiculous wait time. Food was either bland, salty, or not cooked properly. I do give them credit for having great service, but unfortunately i came in for the food...not the waiters."}
{"text":"Four stars?!  Seriously - FOUR stars?!    I'm beginning to wonder about some of the people, who post reviews on Yelp.  I admit to often being a pretentious horse's ass, who thinks he's better than most people and says it out loud.  Golden Corral offers you lots of substandard food at reasonable --- not great:  reasonable --- prices and that's about all there is to say.  You won't find any of the chefs, who cook here to have passed audition for Hell's Kitchen or Master Chef  (though Chef Ramsey MIGHT have allowed them to clean his restaurants' bathrooms).  This is not to fault them or other people, who work at this location in Goodyear:  they're attentive, friendly, quick to serve and overall excellent employees.  But the food is just nasssssty.  Not \"nasty\":  nassssssty.  If you meet someone on a date you think you might want to get to know better and they say they like this place, it's time for you to hit Craigslist again.  Most of the food here is oversalted and of questionable quality.  Enough grease is produced in this place to qualify it as an automotive lube center during off hours.  And thank God Morton's Salt has found a place in the Valley to unload its excess salt packages ... unfortunately, the packages have been pre-opened and dumped in anything which might look like food.  I'm sorry, but when workers from Domino's and Waffle House laugh at a place, you know there's something seriously wrong; hit Black Bear Diner up the road instead"}
{"text":"I hate buffets! But this is beyond a buffet!!!! They make food fresh, so its never just sitting around. Steak and seafood cooked in front of you. Staff constantly walking around so no kid has the option to even attempt touching items with their fingers.   Staff is friendly. Restaurant is clean. Great selection of food!"}
{"text":"If I could write a review with NEGATIVE STARS I would. We went here to celebrate a couple of family birthdays here on July 10th , 2015 .This place is now Dirty and the food is DISGUSTING!!!! This Golden Corral used to be a clean and wonderful place to enjoy delicious, fresh food. But unfortunately it is dirty and the food is dry, processed  and salty. It is NOT WORTH the money at all!!!!! They let children run amuk and touch and lick the food and the ice cream machines. They do not insist that children be accompanied up to the buffet with an adult. Not that the adults there act any better. It is a shame. We used to celebrate our happy occasions here But we are never going there again!!!!! Save your money and your appetite. The Golden Corral on Brookpark Rd. should be closed!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment...there was NO MELTED cheese for the tacos...you gotta have the cheese... there wasn't many choices for food..but the dessert was the bomb.com...it wasn't worth my money at all!! I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"After reading several not so nice reviews, I kept putting off eating here. Until one day when I decided what the heck, let's try it. And boy am I glad I did! This place is actually really good! People who judge it too harshly probably shouldn't be eating buffet style then. I love eating at buffets with my little kids because they can graze and try new things without it breaking the bank. The food was fresh, REAL, and the place was fairly clean for how many people go through there. And the coolest part?! The DESSERT bar! They have a chocolate fountain, cotton candy (yes like fair style!) pies, etc. I was very happy with the service and the prices. All in all, great place for the price and food being served!"}
{"text":"Good food for a good price. The high chairs aren't the greatest. Happy to finally have a Golden Corral in vegas :)"}
{"text":"The food here is never hot unless you get it fresh off the grill which will be overcooked or raw.  Everytime I eat here whether it is breakfast, lunch, or dinner I am stuck in the bathroom for hours.  I will never eat here again.  I wish the State board of Health would check into this place"}
{"text":"First time here with the family for a birthday, wasn't expecting too much considering its a buffet. Service could've been better, our server only served us one at a time for drinks (I was left alone completely) but it was busy so a tad bit understandable. Food was sub par but again it's a buffet so what can you do. Would only recommened if you're not picky about not receiving quality service or food."}
{"text":"Like many of you, I was initially turned off to trying this place out because of the ridiculous line that stretches out to the parking lot. FYI that line continues once you reach the inside of the establishment for another 15 minutes at peak hours.  So what's this place have? All sorts of meat. They also have a salad section, but the workers there look pretty lonely because who craves salad at a meat buffet? The dessert section is also pretty nice. I appreciated the scoop of mint and chip ice cream, and many people partake in the cotton candy post meal.   Getting down to the nitty gritty: I'm a rib guy, but the ribs were just average here. When an entree is great, you are already planning on getting your next portion while eating your current portion. No such feelings here.   The steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at GC. One thing about the steak though:    I don't know if the steak chef is color blind, or if he simply does not give a flying caboodle. On three different occasions I asked for well done or medium well, and all three times I got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate. I could swear my plate was mooing back at me.  Also, if you aren't familiar with buffet culture...the clientele can be a little eccentric. If you generally don't see strange people in public, that's because they are all here at GC.   Yes the quality was better than Hometown. No the quality was not better than a Vegas buffet/Morongo buffet. For the price of entry, I'd say you come out a little bit ahead if you plan your meal right. I'm not a buffet fan, so I'd come here 1-2 times a year maximum."}
{"text":"How do I begin...  Amazingly overcrowded, loud, sketchy clientele, rude and flustered employees.....     Food is bottom of the barrel and when the place is crowded, darn near impossible to get anything  except the very bottom of the pan, which is almost inedible.      The only thing positive was I got a cooked to order steak- rare- that wasn't half-bad.   I wish I could score it higher, but, no.   I was an overall nightmarish experience."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about this place and decided to take a visit with my boyfriend. The price is good but the food... I honestly think Hometown Buffet across the street is better.   I don't think I would wait in line that long to eat here again. Maybe if the lines were shorter and I had no idea where to go eat, I'll come back.  Nothing really special about this place, except for the cotton candy."}
{"text":"I'll be the first to admit I was not expecting much from this place. I was wrong, I am surprised how really good it was. The steak was very very good, it was tender well seasoned and perfectly cooked and when I say perfect I mean it. I asked for 'medium rare' and the cook looked over the 10 or so steaks he had cooking and snapped one up and said \"here ya go, medium rare'  and sure enough it was.  The creamed spinach and sautéed mushrooms went well with the steak and were delicious as were the mashed potatoes and dark gravy. Our server was right on top of things clearing off plates and refilling the drinks. The one thing that I didn't like was making my way through the crowds and around the kids without spilling my plate. But I what could I say it is a buffet after all.  I saw other reviews that talked about cold food and rude people, I'm happy to say that was not my experience and I'd happily go back any time."}
{"text":"If you want to feel like you are in a prison cafeteria, then come here. If you want to get diabetes or a heart attack, then come here. It is the most depressing environment and the quality of the food is terrible."}
{"text":"We went there for Thanksgiving and you had three choices of how you wanted your food over cooked under cooked or not cooked right. $12.99 for all you can eat  isn't bad at all. If you just want to eat their dessert even that had no taste at all. Save some money go to McDonalds instead that place is pure crap. Way over packed and too many kids put their fingers and all the desserts very poor management"}
{"text":"Let's say all the hype of the line is not worth the food and the small atmosphere as well as the cramped seating area it is not worth the time at all. Save the money and go somewhere else"}
{"text":"Very good food and nice staff. Good selection of salads and main dishes, side dishes and desserts. One of the few places around here with a good salad bar. Reasonably priced. HOWEVER...happened to look up today and noticed the ceiling fans, overhead pipes and beams are so gross dusty I'm afraid crud will fall in my food. This place really needs to hire some heavy duty cleaning crew to rectify this current issue and then keep up with it! I'll go back when that happens."}
{"text":"My favorite buffet in Arizona! my family and i go here on thanksgiving when we don't feel like cooking and i recently went here for my birthday! they have a full buffet with steak, pot roast and chicken. their desert bar is awesome. I only wish they did birthday discounts"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time with my Girlfriend last night for the sake of trying the place out since I'm generally a buffet whore, and I see the Golden Corral commercials on television all the time so I just had to partake, and see what the big fuss was all about.  Right when I came in, I was pumped, everything looked brightly lit, enticing and delicious.  There were so many stations ranging from breads, to ethnic foods and even a grill station with fresh steaks.  Reason is I was so stoked and amazed when doing a quick survey of what was available was probably because I was comparing it to Hometown Buffet, of which I am a regular patron, and the selection here was certain more extensive.  All I can say is that even though there was a lot of variety, no one thing really blew me away.  Things that stood out was the carved Turkey, Calm chowder, fried Catfish, Bourbon chicken and the steak, which was a hit and miss cause it was usually over cooked and tough.  Other than that, everything was pretty average, but what do you expect for $11.99 a person?  If there was one near me, and I was in a I don't care what I eat mood, I may go pay them my patronage from time to time, but unfortunately there isn't one around me so Hometown Buffet and the regular run of the mill Asia/Chinese will suffice for the time being."}
{"text":"My 6yr old loved it , we went for an early dinner Sunday night. The food was fresh lots of selections. It was nice to see the food being cooked and replenished as needed.  My 6 yr when we first sat down said he was going to eat all his dinner just so he could have cotton candy he was disappointed when he was told the machine was broken. I had a taco salad and was suprised at how tasty the meat was unlike other buffets I have been to. Good place when you want to please the child in your life on occasion."}
{"text":"Seriously?!?!?  This place is revolting.    They have lots of items.  I say items because very few of them look like anything that resembles legitimate food.    Having gone here with some family friends one night, my boyfriend and I paid at the front. (umm.. $25 for a buffet-could go to an actual restaurant and pay a couple bucks more and get real food with a real server... but i digress) We paid and were told to wait in line to be seated (what is this Disneyland.. why am I waiting in line at a buffet?) We were sat in the \"dining area\" it was awkwardly close to the food area, so it was a little sketchy for me to put my purse anywhere besides between my feet.  The food, like I said earlier, there are a lot of item options.  90% of which are overcooked, under seasoned, or just plain unidentifiable.  Overall, we left feeling ripped off and still hungry.  What a waste of calories.  Now mind you, I must note that I am not against the buffet.  I have been to some over the years that have mastered the concept well.  Golden Corral, despite their creative yet obnoxious television ads-has not!"}
{"text":"I really wish I could give this place less than one star. It is terrible. The breakfast buffet was sub par to say the least. There really wasn't one thing I tried that tasted like actual food. Not once did anyone refill my drink or take the plates off our table. I recommend anywhere but here."}
{"text":"Please disregard my review if you're perfectly OK with all-you-can-eat crappy food, because I know that some people are.   The service is fine, our drinks were always full, and the cashier was friendly.   I had heard so much hype about them opening in Vegas that I was honestly looking forward to trying this location out. There selection was not as big as I expected, and what really bothered us was the fact that 1/3rd of the food had NO label.   The best food I had was the steak. You see them grilling It right there and they ask how you want it done. All of the other food was pretty bland. Except the cotton candy, it's hard to have nasty cotton candy ;)"}
{"text":"Positive, the waitress was very polite and always asked if we needed anything. If I was reviewing her the place would get 5 stars.   Negative, me, my wife and 2 kids came for dinner on a Friday at 5:30.  The place was under staffed, half the food items were missing and a staff person was working on the chocolate fountain with bare hands touching the chocolate.  It should of been taken apart and sanitized.  My 8 year old wanted an ice cream cone but it was empty at 5:45pm on Friday.  This place is starting to resemble a lot of the ponderosa restaurants before they went out of business. If the golden Coral in Macedonia Ohio doesn't change it will be out of business soon. I'm not going back."}
{"text":"Husband and I had Sunday dinner here on 5/6/18..The food wasn't as good as it was when they first opened & be prepared to get rolled eyes and an attitude when you ask for a well done steak from the female chef... Very unprofessional and rude"}
{"text":"I don't understand why so many people go to this place... about 18.50 for 2 Saturday breakfast..without drinks    the food is worse than the nearest hometown buffet (half mile away)  i mean food is not THAT bad...is edible but...18.50 for 2 ...breakfast ?  this thing feel like one of those 4.99 buffets in las vegas    I don't understand......every buffet I went to is better than this s..t"}
{"text":"Well I know why the parking lot was pretty empty. The price of a dinner now is $14.99 per person. This is ridiculous. It wasn't even worth that price. The only thing that made it worthwhile was the nice man who was our waiter. I can think of a lot of other places to eat at."}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving them a star is because some of the food tasted good. The honey sesame chicken was hard to eat, the carrot cake wasn't that good, & not to mention, the atmosphere was horrible. They closed at 9:30, and we got there at about 8:30. An hour until they close, and they were already trying to close. My boyfriend and I had constant eyes on us, as if they were just waiting for us to leave. Every few minutes a guy in a blue shirt would \"nonchalantly\" walk past the dining room we were in, and every time I would make eye contact with him. He looked like a manager. There was a younger girl server there too that was yelling across the dining room about some drama going on. At almost $15 a person, I would expect a more comfortable, relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"Okay so first time here now the food is great well not all of it the hand dipped ice cream is more hand dipped milkshake the chicken is not fully cooked the customer service is horrible the guy who rings people up has an attitude to everyone who walks in the buffet he lacks hospitality, the waitresses dont smile or acknowldege you when you arrive to your table since you sit yourselfves no1 said hi to me at all not even welcome to golden corral so for the first vegas and neveda location its 1 star they make money $$$$$ but they dont make that happy memorable service."}
{"text":"This is my boyfriend's family favorite breakfast place. I know it's a buffet but that means...CHOICES!  We are here almost every Sunday for breakfast (sometimes early dinner) with the family. Ron, who is our main go to server that we always to get, does excellent service.  They have so many choices, especially the evening, with steak, ham, pasta, chicken, salad bar, taco bar, etc.  We came here on Thanksgiving and it was PACKED. We waited a long time but it was worth it. We had 16 people and surprisingly, we were seated within 5 mins (well thanks to a big group of 16 leaving :P). They had your whole Thanksgiving dinner right there and you didn't have to make it at home.  Anyway, we will be back, probably next Sunday. Check this place out."}
{"text":"What in the world?  I felt like I was waiting for a ride at Disneyland with the long and ridiculous line.  Leonard W and I always see commercials for Golden Corral and even thought about stopping by Victorville next time we head to Vegas, but what do you know, a Golden Corral opens in 626!  We got there around 11:20am and we were greeted with this loooong line out the door.  Turns out this place also serves breakfast so there's a crowd since morning.  The outside portion took a good 20 minutes before we got into the door, thinking that we are getting closer to food, but reality slaps us in the face and the line actually curls a few times like at Disneyland before you head towards the register to pay!  Finally, after a total of 40-50minutes of waiting, we were seated and we began to explore the buffet.  There's a salad station, Mexican, Chinese, Southern, grill station, small seafood section, and a big dessert section.  The standouts for us was definitely the Mandarin Chicken and the fried chicken!  We loved the Mandarin Chicken because it isn't drenched in sauce and they actually stir fry it with Chinese fermented black soybeans!  It adds a different flavor to your normal orange chicken and we ate a ton of those.    Now, the fried chicken was ridiculously juicy.  Good seasoning on the outside and we thought that only the dark meat was gonna be juicy, but even the breast meat was awesome.  After those two items though, we didn't care too much about the others.  They had pork chops for lunch instead of sirloin steaks.  They also had sliders but a little inconsistent.  Our first sliders were great, but sliders after were all overcooked.  Pizzas, pot roast, chicken fajita, cajun fish, and fried catfish were a few items that I tried and they were all alright.  The weirdest thing on the menu was fried chicken gizzards.  That was... interesting.  Didn't try much of the dessert, but the cookies were extremely buttery (yum) and they got some legit legit mint chocolate chip ice cream!  Of course, there was the famous chocolate fountain but kids were hogging up that area so I didn't bother with it.  Service was a standout.  Our server had this Southern hospitality-quality to him and just from watching him interact with other tables, I can tell this guy is gonna get a lot of tips!  For $8.29, it's not bad at all for buffet.  It doesn't include a drink, so if you add a drink, it costs about the same or a little more than Hometown, and I gotta say, Golden Corral is waaaay better than Hometown."}
{"text":"The lady at the front was so sweet. Honestly the only one who had a smile on their face. Food was unappetizing and almost everything was undercooked. How can you even undercook bacon?"}
{"text":"Been to other Golden Corrals...this one...eehh not so good.  Bathrooms were a wreck, I noticed they were in the middle of remodeling but that doesn't mean they shouldn't be clean.  Tables were left covered with dishes after people left and not wiped down.  Garbage all over the floors while the waitstaff sat at a table. I seen a cook come out of the bathroom with an apron on,  a bit unsanitary.  Does anyone take pride in their work anymore?"}
{"text":"There was a variety of food surely to please the vast majority.   They restocked the food almost constantly and therefore all was fairly fresh.  All the food our party had was good and hot.    You definitely need to come there hungry or with a empty stomach to get your money's worth."}
{"text":"Great service! Great food! Lots of selection at the buffet. Bbq chicken is excellent. First night opened. (for businesses in area.)"}
{"text":"The service was great! I was getting refills and plates were being cleared with such a great frequency. The food was okay and nothing to really \"weite home\" about. Where the poor ratings come from are the bathrooms. The bathroom was disgusting. Besides the trash on the floor, there were human feces in the corners around the toilet. I'm also attaching a picture."}
{"text":"First time here in a year. Wanted to give it another chance...mistake. no management present. Rude staff...food was terrible...thanks for the raw chicken. It's a shame golden corral in other cities is great. Need to rethink your franchisee in vegas"}
{"text":"Short, and to the point.....the service is good.  Friendly, and courteous staff.  But.....the food is not good at all.    I felt like i was in a prison buffet of some sort."}
{"text":"Let's start with the cons. 1) the chicken was undercooked  2) Mac and cheese had no flavor or color  3) mash potatoes didn't taste right 4) men's bathroom was nasty with tp on the floor and other things  5) pricing for 2 people $30  Now with that said the pros great waitress working tonight was super nice and that's pretty much it as for if I would come back I don't think I will sadly"}
{"text":"We went to this location because it was closer to our hotel. We went to the one in Surprise, AZ yesterday and that one was great. This one however is the exact opposite of what the one in Surprise was. It started right away. We ordered drinks and a chocolate milk for my 2yr old and were told you'll get it at your table. Then we were told they didn't sell chocolate milk. Then they argued about it and we're rude to my wife about it. The majority of the food appeared to be inedible. Now I'll say they got one star cuz the steak was good and so was pot roast and the banana pudding was excellent. Our waitress was very kind and courteous and kept our drinks filled and table cleared even though being very pregnant. Now let me tell you about the filth!!! They're lucky and so are you I can't post pictures because they are appalling. From the food stations, the wall surrounding our table and OMFG they restroom. Please do yourself a favor and do not eat here."}
{"text":"Whoa... A couple years ago this place was amazing. Now they've really gone downhill. I've decided to come back and they aren't the Golden Corral I went to a couple years ago. This one was really getting cheap now. Back then their food was just beautiful and amazing but now it tastes all bland and plain."}
{"text":"Had a senior lunch on 3/18/18. $15.30 for one person. I ate about $6.00 worth. Something odd at the salad bar. Perhaps tomatoes or the mushrooms(had a dirt flavor) Here I am 15 hours later with the bathroom effects. (as not to be too graphic) I am so disappointed."}
{"text":"Gross.  This place is dirty.  Every surface and utensil feels crusted and sticky.  I left feeling disgusted that I actually ate the food and fed it to my children.  While there is a wide variety of dishes, none actually looked appetizing and most tasted worse than they looked.  Salad bar items were frozen blocks.  Pumpkin pie was oddly translucent."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast lunch or dinner.   I won't be getting tired of this place for a long time.  Good food."}
{"text":"I took my mom to this place last week.  We decided to go on a Tuesday for lunch being that we went there on Sunday, and the wait was going to be at least 1 hour.    The food = 3.5 stars - lots of variety, but overall, only the mashed potatoes and gravy were tasty.  I also had the popcorn shrimp, which was okay.  The steamed fish was just salty, but pretty bland.  Service = 1 star.  We had Stephanie as our lousy waitress.  I watched her refill drinks and offer water to other tables, but not to us.  I asked her for 2 glasses of water and she took forever to get them to us.    I won't be back for a long time."}
{"text":"The place is literally a combat zone in the evenings.  So packed with people it's impossible to keep clean.  A steamy, dishroom atmosphere pervades the place.  Most of the help are of questionable US citizenship.  The food reminds me of a USMC chow hall on a bad day.  I'll give this place 2 stars for one reason:  They give vets a free meal on Veterans Day."}
{"text":"Dirty, food was cold, way too many people and no one is regulating to make sure food isn't handled incorrectly. Kids were going up to the ice cream machine and then dipping their ice cream cones into the chocolate syrup dispenser spout after licking their cone. Three waitresses and kitchen workers witnessed this and nothing was done. Won't be coming back! Disgusting!"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time ever on Mother's Day. They were packed ,the line was out the door and down the path. Still they managed to get everyone seated and quickly attended to. We were a party of 10  our server was so great and i am sorry to say i do not remember her name. She had all 10 drinks refilled continuously. Brought us lemons and cleared the table with amazing speed, as well as taking care of a completely full restaurant packed with Children that were running under foot.   The only down part was that they had plastic dishes but, with all those people what are your choices. I loved the food. I had shrimp and fish and vegetables.  Nothing fried.       The best part for me was the Chocolate fondu!!  Although there were many different choices. You could never say that you did not like what they were serving.  have seen a million adverts for this place and i am happy that i finally got to go."}
{"text":"Horrible cold food!   Kitchen staff was standing around, not putting any food out.  Everything was cold, rolls were hard, nothing was refilled.  The food that was available was very old.  The best part was our waitress!  She was great!  Update - Didn't make it 5 miles down the road. We had to make an emergency stop to use the bathroom.  Everyone was throwing up and diarrhea."}
{"text":"Well the price was good but I was expecting more... Not to many options and I didn't like the food it had no taste to it. The waiter took for ever to serve us refills and I really thought the place was amazing but in reality it let me down.. :("}
{"text":"Food wasn't that great, the cooks were on their phones. Probably had 6 different plates because I only took 2 bites (If that) out of everything, definitely will not be going back to that location.."}
{"text":"Golden corral breakfast is great. Make sure you sit in Milli's section as she is the best server they got."}
{"text":"We just ate here last week and we came back again for dinner. They still have that \"meatlovers madness\" going on. The sirloin steak was just right, bummer wasnt able to take a pic. i like their boneless beef ribs too and the chicken barbeque was so good!  Our server Samantha was very accommodating and smiling all the time. It seems that she loves what she does unlike the last server we had. Samantha's side is by the salad bar part. This is the second time we had her as our server."}
{"text":"I would honestly give this place a zero rating if I could. Went there for the first and only time. Was total chaos on a Sunday afternoon at 1pm, which normally we would be fine, but the staff wasn't accommodating at all. Fruit flies all around the food on all buffet stations, server was more occupied with talking to friends/maybe good tipping customers than to rest of section, no pre bussing of dishes (and our table was small for the size of our table to begin with) and forget about refills. 3 day old cold ramen noodles would be a better meal choice. Everyone in my party agreed that was the worst"}
{"text":"They have a white chocolate, chocolate and caramel fountain! !! Great for desert fanatics like me  :] Overall  this is an buffet with lots of fresh food and awesome dessert choices for kids of any age. Ever since this location opened, I have not step back to hometown buffet. For the price and quality HT does not compare. Only draw back, the quality has been slipping from they first opened but still very tasty. The average wait time is bearable now and so far service has been excellent there."}
{"text":"We go here way too often, the foods great (except the Chinese food they offer... Yuck!). The chicken is moist, the favors are good!  I will say they are not too good at grilling steaks. They will put a stick stating its med well when in fact it's super rare! Sometimes you do get lucky with the steaks, but not often enough."}
{"text":"Well I'm happy to say that our 'free' dinner was pretty darn good. I don't know her name but the lady manager with the long blondish hair remembered us and she was so nice. Happy to report a positive review. Thank you, I really appreciate the follow-up and we will definitely be back! :)"}
{"text":"This location sucks!!!! I would normally give Golden Corral a 3 or 4 star. We just moved here and have been to golden corral many times In Colorado. But we were very disappointed the night we were here, We went an hour before closing on a Friday night, food was not fresh, no steak ready. They dont have near the food selection that were used to.I asked the manager for a refund for my food, I had lost my appetite and Im not that picky. Server was good, but I probably wont return."}
{"text":"Holy shit. This is my first time at Golden Corral and I was already a little sceptical because of their reviews, but I wanted to try it myself. Well, all I can say is they're lucky the servers were so kind because if they weren't they'd have one star. I got a slice of pizza just because it's tradition for me to get it at buffets and wow! It was completely uncooked? The dough was slimy and was not cooked at all! I was disgusted! Okay, fine. Bad pizza. Not surprising with buffets. So, I go to get some shrimp and bite down on something that feels like a rock. The lettuce was pretty gross and old, so that wasn't very good either. The soups tasted old and everything else wasn't any better. Finally, I got dessert and blegh. Again, everything was stale and old. Very sad. I won't be coming back, but props to the great service! Everyone was so nice and helpful. None of this is their fault, so I didn't blame them or got upset at them."}
{"text":"I still think everything is still good I just don't understand why the price has to be higher on mother's day & they had the same food as all the rest of the times I went there I think that part was a rip but still love the food"}
{"text":"You will not go home hungry. This restaurant has the best buffet in town. This also is a place that makes you feel like family. Must try the mini cheeseburgers at lunch. If it is out at the bar they will bring it to you when it comes out. I can't say enough about this place. They have so much to choose from it is unbelievable from meats to the salad bar, pizza, soups / chili , veggies and don't forget the deserts. If you don't like lunch or dinner go to the breakfast buffet they have everything, Fresh omelets and fried eggs, meats ,waffles and casseroles. Free juice and milk at the salad bar WOW. Thanks to everyone at the concord golden corral .J & P. THE FOOD DUDE"}
{"text":"You know,  I don't know why more people don't frequent this place.  Seriously...I converse with coworkers and it's as if I am admitting to eating at a cookout in a trailer park or something.  Is this what we have become?  Put aside the negative perception of all-you-can-eat places just this once.  You don't have to tell your coworkers.  Let them continue to frequent $40 a plate eating establishments while you join us peasants for some real eatin'.   It's not fine dining, for sure, but I am always amazed at the quality of the food. The staff is definitely on the ball as far as keeping it fresh and available.  Bottom line: It's tasty!    Still, I would be remiss if I didn't let you know that, yeah, it attracts a salt-of-the-earth crowd.  If you can get over this hang-up, I promise you will leave with your belly full.  Be sure to try the Jack Daniel's Bourbon Chicken."}
{"text":"Clearly this restaurant has lack of communication between their employees. I called in the morning to make sure the 2 for $20 was going on and they said yes it was. Then we got here and it wasn't. Yes I know it is only a $5 difference, but the point is I called and checked and they didn't know. Then they split our party of 6 up because they didn't have a table and they saw no problem with it. Won't come here again because of bad customer service"}
{"text":"So, I haven't been here since I was a kid. My daughter wanted to go here for her birthday. Reluctant we said yes, It was her birthday.   Positives - The soda was good  Negative - Food was horrible! Not enough room for anyone to eat. Packed in like dogs. Service was horrible. Ice cream was frozen water.   Will never go back unless I have to. Forced too!"}
{"text":"This buffet is awesome if you are craving to stuff your face and do not want to go to hometown or those other buffet places. This buffet has everything that you want. It has a grilling station for steaks, which is not bad by buffet standards (you still need to put A1 sauce on it), a station for Chinese food, salads, breads and biscuits, a huge selection of desserts which also includes a ice cream scoop station, cotton candy station, and a chocolate fountain where you can dip almost anything in melted chocolate. The prices here are pretty good. I think for the same amount for hometown you can go here instead or it might be a buck more or so, but its worth it if you are super hungry. Service was also awesome and very nice. If you are coming, come early and expect to wait in line for a while because this place just opened."}
{"text":"These 5 stars are for Niky the best most attentive waitress!  I have had her twice and normally wouldn't notice if I had the same server twice.....mostly because I'm tending to my busy busy kids!  Niky, even though she has a new hairstyle since last time,  stood right out the second I got to my table.  Man, she is sooooo nice and sincere.  I just wanted to give a shout out to her!  She wont know me, I don't go often but I'd like to know she made our experience great!  Thanks for helping me with the cotton candy today hahahaha."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to get the family together and just have good food and laughs. The dessert area seems to always be a mess but besides that I enjoy going."}
{"text":"Two words: Absolutely Not.  This place is complete junk. The meat is pure rubber. I would give this place zero stars if I could. Golden Corral prides itself on being fresh, but we all know that's not true. Remember the 2013 scandal?   Please don't come here."}
{"text":"First up i hate when ppl say some place or ppl are ghetto, its like what does that mean. O MY GOD if you want to know what ghetto is this place is it. It was about 1:00 so we figured kids in school so shouldnt h to crowded. The worst dining experience we've had. From the time we walked thru the door, we hadnt even poured our sodas. First thing we hear is  Jada a waitress or something cursing up a storm talking about someone, man talk about your first impressions, we should have turned around and left but  we didnt. There was only one person in front of us place was about half full. Got our drinks paid $8.99 for lunch and $1.99 for drinks, we've been to other Golden Corrals so we're no amateurs. Proceded to find a table almost every available table was filthy, found one in the back. So many families and really small children. Now u cant fault a restaurant by the way patrons act, rude adults piling up plates like the food police r going to come & cut them off, u can go back for seconds its a buffet people,and bad ass kids tearing shit up running around, but i can fault u on cleanliness. Food everywhere on the floors. Everystation was dirty containers half full or empty nothing was fresh, sliders were premade and cold. All i came for was a salad, seriously i had been craving a huge salad, even the cold food for salads looked horrible. Nothing we had tasted like they bothered to season it we salt & peppered everything it really didnt help. This location does not represent all Golden Corrals trust me"}
{"text":"I love this place! the food is always good, such a big variety, and prices are reasonable. I love the fact that you dont have to walk thru a big casino to go to a buffet. My favorite is the bbq and fried chicken here. The only bad thing it can get very busy at times."}
{"text":"been waiting to try this place since they always have long line for the past 2 months.Got my chance to try it after my costco trip.the line move quicky ,but i think the food in my gut moved faster.This place is a hit and miss on the food, corn bread was bad,but the chicken was good, steaks where ok,but the pudding was better.My taste buds where like..WTF ? GIVE ME SOMETHING TO WORK WITH HERE !.Im giving this place a 2 star just because they had something they called food and a place to sit.I suggest going to woodgrill in norwalk or sizzler"}
{"text":"This place one of the worst Golden Corrals I've ever been to. The food is decent but the management is horrible and unhelpful. They treat their staff and guests horrible. Mediocre attitude and unprofessional customer service by management!"}
{"text":"not a fan. the overall experience was not something im happy about. the price for coming here was definitely not worth it. the food, not to good and the plates were dirty. the only real enjoyable thing for me was the chocolate fountain. other then that nothing. also the employees were nice but I still dont find myself coming here again."}
{"text":"I've read other reviews for this location and I think I may just have a skewed view of things. This place is always clean, the food is hot and has a good flavor. To some it may be over spiced but for me, it's good eat in'!  The drinks are not included, but I feel the price is fair considering its an all you care to eat buffet and they serve steak and other items which you don't usually find in the usual buffet.   The variety is good. Soup and salad bar; entrees like baked chicken or fish and hot sides; grill with steaks and ribs; Chinese and Mexican dishes; dessert and breads.  Love their cheesy broccoli soup and the salad bar is well stocked."}
{"text":"Ok so this is probably the nastiest, worst restaurant I've ever been to in my life. The staff was not friendly or helpful. The food was definitely frozen and either really over salted or under salted. I would never come back ever in my entire life."}
{"text":"Alright guys you guys are being to harsh in GC sure the food and stuff might not be the best in the world. But think about it what do you expect from a 10 dollar buffet? So overall I was satisfied not as bad as people say because it is indeed a cheap buffet but yeh not the best thus the 4 star."}
{"text":"Stopped by for Friday lunch. Cheap buffet. We saw the lines there but the wait time wasn't that bad. Had some corns, veggies, chicken wings, fruits. It was like party food.  Ice cream was good though.  Overall not bad for the price."}
{"text":"avoid waiting in line by being the early bird! Line is ridiculously long, but worth the wait."}
{"text":"After taking the 40 minute drive from Southern Highlands passing all of the wonderful buffets we have here in Las Vegas we decided to give the one low cost option a shot. Pricing online is incorrect manager didn't want to hear anything about that told me it was corporate called we already driven so far we decided to give it a try. The best thing they've got going or is there a custom grilled steaks made to order that part is pretty bomb other than that vegetables are watery and unflavored.. side dishes I wanted a baked potato but there was no butter or chives in sight even though I asked they just shrug their shoulders like they didn't know what I was talking about. Dessert options were kind of boring the only highlight was that we got cotton candy at the end have to say I think the cotton candy was the best thing about this place."}
{"text":"I had high expectations but this restraunt is in drastic need to be remodeled.  Our server was good but the meats were dry and the options were limited.  The restraunt as a whole looked dirty."}
{"text":"First time there.  Not bad for a buffet.  Lots of choices.  Fresh vegetables, the shrimp was wonderful!  The desserts left much to be desired, though the peanut butter cookies were good.  We will be back again sometime."}
{"text":"It's my little ones graduation today we decided to go to Golden Corral which is her favorite we get in there and start eating in about 20 minutes later we see a roach on the table I told the server AND SHE killed it then a couple minutes later we see another one I CALLED the waiter and she stated oh we've been spraying so they wOnt come back anyhow the kids were discussed  and I was too so we were ready to go as I was walking towards the door I seen the store manager who is Jeff I said to him this is disgusting AND may I please have a refund he snatched my receipt and said I was here for over 45 minutes and now I can't have a refund I said TO JEFF who is your supervisor or manager are you corporate or are you franchise he  really got offended and started talking crazy, I told him that he has horrible management skills then he stated he was going to call the police and have me arrested so I called the police and waited and when the officers arrived I ask the officer please ask the manager if  I CAN have a refund the officer asked him he said the same thing because I was over 30 minutes the officer laughed at him and said the roaches waited 30 minutes to come out I believe  he still refused and actED belligerent this is the worst experience I've ever seen at Golden Corral please don't ever take your kids there ."}
{"text":"OMG this place is horrible. I wouldn't not wait in line to come eat here. I had maybe one thing that tasted good. A roll :/ everything else was kind of bland. People don't like to take care of there kids here. Only thing ok bout this place is the chocolate fountain and the red velvet cupcake. Will not be coming back"}
{"text":"Okay I know I never write reviews about chain restaurants but for Golden Corral, I'll make an exception.  I am writing this review for 3 reasons:  1.  Southern California does have any Golden Corrals, so this is an entirely new experience. 2.  Every time I drove by, there is a line out the door - so it must be good right? 3.  I love buffets.  First off, the wait on a Wednesday night was 45 minutes at 8pm. Talk about a wait.  People are all pushy and stuff in line too. I think people we're all headed the same place, why be rude?    It's around $12 per person, which is a good price.  So we finally get in and the place is filled to capacity.  I scanned all the offerings and I gotta say there wasn't much.  They had an extensive dessert area but I was more interested in what I was having for dinner.  Off the top of my head, here is what I saw:  1.  Popcorn shrimp 2.  Fried Fish 3.  Steak fries 4.  Pizza 5.  Meatloaf  6.  Pasta 7.  Ribs 8.  Ham 9.  Salad bar  It was okay quality. The popular stuff was often left empty.  I tried some of the things I listed and it was okay tasting after having to fight with rude folks cutting in line or just hogging everything.  I guess what people really like here is that they offer steak and its supposedly cooked to your desired temperature [which it wasn't].  The portions given were about 1 inch by 3 inch rectangular piece.  I know it's hard to satisfy the masses but having to get up multiple times to piece together a steak got annoying.  The staff was actually really nice. I really don't know how they deal with the crazy, rude and greedy clientele. I think I'd have a headache each and every day I worked there.  All in all, it wasn't worth the wait. It's similar to Hometown buffet.  I'd rather just go to some cheap Chinese buffet locally."}
{"text":"It's Golden Corral. The food is neither great nor bad. It's Golden Corral. The server was around as was appropriate. Refilling our drinks. It's Golden Corral. We all know what to expect. I fully believe that all Golden Corrals are Meccas for carnies. Or at least, aspiring carnies. It's Golden Corral, get it? It's a little pricey for buffet fare, but you get so many options. The food is as plentiful as the clientele is porcine.   Seriously though, get the mac and cheese.  And the mashed potatoes.   On the same plate.  Do it."}
{"text":"Have dined here for a weekday lunch and a weekend dinner and for the price, I have little complaints about Golden Corral!   I've been spoiled with Asian-themed buffets here in Vegas so it was a nice change to dine eating various types of food. I love the variation from BBQ pulled pork to mashed potatoes to cheeseburgers sliders and so on.   But my favorite thing to eat.. what I have multiple plates of would be... Their yeast rolls. Yessir, YEAST ROLLS. The softest, fluffiest pillows of bread heaven.. paired with their whipped honey butter. I would pay $8 just to get unlimited amounts of that bread.   Everything else though is A-OK. Nothing special but like I said, a good change from what I am used to. For the price, you can't go wrong. Especially if you end your meal with a big cloud of cotton candy.   What can I say? I'm easily amused. :)"}
{"text":"The food is terrible.  I went here for breakfast and they couldn't even get that right.  I mean how do you screw up bacon and eggs?  I dislike this place so much that when my in laws came down they insisted we go there, I faked being sick so I wouldn't have to go."}
{"text":"The food is terrible.  I went here for breakfast and they couldn't even get that right.  I mean how do you screw up bacon and eggs?  I dislike this place so much that when my in laws came down they insisted we go there, I faked being sick so I wouldn't have to go."}
{"text":"This location is a joke. I paid $30 and there was literally nothing in half the pans. The waitress ignored me and my girlfriend with getting us drinks. Perhaps because we are tattooed and pierced she passed bias on us (which is discrimination btw.) and felt she didn't need to serve us. I was willing to let it all go because I kept telling myself I'll just pig out on dessert, sadly no. The dessert bar was the biggest disappointment ever. I got vanilla ice cream thinking I'm gonna load it with sprinkles and oreo bit but all they had was three containers of gummy bears and nuts, nothing else. The floors were filthy, the wait staff unpleasant, and the food lousy. I'm so glad I just wasted 30 dollars to go eat in a third world country."}
{"text":"This is the best buffet outside of Vegas. I can see why the obesity rate is increasing every year with all you can eat food like this! They have a pretty good variety of food, all decent quality. People can be a bit pushy at times, but isn't that the charm of a buffet? I wear my hockey gear on steak night because NOBODY comes between me and my prime rib!"}
{"text":"Ok so here we go. Being from TX Golden Corral is not a popular choice for me because of all the other great buffets such as Furrs and Ryans. Golden Corral is a big chain and all over the place but with that being said I tried it because there are no Furrs or Ryans in CA and I heard this place just opened. Everything here is typical of what they do in TX  except 1. the long lines (unheard of), 2. They don't bring rolls to your table, 3. The service is not good at all. I hardley ever tip and service must be awful for me not to (my tip for the waiter--smile and act like you want me to be happy) The food selection is as I expected not much of  choice compared to a Furrs. This is cool if you have some time to spend and chat with friends and family but I caution you on the long lines.   Tip: If you plan on going for dinner, take some chairs, blanket, books and pack a lunch! The lines are horrible and I have never seen such long lines at a Golden Corral ever!"}
{"text":"It would be the first and last time. You literally get what you pay for, and I would rather pay and eat somewhere else. The place is just plain disgusting, dirty, and smells bad. I couldn't make myself eat, so I really don't know if the food is even good. Maybe if I get pass how dirty the place is.... I could try to eat. But why would I even want to try the food, if the place is so dirty? \"Eek! Methinks not.\""}
{"text":"Okay, the last time my family went here it was a disaster.... But i wasn't hungry for Chinese buffet so we thought we would give them one last try... My son in the car begging us not to go... Should've listened to him!  I can't even start to explain how unbelievably FILTHY this place is! The tray they give you on the way in to put your drinks on had food on it and was all wet...... Then walk to the dishes to start this friggin nightmare.... Had to go through so many forks and spoons to find one that doesn't have food and nasty on it..... Then to the food bar..... Looking through.... Everything was UNBELIEVABLY FILTHY! Lettuce had food all through it.... Dressing had food like olives and croutons floating on the top, and the dressing was all over the outside of the crocks... On all of them..... Nasty food all through the different crocks that had other foods you put on your salad... Well i decided i would skip the salad and go for the other stuff... So i walked over there....  FILTHY!!!!!!!! Old food that looked like it was sitting there for days.....i saw they just put out some chicken so bolted over there to get something fresh.... Took back to table.... My son brought these old old pancakes over.... They were so old and dried out he couldn't cut it with a fork.. Had to use a knife... He's like ewwww what's that, pointing to something nasty on his pancake...i said it's prob a bug.... He said, dad, did you see the chocolate fountain? I said God no... I won't go near that thing from the last time we were here... He said you gotta look at it....i walked over and it was all dried out.... Dried Chocolate spattered everywhere!!! I mean freaking NASTY!   Wife gets to table and was grossed out because some lady was putting lettuce on her plate with her bare hands!!! Haha... Now it started getting funny because it was one thing after another....i went up again and saw a guy that was working there dump cooked broccoli in the bin and guiding it in with his other hand, that had a freaking band aid on his finger!!! So i get back to the table and tell my family and they are busting up laughing because it's so damned disgusting!!! Ok here's the clincher..... We are all sitting around the table still discussing how Groce this place is, and all of the sudden my son looks over to the carpet and yells... Is that toilet paper???? I looked over and started busting out laughing.... Freaking toilet paper about three feet long just laying in the middle of the floor.... And nobody picking it up!!. People.... DO NOT EAT HERE!!!! I WILL NEVER EVER EVER EVER EAT HERE AGAIN!!!!  I said to my wife and son when we were leaving, at least we got some great laughs out of all of this! My son said at least they have a gallon jug of sanitizer here to use!! (It was full to the top as no one was using it!) It was so damned FILTHY it was comical....i felt like i was in an episode of Sanford & Son!!! Freaking awful! Wish i could give it a zero!"}
{"text":"First time having it. You defiantly get your moneys worth and the taste is actually good, customer service was good as well"}
{"text":"The line is ridiculously long! I can see why the herd of people come here, the price is incredibly inexpensive for the variety of food they have available. The food quality is a notch higher than Hometown Buffet. They have really tasteful steaks here made to your liking, cotton candy, and real ice cream, not soft serve, but real authentic ice cream. Not too bad for a whopping $12 or so. Would I come here again? Maybe, but it sure won't be anytime soon. I am claustrophobic and the thought of having to go through the whole waiting in line ordeal and squeezing my derriere through the crowds just to get to the food items is pretty anxiety inducing for me. So for the price, the food quality is right, but not worth an anxiety attack for me, it's just not worth it."}
{"text":"We've been here twice and had good experiences both times. It's a bit of a drive, but a great place to go with the kids because my two kids have completely different eating habits. Last night my son chowed down on popcorn shrimp and grilled fish, with sautéed mushrooms and veggies. Then they have options for my picky daughter, French toast and macaroni and cheese haha.. They have something for everyone and the chocolate fountain for dessert is always fun."}
{"text":"I went to Golden Corral with my boyfriend and I swear every time we go it is more expensive than the last time. Right now all they have is shrimp, shrimp, shrimp. Do not get me wrong I like shrimp but, more variety of meat would be nice. There food is OK. Nothing more, nothing less. The staff is very nice though, especially are waitress Samantha. She was amazing. So to end this, the food is not worth the price."}
{"text":"Not up to par with other Golden Corrals.  Out of most juices at lunch time and staff was very uninviting.  Had to get everything myself anyways when we did ask the wait staff.  No system for the omelete section.  People left fixings and came back later.  They only had egg beaters and were unable to make sunny side up.  Loved tge golden corrals in Florida, but not the same here."}
{"text":"Have been here several times each time was a horrible experience. Poor food quality, not a very tasty selection, this establishment is poorly ran"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner. Everything tasted pretty good, but I am a HUGE fan of their Fried Chicken Livers. I hate beef liver, but these are delicious. Their Prime Rib and Golden Shrimp are pretty good to. But after dinner, I felt like a kid again, walking out."}
{"text":"Came for the lunch shit. No steak. But it's only 8.99 so I can't complain. This is definatly a good place for overweight people. All kinds of fried foods and mac n cheese. The bathrooms were suprisingly really clean.. but some little shit was standing next to my stall the whole time while I was in there. Little black feet in my stall and shit. They refilled our beverages very well, but this is lunch so I can't say anything about dinner.. wait I can. They took out the fucking white chocolate fondue! ! If you're looking for white chocolate fondue look somewhere else.. but this is all just advice do whatever... the FUCK you wanna do"}
{"text":"As American buffet places go, there is a good amount of variety here. True, there's a long line when you enter, but it's expected...the wait is about 30 minute plus.  The interior is fairly big.  There's fish section, Mexican section, beef section, dessert section, salads, etc. etc.    It's by a shopping plaza and there's plenty of parking.  The quality certainly beats Hometown Buffet and is  perhaps around the level of Wood Grill Buffet.  About three of my friends and I came here as there was a two for $20 special going on.  The meat was juicy, I loved the chocolate-dipped strawberries, and the general variety of it all really makes this place.  The layout of the interior isn't the best admittedly. The lines can snake around haphazardly where people would accidentally find themselves cutting in line while getting meat.  Pretty good for a buffet place.  Admittedly, I tend to avoid buffet places."}
{"text":"Ok.  I've read a number of the reviews, and the first thing to say is - why would you go to a buffet and then be disappointed it's a buffet?  I mean. . .duh? Oh, so your friends/family/someone else's fault dragged you here!  So what?  It's a buffet?  You had a choice, you could have said \"no!\"  The first time I went into a modern style buffet (wasn't a Hometown, but same concept), I knew that it had been conceived by a military mess NCO.  This is mess hall food. Food cooked en masse for a lot of hungry people at the same time.  When you cook eggs by the case, you don't get that personal chef touch, so you can't expect that cooked for you taste.  And so it goes for the rest of the food.  The bottom line - if you want a nice, quiet setting, with food cooked to your order, then DON'T GO TO A BUFFET, ANY BUFFET!  As buffets go, this is the best at which I've eaten!  The quality of the food and cooking is better by far than Hometown or any other in So Cal.  The selection is better and wider, and you actually can get steak cooked basically to order.  All you can eat steak, for $14!  It's not Claim Jumper or Outback, but then it's not $35 either.   The cleanliness is about what you would expect for a place that's constantly filled to capacity most of the day.  So far, each time I've been the seats and tables are wiped off and clean, and the plates, cups and utensils have all been clean.  The negative - well, the only problem I have, and it's the sole reason for four stars instead of five, is that although they make regular announcements over the speakers that children must have an adult with them at all times, they do not station employees to monitor the counters to enforce that rule on all the people who don't monitor their kids.  So small children are often getting their own food, and demonstrating exactly why they shouldn't be.  I even had a small problem yesterday afternoon. It was a minor issue, but the manager handed me his business card with a coupon for a free dinner on my next visit.  My recommendation: if you're looking for a nice sit-down restaurant, go somewhere else - but if you want an all-you-can-eat buffet, this is the best!"}
{"text":"Go early, or late, to avoid the long line. But don't be fooled by the line, the food definitely isn't worth the wait.  In addition to the long line to get into the restaurant, you gotta wait for them to refill half of the food items. I mean, you see tons of people working yet they're not really doing anything. The items at the salad bar was edible. Most of the food items were below average, they were either tasteless or were overly high in sodium. The lighting was harsh and the whole time I felt like I was in a cafeteria.  Tables were placed very closely to each other that there was barely any room for people to walk by. Even the skinniest girl would have to walk sideways and still brush past my shoulder.  The only thing worth praising about was our attentive waitress who seemed to always pop up at our table at the right times: when our half-empty cup needed a refill, when our plates were emptied, when we were done with our meal and she asked if we needed coffee to go with our dessert.  Other than that, I wouldn't give this place a single star if there was an option for that.  Needless to say, I wouldn't go back there. Not even for their chocolate fountain."}
{"text":"Foods surprisingly good! Salad bar was so so though. The type of people that come here- pass. Super crowded for a weekday, cant imagine how bad it gets during the weekends. People costantly cut infront of you while your still serving yourself or while your walking to get just around the place.  Had one big tattooed girl insult me as she passed by me. Yeah, no thanks. I dont need to feel uncomfortable by some jerk I have to be elbow to elbow with."}
{"text":"It had been a while since my husband and I had eaten here.  Back in 2008, we lived up the road from the place and would go occasionally.  The food was fresh and well-seasoned, and the place was well-maintained.  Flash-forward to 2016, and the food has become mediocre, even for a buffet.  Today, we straddled breakfast and lunch to get the best of both worlds.  I wasn't impressed with either.  I got some of their bacon, and it was too salted.  I could get past only one of them.  I got some of their eggs.  Again, too salted.  I moved on to lunch and got a small piece of their fried chicken.  You guessed it:  too salted.  Their macaroni and cheese, which is normally delectable, tasted like it came out of the box.  The cabbage wasn't sufficiently cooked and neither was the squash.  Blech.  The redeemers of this cornucopia of disaster were the mashed potatoes, soft-serve ice cream, and pecan pie.  The potatoes were homemade, with just enough lumps to give it that authentic taste and buttered enough to not feel overpowered with guilt for clogging your arteries.  The soft-serve, simple enough, was smooth and not overly icy.  The pecan pie was pure heaven.  It was a little chilly, but there was a stellar balance of pecan to the filling.  I didn't want to overdo it, so I only ate half of it.  I am giving it three stars because our server was great.  She was attentive and concerned about our experience.  When we needed refills, we didn't have to ask.  She promptly cleared our used plates when necessary.  I was happy to give her a big tip; her job looks pretty challenging.  Would I go back?  Probably.  I get the feeling that this was just an off-day for them.  I'll hold off for a couple of months and make the 30-mile trek back to see if they take it back to 2008 when they were better."}
{"text":"My family of 9, went last night to the only location in Las Vegas and I was stunned upon entering. The \"bottle necking\" entrance was a poor design. Who ever decided that it was a good idea for families to get their drinks first then the parents fumble between the drinks, kids  and the wallet to pay should be fired. Jon Taffer of Bar Rescue might be able to provide some scientific feedback on proper flow into the restaurant. Seating was crowded, not to mention the space between tables and the buffet lines were not wide enough to allow guests to properly pass one another without bumping elbows. There should be condiment locations at specific locations or both ends for easier access. The food over all was good but the ambience and layout were poor.   Suggestion, relocate the self service beverage bar past the cashier and continue to let it be self service. We had to wait on a server for refills as he pre occupied with clearing dirty dishes and cleaning the tables."}
{"text":"Just what will people pay to have access to an endless feeding trough of mediocrity?  In Concord, it's $7.59 at lunch.  The veggies are cooked until there is virtually no flavor to them.  The rest of the fare isn't much better.  Don't ask me what I was thinking!"}
{"text":"This is ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT buffet with fondue fountains in action!  ~I will start with dessert because this place now has a triple fountain!!! There's the chocolate wonderfall fountain, and they now added a white chocolate falls and a sweet caramel falls. Dessert is fun here!! You dip strawberries, marshmallows, apples, and rice crispies in any of the fountains. The only drawback is that I never have room for any other dessert after indulging in any of the chocolate or caramel fountains, Ugh :(((  Tip: if they run out of strawberries or other items for dipping in fountain, ask them for more! They ran out of strawberries at some point, and I asked one of the ladies in the background to go and put some more! Practically another bucket of strawberries came out after that!   Now for the real grub (highlights) :  ~chicken wings - These literally fly off in seconds (they don't call em' \"wings\" for nothing :P). Keep an eye out for this one because the vultures will be sniffin' around :P  ~Fried catfish is good - better than most places out there. The batter actually stays on the fish, and it is crispy too. The fish does not taste muddy at all.  ~pot roast - Another popular item here. I went back only to find this empty on several occasions.  ~Grilled steaks - you can choose how you want your steak done. However, I didn't exactly get my steak medium rare the first time around. Other than that, it's not a bad steak!  ~Fried chicken is decent, and so is the clam chowder.  This is mainly American/comfort food, but there are some Chinese and Mexican items as well. There's also unlimited salad bar, some BBQ items, and the usual kiddie food like pizza.  Kids under 12 are only $5.99 which includes all you can eat real grub, dessert and unlimited drinks. Yes, even the soft drink is included in the price. That is one heck of a great deal. If you have a kid that knows how to take advantage of buffet, then bring em' down! My son can eat!!  Kids 3 years and under are free. Kids 12 and over will be charged adult price. Adult pricing is $11.99, but does not include soft drink. Fountain drinks are $1.99. But that's OK with me and my spouse because we prefer to drink water at a buffet instead of gassy soft drinks, that way we have more belly room to grub!  There's always a line here, and I do mean ALWAYS!!! We actually waited for only 20 minutes, so we got lucky. But my friend Brian who visits this place regularly says he waits for almost an hour, with the line going out the door most of the time. Prepare to wait at least 1-1/2 to 2 hours on Veteran's Day. We've been to Golden Corral on Veteran's Day (Hesperia location), and that's just how it is for a complimentary meal!!"}
{"text":"My only complaint about this establishment is that there doesn't seem to be a shortage of kids running rampant throughout the dining areas almost tripping me to the ground with my food in hand.   I can't stress enough that the mothers & fathers of this day & age are a real sad excuse for parents.  This country needs to have a one-child-per-family law in effect, but that's never going to happen so let's get on with the review.  Of course that is not Golden Corral's fault.  What Golden Corral IS at fault for has to be that they have completely made me fall head over heels for their food.  I am a native San Antonio, Texan & have been to Golden Corral periodically throughout my years spent there.  I'd say Once a year is a good estimate.  Anyway, after moving here to Arizona, I found that you, too, have GC.  I hadn't been to GC in about 2 or 3 years.  We went one night after work & loved it completely.  Everything from the nice hot bread served by the waitress, to the popcorn shrimp, to the pot roast I love so dearly was amazing.  I found no faults with the food there.   It is even better than I remember.   The Pot Roast is to die for.  The Fried Chicken is still juicy as ever.  The Steak, wonderful.  Lovely variety of vegetables, mashed potaoes, & macaroni & cheese.  And then there's the bread.  Oh My God, the rolls.  Great food.  We've been back once more and still have nothing negative to say about them, except that we still encountered kids wanting to turn the restaurant into a stinking playground!   Money's been tight so we can't go back as often as we'd like.  Still, PARENTS:  Check your kids!  Golden Corral gets 5 stars, baby."}
{"text":"Had a bad experience here the girl in the register was so rude to me and my girlfriend, we came to this restaurant to meet other family that was already waiting for us to arrive not knowing you can't pay in advance for other people that haven't arrived yet, the girl at the register didn't even try to explain how everything works at that restaurant and just sent us to the back of the line, then she was being rude and inconsiderate of paying customers giving everyone attitude and the phone had been ringing for a while and she was ignoring it but soon as me and my girlfriend came up to the register to pay she answered the phone to not deal with us because  she knew we were not going to tolerate her bad attitude and some other guy that looked like a supervisor was right next to her and had asked her if she was even going to give me my receipt after paying and the only reason I went from 1 star to 3 is because the waitress that was attending us was polite enough to ask to take our plates and give us refills and had a way better attitude then the girl in the register."}
{"text":"The food is good for the price, $10.95 + drink. The qualify of the food is pretty good. The steak station was awesome, steak any way you want whether you want medium rare, medium, etc... The salad station very fresh.  The service is great, the waitresses come and clean up often and refills your drink for you.  MAJOR CON: The wait is around 2 hours long!!!! Be prepare to wait for a very long time and don't get too anxious once you get inside, there's another 30 minutes wait inside."}
{"text":"Good fresh and tasty food. Wide variety of home cooked food.  Normal buffet atmosphere with a great friendly staff. They were all busy keeping things clean and picked up. I don't think you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"For me the Golden Standard for buffets is the Spice Market in Planet Hollywood-Las Vegas so with that being said this buffet is solid for what it is but certainly not 5 stars. Sunday was an absolute zoo but the line moved rather fast especially considering the line started outside (30 minute wait)! The food was your standard home-style fair (fried chicken, steak, meatloaf, mashed potatoes, etc). This location always has the freshest salad bar. What I enjoy the most about GC is they always have some kind of promotion going on like a Chocolate Waterfall, Seafood Fest, etc. I've eaten here for breakfast a couple times in the past and have always enjoyed their omelet station. The selection is plenteous and cheap and that's exactly what my wallet has been calling for as of lately."}
{"text":"Blech....the food is nasty, everything tastes like something other than what it is and the old people, my God, the old people. I should expect no less since we live so close to Sun City; but for the love of God they are everywhere!! Maybe because the food was so bad that the old people only added to my total dissatisfaction. I will admit that I have a general aversion to buffets  because they kind of gross me out anyway. Most of the time the food is not good, nor good for you and generally the restaurants are filthy-- food on the floor from the toddler before you or the bus persons who just clear the table onto the floor and don't even clean off the condiments that are on the tables-- eeewwwww. So take this review for what it is worth and dine at your own risk."}
{"text":"First time here and generally don't care for buffets. Brilliant layout: Salad Bar from left to right, Brunch, Lunch & Dinner Entrees, Desserts with Amazing Chocolate Fountain!!  Loved it! Great selection!! Good flavors!!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I never really cared for the unkempt feeling of this place but the food and the prices are what keep my family going. Not quite as often as we have before because all the locations we have tried so far are quite frankly filthy. We went on a Saturday night and there were crumbs all over my seat and food under our table. The Chocolate fountain station pretty much always seems to be in disarray but there are a 100 kids running around so that's what's gonna happen. This night was not a good night to rate their food because I have tasted better here before."}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to check this place out along with my girlfriend after seeing all of the commercials on t.v I wanted to see what the buzz was alot about. The line was really long it took about maybe 20 to 30 minutes to wait in line they do allow you to get a drink while in line which is weird because I thought they would ask you what you want bring it to you and give you the refills each time they come by your table but I had no problem with that as I was thirsty especially being in that long line. As for the price it was fair for 2 people $22.95 the place was packed so half of the time it was hard getting any of the food you wanted. The food though was good not great I adored the fried chicken although it was too greasy from my taste but still good. Pizza was real good it reminded me of shakeys pizza and it had the same quality taste to it the fries were good too almost a step up from fast food fries.  The cheese bread was delicous and the baked chicken was good tasted about the same as the fried chicken so really no big difference from each other.  The dessert was good I got the red velvet cake and they have 4 different kinds of ice cream which is nice I didnt try the chocolate fountain but next time I come here I might give it a go. Other then that this place was good nothing to write home about I would still come back as I enjoyed the food and the customer service which I left out was amazing as the server kept checking on us and asking us if everything was okay I like that kind of service."}
{"text":"Why am I even reviewing a Golden Corral? Everyone knows the concept: obese people eat criminally unhealthy things that have been sitting under heat lamps and then finish up at the Font of Pestilence, a sickening fountain of perpetually warmed chocolate that has had the squalid hands of every child to see it thrust in there with the explicit design of inducing public health crises.  Well, I'm reviewing it because when you're trying to eat vegan, your options at the side of the interstate in Gastonia, NC (or most other places, really) are pretty fucking limited, mainly confined to salad and fries, and not hugely appealing. Being able to pile your plate up six times full of nigh-infinite combinations of rice, potatoes, pasta, and cooked and raw veggies for like $12 is a thing one in my situation should neither take for granted nor pass up when offered. Thanks, GC Gastonia, for giving me an affordable vegan buffet option while on the road. You're A-OK in my book."}
{"text":"DINE-IN TIME: Brunch, we went here around 11am and surprisingly it was not as crowded yet outside the parking lot. There was no line.   PRICE: $9 for brunch.   FOOD: A lot of choices to choose from. Everything seemed so fresh because it was packed with people that food ran out fast so they had to replenish dishes often.  BRUNCH TIME DIDN'T HAVE STEAK (BEEF) ONLY PORK.  SERVICE: okay, but I didn't like how they serve customers their drink I rather just get my own  Definitely will go back to try lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"The last time we had been to a Golden Corral was over 6 years ago, when we lived in Tennessee. When we found out one was here in Vegas, we were happy to go again...but now we will never be back. This place was awful. Pretty much every bowl on the salad bar was dirty and even the cleanest bowl still had food residue. When I went to the station to get a plate and some silverware, the very first fork I pulled out had dried, caked-on food on it. The knives were covered in white film and I it took pulling about about 5 knives each  before my husband and I found some that were clean enough to use. The food was also terrible. When I took a bite of the grilled zucchini, all I could taste was the bland taste of the oil that it was cooked with. The BBQ baked beans tasted scorched. The baked chicken was tough and not very good either. My husband had eggs which he said were tasteless, and he couldn't even eat the biscuits and gravy because it was too salty. If I spend upwards of $30 on a meal for two people, I expect to be able to get clean silverware and food that actually tastes like food instead of oil. My husband said that he was glad that it was just the two of us tonight, not only because the cost would have been much higher, but he would also have been embarrassed to bring our friends to such a sub-par restaurant. We will just stick with going to our favorite buffet at the casino for locals...It's cheaper, the food is much better, and the drinks are free with your meal!"}
{"text":"We used to love this place... went for dinner tonight at the Macedonia location.. and it was dirty i mean really really dirty... cost 52$ for a party of four with a 7 year old and 13 year old. The steaks were raw they said come back and a few minutes and then they are all gone.. the food wasn't stocked several bins stayed empty whole night. Dishes were dirtier then usual... and the desert section was shut down completely an hour before closing. The Desert guy used same gloves he was cleaning with cleaner products to serve me ice cream i was so grossed out i left it and didn't take it with me. How exactly is this worth 52$? We used to love this place.. but now we will never go here again. What a disappointment."}
{"text":"Second Golden Corral I've given props to. Very nice atmosphere and very pleasant servers. More expensive that other locations but the food is spot on. I had three steaks cooked to perfection plus three plates of other fine goodies. They serve real ice cream. Not some shit from a machine. Kudos!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not big on buffets, but we were in the area that day and decided to give Golden Corral a try. We got there just before four and were able to still pay lunch prices. Our drinks were not included.   We paid and found a table. It was fairly busy considering the time of day. Initial impression was that it was clean. Staff pleasant. Large selection.  There was a large selection, but some things were better than others. Best thing was the fried shrimp. It was hot and fresh. Worst thing was the dessert selection. Went with the bread pudding. It was inedible mush.  While we were eating, it was getting busier, making it a bit more difficult to navigate and select food.  And then they started with the birthday singing. There were at least two birthdays while we were there. Quite annoying as the singing was loud and overdone.  Overall, we weren't impressed. Food was just okay. Prices high. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"We went there last Saturday At noon for lunch this place sucks the  buffet was empty and l ask the guys  that was supposed to be refilling the bar to put some fresh food out and the all acted like am I supposed to put fresh food out!!! They were totally sorry .will never waste my money on this dive ever again!!!"}
{"text":"Let me warn you. If you plan on coming here and it's a sunny day, bring TONS of sunblock, an unbrella, some beach chairs and a magazine. I waited about 1 hour and 45 minutes OUTSIDE in the smoldering heat to eat here.  The buffet itself is not bad at all. The prices are decent and the food selection is HUGE. I made sure to eat about 5 plates to make my wait worthwhile.  they had steak grilled to order, pastas, veggies, salad bar, pot roast, macaroni and cheese, lasagna.... and the list goes on and on. MUCH better than hometown buffet.  The dessert section is what got me. I'm not into sweets so much, but cotton candy in a buffet?? I took 2 for myself. It was so soft and sweet and made me feel like a kid again. will i return? sure but now I know what to expect during the wait!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has the largest buffet that I have ever seen! Me n my boyfriend ate there  In the evening they had breakfast lunch dinner and deserts. This retaurant has items from Chinese, country foods, pizza enough food to satisfy a person"}
{"text":"I have been to a few Golden Corral's but this one was gross  The prep people preparing the food for the buffet didn't have gloves on was touching his forehead rubbing his nose  The buffet itself was not stocked a lot of food not there  The meatloaf was rare how is that possible  For 25$ I could have went to a casino buffet"}
{"text":"Definitely a great place to go if you want to get sick and poisoned from the food especially the chocolate fountain that kids put their dirty hands in and then lick and put right back in to the chocolate fountain. First time there last time going back"}
{"text":"The outside of the area should have provided a clue to the inside.  The garbage can was overflowing, spilling onto the ground.  This was just outside the south entrance.    The line was not long but it took a while to get through since they do the drink orders at the entrance and then you have to wait to be seated.  This was not a quick or smooth process.  Also there were no trays left at the entrance.  The dining areas was cluttered with napkins on the floor and the tables and chairs had not been thoroughly cleaned.   Not very inviting.  Some of the 'clean' plates had food on them.  The food selection seemed to be extensive until you realized many of the advertised items were missing.  The hot food was not.  Barely warm.  The salad bar area was a total mess.  The dessert area was also a total mess.   There were many young kids roaming around, picking up food with their fingers and putting some of them back.  The ice cream machine was working but not the hot fudge or caramel machine.  Servers were few and far between.   Empty plates were not collected regularly.  We actually put some of them on an empty chair since there didn't seem to be a collection area if you wanted to dispose of them yourself.   They were never collected until we were almost ready to leave.  Overall, not a good experience.   I would certainly not recommend or go back again."}
{"text":"I was about to turn around when I saw the line, but I heard there was always a line and I really wanted to see what all the hub bub was about.  The line went pretty quick and the people I was in line with were friendly and we enjoyed conversation as we waited.  The price is just right and the quality of the food is very surprising.  I thought the quality of the steak would be bad but it was tender and so very good.  All of the fixings and sides were delicious, I especially loved the macaroni and cheese and creamed spinach.  Dessert was good as well, the bread pudding was warm and tasty.  The service was on point, I would definitely wait in line to grub at this place again."}
{"text":"Cooked item on the buffet were acceptable but salad leaves were soggy and filled with water. It is a disappointment to a person who loves to eat salad before main meal. Service for drink was poor we had to wave at our server to get his attention for our refill."}
{"text":"With all the long lines and hype, I finally agreed to try Golden Corral with my dad.  Luckily, the day we went, the line wasn't bad so our wait wasn't long at all! Prices for lunch is about $9, which is pretty inexpensive for a buffet. I was actually surprised at their food selection - they offered a lot more than I imagined!  Salad bar was fresh, and they have fresh ingredients all lined up like a mini grocery store behind the counter for you to see.   The hot food was okay - despite some tasty sounding dishes, the food itself was pretty mediocre. Nothing terrible, but you get what you pay for.  Dessert was average too - nothing that stands out... except for the fondue fountain and cotton candy! The chocolate I took advantage of for myself. I'm not a huge fan of cotton candy, but kids go nuts over it! So I took one for my little cousin, and she loved it.  Place was clean though, and the staff were working hard to get things moving."}
{"text":"Worst food ever. I hardly ever complain but but this was sooo bad that I walked in hungry and walked out sick. I have never ever had such a bad experience.  The service was slow. The facility was a mess. The soda fountain was broken.  Every thing I tried was to hard to stomach.  My brother in law spent about $41 but honestly that is way to much to pay for food that taste like it came from a sewage treatment plant."}
{"text":"There isn't really much to say about this place because I didn't enjoy it that much...but I don't really enjoy any buffets outside of vegas and for the price you paid I guess you get that 2 stars. Regardless...you wait in a long line(I'm assuming due to it's cheap price) and you can get a drink...I prefer you not to get a drink because you don't even get to refill it yourself and it's like 1.99 which is alright but flagging down your \"waiter/waitress\"just to get you another drink is kinda missing the point of Buffet? Anyway I'm not entirely sure on the drinks price but I think my friend paid around $11 for his lunch and soft drink so sounds about right.  Regardless I don't find any of the dishes memorable as they all tasted either too bland or too salty. I honestly don't know if i can really complain about it cause you shouldn't expect much but yea. The memorable part for me is that dessert you get to have cookies and cream, pecan, and 2 other flavors of ice cream and it's unlimited so that's something to look forward to even though it's not the best ice cream you'll ever taste but it certainly beats having only vanilla and chocolate ice cream all the time.  Anyway...my tastebud is spoiled so you can give it a try if you want but I don't see myself coming to this buffet any time soon."}
{"text":"Disgusting. Was seated at a table with food completely surrounding it all over the floor. Every single plate I took from the \"clean\" pile had leftover food in it. You are eating someone else's leftovers when you eat here. This includes the dinner plates, ice cream dishes and dessert dishes, all had food leftovers on them. Staff were restocking the plates, looking at each one and pulling out the dirty ones, about one in 4. I will never set foot at his location again, and likely won't set foot in any Golden Corral ever again. Filthiest restaurant I've ever seen."}
{"text":"Well to start Golden corral is one of my favorite buffets and to see them averaging 2 stars i had to wonder why. I read the all the reviews and thought well maybe these people just hit them on an off day or they were having an off day.I found this location to be not Quite as good as Thomas rd. or Bell rd. in Surprise but still it was no 2 star.The only thing i found wrong with this one was they did not have the stacks of plates by the food instead they gave you a small stack on your table.As far as the food went it was all your typical Golden Corral items.I left there very full and pleased and yes I would return.I hope my review boosts there rating Golden Corral deserves more then 2 stars."}
{"text":"well my trip to this golden corral was well worth the trip.Ilove golden corral and this is probably my favorite one.They had my favorite dishes from there amazing pot roast to the molten lava cake. a few new items were the homemade potato chips were bbq and they also had some breaded chicken livers that were very good and that is something you dont see at any buffet.they also have a cream of potato and bacon soup that is very taste.as far as all the one and two star reviews go i cant figure out the problem these people have..do they not like lots of good food with plenty of choices. Well i hope my review boosts there rating because i love golden corral and i hate to see them get negative reviews because i dont think they deserve them."}
{"text":"Let me first say we have been looking for a reason to drive up and try this, because we have eaten at several GC's in Nebraska when we go for vacation each year (Omaha, Bellevue and Lincoln locations), and it is really a nice place to eat. We have always been surprised at the selection of fresh fruits, veggies, and nice meat options they had, so we figured the CA location should be better, even yet. We did see the reviews, most of which are not so hot, but, decided we would go check it out, and weigh it against the locations we have been to and enjoyed.  1) SALAD BAR - The leafy items (lettuce, spinach, etc) were mushy, and soaking wet from what i assume was water, but, they ended up being soggy and pretty much not edible(i believe its pretty hard to ruin fresh lettuce, and spinach, isn't it?)...Sad when it was simple salad fixings.....Definitely ZERO stars of 5 here.....HORRIBLE! 2) MEAT/VEGGIE OPTIONS - Although these were not horrible, they were horribly disappointing. By this i mean they were simple, basic, and nothing really special that we couldn't have gotten at other buffets. Sadly disappointing. Maybe 2 stars of 5 here. 3) TASTE- This may have been the biggest disappointment of them all - There were 2 options. One was so salty you could barely stand to eat these items (this was chicken, potatoes, Mexican menu, etc)...Just horribly over salted!, The 2nd option, was bland, tasteless food - Like they forgot to add any seasonings whatsoever?? Again, this would rate a ZERO of 5 stars in my book. 4) CLIENTELE - While you expect some big eaters at these type of buffets, i have NEVER seen so many 200 lb women, and 300 LB Men, eating like a bunch of wild rhinos, like this was the first food the had seen in a week....It was a disgusting site to say the least. Not to mention trying to get to the food with them in front of you, they were scooping, eating, burping, etc...I don't want to make fun of anyone, or be rude, but, what we witnessed here, was a horrible scene, and if i could rate this at a negative, i would. 4B) CHILDREN - I don't mind well behaved kids at a restaurant at all, but, there were kids running wild all over this place while we were there. If you weren't careful turning around after putting food on your plate, there would be a kid running by knocking the plate out of your hands, or they were in the line in front of you touching, and tasting the different items......I listed this as 4B, because a lot of the kids i am talking about, were with the food shoveling adults from #4 above. 5) DESERTS - This is where i would have to give a pretty good rating - They do have a large selection of deserts to choose from. After dealing with most of the negative items above, i didn't try anything, i just wanted to get the hell out of this dump before i barfed. My GF decided she would go have a couple of strawberries dipped in the chocolate fountain - Guess what, not a strawberry to be found, and we are in the peak season right now for fresh strawberries, and they are dirt cheap at all of the local super markets.....Disappointing to say the least.  SUMMARY - We will NEVER go back to this location for as long as we live. We went last Friday at about 11 am, trying to avoid the long lines, and have some fresh menu items, before everyone got there for lunch, but, that plan sadly failed based on the above notes. I was more than disgusted leaving this place on Friday, but, i did want to think for a few days before reviewing. You may think my review is mean, and over stated, but, i assure you this is what we experienced at this location. When we weigh this location against the many locations we have visited in the Midwest, this place would barely rate as a garbage dumpster in comparison.  If you do decide to go here to get your grub on, i would say you will get your moneys worth, if you can stand to sit and eat with all of the issues this place has. I would suggest entirely different management, and possibly many or all different chefs, because this place couldn't have been a bigger disappointment, and this is coming from someone who's first stop after the airport in Nebraska is Golden Corral! All of this was on a weekday at 11 am, so i can only guess what its like during a real rush hour, or weekends.....  My real rating would be 1.5 stars, but, i gave it 2 just to be kind - certainly does not deserve the 2 stars in any way."}
{"text":"Located next to BJ's Brewery Restaurant and Mitsubishi Puente Hills Car Dealership. The parking here was pretty difficult, since this place is still new. Due to the new opening of this place, of course, be ready to wait in long lines. The wait time for me was about thirty minutes, so not too bad. However, once inside, the aroma of all the foods made my tummy rumble.   Anyways, let's get to the foodie areas: 1. The Greenhouse Area-Spinach (wasn't as fresh...had some dried up spinach in there), lettuce, organic mix, romaine lettuce, various dressings, cucumbers, half sliced tomatoes (very watery...what happened to cherry tomatoes in salads??), cranberries (sweet and fresh), raisins, canned fruits, fresh fruit, tuna salad, coleslaw, southwest salsa (not as good as the pico de gallo), devil eggs,  various soups (chicken and veggie soup...chicken was dry and the vegetables had no flavor), baked potatoes, etc.  2. The Wok Area-Popcorn chicken, fried rice, orange chicken, fried noodles, egg rolls, etc.  3. The Grill House Area-Pork chops, steaks (where was it?! Only saw pork chops), kernel corn (not too sweet, but fresh), green beans (tasted like it was from a can), mushrooms, brussel sprouts, carrots, mini burgers (DRY! Hard to devour...and the bread was soggy), fried chicken, buffalo wings, tacos (stale), chips (stale),  tortillas, quesadilla, nacho cheese (spicy con queso was a bit powdery, but enough spice), etc. 4. The Piazza Area-Spaghetti with marinara sauce, spinach and artichoke dip, different pizzas, cheese breadsticks (hard to bite through and too much oregano!), lasagna, pot roast (tender, but dry and no flavor), mac and cheese (watered down and tasted like powder), corn on the cob, meatloaf (tasted ok, the sauce was better than 38 Degrees Ale House and Grill), steak fries, mashed potatoes (watered down and tasted nothing like potatoes...), etc.  5. The Lighthouse Bay Area-Popcorn shrimp, tilapia (moist and flavorful), fried cod (breading was horrible, the cod was dry too), etc.  6. The Bread Company Area-Hot and steamy rolls, cornbread (jalapeno cornbread...tasted like cake...not good), and cheese biscuits (dry, but tasted, ok). 7. The Dessert Area-My favorite area! What more can you ask for?! Assortative cookies (chocolate chip cookies was a bit salty), molten lava cake (moist and the chocolate just gushed out), various pies (chocolate pie was horrible..avoid this at all cost!), chocolate fountain (not the best chocolate, but it was ok), rice crispy treats (warm and not stale), brownies, marshmallows, frozen yogurt, hand scooped ice cream (oreo ice cream didn't taste very good, but the rainbow sorbet was great!), and cotton candy (my super favorite, nice and fluffy with loads of flavor)!   The service here was not great. The table that they sat us with had leftover food and drink stains. They hardly cleared the plates, so they piled up quickly. Sanitation wise...zero. They used the same wipe for everything...  Overall, I would not recommend coming here...Only the dessert area was good...I wish I went to BJ's Brewery Restaurant instead...  Note: It's true what they say...\"You get what you paid for.\" So my expectations for this restaurant wasn't high to begin with...first and last time I'm coming here."}
{"text":"First time trying this place here in Las Vegas. I was not impressed at all. First of all its a very dirty place. Second the food is nothing to write home about. Its the grossest ever!!!"}
{"text":"We saw the commercials, we see the giant line outside, and finally... We get to try this for ourselves. It was maybe about 2pm or so, and we were going to grab lunch. Driving home to Walnut, we see the line wasn't too long. It was about a 30-min+ wait to get to the front to pay and get our drinks (yes, the drink dispensers are at the front before you pay) and not too long, we have a table to begin feasting. Don't worry about refills, the waiter/waitress working your section gets those for you.  I'll give them props for variety, there's PLENTY to choose from to eat here. American food, Asian food, Mexican food... I love the fried chicken here, pretty darn delicious. The garlic cheese biscuits were pretty good too. Want to liven up your boring Caesars Salad? Head to the baked potato section and throw a couple of spoons of chopped bacon pieces! Lol! Bacon makes everything better, right? I like the hush puppies (and I sure miss a local Long John Silvers, sadface). All-you-can-drink horchata and agua fresca de jamaica. The only Asian foods I tried were the fried rice and egg rolls... The fried rice is a disappointment - let me tell you, Panda Express does better fried rice compared to this, and Panda's is a heavily Americanized fried rice. Steaks are cooked to order, and you see people preparing and cooking! Pizza and garlic cheese breads are alright. I love house they made slider mini burgers. I thought the ere pretty dry, the chocolate cream pie was ok, not Marie Callendar's quality. Cotton candy, and the scoop-able ice cream seem to be hits, from long lines. And people can't get enough of that chocolate fountain.  Lunch wasn't too bad for about $8+ a person. Don't let the wait drag you down. If you have a big group, might have to split up to get faster seating. I can say for sure that the food was better than what Home Town Buffet has... They have some serious competition/quality to go against.  Thanks, Golden Corral, for lunch! Breakfast looks good, will have to try that sometime."}
{"text":"Honestly, what is the fuss about? I came here today around 2 oclock with my mom because she wanted to see what the restaurant was about since there's always a long line. Thankfully, there was no line around the time i went. Well to begin with, i didnt like the fact that you had to get your own fountain drink before you pay. People were literally shoving me when I was still pumping my soda. As for the price, I paid $8.95 plus $1.99 for my beverage. I was honestly excited about this ayce lunch. When i got my first plate of food, I already knew what I was in for. The food was bland. Popcorn shrimp was okay. French fries were stale, at the same time as being saturated with oil. mash potatoes taste like they came out of a box. friend chicken was alright. The pot roast was probably the best selection i made there. It was soft and flavorful, although there were a bunch of fatty pieces hanging on the meat. The enchiladas tasted plain and it was dry. Really? yelpers are gonna give this place 4+ stars? the food was so bland. everyone was lining up and rushing each other like they havent ate in years. everytime i turned around, i bumped into someone. Oh, that reminds me. The SALAD. what the hell? how can you mess up salad? the lettuce werent dry enough so when i added my dressing, it got all watery. the ranch didnt taste exactly like ranch. it tasted like watered down ranch. horrible. even my younger brother was like \"what the hell, how come this doesnt taste like ranch?\" The dessert selection made it seem like dessert heaven. Too bad it only looked good. It was so sweet. the chocolate brownie tasted off. I dont know, I cant explain it. It just reminded me of the chocolate brownie that they used to serve in middle school. Carrot cake was sweet too. I liked how they had real ice cream instead of the regular soft serve machine. The butter pecan was so sweet, it literally made my tooth ache. I swear, all the desserts were so sweet. After eating it, I sipped my soda and I couldnt even taste it anymore. the cotton candy was hard. i was the first one to grab one when the lady put fresh cotton candy up. i ripped a piece off and had to tug on it like a mothereffer.   its supposed to be soft and melt in your mouth isnt it?!?! i cant even explain how much i regret coming here. after i left this place, i got a massive headache, probably from all the damn sugar i ate. everything in here is NOT healthy. i shouldve gone to olive garden. overall, this place sucks. its a knockoff version of home town buffet.  NEVER AGAIN!!!!  and the only reason why i gave an extra star is because our waiter Luis was extra nice and attentive to our table."}
{"text":"Let me tell you... I will never go back or go to ANY Golden Corral.... the service was good BUT the food was very bad... all was to to salty... cold fried foods... and the steak they advertise was NOT like they said it was... do not go there!!!!"}
{"text":"I love the food good choice for a quick lunch buffet. I can see this place can get busy on weekends but on the weekday he seems less crowded so overall it was a nice experience. Waitress were awesome too..."}
{"text":"Despite low expectations, this place was a Wonderland of gluttonous pleasure. The spinach is fresh, coffee free, desserts elaborate.   The only downsides: waiter kept staring at my crotch, 12 bucks is a bit much, and my blood sugar got waaaay too high.  (easily avoided with the average amount of impulse control)  Best of: banana pudding, spinach, imitation crab, sweet potato casserole, green beans, ice cream, all things chocolate   Worst: Chocolate chess pie"}
{"text":"I can't believe I actually ate here and I actually didn't hate it!!  I am not a fan of \"All you can eat\" restaurants. I hate Hometown Buffet and Sizzler. I barely even like Vegas buffets. The reason why I don't like buffets is either the quality sucks or it's way too expensive.  Well, Golden Corral wasn't that bad. For the price, the quality is pretty good. The price is roughly $10 or less and there's a variety of the usual buffets foods like meats, pastas, breads, mac n cheese, etc. But the quality is pretty good considering you are only paying $10 or less. Their desserts are really good too. They don't have your typical vanilla/chocolate soft serve but instead it's even better! They have cookies 'n cream and hazelnut ice cream!   The lines are long but if you are hungry and patient, it will be worth it at the end.  I don't plan on coming back in a regular basis. As mentioned, I don't enjoy buffets much. I rather eat elsewhere and get better quality foods. Not to mention, I don't eat enough to get my money's worth from a buffet. But this place exceeded my expectations. If I had to come back, I wouldn't be opposed to it. I'd be more open. It's not a bad buffet by any means. Worth a try!"}
{"text":"I think for the price and quality of the food, its a well solid 4 stars.    Paid 12.98 for dinner buffet and had a wide variety of food well over the amount I paid.   one word: wow."}
{"text":"Golden Corral to me is pretty much a step up from Hometown Buffet.  It wasn't anything too special or too great. Overall, it was moderate to me.  Likes: - The variety of food that they have, much more than any other buffets I've been to. They have foods from Chinese, Italian, American, Dessert, Salads, Fruits, etc. - Cotton candy! Brings back childhood memories haha - The ice cream section was pretty neat because you can actually pick from 6 flavors & they have an employee that scoops for you  Dislikes: - Although there was a lot of variety, they were all pretty bland & flavorless to me. - The pasta was OKAY... not enough flavor - The steak was pretty tough, hard to get it down my throat (don't get dirty.....) - The mini hamburgers were cute but the meat was pretty burnt, so I felt as if I was eating charcoal :\  I honestly wouldn't go back here unless I was really in the mood to eat buffet & this was the only one close by ..."}
{"text":"Everyone knows what Golden Corral is, and I'm sure everyone's been there at least once.  Haven't you?  Haven't you?  Anyway, years ago, friends of mine and I discovered that you could get a great Thanksgiving dinner there without all the fuss.  We'd meet up there in the early afternoon, enjoy a nice, hot turkey dinner with all the \"fixins.\"  No cooking, no cleaning.    After cooking Thanksgiving dinner all day last year, I didn't want to do it again this year.  It was too exhausting.  After he stopped laughing (as everyone usually does when I mention it, followed by pity), I convinced my partner to give Golden Corral a try on Thanksgiving.    GC jacked up the price for adults on Thanksgiving to $11.95 or so, but the kids got it for only 99 cents.  Score!    The food offerings this year weren't as spectacular at this Charlotte location as years past at Orlando Golden Corrals, but it was still a good meal overall.  The turkey and ham were freshly sliced, the stuffing was moist, the sweet potatoes were sweet and covered in marshmallows, the potatoes were real, and the steamed broccoli was fresh and green.  Plus, I got to make a great salad and, if I was still hungry, I could have had some soup.  My only complaints would be that there were no cranberries (not that I wanted any, but what Thanksgiving is complete without them?) and the pumpkin pie...just wasn't pumpkin pie.  I am thankful for Harris Teeter having fresh baked pumpkin pie on sale the day after Thanksgiving so we could enjoy some flavorful slices at home. :-)  The next time you find yourself not wanting to cook a full Thanksgiving meal and don't want to pay a fortune at regular restaurants on the holidays, suck it up and give Golden Corral a try.  Just don't expect linen napkins."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now for dinner, the second time was better than the first.  Both times, there was a line extending out the door, and it took about 30-50 minutes to get to the table. As for the food, my favorite is their tropical sauce steak, and grilled to order steak. Medium rare ftw. Their lasagna and meatballs are top picks, also.  They have a mexican section, italian, asian, salad, meat, dessert. Good guac and salsa, I don't recommend the asian dishes, italian was nice.  I know it's stupid to have fries and fillers at a buffet, but man their fries are good!  Super thick and scrumptious with ketchup.  Their pot roast is way too salty. Moving on to dessert, their watermelon and fruits are almost always empty.  Chocolate fondue! Its decent, the strawberries were pretty rotten at one point, gross. They should get bananas.  The usual super sugary pies, and cakes, cookies.  Nice ice cream, bad fro yo. Tasty banana cream pie.   A nice part about Golden Corral is the service. All the waiters were nice, and attentive. They offer complimentary dessert and coffee, refill quickly, and take your plates away with a smile. (:  I think you get your money's worth. I would go once a month or two, because overeating is bad!"}
{"text":"My experience wasn't pleasant.  Our server Jan was rude. Won't ever go back to this location again."}
{"text":"Kids will have a ball here, especially at the desert station.  You can't go wrong by serving cotton candy and having a chocolate fountain.  Come here for dinner.  If you're craving steak, $10 for unlimited steak is well worth it.  Unusually, my favorite thing here is the tuna salad.  I stuff it into one of their fresh baked \"yeast rolls\"."}
{"text":"the wait is at least an hr long!!! it's like black Friday everyday here at golden corral  anyway, the food is okay, there is a line for pan-fried/grill fish. and their steak was whatever.. everything here is average or below average...  my friends raved about this place and i had really high hope for it. and of course i was disappointed because there is a line everywhere and the food wasnt as great as expected  i think my review for this place is biased because i was expecting a lil too much for a $10 buffet. i've been wanting to go back and give it a try one more time"}
{"text":"Good food like always, very clean and not too crowded. Food looked fresh and it was all delicious. Other than our waitress that brought the drinks who didn't look to happy to be there I had a fantastic experience at this location. Can't say much about the weekends but on a Thursday afternoon it was great!"}
{"text":"This is one of few Colden Corral restaurants where the buffet food is hot and freshly made.  The texture of the food was excellent and was replenished before trays were close to empty.  Buffet lines were closely attended to ensuring cleanliness and presentation.  Food was tasty and satisfying.  This particular buffet is managed well and you're lucky if you're within close driving distance to it if you decide to pig out."}
{"text":"Went here on Sunday 4-24-2017  Went with my family and parents.  First stop was the ice machine you get your drinks when you walk in. Big clump of brown ice fell into my cup. I remember ice machines are one of the worst things restaurants neglect. Bad sign off the bat.   Food was okay. Didn't have anything particularly bad. Sat in the back so we could be in a booth. The restaurant was very busy.  Service was friendly and dining area was moderately clean.   There was an altercation between two females near our table. Lots of yelling and cursing. My baby was asleep so it was just an annoyance. Other families got up and relocated due to the foul language. Others stepped in to diffuse the situation. The servers stared at each other dumbfounded. It was apparent they had no instruction for this type of situation. Bad management.   The second time the yelling started the servers took notice and decided to ask? what was wrong. Still no management to speak of. Finally a supervisor came over and just stared from afar hoping the situation would not escalate. I commented that the management would do nothing as they did nothing to that point. The yelling subsided and everyone dispersed.   The third time one of the females came back and started yelling. A group got up and migrated to the middle. Drinks, food, and even chairs were thrown. There was mass hysteria. The female was getting jumped by three others and being pummeled. A few employees stepped in but for the most part the patrons broke up the fight and separated the group. It was only then did I see a sleepy looking manager waddle out from the back. He had a bewildered look on his face as if he was upset to be summoned.  My parents had their backs to the altercation but were terrified. At first chance we evacuated the restaurant. My mother was literally shaking. My baby woke up during the fight and didn't have a chance to eat. It was an awful experience. After it settled down I expected assurance from management, they didn't bother to address their diners. The original people that threw the fist punch continued eating. It was a disgusting display of poor management and apathy. I didn't want to eat there to begin with but rest? assured we are done going there.   *On a side note. The food wasn't awful. Steak was pretty good. Everything else was mediocre. For the price I'd rather of gone to a casino. Also my server was great. She was actually one of the few employees that jumped in to stop the fight.   TL;DR dirty ice, people got in a fight and management did nothing, food was okay, my server was great"}
{"text":"For the most part, the food is pretty good.  They bring out fresh food and keep the good coming.  The down fall is the cleanliness.  Servers will clean stations by stacking dirty and used dishes on one table which, in my opinion, looks horrible."}
{"text":"Well, first of all to all that complain about the place; get real and pull your head out of your asses, you are entering a southern style $12 family buffet. It is a FAMILY buffet, of course there will be kids roaming around. Don't want kids roam around in a buffet? Then dont go to a buffet!!! How hard is that to understand? Second, this particular place is the only golden corral within 100 miles. Feel free to drive to bakersfield or outside san diego if you dont want to wait in line! Also, it is a buffet, people can do what they want when they are waiting for the table (eat if they want). To the crazy lady that says this will spread germs, How will this spread germs? Are they picking out food with their hands? Or are they eating with their hands after pick out food with a tongue? To the guy that expect perfect steak that you ask for; you are asking a grille guy that is cooking 30-40 steak at one time. Some times he gets it right, some times he doesnt big deal?! If you want steak cooked right, buy a grille, get some usda choice steak from costco and cook it yourself!    Now onto the reviews after ignoring the haters.  I have been here three times and it has never dissapoint. You learn to give the waiter/waitress more time as it is a busy place. My suggestion is to visit during the week days and NOT WEEKENDS if you dont want to wait an hour in the line.  Food: i will only talk about why people come here, which is steaks. i am a steak guy, you learn to ask the guy for the steak you want instead of for him to find one for you. Keep in mind this is buffet steak, not your expensive restaurant sitdown steaks. Over cooked or under cooked? Ask for a new piece instead writing stupid review like some negative reviewer here.   The other must have would be the texas style toast! Absolutely awesome and reminded me of the great toast i had in Houston once.  As for the rest of the food, it is for you to find out what you like.  Tips: want to save some bucks? Go in before 4pm for early dinner and you can pay lunch price and still have steaks after 4pm."}
{"text":"POOR customer service! We came here with a large party from out town, guess what? We were greeted with angry faces! Why? Do you not have enough space for a large party? There was a REAL helpful waiter by the name of yunior he was GREAT help! But the lady by the name of Sasha who i assume is ONLY in charge of charging and seating people acted like a total (pardon the french) B**** if you don't like doing a simple task of greeting people and seating them without a stink face and attitude, then why work here? Go work somewhere where you don't have to deal with people. Honestly a second trip here is not something I see in my future. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I was kind of grossed out by the uncleanliness of the place and of the bathrooms. It was as if they turned off the air. Service was slow and it took a while to get refills. The food was not that great and a lot of it had either been sitting out too long or needed to be replenished. I have always wanted to try this place when we come to visit. Now that's out of my system and I can honestly say I wouldn't go back. The only perk of this place was that 2/3 of my kids were young enough to eat for free. Prices are decent, but the quality of food in my opinion wasn't."}
{"text":"Food is what one would expect at this type of buffet.  The dessert selection is a bit more than expected though. The servers are busy socializing while many tables are needing to be bussed or used plates to be collected.  When they do clean tables, it's by stacking all the used dishes on a few different tables in the dining room next to you while you dine instead of taking them back to the kitchen."}
{"text":"First time at this new location. Never been disappointed by GC before, and they still didn't let me down. It took about 15 minutes to zigzag through the line, which is pretty good considering we got there at 5 pm, and we were seated within a minute after paying at the register.  Our server Thomas was fantastic, cleared the used plates quickly and kept the drink refills coming without having to be asked. The lines for the food were very reasonable, and the food quality was very good. The fried chicken was surprisingly good, very moist inside and crunchy outside, not all dried out like some other buffets serve. All in all, it was a very good experience.  My only hope is that they do well enough to realize that they would benefit by opening a few more locations here in Vegas, as it's honestly a bit of a burden for those of us who live on the west side of town to fight the traffic to get there."}
{"text":"I have to give this place three stars since in the end it's just a buffet. Don't come here expecting for gourmet food. You can't really expect that kind of food at ANY buffets. For the price you pay and the food you get, it's worth the money.   The lines here are freaking ridiculous. I happened to stop by here once on a weeknight after shopping with my family at around 8:30PM. There wasn't much of a line, so we were able to try this place out.  The next few times we tried coming with more family members on a weekend...just ridiculous. The line goes out through the door. If you didn't know, you'd think it's Black Friday again.   This place is slightly better than Hometown Buffet, so I'm giving it three stars instead of two. I'm basically comparing this to other American buffets, not those Chinese ones littering the region.   I drove by once when it was raining. Guess what? The rain doesn't deter people from coming to this place: people lining up outside, drenched in water, waiting to dine at this place... It's not like the Dalai Lama is dining here. If he did, he would've gone to Souplantation instead. He's a monk after all.   I suggest coming here either very late or very early. It's not worth waiting for an hour or more. This is just a good place for a once or twice visit, not a place to frequent."}
{"text":"We have been to this buffet twice now.  Once for lunch, once for dinner,  both times the restaurant was crowded and very busy. I think that the tables are a little too close, but the food is very fresh and plentiful.  I love the salad bar most of all!  Very fresh vegetables, lots of choices and very clean.  Even though the servers had a lot of tables, I got plenty of refills on my drinks!  I would definitely recommend The Golden Corral!!!!"}
{"text":"I came in with my handicapped father and not one single soul helped us to the table. Not that it's their job but it's common courtesy. My dad has crutches and can barely walk but we trooped it out and I walked with him every step of the way along with my 4 year old son and my daughter I had holding in my arms the WHOLE time. My father and went to the closest register and the lady called him over to next one and said I'll take you over here I thought to my self do you not see my father having trouble already and you wait till he walks up to the wrong register to actually say something. Then we buy the drinks and the lady walked away immediately she has long black fluffy hair and is kind of chunky looked like she was still in high school or just got out. I had to carry trey of drinks by my self along with my daughter. We proceeded to the closest available table as my father was getting very tired already. The table was dirty but I am a server myself so I had no problem cleaning it off. The server came up to me she was tall kind of heavy set and drawn on eye brows. She told me the table was dirty and we couldn't sit there so she pointed to another table about 10 feet over. I told her we will just take this one my father is tired and this spot is fine she got huffy and decided to clean the table. I asked her if there was high chairs and she said ya up front and then walked away. Guess I have to go grab it my self. I went to go grab it with my daughter still in my arms and went to grab high chair. That server didn't introduce her self to us didn't acknowledge us the hole time except to tell me to move the high chair on this side of table and to fill our sugars up. I can hear her at every table telling them her name and how she will be there server. Then we got switched to another server named Jose and he was awesome and received a tip from me. Even tho it is not your job to help the handicapped and your not getting paid for it doesn't mean u shouldn't help. Golden Corral your better then this and I hope the server I had gets a good talking too about her service because as a server my self she would of been fired on the spot."}
{"text":"Pretty good but prices went up a bit! 13.99 a plate on Sunday! Plentiful choices to make including Prime Rib and steaks made to order!"}
{"text":"Well when we went we were lucky and got spared the long lines the we usually see. The food was good for being a buffet, it was above average. The only knocks I give the place is that the seating is horrible and you feel cramped and it's not the seating either it's also when you walk around and wait in line , u literally have to walk around a few people to get back to your table. The other knock on the place is the waiter, which is more of a buss boy who are suppose to give u refills, the waiter only refilled me twice and each time I waited a long time for those refills. The wait was terrible for my refills I got up and walked to to the beverage station and told them to refill me because I rather do it myself then wait. The place is ok the food was good, me and my family would come back again."}
{"text":"This was our second visit here. We just wanted to make sure our first time wasn't  a fluke. Food was delicious, there was a huge variety and the wait staff were courteous.  This time we had a young man who seemed a bit overwhelmed but he powered through and we eventually got our drink refills.  An enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"I spent a few years in the south (FL/GA/SC), Golden Corral has always been a favor for me when I am craving for fast, cheap and AYCE southern comfort food. Once, or even twice a week is normal for me.  After returning to Cali, I have been craving Golden Corral for as long as I can remember. Before this one, which I can safely say is the ONLY one in the entire LA-basin opens, I have to either go to Victorville or across the border to Kingman, AZ to get a fix.  Before you continue reading my review, I'd like to state I am limiting my review on few items that I consider Golden Corral signature items. I will somehow briefly touch on the other subjects as well to make this review as fair as possible.  I went to the buffet on a Sunday afternoon, as soon as I arrived in the parking lot and saw the line, I actually turned around and went \"LOL NOPE\", then head home. 48 hours later, I was there. No line outside the establishment, nor any waiting inside as well. To put it bluntly, try to visit if on a weekday before lunch/dinner rush if possible.  Most patrons found the drinking fountain provided before you even pay is intriguing. However please be aware, in the south when it's hot and humid outside, the first thing you want to do as soon as you step into a Golden Corral is to grab a cup, fill it with ice and sweet tea, chug it down and sigh in relief. As for the tea they provided at the fountain? I can say it's pretty close to what they provide in the south.  My first plate include southern style cabbage (how much I wish it was collard green), pot roast, mac&cheese, corn bread and some fried chicken pieces in different sauces. The only thing that was close to what I had back in the south was the pot roast and the cabbage. I was very disappointed with the corn bread. I guess it's just difficult to make southern signature item in Cali. Mac & Cheese was alright, and the fried chicken pieces were actually pretty good.  My second plate consist of meat loaf, fried okra, chicken wings (which they advertised on TV), bourbon street chicken over rice. The meatloaf is slightly better than what Hometown Buffet offers. The chicken wings? Well, I'd avoid them. Not they are bad but the fried chicken pieces I had on my first plate was WAY better. The fried okra... I can tell the okra was frozen then thawed improperly before frying. As for the bourbon street chicken? All I can taste was salt and seasoning. No flavor was detected at all.  My last plate had a piece of fried chicken drum stick, more cabbage, a piece of fried catfish and a hush puppy. The fried chicken is pretty much spot on, except too salty. As for the catfish? Surprisingly decent. It is going to be frozen fish but they were able to keep the flavor and the seasoning identical to what they offer in the south. The hush puppy? Well, it was sick as a dog, in a bad way.  I didn't had any dessert. I know even though the offers are pretty close to their counterparts in the south, but for sure they were baked back there. So I skipped the dessert all together.  The biggest problem with most of the food there is WAY TOO MUCH SALT. I'm aware the southern cooking are \"heavy\" compare to the rest of the country, but the amount of salt and sodium in the dishes are just way too overwhelming.   Yes there are kids there, they do run wild, but as some of you said, it's an affordable family buffet, kids are going to be present for sure.  As for the size of the restaurant? It's about average of other Golden Corrals, at least the ones I've been to. Oh and their layouts are almost identical.  Services? Please, give the servers a chance. They have very limited walking space and clearance to work with, while avoiding running into their fellow coworkers and patrons, as they trying to clean up plates and refill drinks as fast as they can. Treat them as how you want to be treated.  Cleanness? It's par. I'm sure the health inspector will frown upon certain things, but you can't expect it to be spotless when there are nothing but constant foot traffic. They do trying to make it clean though. Notice the hand sanitizers at dish stations and a wrist-hook at the restroom doors.  Hype? Well there are some hypes associated with Golden Corral. Then again being the only one around and offers a great price, it's going to be busy.  Bottom line, this Golden Corral is below the par of other Golden Corrals. However compare to other chain buffets? It still kicks the other places in the groin with the price-to-food ratio.  Will I go back again? Only when I'm craving some cheap southern comfort food.  If you want something different with your buffet offerings in the LA-basin, give it a try. Pick a off-peak day and time, and try some southern stuff, instead of the other dishes other places are making (if not better) as well.  The only thing that's missing is the hot and humid thick air brushing against your face when you walk out."}
{"text":"Ate here for dinner with my family today and honestly it was okay. I wasn't expecting much since it's just an all you can eat place with American food but it wasn't bad.   They have a huge selection of foods that range from Mexican to American and stuff in between.   Nothing I tried really stood out to me other than the steaks that were made to order. That was I think the highlight of my whole meal. I like how you can choose how you want it cooked and it was not tough like some steaks.   Honestly it's better than going to a hometown buffet and the reason we chose this place cause there's always a bunch of people and for trying it out it was okay.   Would I go back? Maybe but it's always good to give it a chance and see it for yourself."}
{"text":"I fucking LOVE Buffets.  I really do.  But the food here was so bland.  My god.  Taco meat bland.  Salad dressing outta jar no re fridge type  Chinese food, tasted like my kid could have made better.  I seriously ate one bite of the Chinese food.  So over powered with Soy Sauce.  Complete garbage.  Slider Hamburgers dry and tasteless.  Corndogs lousy.  Even the Mt Dew I drank tasted watered down.  NO JOKE.  The food was so bad I ended up eating fucking watermelon.  Because everything tasted so bad. Now on to the deserts.   Avg at best.  And why do you dip your apples in salt.  Tasted like shit.  I don't know if they don't want them to turn brown before you dip them in the chocolate fountain.  But it tasted TERRIBLE.  Over all this buffet was the worst I ate since Whiskey Petes on the Cali/NV stateline.  And that has almost been 10 years ago.   I was so disappointed with this buffet.  Seriously save your money and go to Old Country for better flavor."}
{"text":"It has finally made its way to CA.  My family and I frequented this place on weekends in TX.  Being that the place is new and much better than the barly edible HTB, be prepared to wait in long lines.  The service was great, the dishes are taken away right away, and your drinks are quickly refilled.   Finally, huzzah for the cotton candy."}
{"text":"This place is great!  Just food was fresh and delicious good selection for all vegetables and meats on the salad bar, awesome desserts and the best dinner rolls a person can ever eat!"}
{"text":"Save your money, do not go here. $45 for three and we were hungry when we left (remember this is a buffet). The absolute worst buffet I've been to. Dirty, messy, unpleasantly smelly... we drove over 20 minutes to try it after all the commercials. Yes, they have a chocolate fountain. One that small children continually stick their fingers into. Mashed potatoes were soupy. Very limited meat selection. Server was very awkward, kept asking us \"are you guys good?\"  One star for having delicious yeast rolls and honey butter. Would not recommend. Will not come again."}
{"text":"I only came because my parents wanted to take our relatives from the UK to experience an abundance of American style food.  We first tried a Sunday night around 6:30pm and there was about 1 hour wait and decided to come back on Thursday night at 6:30pm and there was a 30 minute wait.    For a little less than $12 for dinner, (no drink) it's okay.  Yes its one notch better than Home Town, but they're not that hard to beat.  It is busy so you have to be careful with bumping into kids especially.  Some parents allow their kids to run full speed through the restaurant.    When we got in, they did a quick wipe down of our table but they needed to use better table wipes cause it reeked a bit.  With the heat and amount of people in our section, ventilation was also not that great, which had a little bit of that smell you get when you're waiting in a DMV.    As for the food, they don't know how to cook steaks.  My med-rare was med-well.  They just cut slices off the grill not letting steaks rest... which loses all their juices.  It's a sirloin so probably doesn't matter anyways.   Pork ribs are a huge hit or miss.  Don't get the end pieces because its pork jerky, very overcooked.  Only the center bones are descent.   Fried fish, onion rings, and chicken noodle soup were way over salted. I liked their fried chicken...then again I just like fried chicken almost anywhere. I did enjoy the salad and fruit area, which probably isn't anyone's purpose to coming to this place.  Watermelon was sweet and freshly cut. Hand scooped ice cream was a bit on the sweeter side for me.   Hand spun cotton candy was nice.  I can't remember the last time I've ever had that.   Chocolate fountain had kid's hands going in too far and dipping more than just their food so that wasn't very appetizing.    Staff is nice and friendly and were attentive to us."}
{"text":"The restaurant manager called me and comped For my boyfriends dinner and also mine..he's mailing me two coupons and explained the situation and apologized(in which I appreciate) Of course I will be wary- but I'll return...but I will leave if it's super busy cause I don't think I want a repeat.."}
{"text":"Just OK. Besides 75% of the food being good and the nice customer service, the place looks run down. Reminds me of a hospice or hospital cafeteria with upgraded food. A good interior decorator and remodel would definitely attract a better crowd and turn this place around."}
{"text":"I was a little reluctant to try this place based on some of the frightening reviews. There have been a lot of commercials so we decide to give it a try for dinner tonight. All of the food was good and the meats were fantastic. The floor was a little dirty but not too bad. Our server Alejandra was amazing and worked veery hard.  She came by our table several times to check on us. Our my only complaint is there air conditioner was broken and the dining area was really hot.   Overall it was a pretty good experience for a Golden Corral."}
{"text":"I was dragged here for my sisters going away party...that being said it pretty much matched my low expectations and then some.  This place is absolutely disgusting. The dining area is gross, messy and kids were running wild. The plates and silverware were dirty and sticky. The food made me sick. This place deserves no stars."}
{"text":"I just visited this newly opened location yesterday. I used to love going to the golden corral in marysville washington, when I lived there, so I decided to try this newly opened location. The line of people waiting to get in was almost wrapped around the building. In the parking lot, I had to dodge sticky messes everywhere such as discarded half eaten ice cream cones, and cotton candy. The place is only just opened and the parking lot is all sticky and filthy. Nice. had to wait 40 minutes to get in door, and another 20 minutes to get to the cashier. The atmosphere was overcrowded and unpleasant. The cooks could not keep up with the demand from the hungry animal customers, and most serving pans(troughs) were either empty, or running empty. my wife got a piece of fried chicken which was raw and uncooked on the inside. (apparently the cook did not leave it in the frier long enough. The food was mostly not that good.    One thing that annoyed me was that every 2 minutes a server would be hounding me with questions like \"is everything alright? can I get you anything?    Some might consider that to be good customer service, but I like to be left alone to try and enjoy my meal. I dont like having 2 or 3 servers constantly hovering over me while I eat. After the 10th interruption , I finaly got a bit rude, and said go away already.    Another thing that kind of sucks is that they charge you an extra 1.99 per drink, on top of the buffet price. I can go to several buffets where the price is 7 to 9 dollars and the drinks are included. The servers at other buffets do their jobs, and for the most part, and leave you alone to enjoy youre meal. If you plan on going to this place, one way to beat the system is just bring youre own bottled water.    Golden corral seems to crowd the tables too close together. Over all not an enjoyable dining experience."}
{"text":"With so many reviews I'm not sure what I can add except to say that Golden Corral is a moderately priced, family, buffet restaurant that serves a variety of reasonably good food.    There was about a 45 minute wait to get inside the place.  I was afraid that the line outside might lead to a Disneylandish labyrinth of endlessly circling lines inside but thankfully it wasn't too bad.  The items I had were all fine: steak, meatloaf, mashed potatoes, peas, carrots, fried fish and chicken tenders, chocolate covered Rice Krispy square, chocolate chip cookie.    The lines inside went fairly quick and there was only one line-cutting incident, not surprisingly at the chocolate fountain...  So, of you want an affordable buffet and are hungry enough, it's worth it."}
{"text":"The Food is getting better , can't please everybody , it's a all you can eat buffet not a fancy Restaurant , can't always expect everything to be spectacular , especially dealing with hungry customers aslong as I could get varieties of food on my plate , then I'm satisfied good job chefs !!!!!"}
{"text":"Thanksgiving Tradition at the Golden Corral.   We have a group of anywhere from 5-11 who have been making this a tradition for at least  5 years.  We meet here from Mesa, Scottsdale, South Tempe and Chandler. Some of us do not even see each other the rest of the year, and some who came as guests are now regulars.  This year will be no different, except that I personally will be driving down from the White Mountains so I don't break tradition.  We love the Mesa Golden Corral because not only is it the best meeting place, but we can count on the food and friendly service being excellent. Only once were we asked to leave earlier than usual....not because we were loud, but that particular manager didn't want our group of 9 holding the table too long.  Oh,  and by the way,  it is so good,  we have added Easter to our Golden Corral  Holiday Tradition."}
{"text":"Fatties Reunite at the Golden Corral. When I stepped into this wondrous buffet for which I've commonly seen commercials to but has eluded me thus far in life, I knew I was ready for a surprise. What a huge line of rather obese individuals, couples, and families. I knew that I belonged here.  2 for $20 after 4 pm on Mondays to Thursdays. Oh lord. Someone save me from myself. When I first stepped in I saw a huge buffet, much bigger than Hometown which is comparable, but I think Golden Corral definitely has the edge.  There is better quality meat and food, and the desserts are also pretty good for what they are as well. I love the cotton candy. They also get great fatty points for the Horchata. Service is good, and the place is fairly clean as well.  Skip Hometown and go to Golden Corral weekdays if you feel like being fat and spending only a little money."}
{"text":"It probably could have been a good experience if the place wasn't such a zoo. I mean, having lots of customers isn't a bad reflection on a retaurant, but at a buffett, it really puts a damper on things when you have to wait in line for every helping of food. And I went at 4 in the afternoon on a weekday! I waited maybe 15 minutes just to get in; when I left, the line was much much longer. Not to mention, with so many people, it was really loud (not in a fun TGI Fridays way), an it was hard just to move around (which you have todo a lot of, since it's a buffet).  The food was comparable to the median quality of Hometown Buffet; I've gone to HB and had better food at times, and worse at others. In other words, not terrible, but not that good. They had some special offerings (pan-seared seafood and steak), but if my experience is representative of the norm (which according to many reviews it is), you probably won't get to try them. This is because they make just one small pan at a time, each one taking several minutes. It' like you get the worst of both worlds: you have the wait of a sit down restaurant, except it's a buffet so rather than sitting at your table and having someone bring it to you when it's ready, or even having a number called, you just he to stand in line while they cook and hope you'll be able to get some.  The one thing waiters do bring is your drink, and as one reviewer said (it may have been on Google Reviews), you practically have to beg for a refill. Seeing as how you're at an AYCE buffet full of salty fried food, having them more on top of refills (or having self-serve drinks like Hometown Buffet) would be a big help.  Overall, I had a very unhapy experience. I would like to try this Golden Corral again sometime, but I am hesitant. Some things can be improved (drinks being self-serve or at least refilled reliably), but if there is never a time at dinner (lunch has limited menu) where the line isn't out the door and the place more like a corral than a restaurant, I'm not sure what can be done short of opening a second one nearby."}
{"text":"The pot roast and \"yeast\" bread was really good...however the long wait was definitely not worth it...and it was really crowded on a Tuesday! I thought the line would have died down since they have been open for about 2 months but nope we still waited 45 mins plus for a table!   I rated it \"A-OK\" because its definitely better than hometown buffet more selection and hot food! Seating was cramped but service was good!"}
{"text":"After our second attempt we decided to brave the line. We set the timer to see how long it really took and from the line outside to the cash register it took an hour and fifteen minutes. We actually spent less time in the restaurant. As for the price, it was the same as we paid at Green Valley last weekend for adults (the kids are actually a deal because their price includes their drink).  It cost almost 12 bucks for an adult to eat dinner and then 1.99 for a drink. Senior citizens saved only 80 cents, but still paid the same amount for drinks. The best part of this whole visit was the food, but unfortunately there were too many negatives that we will not return to this location. Maybe when they open in Henderson or somewhere in Summerlin. I thought the location being in a more low income neighborhood wouldn't be so bad, but some of the class of people were ridiculous, with a complete lack of ability to express their feelings with appropriate English language, racial slurs and talking about sexual experiences in line in front of little kids.  I only gave them three stars because of the long wait and the language used by their customers, I would have given them more for the good food and the customer service. All the employees we encountered were super friendly, helpful and nice. I hope they come over to the Henderson or Summerlin location."}
{"text":"I had stopped going to the Golden Corral due to the food and all the little kids who are not supervised by their parents and were coughing, touching and tasting the food.  We went there this past Sunday, March 5th and had an absolutely outstanding breakfast!  The steak was better than some I've had at the steak houses around Phoenix. It was flavorful, lean and extremely tender. The gentleman cooking it obviously knew what he was doing. The other food we tried - chicken fried steak with gravy, cornmeal coated fish, skillet cornbread, hot links, scrambled eggs, blueberry pancakes, bacon, coated bacon, omelets, tater tots were all top quality, fresh, hot and delicious. We sat by the dessert area and were amazed at the number of people who eat so many sweets early in the morning - including cotton candy! There was never an area that was empty. Everything was kept well stocked. As soon as the cotton candy was gone, there was more made and put out. We were very impressed and plan to go again. The key we discovered is to go for the breakfast and go when they first open - very few children!  Glad we gave their breakfast a try again."}
{"text":"Great service at table. Very fast and courteous. Steak griller needs an attitude check or a new job as he was just plain rude to everyone."}
{"text":"Had a taste for steak so I went for a dinner here on Friday night about 7:30pm.  The restaurant was busy and there was staff and customers everywhere.  Everything was fine until a 20 something guy comes in with 4 of his friends and sits at the table next to me.  This individual was wearing a blue terry cloth robe to the ground and bedroom slippers and a tshirt and shorts underneath it.  His friends were dressed normally.  Judging by him being easily 300+ pounds I doubt he was a cancer patient or on his way to death row.   I brought it up with one of the 3 managers on duty and was told there was nothing he could do about it!  Whatever happened to a business having the right to refuse service to anyone?  Even more so someone who doesn't have the grace to dress himself appropriately for an acceptable appearance in front of other people and the children eating in the restaurant?    What a gutless turd of a manager who refuses to take action and act like a manager and ask the individual to leave and come back when he is dressed appropriately.  My faith in humanity continues to dwindle on a daily basis.  I will no longer go to this establishment as evidently they appear to cater to lazy people who can't even dress themselves.  Great job Golden Corral!"}
{"text":"We went here tonight and we didn't have to wait. There was a lot to choose from but unfortunately not one thing I ate was any good. I wouldn't  go again."}
{"text":"I have been to plenty of Golden Corral's. When I moved here my husband and I decided to try this one because it was closer to home. Upon entering the restaurant we felt as though it was not too dirty but definitely not spotless clean. The food is definitely hit or miss. There have been times when we went and the food was great and then there were times when we went and the food was eh. The service wasn't too good. I think our server was so busy talking with friends and cleaning up the same table for 15 minutes that she forgot to refill my drink.  I would say the events they hold are pretty neat. They have madden contest, movie nights and other things. I've never seen that at any other GC. Overall this place isn't too bad. If I may make a suggestion...clean up a bit and teach your servers some customer services skills. Other than that...you're good to GO!"}
{"text":"5 star!! The BEST Golden Corral and so reasonable at 17.64 lunch for two"}
{"text":"Very mean people! Except our waiter, Monique. She was on top of everything and was very nice. I asked the manager a simple question about the hours, she was really rude and gave me attitude. Hostess lady was rude and yelled at us \"Go sit over there, go sit yourselves!\"  Most food was cold and rice was overcooked. Desert was great though!  Don't recommend."}
{"text":"I'm surprised to see so much negativity in many of the reviews. Others that I know, and I have never had a bad meal here. There is a wide variety of items to choose from, all of which are very fresh, and kept at the right temperature.  There is better Asian food here, than in any Chinese Restaurant in the immediate area. High quality ground steak is used for the sliders. The pot roast, turkey, chicken, and taco meat are top grade. If you go for dinner, the steaks are delicious.  Their dessert bar is second to none. Yes, it gets a little messy because you're dealing with toppings and fudge, and customers who are responsible for the mess that they are complaining about!  The staff is extremely friendly, and all of the servers not only work very hard, but they are as effective and efficient as any I've ever seen. Without hesitation or reservation, I'd classify the service as \"exemplary\". In fact I'd venture to say that the servers not only don't get the credit they deserve, but are probably shortchanged by most patrons when it comes to their tips.  Ask yourself this. When eating at a sit down restaurant, does the server make as many trips to your table as the ones here do?  If you want really good food at a price you can't beat, try this place.  To be fair, if I have one criticism, it is that the cooks should not wait until 10 minutes after food bins are empty, to start cooking up the next batch."}
{"text":"I really don't get what all the whining is about. Of course there's going to be a wait. We've been bombarded with commercials, but we haven't had one of these places any closer than Hesperia.  Of course people are going to want to rush the place when it's new.  The same thing happened when a Sonic finally opened in Duarte.  Anyway, I have absolutely no complaints about the food.  The steak was on point!  The service was great for the amount of people present.  I sampled a little bit of everything, but I think the shrimp and steak alone are worth the wait.  ...now let me address a few other things. How the hell are you going to complain about endless steak?!  \"Oh, it's too greasy....oh, it's too fat.\". Your cheap ass came here for the Ultimate 2 for $20, and you know it.  If you want a better cut, go to Houston's or Ruth Chris or something.  Pay that ridiculous price.  Also, the decor...who cares?  Come on, it's a buffet, not an art gallery....or maybe you prefer the Norman Rockwell pieces at Hometown Buffet.  Lastly, don't judge the crowd.  Yeah, I admit, there were a lot of cholos and hynas present, but everyone seemed so polite and patient.  Nobody got ghetto in line or inside.  I really enjoyed the food and my experience.  I will definitely be returning...maybe after the lines die down a little."}
{"text":"Pretty sure the quality of the food has changed over the years. All the meat selections that I tried (brisket, chicken, etc) had this fake liquid smoke flavor to it... It made me feel kinda sick.  Soups were good, but no different and honestly I make better soups. Desserts had little variety for the lactose intolerant and everything else was a general meh.  Probably not coming back here on my own volition."}
{"text":"All the food here was good and the wait staff very polite. I got the lobster tail for my sister and she really enjoyed it.  The chocolate fountains in the desert area were quite nice.  They are a bit expensive, but they give a senior discount.  I'd go back here again."}
{"text":"We went after 5, which is reasonable for people to want dinner even if it's a bit early. This is west valley Phoenix, we have a lot of snow birds who eat even earlier. But the buffet was out of a lot, and what was there was cold and stale. 2 stations had a place for butter; a staple you'd expect to be plentiful but was out. My husband wanted steak, but the worker who cooked at the made-to-order station was too busy talking with a buddy. There was another customer who informed my husband he's been ignoring customers like that a lot. I was disappointed to see signs for dessert choices that looked really good like molten chocolate lava cake, but they didn't actually have it available and weren't planning on doing so. We won't ever return."}
{"text":"it was a busy Sunday. Food could have been more fresh, but again busy Sunday. However when there was an issued management was quick to fix it. Very please with that aspect."}
{"text":"Ever since this place opened up, the lines have always extended all the way out pass the door. So I was never able to give this place a try.  That was true, until a couple of days ago. My siblings and I finally decided to give this place a chance and see what all the hype is about. When we arrived, we were happy to see that the line wasn't long!  Before paying, you have to get your drink first which I felt slowed down the line. We grabbed our cups and my sister's cup had a lipstick stain on it!!! That's disgusting and makes me wonder how well they wash their dishes. She told one of the employees about it  and the employee had nothing to say. Not even an apology. We reached the cashier and she charged all of us with senior discount by mistake. A mistake we only caught after we had already paid. We were led to our seats, and the first thing we noticed was the foul odor coming from the area where the employees refill drinks for you.  The odor made our experience eating here so much more worse.   The food here is extremely mediocre and salty. Listen up folks, if you have diabetes, or high blood pressure you better run for the hills because this place puts a whole lot of salt  in their food and a lot of sugar in the desserts. And for those who continue to eat here, you better be careful!  I am disappointed by the quality of the food. With this buffet, it's quantity over quality. It's not about how good the food tastes, but  how many plates you can eat. I honestly could not finish the food on my plate because it was THAT bad.   Take my advice, don't waste your time or money here! It is spent better elsewhere. I know, \"You get what you pay for.\" but that doesn't mean the food has to taste terrible.  The only reason I even gave this place any stars is because of the senior discount.  I would not come here again!"}
{"text":"This place is OK... Lot's of food for one gluttonous price. But here's the thing- There's lots of it, but none of it is really good! It's just OK. Went there for lunch, about 8 bucks, and salad bar was OK. The only thing I liked and thought was better than mediocre... Pot Roast. Otherwise, it's pretty average, and I'd rather have less of something really good than more of mediocre. I'll pass next time."}
{"text":"Saturday I stopped for a bite to eat by myself but when I got up from my table for the first time with my purse and left my drink and receipt on the table  I came back to three filled glasses and all my stuff gone. I was devastated that I left my table for a few minutes and came back to see it was occupied by other people and the waitress cleared the table for them"}
{"text":"Liked it but you guys to place on closer to my house in the LBC, food was great and the choices were really cool...please get one built out our way."}
{"text":"We used to eat here all the time but haven't in a little while so we decided to stop in the other night. I must say, Golden Corral has made a couple changes in the right direction. They have a few new menu items including a pasta bar with different sauces (which were all pretty good) my boyfriend especially liked the spicy Alfredo sauce, at the fresh seafood bar they will make some delicious shrimp to go with it. They also added a chocolate Fondue fountain that we all loved. They don't bring you baskets of their delicious bread anymore but it's all self-serve so it's almost better, you can grab a fresh warm roll as you want one. My boyfriend and I love sweet tea & theirs is pretty good. All in all we were pretty impressed and have gone twice in the last week."}
{"text":"The restrooms are nasty. The tables were stained with food, the dishes smelled and looked filthy, and not to mention the food is Disgusting ( low quality). Pretty much Everything  is Processed.  If you love McDonald's and Burger king then by all means attend.  If you care about your health and the damage all that process food does to your intestines and digestive system then never go here."}
{"text":"DONT DO IT!!!  This place is sick. Off the top, who's idea was it to offer a chocolate fountain? It was like the babysitter to all the unattended children. All that recirculating dirty chocolate **quivers**  From the time we walked in and smelled nothing but dirty pits in the 25min line, we should've known to just leave. The food was, well, Golden Corral food. If you've been once in your life, you've probably already had everything they have to offer. Maybe eating at Vegas buffets has set the bar high for me, or maybe the food here is just that nasty. Like others have mentioned, there really is only a handful of items worth eating. Did I mention the sticky floors and masses of unattended children? I can't act like I don't like the banana pudding, so there goes that one star. Oh and the cotton candy was fun. Service sucked, environment sucked, and food sucked even more."}
{"text":"Freshly prepared food in small batches and lots of choices. The table service was attentive and the price is right.  Overall, the Golden Corral is very good. There was a good selection of greens and add-ins at the salad bar.  The desserts were varied from pie and cake to hand dipped ice cream. In between the salad and dessert was an extensive array of small batch dishes that were fresh and tasty.  There were several choices of beef, pork, chicken, fish, shrimp etc. You will find a choice that appeals to you. It is possible to enjoy healthier selections as well. I think that you can get take-out and you pay by weight...the food's weight, not yours."}
{"text":"I have eaten at many GCs in the area. This is the best one I've been to, in Matthews. The food is good and fresh. I go about 11:00 AM or 4:00 PM, so the lunch food has just come out or the supper food has just come out. It is always fresh cooked and delicious.   The restaurant is clean and restrooms clean. Watch the tile floor by the bathrooms. They mop these frequently and the tile is slippery. I once slipped and fell, with no apology from the manager (Bill), when I told him what happened.  One tip, when I go for supper, I get there about 10 minutes before 4:00 and sit at the table or get a small salad until 4:00 when the supper food is put out. You pay for lunch and get supper.  Overall, I like GC very much and will continue to go. It is perfect for groups."}
{"text":"Have been to this location many, many times. This time waitress was bad! Normally waitresses are good. This time waitress came by table one time. I needed drink refill and said she would get it. Never came back. I took my glass and got my own refill after 10 minutes. Waitress was no where to be found. Didn't see any wait staff at one time. Don't know what happened. Food was good as usual. Service not so much....."}
{"text":"We were a group of four.... Got seated promptly... Cashier was helpful, and picked our table... We were about to seat but our server kindly insisted to clean our area and she was making sure we had enough drinks. Our son spilled a drink and she got it right away. Overall a good experience and friendly staff. Clean bathrooms. Marycarmen was our hostes. Great job."}
{"text":"We decide to give this place a try as we always saw these ridiculously long lines whenever we passed by.  I didn't expect much after reading all the Yelp reviews and the price is cheap for all you eat. We came at 11:00 am on a Sunday and waited about 1/2 hour to get to our table. The place was packed!  Price was 12 for food, $2 more for a drink and $2.48 for a to go cup.   I have to say the salad bar is pretty good.  It doesn't have the variety of salad toppings like Souplantation but definitely a decent selection. They just don't have iceberg lettuce only, there is spinach and mixed greens. They have grilled chicken to top your salad. So you can get a healthy meal here.   The cooked food was overall okay. I got the steak which was too dry and no flavor. The ribs were okay. The enchiladas were decent.   The desserts were good. I liked their cookies and cream ice cream and the cotton candy. I didn't try the chocolate fondue as I was afraid that kids may have stuck their fingers in there.    Service was good overall, many hard working people, but they have a couple of bad apples in the bunch.   The only major change they need to make is how you get the drinks. You first get your drink right before you pay, but the ice was falling on the ground as people were getting sloppy. Then if you a refill you have to get a server get it for you.  They should have a drink dispenser got customers to get their drink."}
{"text":"Okay I think some of these low star comments are kind of harsh. Really you are comparing a 11 dollar buffet to a 20-40 dollar buffet in Vegas?  You are complaining about the line too? REALLY.  ARE you that SPECIAL that WE arn't allowed to come so you don't have to wait in line REALLY!  Wondering why the line is so long and redonkulous! They've been advertising GOLDEN CORRAL on TV for soo long and we have all checked to see where is it and the nearest one was in Hesperia (on the way to vegas).  I don't know about you but the service i received was top notch even though I came on a Saturday and yes I've waited for 2 hours! And yes I've waited in line for steak (cooked the way you wanted) BECAUSE I'M NOT THAT SPECIAL THAT THE RESTAURANT would restrict the amount of people coming in just because you do not want to wait in line.   Just like any buffet there are it's pros and cons. AND HOW DARE YOU OR HOW CAN YOU COMPARE THIS TO HOME TOWN BUFFET OR EVEN SAY HOMETOWN BUFFET IS BETTER.  For the most part it is a open kitchen you get to see what the chef is cooking.  Everything is pretty clean considering they were running at maximum capacity.  The Grill was the best part. You get to see the open flames in front of your eyes while you chose the cut of steak you want, fried chicken was good too.  I'm not a very picky eater sooo everything that i have tried was pretty good to decent to me. NOTE AND REPEAT THAT I'VE TRIED. THAT MEANS I HAVEN'T TRIED EVERYTHING!  Shrimp was good not over cooked just perfect.  The dessert ahh the DESSERT! COTTON CANDY, Chocolate FOUNTAIN, HAND sCOOP ICE CREAM REALLY YOU STILL THINK HOME TOWN IS BETTER?  I MUST BE A FAN BOY no i'm not im just speaking the truth.  1 star docked off for food being a little bit too salty along with some dessert for being ultra sweet.  (i havent had the salad bar yet)  1 star docked off for the salad bar being too healthy (im just kidding) now you see how redonkulous some reviewer sound like?   Other notes If you buy soda you fill up your own soda in the front and bring it with you to your table. the waitress/ waiters will refill your soda.   The workers eat where the customers eat it didn't but me bug it might bug others.  I think a few of the waitress is really pretty and very helpful too. (lol)."}
{"text":"OMG, been here twice now, I had heard rumor a couple years ago that Golden Corral was concerned about competing with other buffets, Golden Corral far exceeds any buffet at same price, the good turnover is fantastic so the food is always hot and tasty, rather wait a couple minutes than  have it cold. The customer service is great!!!! No worries here!!!"}
{"text":"This place opend on 4/20/12 and a few of my coworkers and i went during lunch.  Food was a lot better than Hometown buffet, but they trick you at the beginning since you get the drinks first thinking its inlcuded in the fee but once you go pay its an additional $1.99..  Went back again a few days later and WOW the line was about an hour wait...i drive by the place everyday afterwork and there are STILL abou 50 people standing outside everyday.  Overall food was great, but is it worth the wait?  Thats up to you!"}
{"text":"I guess maybe it's a management thing.  My GC back home (PA) is a joke.  Long lines that never move, management that doesn't care, filthy bathrooms, staff screwing off and there are completely empty crocks on the salad side every time.  I was surprised by this one.  It was clean, the food was filled and the staff was friendly.  The dessert bar didn't look like a hurricane hit it.  People in the food areas were actually working and no socializing.  Four stars because I think the servers in my section were changing shifts and our server was paying more attention to getting other things done then us, but the girl that took over the new tables in our section was very friendly and helpful, and the steak I got was like rubber.  Cooked on one side, burnt on the other.   Maybe it's an area thing to because there were no screaming kids or kids running wild."}
{"text":"5/14/16:  I'm sitting here at GC for the first time in a long time.   My boyfriend isn't impressed and said he'll never come here again.  Had to look for clean silverware,  people up your backdoor in line for steak, the salad bar is trashed and many of the crocks are empty, like always,  total chaos at the register, we've only seen the waitress once.  The bathroom?   Gross and no soap, only hand sanitizer.  Seriously, it's a gallon jug with a pump in between the sinks.  How can you'd place not have hand soap! ?!?  Do they have any on the kitchen areas?  I didn't even eat that much and my stomach is in an uproar.   This is the last time.   Ever.    Short edit, 5/1/16:  Haven't been to this location in a long time.  By the looks of the recent reviews nothing has changed.  I've really been wanting to go to GC.  Looks like I won't be today.    This evening (Sunday, Feb 18, 2013) was the most disappointing experience at this location.  To start off with, I understand they were busy.  We stood in line for about a half hour before being seated.  They had one young guy seating people, and he didn't seem all that concerned with getting people seated in a timely manner.  We saw empty tables everywhere while we stood in line.  I watched a manager in a green shirt wandering around, but it appeared he didn't seem to concerned with what was going on.  After we got seated, there was no silverware.  After we got through the food lines some, but not much finally appeared.  There was a young man wandering around bussing tables at the pace of a snail while the line still snaked out the door.  The hot food area in the middle was well stocked, but the salad side wasn't much to be desired. Much of the salad items were empty or almost empty, and the one and only guy I saw working in that area really didn't appear to care.  The ladies room.  This was an experience.  One toilet full of who knows what with a plunger sitting in the middle of the mess.  Another toilet seat covered, and I mean covered in urine.  The rest of the stalls where dirty, but useable.  One paper towel dispenser empty, another full but not working.  Hair all over the sink.  Over flowing trashcan, tampon applicator on the floor.  I can came out and the manager in the green had disappeared, I looked because I was going to inform him about the bathroom.  The rest of the time there I never saw him.  The chocolate fountain had chocolate splashed all over the place, covering everything.  No bowls at the ice cream machine (not to mention almost empty ice cream and chocolate sauce.)  The service was eh, but I understand she was busy.  I think this is my last trip to this restaurant for awhile."}
{"text":"Let me just start off by saying, I always, ALWAYS go on yelp before I go to new restaurants. Judging by majority of the amazing reviews, I decided to finally go today with my boyfriend. YEAH, i'm going to make this short and say REALLY? this place is just like hometown buffet. It was super packed (&i know its only because its new & there isn't one near by) but the food wasn't that great. Nothing stood out to me."}
{"text":"The novelty of a new joint and long ass lines at 4 PM raised my hopes like no other. Boy did they come crashing down with my first bite. Not to say it elicited an \"omg this is disgusting\", more like...\"ehh....it's alriteeeee...\".   The steak that everyone raves about? Alrite Mexican station? Meh  Chinese good station? GROSS. Please, avoid at all costs (unless you like less than Panda Express quality) Pizza was whatever, lasagna wasn't bad, corn on the cob was actually above average...chicken (in all forms) was whatevs.   I think the most enjoyable part of the meal was dessert. FONDUE FOUNTAIN? COTTON CANDY? I liked their banana pudding and my sister said their cookies were good.   Overall, 2.5 stars. At $11.49 for dinner, they can probably expect to see me......never. Maybe for lunch!"}
{"text":"When this place first opened 7 or 8 years ago, I actually thought it wasn't bad.  I probably go here once a year, but not anymore now after last night.  All of the food was terrible last night.  It was all dried out, which I was surprised about, because it wasn't packed, but it was busy enough that they should have been making new stuff.  They must have made it all earlier and kept it in the warmers or something.    I was going to get a salad, but the lettuce was black.  Not a little bit on the edges, there were big black pieces of lettuce in there.  It was nasty.  Nice to see how much the workers care about the food they're putting out.  This place has always been the worst for little kids.  There are always a million kids running around, not paying attention to anyone, messing up the buffet.  Last night, there were a bunch of kids over at the chocolate waterfall putting food in it, taking bites of the food, then putting the food back into the waterfall.  That was super nasty.  I told my wife I was never coming here again, and she said that's what I said the last time we were there, but I guess I forgot just how bad it was.   Plus the place isn't really cheap.  With 2 buffets, and 1 drink, it was $26.  You can eat at most other chains and get better food for that price."}
{"text":"My brother took me to Lunch at 11:45 AM last week anb it was terrible -- Salad Bar:  No tomatoes, olives, cukes, carrots, etc  No fresh looking veggies -- looked left over from last night's dinner! Entree Bar:  container of 1 1/2 pancakes left over from breakfast; bacon left over from breakfast; plain noodles labeled \"Shrimp; 1/4 piece of meat loaf (also left over from last night's dinner) and, empty bins.  Very few entrees available and none looked fresh.  Waitress was pleasant and efficient - restaurant was half empty.  No wonder.    Management attention/change is desperately needed here.  Will not return."}
{"text":"So I went to this place for the first time with my wife on 05/26 in the evening. I usally go to Home Town buffet. Before I start, I would like to mention that I can't eat any meat (except seafood).  These are my true and honest findings; -- The wait time from the moment I got in the line to when we are actually seated was 1 hour and 15 minutes!!!!!! No, I am not joking! -- Place is extremely busy and kind of congested inside at some of the \"hot items.\" Watch out for running kids, people walking extremely fast with plateful, and the going crazy looking servers. -- Forget about someone picking up the phone to give any information probably because they are so busy I guess! Do all your findings before you go! -- The dinner buffet was $11.49 per person. Drinks not included. Extra $1.99 for drinks or $2.49 for an upgraded drinks. Kids under age 3 eat free but limited to 2 per family! To go boxes are available for $4.79/lb. -- When you enter inside, you will see glasses, coffee mugs, 32 oz. cup, small size paper cup, soda fountain, some specialty drinks etc. right before you pay. This is extremely confusing and not so right design/concept. People coming in after long wait outside getting confused on if those drinks are free or what. If not free, then some of us (not reading the price board yet) are thinking if it will be covered in the buffet price. If not then some of us are thinking if this is the only chance we have to decide if we want soda and if so, the only chance to take it otherwise we will not be allowed later! -- It is at the register you realized that those sodas are not free, they are extra, and the upgraded soda of $2.49 is for the 32oz. soda cup. The reason for extra charge is that you can walk out of the place having full cup of soda compare to the other regular glass soda price whic you can't take! -- The main grill place (hot item) where they are serving steaks, chicken, seafood items is right when you enter inside after payment. Now that is where it is extremely congested and crowdy. Poor design I think! -- The chocolate fountain, cotton candy, and the ice cream, another hot item place, is also situated at very congested and crowdy place. This is because it is where the plates and utensil station, also located for that side of the restaurant people.  -- Floor and even some of the tables were very dirty. Restroom was OK in terms of cleaning aspect.  -- Almost half of the dished doesn't have name tag on it! This make people like me extremely hard to know which items might have meat in it or not. Yes, there are people behind the counter to ask but they look extremely busy and had to ask twice or even thrice for them to answer. -- The Asian guy at the seafood is extremely rude and unfriendly. Watch out for him. I wish I noted his name down. Anyways, it is confusing at his station because the instruction board says to choose between Tilapia or Shrimp., choose sides, and then finally the sauce. For a newbie like me, I thought I have to say all this to this rude chef. Later, I realized that his job is just to give you the meat part and then right next to his station is where all the sides are, again, without any name tag on it! -- Some of the items were fresh and some of them aren't.  -- Only few Chinese cuisine choices. -- There should be more fruit choices other than strawberry as well as pound cake needs to be available to dip.  Overall, I wasn't too impressed and not sure if I will come back again! --"}
{"text":"Thanks GC for the grand entrance of clothes and boxes and trash behind your restaurant entering the parking lot. What a wonderful greeting entering your business!   Of course grandparents are in town and they want this grand establishment. Even the sign inside says \"rill\". The sign is so old they can't fix the sig to say \"GRILL\"!!!! ! Good lord.  Everyone thinks it's the apocalypse inside running around with colored plates waiting for the last trimmings of stuffing available.   The carpets are dirty and stained. There's trash on the ground all around our table area. What is this place? Oh yeah, it's Golden Corral.  Take my advice. Don't waste your money and step foot in this place. I've done it too many times with family. Just can't seem to convince anyone else."}
{"text":"Great place to stop and refuel.. The foods always fresh and the wait staff are very helpful.."}
{"text":"Decent food for the price.   This place serves standard buffet fare. Everything was pretty warm and tasty. I got my fix for Mexican, Chinese, and American dishes. Too bad I'm gonna have to hit the gym extra hard for the next week!"}
{"text":"last time i came here i noticed the quality of the food is a little different, Not in a good way, everything seemed a little more dry maybe it was just me....   However as for service, sadly i forgot the name of out waitress. Our waitress was flirting with the manager trying to get that promotion, then she went on break. The other waitress couldnt help us cuz it wasnt her area..... AWESOME!!!! Then when i was given a refill they forgot to add ICE!! LOVELY!!!! takes forever just to flag someone down for a stinking refill or ICE that they FORGOT to put."}
{"text":"Better than hometown buffet but still nasty food. They have the chocolate fountains but they use very cheap thinned out chocolate that doesn't even dry on your fruit after dipping. Two stars for the cotton candy and ice cream, that's it. Will never come back to this place."}
{"text":"This place is pretty bad for a buffet. Even for $12 there's nothing really edible here.   If you like Pala and all the Vegas buffets.. even the cheap Asian seafood buffets, this place will not satisfy your tummy and your urge to over eat. I don't think I liked one thing here...   -Dry steaks -Pot roast tasted like dog food  -Soups were salty -Meatloaf lacked flavor -Chicken was okay, tasted like a market's rotisserie chicken  -Ribs sucked, no flavor  Felt super dehydrated eating the food.   Service was good. They came around singing \"happy birthday\" to each table celebrating. Very cool.. They also were very good about picking up finished plates.   Fun dining with friends, but will definitely not be returning."}
{"text":"Fred's Playland gives them two thumbs up. Great overall experience. Especially considering we brought them a bus load. That can be extremely challenging. The service was impeccable, The food was served quickly and it was delicious. The managers Ed & Dwayne were more than hospitable. They got us in and out and we were happy, full and on time. They even gave us our own section. We look forward to visiting again next year on our annual Salt River Trip."}
{"text":"Dirty describe this place well... A shame to Golden Corral chain... As soon that you walk in you will notice the dirty floor and it smells dirty too!! Trash on the floor etc. It looked bad enough to make me walk way. Keep in mind that my feedback is for this specific location. We used to live in Prescott and I absolutely love the Golden Corral over there.   We used to celebrate birthdays and special family dates there."}
{"text":"For what it's worth, up until now...I've never posted a restaurant review Pro or Con. Reason being, we all have our personal tastes. What might be poor to one person, may be great to another. In this case, however, taste has nothing to do with it. It was the preparation that made this experience so disappointing.   For me (and many others), there is nothing better than Baby Back Ribs. When I saw the advertising for the Ribs Special, I was all in. Couldn't wait to try all the different sauces.   Once I got to the serving line, the Ribs looked great. Nice color, sauced very nicely. Looked perfect. That all changed once I sat down. Where the meat should have been falling off the bone, I was shocked to find the meat very well done...to the point of burnt crispy. Putting a fork or knife into the meat...the meat actually broke apart. What wasn't burnt was tough and chewy. To me, I must have just gotten a bad piece. So, I went back up...watched as the cook placed a \"fresh\" slab of ribs on the cutting board. Again, they looked perfect. I had him cut off a section, plus a portion from another piece. I got back to the table...both pieces...dried out and over cooked...on the outside. Once you took away the outer meat, the inner meat was very good. Normally, even if a bit overdone on the outside, it's still excellent. But these were beyond \"well done.\" These were all burnt to a crispy doneness. Completely dried out. The only thing that would have caused this was to have taken refrigerated ribs and placed them on too hot of a grill. The outside burns quickly while waiting for the underlying meat to cook. Ribs need to set out for a bit before cooking in order to ensure an even cooking throughout the piece of meat. There is no reason for us to have had the experience we did. It was excellent quality meat, but so poorly cooked. Hopefully, this was something that has since been corrected.   There was one other thing that became annoying. Every 15 minutes there would be an announcement calling out another \"winning ticket.\" If your receipt number was called, you could go up and claim your prize. It wasn't until leaving that I passed this counter filled with a very cheap assortment of children's toys. Really? A counter scattered with this cheap junk? It's like...no thought or effort was put into this lame idea. This just cheapens the overall impression of what Golden Corral used to be. Put the time and effort into ensuring quality foods and service and you won't need such cheap gimmicks that surely serve no real purpose.   The hot buns, always the best...and is the only reason for two stars. When you fail in preparing Baby Backs, there is something wrong."}
{"text":"I went with my two kids for the breakfast buffet.   This was are first time going to a Golden Corral Restraunt and it will be my last.  The food was not very good and very salty.  Most everything was not very hot.  And yes I know we went to a buffet, even my little kids that are 7 and 9 where not even satisfied with there meals."}
{"text":"Don't bother. .. 2 lunches WITHOUT beverages was $22.00.  Less than a mile away is Boulder Station Bufett, SAME QUALITY and 2 lunches WITH beverage,  $17.00.    Charging  for beverages on top of the admission prices is just pure GREED.    Maybe you should ask the emoloyres at Silver Sevens Casino near the strip what happened to  their jobs in the bufett thus week, due to grossly over pricing their bufett for year's, and their customer count decreasing to just a few."}
{"text":"The name is apt. Once you manage to manuever yourself through a ridiculously long line and get inside, this place is totally like a CORRAL. A herd of hungry people, food on the floor, food on the tables, lines for MORE food. Don't expect a peaceful meal. This place doesn't cater to that. Cheap prices and plentiful food. No wonder Golden Corral opened up near Rowland Heights. Asians love these gimmicks! =P  And with all that being said, the food quality here was good and the desserts were very plentiful. Not your standard buffet desserts.   Steak, sausages chicken etc. All the poultry and seafood (fish and shrimp)  were pretty fresh. The fried shrimps were huge! The breads were great too. I didn't want to fill up on those, but the cheese biscuits and the corn bread was delish. Dessert! Pies, cupcakes (red velvet!), bread pudding, chocolate fountain, cotton candy, ice cream, soft serve, whoa.... And the workers kept pumping these out. Fresh.   My only real complaint is the layout. The station with all the meats (the most popular) was right by the entry way where people were paying and waiting for their dining tables. Sooo crowded with the lines and the people walking through. There really should be more room. Especially if people are carrying plates of hot food.   Save your calories and drink water. I think you can ask your server for a glass of water once you reach the table. Golden Corral tries to lure you to purchase a drink since the drink dispensers are right next to the cashiers. I got the sweet tea. And it was sooo watered down. Drinks are $ 2.50 and is added on top of your dinner price.  Definitely got bang for my buck here. $10.50 for an adult at dinner (not including drink)! Service was nice and helpful. Even with the chaotic environment."}
{"text":"For all of the negativity in the reviews here my expectations were quite low. We came in at peek time. The place was VERY busy. The Buffet was well stocked and the food met my expectations. Our server was a bit overwhelmed but she did refill our drinks."}
{"text":"Old and dirty plates, bland and nasty tasting mac and cheese and mash potatoes. No flavored corn and pretty much everything had no taste except for the garlic knots which are really onion knots and the french toast. If you arent in the mood for one of those 2 things then go to another golden corral or somewhere else. I also didn't like how there was only 2 normal size booths in the whole entire restaurant. Why so many mini booths? We needed a regular sized one for the car seat for the baby. I don't think I want to come back here, I'll keep going to the one on power road instead."}
{"text":"Not too impressed with the food at this chain. I have only been here once before and it was three years ago and the same food items were the best then and now. So, out of 170 items, only six could be considered edible in my mind. 1. The Pot Roast 2. The Stuffing 3. Onions Rings/Hushpuppies 4. Flatbread 5. Chocolate/Peanut Butter Parfait   Everything else was either undercooked (chicken) or overcooked (rice) and the Pot Roast ran out and was not refreshed for the entire 90 minutes after I got my first serving. It is $8.50 for lunch, but for six decent items (two fried) you are better off heading elsewhere."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time tonight to celebrate a birthday! Great food, excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"Alright Golden Corral. There was a lot of hype about this place opening. Am I impressed? No. Am I disappointed? Yes, definitely disappointed.   I arrive there with my friends to see a line going out the door and down the sidewalk and into the parking lot. Yeah it was annoying to wait in line for 40 minutes, but that game me hope that it was going to be good. Usually busy means great. Yeah....fail. We get in and pay, it's kind of annoying that you can't just freely get drinks while you eat. You have to get your drink before the check out and they refill it for you at the tables which sounds like a good idea but service was so bad. They took forever to do refills and took forever to clear out our plates as we finish. The food wasn't impressive either. They had a decent variety of food but nothing was impressive, memorable, or even borderline enticing. The line for the BBQ was really long and in the end the BBQ was bland. Nothing is really that good; it's just passable.   Would I come here again? No. would I rather eat here than Hometown Buffet? No. I did not like this place. With the long lines to get in and for the BBQ, the bad service, and food being mediocre at best, I can happily say that once was enough for me. Maybe even too much."}
{"text":"This place has the best food ever. I love the banana cream pudding pie/cake thing lol. They actually made me like fried liver, and I used to hate liver. I've had about everything (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) and it's all been good af. Some of the bussers though play favorites with their tables. A lot of the Mexican busser ladies only pay close attention to Mexican/Latinx patrons. There was one point where my family and I had to put our finished plates onto another table to make room for our other dishes."}
{"text":"I was wanting to do a Saturday Brunch with a friend for my birthday. This was the only buffet brunch I came across for a Saturday. I had been wanting to check out their buffet regardless since I have never been.    I loved it. The steak and french toast with fruit really did it for me! The sausage was also good. Didn't care for the grits or Chicken fried steak w/gravy. But all in all I had an enjoyable time grazing and talking.  I saw the dessert and chocolate fountain but, I saved that for a future visit after eatting so much french toast with fruit sauces.  Steak was so tender and tasty also. Table service for beverages and clearing was also good. Just wish I lived closer cause I love breakfast food and would go more often for the brunch which is 7 days a week from 7am - 11:30am.  Price includes your drinks and it's under $10 per adult!"}
{"text":"Though the price was good and the server very helpful, the place packs in way too many people.  Went for breakfast at 9:30, they were out of the omelet fixings, so had to wait for those awhile.  And it was just way too crowded.  Good for a large family with lots of kids, but otherwise, don't think we'll go again."}
{"text":"Second visit - first time was about a year ago and it wasn't bad for a buffet place.  This time was down right awful!  Food cold, everything we tried tasted \"off\" scallops the size of peas. We won't be back."}
{"text":"If you want reasonable prices with a variety of food, this isn't a bad choice. You can definitively fill up your belly with many tasty selections. My kids enjoy the chocolate fountain and cotton candy!   Where this place needs to improve is the service. The server was. Dry nice but slow. Played would pile up and I went a long time without a drink refill. Please GC consider having a self serve drinking station like the fast food restaurants. This would help your servers tremendously."}
{"text":"I have never seen a buffet with so many different options to choose from. I'm a vegetarian and still had plenty of stuff I could eat. The server did a great job filling up our cups. She did take a while to bring us some hot sauce but it was busy at the time. They have a ton of options when it comes to desserts as well! This place is amazing. I loved it. My only complaint is that some items were labeled incorrectly and others weren't labeled at all. As long as you get there before 11am you get the breakfast price, which is $8 per person. You can get there at 10:57am and stay until 3pm if you want and it will still be 8 bucks. If you go after 11am the price nearly doubles.   I had the following and enjoyed all of it.  Mac and Cheese Biscuits Pizza Hashbrowns Blueberry pancakes Scrambled eggs Corn cake French fries Tator tots Ice cream on a cone Chocolate pudding with whip cream on top"}
{"text":"This buffet is decent. The food is fresh, some of it bland though. The salad is very good, the mashed potatoes and the baked beans were my favorite thing. Orange chicken is good too. Overall I enjoyed it, nothing special or worth going crazy over. But I dislike buffets in general but this one is actually good."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a good buffet, then look the other way.  This is Las Vegas and there other places that offer a good buffet without all of the attitude.  I have to say that the food was good but it is very unorganized.  The staff themselves seem confused.  To make matters worse, the prices aren't clearly displayed.  Although we came well before 4pm, we were charged $14.99 per person for when they had it listed as 9.79. If I wanted to spend this much money I would have gone to the buffet at Red Rock for better food and service.  Don't waste your time here.  You will be disappointed.  I will never go back and there are couple of other patrons who agreed."}
{"text":"Worst buffet in Charlotte. Good was not at all hot. The pizza was dry. Place wasn't clean. It's not even worth $10"}
{"text":"This place wasn't as good as I would hope for. Steak was really good but everything else was pretty mediocre. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Never thought Golden Corral can be this bad!   We went for a dinner at GC, not expecting the most delicious food in the world or anything, but decent and edible.  There are so many things just soooo bad at this restaurant...  First, the restaurant is not clean. There are spaghetti sauce poured all over the pasta and gravy all over mashed potatoes.   Second, the salad bar was such a mess!!! I couldn't tell which salad was which, they were all mixed with each other. I couldn't eat it....no one ever refilled the salad bar the entire time we were there.    I mean..the list goes on and on..   Mac and cheese were old, soups were old, there was not one clean tong available to grab the food, steaks were sooooo chewy....just bad.  Only thing good was my kids enjoyed cotton candy. We will probably never ever dine at GC in Ohio."}
{"text":"Like another reviewer said, hit or miss. Second time and I'm not coming back. Or maybe I'll chance it??? Let ya know..."}
{"text":"Don't even think about coming here if your a military spouse and or dependent. If your spouse isn't here with their id they won't even grant you a military discount! Disgraceful!!!! Who would tell a military family they can't use their own ids for a discount!!! My spouse isn't even in the country how am I going to have him use his id. NEVER EVER EVER COMING BACK HERE!!!!"}
{"text":"My son and I have eaten here quite a few times and have never had a bad experience. The food has always been great, the place has always been clean and the staff friendly, always ready to help, and on the ball when it comes to cleaning and clearing the tables. There usually is a lot of kids running around but we've observed employees keeping their eyes on them making sure they don't touch and play with the food in the trays. Would advise this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"I hate that I gave this a 2 star rating because I loved this place before my wife found a fly in her salad. After notifying management they just said thanks for telling us and put new salad out. Food was great minus the fly situation. Wish there was another look cation to go to but there is not. Until another one opens I will not be back to the one on Lamb and Charleston."}
{"text":"The price wasn't bad for 3. So that was a good start to any restaurant. Where we sat tho wow was it cold! Just made us eat faster to get more food to warm up. The food at the buffet stations, some pretty good and some not worth even putting on the plate. There was one gravy type sauce on chicken. (Mind you I eat anything) it was by far the worst thing there yuck. I felt bad not eating it bc that's how they don't charge us more by wasting less but wow I couldn't do it. The dessert side of things was pretty good. Never go wrong with my favorite pumpkin pie. Don't know why the rolls or over there but if you want one for dinner head over to the dessert table. The lady handling our area was very nice. It was good to see her talk to others and us other than at a normal restaurant where they just take orders and run. Than leaving you hanging. She was there pretty much the whole time if you needed and refill on drinks or just needed some plates to be outta your way ."}
{"text":"Disgustingly dirty. Everything about this place cries out FILTHY.. Bathrooms are disgusting. Cotton candy was good but everything else was terrible."}
{"text":"Down to just once or twice a year (now) that the \"Buffet Bug\" bites my husband, and with that \"itch\" we arrived at Golden Corral.  Compared to last year, it's not as good as I remember - The line was almost out the door and the place was absolutely jam packed...so more people.  The floor was an absolute nightmare trying to dodge food droppings and plates were stacked high on tables...so not as clean.  Our waitress barely recognized us as our drinks ran empty though promised twice to bring refills...so service was lacking.  Our food was \"just food\" lukewarm in temp and flavor...so suffering a bit in quality.   There were fewer food choices than I recall...so lacking in variety.   On the other hand, it was a Sunday and it seemed the entire city of Gilbert was there!  The best part?  The table to my left.  They were seated before we arrived and remained so as we left.  They were having a \"marathon\" and proved quite entertaining - eating for an entire week on $12 bucks!  Thank goodness for the wonderful buttered rolls!!  I stuffed pieces in my mouth each time I realized it was (hanging) open."}
{"text":"only eat here if you want to have HORRIBLE food poisoning for over 24 hours. my sister & I ended up throwing up for 12 hours straight after eating here & it was one of the worst things we've went through. trust me, save yourself & go somewhere else!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great!   I got there at 8pm on a wednesday and there was no line. We were a party of 5 and seated right away.  The food was good. The plates were clean. And the drinks were endless.. Can't wait to go back!  Umm... yes, quite a few people that were obviously overweight.. ahaha i felt pretty sexy in that crowd...LOL."}
{"text":"Two years later and this place has not changed. Everything is dirty from the floors to the plates and cups and silverware. Even the bathrooms are gross. They have the drink station in the front and you get your first drink while in line. I can't understand how they think this is productive in ANY WAY. If anything it slows down the line. And yes there is always a line. And it's hella crowded inside.   The food is mediocre at best. They have different stations and my favorite was the salad station. That in itself is sad. The salad bar has premium toppings like real chicken and real bacon pieces. There was an Asian station, a Mexican station, Seafood? The Grill, and possibly an Italian station? There was also a small breakfast selection where I got some crispy and delicious bacon.   The line for the The Grill was long, because they are serving up steaks. You don't even get a whole steak, just a small piece and they are stingy with the pieces. I was really disappointed in the steaks because they were soooo gristly. The whole bottle of steak sauce could not give this steak flavor. I had a baked potato and a small salad and was done. I grabbed a cotton candy from the dessert station on my way out too. That was the best thing I ate there. It's not worth the price for $13 and even more if you get a drink. There are far too many buffets in town that are the same price and much better."}
{"text":"This place is so nasty. Floors dirty, tables not cleaned off, the buffet isn't stocked. The staff could careless if they were here. Children at the buffet without supervision. The air conditioning is a joke this place is a told mess. If I could give lower that one star I would."}
{"text":"lots of food that's not too disgusting and buffet-like tasting. good price. breakfast, lunch and dinner are good.  the endless warm rolls with honey butter are so good. mmmmmmm..... expect to feel really, REALLY gross when you leave this place."}
{"text":"I came here for the brunch hours, all I wanted was bacon. The super rude cook was disrespectful and very upset because I asked how long it would take for the bacon to be done. She got smart and told the other cook to tell me ( well she have to wait until it's finished) in the most disgusting voice. Here I am 45 minutes later and I still don't have my bacon."}
{"text":"Oh my word. This place is pretty great. I have been wanting to come since it this location has opened, but was scared of the long lines...and more scared of how packed it would be inside. I finally got enough courage to have a late lunch with my family on Tuesday, and it was still pretty packed!!  But I can see why it is packed. The food is pretty great. My favorites had to be the roast beef (OMG YUM), the mashed potatoes, the pumpkin pie, and the enchiladas weren't too bad either.   I might wait another month or so to go back because of how busy it is...even on weekdays. Do people not work anymore?? I hated to get up to get more food, because I had to be super stealth to navigate around customers not looking as to where they are going, kids running, and employees frantically walking around."}
{"text":"Good food. Attentive servers. Better than the one on 75th and Thomas. They have some boneless pork ribs that are very tasty and not full of fat!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here four or five times and each time the food was fresh and delicious and the waitstaff were friendly and efficient at keeping the dishes cleaned from the table. The restrooms were clean and the dishes and silverware looked clean as well. The bourbon chicken and fried catfish are above and beyond, they are restaurant quality well seasoned and delicious. The chocolate fountain is yummy with a wide range of items for dipping and the cookies come out hot and fresh, nothing beats the freshly baked peanut butter cookies. I like how the buffet is devided into sections, salad, Mexican, Asian, American, meats, Italian and desserts. The fried foods are tasty, especially the fried chicken. Cheese enchiladas and pizza are really good as well, cheesy and flavorful. I really liked the ice cream, it is nice having real ice cream at the buffet rather than just soft serve like many other buffets."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first time here, and I still have to ask, \"what is all the hype about?\" The food certainly did not add up to my expectations. Everyone who's been here have told me that it's basically a Las Vegas buffet. This is no where in comparison to a Las Vegas buffet. Granted, there is a lot of variety of food and can cater to many different tastes, though not sure about that Asian section, but overall the food was okay. Nothing in particular stood out. For a group of 14, they were quite accommodating and the wait was not too long.  Parking was okay, because our dinner time was around 8 pm on a Saturday. Once the line heads into the door, there actually is another \"s\" like shape before you get to the cash register. But before you get there, they do have a drinking fountain and etc set up, which I do find quite odd because there are no instructions as to whether or not the clear cups are for fountain drinks only or if they can also be used for water. A lot of us had never been here before so that confused us quite a bit as some people only wanted water and no soda. We ended up just using the cup and filling it at the water station near the cash register. The tap water did have this weird taste to it, I guess it is because it really is \"tap\" water. If you want a refill of anything, you'll have to flag down your waiter, which can be quite taxing at times.   I only went for the mid-section of the buffet which consisted of corn, fried chicken, mashed potatoes, fried shrimp, steak, and etc. I did not go anywhere near the salad or the Asian section. The dessert section did have a lot of variety and it's nice that they have a \"baker's corner.\" The fountain section was a bit confusing as there were barely anything laid out next to the fountains in which we can use. The lines also were sometimes confusing as people would line up at certain areas only (steak) or etc. The plates also were not very clean, I could feel some grim on there. Overall, I do not think I would ever come back here again. Definitely not worth the wait. The workers were really nice and our waiter was very attentive!"}
{"text":"Golden Corral in general is just not what they make it see on tv bottom line. The only thing I liked about this was the service. Im never coming back here. For $18.00 i literally cant believe it. The food quality is cheap and gross. Took not more then 2 bites of my dinner and the proceeded   To the fruits and sweet section. Even my favorite bread pudding i feel like its so good everywhere I go but not here... It was dry and just eh. And dont even get me started on the ratchetry At this location, even though I know its just the location but still."}
{"text":"This is the best buffet that I have had in Vegas. It was very affordable, variety was good, tasted great. It cost us around $120 for 7 of us to eat at dinner time. Definitely going back. The only reason why I am giving 3 stars is because of the issue below. I went here on a busier day. At the table next to us was a larger family and by the time they were done saying good byes 3 children were on the ground literally rolling around. There wasn't a server in that area for quite sometime that I noticed. On their way out the children were still on the ground and rolled out the section before the mother attempted to pick them up. This is a total liability, someone could have really gotten hurt. I get it, it is not fine dining and the parents should have kept a closer eye on their kids but the servers/management should have kept a closer eye. I have worked in the food and beverage industry and know that it can be very stressful and chaotic but this issue should not take a back seat."}
{"text":"I was so damn excited to see Golden Corral open up in my hometown. There was so much hype and just based on how exclusiveness it blew up. Since it opened, I've \"tried\" to eat there 3 times and every time I've walked away because the line was so insanely long. This last time, I finally had the patience to wait all the way. First of all, parking isn't a problem, plenty of lot room. I'm surprised why they didn't just expand the restaurant and use up some of that parking lot room.  Food wise, home town buffet would be crying. This gave me a slight memory of vegas buffets but I personally felt the quality wasn't all there. I don't know if I will come back by choice, atleast I wouldn't crave this place. But I wouldn't mind going here over home town buffet."}
{"text":"It was ok for me. Definitely alot of options. Would have like to had different options as far as the breaded and fried foods. Server was attentive"}
{"text":"I'm teetering between 1 and 2 stars here, but maybe I'm not a true buffet aficionado.  Don't get wrong, not all buffets are evil. But this Golden Corral epitomizes everything I dislike about them.  I went on Sunday after church (mistake no. 1) and was shuffled through the line where I picked up my drink.  Side note: They have horchata as a beverage option.  I descended into the masses gorging themselves on mediocre food.  The crowds, the loudspeakers announcements that children needed to be accompanied by an adult at the buffets, and the waitress whose first words to me were \"Receipt?\" were a huge turnoff.  Yep, they even check your receipt to make sure no one is pilfering mediocre food.  Refills are hard to come by.  Sure, they have \"Asian\" food, \"Brazilian\" churrasco steak, tacos, fried chicken, and every other Americanized food imaginable, but is it good?  Not really.  I tried both the brisket and the churrasco steak, both were about 50% fat!  The bourbon chicken was overcooked in something more like a cheap BBQ sauce.  The only highlight was the yeast roll and mac-n-cheese.  Even the carrots were heavily coated with butter or oil one. Blugh!  People actually line up en masse for this???    I don't mean to moralize here, but I'd rather be pleasantly full from a quality meal than stuffed with bland, fatty foods served from a trough!  Enter at your own risk!"}
{"text":"I heard a lot of hype about this place. I had friends that really hate buffets (especially buffets similar to Home Town) tell me how good this place was so I had pretty high expectations.  The food here is definitely above Home Town level. You can taste the quality in the ingredients because they don't taste like cardboard; They actually have flavor. Some of my favorite dishes were the Mango Shrimp and Steak. Desserts were very good as well.  Pretty solid for the price but beware of the crowd."}
{"text":"Your manager Barb, IF THATS EVEN HER REAL NAME; informed me that I was not allowed to receive my entire meal in fountain form. SOME PEOPLE are trying to eat healthy and would love, say, an Italian dressing fountain or a veal parmigiana fountain or a broccoli fountain as opposed to have to drink what I estimate was about 80 ounces of chocolate for my dinner. (I'm not including the tomato juice I brought myself.)   I didn't want to get personal but let me speak about my journey: I have not been allowed to use knives or forks or even spoons since I was a child. Mom said I would be written out of the will if I tried again.    So there it is Golden Corral. This is just very insensitive to people like me that adhere to a fountain-only diet. I encourage you to be more inclusive of fountain eaters such as myself moving forward. Man cannot live on wheezing the juice alone."}
{"text":"This is an excellent Golden Corral buffet with little crowd most of the time, and this is the closest location you can find from Los Angeles without any lines at all. Anything west to state of California and Nevada from Goodyear, AZ brings you long lines out the door. Drive down to Bellflower, CA location, and you'll see people fighting for your line, food, and parking. They'll even tramp you down and trip your feet. You have been warned..."}
{"text":"Food taste fresh and clean. I've been here with my family several times and we have enjoyed ourselves each time. Keep in mind that this is not a fancy four star restaurant. It is a great place to bring your family for dinner after the movies or after church."}
{"text":"This is like a glorified walmart food court which they discontinued for a reason! Place is dirty and the back family room smells of urine so can i say not real appetizing. Food is plentiful and of a large variety but the atmospere is dirty, which always makes me question the cleanliness of the kitchen."}
{"text":"Giving this place four stars due to the service I had up front and when dining in. Jose was our server. He was very attentive and friendly. The food of course was also good. Will come again."}
{"text":"The food here was good, but the dessert bar was gross compared to the one in Arizona. Not enough pie!!!! And the pies were \"no sugar added.\" Gross. The only good dessert option was the cookies.  Note: start at the salad bar. Its really empty! You'll understand why when you go.   Service is good."}
{"text":"Very spacious place, though quite cold when we were there (Rand H. Mike C and I came here at 11 am so perhaps they had just turned on the heat). The staff was friendly and the food was nicely presented in distinct sections. As for the food itself, it was mostly OK, although for me it would have been better if they had put less salt on the food. I like that they offered items not found in most buffets, such as asparagus, brussel sprouts, and fresh-cooked potato chips. I would prefer, though, that they would allow us to get our own plates rather than give us a set number of plates when they seat us."}
{"text":"Good food for the most part, attentive staff. It could've been a little cleaner, but at the same time I totally get why it isn't-people serving themselves...my kids loved it and the variety is great for my family's mix of taste preferences. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Visited about a week ago and it was just okay. For the price, variety was nice and the food I tried wasn't bad. It wasn't WOW either though. I've definitely had better food elsewhere.  Now for the kicker, by the time I got  home I had broken out in hives and was having a full blown allergic reaction. Seeing as the only things I'm allergic to include red wine and shrimp/crab, I'm not sure what happened. I am aware there is a risk of cross contamination always but I've never EVER had a problem eating out until I ate here. Not even at other Golden Corrals.  Would probably return to try their breakfast buffet but not for anything else. Their only redeeming point was the mouth watering fresh bread rolls and the fact that they had gummy bears (which I love!)"}
{"text":"I was VERY disappointed with my visit this past weekend.  The only positive was that the food tasted great.  The location was just downright dirty.  There was garbage on the floor in the dining room, tables hadn't been cleaned, and the service was just OK.  It is sad that my husband and I paid $2.69 each for ONE glass of milk.  When I can buy a gallon for less than that, it was shocking to pay $5.38 for two full glasses.  I will never do that again.  I understand charging more for soda, but this was milk....  The bathroom was very dirty as well, trash in the handicap stall was overflowing and scattered on the floor.  It was sad that I saw the manager in the restroom and she thought nothing of how messy it was in there.  The dishes were NOT clean at all.  Every dish I picked up either had specks of food on it, or were obviously not cleaned very well.  I was inspecting the dishes with an employee standing right next to me, engaging in conversation with my husband.  He didn't notice the displeasure/disgust on my face.    We came in for the free meal for my husband's birthday, so I guess I got what I paid for.  Just know that it will be a very long time before I return, if I ever do, it really wasn't worth the free meal.  The last time we were here was for my birthday last year.  At least the dishes were clean on that visit."}
{"text":"This place was great when it first opened but the quality of service and food has definetly dropped since then. I took my kids here the other day and the server didn't come to our table one time until I complained to the manager. I wish this place would step it up especially considering that it's not cheap to go here"}
{"text":"This place has a C grade sanitation score of 78.5. We walked in saw that and walked back out."}
{"text":"Sucks bad selection and not fast on getting the food out.  Server took more than 20 mins to get a refill on your drink and cleanliness wasn't great on the tables."}
{"text":"Went here reluctantly with some relatives and I don't plan on returning either.  13.99 per person all u can eat and the food is very bland. Place was packed. People running around everywhere with screaming kids.  Nothing here impressed me at all."}
{"text":"Don't really know why the line was out the door.  The food was really heavy and I felt like rolling outside  the door afterwards because I was so bloated. Figures, I mean I DID go to a buffet ;)  But in all seriousness it is simply a Hometown Buffet... with a chocolate fountain. Nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"I've tried staying away from here after seeing the crazy long lines from the freeway,  but it worked out for us this time!   No line on a weekday afternoon.   First time to a GC & was pleasantly surprised.  Everything was really fresh & flavorful.  The ambiance is better than Hometown as it is bright & colorful.  I loved that there were people manning the stations instead of someone running around to refill the food.  It feels like an extended Souplantation.  Here are some highlights of the meal:  Fried chicken was perfectly fried & flavorful Fried okra was really yummy Cotton candy was fun to eat Sweet tea is good but a lil too sweet Mini slider was perfectly charred  Not so great items: Chicken soup & Clam chowder were too thick Caramel/Dark Choc/White Choc fountains were too thin, but the apples were yummy  All in all, I'd be back if there weren't a line."}
{"text":"Not entirely sure what the big deal about Golden Corral is, but i guess it's a buffet with super low prices.  I will say that it's good value for money...I mean, $10 and you can eat pretty much anything, including steak?  Yeah, even the old fat kid in me approves of this.  The quality of the food is slightly better than Hometown Buffet, and there definitely are more options.  But for all the hubbub about the steak, I didn't think it was particularly impressive.  Guy cooking it doesn't even know how to cut it.  In general though, the food is good for a buffet and I have no complaints.  Also not a fan of how they structured the steak line...it's pretty much right in the middle of the seafood section.  Can get confusing.  I don't know if I'd come here again though...don't think I can stomach waiting an hour for any restaurant anymore."}
{"text":"Natalie, our waitress, was great. However managers Duane and Ed need a lesson in customer service. Ed lied and said tables couldn't be put together per fire code but a family came behind us and moved the same tables the same way we had them and no one said anything. When general manager, Duane came over, he was more worried about me complaining to his boss rather than making sure his guests had a great experience. In this economy, customer service is everything in my book."}
{"text":"Was really impressed by this place.  High quality food was a surprise as this is a buffet.  Their steaks are made to order and were quite tasty.  These were some of my favorites but I didn't get to try everything: steak, fried shrimp, fried catfish, texas toast and mexican rice.  Their dessert bar was awesome, they had 6 different flavors of ice cream, chocolate fondue with strawberries, frozen yogurt, cookies, and pies.  The salad bar look good but didn't get a chance to try it out.  The service was phenomenal.  We didn't feel rushed and our waiter was very attentive with drinks and clearing plates.  Yes, the line is ridiculously long (we waited an hour) on the weekend and probably wouldn't have stayed in line if it wasn't my niece's b-day.  You're best bet is to go on a weeknight.  I've been told they take reservations on the weeknight but not on the weekend."}
{"text":"Came here and it was packed.  Busier than any other buffet we have been to in Las Vegas.  They have a LARGE selection of choices.  Problem is that the placards that label the food weren't accurate at all.  Sometimes you could easily tell and other times you couldn't.  Tons of kids without adult supervision running around even though they kept announcing it and signs saying not to let your little hellions run around.  We will try again.  Food quality is decent."}
{"text":"We went there this weekend for lunch.  Almost $30.00 for 2 of us for food that wasn't worth it.  Chicken....lots and lots of chicken, I didn't see much else except meatloaf.  Pizza crust was limp and soggy.   Mostly the reason I give such a low rating is the price and both of us got sick afterwards.  We will never go there again."}
{"text":"I'm not a buffet fan. This place is decent. Usually hopping. Even so, those waitresses hustle to keep up with customer needs, and table clearing.  My biggest complaint here is the customers. I have no tolerance for kids running around. Yes, I've considered tripping them. Ooops!  I also am mystified by actions of full grown adults. I saw an elderly man spoon veggies onto his plate, then pull the plate towards him, hold the veggies on the plate, and DRAIN THE EXTRA LIQUID ONTO THE CARPET.  Seriously???   Even with all this stupidity by ignorant idiots, the staff is friendly and upbeat. We go here because my fiance loves it. I tolerate it. The staff makes it bearable."}
{"text":"If you love steak & don't want to spend much this is your spot all you can eat steak .. Line is long but worth the wait if you craving steak .. everything else is average .. Definitely be back for more"}
{"text":"I went for breakfast and I wasn't amazed. I found my self going to the buffet multiple times to try and find something descent. I took little bites of my meal fearing I wouldn't like it. I definitely will not be back for breakfast."}
{"text":"I'm not real sure why people are so hard on this place. We don't have Golden Corral in Las Vegas where I'm from, we just have casino buffets so that's all I have to compare it to. I thought the food here was really above par though. It was good, afforable, quality food, with great service and I'm not quite sure what more you can ask for. Will I be coming back here? Yes, absolutely, probably monthly!   P.S.- The rolls are incredible and taste homemade like they just came out of your grandma's oven!"}
{"text":"Mike W. needs to get a life.  If u do not like to dine with old people I suggest u stick with burger king and McDonalds.  More your style anyway.  I am a fan of Golden Corral and the food variety and taste is on par with any restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"Although it's not a particularly FINE culinary experience, it is definitely an interesting one. Worth checking out at least once for the \"fun\" factor. I personally would avoid any \"seafood\" that isn't fried. It looked okay, but better safe than sorry."}
{"text":"Wow!!!!! Thats all I have to say, I dont want to offend anyone here, so I will just say wow!!!! I will say this, I made an attempt and after being seated I decided NOPE this is just not good. Got a refund and walked out the door. Enter this establishment at your own risk....personally id rather pay a few more bucks and eat someplace NICE..."}
{"text":"Not sure what's so great about Golden Corral and why there was such a long line for this place. For me it just seemed like any other ordinary American buffet. If anything, there are a lot of seats and a chocolate fountain. Food quality is fine, but I didn't really find anything special. I did enjoy the chocolate fountain though! Yumz."}
{"text":"This place is creepy. You enter and pay and are given your utensils. Where you pay is a little island with stuff all over the place inside. I understand they seat you, no one sat us and we found our own seat. So I sat for a few seconds before I went hunting for food. Who ever decorated this place must have been drunk and stuck in the sixties, truly awful. So I went for the food. I started with a salad, how do all of those topping taste the same? I really mean it, how do they do that? The fruit was very fresh and good though. Segue on to the mains, a little Mexican, a little Chinese and all American. All edible but not really edible enough to want more. I did stand in front of the ham for a slice, but the people back there were flipping steaks and look at you and never make a move toward you to carve. It is funny too, they flip and they flip but no one ever gets a steak, weird. Dessert is just pieces of things that look like chocolate or carrot cake, but taste nothing like what the look like. This is a place for folks who want to eat until they puke and not care about what it is that made them puke. Flavour is not a consideration I guess."}
{"text":"Went here today. Can't exactly pinpoint the reason why, but I did. Something about the kids wanting to go or something. Yeah, something like that.  Pros: - Prices are great! $40 for two adults and two kids. - Lots of choices. - Service was good.  Cons: - Nothing was really good. Everything was meh. On the flip side, nothing was bad either.  Random: - There was a homeless person sleeping on the ground inside the restaurant near the entrance. I guess this shouldn't be all that surprising considering the area (beautiful Maryvale!)  Overall, not a bad experience, just not necessarily noteworthy."}
{"text":"Came here with my friend and his family. Gotta try this place out since its all over the tv with their commercials  Food: imagine Hometown Buffet but way better. from the looks of thing everything here is super fresh as in they make it themselves. from the bread to the pasta. I would recommend getting the steak first cause if its busy, which is an always, then there will be a long line but the line moves pretty quick so no worries. and plus they have a freak load so don't worry about them running out of steak. their soups are pretty good too. i myself like clam chowder and this is some good chowder. Fresh bread every so often. everything seems like its cooked on the spot.  Oh and their dessert is pretty darn good. its not something to talk about but hey they got their own chocolate fountain so that's a plus. and they also have ice cream too which they scoop for you so you know that no kids or adult would be sticking they nasty ass fingers in them  oh and their drinks are not self refillable. you have to ask your waiter/waitress to refill them. that's OK.   Service: i got to say for a busy place their service is pretty darn outstanding. our waiter introduced himself very kindly. Very attentive. since its busy it was a bit hard getting his attention but we did get his attention so that's a good thing. They cleaned your tables as quickly as possible so that's a plus.  * every time i would come back to the table all the plates that we done were no longer there, so they did an exceptional job*  Location: im glad that they opened one somewhat near where i live cause before it would either be in San Fran/San Diego which ever it was and another would be at the border of mexico and California. So yea good place.  side note: you get the drinks as you are waiting in line. water and soda are in the same cup but you get charged less for the water. iono if they will notice you getting water and then refilling it up for like sprite or something.  in total the price for dinner and a drink would be about 14.99 exact"}
{"text":"Their was no line which was nice but the layout is confusing. It looks a little more of a let down in person than on tv. Large salad station and desert station but actual food their was not much a selection. Our server Pablo is very polite and is actually why this got 3 stars."}
{"text":"I have been to the  Golden Corral locations in Calif. Utah and Las Vegas and although I'm not a buffet person I am impressed with the amount of food and the selection.  First I must say that there was no line when we got there last night.  I was in shock about that.  But very happy considering that every time we go there is always a line.  With at least a 20 to 30 minute wait.     Last night my family went to for the Specialty night Wednesday is steak and wings.  I was disappointed they only had one flavor wings and I don't like spicy food.  So I had to pass on that.  But I got rave reviews from other people abut the steak.  I liked the Meat loaf and fish and the fried okra.  Still all in all plenty for everyone to find something to eat.  And the dessert bar is a sweet persons paradise.  And now they have cotton candy wow!!! sweet, sweet.  I like that they feature different nightly specials.  And they even have breakfast now.  No more going to the strip for a buffet when you can go here for less and better variety.    I still give it two thumbs up.  And they also do birthday parties and have a room to accommodate you group.  I had one there for my daughter this year and everyone enjoyed it.  Also they bring a slice of cake for the birthday person.  But if you want you can bring in your own cake."}
{"text":"My server is very attentive,  and she hasn't let my cup get empty.  This is my favorite location in the valley because they always have my favorites on the menu.   Meatloaf  Green beans And steak that is actually cooked (Sorry \"pink in the middle people\") You can have your steaks your way here too ;)  Plus all in can eat fresh salad and fruit.   (And cookies with sprinkles ._.)  They always treated Grandma with great respect as well,  that alone goes a long way for me."}
{"text":"10/19/2016 Back to visit family and GC revisited.  Much improvement in how clean the place was/ is, but a female family member commented the ladies room was extremely dirty.  Over all food  good.  Still need improvement of keeping it clean!"}
{"text":"Well, it has been awhile since I have been here. So I thought ahh Saturday , lets go here for something different.  As it turned out, not too good. We got to the check in (to Pay) @ 4:03,that is what my reciept says. Dinner prices start @ 4,we were in line long before that,but oh well, they have to start sometime. Only a few $$ differance.  Anyway, our server was very good, she was always there refilling the drinks,and asking us if we needed anything. It was the food that was a bit of a turn off. It seemed that half of it was cold. All the vegetables , and the gravy. It was steak night,it was so tough you could not eat it. It is really a shame because, I really is a true waste of food. The place was packed, kids were running around unattened. That is not the fault of the resturant though. Because, there are signs everywhere that children must be with their parents or an adult. My girlfriend ,said the  bathroom   was clean, but the smell was outraggous!! Maybe because it was Saturday, maybe it was just that day. But, I think we will pass next time. It is a good deal if you do have a few kids to take,because, they can choose anything and eat a lot."}
{"text":"Do not waste your time and money here!!! You would think they were giving free food the way Everyone kept jumping the line. Disappointing food selection.  Overall not a good dinning experience. Suggest trying a different location."}
{"text":"Disappointing.  Long wait with many people jumping the line.  Good variety of food but most of it was below standard.  My small piece of steak was tender and tasted good but vegetables were cold.  Fried chicken was dry and hard.  Must have been cooked earlier in the day and kept warm.  Many of the stations were empty for long periods including the rotisserie chicken, braised beef/pot roast, lasagna, orange chicken and pizza.  Reasonable deserts and attentive server were a plus.  Come on management, get things sorted out.  Will not be returning soon."}
{"text":"Items mislabeled, not enough selection, Over priced! A lot of overweight customers here. Food doesn't exceed my expectations, I would never recommend this place nor come here again. I don't understand what all of the commotion was about to get one in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Shit this place was a piece of shit that's right I went in I thought I was gonna have to fight some body the staff was rude and lazy the place was filthy the place was run like no structure no management the food was all over the place they make you get a drink first I was just confused $57 bucks for 3 people and we got garbage service this place was just ghetto strait up I saw nothing but rachets everwere made me feel skumy being there dirty dirty beware don't go here you will regret I shoulda just gone else were I screwed up comming here you've been warned ppl here are scavengers the food is not even that good terrible two thumbs down"}
{"text":"Our food tasted fine. Was really dirty. When the restruant first opened customer service and appearance was much better. We waited a bit for a lady at front to even let us in and pay. Never was offered a refill. Food on the floors, the cups at the soda dispensers were all sticky. They don't even let you grab your own forks even more. I've been there when they were much busier and got better service. Food was pretty good though!"}
{"text":"There was a loooooooooooooong line when we arrived for lunch. I dislike the setup inside walking towards the cash register. As you walk in, it feels like you're waiting in line to get on a ride at Disneyland. LoL!  As you walk up, you will come across the fountain drink area and the lady there will ask you how many cups, etc.  From there, you have to fill your drink and then walk up to the cashier. People take their sweet time at the fountain drink so I can see why the line doesn't move smoothly.  NOW the Golden Corral in KINGMAN, AZ. I love how you walk in and the fountain drinks are behind the cashier so they will get you your drink(s) + no line"}
{"text":"Food was good, busy but of course it's Sunday so is every other place. The salmon, bbq chicken and Mexican bread pudding were delish! Our server Edwin was on top of it and super friendly! He checked up on us and made sure we didn't have an empty cup. Great overall!"}
{"text":"Went there last night ,food was ok for mass produced and sitting out. You get what you pay for but what impressed me was we were sitting across from the salad bar so I got to watch the lady take care of the salad area and having a restaurant background she was very sanitation orientated. Never cross contaminating the containers,keeping everything separate and clean. This was a pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"Father forgive me, and my stomach for that matter. I was beyond hungry, the kids were screaming, this was what i thought was the best option. 50 min later im on the toilet crying.  the fact that we got a coupon for BOGO should have tipped me off. Nonetheless, we paid $14 for a meal for 4 people *stomach rumbles* yeah ill pass.  it was about 5pm, normal dinner time, yet the food that we were \"treated\" to at this location seemed to have sat out since about 2pm. The chicken was tough, and dry, not cripsy, not seasoned or even hot. The buffalo wings were sparse. Not even french fries out?! what will the kids eat!!! we managed to get my toddler to down some mac and cheese, which was mac and lumpy cheese, i felt horrible having him eat it.  I made the deadly mistake of eating a steak, a steak from golden corral is like eating a human in the desert, its lumps, and bloody, undercooked and hot, no flavor what soever. The pizza had the cheese basically jumping off the dough in an attempt to kill itself. the pepperoni looked like it had been there for days. The cooks didnt even have gloves on, our waitress was rude and her eyelashes kept falling off, i just prayed they didnt end up in my sons mac and cheese.   Needless to say i will never in my entire life come back here, stale food, undercooked meat, overcooked chicken, empty dessert bar, bad staff and service. i learned my lesson and will be suing valpak for that BOGO coupon that subjected my stomach to this atrocity.  never again satan!!!!"}
{"text":"The food was really trash honestly, paid 40$ for two people and the food was terrible plus the waitress was terrible too!"}
{"text":"I've eaten there many times and I didn't see dirty plates or tables.  I go during the day for the senior discount so maybe that's why it isn't so busy.  The food is much better than some of the mom and pop restaurants I've been to, which has  the really tasteless food."}
{"text":"Food at golden corral realy good as for buffet food a lot better than Hometown buffet.  Food here is always turning over fast.  And service personal are very quick and helpful the only problem is lot of people.   The steaks are good and tasty. Just make sure not to get well done or it too dry."}
{"text":"When this place first was built it was the place to go in the area. The food was always fresh and fantastic in which now only about half of it is. It was a lot more of a family friendly place to, in which it still is but that has died down consisting it is in a retirement area of Mesa. Now when I go which is usually with a family member who lives in the area, the food isn't that tasty as it used to be and the whole place is filled with sloppy overweight people, in which not to be rude makes me lose my appetite. One thing you can't go wrong with is there dessert section which hasn't died down. The carrot cake, cupcakes, brownies and pies are all still amazing including the fresh cotton candy that was added to GC."}
{"text":"I expected Hometown Buffet, so I was hugely pleased by some aspects, and largely disappointed by others.  Overall, it was great.  I'm worried that the pros won't last past the first year, though.  I went weekday afternoon (before 4).  It was under $9 a person, and then another $2 if you want a drink.  It costs a bit over $10 for dinner, but they are doing a M-Th 2 dinners for $20 deal, I believe.  First impression: the most frustrating opening set-up I had ever seen.  The have no space between the cash register, drinks, and wait to be seated area.  It is a cheap buffet-- you are going to get huge groups and families.  The cashier told me to get my drink, before he rung me up, but I couldn't reach the water that was all the way in the front because there was a party of 8 waiting to be seated, there.  Cashier eventually let us through without getting our drinks first, but that meant we had to wait until the waitress noticed we had two empty cups of ice before asking to get us more drinks.    I understand the concept.  You want people to choose their drink as they wait to pay, and sip while they wait for a table.  Then you want the waitress to bring drinks to ensure water customers don't try to fill up at the drink bar.  They did it wrong, though.  There is not enough space to breathe at the  entryway, and there were two cashiers and two parties (mine only had 2 people in it).  That is sad.  SALAD Bar: OMG better than Souplantation!  They have such fresh veggies, refilled all the time, manned by a couple of attendants.  They do not have the variety of Souplantation, but they have some options Souplantation doesn't have.  I got baby spinach with slices of fresh tomato, crisp bell pepper, slices of onion, pickled jalapeno, guacamole, and salsa.  There were like 3 types of salsa strewn about.  It was awesome.  Then I got a deviled egg on the side (just a hard boiled egg with paprika, it looked like).  You can see the supermarket fresh produce sitting near the salad bar.  I was impressed.  I expected this to be a mainly meat buffet.  The MEAT: Don't get me wrong, they definitely have meat, and it's grilled in front of you, and you can get fish or shrimp cooked to order to eat on its own or add to your salad, pasta, or what have you.  I got the steak.  They are good about having medium rare.  It's not that overcooked under the lamp stuff you get at other buffets.  The steak was really fatty.  Half my piece was fat.  I had to wait in line for it, too  =(  I recommend you ask for double what you want to eat, just in case.  The steak is kind of tough, and slightly on the salty side.  The BBQ chicken was delicious.  It just fell off the bones.  The fish was pretty good and tender.  The sides for the meat are good, too.  They have a bell pepper onion medley, sauteed mushrooms, onion rings, and what not.  The Prepared dishes: There were some good prepared dishes.  I recommend the Bourbon Chicken.  It's well seasoned.  Everything I tried was average to pretty good.  I was happy.  The DESSERT Bar:  One thing about Hometown is I avoid the dessert bar like the plague.  Or I might get some soft serve.  I tried the desserts here, though.  They have ice cream, and soft-serve.  It is your generic ice cream (kind of tastes like Ralphs/ Kroger brand cookies and cream).  They have a cotton candy machine!  It was fun.  They have okay desserts.  The red velvet cupcake was still warm when I got it, unlike the disgusting overpriced POS I got at Sprinkles a few weeks ago.  AVOID THE BROWNIE AT ALL COSTS.  I nearly chipped my tooth on that thing, it was so hard.  The fudge was softer.  They also have a chocolate fountain, and some fruit, marshmallows, or cookies you can stick in it.  The heart cookies were cute, but they were out by the time I got to it.  It wasn't meant to be.   _____________________________________________________ Bottom line: There are some things they need to work on, but if they keep this up, and keep it staffed as they do now, this place is a great value.  I will be back."}
{"text":"The food was wonderful. Went tonight to celebrate my mother in laws birthday. The staff was very polite and helpful. The bathrooms though were very disgusting. I went to the ladies room. One seat had throw up on the seat from a child and the mother left it there. The trash was over flowing in each stall. People seriously need to learn to flush! Other then that everything else was great."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time. The food was cold and tasteless. I was ignored at the \"fresh egg\" station,  while all the minorities were served because they spoke Spanish."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. The tables and floors are always dirty. There is also a weird smell on the west side of the restaurant. The staff is friendly but a little on the rough side looks wise. The food is either over cooked or cold and stale. I would suggest spending your hard earned money on the Chilis across the street."}
{"text":"The day has come in which Southern California has a Golden Corral within a reasonable driving distance!  No more drooling over those enticing commercials only to go online and google that the nearest Golden Corral to be 100 miles away!    After having had both lunch and dinner here I think I can say this buffet is a better version of hometown buffet, but nothing THAT special.  Maybe I've just been spoiled by all those Las Vegas buffets.  What I don't like about the place:  First off, I don't like having to start off at the drink machines and carry my drink while waiting in line.. then carry my drink all the way to the tables.  And then when at the table, when I run out of soft drink/coffee/tea/water I need to flag down a waiter in order to get a refill.  Why?  Because once inside the actual buffet, the only dispensers are operated by servers only. fail.  Second, the actual buffet area is poorly designed.  I never know who is in what line because often times lines fuse together.  Third and most importantly.. A lot of what golden corral advertises on t.v. is not at this restaurant.  perhaps because this is just starting out?  But i felt the selection wasn't as great as it should be.  What I do like:  Even though a lot of items go fast, all you have to do is let someone know, and they'll be nice and try to replace that item as quickly as possible.  The servers are friendly as well as the buffet staff which makes for a nice dining experience.  Food is what you can expect of a standard buffet.  Some items taste better than others but nothing is going to blow your socks off.  Just decent food for an okay price.  All in all, would I come here again?  Sure I would but probably at the same frequency that I visit someplace like Hometown buffet which is really 2-3 times a year if even that.  There is no reason that people should be dreaming about golden corrals anymore.  Here it is folks, and believe me after stopping by, this isn't something you will be craving for."}
{"text":"After seeing the commercial on TV, I finally got to try this place.  I kinda hesitated when I saw the reviews on yelp, three stars still better than Hometown buffet with only two.  When I saw the line, I was thinking how long it will take.  However, I also convinced myself that if the food wasn't good, there was no reason for people to wait in line for so long.  Right?!  The wait wasn't that bad, it was about 25 minutes I think.  They have a variety of foods and they were yummy!! I like the roasted chicken so much, it was juicy and soft.  It cooked just well!! The clam chowder was pretty good too.  Their foods are very decent and I really enjoyed it.  (I'm very picky)    The desert section was pretty good.  They have scopes of ice cream provided to you.  I tried the cookie & cream, it was soo good.  The best thing is they have cotton candy for you in just seconds.  I really liked that.  The beverage was $1.99 each but I didn't know until I paid.  Because I saw everyone was getting a drink. LOL.  But they are refillable so it's reasonable."}
{"text":"This place is da bomb! Just like with all the other reviewers, this is the next best thing to las vegas. The food is so much way better then hometown buffet. If you enjoy american food buffet this is the best place to go. Dessert was da bomb.  lots of good food and friendly atmosphere. I love the chocolate fountain and ice cream. The beef rib was always gone every time i came back for seconds. This is not a place to go everyday, maybe once a year. Lots of big people here, who loves to eat good food."}
{"text":"I was disappointed to be honest. My husband had been to one in Tennessee and told me about how they made steaks to order and it was this great food for a decent price. The Las Vegas location did not have the steaks and I found the food only adequate (except the fried chicken which was very good). I'm rating it low because the furnishings we're so cheap and not clean. The silverware had soap stains and was so light weight they felt meant to be thrown away. The plates seemed like dollar store quality. The carpets, tables and chairs were just as cheap. They did have a fun looking desert section with a chocolate fountain and fun things to dip in it. There was a cotton candy machine but it didn't seem to be being used. The bathrooms were nicely tiled but it was not clean in there. The employees were beyond polite and the best part of the place but I just can't seem to get over how cheap the furnishings were. It was like being in a large Jack in the Box seating area only worse. I would have rather had plastic throwaway silverware then the cheap dirty metal ones provided. The cost was affordable. We were there for the 7.99 early bird special. We both did a drink upgrade so our total for two with tax was $18.36 plus tip."}
{"text":"So so buffet items. Some times the food is great some times not so much. They keep raising their prices, may as well just go to Outback since you'd pay about the same. No hurry to come back just whenever the mood strikes."}
{"text":"It's okay everytime I went to get something it seemed to be out but then replenished by my next time around....the food quality was also just okay nothing to write home about...prefer the Golden C's back in Cali"}
{"text":"So me and my family decided to try Golden Corral after my long day of work . Soooooo..... The moment I walked in I was discussed The food and the place was dirty !!!!! The lady that gives your drinks was eating while she was making your drinks , best part of it all was the manger was walking around eating corn on the cob ! Like he was at back yard bbq !! So unprofessional as manger !!! I will not be returning!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Golden Corals in Kingman-AZ and the one in St. George-Utah few times and I liked it, but the new store in Vegas wasn't as good as the others I've been to. Not sure exactly what, this one was very crowded for a Monday afternoon at 2pm, maybe 10 mins wait in line. The atmosphere and the type of customers resembled the one I saw at CiCis Pizza. I think I'll pay extra 5 bucks more for a real buffet at the MResort."}
{"text":"I've heard good things about this place, besides for the long lines of course, so I thought I would give it a try. My BF was there earlier and waited in line so I was lucky I didn't have to wait that long. We came on a Friday night around 6 and the place was super packed already. It took us about 15 minutes before we were actually seated. Dinner was $11.30 Monday-Friday and $12 over the weekend. Drinks are an additional $2.  As for the food...they have a... Salad bar:  Salad bar was okay. Nothing special about it. You can create your own salad with any topping you could think of or they have a pre-made ceaser salad. They also had 2 different types of soup that day, chicken noodle and chili. They also had your typical potato salad/mac salad/ and stuff like that so nothing really stood out about their salad bar.  Mexican/American/Italian/Asian food: they had a variety of different types of food, but none of them were too my liking. I'm not a picky eater. I'll try everything once, but the food was just...boring to me. They had your typical orange chicken, kung pao something, quesadilla, onion rings, pasta, fried chicken, pizza, fried shrimp, and more.  Grill area: around the grill area they had toast, fried/popcorn shrimp, stuffing and of course the steak. My BF got a steak on his first plate and it was cooked just how he wanted (medium rare) and it wasn't dry at all. He liked it so he got another one and that one came out super dry that he couldn't finish it. But the steak in my opinion wasn't that good. It didn't have any flavor on it at all.  Desserts: they had pies, cakes, the chocolate fountain, cotton candy, and ice cream. None of those things really stood out to me either. I had to get a marshmallow covered in chocolate though, but the strawberries were so tiny and didn't look appetizing at all. Ice cream of course is always good and I've never seen a buffet with rainbow sherbet so that made me happy. And take the cotton candy before you leave!  Service: It was good actually. Better than most buffets I've gone to. Plates were taken away pretty quickly and drinks were refilled when we barely drank half of the cup. Seeing how crowded the place was, I was pretty surprise with the service."}
{"text":"the most nastiest restaurant i have ever been to the food is so bad the meat  is petrified rice way under cooked the selection is very unappealing do your self a favor avoid this place at all cost the dishes are half washed sometimes i dare say eat at your own risk sorry but last time my family and i ever eat here i only selected one star because i had too. and the ice cream machine does not work as well"}
{"text":"I've never been disappointed with food at a Golden Corral restaurant, and can say the same about this location. It did get a little packed while we were there but it was expected for Sunday at mid-morning. If you come on the weekend like we did, I would anticipate waiting in line for a few minutes upon entering the restaurant."}
{"text":"This is the second chance we have this place. We loved the location in kingman, az but this place is like completely opposite. The service was ok at the table but horrible from cooks. It was impossible to get them just to make fries instead they were standing around enjoying conversation with each other. The carpet is the dirtiest I've ever seen in a restaurant. There are too many things to list wrong with this place which is obvious that management is very poor here. Food seemed really old and it seemed like they were annoyed we were there to eat because we were there an hour before they closed. We called to check before we went if they would still have fresh food out but they didn't we were lucky to find food out all together and they basically closed everything 20 minutes before their listed closing time and dished out dirty looks like it was really time to go. Do disappointed that i wasted my money here felt like I got robbed."}
{"text":"Adam our server was very pleasant and very attentive. Food was good. Service was excellent!"}
{"text":"It's a buffet and its 11 bucks ... You can go either way here ... Really picky and eat okay or go for bust and pig out on all sorts of food ... Food is good and price is reasonable ... Waitress deserve tips they really have a lot of table messes to clean up after all the kids and families that eat here .   Don't be cheap ... Tip your wait staff !   *^*^*^*^*^ So the Golden Corral isn't really cheap any longer .... the price went up 3.00 .. though quality didn't really change.  Can't even get a deviled egg dinner . Once the bar plate is empty / don't think anyone there cares to refill stuff.  A lot of the Food was over cooked due to sitting too long. No one was updating bar food .   Not worth  $15.00 + tax"}
{"text":"Been looking forward to eating here due to their commercials and have to say it was the nastiest buffet I have ever tried. The food was old and cold. Will never in life eat here again!!!!"}
{"text":"My family went on a Sunday. The line was long, but it was worth the wait. Food was delicious!! Everything was made fresh and the wait line to the food went fast. We are planning our next trip."}
{"text":"Ah... buffets... America's unbiased food troughs.   This place has it's Pros & Cons..   The WAIT:      A quick tip if you're debating about coming here.. If you want to enjoy it on a weekend or holiday expect a massive line (extending outside and snaking through the parking lot) I went here once at 11am with co-worker whom paid.. at that time there was no line. However, returning the next week at 1:30pm on a Sunday and the line extended further that i could see into the parking lot. NOT WORTH IT! Go to hometown buffet if you're that hankering for a buffet.. no line.. ever..  The SELECTION:      It's a good plethora of mediocre foods that will have something for everyone. If you want to taste the majority of the world's cuisines all on one plate, you'll like this golden corral. Much better than hometown buffet. Plus, the serving area is always clean.  The FOOD:      Well, Las Vegas has spoiled me on buffets, sadly. However, this food isn't too bad. Here are some things that were quite lack-luster but overal all it was decent. The food rarely sits out long due to the hungry hordes of people whom devour it as soon as it comes out so no worries about old food.   My Opinion:      This Golden Corral is alright. It is nothing I would write home about or punch my grandma over, but for a buffet it would a pleasant experience. I would come here again? Sure, as long as the line to get in wasn't longer than a ride at disneyland."}
{"text":"Last night was probably the best food i had at Golden Corral ever. Yet how do I give 2 stars and not 5. Because management is just bad. Late shift manager has a \"I don't care attitude.\" I understand that its busy but come on show some courtesy. There was one lonely kind server named Jose, everyone else was just cold stone at 7 at night. You go for the the food of course but you need to have customer service along with it.   Favorites: corn bread pudding, fried chicken livers, smokehouse brisket (which i think is temporary) but wow it was delish right there with BBQ restaurant brisket level"}
{"text":"Everytime I'm on the 60 Fwy and saw the long long time for this place, I was dying to give this place a try. On a random Monday night after shopping at Costco, we decided to give this place a try since there was no line. (finally yay!)  ok, don't let the long long line fool you, this place is great if you are super hungry and you don't know what you feel like eating it abour $10 per person. The only thing that was decent was their bread section since it was super fresh out of the oven, everything else, was meh.....  it is way too crowded so I was getting a bit of a headache.  I don't think I will be back grubbing myself here anytime soon."}
{"text":"This place sucks! Long line to get in, you have to pay for drinks, and no variety. The price here is not even cheap at $13 for dinner. They offer like 6 types of tasteless chicken wings, a few sides, a salad bar, and a few mexican items. Their desserts also tasted like they made from an expired box mix. The only redeeming quality that gave his place 2 stars would be the freshly cooked steaks. They tasted pretty good, even though the person serving them cannot tell the difference between medium rare and well done."}
{"text":"Went there today for breakfast after a meeting with my wife.  Really not a fan of this location to begin with, but sometimes we think it may be better than Ihop.  The items on the buffet did not appear to be fresh, and as usual the establishment had a dingy, unclean feel to it.  The waitress was never around I think we got 1 total refill between my wife and I.  Maybe this place would be better for dinner, but we have only had breakfast there.   One would think that it is difficult to mess up breakfast."}
{"text":"OK, ladies and gentlemen, usually I am not a golden coral buffet fan ,but today was their prime rib night and I ate like a killer whale. For 13.99 I ate and ate and tried to put a dent in their beef but couldn't. It was good enough to tell everyone that likes prime rib that they should try it when you have a taste for beef. Oh yeh! The fried shrimp were great too"}
{"text":"This is one place that lives up to the commercials.  The steak was really good. Also the salad was fresh. Even the seafood was tasty."}
{"text":"I went here the other night with my wife. The price for the dinner buffet is $11.99 somewhat okay, but you have to pay for the drink separately which will run you about $2.39 cents. So, our total check was around $31 and some change. Not bad, $15 - $16 dollars for two people.   Pros: The food was okay, there was a lot of people during that time so you had to make sure to get in line to get your food. The steak was probably the best food choice I had here second to that was the fried chicken.  Cons: The place is dirty and the restroom was 10 times worst.  Could have anyone picked up a broom and swipe some of the dirt and food on the floor? We apparently sat on a table where no server was stationed. So we had to get our own refills and we even had to tell one server to pickup our plates. I understand people calling in and being short staffed, but someone should have told us that this table was unattended.   I gave it 2 stars because the food wasn't that bad.   IMO please clean up the place especially the restroom and let the customer know where not to sit."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this location a few times now and the food always tastes good if you can get it fresh. I used to think it was the time of day, but we have tried Afternoon and evenings still the same. I've noticed they cook large amounts of food even when they aren't busy so the food sits. The other thing is they just pour fresh food on top of what's already in the hot table."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  Paid too much money and the quality was poor.  No managers in site.  Running out of things and no one cared.  Where was the salmon?"}
{"text":"Just had lunch here yesterday. The food wasn't the best tasting you could tell it was very cheap. example: canned peaches. But it is very cheap and you can stay as long as you want. Me and my family stayed for about 2 hours talking and getting about 3 big dishes of food each. There was a server that kept refilling are drinks that was very friendly. I notice a lot of the strawberries were spoiled that they put out but u just have to dig in there and find the good ones. The chocolate was my favorite. They have a chocolate fountain. Overall it's not bad for really filling yourself up for 9$ just don't expect much out of the food quality, a lot of the food was to salty for me."}
{"text":"Attention Golden Corral AND the two GC employees that we dealt with at this location -- the one star that I am forced to leave for my experience here is too good for you. I would leave you a -10 stars if it were possible I am down-right horrified by the events that have taken place in the past two hours. Forcing myself to avoid vulgar language in this review is almost too much.  To get right to the point, tonight my boyfriend and I went to this location for dinner (just past 7:00). We paid about $30 for the meal (yikes) and then did the whole select-your-food-buffet thing. Within about 10 minutes of sitting down with our first plates of food, we discovered that the piece of chicken on our plate was raw inside. My boyfriend had eaten a bite and when it didn't taste right, he went in for a closer look. Indeed, despite how it looked on the outside, it was still pink and gooshy on the inside. Ewwwwwwww.  We immediately stopped eating and brought this to the attention of our waitress (Kim). The response that we got? \"Eh, that happens sometimes. I'll pass it along\" Literally, this was the response.  Uh....I'm sorry, what?  We thought maybe she was having a rough evening/ didn't understand the severity of the situation, so we spoke with the manager (Cathy), who said \"Eh, we'll have them pull that pan.\" When we waited for more of a response, she simply smiled at us and then walked away. ZERO concern shown for the fact that we had already CONSUMED some of this raw chicken. Absolutely infuriated, we couldn't bring ourselves to eat much more and we left.  Halfway home, both of our stomachs did flip flops, and upon returning to the house, what should happen? You guessed it. Violently sick to our stomachs. So, now, I feel awful AND had to pay for it? Not acceptable.  About a half an hour ago, I made the mistake of calling Golden Corral to address this issue. I asked to speak with the manager, and, Lucky me, Cathy again. When I told her what was going on and asked for a refund she cut me off and rudely snapped \"Well, you know we can't do that.\" I responded that this was unacceptable (in an effort to give her a second chance). Nope. Cathy then says that no refund is possible, and they \"take classes on this sort of thing, and it is impossible to get a food-borne illness within an hour.\" She then recommended that they only thing that they can do is encourage us to go to a doctor if we're not feeling well.   I couldn't help myself Yelpers, I laughed. This is one of the most ABSURDLY HORRIBLE customer service interactions I have ever had. And...it gets worse... Cathy then goes on to tell me that she recalls dealing with my boyfriend at I, and that our complaint had nothing to do with the food, it had to do with a dirty spoon.  Nope. Wrong again. That complaint was two tables over from us. We definitely had an issue with the raw chicken, not the spoon. When I tried to explain this, Cathy interrupted me again. I finally said that I would call their corporate office, and she snottily got off the phone.   Yelpers, I am absolutely sickened by this entire situation. Run, don't walk, as far away as you can from this place. If not for the potential food poisoning, then from the genuinely rude customer service and sub-par dining experience.  Hopefully, my concerns will be more appropriately addressed this week when I reach out to the corporate office."}
{"text":"My niece and her friends were there to eat early this afternoon and she shared her experience with me. I feel that it is something to be addressed. Here is what she experienced today in her own words: \"I went to the salad bar and was going to put raw spinach on my plate when I noticed a dead moth in the spinach, I told the lady behind the bar, she gasped then took the tongs and pulled the dead moth out, and then put the same spinach and tongs back in the salad bar for people to eat! I was dumb founded and grossed out, but did not know how to address it or did not want to make a scene on the account of the people I was with.\" I have noticed in many of the other reviews that a common complaint is the \"Dirty\" and unsanitary condition of this establishment. Because of these reviews and my niece's experience, I have no desire to eat here, I will not be recommending it, and I may even contact the Department of health."}
{"text":"Love their mashed potatoes lumps and all,  they are real!!!  I wanted a fried chicken wing,  I couldn't get one the last time I went,  everybody wanted those wings so they disappeared right away,  get a clue...I don't think many people want tthose dry chicken breasts.  Love the green beans too, they may be from a can but they are doctored up very nicely.  At breakfast time the ham,  the oval shaped kind is so very tastety, you better get it fast, it disappears quickly too.  I only go to Golden Corral when I am starving."}
{"text":"I used to work here at this location and let me tell you... Aside from being dirty and gross, everyone is in the WORST mood ALL the time and the general manager sucks. At least the one who was there when I was did. You people think front of the house sucks... It sucks in the back too lmao. Literally the only good thing in that restaurant are the steaks and fried chicken."}
{"text":"There is something for everyone in the family...,steak is great, fish also..,,and the cotton candy!"}
{"text":"The manager Mika is a jerk!!! He has no respect for customers horrible horrible service my son was eating a raw cheeseburger he was such a jerk to us!!!"}
{"text":"Long lines!! this place is horrible , its so sad to see so many people hungry, you have to stand in long lines and get pushed & shoved on by other people just to get a plate. They need to open more restaurants to stop this. It's smells bad you can smell the kitchens bad Oder. I seen kids putting there hands through the chocolate fountain... Gross!!"}
{"text":"Lots of food for a very low price Getting sick right after eating said food, priceless."}
{"text":"Yep, 3 stars that is what they deserve. Why? Because, it's not like \"OMG DELICIOUS CHEAP FOOD\" but \"hey this is better than Hometown Buffet\" type of food. Be prepared to wait if you go for lunch or dinner but the customer service are pretty quick about trying to find a spot for you. Grab your drinks first before you pay is a bit awkward because there is a cash register while you are holding your drink, and you are standing in a messy crowded line waiting to be seated.  Food is decent. They have everything you can think of. They have seafood (fried), Mexican, Chinese, Italian, pizza, different types of meats (turkey, chicken, beef [cooked the way you want], ham), a very nice salad bar (which no one really touches) filled with different types of greens, meats (bacon, salami, pepperoni), croutons, nuts, and dressing. Small soup bar which had Calm Chowder and Chili. Finally, they have a large dessert bar which has cookies, pies, cakes, fruits, a cotton candy machine, ice cream, and the chocolate fondue which you can dip either a marshmallow or a strawberry.   Even though they do have a large variety of foods, I think depending when it comes out will determine the quality of food after all it will be sitting under a heat lamp.   Do not expect the food quality to be GREAT but edible. The Turkey and meat can be dry. Ham can be salty. Chicken will either be salty or savory. Fried items can get hard or greasy. Chocolate fondue does not use real chocolate as it had that cheap no-name brand chocolate flavor taste and the cotton candy quality was lacking as the texture was rough and hard. REAL cotton candy melts in your mouth and when you touch the cotton candy on the stick or bag, it should feel soft, fluffy, and soft not rough, hard, and pebble-y. Like I said before, it's not top notch quality food but a decent place to come grab a meal with your family (that's picky about food) on a weekday / weekend.   Props to the customer service. Even though they were busy, they were not rude even though you can tell they looked annoyed at the crowd, they refilled drinks, and constantly kept the area clean. From the staff in the back/ kitchen wiping the bars to the front cleaning tables and vaccumming the floors. Also, a lot of families like to come and eat here which means a lot of children running around!"}
{"text":"first off, this place has lines out the door come dinner time. my brother and i waited in line a good 45 minutes just to see what all this hype was about. standing in line reminded me of the lines at disneyland. long, slow, and definitely not worth the wait. the selection was alright. service was average, once they sit you down, you never see the waiter again to fill up your drinks. just the guys that take your empty plates away. food was forgettable."}
{"text":"If you're going to venture to Golden Corral, plan accordingly. Make you sure you have time to wait in line to be seated and come hungry. This buffet rivals the Vegas buffets and blows Hometown out if the water. The food is fresh, tasty, and the variety will please all tastes. The service is also attentive, keeping drinks filled and tables clear of used plates. I'm glad the opened this location in LA County, I can't wait for one to open in the OC (fingers crossed)."}
{"text":"Ok,  change the oil in your fryer,  chicken tasted burned but didn't look burned,  the pork chops were fried so hard I never did get to taste it.  Canned green beans which I sully lov had bee sitting too long or were over heated, step it now."}
{"text":"All I can say it sure is better then my wife's cooking. I also love to see certain people load their plates so full the food falls on the floor and they pick it up and consume Go on Sunday after church and they have dresses that glitter and men have bright colored suits. It's better then star treck"}
{"text":"I'm a fat boy so I love Golden Corral. Not to much to say the staff was very nice the location was clean and laid out better than our regular location back home in  Baltimore."}
{"text":"Very very dirty. The concept is nice but this place is very nasty and there was hair in my food TWICE! I understand this is a family establishment but the amount of kids running around is a complete turn off. Also like the other comments stated the service to get refills is very poor. I think I waited 15-20 mins from the time my drink was empty for a refill. Mangers just stand around a look dumbfounded. I highly recommend they put this in another area as well."}
{"text":"Extremely pleased. Service was on top of everything and very polite. Food was hot and fresh and steak was dead on every time we went up for more. I will definitely be back. Sooo freaking happy they opened a golden corral finally in town."}
{"text":"The bf had been wanting to come here ever since it opened so after a trip to Disneyland one day we decided to go.  This was my first time to a Golden Corral and he had been to the one in Victorville so he was excited that there was one close by.   It's your typical buffet. Full of people and busy. What I like about it though it you get more bang for your buck here no doubt. Forget Hometown Buffet! That place is a rip off anyways with mediocre food!  Golden Corral exceeded my expectations as far as what they had to offer and then some. They have a friggin chocolate fountain!   So if you're in the area and don't have high expectations for a buffet go here. :P"}
{"text":"The food is alright. It's a hit and miss whenever I dine in. Good customer service though."}
{"text":"For the price and the variety of items it's definitely worth it. Minus the high sodium! Plus the fresh cotton candy and DARK chocolate fountain!"}
{"text":"My guy and I ate here on Jan 3, 2016 around 6pm. There weren't many open tables and we had to seat ourselves.  There were kids running around in the restaurant and almost bumped me to where I almost dropped my food.  There were rude people and kids without manners.  It was loud and some plates were dirty.  The staff and managers were busy cleaning around buffet food and keeping the buffets stocked with fresh food.  The ladies restroom was surprisingly clean.  There were many food choices, however, most of it wasn't very good tasting. The steaks were tasty. and we waited for Well-done  The french-fried onion green bean casserole was delicious.  Pleasant surprise you could have cotton candy in bags to take with you.  The meatloaf was a disappointment and tasted horrible.  Thankfully we bring our own plastic ware to eat our food with since the clientelle there were gross people.  We think we got sick with colds and bronchitis from eating here"}
{"text":"I was really impressed with the friendly atmosphere. My waiter was very attentive and had a great attitude concerning his job after working 11 hours."}
{"text":"We've been to the Golden Corral for breakfast many times and each time it gets ever so slightly worse. This most recent visit was really the final straw for me.  The food is so overly salted that I have to wonder if there is an enormous salt lick in the back that they use when heating up the food.   My son likes to drink milk and the little cartons of milk available for the kids have been spoiled the last three visits. The dates have been fine but the contents of the cartons have been spoiled to the point of becoming cheese....ew.  With that in mind...something is wrong here.   The service is sketchy at best. What starts out as a great server ends up overwhelmed, annoyed, and irritable within 30 minutes. Who knows why or what happened but all I know is that the plates stop coming and the friendliness goes out the window.   So basically...skip this place. Go down the road to the JB's in Sun City Grand. Sure the blue hairs will glare at you because you are on their turf, but at least you'll get a decent meal."}
{"text":"I took my son and my mother to eat here for the first time. Everyone was so excited about this place opening up and we wanted to try it for ourselves. It was the worst spent money at a buffet ever! The food was horrible, the service sucked and it was a mess in there. Not ever eating there again. Not worth it in the slightest!"}
{"text":"Just an update.  My GF and I go to this location a lot for breakfast.  It is a pretty good deal -- less than $10 pp for AYCE with the drink included.  They have a wide variety of breakfast meats --- bacon, sausage links, sausage patties, ham, etc. etc.  Not top quality but decent and passable.  Full salad bar, even at breakfast, and pot roast beef, pork chops, pop corn shrimp, etc. etc.  Yesterday for the first time I can remember they had menudo too.  I am a big fan of anything tripe so I eat menudo a lot, especially at Food City.  This menudo was OK but weakly seasoned and not additional condiments to top it -- no diced onion, no oregano, no cilantro.  But it was OK -- I ate 3 eight ounce bowls of it.  I always say Golden Corral is decent place to eat a lot at a reasonable price!"}
{"text":"The first thing I noticed was the line. I ended up waiting half an hour to be seated on a Saturday afternoon. At least for one visit, it was worth it. Golden Corral emphasizes freshness and quality. A definate improvement over Hometown Buffet. To top it off, a very excellent assortment of desserts. I'll have to come back for the dinner buffet, as it features cooked to order steaks among other things."}
{"text":"So there is really nothing special about this place its a generic buffet nothing spectacular excpet maybe the chocolate fountain and even then the marshmellows were stale the only thing good with that is the strawberrys. The food needed more flavor and the waffles were AWFUL the topping was that suger syrup fruit so no thanks. I mean I couldnt expect too much I was just wondering what the line was about and its really not that great. The enviorment was hectic and riduculouse people shoving people for a steak it was just sad and annoying. Overall it was average excpet its true the waiters did ask us if we wanted refills like 30times and they were nice so thats a plus I guess."}
{"text":"We went to the GC on a Saturday afternoon about 4:30pm.  We were trying to avoid the long lines I've read about.  No luck...it was about a 45 minute wait until we got seated.  If you haven't been here before expect a long wait.  This way you are in the right frame of mind.  The cost for dinner for two w/ drinks was $30 (plus tip).  Service was average.  Our waitress came by a couple of time for drink refills.  It did take a while for our used plates to be picked up.  I think the bus/wait staff is strength thin.   The food was excellent for a buffet.  There was a big selection of entrees from steak, turkey, ham and all the fixings.  There was Asian and Mexican food, a large salad bar and all the dessert you could want.  For the kids, there was pizza, chicken nuggets and mac and cheese. (kids under 3 eat for free). The food stations were well supplied and there was never more than a one to two wait at any given time  My overall experience was better than expected.  I would come back again when the lines are shorter."}
{"text":"Highly disappointed. This place is nice inside, set up is clean however the food is not good! The best comparison is school cafeteria food. Lacking of protein (meat options)... Alot of the food was cold and had been sitting for a while. Will never go back."}
{"text":"The food here is stale. The lighting makes it very unappetizing. The \"waiters?\" are very rude. The tables are way to close to the horrible buffet. The floor is filthy. Everything here is squeezed in. There's no room. This is one of the worst places I've been."}
{"text":"The food at the G.C. on Northern is as good as any.  Food, being mass produced is no better or worse than other places.  What I go there for is the breakfast which is only served on weekends.  There are many customers so the food like bacon and sausage doesn't sit around stewing in it's own grease. It's not a gourmet treat but it's still pretty good."}
{"text":"I give Golden Corral 2-3 stars at best.  The best deal for the price is breakfast; and at breakfast, the drinks are included in the price of the meal.  Additionally, since a \"traditional\" breakfast is bacon, eggs, biscuits, etc.  those items are A-OK.  But even their sausage at breakfast is substandard at best.  At dinner, the price is higher and the food quality is mediocre at best.  Plus the drinks are not included and are $2.59 each.  Even their senior discount is only a $1 off -- not even 10%.  And I agree with some other Yelpers that the steak guy is an ass.  So in general, I go to Golden Corral if I want a cheap, big-ass breakfast. But lunch and dinner are not favorite options for me."}
{"text":"Well  my coffee got cold , non flavored ... They could make the French toast better.. I still like Village inn French toast"}
{"text":"Food Its OK, but it deserves a 4 stars cuz my children love this place  Price Cheap, for this price and quality, I'll choose this over home town and souplantation down the street"}
{"text":"You know what? I really had high hopes for this place because I saw their commercials all the time but the closest Golden Corral was like in Apple Valley which unless I'm on my way to Vegas I will not visit and even on the way to Vegas I wouldn't stop here. So here's the deal. Don't waste your time in line. There is nothing inside that is worth going in. The place is over-hyped and overrun by some of the ghetto-ist looking people in my life. I don't know if it was just my luck or what but in an area that is mostly Asian there was a fairly large population of cholos there. Its what I imagine a prison cafeteria would look like if decorated by Denny's.   The line for the steak is long and it was a tough piece of cow. The salad bar didn't seem fresh and the dessert area was kind of messy. The seem well staffed but people are pigs. That's what it felt like too, like cattle herded to the trough. Maybe that's the Corral part. What really grossed me out was when I got some fried shrimp and one fell out of its bin on to the steam table. I left it there because it should be tossed. No longer edible right? Nope. A worker with bare hands tossed it back into it bin. Freaking gross, glad it didn't hit the floor. Never again! Bathroom was dirty too.   Our waitress was really nice but she was extremely busy because of the crowd. I would rather go to Hometown buffet and I hate Hometown. If I want a salad bar, its the Sizzler in West Covina for me."}
{"text":"What do you want when they throw food out for the masses. Had a lot of everything and when we were leaving, we saw a rainbow in the distance along with angels singing. Wait a minute, that's my stomach making that noise. I'll go back and strap the feedbag on the next time I come to town."}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying, I was 100% prepared to absolutely hate this place.  Upon arrival there was a line of about 20 people outside of the door...I wanted to split right then.  The makeup of people in the line and inside were composed of individuals from the lower rungs of society (not judging...just saying that's how it was).  Anyway...in the final analysis, I can say with confidence that it is better than every Las Vegas hotel buffet costing less than $40...and yes, I frequent them all.  Seriously good selection of items, some of my favorites:  Deviled Eggs, green bean casserole, quality steaks (note: Grill chef will prepare two-stages past whatever you request unless you're on top of him!), sautéed mushrooms, various kinds of really good chicken and the whole chocolate waterfall thing.  All three times I've been there (Weekends 3, 4 and 5pm) it was CRAZY crowded, which surprised me on the 3pm Saturday visit.  BUT, this has the excellent effect of ensuring that all of the food is quite fresh.  Bottom line...I hope the rumors of a Henderson location appearing in the near future are true!  Because the Lamb Blvd. location is not a nice part of town, relatively speaking."}
{"text":"13.99 for dried out food that has been sitting for hours. No Thanks! Don't ask for fresh food either they won't put out new till the old is gone."}
{"text":"Fantastic place if you have a BIG appetite and want quality for your money. Everyone who works here are always trying to please the customer. If something doesn't meet your approval just tell them & they'll try to correct it right away. The manager Diane is sharp and will resolve any issues you might. I made the mistake of eating at the Glendale location - trust me they have a long way to go if they're going to match the Litchfield location."}
{"text":"Terrible service! Half of the servers cannot understand English. Half of the plates are dirty and unclean. Half of the food is missing on the buffet line. Sorry to say I will not be returning to this location nor recommending it to anyone."}
{"text":"Meh. Nothing to write home about. Also not a place I would hop up & suggest when there are a ton of other eateries in decent competition. 3 people cost $44... can't say the food was worth it. They have a good variety, for sure. But quality? Not so much. Half of it had been sitting on the buffet line so long that it was cold or almost \"stale\". For the price charged per person, I guess I expected some better quality.   I think I was more miffed at the fact there is no overall outline when walking in on WHAT the cost is. No way to tell what it costs per adult or child. No distinction on if initially ordering a drink (as they ask you while you are paying what you would like to drink) if drinks cost extra in comparison to just asking for a water. No receipt was provided after paying. Someone came by only ONCE to refill drinks & remove empty plates. The place was not dirty or unattended, but I just feel like it was not at all worth the cost per person when it came to the quality. Really, the variety is great, but mediocre food & almost misleading because there is no way to know what the cost is, overall.   For $44 to feed 3 people, I think I could have gone to the supermarket & made several QUALITY dishes worth a lot more than this was worth. Drinks included. Again- I would not hop at the opportunity to suggest this be the destination in comparison to other local eateries."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of buffets and never was for personal and health reasons.   I came here with a group to celebrate (not my idea) and the place was crowded for a 3pm lunch. As the people gave unfriendly looks at this small run down joint, I went about about my business to pick up some pop corn shrimp, fried fish, veggies and other fixings.  What can I say? Food taste better than hometown buffet that's a given, but I don't like buffets at all because generic, cheap, greasy and unhealthy food is something I am not a huge fan of.  If your idea of a good time or celebrating an occasion at a unfriendly, dirty, disgusting establishment, by all means (I won't come here again) :(.   Just keep in mind with the price also comes the type of demographic and environment. If you are expecting a nice, quiet, peaceful or enjoyable breakfast, lunch or dinner, you might want to throw down your chips somewhere else.   A dinner date here? If you really want to cut short your personal relationship, then this is the place to do it!"}
{"text":"Muy buen servicio! La gente muy amable, y después de las 4 pm, buena carne para el precio! Los felicito!"}
{"text":"No frills place for breakfast. Good place to go with a group. Good selection of food...scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, biscuits, steak carving station, ham, pancakes, waffles, omelet station, salad bar, desserts including a chocolate fountain.  They have everything that you would want. Nothing was disappointing about the experience."}
{"text":"Golden Corral is a franchise buffet, I seen them in Pennsylvania and Kentucky.  They aren't common like McDonalds, but there is definitely a consistent setup.  Now that I've been to some, considering the price paid, they rank from 1 star to 5 stars.  The better ones tend to be in the south imo, more \"southern hospitality\" from the waittresses perhaps.  When they're \"5 star\", it really is a bargain to get some steak and home-made chow.  And it's usually filled to the brim way past 8pm to reflect that.  This is a one star one.  At the other 2 golden corrals I've been in Kentucky, when they seat you, a server promptly brings a stack of clean plates, steaming fresh rolls with honeybutter packets, and ask everyone for their drink selection.  The rest of the night their job is to clear dirty plates away, bring new ones, and refill drinks.    If they're any good, they would earn as good tip from me as any waiter in a normal establishment for this service.  For a business trip I make to Monroeville anually, I've been at this one two years in a row now, thinking the first time was a fluke.  Nope.  The servers just don't give a f**k.  No plates, you get them yourself, which btw are pretty dirty like the washing machine doesn't work quite correctly.  I also never got rolls from their own iniative, the one time I asked, the server went \"oh, yeah\" and got several right from the buffet into a basket with the honeybutter packets.  The rolls looked like they were made days ago, were dented, lacked that glaze, looked like something a bakery would throw away.  My butter packets were even wrong, the server gave me packets smear with ketchup/thick_salsa and then never showed up the rest of the night.  My 2 used plates were never cleared away.  Half the dressings in the salad station were empty and half the ingredient were contaminated with ingredients from neighboring bins.  The rest of the food reflected this lack of care.  At a good golden corral, the workers really hussle and are busy.  Here, the server's attitude is reflected in the rest of the staff.  A big disappointment - I would rate it 0 stars if I could.  It was one of the few times I gave a 0 tip.  Twice in a row 1 year apart.  Even if the food sucked, I tend to tip if the service at least gave one iota of caring for their customer.  They just don't."}
{"text":"Disappointment!  I don't understand how you can cook the flavor right out of everything. Cheap price, cheap food and cheap ambience. I guess you get what you pay for. Definitely beneath hospital cafeteria food. I guess if you were born without tastebuds this is perfect for you."}
{"text":"We've been here several times for breakfast and always enjoyed ourselves. The food is fresh with an outstanding variety. Has some lunch food (chicken & beef) during the breakfast hours too. Keep up the good work Golden Corral!"}
{"text":"This is the worst place to eat! The food is just horrible! I went for dinner & was looking forward to the salmon they've been advertising however, I wouldn't feed it to my dog that's how bad it looked. My husband went for the prime rib & was served what looked like dried up beef roast. We spent $35.00 on crap! We will NEVER go there again!"}
{"text":"I really wanted this location to be better. We've traveled to AZ and UT on many occasions to dine at their locations, and the out of state locations have fared way better.  With this being the only location in Las Vegas, I anticipated a long line. We went on a Sunday late morning. The wait time was 15-20 minutes. It helped that the drink fountain is located in the area where you wait in line. The cashier was friendly as was the host that was seating us.  With it being a busy location and time frame in mind, I was disappointed. The restaurant is set up buffet style.  Certain areas were messy, and where people had spilled items all over the serving trays, workers were not fast enough in keeping the trays looking clean and tidy. (a quick glance and wipe down would take 10 seconds, but many of the workers stood behind their stations, not moving or double checking anything).  My son and I were about to dig into the mashed potatoes tray when the worker quickly swiped up the tray to scrape the tater remains into another full tray of taters, without so much as a quick smile or 'hold on one second so you can get fresh taters instead' acknowledgement. We just stood there with the serving spoon dripping tater remains, our mouths agape.  Had my husband been reviewing this restaurant instead, I would guess that he would give the place one star. More than once, he came back to our table with a disappointed look, once because the ranch dressing was out, and twice because the dish that looked most delicious to him kept running out, and the worker at the station responded in a less than friendly manner when he had asked what the wait time would be.   Another observation and in no way affects the rating I gave this place: restaurant patrons are RUDE. They cut in line to serve themselves something. Or, they let their kids run up to the dessert area to dip their desserts into the chocolate fountain, which results in splatters, spills, mess, and kids shoving each other. It was hectic!   PROS: desserts and chocolate fountain and cotton candy are my favorite. CONS: employees can SMILE and acknowledge their patrons."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Not a big fan of the fountains but everything overall was tops!  Funny I had to stand outside to get in line was crazy but, they went through ready fast. Roast was delicious, didn't seem like a lot of variety but, I got full so that great  I think for the first Golden Corral in Vegas it's great. Hopefully  stays tops!    plan on going back when it's a bit quieter!! And they closed Christmas in case you wanting to go!!"}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW! I'm not sure if its a good wow though. I've seen for many years now all the commercials on TV for Golden Corral that I had to try it for myself. And considering there's so few of them in Southern California this was a must try.  I pass by the City of Industry Golden Corral every time I travel into Los Angeles. And it's always busy.  The one other word that really comes to mind about my visit to Golden Corral is SODIUM!!! Boy, everything was really salty. To be honest, the food wasn't bad for a place like this. I had the buffalo chicken wings (pretty good), the bourbon chicken (not good), fried chicken (good, salty), roasted chicken (good, salty), steak slider (dry and too hard of a bun), Southern style fried fish (fish was tender but soggy cornmeal breading), fried okra (same problem as the fish), and the pork steak (very good but salty).  Overall, I'd say it was better than I would have expected. It sure reminded me of a Sizzler meets Home Town Buffet on Steroids!!"}
{"text":"The place was ok. Got enchiladas and they were dry got some fries same issue dry or they felt like they've been sitting there for a while. The Mac and cheese was ok. This place is similar to hometown buffet but Golden Corral is a tad bit better. Didn't get to try the fountain, but next time I go for sure ill try it:)"}
{"text":"Yummm !! I was wishing I hadn't eaten breakfast before visiting this place for an early lunch. My senses were just getting started as I went back for a third plate, & by the time It was gone two things were clear:  ONE, I had to use what little room I had left to sample a few the desserts that were calling my name from across the room and...  TWO, I have to make it back here soon with a BIG appetite!     =)"}
{"text":"It was good but I wouldn't go back. The food was okay. I went during the all you can eat wings, and it's not what they advertise because there's not much of a selection. There was too many people to really enjoy it. A lot of kids running around, people cutting in line at the buffet line, overall too cluttered. It's worth going once to try it."}
{"text":"Service was great .... food was tasty!! I was hoping for a larger setup but for what this Golden Corral has to offer , it was still worth it !!"}
{"text":"Not the Golden Corral it use to be. (This review is meant for a year ago) The restaurant smells dirty when you sit to eat your food. Food, ya that has changed as well. The Meatloaf was bland, the Mashed Potatoes & Macaroni & Cheese tasted gross. However, the service was great and our waitress was friendly. But I must say we will never go back. Unless they remodel and get new cooks."}
{"text":"Uh, I am not mad that my whole family can eat for under $50! I am not mad that there is finally a Golden Corral in Las Vegas. Although if I am being all the way honest, I am a bit mad they put it on the east side. Come on, the ghetto will travel for a $12 buffet I promise. But at the same token, the lonely ol' east side that I grew up on needed some good food. Hopefully when you dine, the crowd will be a bit more pleasant.  My bf and I decided to try it for lunch (please don't tell my kids). Our total was under $20, so instant score in my opinion. They also offer sweet tea. Double score. You wait in line to pay, and get drinks before reaching a cashier. Somewhat silly because if the waitresses aren't up on game, it is a bit hard to get a refill. Plus, it holds up the line a bit. For lunch the selections were not bad at all! Pasta, pizza, meatloaf, fish, fried chicken, a few Asian choices, and a small salad area. The desserts section was big, but the chocolate fountain didn't look all that sanitary so I skipped. It is a perfect height for kids (with no sneeze guard) to walk right up and stick their dirty little, bug eating, butt picking fingers right in it! And I watched plenty un-supervised kids do exactly that. Don't take this the wrong way, there is a sneeze guard, but not if you are under 4 feet tall! The ambiance really reminded you that you were eating on Charleston and Lamb and I was really hoping they would avoid that. But honestly it was the people eating, not watching their kids, getting every possible bang for the buck they could, that set the tone.  I will return, mostly to let the kids try it. We will see how that experience goes and then decide if I will continue to dine."}
{"text":"Been here twice and both times were a disappointment. It doesn't appear that there isn't any management.  The employees do as they please.  Both times I did not get one refill. You are lucky if they pick up your plates.  It looks like a mass confusion.  The chocolate fountain must be full of germs after all the unsupervised kids get their fingers in it. Last but not least.  I ordered a medium rare steak and got a well done steak.  I mentioned it to the cook and asked for one more rare. I got another well done steak. I was really anticipated a much better experience"}
{"text":"This place is a 5 star if you go for dinner.  3 star or less if you go for lunch.  The vegetables at dinner time are so fresh and delicious.  My husband and son love the all you can eat steak.  The rolls are hot and delicious as is the banana pudding dessert.  Mmmmm.."}
{"text":"here i las vegas nv,.the food  was very salty and wife had hight  pressure   i spoke with the general manager  did not  lister ,.   did not respect  not professional  he said that 4 year those  cooks did the job well,,."}
{"text":"I've been to better, but also paid so very much more. I've been to worse, but also paid so very much more.   For Thanksgiving, I went out with my aunt, uncle and cousins to the Golden Corral, to avoid having to cook and clean. All we had to do was endure an almost 90 minute wait in line though.   As far as the food quality, it's an inexpensive buffet that didn't make me sick while at the same time, isn't making me scream from the mountain tops to go and eat there. Service was surprisingly good as their jobs are to clear tables and refill drinks. No taking orders, bringing them out or dealing with the bill.   It was ok. It's all I that I have to say as that's all that comes to mind."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service!! The waitress hardly came to our table, she was standing behind her station, by The restrooms the whole time. The guy that was making cotton candy was rude to the children waiting. The restroom smelled like an outhouse! Will not be returning."}
{"text":"You know what? I actually dig this place. I came here not expecting much, and I was very pleasantly surprised by the whole deal. Quantity, quality, service, value... check x 4.   Don't get me wrong. Golden Corral is by no means a place you would expect to get 5 star cuisine... but for the price point, I think it's totally spot on. From what I'd heard from others, I was expecting worse than Hometown Buffet and luckily, we got that, and then some.  Really enjoyed the salad bar, very fresh and good selection... and the cheddar biscuits- totally reminded me of Red Lobster's version. Some of the items were hit or miss. Mini sliders were a total surprise hit for us. Stick to the basic American comfort foods like fried chicken, meatloaf, mac and cheese, etc. and you'll be just fine. The \"Chinese\" food was very meh.   So you doubt my 4 stars? 9 bucks for all you can eat, babe. The good totally outweighs the bad. You can't go wrong with that."}
{"text":"So the food is typical GC fare which isn't bad in my book, however the place is in a rough part of town, a few homeless people milling around in the parking lot.  I made  the mistake of going on a Sunday evening so Dregs of society were out in force.  Next time I'm in the area I'll just go to a different location."}
{"text":"Stopped-in here twice while working in the area and both times the staff was friendly, the food was fresh (despite my going an hour or so before they closed on a weeknight).  Great place to go if you just want to get your feed on!"}
{"text":"First off this is NOT a 5 Star restaurant, nor does it endeavor to be. My rating is in comparison to other casual buffets.   I've been to more buffets then I care to admit, including many Golden Corrals while traveling around the country.   Honestly, I'm not sure what all the negativity is about. The store is kept very clean, especially considering the volume of customers. We got there around 3 on a Wednesday and there were no lines, but it was already crowded inside. The food is good quality (better than many of their competitors) and there's a large variety to choose from. The Mexican and Chinese food are not their strong points, but still add to the selection. The salad and desert bars are very extensive, featuring cold shrimp, strips of steak and crumbled blue cheese and chocolate fondue, cotton candy and hand scooped ice cream, respectively.  I truly think that all the bad reviews are just written by people who dislike buffets, which is fine, but that being the case why would you go there in the first place and then complain about it? If you like buffets this is one of your best bets. With the quality and selection offered it's hard to believe lunch is just over 8 bucks, which is probably why the line is often out the door.   In all fairness, there are some downsides. The crowd is a pain and doesn't exactly make for a relaxing meal, but they keep the food well stocked and the lines moving as best as they can. I'm not crazy about the buffet set up where all the food is in a row as opposed to the various scatter bars. It's not as convenient and creates line ups. I really don't care for having the drink bar at the counter before you pay. It takes longer to check out and it's tiresome waiting for the overworked staff to bring you refills. I never order a drink as it costs more and they only serve Pepsi products--ick, but we were low on water several times.   In short, it you're looking for an affordable meal with a variety large enough to please your whole family, then this is the place for you. If you want a quiet meal, with stunning ambience and gourmet food it will most likely cost you over $10.  :)"}
{"text":"Finally a Golden Corral near home!~ I have eaten at the one up at Bakersfield, and that one was very good. So now to try this one!   Line is long of course, and prices are cheap for a decent buffet (better than Hometown Buffet!!!). Instead of my GOOD/BAD kind of review, I will pin point each station, as all of them have their positive and negative aspect. Itallian and Chinese were skipped cause they're my frequent eats at home.  LINE: I expected a long wait as it was up Central Cali. When it got to the inside of the place for the line, it was way too stuffed once you get to the cash register. There was barely any room to move an inch. They really need to fix this, especially some of us are carrying drinks in our hands.   SODA FOUNTAIN: Lots of variety, and a little messy.   SERVICE: Pretty attentive at some points, and sometimes not so much. I feel like they shove a waiter/waitress to one area, and just only one waiter/waitress per area, and this place is pretty big. It took awhile to get a refill of my drink cause our waitress was nowhere to be found. She had to take care of the whole side of the room :/ Plus, when we arrived, we notice she also was in charge of cleaning the floors. So they need more staffing and not skimp out or put a soda fountain available for customers to get themselves, cause a lot of people were needing refills and getting upset (no no, not just me).  BREAD: Good selections. I really enjoy the buttery cheese biscuits! they're almost like the ones from Red Lobster ^.^   SEAFOOD: I didn't get to taste a lot since they ran out most of the time :[ So I stuck with popcorn shrimp.  MEATS: Well, I wanted to try a bbq slider or steak slider, but it keeps running out @.@   MEXICAN: I should of skipped this! At the other GC, I made a fajita and that was enjoyable. In this station, I tasted the enchilada, and it was bland and weird. I guess cause I'm so used to my bf's mom's authentic Mexican cooking. But what really turned me off was their tortilla chips. They're so thin and tasted like paper. Why had they not use corn tortilla?!  OTHER: They have sweet baked potato and that was delicious, and OH! real bacon bites for it! YUM! Like actual bacon, not the red hard rock fake ones. I also like their bourbon chicken a lot.  DESSERT: My favorite of course. The chocolate fountain, cookies, ice cream, and cotton candy~ BUT for that line for ice cream, it's so disorganized :/ kids and people are cutting in front! And you don't even know if the person in front is going for the swirly ice cream machine or the scooped ice cream.  So my expectations were a little high on service and organization, cause the one up Central, is superb than this. Since the place is crowded with lots of fellow diners, it may be a battle to get your favorite dish at each station. Hell, I didn't get to have some fancy fish or them sliders ;_____; and was really dying for a refill on my drink several times. And I wish some employees smiled :/  Good cheap prices, nice selection of food, long line. That is all :]"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite restaurant/buffet. I want for breakfast buffet. The price includes drinks and steak. Love the steak, it was very tender and delicious."}
{"text":"This review is for the weekend breakfast buffet.  It was pretty bad. All the food was cooked wrong or seasoned wrong it seems. I will just list them out! lol   - regular bacon. Like no flavor at all. Just bland. I don't know how this happens. Just crispy pork strips. Didn't really taste bacon.  - deep fried bacon. The batter was so damn salty! It had the crappy bacon in the middle and this terrible batter.  - county fried steak. Not cooked right. The batter was like falling off. The steak was alright, I don't think it was round steak. Way to salty.  - the ham cubes. Just tasted bad. what glaze was that!  - Hash browns. Not crispy at all, no flavor. Maybe get some salt from that batter for the bacon.  - biscuits and gravy. Gravy, no flavor and runny. Biscuits average.  - breakfast sausage. No damn flavor man.  They had the normal fried chicken, and the normal desert bar. Random mexican food.   French toast was good. Apple and orange juice (though apple juice seemed super sweet).  Overall, very sad. I like their lunch (sliders and liver n onions baby!). The breakfast food is very bad to me. They need to step it up.  I will never come back here for breakfast!  I will make a trip for lunch again though )"}
{"text":"I have seen the adds for this place on TV non-stop so when they opened I couldn't wait to try it. Well it was a big let down.. The price was a little high for what they offer. I mean this is Vegas the home of the Buffet. They should have really up their game to compete here.  The place was busy but the wait wasn't that long. The food was just ok. It was nothing  we couldn't had got in any buffet on the strip for half the price. For a new building the place looked like a dump. I think they were trying to show case the freshness of the food but the piles of boxes and other things just made behind the buffet looked cluttered and unkempt.  The poor server was doing his best but he couldn't keep up the mess that people were making and leaving behind.  The dessert section was lacking it was like a buffet  set out at the nursing home with lots of little cookies, jello, and puddings. There was nothing there was would make you go wow.  As for the Wonderfalls they were really thin and didn't coat the things people were dipping. I by passed them even before I read the reviews on here."}
{"text":"Since I have never been a big fan of buffet places outside of Las Vegas, my expectations for this place were not very high. After driving into the parking lot and saw that the line was literally out the door and nearly half the length of the building outside, I was hoping that there would be a reason why all these people were standing in line to eat here. Maybe this place would be better than the cafeteria-type food I was expecting...  We had a party of 8 and only 7 had arrived, but the cashier was nice enough to let me pay for our 8th person so they wouldn't have to wait in line to join us inside. This place has very few tables for parties larger than 4, so we were seated at 2 adjoining 4-person tables. It was a Friday night and the place was CROWDED. Each of the various stations had quite a line, but I made it a point to try a sample of each place.  The salad bar and dessert bar were both pretty standard, with the dessert bar featuring novelties such as real ice cream (as opposed to a soft-serve machine) and cotton candy, as well as a chocolate fountain. The fresh breads section was fairly good. I enjoyed the garlic cheese biscuits and my friend said that the yeast rolls were great too.   Most of the other food was rather normal or sub-par. Not very different from your run-of-the-mill Hometown Buffet in terms of quality, and with similar selections. The steak line was pretty long, but the cook would only serve \"rare\" or \"well done\" even when asked for medium rare or something else. The well done was overcooked and the rare was very rare. A lot of the fried food, such as the steak fries, fried shrimp, and fried chicken were good, but a lot of the other times, such as the mac and cheese, corn on the cob, and veggies lacked flavor and just screamed \"frozen food from Costco!\" Not cool. I'd skip most of the \"ethnic dishes\" as well unless you don't mind the lack of authenticity or good taste in general.   Since the place was constantly busy, it was understandable that the restaurant was a MESS. Our table must've had lil kids eating on it before us, because the seats and underneath the table were covered in crumbs and leftover food. Not a big deal for me, but moreso for our resident clean-freak.   So overall... The good: The service was great and friendly. Props to the cashier for seating us without our entire party being present. Service was great. Our server was friendly, quick, and courteous. One extra star thanks to Brittany for her great service. At $12 for dinner, you can have a ton of food on a relatively low budget.  The bad: Most of the food was very average, and some of the food was just not good at all.  The ugly: The place is very busy and always seems to be packed, so be prepared to wait if you coming during a busy lunch or dinner period. Messy and crowded. Has the ambience of a cafeteria."}
{"text":"My wife waited about 10 minutes to have an omette made, the man was very rude and told her that she was in wrong line and to go to other side. My wife said that was where she got it last time, man siad that was along time ago. My wife asked if he was this rude to everyone, no answer except \"Have a good day Mommie\". Food was okey but not going back to have staff be rude to us. There are ways to talk to people and rudness is not one of them."}
{"text":"I love it here either for breakfast, lunch or diner. The staff are very friendly. My family and I always enjoy visiting this location."}
{"text":"Ricky, Ricky, RICKY is a hero!!!! I put my twin in our double stroller. Was getting my other twin out of our car seat. Saw a Golden Corral employee running like he was insane!!! Ricky was running like he was in trouble. I wondered what the heck has he done. Look up from getting baby # 2 and Ricky had ran down a run away stroller. I didn't lock stroller. Later learned he ran from behind the counter when he saw the stroller in motion. Ricky may have saved my baby's life. I thank God for him"}
{"text":"AWFUL. The salad bar was the only thing I could eat. Food is the lowest quality I've ever seen at a buffet. Stay far away from this dump."}
{"text":"Being Easter Sunday and meeting up with my family for early dinner it was my mom's call as to where we were going.  Unfortunately she always wants to go to some buffet for as she puts it \"where there is always something for everyone.\"  This statement is simply not true.  But again her call and I went along with it.  I really have a dislike for almost every buffet place I have ever eaten, especially one that is so cheap, you know the quality goes down with the price.  Over the years I have come to know what BUFFET actually stands for, The B is for bunch, and the E & T are eating together... Message me if you want to know what the UFF stands for:)  So after Easter service we left Mass for the masses of people flocking to the Corral.  I really see no need to rip this place apart, I mean it is what it is.  You can't go here and expect grade A food, it just doesn't work like that for 11.99 a person all you can eat.  The employees for the most part seemed to be hard at work stocking plates, cups, bowls, and whatnot.  There were some waits on things which is ok.  I was disappointed with their steak.  Again I am aware this isn't Morton's or anything but the med rare steaks were more medium well, tough, and ¾ of fat encased whatever meat in there that was edible.  I ended up getting three of them because off one you could only get one or two bits then you have to pitch the rest of the fatty beast.  I really liked the mushrooms though, and sadly they were the best part of the meal... Ah maybe that isn't that sad... Again it is what it is.  Clearly this place is great to go if you have a big family on a budget, love to overeat, or just don't care what things taste like.  I really wish Mom would have opted to cook this year!  Oh well, they are a successful chain so there must be a lot of individuals that fit into the above criteria."}
{"text":"Don't understand the 3 stars or under ratings because this buffet is awesome!  The food is hot and tasty.  There's such a wide variety of classic comfort food that my family and I went back over and over again!    Their buffet is better than the last three casino buffets I've been to ( Orleans, Rio and Red Rock).  The prices are very reasonable for what they offer.  Give it a try.  We can't wait to go back!  Wish they had one closer to me here in the Southwest part of town.  Are you listening, Golden Corral?!"}
{"text":"I'm not sorry to say that I will not be returning back to this restaurant franchise.  The horrors that I walked into on my last visit 6.13.15 must go untold. I will spare you all of the gory details but I would have to say that this restaurants adherence to state health code compliance is questionable at best.The rolls were cold, the carpets smell of wet dogs and cat urine. The Golden Corral is in a sad state."}
{"text":"I had such high hopes for this place. The wait was about 1 hr for me. I was fine with this and took it as a sign that I would be amazed by the food. Once inside I realized that this place is amazingly overpriced. $12 for dinner + $3 for a drink.... At such a low quality buffet??? The food options weren't nearly as extensive as it seems in photos. The meats were all tough and the lines for food were wayyyy to long. Servers were inattentive and I had to hunt one down every time I needed a drink refill. This place isn't worth the money or the time. Go to Hometown or Soupplantation instead"}
{"text":"My family and I came to las Vegas for vacation. I seen the golden corral in a commercial... I must say this place is awesome its really good , people are pleasant with good customer service...I been to other buffets and its not the same...what ever your doing good job...we were in a 5 day vacation we ended up coming here for more than 1time."}
{"text":"I'd like to commend the 3 Gentlemen on the grill (Torran, Steve and Michael) for their hospitality and EXCELLENT JOB ON THE STEAKS!!!!  The food here was awesome!!!  Please make sure you tell these Men that their hard work is appreciated!  They deserve to take pride in their work!  Server was Ambar and she didn't miss a beat!!  Kept our drinks full and constantly checked in on us!  I had no cash but I SWEAR I'm coming back with a tip this week, Ambar!!  Great job, Guys!!"}
{"text":"This place is nasty...not worth 12 a person! Food is very gross not fresh...and the place over all is very dirty...service wasnt good...our table was filled with dishes and no one was coming around to pick it up...over all im never coming here again!."}
{"text":"My number one pet peeve is cobwebs hanging over my head while I'm trying to eat and a rude hostess..this place is awful. And smells like a dirty toilet bowl. Too bad because the food is decent. Maybe you guys should change the carpet."}
{"text":"This buffet is ridiculously cheap. I came here once during grand opening week for the Dinner Buffet and it was chaos. Lines were everywhere it seemed and it took forever to get food. I haven't been back for many months.  Until yesterday.  I decided to come back for the Lunch Buffet. For $8.49 per person plus $1.99 for drinks, I thought it was a really good deal. Plus, we didn't have to wait in line at all, just zoomed right in. This was around like 2pm-ish.  Some of the dishes that I thought were alright include Macaroni and Cheese, Mashed Potatoes, Lasagna, and Popcorn Shrimp.   I thought the ice cream was the best part. There's multiple flavors like Cookies and Cream, Mint Chocolate Chip, Butter Pecan, and Rainbow Sherbet to name a few. They serve you by the scoop. There's also a self soft serve machine.   I've had cotton candy on the first visit and I learned quickly that it's not something I should end my meal with. It's super sweet and I didn't want to move afterwards.  The service was okay but could have been better. It took us a while to get our drinks refilled. Had I known I would've overfilled it to the brim before we paid. It also took them a while to take our plates away. Luckily, we didn't fill up the table or that would have been a nightmare.  The booths aren't all that great. There's cushion on the bottom but nothing but hard wood on the back so.. just don't lean back. I guess that's their way of saying \"We don't want you here that long...\"  I don't know if I would come back. I mean nothing really stands out except the fact that it's super cheap.  So yeah overall experience at the Golden Corral wasn't very golden at all. I'd call it the Silver Roundup or maybe even the Bronze Rodeo."}
{"text":"This is a very busy location, but the staff if very pleasant and always willing to help.  Food is hot and fresh with a great variety."}
{"text":"2pm week day...nothing stocked...no food...waste of money...others have said it's been like this for last couple months."}

I had a party of 30 this past saturday for my daughters 1st communion we decided to take the family there after .the service was great we got sited in like less the 10 min . We where in different areas but we where fine with that I would highly recommend this place the food was great and the variety was awesome :) I would defiantly come back ..."}
{"text":"i dont like anything about this place.  the line... 30 min till closing and there is still a line out the door? i cannot comprehend.  the quality of food for the vegas style wait, it was not worth it.  it is crowded and loud at least 4 people/kids ran into me  if you eat a lot and want a variety of ok food, this is the place for you"}
{"text":"I used to love my local Miami Golden Corral. Since moving to NC, I have noticed that each location I visit is completely different than another one. Kind of surprising that there is so little consistency.   I visited this location with a coworker who had been there before. She was attracted by the 7.99 lunch price and the salad bar. She had water with her meal, and didn't leave a tip, so her total was less than 8.50 with tax. Seems a little pricey for a salad bar, but she enjoyed it. Because I ordered a soda, and left a 2.00 tip, my lunch was nearly 13.00!   I skipped the salad, and went for the hot food. Maybe it's me, but I had to walk up and down a couple of times before I could find anything appetizing to try. The veggies were overcooked, the fried foods were greasy, and the pot roast was dry. The fried chicken was good, OK; it was really good. Other than that, there wasn't anything else to point to as being worth the price (or effort)."}
{"text":"Decided to give it another try and boy did we make a mistake. I added several pictures that will speak louder than any review I could write. Stay very far away from this place."}
{"text":"Not so golden. Be very selective what you eat.  Steak was good fresh of the grill and vegies"}
{"text":"Food was ok. Servers ok but cashier was horrible! Ok, some people are just not meant to work in the food industry. At least smile!   Place had a very gross smell! At first we thought maybe because we were sitting kinda close to the restrooms but the farther we moved from there the worst the smell got!   Maybe if I'm desperate enough I will go back!"}
{"text":"There probably isn't a better place within miles that has a better bang for buck value than this place. The food isn't mind blowing or anything but it's ok. Maybe around the quality of an average diner/grill/bar. Better than denny's that's for sure -_-.  And for like 10-12 bucks ayce, what more can you ask for? It definitely beats eating at any chinese buffet, hometown buffet, or even todai (bang for buck-wise.) Main con is the long line and the fact that it's a bit difficult to get the Tilapia from the grill.   The best things to get there in my opinion are...  Fried Chicken  Fried Fish  Grilled Tilapia   Grilled Shrimp w/ pasta/rice pilaf  Chocolate covered strawberries   Ice Cream   And what not to get are...  Most of the chinese food section besides for this sweetish chicken which was pretty good. (not the orange chicken.)   Not a fan of the pork ribs.    Meat at the salad bar.   And some other food that were decent/pretty good were...  Hush Puppies  Pizzas  Steak  most of the salad bar excluding the cold meat.   I heard there were fried gizzards but I didn't see that when I went so I have to look out for those next time."}
{"text":"Arrived a bit before 8PM On Friday night (1-1/2 hours before close). Not a lot of a staff manning the buffet. Empty, picked over & veggies well past their prime (brown broccoli?). Kids were licking their fingers and then grabbing serving utensils without parent or staff intervention. Tub of sour cream with something in it that looked like cinnamon? That was a definite pass. Desert station looked like someone cleaned it out. You had to find staff to ask for baked goods. No cotton candy??? They claimed they were out. All it is is sugar, how can you be out? The topper was the kids sticking their hands in the chocolate fountain. Ugh."}
{"text":"First time here and we were pleasantly surprised. After reading some of the other reviews, I was a bit hesitant about coming here. It was actually quite good. The staff was friendly and they were always busy. The wait staff kept up with cleaning the tables & filling drinks. The buffet was well stocked & the food looked fresh. Everything we tried was well prepared and the proper temperature. I even tried the steak and I was surprised that it was very good. We'd go back for sure. Too bad there isn't a location in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Not very good. This place always smells gross and seems dirty. The food is average at best. Plus the price is a little high"}
{"text":"I want Yelp to establish some serious ground rules in regards to buffets.  If you're a woman and weigh less than 150 pounds and you're a man and you weigh less than 185 pounds, you are not allowed to write buffet reviews. Seriously. Maybe Yelp should include a \"Do you weigh less than 150/185 pounds\" as an additional business tip when it comes time to review buffets. Hating on a buffet because you because you don't like the general \"quality\" of the food is like a fat guy (like me) hating on a tapas restaurant because I don't like the \"quantity\" of the food.   Maybe Yelp should include a \"Do you weigh more than 150/185 pounds\" as an additional tip if you eat at a tapas-style restaurant?   Enough ranting. All I can say is that Golden Corral is a slightly more expensive, but higher quality (in terms of food) buffet than Hometown Buffet. I like Hometown's seating arrangement better with it's ample amount of booths whereas Golden Corral seems satisfied to be primarily tables to get the customer in and out. As with all buffets, only order water as a drink so you can chow down more and don't forget to bring cash to tip the bussers/drink servers because there's no option to tip at the register."}
{"text":"Since everyone is typing essays here, I'll give a quick one. Food is pretty good, not great. Dessert is good but it depends on what you get and how full you are after killing yourself with steak(which is pretty good especially made to your preference). Everything else that is not fresh made (i.e. chinese food, the non-fresh fish, hush puppies) tastes like ones from the mediocre buffets. Worth the wait? not really. Come back again? maybe after few months. To me, it is just for try, not for once a few weeks. Price is CHEAP though!"}
{"text":"Used to be a lot less fried food now everything is fried. I know it's not a gluten free place but you can't find anything without breading or questionable sauce or gravy. The cooked veggies they have are bland & dry looking.  The baked fish & baked chicken make it tolerable.  Salad is ok. But my husband always wants to eat here. Ugggg"}
{"text":"I'm not in the business of enjoying many buffets these days. My girlfriend doesn't appreciate my ever expanding waste line and my new found squishy qualities as much as I do. So where's the first place I go on a weekend away with the dudes? Buffet.  Nope, the food isn't spectacular, the service isn't worth raving about, and the atmosphere is pretty reminiscent of a fancy high school cafeteria. But, it's a buffet. You pay a small, small price for an endless supply of food. Best part? I had steak, New Orleans chicken, gobs of rice, heaps of ice cream, and some other stuff I can't remember because of the food coma, AND all of it was either respectably OK or even fairly enjoyable.   Golden Corral will forever have a spot in my heart and a gaping hole in my stomach to fill."}
{"text":"Best Buffet in the Inland Empire hands down.  Gets a little crazy at times but pretty clean and a great selection of different food.  Probably the closest thing you are gonna get to a Vegas buffet without going to a casino."}
{"text":"Ew! Just nasty ! Restroom has 1-2 inches.. yes inches of standing water. The super sweet server said it's from a leaking toilet that has been leaking for 5.. yes 5 days! Food was not hot."}
{"text":"First time here. Not to bad ran out of cheese cake. I really liked ham & potatoes, cotton candy my grandson's favorite. I want to visit on Friday or Saturday menu is different."}
{"text":"Nasty horrible food. Nasty horrible management. Way overpriced. Horrible experience, and I will never spend my money in this establishment again. They really are feeding people pink undercooked pork and refusing to refund. As I was trying to take pictures of the undercooked pork, one of the employees aggressively stepped in front of me and told me I'm not allowed to take pictures of the food. So I uploaded a picture of the manager."}
{"text":"We went in for the last day of the \"Prime Rib, Catfish,& Shrimp Feast.\" What a wonderful & amazing surprise! What an awesome experience!   The staff was cordial, and we headed right for the PR carving station. We had spoken w/ managers Edward & Linda about our concerns that the PR would be over-cooked.They assured us that that they'd have rare / medium rare - and they delivered!   It was PERFECT w / excellent jus, too! I grew up in Scottsdale, so I've eaten the famous PR at Dale Anderson's, The Other Place, Pink Pony, Don & Charlie's, etc. No one has done it better than Golden Corral did!    Also, the steaks were cooked to order (ie., rare), and the other mains that I tried were first-class! Sides were really varied, the salads absolutely fresh, and the desserts way too-tempting! I do have to admit that I had some chocolate fountain items and cotton candy (don't report me to my paleo colleagues!)...   BTW, the cooks & prep people behind the line were incredibly dedicated to their tasks, as were the folks working in the dining room, too! How lucky to have such a dedicated crew!  This was my first visit to any GC, and it was something I will recount to other foodies for... well, years! Thanks for such a wonderful, memorable Prime Rib Feast!"}
{"text":"The food selection was great and fresh. Restaurant was clean. We will be returning to this location. Only con was the cashier wasn't the most friendly, but other then that staff was great."}
{"text":"Build it, and they will come. Yes, they built it and they came alright. Ironically, a Home Depot is right next to it. I gotta give GC some credit for their concept is pretty straightforward. With hundreds of buffets all around Vegas, another one isnt gonna hurt right? After having dinner here tonight because of my father in law's birthday choice, I would say the A-OK rating of 3 stars was pretty much spot on.  So before I relay my experience, let me get the necessities out of the way. ADULTS Breakfast: $8.59 Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays only from open to 11 am. Lunch: $8.59 Mon thru Fri 10:30 am to 4 pm. Dinner: $11.89 Mon thru Sat 4 pm to close. Sun 11 am to close.  CHILDREN Ages 3 and under free. Limit 2 free meals per adult purchase. Ages 4 to 8 $4.79  Ages 9 to 12 $5.79  SENIORS 60 AND OVER Same as adults but $7.99 for breakfast and lunch.  Dinner is $10.99  None of these prices include drinks which is another $1.99 for a plastic tumbler. $2.50 for a large to go cup. Water there is no charge. So remember, the original price is just for the food. So dinner turned out to be a little over 15 bucks per adult because waterjust aint gonna cut it.  Every day there is a different theme so for monday it was seafood night. Sorry peeps, crab legs aint one of them. You did have popcorn shrimp, breaded shrimp, breaded white fish, breaded clam strips and stuffed crab. None of which blew me away but at the same time was not bad meaning it was edible.  Of course the the main feature was the grill area where sirloin steaks were being grilled. Kudos to the designer of the layout for all GC's because of the fact that you can see and smell what was being cooked on the grill. Surrounding that grill area are sides that you would typically see accompanying main entrees like sauteed mushrooms, onions, green peppers, etc.  Just to the right of the grill are where most of the items people start forming lines for like mashed potatoes, fried okra, all the above seafood items, and lots of others that you just have to see for yourself. One section that is guaranteed not to have a line is the salad bar section.   If you refer to my one plate of food, I pretty much got a little bit of everything I wanted put together. Some key notes to mention. The only things that really stood out for me were the yeast rolls, the fruits in the salad bar section, and the dessert section.   The yeast rolls are some of the best I have had in while. They are good by themselves but when you put a little bit of butter on them, man watch out, I can easily eat 3 of those without even blinking.  As for the award for the least amount of attention goes to the salad bar section. Yeah, I know, nobody really goes to a buffet to eat salad. You would be surprised though. I thought some of the fruit and vegetables they had there were pretty fresh and crisp. The actual veggies that you can put together to make your own salad can almost rival Sweet Tomatoes or Soup Plantation for you Californians.  The dessert section is commendable for it has a wide selection of different forms of sugar for you sweet tooth individuals from ice cream, soft serve, cotton candy, rice crispies, marshmellows, etc.  Notice I didnt mention the chocolate waterfalls. They had what looked like caramel, white chocolate, and milk chocolate. I know it all sounds like a good thing based on description and actually seeing it in person is awesome too but here's where the skidding sound comes in when you see a car slam its brakes. As I was looking to see what items to select and maybe dip in chocolate, this little kid comes out of nowhere picking his nose, sticks his finger into the chocolate waterfall, and proceeds to put it in his mouth. It happened so quick that I dont think anybody else saw it but me. Only problem is that when I replay it in my head its in slow motion so I get the full effect of what he did.  So take heed in my dessert experience, I wouldnt wanna go dipping anything in the chocolate for you dont know what unknown thing is floating around in there. Also the bathroom only has two stalls and has 3 urinals. You would think that a buffet would have the same amount of stalls or at least more because of the fact that its a buffet. Bottom line is that you get decent food selections at a decent price. I would rank this place a notch above Home Town Buffet.

{"text":"The wife and I ate here about a year ago and thought it was decent for the price.this is not a place or venue we may normally choose for dining but once in a while mediocre comfort food hits  the spot.Last nights dining experience was less than stellar,most the dishes they offered were not good at all flavor wise I ended up having a baker and a steak which the FOUR guys working the steak station were more intrested in standing in a huddle talking and joking and when i finnally got one of there attention he seamed a little put out that I wanted  a steak.............salad bar was decent ,service was good may be a long time before and if we go back"}
{"text":"My darling hubby (aka The Buffet King) has been wanting to come here since it opened. Cousin Amy loves Golden Corral and raved about it.  So we had to try it at least once. Finally we pass by and didn't see a line out the door.  Came on a Wednesday, around 1:30 and while crowded, the stations weren't swamped with people. We were able to get in right away, so we decided to give it a shot.  No surprise, the hubby had a grand ol' time. Lots of things for him to try.  For us diabetics, it's a trial. It was torture to bypass all the good stuff and stick with things that wouldn't make my glucose reading skyrocket later.  Very kiddie-friendly! Lots of what I heard a little girl happily refer to as \"brown\" (fried) food and even cotton candy.  Our server, Chris, was great. He should be working at a more formal restaurant!  Mixed reactions here. The hubby would love to come back, but he'll have to find someone else to accompany him.  Once was enough for me."}
{"text":"OMG, I can't believe I was dragged here. While, yes, they had a large selection of food, most of it was mediocre at best. For the rest of the day, I felt like a rock had settled to the bottom of my stomach and was not hungry thereafter even though I only had a small plate of food. Imagine the calories you're packing! I do have to say that their dessert table is quite extensive and was very tempting. I would say that is the best thing about the place. It just makes me uncomfortable that the fast majority of people in the restaurant really should not be eating at a buffet and certainly not a buffet packed full of calories like this one. Plenty of parking outside. A little hard to find as it is buried within a shopping complex."}
{"text":"Love it here! Breakfast is the best. Great Customer service. Never walk out hungry. Prices are fair."}
{"text":"I tell you what is bad about this place.  They don't offer any discount to active service members.  How do you hold your head high with commercials using the American flag!!!  Yet you don't support active Millitary.  These men and women have paid ten times over for a meal or even a discount.  NOTHING!!!!!  What a shame..  I won't be eating here.  My entire family has served!!!  There are many restraints that are like this.  People start to take notice!!!"}
{"text":"Wow... For all the hype it's not that spectacular. There are no trays which isn't ideal in a buffet. It's so crowded it's ridiculous. Granted it's new and it's the only one in town so some understanding is necessary. The food looked good and the variety is decent however I found the food to be mediocre, I was disappointed to see the manager arguing with a crew mate and some of the dishes were definitely dirty. I saw in one of the back doors and there was water covering the floor while the crew played and laughed and it was tracked everywhere.  It didn't look very clean which is the primary reason for the low rating I've given it. It was disappointing and it needs improvement."}
{"text":"I like it and so does my kids! The service is not all that great when it comes to refilling the drinks but it's a buffet so I don't trip. The food is always good and when I'm there they always have someone cleaning or refilling the buffet so there's always hot fresh food! There is a good selection of food and I LOVE THE SALAD BAR!!! The bread is to die for and the price is very reasonable! Children under 12 drinks are free and cheaper priced buffet and my 3 year old eats free so it's perfect for my family are 3 to go eat and I don't spend a arm and leg especially when I don't want to cook! I will be back often!!"}
{"text":"Not bad. Good food and a decent price. I love the Chocolate Wonderfall. Employees are nice and attentive. The selection is a little small, not as big as other Golden Corrals I have been to. The bananna pudding is really good. Overall, a okay place. I would recommend this place to people and i will probably return with my family."}
{"text":"Variety is indeed the spice of life at this wonderful family-friendly restaurant! You'll get quick and thoughtful service and because most of the workers look like they've done hard time, you will not get any stuck-up attitudes.  The food is plentiful and fun to speculate on. On my last visit, my dining partner pointed to his plate and said, \"I have no idea what any of this is!\" Still, we ate every bite and enjoyed it, too.  Lots of salads and meats and delightful desserts - carrot cake!  A fun time will be had by all!"}
{"text":"This is the best Golden Corral in the Phoenix area, the  service and quality of food is very good and exceptional at this price point. Huge selection of food and desserts most of which are great. The fried chicken and pot roast are stand outs for me. If you are in the west valley check it out."}
{"text":"I'm only giving one star because zero isn't an option.   As with many buffets, it was very very busy and the staff seemed to be unable to keep the in-demand items stocked for the demand.  Several times my wife and I attempted to head up to the buffet to get the items we missed on our last trip only to have rude people cut us off (not the fault of the restaurant, but still kills the atmosphere).    Waitress that we had was attentive and ensured our drinks were always filled, which was the ONLY plus for the visit.   After leaving the buffet, my wife and I were hit with food poisoning.  As this was the only meal we had eaten together in several days (I had been out of town on business), this was the only common factor.  We both spent the next two days not eating anything solid (I spend 3 days as I ate more) and taking typical steps to stay hydrated enough to function (we had a 6-month old child at the time that required us to care for him through this illness).    We contacted customer service both via email and by phone.  We received absolutely no response via email and by phone we were told someone would call us back - this didn't happen.    The absolute only thing we were thankful for during our visit was that our son was too young to eat anything from the buffet so that all three of us were not suffering from food poisoning.    When mentioned to my friends, some were surprised to hear this but admitted that they had not visited that specific location.  Others, that had visited that location, relayed similar stories and experiences of not getting any response from Customer Service.    We will absolutely, without any hesitation, not be visiting this chain ever again."}
{"text":"Well we couldn't resist lets try there breakfast.Me and my daughter went for 16 bucks what a deal compared to denny 37 bucks.Chicken fried steak with sausage gravy, omelate station, unlimited coffee,fruit galore, holy mackerel loosen up your belt and bring it on ! Oh yeah forgot to mention you they probably have the best fried chicken in town!!!!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Golden Corral since 2008 after my wife got food poisoning.  The bathroom even smelled funky throughout the restaurant.  I reported it to managment and they didn't seem to care so since then they don't get my business.  However, a friend treated us to this location and the experience was much better.  The food options were plentiful, fresh and delicious.  Go at lunch time the pricing is cheaper."}
{"text":"The food was average and there was a funky smell throughout the restaurant like someone had diarrhea the smell was coming from the bathroom. We let the manager know but he didn't appear to care.  This was a typical buffet larger than most but I do not like to wait for my refills so depending how busy it is will determine how long you wait for your refill.  We tried Golden Corral in Boise, ID and Goodyear, AZ both better experience.  Quite frankly, we prefer Old Country Buffet and will continue to patronize them instead of Golden Corral.  Dinner is cheaper and you get your own drinks :-)"}
{"text":"Crowded....and you pay first before sitting down... The worst? Make sure ALL your family members get here, otherwise, you won't be seated since they have to carefully count and organize the tables and chairs to squeeze in everyone.   Our family got shit for it because it was the first we've been here, and so they should at least put up a sign outside for people warning them that!  Food wise -  The steaks were chewy and dry...even the medium rare ones.... Prefer Souplantation or Sizzler better.... Prices are cheap, just like the food... First and only time coming here....  Though one Pro: They're molten lava chocolate cake was pretty good...."}
{"text":"Came here for the VIP soft opening with a friend for breakfast.  Service is fast, friendly, and courteous!  When you first enter the buffet, there is a fountain drink station. 50 cents extra if you want a to-go cup. There are the standard sodas, fruit juices and teas, but also Jamaica & Horchata.   We quickly went in to seat ourselves and the servers leave a cute name-card on your table so you could know who they are. Nice touch!  There was a fresh fruit and salad bar, yogurt, cereal bowls and milk, a station where they prepare custom omelette, make your own waffles, and other standard breakfast foods: eggs, potatoes, hash browns, etc.  I got 2 plates of food: Hash browns, scrambled eggs, bacon, quiche (very light & creamy), ranch potatoes, breakfast pizza (no tomato sauce, just scrambled eggs, bacon, & sausage; pretty good!), deviled eggs, french toast, and apple turn over.  For pancakes (they have chocolate chip & blueberry too), waffles, french toast, w/e you can add strawberries, peaches, more berries, powdered sugar, cinnamon, syrup, etc.   After this we had dessert! For the chocolate fountain there were skewers to pick your own chocolate dip foods. There were: macaroons, strawberries, truffles, rice krispies,  a heart cookie, marshmallows,etc. I also swiped a red velvet cake cupcake!! Before I left, I also took cotton-candy stick to-go; I felt like a kid again!  There is also a to-go option. They give you a box & you can fill it as much as you want, & it's $4.59 a pound.  Will definitely come back for lunch & try out the rest of the menu. Great for price & quality."}
{"text":"I waited patiently for the restaurant to open. I was disappointed. Price is around $15 per person w drink, the food is ok, just ok. Very unorganized. I waited in line approximately 50 minutes, and I was rushed aside by waiters coming to get refills for people. That's right you get your drink while you're waiting in line, which is very uncomfortable when you have small children. I think even if you didn't have children with you it would be uncomfortable. they attract a loud, disrespectful, and inconsiderate kind of clientele, as my family and I couldn't even hear each other of how loud and obnoxious people around were. Managment seemed to be ok with that type of behavior. We had to fight our way to our table of how packed and unorganized things were. So if you're looking for a quiet, and high class place to done in, THIS IS NOT FOR YOU. I did enjoy the cotton candy and chocolate strawberries, and their staff is very friendly. This alone is why I give it a 2, if not I would've given a total zero!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped here on Mothers Day as being my wifes 1st real Mothers Day and our place of choice was unavailable.  1st Impression was LOUD. The noise level was out of this world.  2nd Impression was WOW super busy and crowded.  All stations were at least 10 people deep.  The service itself was good and drinks were refilled quickly without needing to be asked.  The food left much to be desired.  Most of the stations were dried up and had hard crusty food on it from the last refill.  Some of the employees did not have gloves on handling the food.  2 of our party had to get to the restroom quickly before even leaving.  Upon arriving at home 3 of our group became fairly sick including vomiting, stomach aches, diarreah and just a nice feeling of malaise.  Would not return for free."}
{"text":"The food here is mediocre... it does not look how it does on the commercial thats for sure! BUT what does now-a-days anyway right? especially when it comes to fast food joints!!!  I'm surprised no one has spliced a photo displaying this, left being \"How it looks on commercial\"... right being \"How it really looks like\"  Our server \"Cathy\" was such a sweetheart!!! so genuinely pleasant and an all around wonderful human being!  She's originally from Santa Ana, cups were never empty, table always cleared.  If It was possible to rate service alone, it would be 5 stars all the way!!!  The steak was cooked perfectly, but the pasta was very old and stiff... the texas toast was DIS.GUS.TING! Not a fan of their mashed potatoes (and thats my fav food) their corn tasted stale.  On the flip side... The soda had lots of carbonation! + + + + + I am all for a place that has great tasting fountain soda!  Their Ham was delicious!   The kids love the fondu chocolate, white chocolate, and now--Caramel fountain!!  the strawberries looked beat down! they were either old or whitish red..   I, myself did enjoy their cotton candy!"}
{"text":"So 5 of us decided to go there for dinner last night spending $95 with the tip I'm a manager of a restaurant two of our children also work in the restaurant industry THEY NEED TO HIRE MORE PEOPLE  Dishes were dirty silverware was dirty food stations were dirty the so-called chef grilling the meat was by far the rudest person I've ever come in contact with in a restaurant we will never ever come back to this location 5 years ago this place was great it was even better when it was over on Ridgeroad you people need to step it up or shut it down"}
{"text":"This place good is decent, senior discount , they do get busy, I like the rotisserie chicken and the pot roast, meatloaf is decent, but cant have any lactose, fried shrimp is very good, the vegetables on the pot roast are very good.   Unsweetened iced tea, don't need sugar and a few item from the salad bar.  I am going there 2-3 night a week Friday, Saturday and and sometimes Sunday's  My server Rachel is the best and the main/only reason I go there so much. She works very hard, always makes sure I am fine and has a lot of regulars. Rachel is most definitely a very sweet hard working young lady.   WARNING TO ALL 2 AMENDMENT PEOPLE. THERE IS A NEW BLOND HEAVY  SET WOMAN MANAGER (Jessica) IN THERE, VERY STRICT,ALL SHE DOES IS SIT DOWN WITH THE REGULARS AND EAT, IF SHE DOESN'T LIKE YOU , YOU ARE IN TROUBLE. i WAS JUST THROWN OUT OF THERE BY THE POLICE FOR OPEN CARRYING , IN WHICH WHEN I ASKED , I WAS TOLD IT WAS FINE.  BEWARE THEY DO NOT LIKE GUNS IN THERE!!!!!  There is also cashier Donna look out for her, she is a back stabber  Stay away, you will thank me later   I used to go there 3 times a week Friday Saturday and Sunday and never been let down, place gets packed  Used to go to one in south Florida  which had more variety, but since they are franchised , cant go to wrong. They had real good off the bone turkey, they don't have it in this location"}
{"text":"I have to say- it's really good! I like it because the food is always fresh- it doesn't sit for hours. The rolls are to die for, and there are a lot of choices!!! What else is nice, even if it's a long long line out the door- it moves very quickly.  Go here right meow!"}
{"text":"Some of the foods they had went beyond buffet food standards, but some fell flat and weren't too great. We got in quick and they sat us down on a night where the line was going outside of the door! The way they had the line set up was interesting, but it managed to work out for everyone! The desert was a bit on the sweeter side, but majority of the service was pleasant!"}
{"text":"This is one of those places I've seen on tv commercials over and over again. It drove me nuts that I had to go eat here! I drove by here on Sunday and the line was ridiculous! The line was into the streets. I decided to try again last night around 8:30 and it wasn't a wait. Walked in and quickly got a table. The Golden Corral is a much better version of hometown buffet. For $12 I'm not coming in expecting Michelin star food, but I was pleasantly surprised by the buffet. The food actually tasted good. The service was exceptional with a very attentive staff.  Steak was cooked to how you asked for it. The fried chicken nice and salty. The dessert bar was probably my highlight. Cotton candy machine, soft serve, ice cream, chocolate fountain , and tons of other goodies. I do recommend this place to hometown buffet fans. I also recommend coming here on an off night to avoid the crazy lines.   Recommendation: It's a buffet .. try everything! (especially the steak and everything from the dessert bar)"}
{"text":"Went for lunch on the first day it opened. Drinks were in the front before you pay. I got a green tea, and I saw Hochata, so I got a second cup for Hochata. As we were paying I asked the cashier, were the drinks charged individually, by that I meant was I being charged for two drinks instead of one drink, she said it was included in the price, I took it as I can drink anything I want for ONE price. Later on, I checked the receipt Hochata was charged separately for $2.49. If I have known I had to pay for Hochata, I wouldn't have got it. They should have a sign informing the consumers regular soda drinks one price, otherwise there is a charge for the rest of the drinks, we were not charged for coffee, not sure if it was included in the price of the meal.  That was just the only complain I had, but everything else was excellent. The wait staffs were very friendly and very very tentative. The food were hot,  very tasty and very fresh too. They actually made the cakes, grilled the chicken and pork chop and chopped the salads at the front so the food were very fresh. Over all GC is way much better than HomeTown Buffet in every way.  I will now dine at GC than HTB. If the service and the food maintain at this high standard, I will definitely come back again and again, I have been waiting for a Golden Corral restaurant in this area ever since I saw their adds a few years back.  We kind of stop going to HTB lately, cause the quality of the  food and selections, and the service were kind of sub-par."}
{"text":"I never thought I would say this...but Golden Corral rocked!  I don't know if it was this particular location, or if I was just super famished...but the food was plentiful and delicious.  I'm a little bit of a food snob...but I was pleasantly surprised with my dining experience at Golden Corral.  Why was a self-proclaimed \"food snob\" dining at the likes of Golden Corral...?  My dear, sweet little nephew wanted to treat his aunt to a special dinner. Awww, how cute is that?    Although his mom, my sister, didn't think I would enjoy it, I enthusiastically embraced my special time with my nephew with open arms...er...open mouth and stomach:)  And even though I am dabbling in the world of vegetarianism (it's not a cult, it's a movement that is slowly taking over the world and individual's minds...hee hee), I was very satisfied with my food selections.  Starters: I enjoyed a wonderful spinach salad   \"Real food\": scrumptious dinner roll(s)...hee hee, chicken noodle soup (sans any observable chicken), fresh tasty fruit, greens, fried fish (don't recall if it was catfish or tilapia) and shrimp (okay, okay, I'm more of a veg-curious gal...I skip out on meat but I eat seafood)  Dessert: yummy bread pudding, freshly spun cotton candy, and the obligatory rice krispie treat covered in chocolate from the chocolate fountain (I say \"obligatory\" because I didn't really want any chocolate...but I just couldn't pass up the chance to dip my treat in the fountain of coco goodness:)  The total bill came to around $18 for two adults, two children and 1 toddler.  You can't beat that!  And to make our visit even better, our server Sandra (Sondra?) was exceptionally kind, friendly, personable, and attentive to our needs.  Overall: Me want more Golden Corral. Me likey!"}
{"text":"Hadn't been in years, decided to come based on nostalgia and I was so indecisive on exactly what I had a taste for but I was starving, and my go to Basil wasn't open, so why not try the place that has everything right? Wrong. Bad decision.  Most of the food was greasy and just not well prepared. The medium \"steak\" was tough and dry. The fried chicken was just ok. I did try out the salad bar and I was pleased, but you don't come to a buffet and pay 12 bucks for a salad.  The desserts were all terrible and clearly made with cheap ingredients. The chocolate fountain was weak as you could tell they tried to thin it out by cutting it with oil or something. The frozen yogurt was tasteless. Oh, but those fresh hot rolls were great! Good thing I can get great, fresh, hot rolls at other places because I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"The food is not bad, not great, but lots of it. I am a sucker for the pot roast, which is always nice and tender. We have gone to this one in Gastonia several times because we live in west Charlotte, it is less expensive than the locations in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Worst place ever!  Dirty, rude employees, empty chafing dishes, food looks and tastes HORRIBLE!  Don't waste your money.  It also doesn't seem as though management cares, you never see them!  Worst chain restaurant ever!"}
{"text":"We have been curious about this place and to my surprise, it is where Acapulco  use to be. The line lasted for about 20 mins. from the entrance door. The soda machine were placed before the cashiers so no one will ever ask if you want a drink and most people think it was free but they ended up paying for it. I did not find the food great, ordinary as it seems.  The sign above the salad bar say \"we get our vegetables from the crate, not from the freezer\" but my wife got an old, over ripe watermelon, kinda like Bestway Supermarket thing ha ha ha."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Food was awesome. I've never been to this one and not from this area but I enjoyed it. Food was constantly coming out, steak and prime rib was on point. The server Santiago was coming back frequently taking our plates and refilling our drinks.   Happy customer thanks!"}
{"text":"Came in at around 530pm on a Monday. Place was clean. Waitress was very nice. The food is good as far as the roast salad and rolls. Everything else doesn't have much flavor. Also I wish the food was hotter."}
{"text":"Its overrated. Big line. Average food, service, drinks. Cost for 3  adults for dinner on saturday around $57.48. Nothing special. Move on people nothing to eat here!"}
{"text":"Wow, so we went here on our way home from a Wickenburg day trip.  We were there at lunchtime on Saturday March 5th. The food was alright, some items cold like they had been sitting there too long. My biggest turnoff was this... I went to the restroom prior to getting back on the road. The filthy, disgusting ladies room was truly appalling!! Feces in toilets and on the seat, some unknown yellowish liquid on the floor, disgusting sinks too... I wanted to vomit. If this is the condition of the restroom, what does the kitchen look like?"}
{"text":"Okay,I will start out by saying that the location for this couldn't possibly be worse.Right in the heart of the ghetto,so you can imagine what kind of people frequent this place.Started out waiting in the line which was all the way out in the parking lot.We waited for about 45 mins.Once inside they had a drink station to get your own drinks while continuing to wait in line.I saw a guy pick his nose before touching the glasses for the drinks.Finally we made it to the register.20 something dollars for 2,pretty reasonable.Our server sat us at a dirty table.I went to grab a plastic kiddie plate and felt uncomfortable getting the silverware out of a bin that every one else's hands have been in.Some of the food was actually pretty good if you can get to it.These people acted like wild animals at this buffet.I then saw a guy drop a pair of tongs and put them back on the rolls.Gross! Parents let their kids fill up on cotton candy and run wild.Not a very pleasant dining experience,and I will not return.If they happen to build another one somewhere else,I might consider trying it."}
{"text":"We're back!  we had so much fun the 1st time we came back for more. As we entered, memories of our last visit begins to kick in as we pass the food stations to our table, I feel the excitement and my appetite ready to answer the call.  The overall appearance of the restaurant is clean. The variety of \"Home-cooked\" food for one price is incredible. Everyone will find something they like or they are not very hungry. Huge selection of salad. I especially enjoyed the cod fillet fish, breaded okra, sweet corn on the cob, the baked sweet potato wrapped in foil and the best brussel sprouts I ever tasted!  Sound familiar? There is a bakery so the desserts are made from scratch and fresh. I had a few marshmallows soaked in the chocolate fountain and finished off with decaf coffee. Thoroughly enjoyed our 2nd journey. Enjoy the photo's my friends :)"}
{"text":"Is the AC on? It felt like we were outside. Sunday dinner with my sistee, they definantly took their time making the food it was good. Very packed of course because sunday dinner. The chocolate fountain and carmel was awesome. It felt real crowded inside. The workers seemed to be on break because our plates seemed to pile up. The waiter that wasnt even in our area Justin was very helpful he came an cleared our table and provided refills."}
{"text":"Well the food was good. Kept their buffet well stocked and fresh. They also made the transition from breakfast to lunch very well, even though we only ate breakfast.   Waitress was not friendly and let our coffee time after time get cold. We always had to ask to get a refill. We had finished our plates and she stacked them on the table and just left them there. All while we were eating dessert. So service was a real downer.  Their desserts were incredible. Never thought I'd say that about GC.  I gave it 2 stars because I'm high on service. This place just didn't adequately provide even mediocre service. Just come for the food and try to ignore your waitress because 9/10 they are ignoring you."}
{"text":"Golden Corral, you finally made it back to Vegas!     I have to admit, I'm a fan of this standardized, controlled, family buffet, but this location is still undergoing growing pains of a new business. and it shown on my visit today.  Maybe, it's unfair to compare this location to the one in Hespria, because that location been open for awhile, but this is what the Las Vegas location need to strive for to earn my next star.  I believe Golden Corral has earn a reputation of being a pretty good family buffet value around the United States, and their streaming fountain became a great niche for them.   Even though, Las Vegas is still the buffet capital of the world, and has some of the nicest buffets on the planet.   You would think, why would Golden Corral come back here?   Well, if you think about it, there was room for Golden Corral to comeback to Sin City, because of the ever increasing prices and the steep nose dive on food quality at some of our casino buffets; and this alone has made it simple for Golden Corral to re-enter the market.  Upon pulling up onto the parking lot from Lamb Blvd, you could see there was a pretty long line going into Gold Corral lobby, but surprisingly the wait wasn't too long at all.   Like all Golden Corral, you would get your drink before paying for your meal, and head into the dining room.  This is where the stars start falling down, because of the mass chaos that going on in this restaurant  Like all first week of a business, you'll see a overstaffed of employees, but there was no real control of the workers in this restaurant.   My waitress, Deborah, a nice older Mexican lady was the only person that was working in my section, and no one was helping her at all.  From what I notice, Deborah was handling nearly 12 tables, and she was doing a heck of job, but watching the others around her was almost unbearable to watch.   It seems like that five minute huddle of the six bussers, who were hanging out near the drink station had a better agenda of not helping anyone.  Come on guys, let get with it, and help each other in this restaurant  I was kind of bummed that this location didn't have my warm bacon dressing for the Spinach salad, and not to mention the kitchen staff wasn't moving quick enough to restock a few items such as mash potatoes, fried rice, and sliders.  On a good note, the fried chicken and peanut butter fudge was pretty good.   Come on Golden Corral, get the warm bacon dressing or I\"m never going to come back to this location!   That alone makes me come back to you!!     I\"m sorry to give this location a three star rating, because they need to earn the fourth star like Hespria.    I'll be back in a couple of months, and hopefully this location will have worked out the kinks by then."}
{"text":"My friends, sit down, I have a story to tell you.  After a wonderful day out frolicking in and around the city, my colleague and I decided it was time to eat.  We also decided that we would eat like gluttons and if we were, we didn't want to spend a ton of money.  And yes, my friends, we know when you sacrifice price, the quality of food isn't going to be top notch.  So what, who cares.  We arrive, we pay, we sit, we devour.  Halfway through our time there, and about my third plate in, I decided to venture over the station that is situated right in front of the door.  I look at the register and notice a large party waiting to be seated.  I become puzzled at how they are dressed.  Suits and dresses, much too dressy for such an establishment.  I think about it for a minute and ponder that maybe they came from a funeral, being that it was a Thursday.  I go back to my table with my plate of food and tell my colleague what I had seen and we don't really think much of it until we see the bride and groom.  o_O  Not what you usually see in a chain buffet restaurant or for a regular Thursday for that matter.  These two were dressed to the nines, full train and veil and him in a white tux.  And this wasn't a small wedding party either.  I suppose they were housed in what could be considered their banquet room, fancy.  I mean how much do you love your bride if you decide to hold your wedding reception at a Golden Corral?  Asides from that delightful tale, I doubt that I will return.  Some of the people preparing the food kind of scared me.  They all had summer teeth."}
{"text":"Nothing in this buffet was even half decent. I'd choose any Casino buffet over this one. Everything is cold & old. I only had my drink refilled when I asked after it had already been empty for several minutes. The dessert options were limited and none of them were worth the calories. It is also small, & dingy. It doesn't look clean at all in here. Also, I didn't want to buy a soda but the water that came out was pink because they had not cleaned their nozzles. Water ran out the same nozzle as the fruit punch. Yuck! Never again!"}
{"text":"First thing they do is get your drinks...but NEGLECT to let you know THEY ARE NOT INCLUDED in your meal cost. At $11.50 for dinner the least thy could do is include the damn drink.   I also do not appreciate the staff speaking Spanish."}
{"text":"My family and I drove here from Green Valley , there was a line up and it moved fast . The staff was very friendly and the waitress came around several times and replenished drinks just as quickly. The fried chicken was awesome and the sirloin steak very good. Good salads and the roast beef was very tender. The desert bar was excellent . It's a nice family orientated place away from the casinos for the locals . The restaurant is big , good parking and bright .  Some people have made disparaging comments about the area  and that is unfortunate .  I hope they are a success and open a few more around town."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice and both times I ended up getting very sick. Although the dinner and lunch prices are cheap, it doesn't make up for the lack of quality in their buffet. The plates and silverware were very dirty and the food was terrible. The service was consistent and friendly but that's pretty much the only positive thing I can say about this place. Didn't learn my lesson after coming here the first time, but I definitely won't be coming again for a third time."}
{"text":"Been here before.  The food and service is always good.   Good home cooking.   Wish they had booths.   But still ok."}
{"text":"Prepare for a long line when you go to this restaurant at dinner time. There will be a long queue but it will move very quickly. What's best about this restaurant is they offer you a real American buffet variety that includes never ending salad, steak, soup, dessert. But last night we encounter a very moody waitress because there's just too many table that she had to handle all at the same time. I guess it's not her best day after all. Overall if you're very hungry and can eat elephant, this would be your best choice to get never ending steak fiesta."}
{"text":"After staying in Phoenix for almost a week. Golden Corral was dinner tonight, and was this place busy,busy,busy... I thought Golden Corral was worst in Gallup NM, nope this place is worst. Surprise they kept most food full, only thing that was empty twice was the mashed potatoes. So I didn't eat any as I normally would choose that. Steaks were good, medium rare was perfect and juicy. Clam chowder wasn't the best, but was ok. So if you choose this place be prepared to eat at a full house. Place was packed servers were on top of everything, and kept our drinks full. So this place is a recommend."}
{"text":"Step right up and barf away! If you are looking for an effective binge and purge weigh loss plan this is the place for you!   First let us entertain you in our line of agony while one person gets your drink and takes your money. This thrill ride of a line only lasts 10 minutes if there is only one family a head of you.  ( and its included in the price)  Next imagine the look on your dates face when you hand her a clean plastic plate and silverware with crusty residue on it.  But don't worry. The residue doesn't show up on the knives because there are no knives to be found. ( Awesome)  Now once you cross the room dodging folks and napkin debris on the floor you can make way to the buffet! Imagine all the nostalgia you will feel when you go up to the buffet and what should be a mix of baked fish, chicken, and meats. If a selection of stale breakfast items! ( left over from Monday morning brunch buffet?).   Feat your eyes on crusty eggs, syrup that has congealed, and other things you experience in the government lunch program in your old elementary school.  Cheese sandwich anyone?   Not into breakfast? Why not grab a slice of gristly, crunchy ham or nom descript fried chicken?  Then when you have had your fill of such wonders head to the chocolate fountain where the cute little rug rats who picked their noses are sticking their fingers and licking it.. Hmmm hmmm can't wait to have some of that.  So like I said. Best diet plan out there. You come in, loose your appetite, and what you are you loose in the parking lot.   Awesome!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Golden Corral in California and it's the same thing here. Food is pretty good. You have a huge variety. Mexican, Asian, American, and then there are the basic salad bars and soups. I tried the chili and it wasn't very good. It didn't have the right spice it just taste thrown together.   The dessert bar is probably the best part. The have a chocolate fountain that you can dip an assortment of things in, strawberries, marshmallows, even fudge. (Chocolate on chocolate, I know!!!) this one also had a caramel fountain with apples and you can but the other things under too. But my favorite thing is the cotton candy.   Our waitress was pretty nice but never asked us if we wanted refills, I can understand because it was packed in there. I still left a tip and when walking out all the employee said by and asked how it was. I like when people do that, shows they actually want your opinion.   I may go back if invited but never really a suggestion I would put in."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to take our kids here. Disgusting. Bad decision.  I am pretty sure that the owners of this chain, and the management hate people. Seriously it is as if they look at their customers and think of ways to reduce food costs and then watch the public dig in. I felt like I was part of a social dining experiment. It was degrading. I realized that the Golden Corral of 5 years ago in Kenosha Wisconsin felt...like a nice place. The food seemed to be prepared with alot more care and dignity. It could be times are changing or that the Gilbert AZ one is just a dive.  The grossest was the food all over the floor, not where you eat but just beyond the double doors. We had to beg for someone to refill our drinks and take some plates away. I felt bad that so many of our plates still had food all over them but I couldn't force my kids to eat that food. Also, most foods were mislabeled. All white chicken literally was legs and thighs. Sausage and gravy was actually beans and rice. Or it was just not labeled at all, it was a sign of disrespect to the customer.  It exuded the ambiance of total disregard to the customer. The little tiny burgers were hard as rocks. They reduced the salad section and its poor at best. The stuffing was wet and gooey. The mac n cheese was overcooked and watered down. I got my 3 year old some carrots and they looked cooked but were actually still very raw. There were 3 different trays of rice in different section,  and two of BBQ or Mexican flavored beans. Like they just filled space with the cheapest options. One type of fish was soaking in water and oil, I tried it. Nasty, it was really soaked with water and I never tasted anything so gross. my husband wanted a slice of pizza, but he watched and waited and the 3 pieces cold congealed slices of plain cheese pizza that were there when we arrived, were there when we left. It was never taken nor replaced. He said it was the first time that ever happened, because his default of choice when nothing else seems good, is the pizza. I told him he could have taken it all just in the hopes they would make more, but he wanted to wait for fresh. Ha. My kids enjoyed the little mini corn dogs, watermelon, peaches, the cotton candy and I enjoyed a bit of salad and fruit. I tried more, but cant say I'd ever go to there again.  I felt ripped off and ashamed to have taken my family there."}
{"text":"way better than the station casinos and the best part is the to go box..woooo woooo. sure, it was crowded and noisy but i kinda liked that. the food tho.  that was delicious and to me that is what counts.  poor wait staff is truly over worked tho and i hope they get paid well. i left Yai a big tip."}
{"text":"Busy. Busy. Busy.  Expect a 30-45 minute wait just to get inside.  Once inside, you feel not golden but corralled.  As I was winding around their line inside, the Disneyfication of eating could not be escaped.    In terms of food, the quality of ingredients is the same as any other buffet.  What makes them distinct is the processing and preparation of said foods.  Batch processing is the name of the game.  Do not expect culinary art.  If all you want to do is get your fill, then this is the place for you.  Dinner is $12.99/pp; drinks are an extra $1.99."}
{"text":"Being an all you can eat buffet I had some high expectations being that we had a wonderful experience at the Golden Corral in Tucson. It was a bad experience our server was not seen our steak was hard and tough it was like trying to eat a rubber tire. Would not go back here. Bad server she was no where to be found."}
{"text":"WOW! The choices are overwhelming!!  The line wasn't too bad, however they could have easily got another cashier  and took the line down immediately.  The place was thriving and crowded however not too crowded where it was irritating. This ofc was on a monday night.   There are so many food choices my head hurt haha.  They didnt have roast beef, any kind of ribs. They did have steak, chicken fish and anything else you could dream up. even two kinds of cheese sauce for awesome nachos or cheesy potatoes.  They had an awesome bread rack with rolls plumped glazed and soft from heaven! I could hear Angelic waves of music when I saw them.  I got too full to even enjoy desert. I did get one bite of red velvet cake down. They have a chocolate fountain, ice cream all kinds of pie and cotton candy machine.  Will go back on a weeknight only. Don't want to deal with any lines. They really need to make that system better."}
{"text":"Next time I want to feast like a queen on a budget I will go to one of those Taco Bell/KFC/Pizza Hut/Long John Silver locations and buy one of everything. That would be better than eating at Golden Corral."}
{"text":"For the price (11.99) place rocks my socks. Came here with hubby, we filled up, I'm talking 5 plates, 4 bowls, 10 dessert dishes. Friggen yummy. Then we went home lied in agnony. We def at all we could eat.   Heads up you want to get Edie for your waitress she's amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is the worst of the worst.  Bad food, dirty, over priced, hair in food, just bad. I will never go there again!  I wish I would have done a walk through before paying."}
{"text":"I never thought I would ever eat at Golden Corral for a very good reason. I just don't like buffets. Just the idea of bulk food being pushed out ASAP. It has been years since I have been to one. But today was my lucky day, Our aunt wanted to take us out for dinner after I was nice enough to help her at her apartment. Now this place has a lot of food! And a lot of people! I had their steak, medium but it was more like medium well and tasted like leather. Wanted a bun, but this one lady decided to take all twelve buns at once and left none! Asked her if she had enough, I can easily get another plate for her and take it to her table! She just looked at me? How rude! Anyway, I had some other food. They did look good, but just didn't taste that well. This place was a mess, tables were dirty, crumbs everywhere. But what do you expect! Only came here because of my aunt, this is not a franchise I normally go to. Only because I am not a buffet person."}
{"text":"For the last few visits, I have not been pleased with their overly salted foods. Something about the tastes of the roasts, fish and even the chicken just isn't right. I cook at home and we eat out a lot, so I think I can tell when things aren't right. They have the too sweet frosting on the carrot cake has always bothered me and it sits on the plate after it is scraped off. Finally on this visit, my husband said he didn't think it was up to par. They serve Pepsi, not Coke products, which I don't like. Why can't restaurants have it all? It will be a very long time before we darken their doors again."}
{"text":"This place used to be great when Ed was manager. It's gone way downhill.   Prices are extra pricey, and even more so on the weekends.   They turn people away before closing time so they can make sure they don't have to stay too late, I guess?  Food still tastes pretty good, but their soups are overly-salty. They do have a good variety of foods and desserts.   Drinks cost extra. They almost never have bottled water for sale like they used to."}
{"text":"Attended a seminar at the Golden Corral. It was dinner on someone else so I cannot say anything about the price. Not even sure what the price was, I would assume somewhere between $10 - 14. I was not even that hungry. The girl who took care of our table (served drinks and the like) was just fine, very attentive. All of the employees seemed to be very good, anxious to help the diners, cleaned up dishes quickly, cleaned tables quickly, seemed happy to have a job.  The food was plentiful and a good variety. I went to the salad bar and was pleased with the variety of options, different kinds of lettuce, lots of add on items both vegetable and dairy, about a dozen types of dressings. A good salad can be made and that in itself may have been worth the price (had I paid). After that I mainly walked around and looked at all they had to offer. Lots of different meats, chicken, steak, pulled pork, ham; some Chinese, some Mexican, some Italian; lots of vegetables both steamed and sauteed; many different potato dishes.  A sizable offering of food. Then there was an entire dessert section, cookies, pies, cakes, a flowing chocolate tower, strawberries, jelly, pudding, ice cream with numerous toppings, cotton candy.  In looking over the restaurant it is evident that it is a place for families as the largest age demographic was children. Most of them were scarfing down on the desserts, I saw some monster cotton candy sticks.  All of the food seemed fairly fresh, looked like the rotated new platters of food in quite frequently. The restaurant was clean, although a couple of sections had a rather musty smell, maybe from food ground into the carpet or  children making messes...who knows.  Good place  to go if you just want to stuff yourself for a few dollars, but I am not sure how you will feel a couple hours later."}
{"text":"The commercials for Golden Corral looked EXTREMELY APPETIZING !  Am not gonna  bore you with a lot of small details about the visit , i just want to tell you about the so called \" FOOD\"   The buffet presentation was great, lots of great color in their food and a large variety.  two thumbs up for the Dr. Pepper soda. I couldn't wait to try the Pot Roast and mash potatoes/w gravy. the pot roast was ok but had a starchy taste.  The mashed potatoes were GREAT cafeteria food it reminded me of the Sears dept store in Los Angeles, Ca off Soto St. back in the late 60's early 70's. the brown Gravy had me burping for a few hours, yes i kept tasting it HOURS later. the cheese bread was cold and dry   OMG, THE MEATLOAF was actually NO MEAT AT ALL it tasted more like soy and fillers... NO BUENO !!!! its more like MUT loaf if you dare give it to your pet.  fish in sauce was BLAND, BLAND , YUCK the breaded fish was deep fried 10 minutes too long ! Not edible. I had to actually SPIT OUT THE GUACAMOLE in a napkin, ITS NOT AVOCADOS its green but NOT AVOCADOS. I REALLY DONT KNOW WHAT IT WAS. very GROSS ! deviled egg had paprika sprinkled on top but the nicely whipped egg yoke was BLAND, BLAND, BLAND NO SPICES AT ALL. clam chower was watery and salty and NO CLAMS , it looked like chowder humm if you LOVE ENCHILADAS like i do OMG be in for a surprise... their filled with NACHO CHEESE SAUCE !!!!  Whos idea was this !!!!  REALLY PEOPLE @ GC !  I took a picture of my plate and you can see that id only took one bite from everything i was TRYING TO EAT.  and the napkin that was on the side of my plate was food that i had put aside because i didnt want the yucky stuff on my plate.   This was my FOOD EXPERIANCE @ GC...  PEOPLE , JUST KEEP DRIVING !!!! I never liked Hometown Buffet and i cant stand Golden Corral. Sizzler is ok..  Ok so heres the boring stuff if you care to continue reading my review.  The waitress came to our table and  ask \"hows everything \" and i spoke up and told her that this was NOT what we had expected she could seen that look in my face and said, i cant do anything about it but i will get the manager... The manager comes to our table and gives us his \"song and dance\" about \"US\"  being the first customers EVER to COMPLAIN about HIS food. (obviously he had his guard up before he came to our table) he bragged about how HIS customers have complimented him on HIS food. Hes sooooo surprised that our palate was different from others  ( HUHHHH really dude)  but hes absolutely right about that WE KNOW THE QUALITY OF GOOD FOOD !   This place is for people that dont care about Real Flavor in their food and for the most part i cant help but to think that people that like this slop \" DONT KNOW HOW TO COOK\"   I cant comment on the other foods only because we didn't dare  go back for another SLAP TO THE PALATE !   We were in and out of their so quickly , it was like being on an episode of  THE TWILIGHT ZONE.. It was indeed a frighting experience.   Its taken me longer to write this review than the actually time we were their .   The manager gave us a refund, but its not posting as of yet  in our bank account.  TWO THUMBS \"DOWN\" WAY, WAY ,WAY DOWN !"}
{"text":"This place used to have really reliably good buffet food. However in the last two years it has really dropped off and the food is only mediocre. The dishes are still dirty so you have to look for a clean plate, the floors are filthy, and even the employees uniforms are dirty. The entire restaurant has dropped in quality and is not worth the price anymore."}
{"text":"I shouldn't have gone here on Mother's day for my first time.  My review I am sure would be different if it was not such a mad house.    On the note of Mad House... this must mean other people really like it a lot cause it was super packed and just elbow to elbow.    The food to me was very generic, instant mashed potatoes, canned corn, over cooked rice ect.  The food did not bring a wow factor to me.  I did enjoy the chocolate fountain and the fresh fruit.   The salad bar was nice also.    It was extremely busy and hard to get in to the food. It was a little scary to walk with a plate of food because everyone was bumping into each other.  I did not see a drink soda fountain which was a down fall because you have to wait for the poor over welmed waitress that was loosing her mind with so many people to try to get to.    The floors where messy due to it being so packed and it made the place look nasty.    I will have to go when it is not a holiday to get a true opinion but my opinion when it is packed is that they should limit the people they seat on these days because it was horrible to try to eat there.  They do not hold up while with high volume unfortunately."}
{"text":"I love this golden corral , the food they have is very fresh and tasty . The staff is very friendly as well . when I eat I am never disappointed."}
{"text":"Two star rating because the server Carole was friendly and attentive. Food was very salty, steak was burnt and dry, buffet bar was dirty and I was there for an hour and never saw dinner rolls available. Ladies room had toilet paper everywhere on the floor and two employees used the restroom without attempting to clean it up. I wouldnt recommend, especially at the cost of $11.69 a person."}
{"text":"hello   my friends im  taking a dear friend of mine today here for a  Christmas  lunch  we  have been there before always get our  fill of food  save room for the sweets aswell well I wish everyon a happy holidays and a happy new years too"}
{"text":"Service is awesome but the food is not good at all, for the price the station casinos are million times better and cheaper. Will not recommended this place and will never go back."}
{"text":"DISGUSTING and UNSANITARY!!!  Is it possible to give a restaurant NO STARS?  I've gone to this restaurant a few times since inception at the Puente Hills Mall location and the more I come to eat, the worse the customer base becomes and the more disgusted I get.  While people were standing in line to be seated, they have already started eating with their hands - that means that bacteria they have on their hands will transfer to the serving spoons when to go for their seconds, thirds, fourths....  Then there's these people who are so happily thinking how cool it is to hold their strawberries before sticking them to the chocolate fountain... AGAIN, it's called \"spreading germs, people.\"  The staff sees these issues and don't correct or replace the food.  I will never go to this place again.  Manuel R. is correct, their name should be changed to GHETTO CORRAL."}
{"text":"Just terrible food. Service was okay but i couldnt eat one thing in that place. Stay away."}
{"text":"It's ok. The quality has gone down since it open. I'll rather go to a casinos buffet it's cheaper and free drink!"}
{"text":"Delicious ! Very crowded but the food is worth it. Very friendly staff except for one girl who forgot my sprite. The chicken is juicy and I tried all types of it. Try to come when it's not as busy."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! We were sitting next to a large family that knew everyone in the restaurant.  Our waiter was very attentive to them, but I had to mad dog him just to get rolls. Then he doesn't bring us butter or anything.  When my drink was empty he came over and asked do you want a refill or not? What??? Really. .it stinks in there and the food was sub par. Needless to say, he did NOT get a tip and I won't be going back anytime soon. Very disappointing.  The bathroom was disgusting!! They say you can judge the cleanliness of a kitchen by the restroom...I certainly hope this isn't the case!!"}
{"text":"We've been to this buffet a number of times since it opened and it's always been pretty decent. We hadn't been here for for quite some time and decided to go yesterday. I was pleasantly surprised.  I usually get the same things and they're always good. This time I found that there were a greater variety of items and I didn't have the same thing twice. In fact, after trying a little of this and a little of that I was too full to make it to the dessert area.  Everything was hot, fresh, juicy and tasted great. The ONLY thing I tried that was bland and flavorless was the white gravy. Which was too bad since the pork it was paired with was awesome."}
{"text":"The food is not good for the price you pay. The best thing about this place is the salad bar. The lines are long and the place is too small. The neighborhood is horrible and there are weird people lurking around the parking lot. I hope they build another one in a better neighborhood soon."}
{"text":"Bread rolls were puffy clouds of deliciousness.  The steak was well seasoned although some parts were a bit too gristly, but tasty still. Love their dessert bar.  Although you can place an order of grilled seafood, it takes about 20 minutes. But Mon-Thursdays for a limited time, two adults are $20. excluding beverages.  Worth it because kids have a variety."}
{"text":"My husband wanted to go here for his birthday lunch on May 1. Went to the register to pay and cashier said \"2 seniors?\". I said yes. We ordered drinks too and the cashier never mentioned the $6.95 deal. Just dreadful depressing personality of the cashier. It wasn't busy at all , she couldn't even muster a thankyou. She shouldn't be in front of customers. Didn't find out about the $6.95 deal til we sat down and her response was \"well, you said you were seniors. I hope her birthday is as pleasant as she made my husbands. Never again."}
{"text":"Lots of variety in their foods.but mostly American themed. Tried this great mandarin shrimp loved it. Great salad bar and lots of deserts!!! You must try the chocolate chip cookies with vanilla ice cream."}
{"text":"It's a buffet with lots of people, with lots of hands and arms reaching over food that you're eventually going to eat if you go here.. Food is so-so. I'll pass on buffets from now on."}
{"text":"Oh I heard these amazing things about the chocolate fountain!! Ehh im never coming back again...people are rude here...Cursing and talking loud around kids..ya no thanks!"}
{"text":"This rating is based only on cheap buffets.  This is the first time I've been to a Golden Corral.  I like the variety.  It definitely has more than Hometown Buffet does.  My husband was not with me, but he would love the fact that there is tons of meat and deep fried stuff. haha.  We had an excellent busser who always refilled our drinks and gave us the best sweet bread.    The place could be a little cleaner, but of course you can't always expect that at a buffet during the dinner hours.  Wish there was one close to me."}
{"text":"Food was so bad my daughter threw up and we all have the runs, the chicken served was more than just pink, not only that but it was ALL very blan. I have had MUCH better... So don't believe all the hype, and so not worth the 1 1/2 hour wait..... This place should be called the stable, because all of the mess and pigs that go there and eat the slop. It was very uncomfortable sitting under the bright lights and witness the mess.... What a disappointment !!!!!!"}
{"text":"Whew, what is it possibly to say adverse to a well-maintained Golden Corral with more than adequate selection and quantity of the days specials your own hand, temperature appropriately prepared and ready for your enjoyment.  How I began the night was with a healthy serving of BBQ ribs, a cut of grilled steak, a baked sweet potato, well garnished with butter and cinnamon and a vegetable combination of green beans, Lima beans, corn that was simply out of this world.  Needless to say that greedy sit in and I did have a second plate of some of these some of my favorites. I was able to top off this excellent eating Adventure with my signature chocolate and vanilla swirl cone and I was out the door running before Temptation led me to a third plate.  See you soon @GoldenCorral"}
{"text":"Have been here 3 times. All 3 times resturant was filthy.  Food is not as good as other golden corrals."}
{"text":"To Serve or Not Serve   Hello Yelpers   Recently,  I had a experience at a Golden Corral Restaurant that concerned me enough to write to their corporate office not once but twice.  After receiving \"no response\" I thought I might as well add this to my \" Yelp\" reviews\".  I believe it's incumbent upon management to put things right for any and all concerns a guest may have while dining at their establishment. I have never experienced Management at a corporate level fail to respond in a timely manner when a guest addressed a concern. With the vast amount of establishments to dine at one would think that the last thing management at any restaurant would want is to have a guest  leave unhappy or, in my case to never come back again.  Rather then writing a strategic rant, I have decided to attach the letter I sent to corporate headquarters.    September 23, 2013   Corporate Office of Golden Corral   I am writing this letter to discuss a recent experience I had at your Golden Corral restaurant located at 420 N Dysart Rd, Goodyear, Arizona (623) 925-9075.  I have visited this location many times and have always enjoyed the quality of food and superior service.  However, my latest visit to Golden Corral has me very concerned as a guest.     On Saturday, September 21 around 1130 A.M. I visited your restaurant to purchase a dozen rolls for a BBQ I was having later that day.  When I returned home and opened the box of rolls I noticed that the rolls were hard and somewhat overcooked.  I realize this has happened to us all at one time or another. Each of us has ordered food at a restaurant and gotten something that differs from our expectations to some degree. I appreciate that restaurant work is a very challenging business, and sometimes cooks and chefs can get caught up in a multitude of orders, all at the same time and the quality of a product can suffer.  I usually do not return food but I really wanted to serve the rolls at the BBQ so I went back to have the rolls replaced.   I arrived at the restaurant around 1:25 p.m and asked to speak with a manager (whose name I do not recall).  To be fair, the manager came over apologized and he offered a replacement dozen of rolls fresh out of the oven and advised it would be about 6 minutes. That was nice; my concern lies in the statement the manager made after he took the dozen rolls I brought back.  The manager asked if I had \"touched the rolls\" because if I had not touched the rolls they could be used to make \"bread pudding\".  At that moment I wanted to leave the restaurant and I would have left had the replacement rolls not came fresh out of the oven. My concern lies in the area of food, health, and safety issues.  Is taking returned food from guest and reusing it standard operating procedure for Golden Corral?   I am not an expert by any means in the area of food preparation.  However, I do realize that food safety is a scientific discipline and the proper handling, preparation, and storage of food is the only way  to prevent foodborne illness. Food can transmit disease from person to person and standard precautions should always be adhered to.  When you are a guest at any food establishment your thought is; the food ought to be safe, and the preparation of the food should be such as to avoid potentially severe health hazards, such as taking returned food from a guest and reusing that product.   I am not sure if I will ever revisit Golden Coral again but I know without a doubt that  I will never go back to your Avondale location.  The thought of reusing food that a guest returned is enough to keep me from coming back to that location.   Thanks  Dxxxx Gxxxxxxx  1xxxx W Xxxxxxxxx Ave  Xxxxxxxx,  Arizona  xxx-xxx-xxxx"}
{"text":"Good food for a buffet chain. Extensive salad and dessert section. Kids love love love the chocolate fountain and cotton candy.  Okay fine, you got me - even I love the chocolate fountain and cotton candy, happy? Best part of the place.  But need to bring up a few cons: - Dear GC... WASH YOUR SHIZ. ALL OF IT. I MEAN IT. plates, silverware, cups - everything, gross gross GROSS, all the time. I usually have to go through 3 or 4 plate selections before I find one without a speck of old food on it. get Kanye and his golddigger to roll up their sleeves and do the dishes in the back... they'd probably be better than who you have now.  - the whole 'get your drink before you pay' thing is so annoying. it slows the (always endless) line down, makes it hard for people to hold a drink while digging through their purses for money, and makes it hard for the waiters to have to refill the drinks FOR you during your meal.   Tips: - if you want to go for dinner and not have to wait a half hour or more: aim for 6 - 6:30pm. Any later, and you might as well end up in the line for Space Mountain at Disneyland."}
{"text":"Had seen GC adverts on TV for about three years and was bummed out that there was no GC in the area.   These ads were on some of the channels on Direct TV and was wondering why show these if no one can go to GC?  I figured one day they'll open one up locally and they are only showing commercials getting us ready to go when they open.  Driving on the 60 freeway to Fry's Electronics I could not believe my eyes, saw a GC billboard saying they are open in Industry.  Instantly I knew I had to go. Oh yeah I have a friend in Miami who goes to GC all the time.  So he said how good it was and when they opened here it was another reason to go.  Don't have to go to Miami for this!   We tried to go one evening but there was a line about 40 people deep out the door so we skipped.  Well today we got to go for lunch.  Line about 30 people deep out the door but we said let's go any way.   Took about 30 mins to get to the register then we sat down.    Was it all I expected?  Yes, I loved it so did my friend.   I saw some negative reviews, I didn't read them but from the lack of stars it's obvious some people didn't like the place.  Well the price was right and the food was great.  The employees there were very nice and helpful.  I can't see why I would not go again.  It's worth the wait in line in my opinion.   There is a good variety of food and deserts.  The fried chicken is perfect.  Golden crispy on the outside and really juicy inside.   I could go on and on about the different dishes.  I suggest you guys just go and try it out.  It's way better than Home Town Buffet.  What HTB has on them is they have an Icee Machine but so what, I love Icee but you know what the GC is far superior so I'll stick to GC.  HTB used to be really good though but over the years it started to become of less quality as it was years ago.  I hope HTB does well, don't get me wrong but GC is the place for me to be."}
{"text":"This is the first one in the entire state of Nevada, I've been told, and although I have been to these places before, this is clearly the best one I have ever patronized.  The food is terrific and the staff is superb.  Two of the very BEST servers are SHAVON & LASHUN; they are PERFECT!.  Overall, this was a wonderful experience for me and one I would heartily recommend to others.  My ONLY complaint is that their breakfasts are only served on Saturday and Sunday.  I wish they served breakfast, seven days a week.  Perhaps eventually, they will."}
{"text":"The food was decent for the price you pay, but the chocolate fountain and the dessert in general is amazing :D"}
{"text":"It's ok there I just feel like if I could cook it at home better why go out and pay for it.I'm not a fan at all but my kids love it there for some reason"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with my mom and my aunt, I was warned about a line outside the door almost always so I wasnt surprised about that, we eventually got in and the food was pretty good! talk about food coma! the only reason why I didnt give it 5 stars was because I wasn't happy with where they seated us, we sat near the desert area which may sound like a good thing if you have a sweet tooth! i think not! there was a line in front of my table the entire time! some children would even rest their plates on our table, it was pretty annoying i felt like people were watching us eating, other then that everything else went well :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here today for my free birthday meal...The meal was #awesome...A delicious variety of food! I love the fact, that I got a free birthday meal for joining the Golden Corral eclub...I think that's what it's called...Anyway, it was #awesome & our waitress, Lawanda, is very nice... It's the regular meal price that is ridiculously expensive...$8.99/meal...I remember about 10 years ago...A meal was only about $6.45...That was a better price...Is there a way to lower the price again?"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for some time because I have tried other locations out of state. I went during lunch, which happened to be 15 minutes before the price changed to reflect dinner prices. It also happen to be within the time frame of the Senior discount, so there were people everywhere. The food is a hit or miss. The employees could definitely do a better job keeping the floors clear. There was trash under the tables and the behind the food area did not look too clean. Overall, all you can eat for $10 isn't too shabby."}
{"text":"Drove by today, on a Monday, at around 11 am and saw that there was absolutely no line outside so we decided to come here for lunch. For those of you who have been here or live in the area, you know this is a miracle! The past few times I've driven by, the line was literally out the door and wrapped around the corner (over 50 people in line) and I've heard that you have to wait over 30 minutes just to get inside.   As far as the food goes, you get what you pay for, and you're paying less than $10 for a buffet, so it's A-OK. Compared to Hometown buffet, it's definitely better in quality. Everything tastes fresh and you can see the chefs cooking behind the counters.   The chocolate fountain and cotton candy are the icing on the cake and I also loved that they had butter pecan ice cream. As you can tell... I love desserts, and didn't care much for the food, but the cheesy biscuits were amazing! (Reminds me of the ones from Red Lobster.) Overall, a pretty good deal for the price."}
{"text":"I love buffets. But not this one. Its expensive. Its limited. Its crowded. And the food is subpar.  A group of friends and I decided on this place after another friend gave it a thumbs up. Ok, I thought. I love buffets.  First thing I noticed, more than five people standing in the front smoking. Like you have to shuffle passed them to get it. What if I had my baby with me? Or my family? Second, some woman was asking everyone to wash their car windows in exchange for diapers. SMH!!  So we go inside to a very crowded small one man register. I paid for two friends and myself. Plus three drinks??? $42.00 So letter me get this straight. This is a buffet but without self serving access to a beverage bar?? And I had to pay for it? Why am i here and not at old country buffet?   So we are seated. Not a bad atmosphere except for the large crowd. I went and collected my food. I got fried chicken and a side salad and bread roll to go with my iced tea. All crap, even the tea.  Worst chicken I've ever had. And its hard for me to not finish fried chicken down to the bone. Bit this fiscrace of a piece of crap just simply wasnt worthy for my stomache. Bland. Not that crispy. A little dry. Smelled funny. Bread was stale. Salad wasnt that fresh although it wasnt too bad. And tea was brisk which isn't tea.   In order to get refills I had to wait for waitress to come and do it for me cause im a baby who cant get his own drink? I didnt even try the dessert.   Overall not impressed. But I guess the dishes were clean and they had catfish off the grill. I didn't try it but it did smell good. If I were in a buffet mood, old country and home town are better selections. Also they are cheaper."}
{"text":"i do really like golden corral  fresh food if you like shrimp wow! they have jumbo size and if you like meat wow charbroiled steaks  and many other dishes not a bad deal at all. i give it a thumbs up!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to the Golden Corral in Las Vegas. We had went to another location in Arizona prior to our visit to this location. Here is our review.  The location/place: It is pretty large inside this location. As soon as you walk up to the door, you can smell the food from outside. When we arrived during lunch, the line was out the door, and it was packed inside. When trying to get your food, it is difficult to navigate due to the high amounts of people walking around. Overall, other than the crowd, it was clean, and the seating was pretty comfortable.  The food: The food is really good. Everything was fresh and tasted great. They have a salad bar, meat area, and dessert area with three fountains. They have a chocolate, white chocolate, and caramel fountain. They have strawberries, marshmallows, and other things that you can dip into the fountains. They also have ice cream and cotton candy. I like the great assortment of desserts rather just the same stuff that they have at the casinos.   The best foods that they have are the lasagna, rotisserie chicken, steak, roast beef, pizza, and the ham. Most of the food is good especially for the cheap prices.   I give this place 4 stars because it was worth the price they charge and I don't really have any complaints. Service was good, the waiters are really nice and they make sure you are properly taken care of."}
{"text":"Over $30 for my wife and I to eat here.  I would pay that for a buffet if the food was good, the place was clean, and the atmosphere was decent. Unfortunately none of this was the case.   When we arrived, the employee filling drinks announced she was going on break and just left and the people in line behind us had to wait an extended amount of time until the host actually went into the back and found someone else to pour drinks. A lot of the food was empty on the buffet and at one point there were 11 people standing waiting at least 20 minutes. for 4 or 5 items on one side of the buffet to get refilled.  They advertise \"steak the way you want it\" but all that was available was medium rare and the grill cook just kept yelling for the line to move and whatever you asked for, you got medium rare.  The food that was available was luke warm at best and the bourbon street chicken was cold.  The employees all seemed very angry and did not want bothered.  Did not see a manager anywhere.   Another issue was sorting through plates and silverware to find something clean.  There were food scraps and sauces left in the middle of the stack of plates and silverware.   Finally we decided to get yogurt for dessert, and the machine didn't even work correctly. It gave us soupy milk like yogurt which looked disgusting.   I've visited before and now after the \"re grand opening\" and can't tell if anything even changed. If anything it got worse."}
{"text":"This is my 3rd. visit to the golden corral in las vegas the food is good and the staff is really cool people I would recommend this place to my friends and family"}
{"text":"I thank you all for your reviews.  After careful reading,  we have decided to go to a known restaurant for our celebration.  We wanted to try this, but after your reviews, I think we won't.  We will go to Austin's Steak house in Texas station for the best crab cakes and steaks you have ever eaten.  Also, try the oyster bar at Texas Station, the seafood there is the best ever and the price is great.  Try the huge peel and eat shrimp,  YUMMY.    This place is dead to me.  LOL"}
{"text":"First start with the employees. All amazing, friendly, helpful. Atmosphere was perfect even the Guest where a delight. The food to my surprise (thought it would be like hometown buffet like in California.) But to my surprise the food was absolutely amazing. Never enjoyed myself so much at a restaurant. Ty Golden Corral"}
{"text":"Ahh Sun City: population who cares...the place you live to die.  This food is for the dying soul.  so if you're ready to go....itadakimasu! (japanese for bon appetite)"}
{"text":"Very unhappy with this buffet. They claim the \"Best buffet in America\". WOW, I certainly hope not.  Seafood spectacular was anything but.  4 items do make a spectacular, two of which were fried shrimp.  Up side: for $12 the food was tolerable.  DOWN SIDE: place was filthy. Food everywhere on floor, ground into the carpet - we were there for just over an hour and NO ONE cleaned the carpet even once.  Were they busy? Thursday about 6 pm, Steady business. Is this acceptable? NO. Having been in the business for over 25 yrs.- including  a busy buffet, I find this completly unacceptable. On the food line, at least 1/2 the items were empty the several times I walked the line.  All the cooks did seem to be enjoying  themselves rather than tending  to the line. The server was overwhelmed  by 28-4 tops that she was attempting to attend to by herself.  Staff training seemed to be non-existent as the busboy, when he finally showed up, seemed to have had no training at all. So: food - **; Service: Jenny- ****; Cleanliness - 0*.  I, personally will go hungry before considering this as a place to eat."}
{"text":"I'm beyond disgusted with the fact that the same servers who refilling our drinks are the same ppl fixing up the restroom without washing hands and coming out to the floor and refilling our drinks!!! I was ok until I witnessed that but our server is a true team player cus there is no way I would be doing all that work for under $5.00 tips or not she's not paid enough"}
{"text":"Finally came here and I thought it was mediocre.  The service was great with out servers really doing a great job.  I thought that the selection wasn't super great but there were definitely some highlights.   The steaks they give could be bigger but having the chance to go unlimited times cancels that. The food tended to be VERY greasy. When you see that the white rice is dripping in grease... you know all their food will be like that.  The selection was the usual going from \"Asian\" to some Italian, Mexican, etc. The dessert section didn't have a great selection.   The food can be much better and should have more of a selection.  Service was top notch. Price was too high for what is served (in comparison to the Station Casinos).   I might return again but it's not my first pick."}
{"text":"Family loves to come here for brunch. I used to really love this place. I highly recommended it first when I had my first bite but as time goes the flavor and its \"wow \" factor is gone. Now its just an average restaurant, family still comes here once in awhile catching a brunch or a dinner. Their a high on price, but I think with the selection of food its expected.  I would like to state that the servers are great here. But sometimes when youre caught between breakfast and lunch they just take out the breakfast portion out of the way, sometimes just while iam waiting on the line to get a waffle or something on the breakfast menu, and there is no way to get it back on the selections of food."}
{"text":"Very nice service and the food will make you feel like your at home.  Watch out for dirty flatwear ands plates."}
{"text":"I always seen this buffet on the tv commercials now I finally got to eat here awesome good food.... Bread pudding is awesome"}
{"text":"Yes this is basically a Home Town Buffet with a tad better food. I've been here twice so far on weekdays so I usually don't run into long wait times like others have said. The latest I've waited was 30 minutes. The second time I didn't wait at all. Service here is usually great and the waiters are pretty nice and attentive.   Anyway, for the price you're paying, the food here is decent enough. I actually like the steaks here since I can always ask for the part of the steak with the most fat on it. Yes I'm a fat-ass but damn it, a medium-rare steak with a lot of cooked fat is like heavenly to me in terms of flavor. Also, the fried popcorn shrimp and fried jumbo shrimp are pretty good. Especially covered with the tasty gravy meant for the mashed potatoes. Did I mention I was a fat-ass? I think there was a fried fish dish they had there that was pretty good as well.   I would avoid the Asian and Mexican style food since they're really really bland compared to the American style food. Honestly, that stuff is probably greasier than the fried chicken and shrimp they have. So eat American here.   Protip: As two of my friends found out, there's a good reason why cotton candy is suppose  to be all cotton like: when you crush cotton candy into a ball and eat it, you'll probably get diabetes from the massive influx of sugar into your system at once. Also, chocolate covered cotton candy isn't all that good either as my friend figured out.   My luck here has been good so far so I'm definitely coming back if I'm ever feeling like abusing my body."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner. Grilled food was great and staff there was attentive. Only discouraging what I saw with my own eyes.  Unattended kids all over the dessert area making it look unhealthy to even touch. So adults going there with your young ones. Go with them to the dessert area."}
{"text":"Place gave me fiery diaherea, but other than that its pretty bomb. Avoid the nachos, cheese sucks, the pizza taste like my pubes, you know what avoid everything except desserts and drinks. Alot of elderly migrate on sunday as well. Not sure why. Fun place."}
{"text":"awesome! My stomach isn't big enough for all the good food. waaaayyyy better than hometown buffet and that whole chain."}
{"text":"we waited for 11/2 hours to get in, two friends came in later, but we told the cashier and paid for the food already. friends showed up an hour later, we opened the exit door for them. a lady in pink asked my friend if they were paid. my friend said yes. then later as my friend was standing in line to get more food, the lady in pink pointed her finger to a waitress and asked if he paid for the two friends.  my friend could here what she said n felt very insulted.  the waitress came to our table, picked up our receipt and asked very nicely if it was our receipt, and told us that a lady wanted her to check if those two friends were paid. i asked the waitress if the lady in pink is a manager? she said no, maybe she was a customer. we were thinking: what the hell?? what kind of nosy lady is this?? then later the waitress came back and told us she was the owner's wife who comes once a while for a spot check.  not only she had a shit face, but a very nasty attitude. we thought the food was okay, for the price we could be a return customer, but we don't want to go back anymore.  NO RESPECT FOR THE CUSTOMERS FROM THE OWNER. We are not thefts!!!  the owner should learn from their waiter and waitress to provide better customer services!!!"}
{"text":"I choose this particular one over the rest because it's friendly... Both customers and employees are nice.  That means a lot to me, in a world of selfish people.  I go the extra mile for everyone here when I go because I have a feeling lots of people here feel the same way."}
{"text":"I hadn't been here in years but used to be my favorite weekly place to go when I lived closer.  It seems they changed a few menu items like removing the fried chicken livers.  Oh well, those were so good.  They added a new item: Smoked Beef Brisket.  It is so good when I add in spicy bbq sauce.  It takes just as good if not better than high end smoked bbq places in Scottsdale.  And this was served during Saturday lunch  I have to try their new steak, which is only available for dinner.  Previously their steaks suck.  It totally lacked flavor and the cut wasn't very good.  The fried chicken here is some of the best in town.  Hot, fresh, juicy, and delicious.  You can tell it is made fresh.  Not sure about all the negative reviews.  If it was doing that bad, you'd think the place would be vacant.  Not so.  The place is packed to the bone and this place is huge.  All rooms were opened and most seats were taken.  For a place that people rate 3-stars, why is it doing so well?  Lol  The tartar sauce here is good and goes great with their baked tilapia or fried catfish.  Both are good."}
{"text":"Always crowded always a mess, kids playing in the food. Not like the other ones that I have been to."}
{"text":"Stopped by today about 2:30pm and surprisingly had a very fresh selection to chose from! They had my favorites like mashed potatoes, fried chicken, okra but new items like fried ravioli, sesame chicken, sliders and grilled cheese. So much food! Place was clean. First waitress was a bit rude because we moved two tables together for our party of 6, but other than that, service was great!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying i miss ponderosa...Im ashamed to call golden corral an american buffet The food quality is very bad..everything is cheaply made will not return"}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch. You pay for what you get. The food quality is not that great. A lot of the foods were not replenished in a timely manner. Our server was Tammy. She fail to clear our dishes from our table as we went to get our different course meals. There were dirty cups and silverware on the other tables in our dining area where the people have already left the restaurant. One visit was enough."}
{"text":"Bitter disappointment, for the price, we could have gotten much better food.  I will say, our server \"Tonya\" was very good.    Much of the food on the buffet looked as if it had been there for many days (I'm not exaggerating). There were devil eggs with yellow crust on top.  They had marshmallows and strawberry's skewered for the chocolate fountain but didn't have the fountain going, they did have some chocolate you could dip in.  I grabbed one of the marshmallows and it crunched when I took a bite, I thought this must be what it's like to eat styrofoam.  The guy on the grill had about 6-8 people backed up, I would have been about number 5 in line but he wasn't even going to look my way or inquire as to what I needed until he got the group in front of me handled....I'm guessing they wanted triple charred, extra well done meat....I wanted medium rare steak and some ribs, which were ready to be put on my plate.  We prayed on the way home that we didn't get food poisoning.  Stay away, this place sucks."}
{"text":"Man this place is GHETTO!  First of all I come during the middle of a weekday (Tue) around 2pm and it is full of people! I guess nobody has a job to go to ? Plus it's not in the best neighborhood either.    After I sat down and went back for seconds, someone came and took all my silverware and took my receipt too. I was not done! WTF?  By that time I was losing my appetite due to the most disgusting people walking around in there. Looked like a freakshow!  2 extremely obese patrons walked by, and some of them looked like ex-cons. Yikes!  I come back to my table and they cleared everything again!!  Jeez!  And nobody ever came to offer me a drink refill.  I cant imagine how this place must be on weekends if a weekday was like this.  Food was just ok.  Salad choices were good. They have Chicken Ceasar Salad which was good. Mini burgers were ok. Desserts didn't impress me."}
{"text":"Sooo its Friday night, We were in the mood  for quick, easy and variety. We ended up here.  Not too bad,  they have been trying to improve the menu/buffet offerings. So far, so good!  I see the changes and I like themthe steaks are better cuts and grilled decently. The fried  chicken was good.  The veggie offerings are my favorite.. some good ole fashion southern inspired offerings. The beverages are not included with buffet,  THEY SHOULD BE!!!!  Overall decent!"}
{"text":"There were some things that Golden Corral gets very right, and there are other things that they get very wrong.  I realize however, then when you try to crossbreed a southern buffet chain, with California-type restaurant quality standards....things can get a bit awkward.  Imagine Honey Boo-Boo shopping in Beverly Hills....you get the idea.   I would imagine that much of the food and atmosphere decisions come not from the owners of the specific franchise in the City of Industry, but from the Golden Corral corporate office, who makes decisions based on their own standards of what is acceptable to serve.  FOOD:  I don't know if I have seen such a juxtaposition in a buffet - usually I find buffet food to either be all great, all terrible, or all mediocre.  There were some GREAT choices here....Hush Puppies (rare to see at a buffet!), Texas Toast (which I could just eat all day long), sauteed mushrooms, Bourbon chicken, all different kinds of salad options, hand scooped ice cream (also very rare to find in a buffet!), the chocolate fountain (with surprisingly good tasting chocolate!), and even cotton candy (especially great for the kids).  Now the bad....all of the Chinese food options!  I am not one who has particularly high standards for Chinese food, but dear Lord!  Do you know the expression \"chewing the fat\"?  Well - now you can!  Just put some of their Chinese chicken options on your plate and start chewing!  The low quality of the Chinese options is surprising to me, especially since this buffet is located in a community heavily populated with Asian Americans.  This is what makes me think that food decisions are strictly made on a corporate level.  Avoid the Mexican options too.  We here in Cali know our Mexican food - and you can't call this Mexican food.  I don't know what kind of food you would call it....  ATMOSPHERE:  Of course because it is a buffet, we know the atmosphere is going to be (1) Crowded and (2) Loud.  So that is completely acceptable.  The buffet area got a little hectic when the steaks were coming out, and the people started lining up.  Even that was acceptable.  However, the booths had absolutely no cushion, so you are just sitting on hard plastic.  (Maybe this is to discourage you from staying too long?!)  Ouch!  SERVICE:  A+!!!!  The guys and gals that work here in such a stressful and busy environment sure have a great attitude!!  Everyone was so friendly and attentive, and service was given with a smile.  Our server was prompt refilling our drinks, and clearing our plates.  And not just our server, but every server in there had the friendliest dispositions!  I see so much potential in this place, but unless they can break away from their food quality products/standards set by their corporate office, they will just be mediocre.  SUGGESTIONS:  This place can be very crowded, with a line that can stretch out the door on the weekends.  Go early in the week (lunch if possible, but dinner is fine too) to avoid the crowds.  Oh yeah, be ghetto and bring your own bottle of either Tapatio or Sriracha chili sauce - you may need it, since much of the food lacked so much flavor!"}
{"text":"Quality and variety of food is excellent. Staff and omelette chef are very friendly. Great value. Well managed. Everyone is helpful and will be happy to bring you a coffee or anything else you need. I don't get the negative reviews. Look at the line outside and you'll see this place is a hit! So glad to have a Golden Corral so close by!"}
{"text":"Golden Corral is awesome for its variety of food but they are just always packed with not enough tables and not enough staff. They changed the meatloaf recipe bathrooms were dirty kids were biting jello tops and putting them back on shelf for other people to eat. This was the worst eating experience I've had this year!"}
{"text":"On 2/17/13, I took my family here to eat. This would have been my first visit here. Upon our arrival, I knew there was going to be a long wait because it was Sunday afternoon. However, after 5 minutes of standing in line we were asked to leave without a valid reason. One worker said they were running out of food but another said their bathrooms were not working. When I was standing in line I noticed their soda machine was leaking all over the floor near the front of the line. There were paper towels covering it up. Also, for the little bit of time we were in line, the line barely moved. I wont' be going back to this location!"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner, there were a lot of people but it didn't really feel packed. The cashier was very friendly and most helpful. Along with that, the server was great also, she always cleared the plates in a timely fashion and asked if we needed anything. But, what's really important is the food. Which was absolutely delicious! The rolls, meatloaf, and Sesame chicken tasted fantastic. And, don't even get me started on the brownies. The bottomless pit in my stomach is satisfied, for now.  So 10/10 I will absolutely be back to the corral of golden standards."}
{"text":"As long as you don't go to often the is pretty good for what all you get. The BBQ pork special they've got going was very good compared to many BBQ only places. My big complaint tonight was that the waitress while clearing plates and took my coke with her and never brought one back or didn't even see her after that. Also I asked for the Senior Discount, it does start at 60, and didn't get it. But just didn't notice till I got home. I'm still giving 3 stars instead on 2 as the BBQ and fried chicken was spot on."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to begin....  We went to Golden Corral because we somehow got a gift card. We decided to take my in laws and niece with us as well.  I learned a huge lesson - do NOT go on a Saturday night!  It was insane - a long line to get in, children running around everywhere, buffet was a mess.     I won't comment on the food that much. I obviously did not expect a Tremont dining experience. However, I will say that the baket potatoes were cooked well, mac n cheese was tasty enough, and I enjoyed the sweet potato fries. My family members enjoyed the chicken and chicken pot pie.  My niece loved the ample options for dessert.  This place is a child's dream - 2 chocolate fountains, cotton candy, and ice cream!   My main complaint was the service.  It was very busy, but it took a long time to get a refill on my water.  Our table was still a little dirty when we sat down. My husband got buttery corn juice spilled on him when the cook threw the corn on the cobs into the pan.  The cook apologized, but it was annoying. Guess who did a load of laundry right when we got home....  I would not go back unless given a gift card or was forced due to family obligation. I would prefer to spend the same amount of money at my local Mexican restaurant.  However, for people who likes buffets and traditional American cooking, get ready to pack on the pounds."}
{"text":"They serve 2 week expired yogurt. If they're willing to use expired products that have the label printed on them, imagine how old the food is they prepare."}
{"text":"We go here every now and again. There is always something enjoyable to find and eat. And the good thing is, if you don't like what you pick, you're not committed to it.   The breakfast is one of my favorite times to go, because I like to get eggs, pancakes, and french toast--but in small portions. I also, even though I shouldn't, try a little of their cinnamon bun...their mouth watering, icing drenched, artery clocking cinnamon bun. Sooo good.   I also love the new chocolate waterfall--even though a hate seeing all the little kids go up to it and stick their fingers in...Yuck!"}
{"text":"I Called for prices because they are not posted on the website. I asked about prices and was put on hold. 8 minutes later, I'm still on hold. I decided to call from my other phone, I asked the same question. Got my answer right away. Then I asked why I'm still on hold for the same information, for over eight minutes. I got an \"I'm sorry we had a rush\" Good way to lose customers even before the step through your door."}
{"text":"Golden Corral often gets a bad rap, because some of their offerings are iffy. I agree and believe all would be better served if those were eliminated. When it comes to holiday roast turkey, however, I have to tell you that they do the best job of anyone else out there. It's tasty, and the potatoes, gravy, stuffing, sweet potatoes, and carrots that it comes with are all pretty damn good. Best of all is the lunch price. It simply can't be beat"}
{"text":"-Update One  Many of the things were removed, moved, and/or decreased in quality since my first review. I am disappointed, but would still recommend it."}
{"text":"I've been here two times for lunch and I must say it's been good. yes, long lines, lots of people, but after you've gotten your food, the taste isn't bad at all. The mini cheeseburgers, liver and onions, enchiladas, Chinese food, etc. all have been at least par to better. I mean, they are not too greasy, breaded, or fake tasting. The salads are also fresh and they have a great variety. The deviled eggs are like homemade. And the desserts are just plain sweet and fattening. For a buffet, it's better than most, and for the price, it can't be beat. Lots of good stuff; amazingly, I ate less because for the variety I got, with smaller portions, I felt satisfied."}
{"text":"I've only been to Golden Corral twice, and both times, I was very pleased that to see that the selection of of food was so big. And although I've never tried the cookies, I here from a reliable source that they are one of a kind. There are only two complaints: First, its very crowded. When you plan to eat there, prepare for very long lines and tight spaces. Second, the asian rice tastes a little weird, so I would stay away from it."}
{"text":"Food wasn't as great as I expected. It was mediocre. The best part is the chocolate fountain. MMmmm. Add some chocolate covered strawberries to your ice cream and its perfect."}
{"text":"Food was great and is what you expect from Golden Corral. The price was great, $12 for adult dinner which included the all you can eat steak. My only negatives was the steak was WAY over cooked; quite surprising for how busy it was and it was difficult to maneuver through the rest of the herd. People were acting as if this was their final meal."}
{"text":"Food is okay, although the steak was outstanding. The service at the table sucks, nearly possible to get refills on drinks. Make it easier and let us self serve"}
{"text":"Great price $16.00 for dinner, all you can eat steak as well as a very good selection of other meats and food. My server Janeisha was excellent always right there to make sure I had everything I needed."}
{"text":"You get to watch people but in line, take multiple heaping plates of the premium items....then drop it all over the floor. The food is just too salty, and has been every time we have ever gone. You get to hear the cooks open cans of food product behind the salad area for long periods of time, can after can.  The salad area is wonderful with many fresh choices. The wait help works their buts off."}
{"text":"I don't know what it is but all buffet food taste the same no matter where you are. I love Golden Corral. There is lot and lots of options for everyone in the family and the ROLLS are awesome. If you are a fan of Buffets you of course will love this place. But if you are a snoody prideful clown, don't even bother."}
{"text":"Birthday Lunch for two of my coworkers. They wanted to try this place.  Ten nurses lining up on a long a$$ line... this yelpette was not happy.  Now I know why.  Its affordable.  Its your new version of Hometown.  All good.  One of our boss who joined us said they have a Golden Corral in Arizona and for them white folks, its not all that. But overall, I think we were all satisified.  Anyway, food was fresh.  Lots to try.   I did not get to eat all that I wanted.  I am taking a better approach on foods I do eat nowadays.    Nonetheless, awesome time with my coworkers.  I will return only if there is no long lines."}
{"text":"Way too long of a line for fair food and the prices are too high for the quality. Also, watching children dip their hands into the \"Wonder Fall\" is just gross."}
{"text":"Well let me start by saying i agree with all of the reviews i have read already...but let me start with one obvious problem i have always had with buffet style restaurants...THE CARPET....UHHHHHH!!!!!! I mean if these establishment are going to have carpet in a public area with kids present and people generally eating like kids...then you must pay close attention to the CARPET!!!!. The CARPET had a horrible smell at this location...and you really have to be careful not to let it ruin your appetite.  Secondly for the $25 price tag...if your not going for some sort of special...like the all you can eat ribs....which no one else does...then it may not be worth your money. This evening...because my wife loves ribs...is why we even went to pay this establishment a visit.   Now don't get me wrong the food is very good...not great...but very good. I had a fabulous piece of rotisserie chicken breast with mashed potatoes and gravy...mac and cheese....and dinner rolls. My wife had the ribs of course.... along with various sides.  Now the dessert is not so great or very good for that matter. I had the lemon tart....brownie...and vanilla-chocolate swirl yogurt...and all of them were awful. My wife had the lemon cake and vanilla ice cream along with some fresh strawberries and she seemed to enjoy it.  Now in conclusion i don't have to go here again personally...but if a special deal comes to this establishment and you really like it you should definitely give it a shot....otherwise pay your $25 to eat somewhere else. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my friends!!!!"}
{"text":"The Good:  Steak(Huge): choose the cut you want and top it off with mushrooms or onions.  Spinach: In the Salad Bar high quality spinach.  Sauteed Shrimp: get it from the Cook, plump and juicy and seasoned just right.  Pizza: pesto pizza thin crust.  Cherry Pie  Real Ice Cream: had cookies' in cream.  You will be full at the end TRUST me.  Price is reasonable.  The Bad:  Pasta sub par, linguine stuck together.  Chinese area didn't look good.  Crab salad could use some work.  The Ugly:  Went on a Monday @ 5:30 and there still was a long line.  Crowded & chaotic would sum it up."}
{"text":"Came to Golden Corral on Dysart with the family my grandson's birthday and all. And the service was very lousy if you want your table clean pick it up yourself you want to drink go to the bathroom get yourself a glass of water you get it faster. If you want some sugar make sure its fresh . Cuz it was pretty dry and hard didn't even have fresh sugar. Talk to the management management doesn't seem to care about their servers or their restaurant. I think they need to clean house I think they need new servers and a new management that cares about their business because the food was lousy and service was definitely lousy this will be the last place on Earth that I will come back to unless they clean house and train their servers. manager's name was Vicente. Servers like to hang out where the tea and drinks are they don't serve the tables they don't clean up the tables they're too busy having a party and conversating with one another. The Golden Corral on Thomas is much much better."}
{"text":"Ok so I am not going to say the Best Buffet in Vegas but they do decent food here and have a decent variety. I particularly am fond of the Fajita Chicken, buns with Honey Butter...."}
{"text":"I don't know why everyone gives this place a bad review. This is the best bang for your Buck place for me and my family to eat (family of 7). It cost less that $60 and my family always leaves happy and satisfied. Their is a few things that is always good (steak/fried chicken/pot roast/shrimp). Then everything else is is decent. The staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"So first of all I hate the manager there.  His name is Eli, and he sucks at what he does.  Golden Corral should fire him. He's rude and always in a bad mood.  ZERO STARS"}
{"text":"Favourite place to go on a Tuesday or a Thursday Tuesday because kid free Thursday is because me and my son love the grill steaks"}
{"text":"Go around 1:30 nothing or 2 they have nothing on grill no spoon Carmel topper pump always mess up and employees talk about customer even the manager don't go here goto brook park or akron no star wood be more like it"}
{"text":"Very family friendly place. Its always clean and neat. There is one 4 miles from me but We drive 11 miles to this one."}
{"text":"The food here is actually very good. But the same problem as the last time was the weird smell.. Like a resthome.. and I looked at the carpet and it is filthy.. Probably wont be back as i cant really get past the smell even with the food being good.."}
{"text":"OMG Worst experience ever. The first thing we noticed when we walked in was that it looked like the carpet hadn't been cleaned in a while. Then after being seated it hit us, the the SMELL!!. It was so bad we couldn't even eat. The whole area where we were sitted smelled like urine. I closer look revealed that the whole place was just down right dirty.Needless to say we will never be back"}
{"text":"I took my wife here. The man who was supposed to be cutting the prime rib n other meats had an attitude from Hell. We talked to the manager n got the run around   Yes he did say he was sorry. I got the impression I was not the first to tell him.  We will not be back!   Please change your TV ads."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best buffets I've been to. The wait is long (about 50 mins) but other reviewers prepared us for that. The prime rib was better than some \"sit down\" restaurants I've been to. The fried shrimp was crisp and not greasy. All of the veggies at the salad bar were fresh. The top sirloin was over cooked for my taste but the desert choices were great. Cakes, pies, ice cream, bread pudding and even cotton candy!"}
{"text":"The greatest place on this earth.  Fo sho! I'd wait hours ....hours!!! Wayyyy better than Hometown.  I'll never go to Hometown again.  Ever. @Sean R you are crazy"}
{"text":"When we first went to Golden Corral, it was during their grand opening and everything was a very good. The food variety, selections, quality and service were extremely good. The only complaint I had was the wait time to be seated because the line was out the door.   What a difference a couple months make. Where to begin, well lets start with the outside of a restaurant where you can see homeless people sitting out front begging for change. I have never seen this at any other restaurant ever in my life until now. Next we go inside where the food variety and selections are still decent, but the quality and service have dipped a lot. The best thing this time around was the wait because there was none, but I can understand why."}
{"text":"The absolute worst buffet in the USA, or at least in Las Vegas. Those damn Jeff Foxworthy commercials made us make the trek and we should've just eaten the thirty bucks. The only reason they even deserve a star is for the yeast rolls. The food is questionable at best, the service and the patrons are horrible. I'm ashamed we even went. If you are thinking about going - DON'T."}
{"text":"Went here just to see what it was about. It's gross. Don't go. I thought the chocolate fountain was pretty cool until I saw a grubby kid just standing there sticking his finger in it over and over and over. Where his parents were, I don't know."}
{"text":"Great food. Staff is friendly and helpful. I went for dinner last nite only waited 20 mins to get in nt bad for only 2nd day open . Kudos to Jason(the owner) who I met last nite. Job well down. Come  on Las Vegas let's show our support so they open more afound the valley."}
{"text":"If you get in at the end of lunch early dinner you get the absolute best options. We love grabbing some food here. It's always calm and interesting atmosphere.  I always load up on meet first and then finish with some carbs and some fruits.  Drinks are unlimited and they have a nice wait staff to take care of all your needs.  We will be back. What that lack in sodium they make up for in options. Sprinkle a little salt and pep and your all set"}
{"text":"I've come here 4 times in the past year :O. That's 4 more times than I should have been........... but the BF and I have concluded that this place serves the best American style breakfast in the area... if you know what to pick.   Here is our routine:   1. Download onto google excel the menu/nutrition facts from their website. Highlight what foods have more than 2g of transfat and avoid (which is basically the hash brown and the entire pastry section) 2. Go early (around 10am) and there isn't a wait.  3. After you pay, run into the omlette line and immediately get one. Get lots of spinach, onions, mushroom, bell pepper and some ham. Asked for EGG WHITE. Tip the guy making the omlettes. He works hard and is really nice.  4. Get some side food: melon and cantelope.... and limited amount of bacon and breakfast casserole thing.... get some chocolate and regular milk 5. Go back to the table and eat omlette. Get back in line and get a second omlette.  6. Eat omlette.   Wipe mouth and leave. To avoid a tummy ache, avoid all other sections of the restaurant and do not, I repeat, do not fall asleep after you eat."}
{"text":"Corral is right. You get herded in and fed in an overcrowded, messy and loud feeding area, just like animals.   So sad. I went once and never again.   Take a few steps away to the BJs or Chilis for a much more enjoyable dining experience."}
{"text":"We decided to take the drive down to this restaurant on Sunday afternoon. I was very impressed.  The front entrance was a bit cluttered near the registers and the drink area. The general manager was up front assisting guests and welcoming them.   I started my meal with a delicious salad. Everything tasted real fresh.  Next I moved on to the grill. You can order as many steaks as you want. They cook them to order!  The mashed potatoes were delicious but tasted a bit cold.  I wanted ham to be cut off the bone for me but there was nobody in the front counter. The roast chicken was delicious.  Service was good too.  I was constantly given free refills and old plates were taken off my table.  The dessert bar had so many choices.   We really had a good time here and will definitely return.  We even purchased a take out box and filled it with all sorts of goodies!"}
{"text":"Visiting Mesa, AZ from Los Angeles. Was excited to visit as I had heard of it but never been.   The food was delicious.  The service was great; everyone was friendly served us coffee round the clock. Unlike other buffet places, the breakfast was delicious. There was a variety of food, desserts, fruit, salads,etc. too bad LA doesn't have a Golden Corral. I would visit regularly!"}
{"text":"The wait and lines are ridiculous...luckily the times I've been here I didn't have to wait more than 30 mins.    Did someone say, All you can eat steak?!? Mainly the reason I come here...decent selection of other food items.  Chocolate fountain and Cotton Candy..Yum!    Be prepared to wait and have people standing in a line when in reality its a buffet, not a grade school cafeteria line.  Come when you are not hungry because if you get caught in a 2 hr wait you will be fainting in the hot sun."}
{"text":"Service is fairly good and the food is okay. I, however, was not satisfied with the sanitation. Of course I understand that it is a buffet, but many plates and silverware looked somewhat unclean. Children were unattended and stuck their hands IN the chocolate fountain. This upset me, since I have always thought Golden Corral was moderately clean. Not only this, but it was pricey, too- $30 for two people."}
{"text":"We went there today for breakfast. They provide a large selection of food items so it's easy to over do it.  These are items we tried; Their Omelets were made to order with fresh ingredients and excellent (left a tip).  Found the grits to be lumpy, cold, covered with a hard skin layer and disappointing, yuk!  The sausage links were good and the bacon was done from lightly cooked and all the way to crispy.  Not very greasy either. Their blueberry muffins tasted great.  Biscuits and gravy was OK. They also had Fried chicken. It was piping hot and surprisingly good with not to much batter/breading.  Fresh fruit was meh.  The service at our table was provide by Mr. N. and was outstanding.  Prices are not too bad. This place works for both hungry and picky eaters but don't expect superior quality food items.  After all it's not the Ritz!"}
{"text":"So here goes... In my opinion, as I would like to say if I thought something was bad, it was 'AWESOME-  LY HORRIBLE!'  I wasn't impressed with the food QUALITY.  You ask for medium rare and you get well done.  One bite of the pot roast and I was over it.  The only thing I enjoyed was the corn on the cob which I was lucky enough to get one from a fresh batch.   Like any other low priced buffet, you get the basic American, Mexican & Asian selection.  I thought the dessert was going to compensate for the disappointment on the overall first Golden Corral experience in Las Vegas but I was even more so disappointed.  The carrot cake was dried.  My experience at the Golden Corral in Colorado was by better than this.  I guess for those who like the basic type of buffets that's convenient and cheep, you might just enjoy this place.    I don't think I'll ever be coming back.  For price and convenience give this place a try.  If you are looking for quality, I suggest you go else where and pay for quality food and selection. Just saying.  Happy eatings!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Golden Corrals that I have tasted in the United States. I have to admit the flavor of the food is really great. You do not have to add any seasoning. Rarely, do I find a place that cooks my steak correctly the first time and the flavor is so amazing. The variety of selections seems to cater to every taste bud. Being able to build your salad with fresh fruit, vegetables and toasted croutons, yes! At first, I thought the prices were really too high; but then the quality of flavor, variety of foods and presentation of the selections are worth every penny."}
{"text":"Not bad. Not bad at all. It's a definite upgrade from the other buffets in the area like Hometown and Souplantation. It's more roomier and has over 150+ selection of food! You can also see the hardworking chefs cook the food right in front of you. I went in during lunch time and lunch would run you about 8.50 without the beverage.   The food choices were nice. They section off the food into different areas. Chinese food on one side, seafood on the other, etc. I enjoyed their sliders alot. I also like their pork steaks as well. After only taking two trips to the buffet, I had to tap out and head over to the dessert bar. They have so many whimsical choices like the cotton candy and the chocolate fountain. I dropped a couple of strawberries into the chocolate fountain though :( If anybody finds them tell I said sorry. They even have their own mini ice cream parlor!   All in all, it's a great buffet to head out to. The line can get a bit crazy later in the day so try to head over here for lunch. I arrived at 11:30 and only waited for 15-20 minutes. My friends said they waited an hour+ during the dinner service. Yikes."}
{"text":"Since they closed their locations in Stow and Montrose, we've been coming here. Food is always great ! ! ! Service is good. We did find out that unless you like crowds don't go Saturday evenings. (G) It is packed ! But that is a sign of a good place to eat."}
{"text":"If you are hungry or don't know what you want to eat, this is the place to go!  If you have a large group- this is a great place for a large gathering!  They have a large private room. The dessert spread looks heavenly!"}
{"text":"What to say, what to say... this was a fairly average Golden Corral experience but something that I can't quite put my finger on seemed \"off\". We like Golden Corral and have been to several across the country, but for some reason this visit just didn't seem \"up\" in any way.   The food was reasonably fresh by GC standards. The service was flat, minimally attentive, and mechanical - perhaps attributing to the overall feel of the place.   The \"premium\" butterfly shrimp was definitely the best of the shrimp feature. As usual, the steak was very good but getting it at your cooking preference could be a challenge unlike at other locations. Again, a service thing."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this Golden Coral pretty regularly since they opened several years ago. I figured it was time to leave a review.   Now, I'm not a \"try it all\" sorta buffet patron. I zero in on those things I like and tend to stick with it. So, no, I haven't tried everything they have. But I have had quite a bit. The short version of this review is \"If you like buffets, then you're going to like the Gastonia Golden Corral on E. Franklin Blvd.\"   My staples are the popcorn shrimp, who's breading is heavy, but not so much that you're not exactly sure whether there was a shrimp in that bite or not. As mentioned in another review, the pot roast is really good. The fried chicken is always crispy and the seasoning is just the way I like it. The meat loaf is also very good. Let's not forget the grill, where you will get a steak cooked pretty close to the way you like it. Now, let me remind you.  You're in a buffet restaurant, not a steakhouse, so don't judge with your steakhouse glasses on. :) I like my steaks medium rare and the cook is happy to show you the cut before serving so you can choose. When I choose to get steak, I'm always happy with how it tastes. The Bourbon Chicken never fails to call me back for seconds.   As for sides, I suppose all the usuals are present. All are good with the exception of one. The collard greens are just terrible. Now, it's their recipe, not an off night or disgruntled cook. For me, collard greens need to be cooked in fatback with perhaps a pepper or two in there for some bite.  Then cooked long and low.  No where, did I make mention of sugar. The collard greens here have sugar in the recipe. I've tried them on three occasions just to see if it was a bad night in the kitchen or not.  They were as bad the second time as the first.  The third time was accidental.  They just look so good! I forgot.  But yes, they were just as bad again. But if you like sugar in your collards then Bon Apetite!  I don't spend a lot of time at the salad bar, but my wife does. She's never commented to me about how awful anything was. Everything I've ever had from there has been crisp and fresh.   So I'll say it again.  If you like buffets, then I think you'll like this one. I give it 4 stars because I am a fan of this Golden Corral. They serve fresh food that is seasoned nicely at a fair price."}
{"text":"Best food. Great  setup. Better than Hometown Buffet. They're very  fast on refilling food."}
{"text":"With so few locations in California we were happy to have to run an errand that put us in within a few miles of this Golden Corral. My friends who ate at the Nampa, Id location jumped at the chance to go with me and we had two other people.with us who had never been to one.  We went on a Sunday and only had to wait about 40 minutes.  The food was good,fresh,and plentiful. We ate until we were ready to explode.  I am looking forward to going back there next month!"}
{"text":"The only decent buffet in town when you want to eat a little more than usual. Everything seemed very fresh."}
{"text":"Used to be awesome when it was ten bucks. They raised the price to about 17 with tax per person and about 6 bucks a kid. The food quality has become terrible, the service is sub par (because the prices are high, not many tip, according to servers I talked to), the only saving grace, is their extensive salad and dessert bar. Unmatched. Ruby Tuesday has got nothin on g.c's fresh bar. I would go for lunch at $7. You can fill up for cheap if you don't care about steak or shrimps so much."}
{"text":"Came out to Vegas from California  and as a large family we thought golden corral would be awesome to go to and boy what an experience from ants all over our table while eating to having to stand up every few minutes while eating so other parties can get more food... extremely annoying did i mention the hair in my sons dressing? the servers were kind and did what they can but the manager told me there was nothing he can do about it and thanked me for being so kind  not to mention it took over 30 minutes for the manager Mr charlie to even come ... he  said he thought he took care of the ant situation but thanks for letting him know he will work on it. .. ruined appetite for me.  I only gave the 2 stars because of the servers samantha and her co worker winter  attempt to make things better they did what they could ... but charlie yuck not cool at all   ... however me nor my family which it was a party of 16 will never return to this location... by far the worst I ever had to deal with ..."}
{"text":"Just BAD. Greasy food that has been picked over and the staff is slow on cleaning the areas. Piles of dirty dishes, and trays in the middle of the seating area. I will not be back. Even if someone else is paying I would not come back. YUCK!"}
{"text":"Definitely Best buffet in Las Vegas! Huge choice for reasonable price! The service was spectacular"}
{"text":"Service was great, but place was dirty, food salty and people putting hand in chocolate fountain. Lady had dog in purse and was petting dog, then touching food. My wife and I will never return."}
{"text":"I'm really not a fan of this buffet restaurant.  Honestly the area the restaurant is located in is not that great.  I was dying to try this golden coral because I had eaten at two other golden corals in 3 different states and they were super awesome.   They were so awesome I had to pinch myself to make sure I hadn't died and gone to heaven.    This golden coral I was disappointed in.  Number one it's the type of restaurant where you have to wait for your drinks.  They were crazy busy and it took forever for refills.  I hate it when restaurants understaff.  To me the food was bland.  The only think I really like was the steak.  The salad bar was ok.  It took me several weeks to go because it always looked packed.  Eventually I decided to go with my girlfriend during the busy hours.  Big mistake!    Other customers there were like packs of animals and when the staff set out new food they would load up their plates until they had to put out a whole new batch.  To me the franchise here in Vegas has just lost some of its flavor."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled. This place blows. Never had good meal at any Golden Corral locations. Expect dry steak, bland country gravy, bland soups, poor salad, and super salty sausage and bacon.  This place is, however, great for trolling your friends who offer to buy you a birthday meal anywhere you want. I always pick this place because they hate it.  The chicken strips that they never have are the tits. But good luck finding them though.  Two stars for lolz, not quality."}
{"text":"We don't visit here often but it has gone down hill! There was not a very good selection of food and the poor selection that was there did not look nor taste appetizing at all. I will not be going back at all. Especially after what we paid for 5 people to eat there 3 of which were children. You know it's bad when there were people getting sick in the bathroom."}
{"text":"The food is not bad, every time we go there it is just chaos. Waiters take forever for drinks & picking up plates.  My favorite thing was the fried ravioli and it wasn't there last time we went.  Its always the same food not really a variety. Would go back but its not my first choice."}
{"text":"I pass by this place everyday driving down Cooper/Stapley and decided on a whim to go for dinner one night with my boyfriend. It was very crowded when we arrived but the line wasn't long (thank God) but paid almost $30 for 2. Everything was categorized by stations so we started with the salad bar, which was closest to the booth in which we were seated. Everything looked fresh and dove right in, bringing back some Clam Chowder soup as well. No complaints with the salad bar, just needed to add some salt and pepper to the soup. Next we went around to the rest of the stations, where there were options of chicken, steak, ham, pizza, taco bar and assorted sides. Food looked like it had been sitting out for a long time and there were hardly any healthy options to choose from. When I came back and started eating, everything I ate was horrible. The chicken was extremely dry, the ham that was sliced to order was not moist and had this overly sweet and hard glaze to it. My boyfriend got a steak and he said for the cut of meat it was, which wasn't good, was cooked well and at least edible. We also tried the popcorn \"shrimp\" when we realized it wasn't actual shrimp. The taco \"meat\" was truly a mystery as well. Nothing had flavor and everything was so dry. Gross.  As for sides, the mashed potatoes were awful and the mac and cheese was mediocre at best. I didn't touch the pizza, as it looked nasty. My boyfriend and I did not finish our plates and debated just grabbing dessert and leaving. We walked to the dessert bar, where the options were a plenty but not too appetizing. The chocolate fountain with strawberries was the best thing I ate. The apple cobbler and peach cobbler were giant blobs of canned fruit disasters. We were still hungry so we went to grab more salad but when we walked back to the salad bar, everything was taken away and being cleaned with bleach. I wondered why they were bleach cleaning during the middle of rush hour dinner service...the smell permeated the entire area, which made wanting to eat even more unappealing. So, we scratched that idea.    Golden Corral, we tried to like you but you just make it very tough with your step below \"cafeteria\" style food. It was also very dirty inside and décor is very outdated, which makes the place seem even more dirty. Our server was also annoyingly loud and was singing to every song being played on the radio. Really, people don't want to hear your squealing during dinner. I couldn't wait to leave."}
{"text":"I have been to this location several times and the food is very good for what it is! Most of the food is surprisingly fresh and flavorful. The salad bar is sufficient as well. The great thing is the selection of food offerings. Some of the things that I find consistently good are the Yankee pot roast, ham, grilled chicken and fried chicken. The vegetables are usually quite good too. The turnup greens were vibrant and very tasty, however, they didn't have any apple cider or pepper vinegar to go along with them - bummer! Like I said - overall pretty good for what it is."}
{"text":"Good for a full course dinner!  Especially when there is shrimp and steak.  Not good for lunch, where selection isn't really that great..  You know where there's a lot of food but nothing to really eat?  Like opening your fridge, seeing all the food, but shutting it anyway.  That's what lunch felt like.  Also, I definitely don't think it's worth waiting in line.    Recommended for: No lines + dinner [without high expectations] + lots and lots of hungry guys/girls + affordable price."}
{"text":"American food variety in unlimited quantities, as a child I recall relatives going to an American buffet after church every so often. I recall the curiosity as a kid. Some buffets seem to have lost their touch, this one, reminds me of the buffets I ate at as a child.  I came during the lunch hour, which, judging past reviews seems like the best time to come here. My wait was 10 minutes or so, the food was fresh and hot, as good as it can be for its style and genre, since it is not Wolfgang Puck.  I saw most or all of the foods depicted on their website.  Highlights: --Cotton candy machine --ice cream cone area --Chocolate Fondue machine --Areas labeled as Italy and Asia, a huge fruit and veggie salad bar. --I enjoyed the chicken skin on the fried chicken, pork chops and brownies  Silly me, I did not see the fries, I also was too full to try the chocolate strawberries and the Mexican food.  Place looked clean, service was efficient and no issues today.  This is modern Americana in unlimited portions, nothing fancy, no foie grass, valet service, plate presentation or all of that. For what this is, a modern American buffet, I rate this pretty high. If I come back in the evening and the wait or quality is lower, my rating will go lower too.  I like to eat American, so I will be back.   Rick Derringer 1985 song \"Real American\" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIVf7eTqmpE  I like to eat American, pie for the plate of every one I like to eat American, give me a slice, give me some fries!  When it has greasy fat and it goes with fries After a juicy steak, give me apple pie If you heard my friends, they say super-size They want chicken wings, give me juicy thighs  I like to eat American, pie for the plate of every one I like to eat American, give me a slice, give me some fries!  Flavor is strong so I write this song Line is feet long but not a furlong Buffets ring a bell inside of me Hunger is what keeps, all of us yelping  I like to eat American, pie for the plate of every one I like to eat American, give me a slice, give me some fries!

{"text":"My husband and I visited last week around an hour and half prior to closing.  Mind you I did not know it was somewhat close to their closing time.  The food was mostly old and not fresh (outside of the salad).  I understand what time it was, but if they are going to be welcoming new guests, they should ensure the food is up to standard, especially when paying $12 per person.  It was very slow but the server only checked on us once to bring my husband a refill but left the plates on the table.  After about 15 minutes, I called her over to ask for a refill (cup sate empty for a while) and that is when she took the plates.w  I called the next day and spoke to a shift manager to discuss these concerns. No apology or acknowledgement of the situation just an immediate question of why I did not bring it up when I was there.  We were tired, irritated and just wanted to leave.  She had an excuse for each thing I brought up and never apologized. After several excuses I realized she was not interested in my concerns. I told her it was a bad experience and this was brought up to help avoid it.  She did offer to provide one free meal (out of the two paid meals).  I told her it was not fair for me to get my meal free and my husband to have to pay when he was subject to the same situation.  She said she would do half off for each but she was not willing to replace both meals.  After no proper resolution I told her I understood her unwillingness to make things right and that we would not be visiting this restaurant again. I will just leave my review in hopes of preventing someone from having this type of interaction."}
{"text":"I should've known better.  Went on a Sunday around 4pm.  Thought it wouldn't be bad since it was after lunch and before dinner.  I was wrong.  $13.99 was way too much.  Food was picked over or they were out of a lot of items.  They had a picture of scallop skewers with big, juicy scallops.  Actual scallops were miniscule, probably a quarter of the size of the picture.  Isn't that false advertising?  Anyway, I asked my daughter to remind me not to go to GC on the weekends; only Monday through Thursday, maybe Friday for lunch only.  Dessert staff was kind of rude."}
{"text":"Gross buffet. I give it two stars for the price and the service. The food was so disgusting. I was barely half a plate in and felt like I wanted to vomit. The only good thing was the icecream. But come on now really ? Ice cream ?!?"}
{"text":"I was surprised at how busy this restaurant was. My family and I had to wait in line for a while until we could check out and be seated at a table. The cashier and waitress were very nice, and the waitress repeatedly brought us drink refills and cleared our dirty plates, but I saw other waitresses blocking the traffic of customers by standing around complaining and swearing about other employees. The price per person for the all-you-can-eat buffet was inexpensive, only about $11 each. I liked the fried chicken, green beans, fruit, etc.--basically the foods that are very easy to prepare, but some other foods did not taste good. For example, the meatloaf was very bland. My husband said that he hated all of his food and was hungry after leaving the restaurant. Aside from the mediocre food, another problem with this restaurant is the customers. Some of them looked dirty, one woman let out a phlegmy cough near my plate of food without covering her mouth, etc. The restaurant is so crowded that the customers swarm around and you cannot escape them. I will not return."}
{"text":"Our waitress is Brooklyn. We ask for her when we eat her because she edify's our dining experience. The food is good and its nice to have such great customer service! Thanks Brooklyn"}
{"text":"So, finally they opened a Golden Corral in our area.  For the longest time those commercials actually made me want to visit one again.  In Texas they have Golden Corral everywhere its no biggie.  However, people here seem to think its a really good place to check out.    My advice is don't go unless you have 2 1/2 hours to waste.  On top of that its so annoying because 4739827432798 kids are running around unattended, making all kinds of noise.  The food wasn't even that great, I only went there thinking that they might have something different offered.  After finding out this location is like every other Golden Corral, I was very disappointed.   The steaks were very hard to eat, after trying to insert my fork to begin cutting a piece.  The fork bent and felt like putting a fork in a piece of rubber.  The difficulties made my experience even worse, especially because 5 kids kept bumping into my chair and yelling in my ear.  I actually had to tell the parents to control their kids.  I don't care how inexpensive it is or how many people said it was delicious.  Because in that area there are plenty of nice restaurants with no wait time, and will fill you up the same way for $30 which I paid there.  The pasta was disgusting, the sauces were not even right.  There were a couple things they did well, everything that was a fried food and all the chicken.    I would stay away from this place if your not trying to eat salty or greasy.  Because a lot of the dishes are heavily seasoned and very greasy.  The worst was the Spanish rice it was too salty to even digest.  Hopefully they improve their quality of the dishes, it shouldn't matter that a lot of people line up to eat there, and the restaurant is super busy.  The food & service should always be good regardless of how many people show up.  Food \"D+\" Service \"C-\""}
{"text":"Much larger selection than the one we usually go to in Casa Grande. Our server was very pleasant and kept our plates cleared and our drinks filled. Will be back."}
{"text":"This is a buffet restaurant and should be held to the standards of a buffet not of a traditional sit down restaurant like the those nearby.   The staff does as much as they can it seems with the herd of people who line up and wait minutes and nearly hours just to walk in to the restaurant. Yes, this place is loud and can be messy but the atmosphere of the restaurant is due to the customers. Customers who are loud, who are uncivilized & whom allow children to roam free like loose cattle. Can give low stars on this account  As for the food it's better than the average buffet locations around. Remember this buffet food which is made in front of you for the most part unlike other places. Can't expect 5 star dining from a buffet restaurant.  Overall if you want to just hang out and possible wait a while to enjoy better than average buffet food come to this location. Expect the noise and rowdy crowd and expect to walk in to a buffet line."}
{"text":"Wow really good selections for a buffet. They have sweet potato fries, popcorn shrimp, sautéed mushrooms, mini steak burgers. They have cotton candy, ice cream, a chocolate fountain. Children 3 and under are free. I'll definitely be back I enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"Where do I start? I'm giving this place 3 stars only because the food is good and there is a variety of dishes to choose from otherwise a max of 2 stars. I really like the ambience of the Golden Corral in Kingman, Az. But being that I live in Vegas/ Henderson and this is the only one out here I decided to come give it a try. Big mistake. Omg! When we first arrived they told us to seat ourselves. Mind you, we, as a group of 10. So we found an area in the back to fit maybe 6. I told one of the hostess that we needed another table to fit our group. His  response was \"well I just got here so you'd have to find one yourself and pull it to the your table\" ABSOLUTELY NOT!!! I DONT WORK HERE!!! I wish I could have gotten his name but his back was to us the whole time I never caught a glimpse of his name tag . He was an awful hostess/server whatever you want to call them. He never came to our table to check on us. Maybe he thought we weren't going to TIP HIM. I know how some small minded ppl think. Wrong!! I live here, I work here and I TIP here sir!! He kept going all around our table to the next tables. Finally we called another young man who happened to be passing by us to see if he could assist my family with our needs. I.e water, hot sauce, more juice etc. His name was Damarlo. I remembered his name because it was noticeably in my face plus he was so nice and so helpful. From that point on he was at our service. He did explain that he was out of his area by assisting us but he would be more than happy to help. He didn't want to step on anybody toes. There is NO TOES to be stepped on because nobody is helping us!!! It's all about customer service. We have elderly and children with us who needed attending to. Isn't that what our other hostess/server  job was to do? I didn't see where we could get the drinks and other things we needed from for ourselves.  Back to attention at hand. The place is dirty as far as the floors and they half clean the tables once a group leave. Our table(s) were filthy. You know, the tables we had to seat ourselves at. I guess they wanted us to wipe them down ourselves too which was not happening.  Tons of kids running around all over the place. You can barely walk to get your food without tripping over someone's kid. There's NO STRUCTURE what so ever!  And to add insult to injury they have the nerve to have girls making balloons for the kids as if the place isn't crowded enough. I can't lie, being that they were there I had to have balloons made for my kids too. It was only fair. That was totally by default. So at my already overcrowded area/table I have a balloon girl making animal balloons for my kids plus another 15 kids (from a whole other area of the place) pulling  and tugging on her to make them a balloon. Talk about HECTIC!!  After our supposed to be server/hostess noticed that someone else was helping us with our drinks and other needs, he had the nerves to come ask us if we needed anything! Nope! You did a great job at ignoring us.  I was so glad to leave this place I didn't know what to do. I definitely won't be going back, well wait.....Maybe if they build one in Henderson I'll give it another try. But until then... they won't get my business."}
{"text":"1.  They are better than Hometown Buffet 2.  Unlimited \"cooked to order\" steaks and fish/shrimp 3.  Long lines 4.  Around $10 lunch/dinner prices w/o drink  It's definitely not a vegas quality buffet but it's pretty good.  Teeters between a 3 star because their steaks bring me here but 3 times of out the 4 times I been there the guy cooking the steaks always gives me well-done steak even though I ask for Medium rare.  It's their draw and drawback.  People go crazy over their chocolate fountain and cotton candy but I don't touch both of those things.  I'm just there for the steak and seafood.  No point going to hometown buffet now.  This place just trumps the shit out of hometown buffet.  Oh, you also can't get your own drink refills.  You'll have to ask your waiter for it."}
{"text":"The line was out the door, but it only took about 30 min.  The fried chicken line, seems like there was always a wait, also the steak line.  So the steak was ok, and the chicken was ok, cat fish was ok.   They don't season there food!  I love salads, and the salad bar was really good.  So for the price, for me to get a little meat, and a lot of salad was worth it.   I guess they charge extra for drinks maybe about $4.00.  Service was good for the kind of place it is.  I could care less if I go back or not."}
{"text":"Golden Corral is a decent buffet. The prices are good. They are not overpriced and there weekly specials are very helpful for large families. There fried Catfish is fantastic and there salad bar is excellent. They also have a fresh grill where they grill a specialty food daily. There desert bar is awesome and they even offer a chocolate fountain. Thumbs up."}
{"text":"This location opened up about a year ago and I've never gotten the chance to try it because the line is always ridiculously long.   The idea came up and tested my luck and what did you know? The lunch line was bearable (Time : 1:10PM, Thursday!)   The layout is pretty much like any buffet. You like up, grab your drink and pay first before being seated.   While you're waiting to be seated, the feeling of excitement and anticipation on what to attack first when given the chance. My vision ignored the \"greens aka salad bar\" and went straight to the grilled steak and onions, dessert section and fried foods.   There's a good selection for all and I prefer GC vs HT Buffet any given day. The food is a lot fresher and appealing to the eye and stomach."}
{"text":"A really good buffet outside of a casino. 11.99 for dinner was a very fair price. The salad bar and toppings were fresh and they had everything from fresh baby spinach, grilled steak, chicken, diced ham and bacon.  To boiled eggs, several types of crutons. The entrees were a hit or miss.. The post roast was really good as was the baked chicken, ham and grilled fish. The chinese food was just okay..The fried chicken was tasty as long as you removed the greasy very salty skin. The clam chowder was nothing impressive, kind of on the bland side. The desserts were really good as well. Typical selection of pie slices as well as chocolate cake and carrot. The \"soft serve ice cream\"...was very liquidy and kind of gritty.. but you can't go wrong with the chocolate fountain. ."}
{"text":"Words can not express how bland, how dirty, and ghetto this place is.  The health department should be here regularly.  Service is sub par, the food over cooked, salty, or just not good.  I jave been to others and its not even close. Never go to this location ever."}
{"text":"Ok please listen when I tell you this is worst service worst food and worst environment to be in  I say Jail with no bars Food very cold bland not to many choices as they say you have to serve yourself everything oh the plates are children plates meaning small colorful plates like when you where a kid Fork knives and spoons where dirty this place is really horrid for the price I will never come back or recommended anyone please be advised"}
{"text":"Food was old. Chocolate fountain dried up and not working. Employees not washing their hands. The black guy that is always on the grill is only concerned is flirting with women and ignoring others. The cashier didn't believe my father was a senior even after viewing his ID. When this place first opened it was amazing, now it's just another ghetto buffet."}
{"text":"Okay so when you first walk into the restaurant and the manager says to his cashier, hey you're gonna be short $35 in your drawer but don't worry, I can fix it later... Tell me that this place has it's morals in the right spot right? I went on a Monday around 1:30 and it actually was pretty packed.  The waitstaff was friendly and refilled my drinks multiple times. For $8.99 for the lunch buffet I guess my expectations were pretty low. I got the mac and cheese and fried chicken which made me a happy camper. As for the rest of the food... well I have no idea why they even bothered.  The salad bar was missing several items. They never restocked the burgers even though there were plenty ready on the grille. The roast beef was kind of gross and the one dish... bourbon chicken... I couldn't even tell what kind of meat it was. The steamed vegetables actually looked sick and the pot of cheese looked kind of gross. The chocolate waterfall was pretty cool. The peach cobler, not so much.  I mean its a cheap buffet, I wasn't expecting the world, and I've been to a couple golden corrals before but this was quite run down. Kind of sad but hey they're still in business so they must be doing something right?"}
{"text":"went there an hour before closing and mostly everything looked bad or it was out. Define telly your $12 can buy you better meal, but not at 10pm. The usual crowd of families, etc"}
{"text":"This place is bad.  I went here today with a friend.  The wait wasn't too long.  But, the steak tasted salty and overcooked.  The silverware was cheap.  I bent one of the forks when eating a steak.  The place isn't tidy.  The floor has like napkins and food.  The calm chowder and bussel sprouts were too salty.  The desserts were too sugary.  I will not come here again."}
{"text":"You know, it's unfortunate because I really did like this place.  I used to go there at least once a month.  The food is surprisingly good for a buffet (especially the steak...I was shocked by how good it was).  They even have cold steak in the salad bar, which was fantastic.  Unfortunately, I got food poisoning from them in November 2012 and haven't been back since.  I've never, ever been so sick in my life.  I've thought about going back and giving them another chance, but I can't risk missing any time at work (again) because of their food making me sick."}
{"text":"No stars should be given I had to give a star just to post  absolutely horrible.....even the ice cream was terrible....how do you mess up ice cream.....the one good thing was the cotton candy but they were stingy with that only filling the bag up a little....we will never go back"}
{"text":"This was my second time eating here.  Nothing really stood out.  Only one item (the slider) did I deem not worth finishing.  Even with 3 plates I did not make it to the salad bar, but I did manage to get a piece of cake.  There were plenty of dishes to choose from so I picked what looked good to me.  Some of the upholstery is coming apart.  The bus person/drink server in my area was pleasant.  True to form the screaming 2 yo sat right behind me.  The age of patrons ran the full gamut with most of them being my age and older."}
{"text":"Went with Rand and Robyn for Thanksgiving brunch. Typical of Golden Corral I consider it a 3.5 rounded down because that is how I roll.  They do a pretty good job of putting out a lot of mostly decent food. This time the pot roast was a bit dry.  Several of the food labels were left over from breakfast. If you want to get filled up on a budget with mostly American food this is a good choice. Even at capacity the staff was still cheerful and we got drink refills and dishes cleared in a reasonable time frame."}
{"text":"This buffet is an experience!! First you drive past about 40 day workers in the home depot parking lot adjacent to this location to then park and stand in a line of people that goes out the entrance doors. As you get close to doors.The signage states that All guests must wait in line. Which apparently only applies if you speak English. Then when about 10 people possibly the day workers from home depot meet up with the groups in front of you and you state you need to go to the back of the line and wait,as stated in the sign next to their face they reply with Que? As you finally stop arguing with the day workers and packs of their kids whom neither can articulate any form of response you walk in an see the elderly not being accommodated accordingly and the hombres and kids entering thru the exit doors so they don't have to wait in line. You get to the registers where you see families claiming the ages of children. Policy was great for 2 little kids per paying adults. You finally get waved to a seat as groups of ten plus wait and clog the  entrance ways. As u walk up to the plate areas you notice a lot of children unsupervised touching everything resulting in in sanitary conditions. Plates should be placed higher. If you go directly to healthy options there's no wait and its clean.The dessert areas are  packed with people and kids touching you and picking food up with their bare hands. I observed people (grown adults)picking up food with their bare hands and putting food back from off their plates!!Thats Nasty. As you then see people taking videos on their phones of the buffet line.Also The bathrooms were dirty. The food is decent its cheap and this location really needs to be enforcing food safety from customers by having signage displayed in both English and Spanish.This location is attempting to survive the chaos.It is a bizarre location and I have been to better golden corrals."}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying I am not a buffet type of person, I like to go to a restaurant, be seated at a table and be waited on, I'm old school like that, there are times though that I do venture into a buffet, if in Vegas, it's the thing to do, and if I let the kids pick the place we are eating at, they are buffet lovin fools!!  So with that said I took the kids (let me remind you, they really are not kids anymore ages 20, 19, 17 & 15) and my grandson (yea I'm a grandma, but he is the coolest!) out to the Golden Corral, it was a Thursday night about 6:30pm, and there was a crowd, my 17yr old looked at me and said hey everyone and their grandma came to this place to eat, and laughed, hardy har har   Went through the line made it up to the soda man, we were a party of 5 but only 4 of us got drinks, grandson was free, but somehow they still changed me for 5 drinks, just watch out guys if everyone in your party isn't drinking cuz you might get charged for it.  Here is my other grip, why is the cost of a buffet so dang much, for the 5 of us it was 72 bucks, man I could have taken them to a local place and eaten good on less than that. But again it was the kids pick and that doesn't happen much.  I just like more bang for my buck.  The food, well let's just it was ok, it's not the best, but I have had worst, I wasn't impressed with the steak , grainy and chewy, but OMG those rolls, geez man they are soo good and add that whipped honey on top of it, sweet heaven right there!  Well the outing for the kids was good and that's really all that matters.  Can't promise though if I will be back"}
{"text":"Asked for a Rare steak twice.Both times it was Medium to Medium/Well.Expecting an Italian flavor I was shocked that the marinara sauce had corn in it and tasted like watery salsa! I will never go to their dinner buffet ever again. Excellent fried fish and a wide,tasty variety of just about everything.Real ice cream too.Not your typical soft-serve."}
{"text":"This used to be one of our best place's to get dinner. Our son is a growing teenager and it takes quite a bit to fill this child up! We started noticing things a few years ago on a weekend, they were putting things away way far  before closing. You still had hours to go so why put things away? Their meatloaf was a crapshoot as for flavor. Sometimes all you tasted was kestup other times it crumbled on your plate. One thing my husband and I hoped for was a nice piece of steak and sides like salads. I had stepped to the little window, luckily no one coming my way, and asked for a beautiful, med-rare piece of prime rib. Someone came around and asked and took it before I could say rude! Other problems were parents letting their young kids about 4-5yrs old run around the place, grab things to eat by bare hands to eat, dip their fingers in the chocolate fountain only to lick their fingers and do it again. Iv seen adults do questionable as well. Most at the salad bar; put blue cheese on their salad, only to put it in the ranch container. They will grab individual fruit to sniff; (If they didn't like it, back in the container). One that killed me was a woman who grabbed a chair and sat at the end of the salad bar and she had no plate but was eating handfuls of raw fruits and vegetables.  Too creepy!!"}
{"text":"First few moments of walking in and Jolene (the manager) made a lasting impression, NOT IN A GOOD WAY.  My family and I have never been to Golden Corral, we decided tonight was the night. We walked through the doors and was greeted by a young lady asking for our drinks which was different from other places we have been. Following, a woman asked if there would be three of us eating. I answered yes and payed. As I put my change away a server came up to the woman taking care of us, the server asked if she could close her section? The manager(Jolene) as I was gathering proceeds in a rude tone, \"well is your section clean\" the server answered \"no\" the manager rude again \" then go clean it up\". I told her we had never been here and wondered how it all worked, she explain to the left is desserts and middle is main dishes following the salad bar on the right.  The three of us walked away to find somewhere to sit. My sister and mother asked me if I thought she was bitchy, I answered YES, I thought I was the only on thinking this. I told me sister I was shocked she was so terrible to her staff in front of guests. As servers walked around my sister along with mom asked \" is that your manager? And is she always rude?\" They all answered the same YES. They were not surprised to hear she talked unkindly to fellow servers in front of guests, she did this regularly. My sister and I are servers and thought this was uncalled for, we mentioned to her at the end of our visit that we disagreed with the way she spoke to her server, thought any employee should be talked to with respect. She apologized like she had never heard this. As we left a server said she was thankful we said something because this is very common her being rude."}
{"text":"I am only giving 3 stars because their breakfast is the best! Lunch & dinner is slacking..not as gr8 as it use to be! Rolls were hard like rock.."}
{"text":"So after years of seeing the ads and passing the one in Hesperia numerous times, Mom and I ventured in..  Line was inside not that long at all, got our drinks and paid. Started with a salad, then moved onto dinner, then the best part, the chocolate fountain and other various desserts. Our server was nice and kept up with the refils and used dishes. The food itself was good, service was great. I'll be back but it'll be a once in a while type place.."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with a good 'ol corral style buffet. The people watching is the most interesting on the weekends so make sure to get a good spot in a back corner so you can make the most of your experience. Our waitress was so friendly and helpful and considering the environment, that's saying a lot. Good prices for breakfast and a good place to feed lots of people dinner for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"So, I have recently been introduced to the Golden Corral, and I am pleased to make its acquaintance! I think what I like about Golden Corral the most is the kind of food I get to pick from. Forget American Chinese, American Mexican, American Japanese, and the like...give me some good ol' AMERICA food. There's nothin' fake or missing from their wide arrange of options and dishes. And everything is tasty and appealing to me, which isn't always the case in other buffets I've tried. The rolls are amazing and the desserts are tasty.   The only complaint I have is that they don't bring you bread any more...I know, it's a petty complaint, but I'm just sorry I had to lose the ONE service they provided that I really don't want to do for myself...oh wait, they get your refills too."}
{"text":"I visit this Golden Coral every Saturday as part of the Marine Corps League.  The food is always hot, fresh and tasty. Our servers Kelly and Roz are very attentive and always polite.  The gentleman who prepares the omelets Tony also does a superb job. This is by far one of the best and cleanest Golden Corals.  I plan on being there again this coming Saturday. So if you are a former Marine or a veteran from any service please feel free to join us or just say hello. Kelly and Roz will always make room for another.  Semper Paratus"}
{"text":"One of the worst Golden Corrals I've been to. The one in Akron most definitely excels this one. Many empty dishes on the bar. And what was on the bar was pretty much undesirable. Dried out and looked like it was left over from the day before.  How hard is it to do this job? I mean most of the food is already precooked! And still can't seem to get a stocked bar.  The manager she stayed in the office most of the time. She did come out but not to overlook the employees or the food. She talked with one other person and went and hid.  This place SUCKS!"}
{"text":"A cancer free celebration dinner!  Awesome possum this buffet was. So many options to choose from and for my fellow dinner guests, steak for dinner! Following the suggestions from Randy, I stopped by this place and boy was I glad that I did. I always though buffets were forever lame, but now I see the buffet light at the end of the tunnel.   Plenty of vegetarian options like meatless mexican options, lo mein, spring rolls, macaroni and cheese, salad bar etc. I did not leave hungry. They have a chocolate fountain so that means chocolate covered strawberries!! Yes! or chocolate covered macaroons! mmmm  The service is always great but the bathroom was a bit dirty the last time I went. After I complained they did give me a nice phone call so I say great customer service. 4 stars~"}
{"text":"My mother has been in the hospital all week and she loves the bread pudding from here. I stopped to get her some carry out and politely asked the manager if he would give me a discount and explained the situation to him and he gave it to me half price.  I could not appreciate that any more .....the finances are mounting with things we need to purchase for her comfort and safety and the discount was a blessing....Thanks a ton !!!"}
{"text":"Food was cold and took a long time for drink refills. Is also not as clean as it should be"}
{"text":"Changed to coke- don't like coke- prefer Pepsi, food was better than last time i ate there good fish tacos"}
{"text":"My husband, son and I ate at the location on Northern Ave. on Veteran's Day in the evening. Golden Corral is excellent in that they provide Veteran's a free meal every Veteran's Day and this year, they included the drink. The line moved fairly quickly as we were waiting outside. The people in line were nice and friendly. The ROTC students from the high school nearby were there to help out. The staff inside worked hard to move everyone through the line and to the registers.  The Veterans were given a sticker that read: \"I served.\" The family and friends that accompanied their loved one were give a patriotic sticker. We were seated with other Veterans at a table. The lines moved pretty well throughout the buffet stations that had a large choice of foods to choose: comfort food, Asian, breakfast, salads, soups, Italian, Mexican and desserts. Our waiter made sure he cleared the plates and  our drinks filled. He worked very hard.  Our experience there was great. It was one of the best visits. We didn't go the past two years and they have vastly improved since the last time we were there on Veteran's Day. We will return to this location. On a side note the restrooms were clean and well stocked and the restaurant despite being extremely busy, was kept clean, the food was fresh and hot and everything was delicious. Even \"Uncle Sam\" was there and my son had his picture taken with him :)"}
{"text":"Was in the area and met up with some family.....Good thing I didn't go here with the intentions of eating....but at least hoping it would be average.   Eating here depends on what you consider food.....Personally I don't care for institutional/cafeteria type food.  I was just going to go sit with everyone to chat....but wasn't allowed in unless I paid for a meal......$11, I didn't want to argue.   I did have water and one of the dinner rolls.....oh, and a piece of cake.  Which was still a bit frozen.....but at least it hadn't been sitting out there too long.  The salad bar looked like some kid decided to play in it......most of the \"hot\" dishes were not.  Some of the people in our party remarked on how cold the items were.   I knew going in that the food wasn't going to be good.....BUT they could have at least had a clean place!  You can tell they use the same mop each time they 'clean' the floor.....the entire place had that sour smell to it.    Here's the thing.......you go here to eat quantity........not quality.  Period."}
{"text":"Not bad, could use more variety on Chinese food, but overall great selection and taste, worth the cost."}
{"text":"For the price, the food quality isn't bad at all. Actually the food here is pretty decent. But it's always too crowded and an hour wainting in line is a must, so I would only come back once in a while. Also there's too many kids running around all the time, I don't even remember what I eat by the time I get out of here. So crazy always and crowded. But they do have some good steak, fried chicken, man and cheese, and chillis. Also I love the cheese buttered biskets."}
{"text":"Sometimes I like comfort food.  And sometimes I want a lot of it.  This place satisfies those desires and does so cheaply and with friendly service.  Win.  Win."}
{"text":"Cheap buffet.. comparable to Home Town buffet. Super crowded, long wait, slow service from our waitress whom walk by us slowly several times avoiding all her tables. Good desserts ;-)  Baked sweet potatoes & plain salad greens were my favorite clean eats. For this price, sure I might be back upon request only.... not by my own choice."}
{"text":"Came in at dinner time on a Saturday.  Had to wait a while for a table.   While the tables were packed, the same could not be said for the buffet.   Most dishes were empty.   People were grabbing whatever they could just to have something to eat.    The meat station was featuring barbecue ribs.   However, there were none available.    The bathrooms were over crowded.  Way too small for the size of the restaurant.   And they were very dirty.    The odor in the restroom was enough to eliminate the appetite I had from the lack of food.  I  Our waitress worked very hard.  I believe she was serving an entire half of the place, so it was hard to get service.   Everybody working here seemed to be doing their best, but the place just isn't equipped for the number of tables they have.  They need more  staff and larger restrooms.  Will not be returning to eat here again."}
{"text":"This place is much better then I expected. Its pretty much better then Hometown Buffet in every way. You can see the cooks preparing the food. The food looks good. The food tastes good. The only thing I dont like is that you cannot get your own drinks. Due to how busy this place always is, I have issues having my drink filled.  There is a Hometown Buffet about a block away from this place and they are in trouble. The only reason to ever go to Hometown is if you have coupons or the line at Golden Corral is just too long and you are willing to settle for inferior food."}
{"text":"I went to lunch around 3pm with no line. Awesome right? Anyways the food was ok. Decent. Better than hometown imo but my gripe is the staff. My server sucks. Never once did she ask if I wanted a refill on my drink and my plates were stacked 4 high...  I had to complain to the floor manager Anthony. He apologized but still the lack of professionalism had caused me to have an awful experience. Don't know if I would go back.  If I do it would ve because of the floor manager"}
{"text":"2/13/2018  I revisited Golden Corral during their \"Early Bird Special\" where seniors get a discount between 2pm and 4pm.  I was presently surprised how clean and updated the restaurant looks.  A server named LaShun was very professional, courteous, friendly, and refilled my drink and removed my dirty dishes in a timely manner.  She made me feel that she wanted to make my experience a positive one.  There is a large selection of food to choose from and everything I tried was good and I especially liked the large selection at the salad bar.  If you have not tried Golden Corral recently, I would recommend you giving them another visit."}
{"text":"this place made me sad. it IS cheap, and there is plenty of food to fill you up, but id rather go to souplantation. it was too depressing for me to sit there with all the aggressively hungry people who were pushing and milling about in lines to get meat. it was just way too busy and hectic for me. i didnt want to stand in line. it was really sad for me watching all the fat people shoving food into their mouths.   pros: - chocolate fountain: the only highlight of this meal was the chocolate fountain. but, please be prepared to be cut off in line by small children and pushy asian ladies.  - plenty of fat clogging, artery tightening food. heavy on the bread and fried stuff.  - price, it is cheap  cons: - pushy people! - nothing was tasty, but nothing was horribly gross either - such a mess! hard to find a table that wasnt full. it was just a loud crazy place. a very hectic experience - frozen food: thought id try to be a lil healthier and headed over to the very very empty salad section (surprise!), only to find frozen peas and frozen corn.   would i come again? NO thank you."}
{"text":"Here in vegas this is pointless. You can go to any buffet in town and get way better food and service. It's so chaotic. Most of the food taste old. The carpets are dirty and this place is new. I hate to see what this place looks like after a year."}
{"text":"I went to this location for the first time and needless to say I will never be back! The food was disgusting and cold, and the service was unbelievably horrific! I waited 10 minutes for a refill and when the waitress came to our table, she took off my straw and lid herself, touching MY straw, put the dirty plates down on our table, and put my cup in her apron pouch where food was all crusted on. I couldn't believe what I saw. I was completely disgusted. That is no where near sanitary! I know it's just \"golden corral\" but please get your service staff in check!"}
{"text":"The 3 times I have visited this place it is always a \"HUGE\"line which is not always a \"BAD\" thing, the food is pretty yuy for the $$. It's funny I think some of the bad reviews I have read of this place is probably the employees of the nearby Hometown buffett\""}
{"text":"It's been years since I've eaten at a GC, so I was surprised to see this location have only a 2.5 Star overall rating.   While I'm sure that the service can be a hit or miss, I found our server to be very attentive and the food rates 4 and 5 Stars with no problem (I did go for the Early Bird Buffet).  I started out with a Spinach and Greens salad,with Mushrooms, Cheese, Ham and Blue Cheese Dressing. The greens were in perfect condition, and the cheese and ham was fresh. And, the Blue Cheese Dressing! OMG, now I'm not a fan of BC Dressing, but this dressing was fantastic!  Then, it was on to some Mexican Rice, a Tamale, Pinto Beans and a piece of Sweet Corn Bread. Again, everything tasted great!  Then, I had some Mashed Potatoes, Gravy, Sauteed Mushrooms, Smoked Pulled Pork and Pot Roast. The potatoes were creamy, without being runny, and the gravy was seasoned perfectly. The pork was tender and had a noticeable smokey taste. But, the mushrooms and Pot Roast! Another, OMG here! The potatoes and vegetables were tender, without being overcooked and the roast melted in your mouth.   Then, it was time for desert. :) I had some Bread Pudding, Apple Crisp, Banana Pudding, a small piece of Chocolate Cake, a Brownie, and a freshly dipped Chocolate Strawberry (how freshly dipped? I dipped it myself in the Chocolate Fountain (a real surprise to see this in a buffet, as I've only seen it once before in a very nice restaurant years ago). Other than the Apple Crisp (use to be be my favorite desert. But, this time, there was not as much filling as I remember, and it was a bit too caramelized for me to really enjoy it), all the desserts were delicious. And, I was extremely surprised at how good the chocolate was in everything. WOW!  Well worth the money, and this place is back on my list of regular stops when I'm dining out."}
{"text":"Pretty good food quick to seat us and everything was fresh!!!!! Would come back again on a holiday not a bad place to eat .."}
{"text":"Come before 6pm... It gets mad crazy after 6pm  I was surprised about this place.  I normally don't go to these cheap AYCE buffets (e.g., Hometown Buffet) but I heard good things about this place.  The line wasn't too bad before 6pm but after 6pm the place just got backed up and people were eating like the end of the world was gonna happen, Mayan-style!  The steaks here are very good for this level of AYCE.  The chef cooked mine about medium rare and it was a good medium rare.  It was so good, I came back for seconds.  The bread... omg... the bread rolls here are made fresh (I think all the bread are) and the honey butter is to die for!  The butter on the fresh bread is amazing.  I also tried the fried fish and fried chicken and its made Southern-style and it was pretty good.  It makes Hometown Buffet's like frozen food.  Overall, there is a freshness and quality that exceeds Hometown Buffet by light years.  It is as good as any AYCE buffet I've had at some hotel in Vegas.  The only problem I had here is that drinks have to be served by your waitress.  The problem with that is its so busy here and the poor waiting staff is just swamped.  It looks like they don't staff enough waitresses to get you your drink refills so it does take about 10 mins before they can get you your refills.  This place gets overwhelmingly crowded on a weekend dinner so expect to wait awhile to get in if you come at that time.  Other than that, my family and I loved it and are going back again tonight to get our grub on!"}
{"text":"I like it here the variety is unbelievable. There's something for everyone. The bad thing about it they allow to much people in at one time. When it's too crowded I lose my appetite. I see too much people going into one dish at a time, or its so crowded that when you're in line it feels like the person behind you is riding your back. I also don't like that if you want a drink you got to make it yourself and carry it in to your table. Especially when it's crowded you have to play obstacle with the people."}
{"text":"Came to Golden Corral on a Sunday evening with my family. We didn't have high expectations for it. Once seated we went for our first plate. I was disgusted when I grabbed my plate to see that there was still food on it from the previous person. I was surprised to the fact the food was better than I expected. Our busser was on point and took our plates quick. Unfortunately this will be our last time at this Golden Corral until they solve their issues."}
{"text":"This place has a good variety of food for a cheap price ( dinner)! The food was decent. Not bad . Love that but eariler I saw a pitcher of water that the waitress (Annie)  was suppose to use to refil water. It was sitting on the window frame.. I thought that was pretty unsanitary since the blinds and the windows could be dusty and dirty. So I'm a sense , the refilled water is sitting here collecting dust."}
{"text":"Place was packed to the gills last night. Even so, the staff made quick work seating us, and getting us started. The wait staff was on the ball with clearing plates and keeping drinks refilled. Really good service. The guy on the grill was on the top of his game. Every one of my steaks were cooked perfectly. Was really happy with everything overall and left a good tip for my server. Will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"They have really made a lot of improvements. More carving stations, better steak, better overall choices and taste."}
{"text":"Salty. Better then home town. Busy. Lots of ppl. One of the better buffets. I wouldn't go for dinner though. Very busy.  Cheers, -Herbal Tea"}
{"text":"It's cheap, it's hoosier (ghetto) and it's what u expect. If you're worried about people touching the serving spoon after not washing their hands when they use the bathroom, use a napkin like me to hold it. The food is ok but I warn u...stay away from the chocolate fountain. Little booger hands are always in it and no one is watching over it."}
{"text":"Why  why why did I go here? What was I thinking?. I wasn't drunk, I wasn't kidnapped, I wasn't  even forced at gunpoint and nobody sent me on a dare. what the hell is wrong with me?  Ever not eat at a golden corral for 4 years,  see a commercial and go, forgetting how bad it is? It's like the Walmart of resturants.   They make sure to keep all the obnoxious fluorescent lights on so you can see the hospital beige walls and tired booths. This is the only place in the world that can take basic food and turn it into a grosser version of itself. Not 1 thing beside the yeast rolls is good. Not.1 thing. Mashed potatoes? Can't even mash a real potato . Do yourself a favor and scald your tongue before eating here, maybe then you wont be as offended as I am I don't know,  maybe you like your meals from the microwave, then this might be the place for you. And weed, smelling like the doobie puffin mcstuffin smoked before he got behind you in line.  This is where good food goes to die."}
{"text":"I really like this place. Best are their chicken wings!!! SO GOOD SO JUICY SO GOOD!! The thought of coming here gives me a surge of the happy chemicals to my brain. I love soul food! So much good food here!! No complaints from me :)"}
{"text":"Let the picture tell the story. Seriously I thought they quit making alpo. Some of the rudest wait persons ever"}
{"text":"I'm bumping it up a star because my daughter LOVES this place :) There's something about eating until your ready to pop that puts a little twinkle in her eyes, lol!  As far as buffets goes, this is definitely one of the better chains. Clean, good variety & always packed."}
{"text":"I heard from people, the food at Golden Corral was so delicious. So I had to try it...BLAH! The only decent food with flavor was the yeast roll!!! This place was so filthy, I didn't want to try any food. Floors were disgusting.  Plain and simple, DO NOT EAT HERE!"}
{"text":"Great food when it opened, now gone down hill. 3 people almost $60.00 and food quality is very poor now, Never will I go Back."}
{"text":"Gordon Ramsay would not be pleased. Just look past the food bar, into the actual kitchen and you could tell it's a complete mess. With that being said, if they can't take care of their kitchen and take pride in it, what makes you think they will take pride in how they make the food. Who knows what goes on in the kitchen. I would recommend only if you're looking for a subpar food."}
{"text":"LOL Its a buffet. Soup, salad I got was good and the fountain chocolate/caramel was fun.   BUT - me and my nephew almost had to beat up some guy who got attitude with my dad. 80yr old bumps you on accident and apoligizes, why you have to get mad?! lol But the peace keeper wouldn't point the guy out and claimed he left.  Than my nephew almost got into it with the fu-fu guy who refilled our drinks. Dude was sitting in the back but staring at him. LOL guy was fu-fu, my 18yr old nephew is handsome...so....!!!   Friend and nephew enjoyed their med-rare steak. My dad really enjoyed the skillet cornbread.  Again it's a buffet so nothing stood out. We were having to much fun teasing each other and I only paid attention to what they made comments about.   My nephew was embaressed to go ask for his steak first go round. But my friend walked up there second round and he was bummed becuase he already got his second plate - a slice of pizza. He WOULD NOT waste food. He knew already he would be full after the pizza so he was hemming and hawing that he was fine. But he finally passed it over when I said I'd eat it...well.. I wasted it. LOL"}
{"text":"I rarely come here, but I really need some protein, and knew this would be the place I could get a variety.  I arrived at 3 PM thinking it wouldn't be too busy and everyone on their game. The Parkin lot was packed and no handicap parking available.  I started with the salad section, which had both romaine and iceberg that looked fresh. Several good items available, but I was not impressed with the dirty counters, that almost an hour later are still the same way. The lettuce was also all big pieces that you will have to wrestle to put in your mouth.  I went onto the warm veggies and it was very l, very clear which were the fresher ones and the older ones thrown on top. There is a definite difference between a brown brussel sprout and a nice bright green one. Brown collard greens and fresh ones. I choose some sort of chicken.  During the time I was eating my meal, a male employee kept complaining often when he came back to refill drinks for customers. Sounded like he had lots of issues to talk about, yet customers should have to hear it.  Seems like change in shift, and that could be why there is chaos.  Voice boomed over loud speaker that pm employees meet in some room. Then a male employee complained how long the meeting seemed to be.  The ice tea I ordered is cloudy and really a waste, should have just had water.  My waitress Bree, did well in checking in with me and clearing away my plate and checking on me often.   She is a definite bright spot to this meal, and I hope the powers that be, notice.   I hope the dessert does not let me down.   The caramel with soft serve ice cream and Oreos was awesome.   So Bree and desert saved the day!  Wait! Bree cleaned the salad bar! Way to go. See, she made the visit!"}
{"text":"ALL-YOU-CAN eat steak?!?!?! Low Price?? What is wrong with this place??? How do you expect to stay in business when people like me will grub up off their grill?! And it is tasty too?? NOICE!  EUREKA, I have found my steak haven!! Since I have moved to quiet town, Rowland Heights, Calif, my fear of not being able to find restaurants similar to the ones that I visit on a weekend basis has been resolved. Scared as baby lion Simba, I ROARED my way into getting the first dish that I can find to build my mountain high of STEAK! Sorry, hakuna matata has got to wait.. The magic password in getting \"THE\" huge piece is, To Server over the counter: \"Sir/Ma'am, may I get a whole piece of steak please? Oh, and in medium rare.\"  NOICE# 2!  Aside from the steak, their food there tasted fresh and good. Not too dry on the meat loaf or too chewy of the lasagna. Their desert area has a fudge fountain and a cotton candy maker!! However, sorry adults, no chocolate covered cotton candy, boo!! Their fruits are fresh and are not floating on old fruit juice from reused platters.   Their servers are always prompting me on if everything is alright and if I need anything. Almost feels as if there is something wrong with me but in a good way, haha! So, thee only reason why this place is missing a star from perfection is because during our first visit, we got looped into the line that wrapped around the building and their food was a bit salty. For future conclusions, more spacing, easy on the salt, and we're good!  Bring your kids, not just me, and they will also enjoy this place. Although this place does not serve alcohol, it is for your own good.. extra belly room for a full meal!"}
{"text":"By far, the worst buffet I've had. I don't even want to be reminded of it. There was a wait of about 45mins for an odd hr lunch at 2:30pm, by the time you get in, it's about 3:30 ish. After the long wait outside in the sun, you still have to wait inside to get your food! It was so crowded inside and the food was not even good. Sorry to say that Hometown buffet is even better than this.   They have basically the same type of food but this place has a ice cream station, grill station with steak and shrimp and fish (dinner only), cotton candy, and chocolate fountain. I can't believe that i didn't like anything there. The grilled pork chop and steak had no flavor besides the taste of charcoal, it doesn't even taste like it's been seasoned with salt. I got my piece medium, it was pink inside but the whole piece was still dry..why??   The best was probably the cook to order shrimp and fish at the pasta station for dinner. The pasta was soggy and wet, yuck. The shrimp and fish were ok, but come on, it's just sauteed with butter and cayenne. They only give you a very small portion at once. So if you want more, you have to wait few mins, and if there is a line, then good luck.   Dessert, there is an ice cream and cotton candy line. Good luck on waiting b/c they scoop it for you. The line never dies down and they will scoop out the tiniest scoop of ice cream you'll ever see, so if you want more, go wait another 15 mins in line. But i say don't bother b/c it's not even good, as well as the chocolate fountain. Maybe my taste buds were already messed up after all the food i tried, so nothing was good afterall.   For that price, i would pick Souplantation or Hometown over this anytime to prevent starvation and anger. And if you really want to see what the hype is all about, go in between lunch and dinner hrs so you can try both menus."}
{"text":"There aren't a lot of buffets that I will go to anymore, but for some reason I keep coming back to Golden Corral.  They have steak grilled to order, which is awesome. And they usually have a few varieties of shrimp, most of which is de-veined and very very good. Also their yeast rolls are outstanding.  I wish there were more locations (particularly closer to me) because this place is always packed--which makes perils of its own from a cleanliness viewpoint. Invariably I will see some person doing some thing that will make me avoid a particular food item for the rest of that night. (No. Seriously. If you are the kind of person who will stick something into a chocolate fountain, take a bite from it, and then put it BACK into the chocolate fountain again--kill yourself.) There are signs everywhere that say clearly that nobody under 10 is to be unaccompanied by an adult but there are children running around everywhere anyway (perhaps if the notices were bilingual. Or maybe the staff could try a little gentle reinforcement. Just a thought.)  The staff does their best to keep things clean though, I very rarely see them slacking off. The restrooms aren't ever in terrible condition, there is hand sanitizer provided in multiple locations... Really I can't find any reason to say this is a place you should never go. The food is consistently good, and the dessert selection is very nice. If you can deal with the inevitable 10-20% of the current patronage at any given time being devoid of tact and class then hey go for it. It's closer than a Vegas buffet.."}
{"text":"Have come to this location on several occasions. Food never seems to be hot, and the fish is usually undercooked. The manager checked the temperature in some of the dishes, and they were not at the temp they should be at. We asked for a milk, and the one they gave us expired a month ago. Not a good Golden Coral location."}
{"text":"Visited Golden Corral today, 7/1/15. They are a great buffet, as far as price goes. Food is OK. Good salad bar! Good for families. But please, Golden Corral!!!! Stop overcooking those poor Vegetables!!!!!  We've visited many times, and the overcooked vegetables is my pet peeve! I must give kudos to our waitress, Tracy! She's truly an asset to this restaurant. Nothing better than a waitress that is so attentive to our needs. #satisfiedcustomer Hope Golden Corral appreciates you!!! William, the cashier was so pleasant! :)"}
{"text":"If I could leave less than 1 star I would! I was having a vertigo episode, so my husband got my plate for me. The guy running the steak area was so rude to my husband and belittled him I front of everyone about only getting one steak. He tried to explain that it was for his wife but he wouldn't listen and kept yelling at him. My husband finally walked away and gave up. We got water and because of that no server would refill our drinks which is fine we got up to refill our own which they also yelled at us for. Worst service ever!!! I normally love golden coral but this place sucks."}
{"text":"I was not impressed or disatisfied with this place after wanting to eat here for a longtime.. The food was mediocre and the ambiance of rude patrons made it uncomfortable. The server was very attentive though and very sweet."}
{"text":"And I didn't have to cook. I was impressed. Having owned a restaurant in the past, I know how hard it is to do it right.  Nice job to all. This will happen again."}
{"text":"The food is good.  Don't care for the setup.  There are ed other buffets.  This one acts like fast food."}
{"text":"As good as buffets can get.  we always get right in and don't have to wait in line for  cashier, food, or drinks.  Eve when crowded, they do a great job of keeping food stocked and I don't remember having to wait in any of our 4 trips here.  Prices are about $30-35  for 2 with tip. Clean and good service."}
{"text":"You one were to envision a love child created between the crowd on a New York City subway platform during prime time rush hour on a Friday evening and a Texas steak house... Golden Corral would be it.  Prepare to fight through lines. Lines to get in, lines for food, lines for the bathroom. But once you have mastered the technique of weaving through an endless sea of people with your hands precariously balancing plates full of tasty morsels, you're, well.. Golden (forgive the pun!)  The food is usually amazing, the atmosphere usually smells both of well seasoned steak and vomit on any given night, which can be kind of unnerving and titillating all at the same time. If you can stomach the scent of someone's \"Roman Dinner\", then you can most definitely complete the evening with ease.  Service is hit or miss, be prepared to slowly nurse your drinks or go for quite a long while without.  But the food and the dessert bar and the PRICE! ($11 for food and drink and $2.99 for kids!) makes it all worth while.  Wear your stretchy pants or a long shirt to hide that popped top button of your jeans!"}
{"text":"I am being kind when I say\" This place sucks\" As soon as you walk in, you realize your mistake. The rug is filthy, and the place looks dirty throughout. So I give it a chance anyway. After checking in we head for our table which is hard to find one without dirty dishes on it. The ones that have been supposedly cleaned haven't been wiped off. Once we find one we take our pops and set them down and put a napkin from the filthy holder over our drinks (so that no pest can get to them)  and we head for the food \" using the term lightly \" every one in there is there for the fried chicken,  but there are only a few dried pieces in the tray. How you let  anything run out is a mystery to me. So I walk around to see what else is there, trays are empty, what is left looks dry. Ohh yeah. The dishes are dirty with food on them. It looks like they just ran water on them and brought them back out. I end up eating a couple pieces of sausage and a little corn and that is all. You don't see the server until they see that you are preparing to leave, I guess so that they can collect a tip. My GF always wants to come here but I hate it so I don't tip but she always does. Some people are easily impressed, I guess that's how I got her haha. But anyway, don't waste your money on this place it is not worth it and should be closed down. Depending on how many people are with you, you would do better to put your money together and cook out.I give it one star only because I don't see a place for zero stars."}
{"text":"The first time I came here, I was in a weird mood- all I was interested in eating were vegetables (very weird for me).  So I went through the buffet and grabbed all the vegetables they offered- cooked and raw (not a huge salad bar but decent assortment and has some unusual items), and I was amazed- all of their vegetables were actually good.  What are the chances that all of the vegetables on a buffet line would actually taste good?!?     After that on later visits, I've tried their other foods.  Their pot roast is really good.  I have enjoyed their different special items (on 1/23 they offered peach waffles).  I love their sweet potato casserole.      A couple of years ago, my brother brought me here for a birthday lunch with my sister and her 2 boys.  My family is now hooked on their chocolate fountain (marshmallows, strawberries, cookies, rice krispies- all sorts of things to dip), their mini-ice cream parlor (usually 4 choices), and a COTTON CANDY machine! I brought my nephew here on 1/23 for his birthday- great venue :)"}
{"text":"As clean as you expect a cheaper buffet to be, though maybe a bit more expensive due to the selection.  They were doing their best to unclog pieces of fish from the chocolate fondue fountain (ok it wasn't fish, but something) the last time I was there but having had it before I wasn't sad to not get any (it tastes fairly horrible).  They have a pretty solid selection and the food is pretty good.  I give it slightly more than a meh but not quite yum."}
{"text":"This place was good when it started grand opening. I came back again today. I notice  everything seem kind of dirty. The dishes was sticky and grimey. Everything seem kind of out of place. I notice the food quality was pretty bad this time due to the way the cooked the food. when I 'd ask for medium rare I keep getting well done. I do thing I would be coming back here again. w"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I will not be back nothing wrong with the food, but the service was horrible, I waited for someone to refill my coffee till I had to get up and get my own coffee.."}
{"text":"Food wasn't that great and they had a hard time keeping the food stocked. The buns were the best thing they had and we got six of them to bring home.   Even the chocolate fountain was disappointing."}
{"text":"OMG!!!  HOW DISGUSTING!   The first bite of my salad and I pull a long blond hair out of my mouth, I'm not blond so its certainly not mine.  I wanted to barf.  Never again,  poor quality and lousy management. If your going to go to a buffet go to a real one,  this is Vegas and they are every where. It got 1star only because no stars wasn't an option."}
{"text":"Clean, delicious fresh food, and very attentive staff. We have been here a few times and it is always good. The staff keep fresh food coming out. Truly a quality buffet."}
{"text":"It's kind of like the Burger King/McDonalds of buffets. I know buffet food is inferior menu food, but if you have the munchies and love potatoes. You can have them in every which way. This place has a huge variety. Sometimes the food is good, sometimes it's not. The only thing bad about this place is the majority of the other guests, otherwise known as pigs to me. You have to consider the source, Elyria. Go when kids should be in school or early hours if you can."}
{"text":"Come here every once in a blue moon to overfill my belly... I can always find a few good items, plus they seem to have made to order steaks on every visit. Last time I went for lunch they were making cheeseburger sliders and they were really good : )"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely horrendous. The meat scared me by its inauthenticity so I ended up only eating vegetables. You couldn't even buy me dinner to make me eat her again."}
{"text":"Jasmine was the best waitress ice ever had the food wasn't bad either  will come back forr sure"}
{"text":"A-OK with me.   Sure, its like the Wal-Mart of restaurants, but the food is decent enough and there's plenty of it.    It's not my favorite.   I wouldn't go to this place on a first date;  I wouldn't go here on a business meeting; It's pretty rough on a Sunday after church lets out.... Al I know is  My daughter likes the variety that's good enough for me.     It's got it's place.    I'm down."}
{"text":"had to check this place out after seeing the longass lines so we waited about 2 hours and didn't see how it was any different from hometown buffet... except they offer steak?  food was mediocre- probably all made from various boxed, canned and packaged processed food place is littered with little children everywhere--floors are dirty- bathrooms are dirty - just not my kind of place  definitely won't be returning"}
{"text":"The lines around dinner and lunch time are always colossal, almost equally so to some of the people standing in them.  I was impressed by the variety of food available here when I managed to finally get in. I guess my choosiness allowed me to luck out and grab the best parts of the meatloaf and pot roast. However, even considering this, the foods seem to contain very high levels of salt. I had four glasses of water by the time I was done with my meal.  The service isn't bad for such a prodigiously crowded eatery but I won't be coming back until I hear about their food improving.  But, hey, at least it's cheap. It's dirt cheap compared to many restaurants in the area, although you can't expect too much."}
{"text":"This place has a larger variety than Hometown Buffet but Hometown is easier to navigate since it has sections whereas Golden Corral is just one big row in the back.  The staff is very friendly but forgive them if they forget things since its hella hectic.    They share a parking lot with BJ's so parking can be frustrating, another plus for Hometown.  Golden Corral is pretty much a better Hometown but you cant go wrong with either one for mediocrity."}
{"text":"So my first review was deleted several years ago for what was deemed an offensive racial comment pertaining to the clientele at GC.  I find it odd that people often confuse inappropriate comments with truthful comments.  Anyway, I ate at GC last week for the first time in two years.    I must say I was really surprised how they have come up.  First thing I noticed is that they now place silverware with an abundance of napkins on your table.  This is a major step up from the antiquated way at which you had to wrestle people for the last fork, only to find it was still coated in mashed potatoes.  Well, what you thought was mashed potatoes.  This is a major step forward in quality control.    I went early, so the people watching was at an all time low.  Nobody smelled, yelled or shit their pants at their table.  So, that was a major disappointment.    I was there for Prime Rib and Shrimp.  I can honestly say all selections were very good.  The Prime Rib was excellent, breaded shrimp and veggies all done very well.  I don't know how they prepare their cauliflower, but it's always done perfectly.    However, in typical GC fashion there was no cocktail sauce to be found, no serving utensils in some of the chaffing dishes and still stacks of plates with caked on food items which you needed to choose from.    And to add another shock, the carpet was clean.  I'm not sure I have ever been here when the carpet didn't look like a restaurant-wide food fight just occurred.    My server was o.k.  I all needed the entire time was one refill, and she was spot on.  I did notice that the cashier kept herself busy wiping off the food service area and sweeping, which is nice to see.     Even the servers behind the counter were rather pleasant.    This place turns over Managers like Liberty Avenue turns over Johns.  But if they can keep this current guy, I may just return once a month."}
{"text":"Our family decided to go to the Golden Corral for thanksgiving dinner.  I could not have cooked dinner any better.  The entire family thought the same.  Turkey, mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes, green bean casserole, corn.  Great gravy.  Other patrons were saying three same while I was waiting in line.  No mess, no fuss at home.  The only thing we found as bad is no left overs for turkey sandwiches.   Will repeat next year for sure."}
{"text":"Decent variety of food! This place has something for everyone. We went here for dinner and they had pasta, sliders, fried chicken, pizza, soup, seafood, steak, tacos, and even breakfast items.  They also had a salad bar, which had an ample variety of items that were fresh. On top of all that, they had a dessert bar with such goodies as ice cream, pudding, fudge, cake, cookies, and pie. The employees were polite and the restaurant was clean."}
{"text":"The food was fresh and tasty loved the steak made to order. The line was really long but it went fast. I didn't do the chocolate fountains I'm not a big sweets fan. I would for sure go back. You can't beat the price and the staff was really nice."}
{"text":"Startin' off the year with a BANG BANG Elite Gold badge!  Golden Corral in Las Vegas has been months in the making.  Previous to this one now, the closest one is in Hesperia, CA (which I have eaten at and reviewed).  Silly me for taking my family to this new establishment on grand opening weekend!  Damn.  The line was LONG.  Like all-you-can-eat crab legs long.  We were standing outside for a good 30 minutes before we even reached the door.  Then it was another 15 minute wait through that line to get to the cashier.  By the time the family and I got to the front we were starving!    I do realize coming on an opening weekend has its ups and downs.  Boy were there a lot of downs this day.  The place seemed to be beyond capacity, all tables were full of families dining.  With this, tables seemed to be pushed even closer together to accommodate more folks.  Our next table neighbor was literally no more than a foot or two from our table.  Talk about close quarters!  But we managed to make due.  Lines for the entire buffet were crowded.  Bad, but food was being replenished at a furious pace.  Good, because freshness helps.  After getting your silverware and favorite color plate (go ahead - blue, green, red, yellow) help yourself to endless amounts of food.  It's not much different than your average buffet in Las Vegas, and the quality and quantity ends up being right in the middle of the pack.  Think - better than your local Chinese buffet, but not up to par like Wynn or Bacchanal.    There are three main sections in Golden Corral:  -On the left is the salad bar  -On the right is the dessert bar -In the middle is your main dining  I'll give them credit, their salad bar is pretty big for a buffet.  I found all the makings to make a decent Chicken Caesar Salad as well a Cobb Salad.  They even have bleu cheese crumbles!    The main event at Golden Corral is good.  They have a good variation of food on their dining line.  You have foods that go the spectrum:  -American -Italian -Mexican -Asian  With American you get your fried chicken, macaroni & cheese, catfish, and grill items like steak and cheeseburger sliders.  Yes, sliders!  This is my main reason for coming to Golden Corral.  Those damn sliders.  They are made of ground steak so the quality is actually very good.  I could eat a plate of these and a salad and be a happy man.  Line up for them though, they usually go very quick!  That day the tray was constantly being replaced, and halfway through our meal they ran out.  Good thing I stocked up and grabbed one for each family member!  And an extra two or three for myself...hee hee.  The catfish was also pretty good, fried fresh so they were crispy and not too oily.  I also enjoyed the fried chicken, as long as they were either leg or thigh pieces.  The breasts are a bit on the dry side.  The other food areas were just OK.  I didn't carb out with the pasta or pizza from the Italian station, and the items in the Mexican station were a bit bland.  Really, Golden Corral, you need to improve your Asian station!  Just like the one in Hesperia, not all Asian food has bean sprouts!  Ugh.  But at least your sesame chicken dish was decent.  The dessert area seems to be the biggest attraction for a lot of folks, especially kids.  Come on, cotton candy?  Are you serious?  The only other buffet here that might decide to offer it one day would be the Wynn (the buffet of fancy desserts).  So yes, everyone and their Mama had a cotton candy at some point of their meal.  Another big thing at Golden Corral is their highly advertised chocolate fountain.  In fact they have three:  milk chocolate, white chocolate, and caramel.  Great, have your kids dip candy in more candy...can you say DIABETES??  Oi.  I do keep it simple on dessert there, I like a scoop of ice cream (yes they have Breyer's or Dreyer's) and their banana pudding.  So easy but oh so good.  Who knew?    Prices at Golden Corral hover around other buffets in our area, $8 range for lunch and $11 range for dinner.  We went on a weekend and hit some kind of all day dinner period so we paid the dinner price.  It was nearly worth it, but the crowds really detracted from the experience.  Hence, the 3-star rating.  I will be back, but probably not for a while until the lines die out a little bit.  But good show Golden Corral!  Welcome to the buffet capital of the west!"}
{"text":"The line was pretty long, we waited about 45 mins. The food was pretty decent. It's almost like Home Town Buffet. The place was pretty crowded, and a lot of people. The price was pretty cheap.....But, I don't know if I'll ever go back again. Because of the long line...."}
{"text":"Food was either too salty or too sweet, no longer fresh mashed potatoes they were sandy like texture, fruit was old and bland.  And the price keeps going up not worth the time or drive."}
{"text":"Went to this place again.  Big change and not for the better.  People coughing on their hands and then handling serving utensils.  Kids playing in the chocolate fountain. They were under 10 yrs old and no parent control.  Place was dirty and dishes and cups are old and stained.  They use plastic plates and cups and they need to be replaced with real dishes.  People taking something and then putting it back after they handled it.  One lady was standing there eating right out of the buffet and her kids were dipping their fingers in the chocolate fountain and licking them.  Saw too many things that were wrong.  The food was cold.  One lady took a ladel of soup and it dripped down her arm back into the soup tureen.  Very dangerous.  Will never return to this place again."}
{"text":"This was our first time coming here and we were pretty excited about it. Always see the commercials and wanted to try it out.  Was a major let down.  There was a crowd out the door which was fine, took us about 30 minutes to get seated. No Problem. Waiter was very nice(which is I gave a bonus star).  The food however was a complete letdown. It was cafeteria quality at best. The salad bar was decent but I would warn people away from the shrimp topping.   Sadly quality control is pretty substandard. We noticed some funny tastes and when we inquired about it we were told that all fried food shared the same fryers & oil...really added a gross fishy taste to everything that was fried.   I guess the biggest draw here is the steak seeing as when we left the line was wrapped all the way to the desert bar. Funny thing is, the steak wasn't that great. Guess people just enjoy the variety of food and being able to pig out as they please regardless of taste."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service, Kenny waited on us. Very polite and a great sense of humor on the job. Kids enjoyed lunch and it does make a difference when the waiter is kind and has a smile on his face. Thanks again Kenny for an outstanding job!!!"}
{"text":"I came with low expectations, so that I wouldn't be disappointed.  Yes, the wait in line to get in is usually at least 30 minutes.  Yes, the meats are cheap and tough,  Yes, the pastas and pizzas are disgusting.  However...  The price is cheap for a buffet, especially if you only drink water.  The fruit/salad station was pretty fresh.  I loved the way the chocolate from the chocolate fountain hardens on your strawberries/marshmallows.  The breads are incredible when they are not sitting long on the shelf.  I am not a bread person, but I can't help eating at least 2-3 loaves of bread at the Golden Corral."}
{"text":"If you're into steak, this is the buffet for you!  All you can eat steaks off the grill for $10 Mon-Thurs after 4pm, you can't beat that.  The zig-zag lines to get into the buffet will remind you of those long lines waiting for rides at the amusement park.  Place is very crowded, hard to maneuver around with plates of food.  There is also a line to get to the food, once seated.  The staff are nice, friendly and refill your drinks.  Has a good variety of foods, and a chocolate fountain/cotton candy section.  I personally made the mistake of indulging in the salads and pastas that I only had one steak.  :(  Tips: Make sure to come with a hungry HUNGRY stomach Prepare to wait in long lines after 4:30ish Mon-Thurs and on Weekends Hit up that grilled section! Small variety of fruits/Asian dishes Prepare for the large crowds and try to avoid running into others"}
{"text":"Extremely cheap and if your looking for taste....lol you won't find it here  Line is extremely long and after waiting in line for 45 minutes, this family cut in front of us.The dad used his kids to cut in line first! WTF! I wasn't going to make a scene because I didn't want to beat his ass in front of his kids...but then their aunts, uncles, and grand parents starting cutting in one by one...before i knew it, 2 little kids turned into a family of 9! IT WAS ON!!!!!!!!!   This experience isn't really the restaurant's fault as they do have many signs posted about no cutting...but still...this is the population you will deal with when coming here."}
{"text":"I love coming here!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The best place. Only 1 in town but still the best place to come family and friends. Kids always eat when we come here its always a bit busy so to not have to the severs worry about us we but the LARGE drinks. And hardly ever nerd a full of whatever were having to drink. 5"}
{"text":"We arrived about 6:30 pm for my sister's birthday dinner. It wasn't as busy for Saturday, with the help of the rain. Other than the sirloin steak, everything was the same. Guess it was chicken night: chicken wings, fried chicken, roasted chicken, bbq chicken. And of course the ever wonderful side dishes:  corn, mashed potatoes, gravy, Brussel sprouts, spinach and smoked ham (which were Sandy, they should have washed the spinach several times). Salad bar with the normal sides and the desserts with ratchet kids poking the chocolate fountain.   So I asked the gentlemen working the grill for a medium rare steak. No surprise there, he pokes and prods, but to my dismay when I get to the table and slice into the low grade steak, again a perfect medium well. I know this place is in the east side of town and it shows in customer service and the integrity of how they make the food. I didn't even want to touch the plated desserts knowing the fact these ratchet ass kids stick their dirty ass fingers in the chocolate, who knows if they sucked on the pineapple and tossed it back in the bowl, cause quite honestly, that's what it looked like. I just decided to stick with butter pecan ice cream, I mean who wouldn't, it's enclosed so the person who works the dessert station has total control of serving!  Other than the fact it was raining outside,  and an older gentleman knocked out into a seizure, dinner with the family was okay. Our server, a bit on the slower side on picking up dirty plates and refilling drinks, understandable that there were 8 adults, 2 teens, a child, and an infant. And a couple other tables to service. But half the time, our server wasn't even seen. Knowing the fact this is Vegas, with the large selection of better buffets to go to, it wasn't my choice to come to this ratchet restaurant, for that price of $15 and some change per person, I'd stuck to the strip, Main Street Station isn't bad on Saturdays. At least there, drinks aren't a separate price and they have sea food on the menu. Again, I wasn't in charge, it wasn't my birthday."}
{"text":"There is always a line running all the way out the door for dinner time.  Sometimes you can wait for an hour or less but sometimes it's more.  However, I don't think it's worth waiting over an hour for.  Food is okay but nothing really stands out that would make me come back again.  Service is minimal, and the only good thing I can really say about this place is pretty much the price."}
{"text":"Once i saw the construction of this restaurant, I asked my friends and heard mixed reviews from family and friends. I finally found the time to go with my dad for dinner and there was still a line outside the door! aha. So i figured it must have been worth the hype.  After about 20 to 30 minutes of waiting we finally paid and received our seat. So far it was decently clean, especially for how busy it was. Our waittress was very nice and kept coming back to check up on us to see if everything was alright. Good service from her.  I always get mac n' cheese from any buffet and it was ok, I liked how i can faintly taste the cheese. as other places it's just like a watered down cheese. The chicken was nearly tasteless to me. Greasy too. But since i got the fresh batch, it was hot and juicy. The steak was good, nonetheless. Everything else I didn't find anything to say other than it's average. Nothing good nothing bad, for a buffet.  I like some of the staff, as they are fast and friendly and aren't afraid to smile. I've been to many buffets here in Vegas, and theyre fast but not too friendly.  Is Golden Corral worth it's price? I would say yes. it's inexpensive, the food is average, customer service on my visit was great. Come visit once the lines die down, or if youre on this side of town."}
{"text":"Finally was able to find a location around after watching all these Golden Corral commercials.  The price is pretty cheap for the amount of food you get.  It isn't the best, I mean we are not in Vegas here.  But not bad, and a good enough variety.  Came during lunch but wish we came around 330pm so that we could be around for the dinner menu. In my opinion it is better than Home Town Buffet.  Luckily I came when there was no line but place was still pretty pack.  My niece especially love the cotton candy, in her mind it is the best buffet around just because it has that.  Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"First off, Ignore the low ratings by some of these \"buffet haters\"  These people just don't like buffets and if you're one of them, please don't go. Why do you guys even waist your time posting reviews from buffets you so clearly don't care for?       That said to all of us that love buffets, this is the best buffet second to \"Rio\" in Vegas.( That one is the \"Holy Grail\" )  Golden Corral offers Great steaks and a whole slew of different stye chicken wings.  tasty pizza and it goes on and on.  Just come, that's all I need to say.!!     Cons.  Restaurant  should be bigger IMO."}
{"text":"I am a proud Golden Corral aficionado and I don't care who knows it. I grew up in the South so I'm partial to Southern style cooking, and Golden Corral is THE place in town that can get me my fix when I'm craving old fashioned pot roast, fried chicken, boiled cabbage and green beans. They prepare and season their veggies in the true Southern style and they are pretty darn close to the ones my grandmama used to make for Sunday supper. That's why this place brings back warm memories for me and that's why I love it.   I've dined at Golden Corrals all over the country, and the one here in Vegas is one of the good ones. The food is always tasty, fresh, and the restaurant is clean (especially for a lower end buffet). As long as you don't come here with unrealistic expectations about fancy food and five star service, you won't be disappointed. Are you going to get James Beard Award quality steak? Food Network worthy desserts? No, of COURSE not! But you ARE going to get down home country cookin' that will warm your belly.   It can get crowded at peak mealtimes but the line tends to move quickly. Prices are higher on the weekends and at dinner time (when they bring out the \"fancy\" offerings like steak and fried shrimp) and they do have a senior discount for old timers. They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner, all buffet style. Unlike casino buffets in town, drinks cost extra but you get free refills."}
{"text":"Absolutely Thee best golden corral i have been to!! Everything was seasoned great!! Everything was fresh the broccoli and cheese i absolutely couldn't get enough of...not to mention my steak..cooked to perfection!! Definitly made this Cali girl wanting more!!"}
{"text":"Some good food!  Everything hot and most items fresh.  Aunt B's chicken is best.  Salad bad was great.  Had dozens of items.  Service was good"}
{"text":"Food is well decent but the service is TERRIBLE it is not that hard to be courteous to customers. It is not okay to ignore people and give so much attitude. My family and I understand how the restaurant business works and were by no means rude or even needy but after being bumped into by a server (by the name of Destiny in an uncrowded area)  I don't think we will be back to this location and I hope for the business they get it together."}
{"text":"My husband wanted to go here after attending the Pittsburgh ComiCon.  We don't have them up in New York, and he likes to try different buffets.  We'd actually been here once before and it was incredibly busy, but I acquiesced because it was my husband's choice.  Anyways. It was still incredibly busy, but the service this time was much speedier.  Our waitress was super-polite, made sure our drinks were NEVER empty, and she never let dirty plates sit too long.  The food for dinner really wasn't that great.   I love to have big salads, but I felt like the choices were limited.  (Though the lettuce was decent.)  The main courses were mostly overdone.  My husband saw a little kid dipping his hand into a container of pineapple.  The Rolls were dry.    Only thing that redeemed this review from getting 1 star - the chocolate fountain!"}
{"text":"Would like to say went to this location 2 first time was ok 2 one was awesome . we had the best server thomas. Good job Thomas !"}
{"text":"I will start off by saying that the food was much better than I was expecting. If this review was only about the food I would give the Golden Corral 5 stars. But alas, there were problems that have prevented that from happening.  This was the first visit for all of us. We were a party of 5, and arrived early because people told us the line was long and we should plan on waiting a while before being seated. We walked in the door with a big sticker that said \"We're glad you're here\" and there was not a single person ahead of us. Walking up to the register I would have expected a greeting along the lines of \"Welcome to Golden Corral\". Instead the cashier snapped \"You have to get your drinks first\".   I understand that some buffets do not include the drinks, and I am OK with this. But I do not appreciate being misled. I also don't find this to be a friendly greeting. We paid and stood by a sign that said \"Please wait to be seated\". After waiting for some time the rude cashier finally told us we could take any seat we wanted. (Note to other diners: Signs here don't mean that much)  On the way to find I table I couldn't help look over the food, and was happy to see hand scooped chocolate chip mint ice cream and hot fudge. ... Let the dinner begin ... Again I will mention that the food was good. The service, however, was terrible. Drinks were never refilled, plates were never cleared. I was wondering if we picked a table without a server assigned to it, but there was ample staff working.   Looking at the employees I noticed that nobody smiled. Not a single employee seemed to enjoy their job. This was a terrible place to work. Waiters and waitresses pushed their way through customers. Customers are nothing more than an inconvenience to the staff.  OK, time for Ice Cream!!! I stood at the counter, but the single employee behind that counter was rolling some balls of dough. Her back was to us and we could not get her attention. Yes, once again, customers are nothing more than an inconvenience to the staff. I gave up on the Ice Cream and went to the chocolate fountain. There was a single green strawberry and the chocolate was foaming. (I'll pass on that).  The cookies were good. A second trip to the ice cream bar was a waste of time, as there was more bread dough to roll.  Of the 5 of us, two people said they would come back despite the poor service. Myself and my date felt differently. We agreed never again. The 5th person was indifferent, saying \"I could take it or leave it\". Seeing how 60% of the Golden Corral's new customers have no plans on returning, I now understand why there was no line at the front.  In the restroom there is a sign that states: \"Employees must wash their hands before returning to work\". This scared me, as we already determined that \"Signs here don't mean that much\"."}
{"text":"Second time in a row we had a problem. First off they were out of Vanilla soft serve ice cream for most of the visit. There was no hard scooped ice cream available because they said freezer was broken and the cotton candy machine wouldn't work. My family consists of 4  adults and 3 kids all of which were very let down given the deserts were not available. When I went to the manager, she seemed like I was a thorn in her backend and was Very Unpleasant!  Also, we told our server there was little ants or bugs crawling on the walls ( I have pictures)  and she said the manager would come over to reseat us but never did.  After spending over 87.00 and being let down for the second visit in a row, we decided to leave abruptly.  Probably won't go back and will definitely let others know about the bugs etc.."}
{"text":"Pitiful weekend. Loud noisy screaming kids everywhere. Place was trashed. Bakery closed at 6:45 because out of everything!!  Help tries but families just let kids run wild.   Then the only \"dessert\" was pure sugar on a stick....cotton candy!!  Imagine 11 pm and kids still on sugar high!  Wonder if they told people before they paid how many things they were out of.....provably not!"}
{"text":"As a rule I like the Golden Corral, this one was pretty clean, but the food could've been hotter, informed our server, they rectified the situation but was to late for us, food still had good flavor, pot roast is always some of the best, as well as the bourbon chicken, but it was cold normally if they're clean they're 4 stars but I was a little disappointed cause it wasn't as hot as normal"}
{"text":"Went here today with a friend of my. We both been shitting since we left, I couldn't even make it home had 2 find a gas station to poop at. Now I'm at work feeling like shit, running to the bathroom every five minutes, so embarrassing! Will never eat there again, if you don't want your butt to hurt you shouldn't either Called the store this morning, the \"manager\" didnt care we got sick trying to say we got sick somewhere else but that's the only place we eat yesterday. He said we can't have a refund we can come for a free meal, why would I want to eat there again? I just paid 30$ to get sick, never again!"}
{"text":"Food is great. Place is clean. The clam chowder is not bad but could be better. Great selection of food. Our server Sophia is amazing. She's very friendly and efficient. I will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"The first time I went I was rather excited that there was a new, upgraded buffet than the normal Hometown Buffet. After waiting in line, you walk in and pick up your drinks first - be warned: they cost extra - then you are directed to your table. The seating areas are rather cramped, so if you're a mommy who still carries around the carseat carrier, you might want to think twice about bringing it in with you.   The food here is good because they have a pretty large variety. The salad bar is way better than at Hometown. As for the main courses, they offer things from Chinese spring rolls to Italian lasagna. I was confused by the spinach dip near the pizza. It's there, but the chips you use to dip into it is on the other side of the buffet. They could need some more organization with their food placement. The dessert was ok. The ice cream isn't all that special. It's like regular ice cream. They have the chocolate fountain as advertised, and they even have a cotton candy machine. Overall, the dessert isn't anything to get too excited about.   The staff is nice and friendly. It gets pretty busy, so they run around trying to get everything guests ask for. They are also good about picking up the plates you're done with so you never have a pile of used dishes taking up space on your table.   Overall, Golden Corral is just the new \"in\" thing that everyone's jumping on the bandwagon to try. It's just like when BJ's first opened. Eventually people will get tired of it and it'll be just another restaurant to choose from for Saturday night dinners."}
{"text":"After seeing so many negative reviews, I decided to pay another visit and see if things had gotten bad.  I went a little before 4pm (Saturday), avoiding the dinner rush, and all I can say is I have nothing to complain about.  The only thing even slightly annoying was that they were apparently changing out the cash register drawers when I got there, and the registers were unattended for a couple of minutes, so I had to wait.  I didn't use the restroom; the rest of the facility was reasonably clean (especially for someplace so busy). Tables were being cleared constantly, and the floor was swept twice while I was there.  If the staff weren't overly friendly, at least they were courteous and competent. More than anything else, they looked tired. I'd guess anyone who works at GC works harder than at a similar-sized casino buffet.  Everything I had today was good.  Fried rice was better than last time. All the fried items I had were very good, especially the Southern fried fish.  The woody bottoms hadn't been trimmed off the asparagus, but other than that they were fine. I also had salad, fried chicken, mashed potatoes & gravy, hush puppies, BBQ ribs, mac & cheese, and a coconut creme tart. My table was cleared promptly, and my drink was refilled promptly."}
{"text":"Food was great. Employees were great. The neighborhood, not so great. I guess for the cost, and if you want a buffet, away from the strip, this is the place to go. I never felt in danger or anything but, it's not the \"strip\" atmosphere."}
{"text":"Took the family there last night. After reading all the reviews I was not expecting much. Got there about 6:30 PM. Was in line for only about 15 -20 min. Once we paid we found our table. Started to get our food. Not expecting much I was surprised. All the food was really good. Nothing we tried was cold or tasted like it had been sitting out forever. Our server was slow at first but I think she was the only one for our area. I asked for a medium rare steak and I got medium rare. Maybe it was the time we went but I didn't see any unruly kids or rude people. If it wasn't so far away I would be a regular."}
{"text":"My family came here for dinner on a Monday night and there was no wait!  I was pretty excited since it was my first time to Golden Corral.  With all the hype, I had high expectations.  I can't say I was disappointed, but this buffet definitely didn't meet all the hype that has been going around.  It's better than Hometown, but a pale comparison to many Vegas buffet like people claim.  The pot roast, shrimp dishes, and meatballs were good.  The rare piece of beef I asked for was actually well done side piece with a tad of red on the cut portion.  It was sort of dry and okay at best.  The desserts were too sweet, but I did enjoy the chocolate lava cake and the carrot cake with the frosting scraped off.  I heard that their food quality went down a lot as of late and it's pretty believable.  Dinner ~ $12 per person with drink ~ $2.50 per person   Okay."}
{"text":"The best service of any restaurant ever ask for Jesus!  Outside of Vegas this is The Buffet!  Assortment, decent quality, great price.  Dianne runs the joint like a machine!  Any time we are within 20 miles at meal time, you know where we will be!"}
{"text":"To quote Arrest Development, \"I've made a huge mistake.\""}
{"text":"After  years of seeing the commercials for Golden Corral, I was excited to hear that one was finally opening up in Las Vegas.  Gone would be the days of contemplating a drive to Kingman AZ or Hesperia CA to dine at what looks like a really great place.  Having now been twice within two weeks (against my better judgement), I can honeslty say I am let down.  I remember going to a Golden Corral as a kid.  It had the best baked potato bar around.  I can remember my family being so upset when they went out of business in SoCal.  This, however, is not the same Golden Corral I remember from back then.  It is just your average every day run of the mill over priced buffett with chceap food.  Not that it is all bad.  The salad bar is solid and seemed mostly fresh.  And the Ceasar dressing is on point.  The hot food though, hit and miss really.  The Bourbon Street chicken was perhaps my favorite dish of the night.  The orange pork was alright as was the sesame chicken but neither were anything worth writing home about.  The egg roll was small and chewy. The lo mein was made with the same noodles as the spaghetti.  That kind of threw me off.  Neither were the kind of noodles I think they strived to be. The meatloaf was smothered in ketchup the way my mom made it when I was a kid so that was nice.  The green bean casserol was good if for no other reason than it was covered with fried onions which happen to be one of my favorite snacks.  My dad and step-mom spent a few minutes discussing the sausage with bell pepper and onion trying to determie what kind of sausage it was.  The sign said it was Italian sausage.  If it takes two people immersed in conversation for five minutes and a third party to finally look at the sign to know for sure what it was, it was probably not the best representation of that food.  On to dessert, the bread pudding was awesome the first time I went while the cobler was not worth more than two bites.  The second visit had the bread pudding looking so horrible I just moved right past it and onto the pies. I got a slice of apple pie.  The apple filling was fine but the crust was not good.  It lacked flavor and the texture was dry and crumbly.  Not flakey likea good pie crust should be.  As for the chocolate fountain that seems to be like a signature of the chain, it seems very unsanitary.  You have this recirculation of liquid chocolate that sees children coating more than their desserts.  I saw hands going in there too.  Furthermore, these desserts are taken out of the restaurant leading to food sticks, food and stickiness all over the parking lot.  It was more sticky than a movie theatre floor.  My dad has said he will not be back and I have to agree.  In a town full of buffets, there are better quality options with better prices."}
{"text":"I love this place .If somethings not right the manager will take care of it.We always get wonderful customer service and the taste is consistent."}
{"text":"Food is always tasty and service is good. I really wish the dessert table had more options for the chocolate fountain. Marshmallows and pretzels are not enough! Where are the strawberries? Another complaint would be allow made to order steaks during lunch. I came for the sole purpose of eating a steak a few rolls and a salad. The guy told me they didn't make made to order steaks until 4:30! So lame!"}
{"text":"My family and I tried the Golden Coral in Hesperia, CA a few years back. When we learned there was a Golden Coral here in Las Vegas, we had to try it out. The selection is good and food quality overall is pretty decent. I was impressed with the baked chicken. Usually, chicken can be dry at other restaurants, but the chicken here was juicy and very tender. My kids loved the selection and went back about 5 times to refill their plates. Prices are decent and they do give discounts to children under 12. Weekends are usually busy, so expect some wait times. Service is good as our waitress checked up on us frequently and cleared our table of finished plates. Worth a try if you live locally or are visiting from out of town."}
{"text":"I used to come here a couple years ago but I stopped coming because this place was too unrefined. I started going to the Robinson location because it was a bit more nicer.   After moving away from Pittsburgh, I was excited to come back this month and hit up my favorite all-you-can-eat buffet. Since the Golden Corral in Robinson was too long of a distance, we ended up coming here instead.   This Golden Corral has gotten worse since I last came here. The food lacks seasoning and is either under or overcooked. I remember years ago going to GC with friends and one of them said, \"You gotta be a damn fool to come all the  way here just to eat a salad!\" We laughed and nodded in agreement because we thought GC food was the diggity back then. But now? The best thing you can get here is a salad!   Oh yeah, I can't forget the dessert station! Messy with empty trays containing crumbs. The chocolate fountain was turned off and the small amount of chocolate that remained was dried up and appeared parched. It was like a chocolate desert. The chocolate ice cream looks like poo. The sugar free desserts were hardly touched. I saw many people had bypassed the dessert station and got fresh fruit instead.   If you want to come here and be entertained, then by all means come here. I find the food here to be mediocre but different strokes for different folks!"}
{"text":"Surprise surprise! I love Golden Corral, yes I said it. There were a lot of obstacles in my way that could have changed my rating, but the quality of the food, the variety, the price and the wonderful service really came through for them.  The long wait before you can even enter the restaurant could be a big dealbreaker for a lot of people, we waited for about 25-30 mins before we got seated, not bad at all.  The crowds inside the restaurant itself could drive a person insane, you want personal space, not in here, there is no personal space at all, everyone is in your face and walking in front of you, back of you, side of you, stepping on you, it's a mad house in there.  If you can get over these issues, the food is really good and there is something for everyone, you cannot go wrong. So much to choose from, it was awesome, I loved it.  The service was excellent, we had Joanne from Texas with a sweet little accent and she was great, just a lovely lady. Very attentive, our drinks never ran empty, the plates never piled up, she had such a great attitude, she made the meal even more enjoyable.  Don't let the lines scare you, just be patient and you will be rewarded."}
{"text":"Delicious, warm, fresh just a few positives. my waiter was constant but nice. Never had a bad experience so far.   One note, I have read that the bathroom is dirty I have yet to find the men's bathroom dirty."}
{"text":"A few weeks ago was my very first visit to the Golden Corral buffet. The selection of the food was decent and the restaurant was clean. Some items were good, the southern cooking items: black eyed peas and greens. And, some items were not so good: the mac and cheese. I wanted some mac and cheese to go with my chicken and veggies, but I quickly noticed a pan of mac and cheese that so soupy it really should have been dumped in a double boiler pot and placed in the \"soup\" section of the buffet. I picked up the serving spoon, dipped into the water mac and cheese and tilted the spoon to really get a visual. The mac and cheese poured off the serving spoon with the exact consistency of water and pasta. The staff behind the glass asked, \"may I help you?\" I showed them the watery mess and said, \"this is mac and cheese is soup.\" The kitchen manager then instructed the cook/helper to replace it with a fresh batch. I then saw the cook/helper take a very large, steaming hot, plastic bag that contained the macaroni and cheese they serve. So the \"homemade\" mac and cheese actually comes out of a heated plastic bag. She cut the bag open and poured the mixture in a tin pan. I instantly noticed THAT mac and cheese was just as soupy as the what she was replacing! Then she proceeding to replace one soupy pan of mac and cheese for another soupy pan of mac and cheese! The kitchen manager saw me see this. I said, \"that pan is just as watery as THIS pan.\" Then the other kitchen manager explained, \"we changed vendors and that's how the mac and cheese comes to us.\" Wow. I put some on a plate a took a photo of it. I've never seen anything like it. I can't imagine why they thought serving such slop was acceptable and that no one would notice. The food was nothing to rave about and certainly not good enough for me to become a regular diner there. The spaghetti and sauce was comparable to something you'd fine in a really bad cafeteria. Finally, if I do return (which I'm not sure I will), I certainly will steer clear of their prepacked, over cooked, watery mac and cheese."}
{"text":"Wow.  Never thought the day would come when I would review a Golden Corral.  However this past glorious Sunday my WT family, when told they could pick ANYWHERE they wanted to go for lunch, no need to worry about the tab, they picked the GC.   This was my first experience with this place. I've only done buffets in Vegas.   Currently my doctor has me on a strict Vegan diet, so I already knew I was in for it with selection food wise.   I was excited to see the spinach and green beans, and then disappointed when I saw they were loaded with ham or bacon. Wah wah.   I had some very water logged Brussels sprouts. Some steamed carrots. Pears and beets that for sure came out of a can. Some french fries and a wheat roll.   When Our waitress sat us, I asked her if any of the rolls were vegan. I got a blank stare and then the \"I don't know what you are talking about\" response. I explained to her what vegan was, she then pointed to the bakery area and told me I would have to flag down one of the bakers if I wanted to know what was in the rolls. So I did, and the baker was very friendly and pointed out to options I could have. Score!   Our waitress was really very friendly and came by the table often.   This was for sure not a place for me. Its all institutional food, boiled and over cooked beyond belief."}
{"text":"A glorified Hometown Buffet with surprisingly attentive service.  Things you can do here: -------------------------------- * Check out the choco fondue and cotton candy machine * Eat the larger fried shrimp nearer to the Salad bar, than the popcorn shrimp found with the rest of the seafood selection * Sit on the left side of the entrance if you have bladder problems * Stuff yourself so much you can't grab Half & Half afterwards * Celebrate your birdday here -- practically every table was doing it! * Marvel at how packed the large restaurant is, and question whether the economy really is in a recession currently  Things to skip here: -------------------------- * Haggle out of paying full priced $11.79 weekday dinners (+$0.20 on weekends) * The Sirloin steaks -- I thought I was gnawing on a thick slab of beef jerky with a smokey aroma * Expecting home-cooked, baked-from-scratch food -- The clam chowder tasted like it was heated straight out of a Campbell's can  Glad I got to try this buffet, but not a place I would particularly go out of my way for. The price is cheap, but I can better utilize $12 on the plenty of restaurants with better tasting food, made with higher-quality ingredients, with tummy room to breathe."}
{"text":"I would give this place zero stars if it were an option. This is the filthiest place I've ever been. The women's bathroom was disgusting, the toilet in the handicap stall wasn't even attached to the floor and made the entire restroom smell like raw sewage. The dishes were dirty, I had to go through 7 soup bowls before I found a clean one, same for the plates. The grill cooks don't know how to cook a steak, the gave my husband one that was completely raw, he asked for medium rare. When my husband bright the steak up to be remade, the guy behind the grill gave my husband attitude and started getting really nasty. At this point we spoke to the manager, she got rude with me when I told her what had happened and assumed we just wanted a free meal. I told her we hadn't even been there for 15 minutes. By then we were so disgusted, we didn't even want to eat there. She ended up refunding us and we left. I ended up playing it safe and cooking at home. Be warned, eat here at your own risk!"}
{"text":"We ate here a couple years ago, and it was really good. However, in october, we stopped here to eat dinner on our way back home from Ohio. It was HORRIBLE.... It was dirty, the food wasn't good, and they were unable to keep up with restocking food on the buffet. It reminded me how the Ponderosa in Altoona was before it went out of business"}
{"text":"Food was good until I found a bug crawling on the table. My appetite is gone. Talk to Monica(supervisor). She said nothing she can do about it because the kids were already eating desserts. Which I was still eating my food. She was very rude about it. And I would not be coming back!"}
{"text":"I had Golden Corral for the first time today - my boyfriend was determined to have a buffet for new years eve before his new years resolution kicks in. It wasn't bad but it really wasn't great.  Good: 1. The bread rolls and honey spread were AMAZING. I dare say they're as good as the rolls at Olive Garden, even though the ones at Olive Garden taste like they're healthier. These rolls were oozing with butter but they tasted heavenly. 2. The price for a lunch buffet is really good. It was only $17 for the two of us for all you can eat. Drinks are extra, but we just got water. 3. I read some of the other reviews saying that there was bad service, but our waitress was really friendly and helpful.  Bad: The food is decidedly meh. There's a good selection, but it's not very good quality and didn't taste that good. The vegetables at the salad bar look like they were dumped out from a bad of defrosted frozen vegetables. All the fruit looked canned. Most of the meat dishes were overdone and dry. No wonder they can charge so little.  If you're not picky and want to just eat a lot for not a lot of money, then this is great for you. But if you're looking for a culinary experience...then neah."}
{"text":"Pointless. If you want a \"Stations\" casino buffet, come here. Old, watery food, dirty old plates. There were a lot of people there for dinner who all had similar facial expressions as mine. Not a good choice by any means, won't ever waste my money here again."}
{"text":"Ok guys, brace yourself. I did not have a good experience here! I know I'm shocked too. Here is the breakdown:  Positive: The cashier at the entrance was super nice and explained how this place worked. If I was rating them on her customer service it would have been 5 stars. Our server(?) was also great, a bit absent at times but no real problems!  Negative: Here we go, and btw I don't ever want to leave negative things but it is what it is. First, The other patrons were mean and down right nasty, apparently they were under the assumption when something is empty it will not be refilled. In case you don't know it's a buffet. Second: Once I was done letting all the OG's from the nursing home get there food, the food I got was tasteless, mislabeled, and to add insult to injury really not good at all. Third and lastly, I made it 2 hours before everything I ate came back up. Don't recommend, best of luck if you go there!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast there this Sunday morning and I must say I was pleasantly surprised. Arrived just after it opened, expecting a long line, but we got right in. Everything was clean and fresh.  The scrambled eggs were actually moist and delicious.  Every tray of food looked as fresh as if it had JUST been put out, although some were already half empty. The kitchen was working hard to keep the trays stocked as they got close to being empty.  The steam tables were sparkling clean, and the plates and silverware were, too. Our server was quite attentive...refilling our coffee even before we had a chance to finish the cup.  She noticed my milk was 2/3rds gone and asked if I wanted another.   My only \"con\" is that the recipes for a few of their items (i.e. chipped beef on toast, and gravy for biscuits) are rather tasteless, but there are enough other options available that it is not a problem to skip those few bland items.  I do wish these buffets would not water down their fruit juices so much. Really takes the enjoyment (and taste) out of having a glass of orange juice with breakfast.  Otherwise, I would recommend this location to anyone in the mood for a decent buffet meal.  Kudos for a shop well run."}
{"text":"We love Golden Coral.  We used to eat at the Surprise,AZ location all the time. After we moved, we decided to try a closer location - on W. Thomas. ZERO STARS HERE... Never again will we eat there.  The place was filthy. Food all over the carpet, sticky tables, stuck-on food all around the steam table trays,empty salt and pepper shakers,  and extremely rude employees. We stopped in around 7pm, so there was still plenty of time before they closed. The steam trays were almost empty - all of them -- and what was still there was over-cooked, dried-out, stuck-on globs of yuck.  Nobody seemed concerned about re-stocking (I guess because there was still a tablespoon or two of food permanently crusted onto the trays, so technically they were not yet empty). What little we managed to salvage to put on our plate was disgusting. How can anyone ruin canned corn?!?    To make matters worse, we had to look hard to find a clean plate - through several of them before we were successful.  The silverware was the same.  We pulled several of each utensil before finding one without food stuck to it. When we showed this to the server, she just shrugged her shoulders and walked away. She didn't even take the dirty plates/silver with her.    The table next to us had several people of various ages...one in a high-chair, twin toddlers in diapers,one young child, mom, and grandma.  There was food all over the place.  (Parents, if you take your children out to eat, PLEASE teach them some manners.  It is NOT appropriate to continually throw food on the floor, and it is DEFINITELY not cool to drop cotton candy on the floor, then pick it up and continue to eat it!!).  Anyway....after they left, the mess was huge.  The server removed the dishes, etc, then swept the chunks of food ONTO THE CARPET instead of onto one of the dirty dishes. After taking the dishes to the back, she returned, wiped off the chairs, and then WITH THE SAME CLOTH, wiped off the table.  EXCUSE ME.  You just had 2 toddlers in diapers (and no other bottoms)(and I can attest to the fact that at least one had a lumpy, dirty diaper!), sitting on that chair.  You wiped it with a dish cloth, and then used that same dish cloth to wipe off the surface of the table, where we put our silverware and food?!?  Are you insane?!?  If you don't have the sense to use two different cloths, at lease please wipe off the table with a clean cloth first, THEN the seats...and then GET A NEW CLEAN CLOTH before you wipe down the next table.  She never did return to clean the food off the floor. When we left we had to be careful not to step into any of it or we probably would have slipped and ended up sitting on the floor!  My recommendation - avoid this location unless you are starving and nothing else is open.  We still prefer the Surprise, AZ location, or the Northern Ave,PHX location. Both of them are clean, well stocked, and the people are extremely nice."}
{"text":"OMG i love this place!!!!!!!!!!!!! third times the charm!! we have been trying to come to this place for the past few weeks lol this was out third and final try! we came at lunch time on a friday afternoon. all together with drinks it came out to about $20. i absolutely love that you can see the cooks there doing their thing!! the mini steak burgers were amazing! the salad bar was full of fresh veggies! their fried chicken was ok..toooo moist for my taste(not that i like dry chicken lol) i didnt get a chance to try everything, obviously, who does at a buffet with so many items to choose from!  out \"waitress\" was super nice and very attentive! the desserts were amazing as well! i got soft served ice cream with brownies and peach cobbler lol. i left this place feeling full, but not over stuffed, suprisingly lol   i will definetly be back! but not on weekends cause the lines are waaay too long!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best American buffet under $15-and I eat A LOT of buffets... from Korean bbq to Chinese buffet to Wynn in Vegas!  And no... im not fat.  Just watch for the lines-often, they are 30+ minutes long!"}
{"text":"Logistics: Came around 11am on Sunday with a party of 7. The line was out the door and onto the asphalt of the parking lot. 50 minute wait. The line got even longer as we waited. Crowded, hectic and large restaurant. Clean bathrooms. Good for large parties. Didn't have problem with parking.  Food: Almost everything I had was below average. For example, the orange chicken at panda express is better than golden corral. The person cooking the steaks was an amateur. Salad and fruit wasn't as fresh as souplantation. The only decent things I had was the pot roast, chicken wings, wheat buns and cookies and cream ice cream. A lot of their foods have trans fat. That is unacceptable. I made a list from the nutrition facts on their website and avoided those foods.  Service: Good and frequent. There was always a few people asking us what we wanted to drink. I prefer if they just have the soda machines out and we can help ourselves.   Overall: I won't be coming back. Similar to home town and debatable which one has better quality. I'll stick with souplantation. We paid 13 per person and the value wasn't there. Don't understand why this place is so popular. The trans fat part really bothered me."}
{"text":"Food is good but the place is dirty it has this werid smell like a musty smell.and children are all over the place without an adult touching food."}
{"text":"Omg it was so dirty I did not eat.... chicken on floor people were crackheads there forks were dirty.... carpet filthy don't go here I refused to eat it was so nasty the worst and dirtiest restaurant I have ever been in!! Disgraced go to old country buffet 1000 times better and cleaner"}
{"text":"I love just about every buffet known to man but you couldn't drag me back here even if the food was free. The restaurant is dirty and the food is lousy. I've never been to another Golden Corral (although I've been to this location 3x) to know if this is par for the course but this place is just plain nasty."}
{"text":"We came in to eat, picked up some fried shrimp and cocktail sauce. I ate a couple then I noticed a thin Brown hair covered in grease on the plate which obviously came from the fried shrimp. I waved down a waiter who I showed the hair to. She showed it to a cook who saw it, who handed it off to another cook. They took it to the manager who came out with the plate with the hair now removed from the plate after 4 people handling my food. She stated it must have flown off the plate because she couldn't see it anymore. They said they would remove the items from the buffet. They never did. After deciding to stay anyways and try to enjoy my meal, I went to the salad bar. When I went to get the ranch for my salad, there was a dead fly in the ranch. They never apologized, just removed the ranch and gave me a new container of ranch to dish from. I don't think I will be visiting this location again."}
{"text":"The food was good and very reasonably priced. However, it is not so good that it warrants a 1 hour wait. When the line stretches out the door and around the block, I go elsewhere.   Guess what?!!! There is a Souplantation about a block away!"}
{"text":"This is located on the east side, near Charleston and Lamb, near the Home Depot, so you may see some day workers there. (Just a warning, maybe some of you have not seen that yet.) Large parking lot. You pay before entering the dining area. You sit where you choose. Lots of tables and booths too. We came for breakfast.  Ok, it was better than I expected, but because of reviews here (average 3 star rating) and what I had heard from many other people who've been before, I didn't have high expectations (although my in-laws like it, but they don't dine out a whole lot, either). I can best liken it to a typical casino buffet, except with a chocolate dipping fountain. We went for breakfast on sunday, and it was rather empty at the beginning, but I did notice many patrons were of the bigger set (sorry, I am being honest). Towards the end as we were leaving, there were more and more people.  I didn't eat the mexican food or salad bar (pretty decent selection) because I didn't feel like it that morning. I am pretty picky at these types of buffets anyway (asian buffets included). I had the biscuit and gravy (don't get the ones sitting on the trays, rather get the ones laying on top of other biscuits; I didn't eat the bottom layer because it was tough). I also had the hash, eggs, a third of my husband's made-to-order omelette (that was good, but tends to be a little greasy), and a fried egg that my MIL gave me (they also do fried eggs, that is neat!). Our son had the ham and banana nut french toast with strawberry syrup. I don't know why there was no regular syrup option; all I found was the sugar-free bottles of syrup. Hubby had the potatoes, said it was really good, but the omelette was the best thing there (except the onions and peppers were pre-cooked and greasy). There is a dessert station: bananas, box cereal- two choices, rice crispie treats- cubes, mini carrot cake muffins, and hand-dipped ice cream. At 10:30 am, the macaroons were taken out. (Certain items get released at certain times.)  Juice (clear cups) is included- Minute Maid Apple Juice, Orange, Passion Orange Guava (POG), and another one but can't recall it right now as I am writing up this review. Red cups are for water.   The service was really good. The empty plates were taken away pretty fast. The plates and utensils were filled up pretty good. The tables were clean and I noticed that the vacated tables were getting attention pretty quick."}
{"text":"Oh, Golden Corral. I used to eat at you when I was a kid and you were in Fresno. I loved your pizza and rolls.   The boyfriend and I went here last night... we toughed it out and waited for 45 minutes. It was well worth the wait, if you're looking for a buffet. The price is actually really decent, especially when it is 2 for $20. There are a lot of choices, from stir fry to steak (cooked to order) to pot roast (holy cow- to die for) to cotton candy to orange chicken to pasta... pretty much something for everyone. WAY better than any buffet I have ever been to. My favorites were the steak, ham and pot roast. Least favorites were the bourbon chicken and the peach cobbler.   The service is great too. Once seated, our waitress came and chatted with us a bit and was on top of refilling our drinks and taking our plates the entire night.   A lot of people have a problem with the setup of the place, especially the whole wait in line- get your drink- pay- get seated thing... it really wasn't that bad. Actually, with how attentive the wait staff was, not being able to refill your own drinks wasn't an issue at all. And the line, especially near the registers, IS hectic... but only because it's really crowded and busy right now. I'm assuming that will die down and it will be a lot easier to handle.   Hopefully the newness wears off and the line gets shorter- but hopefully the amazing service and food quality stays!"}
{"text":"Super packed with kids running around without supervision... not the restaurants fault, but still affects my experience.  Besides that, every piece of food I tried was pretty good.  At buffets, I'm a one-scooper so I get to try everything I want.  The price was decent for a buffet selection like this, service was good, and I can't complain about anything else."}
{"text":"The selection of food was lacking Wednesday night. The only meat they had on the carving board was a huge ham and it looked dry. I didn't dare try it. There were no jumbo shrimp or any of the prime rib and hardly any other beef choices.It was all mainly chicken aside from one beef roast. I was very disappointed.For the price we paid I expected more. In retrospect the salad bar part of the buffet was extremely good and so was the dessert bar. The service was very slack hence the 2 and not 3 star rating."}
{"text":"This was my first time ever visiting Golden Corral, I kinda lost the meaning of buffet coming here. Not to mention the trips to the bathroom after eating here. Very upset this Golden Corral was so nasty! The poor over worked waiters I pray for you all. It was like eating in a filthy kitchen disgusting for $80.00. Had to leave early all five of us got sick and parents learn to fix your children food. Family restaurant was like an all you can eat at a welfare office only thing missing was security."}
{"text":"Good variety of foods and good service.Long lines and drinks are not self serve after the first time.Everything tasted good.I especially loved the rotissire chicken,wok area,and the ice cream that they offer.Definitely be back in the near future. I thing that bothered me was the glass that covered the food was so big its hard for tall people to grab the back food!"}
{"text":"Gross, gross, gross, gross, gross!!!   Poor quality, though I thought it was really cool that they had a chocolate fountain and cotton candy. However, even those were really disgusting...   I didn't really like anything. Food quality is the same as home town. I really don't know how people are saying it's better... I could make better food at home..   Line is ridiculous. Please go during an weird hour if you really, really want to try this place (like I did..) because you will be extremely furious to have waited two hours to eat this mediocre crap.   The only thing that made me happy here was that there was a birthday and the guy leading the staff into singing happy birthday accidently announced it was home town buffet about three times before getting it right. LOLOL."}
{"text":"The wife and I came here for the first time this evening and I just say I was pleasantly  surprised ! My expectations were pretty low when we thought about coming here.   First off the wait staff is pretty amazing !  They kept that place pretty clean considering the mob of people's coming in !  The wait staff were all friendly and accommodating  !   You get three stars because  The bathrooms were absolutely disgusting !  The wait staff was amazing  The different areas to get food were all up kept very well!  The only area in disarray would be the desserts area to get dessert. but I am giving some leniency since there was like four or five birthday party's happening all around the area we were sitting !  All with young kids !   I probably would have only gave two stars but the waitstaff was just so amazing and exceeded my expectations ! Of all you can eat Buffett'!"}
{"text":"the lunch buffet is very cheap! food quality is whatevers; you pay for what you get.  there are many selections and varieties. this place is very chaotic and busy,  service was pretty good; friendly staff members. i personally prefer golden corral  than hometown buffet mainly because of the price, and quality of food is also similar."}
{"text":"I love buffets, and I was excited for this one, but it was crap.  Cons -They don't have the bbq wings they're currently advertising, which was the whole reason we went there. We went during dinner hours, when the website says they have them, but they didn't. I asked if they were going to bring them out, and they said no.  -Girlfriend tried getting a well-done steak. The guy kept telling her to come back in 5 more minutes, which she did 5 times before we left without ever getting it.  -We had to wait in line for an hour and 20 minutes.  -The food was a slight step up from Hometown Buffet, but there wasn't much that you couldn't buy out of a box at Walmart.  -Total cost for both of us was $30 (2 buffets + 1 drink + tax) We should have just gone to Wingstop, where $30 would have bought us more than all we could eat, plus sides and dessert.   Pros -If you like steak (but not well-done) you might be able to get your money's worth here."}
{"text":"Endless seafood buffet!!!  That is all.  No really, why do I keep yelping up chains? Because they are very interesting to me, especially the ones that are packed to the brim like this one, and all for only $9.99! Everything you can imagine. There is so much food to try that you can't even get to the desserts.   Also, I am kind of surprised by the dummy down below who expects plates to be handed to him. Its a buffet asswipe, get a clue. However, the one thing I will mention that differed from the one i went to in Florida...you have to seat yourself. Ok, pretty easy right? No, not when its packed. It would be nice if they had peeps keeping tracking of where the open tables are at. Oh but one thing I did like was the self serve bread because there were like 10 different kinds to choose from.  Now, carry on."}
{"text":"Racist against white people. Wouldn't give us another piece of steak and just shook their heads. When the guys behind us got their second round, it wasn't a problem. Them being the same race couldn't be a coincidence. We were polite and everything. I will never give them another cent."}
{"text":"I always see their commercials on tv and always hear people raving about them...so we gave in, and decided to go with the crowd.  First of all pricing, is no great feat. at $11.99 + $1.99(Drink) you are looking at the same price as a buffet at one of the casinos... We knew this going in but people said that it was \"Southern Comfort Food\" so we should try it.   Everything that they have at this buffet, except the chocolate fountains, is found at any other buffet in Las Vegas... for a better price and quality as well.... Their food is typical of a regular buffet and besides their chocolate fountains, nothing stands out.   You seat yourself during the slow periods and then get seated during busy times. Alot of their items were out as well throughout the buffet including their deviled eggs and the pizza was empty every time we got up to get some.   At least at a casino buffet, they refill everything right away. And the service is way better. The waiters here are so overworked that they tend to ignore tables, not their fault though.  Will I come back? No, honestly, but they seemed VERY busy so obviously I may be missing something here...."}
{"text":"TLDR: good food, good service, customers from hell. To me, Golden Corral is a miraculous place. I'm German so this buffet is a great opportunity for me to try some classic American dishes (my fiance says these dishes are of course not comparable to real home-cooked typical American dishes, but I think most of what I tried was pretty tasty). There are some things that I enjoy a lot (chicken noodle soup, collard greens, the entire dessert buffet) and some I wouldn't eat again if you'd pay me (marshmallow covered sweet potatoes, seriously people... that's an abomination!).  Overall, the selection and taste is definitely decent for the price.  What I don't enjoy too much about GC is these horribly colored plastic plates. Any food looks a lot less appealing when it sits on an ugly blue plate full of scratches. But that is a minor thing to me.  What really bothers me though are the other costumers. I won't take off a star for it because it's not GC's fault but I will rant:  If you take your kids to a buffet instruct them to keep their fingers out of the food. If they're not old or willing enough to fill their own plates without causing a huge mess then fill their plates for them.   Don't let your kids eat so much that they throw up right in the restaurant between other people eating. Happened twice under the eyes of my family, they were not amused, as well as the other costumers.  Dear old people, we all know you love hard candy for whatever reason, but stuffing your pockets with spoonfuls of hard candy from the dessert bar, come on....   The buffet is regularly stacked again, so there is no need to revive the good ol' days of the Great Depression and fight over the last pieces of fried chicken. Nobody will starve right here at Golden Corral, I promise.  You don't cough over the food while you spoon it onto your plate. Yes, that's not the kids who do that, it's the adults who apparently forget their manners while greedily grabbing as many bread rolls as they can possibly carry.  So, I'll come back again, and if it's just to judge the other customers with a smug look on my face while I enjoy my collard greens."}
{"text":"Saturday night at the Corral! YEAH! The only other one I've been to was in Missouri five years ago and I remember smuggling the honey buns back to Cali. It's worth the money and wait. It's the hometown buffet crowd with a cheaper version of a high end Vegas buffet. A buffet with steak and steak burgers is worth stopping at. Check it out if you're in the area because these are few and far between in Cali."}
{"text":"I came in here expecting very little and I was pleasantly surprised. If I had to choose between Sizzler and Golden Corral, I'd go with GC. The food is NOT top quality, but it's not really cheap either. The only thing that I can say I really don't like, is the line to get in. If you come at the wrong time, you feel like you're in line for Space Mountain. (You know where you hate waiting, but you know that when you get to the front of the line, you'll be happy you waited.)  Anyhow, they have your basic buffet set-up: Asian, Mexican, Seafood, Salads, Desserts, yadda yadda. The one thing that everyone seems to love, not moi, is that you can get cotton candy. I don't understand the fascination. Maybe it's because you only seem to get it when you're at a fair, or a ball game, so it makes it seem \"special.\"  If you decide to go, remember that they switch to dinner pricing at 4pm. So, I would get there around 3:30 so that you can still gets lunch pricing, but be able to partake in their dinner buffet. That pretty much means steak!"}
{"text":"Something tells me that if you don't speak Spanish you're not welcome here and it's interesting how the employees stare at you,  if you get any food from the buffet. I asked the manager why she had all the containers on the salad bar off of the salad bar and she said that that's what they normally do. I explained that I counted at least 10 containers out of chiller and it didn't seem to be a concern of hers. However she did advise me that they'll be closing down the salad bar and if I already had my plate. Maybe I misunderstanding the term buffet. I won't be coming here again."}
{"text":"Where to start?  Maybe it's because we went there for brunch. The place feels like the old buffets in Vegas, with drab decor and extra large and above clientele. There are a few edible items but most are just average or below. Even the fruit taste just okay. Not fresh and juicy. At least it's dirt cheap at less than $10 for adult sans the carbonated drinks.  I think the main draw is just the cheapness."}
{"text":"I came here on a Tuesday afternoon before a holiday at 4pm. There was no line outside of the building, but crowded inside. I would believe this is equivalent as Hometown Buffet. I left around 6pm, there were a lot less people eat and pretty much no line.   When I go up to get steak, I've always gotten a small piece with the fatty parts. One time I asked for medium rare, and gotten a piece that was straight up raw. I saw a lot of people going for the mac and cheese. I believed that it was going to be good, so I got myself a good serving, and a small portion of that was cold.  I'd probably come here again if there wasn't a line."}
{"text":"Food is disgusting and all tastes the same. Not clean but our server was very nice. We came on sunday at 11am. GO TO 711 INSTEAD! Save yourself 15 bucks"}
{"text":"I love this Golden Corral it has great food and GREAT steak the people there are so nice and responsible. I definitely recommend this place to go eat. And I will totally come back!"}
{"text":"This was only my second time visiting a Golden Corral and I must say, this time I was much more impressed so I am glad that I waited to do my review. The restaurant itself was very clean and the staff was attentive. The idea of Golden Corral is super simple; you walk in, pay, grab a drink. pick your own seat, and go to the buffet. Super easy! There is no hassle in between of waiting to be seated or waiting for a drink or paying after. When you are done eating, you leave which is nice. There is essentially no waiting on anybody and when you are starving like we were, that is soooo nice!  The buffet is pretty extensive. They have everything from seafood, to meats, to salad, to soup, to chicken/tuna salads, to mexican, to I think you get the idea! Pretty much anything you are in the mood for, you can find here. The food seemed to be very fresh and I saw the staff switching out food often to keep it that way. There was almost too much to choose from. That's always my problem when I go to buffets, I fill up so fast that I can't enjoy everything! Such a dilemma! haha The dessert bar was something to note!! Not only did they have ice cream (soft and hard) but they also had a chocolate fondue fountain!!!! It cant get better than that! There were soooo many more desserts as well: pie, cake, cookies, brownies, etc. Again, another problem I face when I go to buffets, I NEVER have enough room for all the dessert. It's making me want to go back there right now just for the dessert.   Cant wait to go back and fill my belly again!"}
{"text":"For your own sake and your family's sake, please do not attempt to visit this Golden Corral Restaurant!  By far the absolute worst Golden Corral I've ever been to!  And to think I gave them my hard earned money to feed my family of four what amounted to table scraps that I'd be hesitant to give my begging dog!  The selection of food that was offered at the buffet was 20% full at best...and the 20% that was offered was dried out.  Several customers asked the manager (who was also grilling) if he would be filling up the buffet soon and he made some wise-ass remark about taking a while to complete the task.  He spoke to us as he was flipping 8 sliders on the grill for the 40+ customers in the building at the time.  When the sliders were done, two customers barged in and snagged them up!  That was it for the food for the day!  The manager provided us with one bucket of mashed potatoes to go along with our dried out chicken and okra!  Oh, I did see corn, dinner rolls and some pizza available.  We waited over an hour there and no new food provided! I had my greasy spoon and dirty fork ready, but the food never came out! What I did eat, exited my body very quickly after I left the building!  Don't even get me started about the men's bathroom!  Stall #1 was a biohazard!  FEMA should have been called in ASAP!  No toilet paper and water all over the floor (thus having to leave the building).  Behind the salad bar, one employee was pumping yellowish sludge out of what looked like a backed up washer.  The poor waitresses avoided eye contact for the most part because they knew what a dump the place is!  Golden Corral should just condemn their own place."}
{"text":"this is a great place to take young kids. Tues is family night and kids buffet is cheaper. Now this is exactly what you should expect, cafeteria food and lots of it. now the salad bar i love the new england clam chowder has always been good steaks are tasty but tough cuts of meats yeast rolls are the bomb fresh mac n cheese is ok mashed potatoes are real potates and i prefer the brown gravy on it what I like about this is you can just go get one bite of everything and then go back for what you like  the desserts are plentiful in options and supply. i dont like the ice milk instead of ice CREAM and that new chocolate fountain is entertaing but I found the choclate to be gritty like maybe made from a powder"}
{"text":"Dis.gus.ting. I'm still sick to my stomach a day after."}
{"text":"The service was excellent thank you Big Te for taking such good care of us! The food was amazing and they had hot fudge!!!! The only issues we had were the first dinner rolls we had were hard on the bottom and the mashed potatoes were to thin other than that everything was amazing! The restaurant was clean even with the amount of customers and the managers were assisting with cleanup! Two thumbs up!!!!"}
{"text":"Had a great courtesy meal due to Veteran's Day. The steak was excellent.   I've been here on other occasions too. And it is one of the better buffet restaurants in town. I like this place better than Old Country buffet."}
{"text":"To echo the previous reviewers, now I know that I was right to trust my instinct and have not been inside a Golden Coral Buffet until yesterday. At first when you walk in, you feel like you are in for a treat. Don't let the varieties fool you. The food is absolutely bland, tasteless and poorly prepared. Do you remember what your college cafeteria's buffet style food taste like? This is just like it. Out of all the options, there were only two things that I actually liked, their strawberry shortcake and their yeast rolls...even the yeast rolls are a bit strange, who wants honey on their rolls? If you are like me, looking for the butter, you won't find any, apparently it's a golden coral thing to have honey rolls.  If you try to get soup, they will all be so salty that you might as well have drank ocean water, other than that ocean water is poisonous but the soup here may as well be because you can't drink them anyway. The lasagna is so hard it is like a brick. To quote what my cousin literally said after he took a bite from his lasagna, \"oh man this tastes like crap\". My tortilla chips were pretty terrible, nothing but grease, no flavor no texture. Sautee mushroom too salty again and was cooked in pure fat.   Service-wise, pretty poor. You have to pay upfront before you eat, the lady at the cashier was quite rude. She is kind of slow and she gave us one less drinks than we paid for...We asked her for an extra drink, not only were she not apologetic, she even had an attitude. Way to go Golden Coral for putting someone like that as the first person your customers will encounter at your restaurant.   As  for the staffs who comes around to pick up your used buffet plates, they try. However, they need to be a bit more strategic. For the hour or so that I was dining at the restaurant, I heard at least 5 or 6 times where the staffs dropped plates or cups and spilled ice and drink on the floor. They also look like they are overwhelmed with plates by carrying way too many at a time.   The bathrooms needs extreme attention, it really smells bad in there. Maybe this is their way of making sure customers leave asap and not stick around for long."}
{"text":"Ichhhhh. Won't give it even one star. Steak - which came straight off the grill was COLD. Waaaaaay overpriced for the quality and the place is just dirty.  The waitress rocked.  Does that make it worth $33. for 2 seniors? I think not ever again..."}
{"text":"I'd like to start this review with a disclaimer: I hate buffets! They usually cost as much, If not more, than a traditional restaurant and the food is usually nasty. With that said, this golden corral was pleasantly different. The food was actually really good. Does it compare to an outback or lone star? Not even close, but for a buffet it was the best I've had yet (I would still prefer going to outback if given the choice). My family and I went on a Sunday and it was very packed - good sign. The buffet was vast with a ton of options. Nice salad bar. An amazing side dish selection with a lot of vegetables and several meat choices. I recommend giving this one a try."}
{"text":"We decided on Golden Corral for Easter this year as there were only 3 of us and it made more sense financially. We've been here in the past on holidays and have always had a pleasant experience. Today we showed up around 1pm and walked into disorganized chaos! The line wasn't too crazy, but there were people coming in from every direction and blocking the walk ways for other patrons who were trying to leave. After about 20 minutes of standing in line, the manager came out and started yelling directions at patrons who were already crowded in the lobby to \"form one line.\" Many of which, I'm sure, didn't budge because they didn't want to lose their place in line.The way she was shouting, no one was listening to her. Based on the fact that it was a holiday, perhaps she should've figured out a game plan BEFORE people started showing up as they've done in the past. This manager was no better when we were waiting for a table either. As the hostess was taking us to our booth, she pushed through and told her that we couldn't sit there because she was accommodating someone else. 5 minutes later, the manager let us sit there anyway. No one looked happy except for the woman getting drinks when you come in and the gentlemen cooking the steaks--which were tender and flavored well! After today, we may have to rethink where we go on our next holiday outing as we about lost our appetite before getting to our table thanks to the poor attitude of your manager on duty today. It takes a good leader to run a team, but she is not the type of leader I would want for myself."}
{"text":"Golden Corral has graced Las Vegas with its mediocre buffet in a city that is known for every casino, on just about every block, that has.... a buffet.  My husband and I decided to throw in the towel and try this place out. After months of seeing the parking lot full to the brim and lines out the door, we saw it wasn't TOO busy on a Saturday afternoon.  First impressions: You get your beverage before you pay, you are herded into the establishment like cattle, and lo and behold... you enter complete and utter MADNESS.  Pros - Selection is decent. Desserts are plentiful  Cons - Food is mediocre, the place is too small, and it is a mad-house.   Apparently the Golden Corral does not do a good job telling its guests to corral their CHILDREN. Although there are signs posted that say, \"Children must be accompanied by adults at all times.\", this suggestion is thrown out the window. Children run rampant in here without parental supervision, knocking into people, plowing their way into buffet lines. The adults here aren't any better. There's no rhyme or reason to how people get their food, there's no lines to speak of. It's an all-out brawl fest -- almost.  Cleanliness is an issue. My husband and I searched for a table and could not find a decently cleaned one, we had to wipe one down and remove dirty napkins just so we could have a place to eat. We also watched as a family with two small infants allows these children to sloppily plow through food and fling said food all over the floor - it was gross.  Overall - never again."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Waitresses were nice. The place is just dirty. Youngstown has an awesome one with more choices. But, this one needs attention. If you go, sit in Lois's section. She will take care of you!"}
{"text":"As far as buffets are concerned, I really haven't done a lot of buffets out of Asian buffets, so I'm not sure how American buffets are.  They had a wide selection of foods, which I will give that a 4 star.  They should probably take down some signs that say there are certain types of foods, but aren't.  As for cleanliness of the restroom and the eating area, I would give it pretty much a 1 star.  If someone spills something, get someone to clean it up.  They did not look short staffed at all.  It seems that cleanliness is a huge problem as we would see spills throughout the restaurant.  We were at the far east end and the restrooms were in the far west end.  As I walked from one end to the other, it wasn't just one spill, but probably more than a half dozen.  Come on.  The bathroom was literally gross, but I had to go.  I've seen restrooms at gas stations or at rest areas much cleaner than this place.  Actually restrooms at most Asian places, which sometimes it's not so great, were much cleaner and better than at least the lady's restroom.  I'm guessing the men's would be worse.  And, as people ate and left their plates to be picked up, it wasn't just our tables, but all the surrounding tables, the waitress wouldn't pick up the plates or clean up tables of people that had already left.  To the east of us, those people left more than 15 minutes before we left and the waitress (Casandra) never cleaned up their table or no bus person to do it.  However, Casandra did come and ask us during our probably 1.5 hrs there (this included my mom and 4 families with spouses and kids, a party of 17.  We're not slobs.  I don't know how many times she asked how things were, but she never took action of picking up our plates in a timely manner or refilling our waters.  It's not like we were camels and sucking up the water.  Then, the table to the west of us that had maybe 6-8 people, they left for probably half hour and Casandra never picked up or cleaned their table.  So we were surrounded by empty tables of plates piled high with dirty stuff all around.    So, for the waitressing service, I give it a 1 star, but because the guy doing the steaks was good and friendly, I would give him a 4 star.  Hopefully the other wait staff is much better.  Casandra was friendly, but she wasn't doing anything much other than continually in an annoying frequency asking how we were doing.  My mom always leaves a great tip, but even my mom was annoyed at the lack of good waitressing service and took back a part of a tip.  Honestly, at the Asian buffets we go to, they may not be the friendliest, but at least they keep removing unwanted dishes, filling our waters, keeping the place clean so we can keep eating.    The food was okay, mainly American stuff or Gringo styled ethnic foods.  So, I would give this a 4 star.  I'm probably being generous in giving this place a 3 star, but the next time my family recommends this, we'll pass.  I'd rather just go to McDonald's.  And, what's the deal with having all the drinks at the cash register?  Why don't you just have a drink dispenser out with the rest of the stuff like Sweet Tomatoes has?"}
{"text":"This place is so gross . I remember going to Golden Corral as a kid with the entire family and it used to be a good quality meal . Now everything seems like it's been sitting for hours , but what's really causing me to give this place a one star review is that I'm very convinced that there is something the restaurant puts in the food to make you feel fuller faster.  I had an upset stomach for hours after I ate here and felt extremely bloated ! I always eat pretty clean , and decided to go here because they have a variety of healthy choices so after feeling the way I do , this will be the last time I go here ! However if you're up for some low quality food and don't care about what you put in your body , this is a great place ;)"}
{"text":"Great breakfast and what I liked about it the most is they had lunch stuff like fried chicken and pot roast and chili and our server was great his name is Joe"}
{"text":"This location was awesome the first few years after it was open.  I'm sad to say, I will not be eating there again.  It was dirty, the food was not as good.  It attracts a seedy clientele and is just not kept up to the good standards it once had.  The barbecue chicken was awful.  I used to love their recipe!!  What happened, GC???  All the while, their prices are way higher.  Save your money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is the best Golden Corral we have ever been to and we have lived and traveled all over the United States. The staff is extremely attentive and friendly and the manager always has a smile on his face. The food is always cooked to perfection and I have to give special attention to the guy that works on the grill and the lady that takes care of the salad bar. They are amazing at what they do. Love Love Love this location. Only thing I wish they offered that they don't is diet Dr. Pepper. Not enough Diet soda options."}
{"text":"I finally tried this place one evening. The line was long. I had high expectations for this place, but sadly was disappointed. The food didn't please my palate. Perhaps I've been spoiled by Asian buffets. Even though we were seated near the chocolate fountain, I didn't dare eat from it. There were just so many people. Just too many people for my comfort and I felt a bit dirty eating there. Both adults and kids are so messy dripping or dropping food on the floor. The staff were quick to clean up any messes. The quality of the food was ok, almost like hometown.  I liked the strawberries because they were very sweet and I ate them by itself. Most of the stuff I tried was ok. Perhaps I would give this place a try again in the future, but at lunch time. Going there for dinner is expensive."}
{"text":"Since there is only one here in Las Vegas, you have to plan ahead to dine here. The lines to dine here are usually long but the food makes it worth while waiting.  The staff that work here are very assertive and friendly.  Server named Irene is a joy to be reckoned with, her killer smile and professionalism makes me want to come back.  I recommend anyone to come dine here, just plan ahead before coming"}
{"text":"It's cheap boring buffet food.  If you are looking for Las Vegas style presentation, you are not going to find it here.  Good deal for breakfast.  I mean how wrong can you go with eggs and potatoes right?  Lunch and dinner is mediocre.  Most of the food they serve are tasteless commercially produced food.  It's like one or two steps above Hometown Buffet.  Save your money and go across the street to Chili's for better food.  Even better idea, just go to Costco down the street and grab few hot dogs and a large pizza for a total bargain."}
{"text":"Like every other one. But this one has a great friendly staff.  That makes you want to come back sit down at the table again and again and again."}
{"text":"DISGUSTING!  After waiting for an hour, we finally arrived near the end of the line where I can grab my strawberry soda. After paying my cheap admission price of ~$12, I was eager to start my dinner with hopes it would be decent given all the hype.   10 minutes later, I ate raw canned corn which were half cooked, a piece of steak that was rock solid when suppose to be medium rare, chow mein which tastes far from even mein, and lukewarm broccoli. It made me really appreciate the other bad buffets I have been too. This is by far the worst buffet I have been to.   The floor was grossly dirty. Pieces of bread and meat lingered all over. Parents were letting their kids roam free, dropping ice cream and strawberries. I even saw a kid pick his booger out before using the same hand to grab a corn on the cob. Needless to say, I lost my hungry appetite FAST.   The salad bar was not any better. The lettuce was not in cold temperature. The dessert section was mediocre with plain peach cobblers. Not worth the drive. Now worth the wait. Not worth the price. Just not worth it at all."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast today. It's a buffet- Some things are excellent, so not so good. Banana Bread french toast =Delish. Took the nephews, everyone gets what they want....Staff were great, Thanks"}
{"text":"This place is a disgrace I can not believe the health inspector has not shut them down for how disgusting this place is. There was food crusted onto the \"clean\" plates and silverware. Food was left on several tables, smashed into the floors, and all over the seats.  The cottage cheese was warm and sour. Do not come here for your on well being. It is not worth your time or money. $18 for this amount is disgust."}
{"text":"Would you believe that after sending the negative review to the location manager as well as corporate not one reply!  Go to Sizzler instead"}
{"text":"Food good, everything hot.Person behind the food buffet lines were pretty nice ,Offered the fresh food when you stood there.  Have not had an offer for a refill since I got here. My daughter has been offered twice. They did not clear or offer to clear the table up for 45 minutes after we sat down. Not typical of this place. They usually are on top of everything.   We always tip pretty well here afraid not this time because literally there is nobody to tip.   Ready to leave no offer of refill. Demoting 1 star.   My wife was here with me today, food cold and very disappointing. Service was ok but they never had the manager come over. All food cold.   Update: Sunday prices shoot up 10 bucks regardless of the time. They go from breakfast right to dinner and the food is the same exact food like the day before. It's like a spike in price just because a day goes by.   Saturday the food seemed fresher (weird) than Sunday.    This place is hot or miss today it is total miss and they don't have buttered noodles. Real hard to make."}
{"text":"Awesome service and very clean for the amount of people. If you leave here hungry, you have a serious issue!!!! The steak is better then outback or Logan's!!!!!"}
{"text":"I went for lunch and overall most of the food was good . The only problem I had was when i ate the tuna fish usually when I eat tuna fish I feel fine but, whatever was in that tuna destroyed my stomach.I will NEVER eat the tuna fish there ever again.People for the sake of your digestive system DO NOT EAT THE TUNA FISH.(especially with crackers)"}
{"text":"Why is there always a line out the door? Because it's about 9 dollars for AYCE lunch...and this is 'merica, so if you're coming here expecting pristine food, go somewhere else. If you want to get full and bloated, come right in.  It's 2 steps up from Hometown Buffet and the Chinese buffets around the area. What I liked is the variety. Salad, Chinese food, BBQ, Mexican, dessert and bread section...I'm missing something...Italian!   I think it was called the bourbon street chicken? Get that.   Poke a bunch of strawberries/marshmallows/whatever on a stick before you lather it in chocolate. People are waiting to get at that chocolate fountain."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how we got here, but wow what a WASTE in calories.  What's interesting is this place has three types of rice (Mexican Rice, Rice Pilaf, and Fried Rice), what's funny is all the rices taste the same and was way too soggy.   Whats even more funny is that the mac and cheese tastes just like the rice. Whats ridiculous is that the green beans have no taste at all. To put it over the top, the meatloaf and salad bar is horrible.   This place looks busy, but really it's just not, it's much smaller in space than Hometown Buffet and the clientele seems to be a lot bigger than Hometown's. I think I saw a good amount of people that are being paid by SDI for being too obese to work.   I'd rather go to hometown and I really hate that place!    I will not visit again.."}
{"text":"I hesitated about a week after coming to write a review on this place to let my thoughts kind of process. In conclusion, I feel my experience here wasn't anything that wow-ed me, to be honest. I heard about this place when it opened, but steered clear for the entire time because I heard horror stories about how atrocious the waits and lines were.  I came here last Sunday for lunch around 11 something and there was a line that snaked outside the door, ending just outside of the shaded covering. The wait continued inside to the registers and I would say in total...the wait was about 45 mins or so.  I had heard raves about how Golden Corral was comparable to a Vegas buffet and how it kicked Hometown Buffet's ass, etc, etc. And I felt that with the crazy lines this place had brought out when it first opened (and still, even a few months in with its opening), that this place had to have some sort of majestic charm.  To be honest though, I felt the fare offered here was alright. Definitely not on the level of a \"Vegas buffet\" as I had heard early on (although there are small things here and there to note). The interior design faintly mimics those of Paris Buffet and maybe even The Spice Market Buffet at Planet Hollywood (you know, with the faux windows, awnings, and separate stations/buildings), but that's probably about it in terms of appearance. Now granted, the food wasn't bad or anything (there are even some small things that make Golden Corral better than Hometown, such as the corn here, which is plump and juicy) - overall the food is by far better than the quality Hometown Buffet serves up, but it's nothing that'll blow you away. However, I do like that there are some special things here, such as the machine cotton candy and coconut macaroons, and also the steaks, which are cooked right in front of you by a team of chefs - all these small things bring that higher-end feel (or \"Vegas feel\") to Golden Corral.  It's hard to say whether I'll be coming back or not. I used to love buffets so much when I was a kid, but I think growing up, I've come to be quite indifferent about them. Even with this review, I feel like something's missing - I'm not disappointed, but I'm not too impressed either.  I just don't know. I guess I'm just not the kind of person who'll want to wait in a long line for food anymore. Again, nothing particularly bad about this place, but again - nothing particularly special."}
{"text":"Came here on the soft opening. It wasn't too crowded. The food was good and there were many option to choose from. Only downside was that people took too long in line for the food. I recommend going here."}
{"text":"Got two plates to go.  It was 2 pm on a Sunday so the place was pretty crowded.  One common theme was that all the popular items were out while I was trying to assemble my plates.  Like chicken strips/nuggets,  meatloaf,  bone in chicken.  Got a steak which was inedible and the fried fish had so many bones it was mostly inedible too.  It was 5.89 a lb so our two plate total clocked in about $25. Not a great value really.  I attached a pic,  you decide."}
{"text":"my family & I were at G.C. for dinner last nite.  super choices for all appetites.  food choices = healthy, fried, salads, soups great!  the desert bar is yummy..  bathrooms remodeled.   staff friendly.   waitresses work hard -- everyone remember to tip them..keeping our glasses full, tables clean.   try it ;  good value for your $"}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to eating here for some time, and was disappointed.  Went for lunch on a Monday at 11am food was descent at best they have a large variety to choose from so i can't complain there. some food was very blan and tasteless. I was most disappointed by the strawberries next to chocolate fountain they were green and sour. and also rice crispys were stuck together, no apples or anything else. Service was great tables were cleaned up quick. i was surprised to learn you have to ask for drink refills but wait staff were on it quickly. As mentioned in another review the people that frequent here, and I must say any buffet place, can really turn off your appetite. Coughing kids running around grabbing their own foods, loud large parties taking up to many tables, food hoarders pilling hefty servings on one plate. Seems like GC is just putting to many people in too small a place.  Probably will not be return here anytime soon screw those tempting commercials"}
{"text":"Golden Corral is a traditional After Church go-to place. Not sure why, though. I guess church folk love the concept of \"All You Can Eat,\" especially when it's only $10 for \"adults\" and $7 for \"seniors.\" Shrugs.  It's pretty close to \"home-cooked food,\" once you've shaken off the fact that you don't actually know who cooked it.  The mac & cheese makes me siiiiiing!! Sooo creamy and soft, pleasing babies and the elderly just as much as those of us with teeth.  The beef stew was pleasant; the beef was tender and well-marinated, but the vegetables somehow lacked flavor. The potato salad was meh (my mom's is way better), as were the green beans. The rolls, however, are the tastiest foodstuff on the planet. No lie. Seriously, if I could come here and get a whole plate of hot rolls without stares, I so would.   For the lazy amongst us (myself included), there's a takeaway buffet option. All you can eat that can fit in a takeaway box for 5 bucks a pound. Solid deal."}
{"text":"Tara, our server was excellent! She was attentive & polite. Made sure we were good with our drinks & asked before taking our plates. The food was a good variety. The only thing, was the wait & a bit crowded. But all in all, we had a good experience for a party of six. Thank you Tara!!"}
{"text":"this place was amazing! STEAK. RIBS. TILAPIA. ICE CREAM. FONDUE. COTTON CANDY. yummy. delish. and more...  the cons though? THE LINE. THE WAIT. so be there when it opens.  service is lovely. the people were really nice. it' more like you have to watch out for other customers. some of them can be rude or they just let their children run a muck everywhere (NOT COOL PARENTS). so just watch out for customer crazies."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in quite some time, mostly cause it became so overcrowded and service was bad at another location. I moved into this area and decided give it a go. So this is my first shot at this location and it wasn't chaotic, they actually kept it pretty clean, service has been excellent, the young man named Paul taking care of this area has been on point! Great employee! The food seemed pretty fresh, hot and all in all good. I'd come back to this location."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a large crowd. We had a private room which was very nice, although the tables needed cleaning. The food was not good!!! the sandwiches were dried out. Most items looked overdone or dry. Many of the people with our group were very disappointed in the food."}
{"text":"we love eating here mostly on a weekend brunch, just love the breakfast variety that u can choose especially the make ur own omelet station is the best and free juices"}
{"text":"Straight trash. My wife and I walked in,got seated, went up to the buffet and everything was combed over,dried out and sticking to the pans. The restaurant was at 1/4 capacity with a full staff. I have been to this location once before and had a similar issue but it was near closing time. This is by far the worst Golden Corral in the area."}
{"text":"The food is pricey but you have lots of options! It's a place we can eat that makes everyone happy & the dessert options are endless! It's my kids favorite but I can only handle it about once a year! They call it the Disneyland of restaurants!"}
{"text":"Pros -great steak like wow! -steak sauce! -cotton candy -chocolate fountain -great selection of salads -seafood with fried shrimp -ice cream -price is good  Cons -chaotic -horrible parking -service is soso"}
{"text":"Finally made it to a Golden Corral... and found out that one of the reasons it's called that is because you're corralled into line just to get in.  Seriously, even though we showed up after 1 pm, we had to wait 30 minutes!  Sheesh!  We paid the lunch price ($8.99, not counting drinks) - if anything, most of the food was worth the wait.  I LOVED the Bourbon Chicken, the Sweet and Sour Pork, and their fried chicken liver and grilled beef liver, as well as the garlic cheese bread.  The dessert bar is also worth checking out - any place that has cotton candy and a chocolate fondue fountain as dessert options has my stamp of approval.  The negative two stars are for the size of the place - it feels very cramped - and for not being able to fill your own drinks.  Then again, the wait staff do a great job checking the tables and refilling your drinks (Chinese buffets, take note).  Overall, with more options than Hometown Buffet, I can see why Golden Corral is quite popular (especially as it appears there aren't many locations in So Cal).  Worth going to again... just maybe not on peak periods."}
{"text":"The line at 8PM on a Friday night was out the door!!! Comparing to Hometown Buffet, I have to say Golden Corral is half a star better.  That's not really saying much though...both buffets are pretty crappy but let's divulge into greater detail here about Golden.   The fried shrimp, onion rings, and fish were pretty decent.  Looking through the batter, the shrimp were actually de-veined! That's pretty awesome for a buffet.  The fried fish was the typical southern type breading much like the one you can find at Boiling Crab.  The fish obviously wasn't as fresh but it tasted good enough with a shower of tartar sauce. AS for the steak, it's not super high quality but it does have a good charred off the grill taste to it.  You can request any sort of temperature depending on the supply on the grill.  I want to say for $12 dinner price, eating just the steak and shrimp is already a bargain.  The same meal at Sizzler's is probably $12+   I also tried some of the ribs, fried chicken, ham and everything was underwhelming.  Most of the these foods tastes typical cafeteria style with a mass produced sense of flavor and texture.  I'm not sure I'd come back or recommend this buffet to any of my REAL friends...hehehe"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the variety of food, quality has gone down.  The kids are the only reason I even entertain Golden Corral they enjoy being able to eat junk food with no limits (except a mommy limit).  I usually like the catfish but I wasn't impressed.  The steak was well done when I asked for medium rare.  The fried chicken blah!  There wasn't a variety of fruits.  I like having a variety for my salads, probably the best thing. Really not much to talk about.  It's a family restaurant as long as kids are happy I'm happy!"}
{"text":"i went on opening day and no wait. so i enjoyed my visit. the food was good and so was the service and the price was decent, just don't get the soda cause that is what gets you. Definitely a lot better than hometown BUT i wouldn't want to wait an hour to eat here, but i think that will die down soon. its just like half and half or 85degrees. now the waits for those establishments are manageable  Will go back once the hype dies down and there aren't 50 people waiting outside to eat everyday"}
{"text":"First of all let me preface this in saying I do not do buffet's like this.  The only reason for our visit was a relative was in town on a bus trip layover having dinner.  My wife and I went to visit.  We had already had dinner so I said to the hostess up front we are not eating, she said you cannot enter.  I asked her if we can just pay for what we consume we were going just have coffee,  and they did not offer this.   From my understanding part of dining is the social aspect.  This was about 8:55 PM, and my 5 year old went to sit down on the bench in the lobby while our relative came out to greet us because we were not going to pay for a buffet we were not going to consume.  The hostess noticed this so when he stood up to give our relative a hug she passive aggressively put a dirty floor mat on the bench where he was sitting. When we questioned her about this behavior, she said this is our policy we always put the mats our at closing.  This was just nasty."}
{"text":"I will never set foot in this establishment again, which is sad because my 4yo loves GC.   After our last visit, on June 7th, I came down with food poisoning. I will spare you the details. Food poisoning is awful and everyone knows that. It really sucks that this happened because I hate eating at buffets inside of smokey casinos. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"My family and I eat at this location on a regular basis.  Wife loves it.  I think it's just OK.  On today's particular occasion, about 5 PM on a Saturday, it was less crowded than usual.  Food was replaced on a regular basis and was reasonably warm.  Waitress was just OK.  What do you want?  Basic buffet food, not really anything special.  Appetizer special was a nice change-up from the usual fare there.  On crowded days like Sunday afternoons, such as the last time we were there, when parties departing church in the city come for early Sunday dinner, the service is inconsistent.  Food is colder and more slowly replaced.  A waitress who has waited on us a number of times there, however, was golden and very attentive.  She was well worth a 25% tip, which I gave her the last time I saw her.  To conclude....basic, decent food that needs to be a little warmer, and inconsistent service, especially during Sunday rush or on holidays.  Avoid this place on Sunday and you'll do OK."}
{"text":"We'd been wanting to stop at a Gold Corral.  It had been years since we had eaten at one.  So, we went at lunch.  The food was good.  There was a lot of it and it was fresh.  There was also a good variety and the fresh food just kept coming.  Turnover was quick so nothing stale on the line.  The place was packed.  There are servers but ours really didn't serve us anything.  Plates set on the table until close to the time we left.  Normally we even tip good at buffets but didn't see a reason to leave one when we weren't even served a refill on our drinks."}
{"text":"Strangely, I don't think that I had been to a Golden Corral for years.  Then in the last three weeks, I've been multiple times.  I don't know why.  To make it even more interesting, I actually ate more at the salad bar than I did at the meat/entree bar.  Go figure.  The salads are actually pretty decent.  I'm not an expert by any means, but I really enjoyed the variety of selection when it came to lettuce, as well as toppings for the salads and even the various soups they had.  Don't get me wrong, I went back and picked up a few sides here and there to go with it (don't want to spend my $10 and eat a salad), but I didn't gorge myself on all you can eat ribs either.  Sweet Tea Report:  The sweet tea in the front (where you pay your bill) is almost always excellent.  But the sweet tea in the back - where the servers get your refills - is almost always not sweet.  So ask your server to get your refills from the front and you'll be good.  Otherwise it's horribly not sweet."}
{"text":"The line was out the door and off the curb, but it was not too bad of a wait. I went at 12 on Sunday, ppl were always leaving so the line was moving pretty quickly (30 mins).  The service was good although our server thought we left and cleared our drinks and all our plates.  Our new server just brought us new drinks. They cleared our tables often :).  The food was delish, esp the shrimp and fish that was pan fried! I went back for more, 4 times! Very good fresh fruits, watermelon was so sweet!  You are able to see the chefs cook / prep the buffet food through the glass windows which was cool and a first. Everyone was wearing gloves, so pretty clean right?   I would def go back again! I got cotton candy to go too! :)"}
{"text":"I have never been talked to or treated this bad at a restaurant before in my life I brought my family to eat after church and Jeff the general manager that would not give his last name was so rude and do confrontational he would not ring our party up until my senior citizen mom got into the building is will never bring my family to eat here again"}
{"text":"Update: I had hoped to speak to corporate about my horrible first visit, and even sent them two messages via their messaging service on their website. Sadly, they have never responded to me nor have they even tried to contact me and find out what happened, unlike other restaurants. So pretty much, this place sucks in both customer service and quality. Take your money somewhere else, and don't bother coming to this place. Go somewhere else where they treat customers like people."}
{"text":"Horrible experience!! Will not go back to again!! All dishes and utensils were dirty. Staff were idiots. Food is as good as expected with the price. Very unorganized when it comes to having you sat"}
{"text":"There's always a line here because the place is worth it. I came her for dinner, waited about 1/2 hour to be seated. Cost about $14 bucks a person if you want a drink.  Their variety of food is good, with the dessert bar being the best. Also the waiters refill your drinks which is good. Will come here again.   Not 5 starts because they don't really organize the lines of people coming in. Also there was a wait for some of my favorite items."}
{"text":"This was a good place to come. But for the last 6 times I've come there is a gentleman by the name of ZAUL . He truly makes me feel uncomfortable due to his faces and fucked up attitude when it comes to serving steak. Golden Corral really needs to replace him with someone who loves there job. The Golden Corral on 59th Ave and northern those guys are excited to serve you steak. I probably won't be back. I'd rather drive 15 miles out of my way to get excellent service at 59th Ave and northern"}
{"text":"Very bad.  We couldn't deside which was worse....the food or the company...both low quality.  This is an example of where buffets get there bad name."}
{"text":"I came in here and the place was clean. Probably the cleanest Golden Corral I've been to. It was around 15$ per person. The food was alright, some food was good and some other food was bland and cold. The steak was the thing that surprised me. It was cook well, not dry or anything. It was juicy and well seasoned. The steamed vegetables decent. The chicken looked awful. It looked like it was sitting there for days. It was super dry and looked burned. The deserts were pretty good. The carrot cake and apple pie were great. The brownies were not as good but the cookies were really tasty, warm and soft. The pizza look amazing but never judge a book by its cover, it didn't taste as good as it looked. It wasn't bad but it wasn't good. Overall I think this place is pretty good if you are just passing by and don't know where else to go."}
{"text":"This location continues to go further and further down the proverbial hill, had dinner there with my family after self-boycotting the place several months ago and remembered why I don't eat there anymore.   Right after walking in I peek at the Steak grill and as usual there is nothing cooking and what's there resembles a hockey puck! These guys are getting what amounts to probably the worst cuts of meat on the planet, full of grizzle, never cooked to anything other than well done or still moo'ing and for what amounts to the item that is the main reason people come into the chain, they make it the reason not to! I even asked the cook when he's putting down more meat and he said soon, the 3 pieces he had left were lumps of coal and the restaurant was filling up, might be a clue to start cooking sport!   The place just generally looks unclean, there is plenty of staff but it's unclear as to what they're doing, no bowls for ice cream hell actually no ice cream, the vanilla was not working and nobody was doing anything about it, not even putting a sign on it that said out of service that would be helpful right! One of my favorites to use to camouflage the poor taste of the bad steaks are the sauteed mushrooms, well there were none the entire time we were there, it just sat empty and what's funny is the steak cook has a clear view of that and could or should do something about it.    I think that what broke the camels back this trip is that residents from what appeared to be from a local group home had come in for dinner, nothing wrong with that but they were a little scary and off-putting, smelled bad, had service dogs and the manager might have wanted to use the party room, called it a VIP area and had them eat in there, instead they were front and center taking up a chuck of the right dining room after you walk in which means that everyone got a glimpse of them as soon as they paid for their plates since the human eyes naturally goes to the right, really not good judgement on the part of management for the sake of the other guests.    Bottom line, the last 3 visits were all bad, I'm a 3 strikes and you're out kinda guy, they will never see me again."}
{"text":"-PARKING: plenty  -DECOR: what is with the BRIGHT fluorescent lights during dinner? Most places have softer lighting during dinner. Plus, it smelled like dirty carpets and felt like some kind of church hall meeting with the strange lighting.  -RESTROOM: Smelled like sewage and needed to be cleaned, like someone just had a toilet paper party in the ladies restroom.  -SERVICE: all of the employees that I encountered were friendly.  -PRICE: Not too bad for dinner, like $10 bucks and change.  -FOOD: Pretty good. The Chinese was not good, but all of the American \"comfort\" foods were pretty tasty. Decent selection.  -BEVERAGE: They give you your beverage when you pay and the waitress gives you refills. No access to coffee or your own refills. Reminds me of the Vegas buffets where you are at the mercy of the Food Server for refills.  ****Four Stars for good food and friendly service."}
{"text":"Well I must say I was pleasantly surprised first by the charge of $2.49 for my beverage and then by the food quality. Vegas is full of Buffets and this will hold its own with 70% of the Casino buffets"}
{"text":"Me and my family have been coming to Golden Corral, in many different locations and states, for many years.  For the most part, our experiences have been fairly decent; which is why we keep coming back.  This time around was mostly the same, as far as the food goes. The tater tots looked like they had been fried 3 minutes longer than  recommended, and were pretty much just a crispy shell, with all of the potato fried away on the inside.  I DID like the  new garlic knot muffins. ( New to me, anyway)  I am still saddened with the changed bread pudding. Not sure how long ago GC changed the recipe, but its NOT what it used to be.  Everything else I had was same-ole-same. Pot roast was good.  The only problem was something that happened to my wife.  As we walked to the booth my daughter had spotted, she was arrying our sons diaper bag and wifes purse..i was carrying the tray with all the drinks and untensils, and my wife was carrying out 20 month old son. As me and daughter make our way to the booth, my wife, unknown to us, broke off and went to grab a high chair. Once me and daughter get situated, I look back for my wife, and see her coming across the little room, dragging the highchair, still managing to hold onto our squirming son. She seemed quite unhappy. I found out that she lost a good grip on the highchair while walking in the main area. THREE GC employees walked past her without hardly a second glance by the time I met her halfway to grab the highchair.  Pathetic.   Im sure there is no policy within any of GC's employee conduct papers that state it is imperative that employees render assistance to customers, should it appear they need it.  But common sense and basic courtesy should be."}
{"text":"Compared to other Golden Corral this one was pretty bad.  It was extremely crowded, the food wasn't as appetizing.  The patron there was disgustingly obese, smelly, loud, packed with kids running around.  It was difficult just to walk to get food with everyone in the way.  The place is definitely wayyyy to small to accommodate the amount of people.  Also because the place is so crowded the drinks doesn't get refilled.  I came on a weekday and I can't imagine during a weekend."}
{"text":"The services are great! The food options are great! The price is not bad for buffet $10 average and you got it all!  The pizza tasted not good. Pasta sauce flavor is just ok. It tasted just like plain tomatoes."}
{"text":"Not worth the wait... Service is poor and the food tastes more like cafeteria food. Even though it is a buffet and grill, it is nearly impossible to eat a good piece of steak since there is a huge line for that as well. Oh, one more thing, the place is a mess specially by the food. I went towards the mens restroom and couldnt even go in.. Since my visit last week my family and I have been at Hometown Buffet twice now, and we were soo glad we did.. The service is absolutely wonderful and the food  is great. We will definitely be sticking with Hometown, I wont recomend golden corral to any of my friends. Its just not worth the wait..."}
{"text":"Easily my favorite place in all of Surprise . Only problem is I over eat, I can't go too often. The selection of food is amazing beats any buffet I know of. Last trip, on my birthday, I enjoyed the salads, steak, and ribs of beef. Also had room for a slice of pie and some ice-milk. When you pass by a restaurant and see its parking lot full, that's the place to stop at.  I'm never disappointed."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place since its close by. I categorized this place as my 'will try once\" food place. I really want to like it because of their selection. Sadly i am not returning as a customer.   - long wait, disorganized - food was blah, only good food was texas toast!  - not a lot of seafood selection"}
{"text":"We are from Palm Springs where we don't have Golden Corral. We thought it would be fun to see what this place was all about. Our server was named Rachel and she was EXCELLENT! She kept our drinks refilled, plates cleared, and was so sweet! And the biggest shocker was how awesome the steak was! I never expected a decent steak from a buffet, but the gentleman who cooked our steaks did an awesome job! We are so glad we came here!!! This was a very pleasant experience all the way around!"}
{"text":"My husband and I like to go here when we don't know what else to eat. There's a variety of foods that are decent. The price is right. Around $13 per person. You can make fresh salads, eat steak cooked to your liking, and dip fresh covered strawberries in a chocolate fountain. Food isn't \"WOW\" but like I said, it's decent and the price is right."}
{"text":"paid $30 for lunch for my daughter and I.  Big rip off. For that price I could have gotten a better meal almost anywhere.  The food was disgusting. We barley ate more than 5 bites.  I could not eat the meat.  It was tough.  The side dishes looked they were just something they pull out of a can.  The entrance smelled like urine.  I felt like I was in the walmart of buffet restaurants. I ended up with stomach cramps just from eating stuffing and mashed potatoes."}
{"text":"My server was Evan who was very prompt to accommodate mine and my guests needs.  The manager at this Golden Corral (not sure of his name) consistently goes out of his way to make sure that it is an enjoyable experience for the patrons.  He makes sure silverware is filled, food items are being rotated, and stops and says hello to the customers.  All of the servers were very polite and the cook staff was very attentive and friendly.  The food is good and some aspects make this Golden Corral GREAT which is why I would like to commend them.    There was a great selection of menu items: the rolls were pipping hot, the steak was tasty, great selection of veggies at the salad bar and for the hot items (I really enjoyed the brussel sprouts and carrots - yum), the macaronni and cheese was very tasty, and our server went the extra mile to deliver a plate of rotisserie chicken to our table as soon as it was put out.  They do try to monitor the cleanliness at this location and work as fast as they can to bust tables.  Some visits the food is better than others but I always have very tasty, nicely prepared food items to choose from when I go.  The soft serve (especially with fruit), carrot cake, and chocolate cake are REALLY good.  The roast beef with root vegetables (red skin potatoes, carrots, celery, and onions) is also a good go to menu item.    Hands down I can see the care that goes into preparing the items and creating a positive experience at the Monroeville location.  Kudos to the manager, he does an outstanding job and is very sensitive to the needs of the patrons and supportive to his employees.  I am quite impressed with their business demeanor at this Monroeville location (I only go in the evenings or late afternoon).  I do prefer this one to the Golden Corral in Robinson Twp.    The price for the dinner buffet $10.69 per person plus tax and tips.  Soft drinks cost extra.  I was feeling down today but I can always count on that manager being cheerful and the glow of his personality is really duplicated by the staff.  Much thanks...    11/11/12 I went back for brunch.  I wish some of these breakfast/brunch items were on the lunch menu.  The bacon was perfectly cooked (some of the best bacon I have ever eaten), the juice bar (guava, orange, cranberry, and apple) really add alot to the meal experience, the biscuits were sky high, the sliced potatoes (home fries) were excellent, but my favorite were those warm glazed star doughnuts.  The managers and wait staff once again were very attentive at wiping down the tables the selections were plentiful for a brunch outing.  I was glad that they had macaroni and cheese because that just really hit the spot."}
{"text":"We waited quite some time to go check things out but have been to other locations in California, Arizona and Oklahoma.  Food was great just so damned busy!  Our waiter, Big T, was wonderful considering the huge crowd.  We never went without drinks, napkins or having plates cleared up.  Would love to see another location in my part of town ASAP."}
{"text":"People are super nice.  But I have to wait on my drinks alot. .. I find my self refilling my own drink all the way in the front... The food is pretty good for the price.. good family place"}
{"text":"Excellent servers & clean, friendly atmosphere. Kalu our server was outstanding, you need 10 guys like him at every location. I have three little boys under 5 which makes eating out a bit of a chore, but this Golden Corral makes it easy. Well done!"}

{"text":"I like it here. Good food. Near hwy 60 something to eat before heading to Las Vegas Nice selection."}
{"text":"i love the juicy steak! It had the smoky flavor. My parents brought me their and i started with a piece of steak, some pan seared shrimp, and some fried chicken. the chicken soup located at the salad bar was a little too salty, but still tastes good. i spotted this awesome chocolate fountain. i dipped some marshmallows in it and...OMG! it's great!"}
{"text":"This place advertises in  Vegas all the time but they don't have any here. We were visiting some friends in Chandler, AZ and thought we would try it.  First impressions, it was very busy. There was a long line to get in. No wonder,  the bill for 4 adults and our brood of 4 was $74,that's pretty cheap eats.  All the brood kept talking about was this chocolate fountain they call a \"wonderfall\". This was my bargaining chip to make them finish their plates!  The food quality was actually pretty good. I honestly didn't expect it to be that good. They had a carving station and were slicing up some steak. It was good. I wasn't blown away but hey, don't expect the best steak you ever had here.   I will admit, I ate too much, I tried to stick to my diet,  but the willpower went out the window when I saw my favorite fried foods; shrimp, clams and calamari. They were all perfectly cooked and delish.  The GF was happy with her vegetarian selections.   The other adults were happy with the offerings too.  The children were in heaven. They had pizza, pasta, fried chicken, mac and cheese, all the usual crowd pleasers for kids.  Now onto dessert. They had this chocolate fountain surrounded by children, waiting to dive in head first. Platters of marshmallows, rice krispy treats, strawberries, cookies, brownies. These are a few of their favorite things.......In the end, all the kid's faces were covered with chocolate and they were smiling and giggling.  Priceless......  They also had cotton candy. I learned that this was my GF's weakness. She came walking with this cotton candy like a little kid. Once she had her first bite, this smile came over. I think she had a foodgasm right there at the table!  One standout for dessert was the banana bread pudding, it was frigging amazing.  A lady in line told me it was as good as her Mom's and I believe her now.  Our server was great. She kept on smiling, refilling our beverages, clearing the huge piles of plates and never missing a beat. I know her job must get difficult at times and we appreciated her service and told her and showed her.  One more thing I must add. The GF and myself love to people watch and this place ranked 9 out of 10.  If you have ever seen the website called \"\". It was as if the the people of Walmart website and a restaurant had a lovechild. I saw some seriously atrocious ensembles. Its like they went to Walmart first and went straight to Golden Corral.  We were thoroughly entertained and filled up."}
{"text":"We have been visiting this Golden Corral for at least the last seven years and love it. Sure it gets crazy - like any buffet! - at night and on the weekends with people all over and food running out briefly, so we go during the day for lunch or for a late lunch on the weekends. We adore Shirley, the most fantastic waitress ever. And the manager, Ben, is very helpful and friendly. Even if you're not a big buffet fan, give it a try - the desserts alone make it worthwhile!"}
{"text":"There's a ton of options, because of that each dish is probably not at the best level it could be at. Some greasy meat and overcooked veggies but there is definitely something for everyone and there are some great quality dishes. You get what you pay for, pretty average place, good for kids."}
{"text":"NEEDS TO BE SHUT DOWN, as not only that they token from me the able to think any GC is okay, not I look at GC and say nope, not a one.   https://www.instagram.com/explore/locations/19014227/  https://www.instagram.com/p/BFLSA2mTRJs/?tagged=vstorewtfe https://www.instagram.com/p/BFLRu9bzRJU/?tagged=vstorewtfe https://www.instagram.com/p/BFLRijsTRJC/?tagged=vstorewtfe https://www.instagram.com/p/BFLRJu_zRId/?tagged=vstorewtfe https://www.instagram.com/p/BFLPpDZTRGi/?tagged=vstorewtfe https://www.instagram.com/p/BFLO9LdzRFX/?tagged=vstorewtfe https://www.instagram.com/p/BFK6mfKzROV/?tagged=vstorewtfe https://www.instagram.com/p/BFK7KMiTRPp/?tagged=vstorewtfe  The worst, they had box and trash just piling over each other, the whole party got sick, they don't clean or cook their food all the way and will let the Salad get room temperature and that is the worst tasting; they have food that is just all over the parking lot and have a shovel to shovel it back in, for this is not a place that you want to go and live after.  Get ready to stand in a long line, as I went their on mothers day and found that they have no CS skills, or know how to cook anything, or clean anything; when you point of that they could do better to the manager, you will be followed and they will recant any part I'm doing a bad job and on top of it the Regional manager  or the director,  what ever they call it, knows about how bad the food it and will say that they do and that they will not return any of your calls and when they say they are going to give you coupons, they will just say that.  This is the worst place I have ever eaten at or will ever hope to eat at.  For they have dust over, that is caked, they have pee\"cake"}
{"text":"Somewhat regretful that I checked in here. Saw the commercials on the boob tube and agreed  to eat here with some extended family. Other reviewers were ACCURATE in describing this place to be like Hometown, but with a meat grill. IMO, the lines here aren't as bad, as some Yelpers complain, with the exception of the line to actually get into the place. The setup of the place makes it crazy and claustrophobic - a potential goat f*ck during a major dining rush.  Service is attentive and frequent. We got seated around 8pm and left after an hour.     The \"ice cream\" is one of those soft serve machines. The kids like the cotton candy station and the chocolate fountain.  If you want steak, go to store, buy meat, and cook it at home or go to a steakhouse.    This place focuses on volume first, followed by service and cleanliness, and then quality.  If Las Vegas buffets are in the 2 star (nasto) to 4.5 star range (da bomb), this is a three (meh)."}
{"text":"I didn't like it.   Now I know going to an \"all you can eat\" buffet isn't always going to have the best food, but what I tried didn't even tickle my taste buds once! I was let down by the overall taste of the food.  The only reason that I am giving them two stars is because our waiter was friendly, filled out waters, and cleared our plates frequently."}
{"text":"There really isn't anything golden about Golden Corral.  Did I seriously just write that? God I'm lame.  Anyway, this place feels like it's trying to be like a Vegas buffet without the glitz, the glamour and the drive to Vegas. Unfortunately, GC has also left a bit of the flavour and taste behind in Vegas too.   I really shouldn't knock this place too much though. The food is fairly decent and some of it can actually taste kind of good (rice pilaf). Some of the other stuff is kind of under cooked (the bbq chicken).  There's almost a smorgasbord of food-- almost that is..   There's the usual mexicanish station, the asianish station, the italianish station and the actual salad bar that always remains empty.  There is also a chocolate 'wonderfall' and desserts that are too dry to eat.   I feel like I'm being harsh, but in the end, I did give the place 3 stars-- It really wasn't THAT bad.   Oh, well, I almost forgot to mention the crowds. This place is jam packed beyond capacity it feels. There's tons of people running around trying to stuff their faces with fried whatevers and cake. At least in Vegas you have people who can somewhat afford to drive out and go on a vaycay where they aren't so terribly rude. But over here, you are swarmed with people who just want to eat and if you don't get out of their way, they will eat you. Seriously.  Other than that, the server we had was sweating bullets from running around and trying to clean things up, refill people's drinks and do whatever else he could possibly do. Poor guy. He deserves a raise!  I think his name was Chase. Anyway, he worked his bootay off running from table to table and did his best at handling who knows how many tables. His service alone would make me bump this place to 3.5 stars/5 maybe even 4.   Overall, this place.. I mean.... if you really want to experience it, I say go for it. But don't expect a spacious dining experience where the food is outstanding and the chairs are comfy. Expect to be dodging people everywhere you go (except the salad bar, no one is there so hooray!) and decent tasting food in hard uncomforable chairs."}
{"text":"Great rolls, then it is downhill. I actually went for vegetables and all were horrible. The roast beef was 2 star as was the pinto beans but all else was not worth the admission. Live and learn."}
{"text":"The Worst i ever been to in life, I seen flies everywhere and they staff was overwhelmed and seem to have no management from the manager on duty. Barely any food present and the overall experience was no good,  dirty tables and mess everywhere. Disgusted"}
{"text":"Pretty decent place. Was 40 bucks for 3 people. Definitely left feeling full! Would not go out of my way to go all the way over there, but if in the area, I'd go by!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try & check it out, considering the long lines. Don't think it was worth it, and pretty sure I wouldn't go again. Doesn't live up to the hype."}
{"text":"Finally  I got to try this buffet... after the super long waiting line. What they did very smart is that they displayed the soda self-served machine right before the cashier... and most people simply got sucker by taking a soda drink and ended up paying for it even you don't want a soda.... Soda is extra... haha  But... the wait for a $8 lunch buffet is not worth as the foods were a bit better than HomeTown buffet, but not impressive... ok... what to be impressive... only the price which is super cheap... yes... we're cheap once in a while!!"}
{"text":"If I could give it one star I would. The service was horrible,  they were out of food and desserts. It was dirty. Very sad situation."}
{"text":"This place rocks when i moved out to AZ we found this place and it was great. This buffet had it all steaks cooked the way you like them and all the sides are great went for breakfast once and that was also great when i go back to AZ i will be stopping by"}
{"text":"Total filth and disgusting. Where is the Health Department? The \"cleaning solution\" they were spraying (I'm not sure sure what they were cleaning because the place is a $hithole) smelled like cat urine. We paid $35 and left hungry because the food was terrible, dry, under or over cooked, just GROSS. I had to take my young daughter into the restroom and it was even worse. The stall doors were either kicked in, peeling off the hinges, or didn't close. The sinks and soap dispensers were dirty covered in chocolate sauce and probably not cleaned in weeks. Where is there a manager? This place is absolutely unacceptable especially for the high prices. Paint chipping off walls, worn out furniture, disgusting filthy food messes at the buffet and on the floors. waitress(es) who couldn't remember a drink even though we were her only table. I would like my money back or at the very least get the Health dept to close the place down."}
{"text":"Be prepared for the millions of people who act like they haven't seen food in their entire lives! Other than the Sunday lunch rush I liked the food very much. Plus you get to go home with a bag of free rolls which are delicious with butter and heated up! :) Our server was very pleasant and cleared our table when needed as well as refilled our drinks upon request. The only other problem I have is the cashier in the front who talked to us like we were five. I can clearly read \"red cups are for water\" just fine. She explained that to us like we couldn't understand English or something. Well, maybe you should put a bigger sign propped up some place rather than have a little not post it size note on the table where the soda machine sits. People might see it better...just saying."}
{"text":"Big selection of all types of food. Pretty good overall. Hard to eat at buffets without over-eating though. The price is a bit high."}
{"text":"Let's get this straight, it's a buffet.  You don't expect 5 star food at a buffet.  If you have been to any buffet, chances are there will be a line, this place is no exception.  You do want decent food though at the very least, which means roughly 3 stars.  The price point, the quality/freshness, and some items, namely the steak, make the place a good deal at about $12 for dinner.  Off the top of my head and what I could remember they had fried chicken, mash potatoes and gravy, some kind of sesame seed carrots, green beans, pepperoni and cheese pizza, french friess, meat balls in marinara, spaghetti, fresh grilled sirloin steak, carved turkey, carved ham, bbq chicken, quesadilla, refried beans, guacamole, butterflied fried shrimp, fried shrimp, rice, fried rice, egg rolls, jalepeno muffin, corn bread, dinner rolls, sweet sticky buns, potato salad, pasta salad, salad bar whatever that entails, chocolate fondue, pies, a cake, cotton candy, soft serve ice cream, and regular scooped ice cream which I think was rite aid/thrifty's brand.  So again, for $12 dinner, it's a good variety that will get you full.  With so many people eating here, the food is constantly fresh.  The sirloin steak is where it's at if you want to get your monies worth.  Topping the meal off with cookies 'n' cream ice cream makes this place a-ok in my book."}
{"text":"It's all about steak and pork rib.  For $11 it's a steal.  Excluding the line (for weekend, it is about 40 to 60 min. wait), why would anyone go to Sizzler?  Warning: I heard that not all Golden Corrals are the same.   Since this branch is less than a year old, it may be better than other branches.  The best time to go is 8:40 p.m. for dinner."}
{"text":"Decided to try it out, Havnt been to a buffet in years.  Nice selection for dinner, food was good! Dessert selection was good too, cakes, cookies, ice cream and a chocolate fountain   Waitresses were very good, quick to clean up and refill drinks.  The bathrooms were disgusting tho, but I wasn't expecting much."}
{"text":"Food and staff are absolutely awesome! The desert isn't that great, but the good is fresh and the restaraunt is clean."}
{"text":"WoW can you say low quality food! The kids keep making me come do to chocolate fountain and cotton candy! I recommend you buy both machines and never come here ! To expensive for what they offer! Service was very good to bad food nasty!"}
{"text":"Well every now and then I need to make a bad review, and this is one of those times. I love Golden Corral dont get me wrong. But this one is a stay away from.     We visited this location on a Saturday around 6pm. Normally I know its dinner time and its going to be a bit busy I can deal with that. But this place needs to do get their act together.     The management/owners really need to get a clue on how to run a business. I saw more shirts just standing around and being useless then I have ever seen. The older lady who I presume is an owner just runs in circles. Her staff has no guidance at all. Tables full of trash floors dirty and people having to get up and get their own drinks, as no one is doing anything. the place is somewhat busy but one or 2 people doing anything. I can not tell you how many times someone walked by us and didnt even take our trays. but would look right at them.      Took for ever to get drinks refilled, and again the managers just standing around trying to hold up the building or something. Or off chatting with people instead of getting the staff to get the jobs done.. The only people working seemed to be the cashier and the cooks.      This place was a pit. if had not already paid I would have left. i'm very reluctant to ever go back."}
{"text":"The service was really good especially for a buffet... BUT me and my friend couldn't even get through one plate of food because everything was SO salty! I would have felt better about spending the $20 here if I didn't have to spend more money after to eat again somewhere else."}
{"text":"This place is way better than Hometown Buffet. Prepared to wait over an hour during peak times. The steak is moist and flavorful. If you want to go to a super buffet, you'll probably have to drive all the way to vegas."}
{"text":"This is one restaurant where its popularity makes the dining experience hectic and frustrating despite the great food.  Before this one opened last month (April 20, 2012), I went to the one located in Hesperia, CA, 65 miles away from me. It was just as hectic during dinnertime because it was the only one located in the central part of Southern California, so consequently, everyone from LA had to travel there to eat. Now that the Industry restaurant opened, all the LA customers now go there instead of Hesperia, giving that restaurant a little more breathing room. With the Industry location now being the only LA County one, it is naturally going to be crowded until they build more locations. People need to be aware of this and plan their time accordingly... best time to go is around 11am, and around 4 PM, before the crowds really show up. Forget it if you go there at dinnertime on the weekends. You could conceivably wait over an hour to get in. The line outside gets quite long.  The design of the interior is the same for all of the Golden Corrals. Various stations include salads, soups, Asian, Latin, Grillhouse, Italian, Breads, and Desserts. The BIGGEST problem that Golden Corral needs to address is its Grillhouse. The line waiting for the grilled meats can get quite long and the people block access to the Italian section and desserts. I think they should reverse the direction of the waiting line and place them in a roped off stantioned area to give people access to the rest of the food while the people in line get their steaks and fish.  The food itself is tasty and tastes the same as other Golden Corrals which is what makes people come back.... you get the expectation of the good food and in that regard, you are not disappointed.  Ironically, the general manager of this location is Robert Sheldon, former GM of the nearby Hometown Buffet when the food USED to be good. After Mr. Sheldon left to go work for Golden Corral, the HTB food has been steadily going downhill and I personally feel that this GC will be the death knell for the Industry HTB.  EDIT:  My prediction came true... Hometown Buffet closed... In its place is now an Asian Hot Pot style restaurant."}
{"text":"In my 20+ years of restaurant trotting, never once have I walked out of a restaurant in the middle, or beginning of my meal for that matter. Now don't get me wrong, I love the buffets whether it is that of the Old Country or of the  Home Town styling but this dining establishment has seriously bruised my pallet and psyche.     Perhaps it was the time of day, which was on a Sunday afternoon (Yes, I know, a buffet on a Sunday afternoon is packed with enough of the elderly to star as extras in the next George A. Romero film) or maybe it was the fact that I just wasn't feeling buffet steak, but either way I was horribly disappointed with this place.      After standing in line with children screaming and yelling (Some in many different languages) for about half an hour we then arrived at the register where we then had to wait to be seated. I thought that was a cool idea until that wait turned into another 10 minutes, still holding up a tray while dodging children running and/or tumbling about. Again I let the waiting slip by since it was a Sunday afternoon.     After about what seemed like I could have accomplished the Kessel Run in about 12 parsecs we were then seated. If you are not the size of one of the Olsen twins, navigating though the maze of tables could present some challenges.      After we were then seated I had then conjured up quite an appetite. As my lady friend and I approached the actual buffet I again had to run though a gauntlet made up of more screaming children and confused elders. At that point I kept thinking \"Where the Hell are the parents?\" Now most buffets have a sign that clearly states \"Parents: Please accompany your children to the buffet area!\" In a bold and menacing font. Parents, if you're not into accompanying your screaming and sticky children to the designated buffet area, then The Golden Corral is for you!    After dining on fish, shrimp and what seemed like chicken (there are not labels marking all the food) I came to the conclusion that I truly disliked this place. I am not exactly a fish guy, but that was all that had been left. (I had noticed Golden Corral had not once restocked the food while I was in line waiting) Also after discovering a bone in the skin (yes, a bone embedded in the skin!) of my chicken I had to leave.      Now I will say that their rolls they bring to you at the table were very tasty but alas, Golden Corral I will not be back to dine on your misfit chicken nor to try and go though a maze of screaming children to get to my table."}
{"text":"Dont get me wrong love love love golden corral straight jazzed about them but this ones food was terrible. 1st golden corral i didnt go back for 2nds round at. On the other hand besides it being old peoples nesting den the service was awesome super friendly and on point."}
{"text":"Two for $20 Mon to Thurs. You can't beat steak and shrimp for $10 per person. There is a huge selection of food and its freshly made because they are so busy that they can't stop making it. Food is best hot and fresh and that is what you get. This is one place where you get the most bang for your buck. Line is a little crazy. Had to wait 45 mins to get in. But will go back again."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch the other day and it was actually pretty tasty. My diet is limited, so I didnt  get to try a whole lot. I had chicken, veggies, salad and a little bit of pot roast. Everything I had was very good! I was surprised! My server was Chris and he always kept my iced tea filled. He even gave me a free cup of coffee!   There's lots of options at Golden Corral.  Both fattening and healthy.  Get there early. When we were leaving people were coming in by the masses."}
{"text":"The Good:  Food is decent Variety is certainly there Specials are awesome Did I mention Dessert?  The Not so great: Location - I wish there was one closer. Always packed Not the cleanest although they have fixed that more and more as of late.  This is one of my sons favorite places to go (could be because he eats like a moose).  Not a Vegas buffet but one of the best in Phoenix as far as buffets go."}
{"text":"For what it is, this place can't be beat.  No, not every item at this buffet represents top-quality grub, but the steaks are real nice and you can eat as many as you can get and not pay a penny over the entry price.  Beats Sizzler like crazy.  Even beats Black Angus for overall steak taste.  I'm not too big on the homemade potato chips or the breaded bacon, but that's the good thing about Golden Corral--if you don't like something, don't eat it!  There's a ton of other things that you WILL like.  Breakfast, lunch, or dinner, you will always leave stuffed and happy.  Vegetarian?  They can do that.  Want food to go?  They can do that too.  It's loud, always crowded, the servers always have a smile, and it has acres of  food from opening salads and soups down to cakes, pies and a chocolate fountain.  Great place to take your family for a full belly, lots of fun, and not a lot of $$$.  With the closing of places like Bishop's and Luby's, this place represents one of the last places of its kind--but I don't think it will be closing down anytime soon.  it's too popular, and too good!"}
{"text":"I don't know why, but there is nearly always a line out the door and wrapped around the poles inside like a Disneyland ride for this place. It has a wide variety of food that everyone is bound to find something they like from a salad for appetizer to ice cream cones and a chocolate fountain for dessert. For a buffet, they actually have some pretty tasty main dishes and sides. Overall, I liked it, but would I wait an hour in line for it again? Most likely not."}
{"text":"Worst Golden Corral ever! I have been to many Golden Corrals in my travels have never been to an horrible restaurant such as this.   Food wasn't the best! Flies were in the restaurant. Lots of dirty plant mixed in with clean ones. Everyone was sick after of visit. The one in Victorville was awesome but, this one sucked ass!"}
{"text":"I took my family here because we loved the food at the Golden Corrals in California and we were happy they opened one here. Overall the food was great for the price and the service was good. Everything I had was very tasty, only the Salad bar left a lot to be desired. The only complaint is not about the restaurant itself but another couple that sat by us who seemed to be mad at all of kids that were there. Free advice...If you do not like restaurants with an family atmosphere don't go here."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this place before in Florida. I have heard some mixed reviews about Golden corral in general but since it opened up in Vegas I wanted to give it a try.  Within about half an hour of eating this food I got extremely nauseous I was sick for three hours- my stomach is not that sensitive either they don't clean their stuff or they don't use the correct ingredients . this place was 0K as far as service you have to find your own seat which I understand. The people behind the counter there was a guy that look like he was working hard but was sweating all over the food and then spraying water which got me I don't think they realize what they're doing back there it just didn't seem very organized my son also got sick I will not be going back here again"}
{"text":"Food is decent, customer service is a hit and miss, and the overall cleanliness could use some improvement. (Highchairs, counter space, etc)  Let me start with one of the cooks near the meat section, who very loudly, told me to \"Hurry up there's other people here.\"  However, the young man who was serving the very west side of the building (near the bathrooms) on July 5th, around 6:30ish did an EXCELLENT job. I couldn't even take off a star due to the rude kitchen attendant, because the rest of the service was just awesome. If he wasn't cleaning the tables around us, he was getting us or someone else a refill. He was extremely polite, super efficient, and very attentive.  We enjoyed the chocolate fountain in the dessert section. That's not something you find at a buffet."}
{"text":"This is my second time here. The first time I had it was in North Carolina. This Golden Corral has a very long wait time with a huge line out the door. The wait can be up to two hours. The food is pretty good in terms of quality. Not everything is good but a majority of it is. Their seafood is cooked to order although too much butter is used in the sauce. Their steaks are grilled to order too so you can get either medium rare all the way to well done. The food is very fresh. The desserts are high quality too and there is a good diversity to them. The price is not bad for dinner at $11.49 (not including drinks) for so much food diversity. Definitely want to come back."}
{"text":"$34. For 3 adults with drinks. Got in at 11am on a Friday no lines. Bathroom was clean and staff was attentive, friendly and professional. A few of the reviews talked about the place being dirty. The only areas that were messy and dirty were by the tables of people who didn't know how to keep their stuff on the table. The staff is courteous enough to wait for them to finish eating before sweeping up their mess. So the mess and the dirtiness can only be attributed to the messy people that go there otherwise the place is clean. It got really busy and full quick . The  trays they put out are not so big and not so deep and with the amount of people that come in you can be assured that everything is hot, fresh and has not been sitting there for hours. The other reviews compared Golden Corral to Hometown Buffet, in ways it is by the type of food they serve. There was nothing there that was exciting. The usuals  spaghetti , lasagna, fried and BBQ chicken, mashed potatoes, mac n cheese the usual All American diner stuff. The difference between Hometown and Golden Corral is bigger selection and quality. The biscuits are 3 times the size, the BBQ chicken are leg quarters instead of small thighs. The dessert  selection is huge and the servings are big.  The food tasted good it wasn't bland  but it is also wasn't different. The cakes were too sweet but they had many to chose from. I was looking forward to the steaks, wings and the chocolate fountains. They didn't have the steaks or wings when I went. The fountain presentation was not as cool as I imagined it to be. All in all Golden Corral is a great place to go when you want diner food."}
{"text":"Always wanted to try G.C. but since the closest one is 50 mins away, i never got around to it. About a month ago my wife and I broke down and tried it after my Aunt went and loved it. Im not a huge buffet person but i like to go to one here and there when im in Vegas. I have tried Hometown Buffet a few times in the past and they are HORRIBLE so i was scared to try G.C.  First off the lines are InSaNe but you know what? it is totally worth it. The price is reasonable and the food is actually really good. The steaks were awesome and so was 98% of the rest of the food. I have been back since and it never disappoints. Its alittle small so they cram you in but whatever. Why are these not at more locations? There really isnt many around. So i say give 'em a try...i really like this place."}
{"text":"Just finished eating at the Golden Corral for lunch. It was $8.99 not including a drink. The waiter left something to be desired but everyone else was on point. All of our refills came from who I'm assuming was the manager or someone who didn't introduce herself as our original server. The food was good. The salad bar is always great. I love picking my own ingredients for a salad and I love their bourbon street chicken. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Ah, there is nothing like a Golden Corral to remind me of the drunk nights I've spent looking for food down in the South. The food here is bad, and the restaurant is full of societal dregs. You will see children of low income families dip their fingers into the chocolate fountain, run around crying,  bump into your food, and yell constantly. Simply put, do not eat here unless you are under the influence of a drug/alcohol, as the experience will be horrible."}
{"text":"Compared to Home Town or whatever buffet, it is actually pretty decent, for the price you pay, I wouldn't mind coming back, but them lines be long, so you are going to have to be patence. The lines resemble a theme park line as you wait and then begin to zig zag around till you reach the cashier, if you want a drink, you have to grab a cup, fill it up and then proceed to the cashier. Soda or tea is about $2.00, and I think dinner was around $15. After you pay, you tell the lady how many people are in your party, they direct you over to your table, and then you begin to gather your food like the hungry animal that you are.  They have a variety of items, the steak is grilled in front of you and you tell the chef how you like it, medium rare actually came out medium rare, which was pretty good for a bland steak. They have hot wings that are pretty good, but the garlic hot wings tasted exactly like the regular hot wings, not sure if the chefs just dumped it in and hoped people thought they were different. The pot roast and meatloaf weren't bad, they actually have murals showing you their cooking process. Fried chicken was semi dry, but it was cruncy. Chicken noodle soup was good, but barely any chicken, and they never refilled the clam chowder.  Not much else to say about this place, I don't think I ate any vegetables cause they looked old, and seemed like they were sitting there for awhile."}
{"text":"This place is always busy! That's great for a buffet because you know the food is fresh, as it's constantly being replenished. Our server we had was so friendly I wish I could have given her a bigger tip because she showed EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!! I thanked her and told her we'd request her every time from now on. Her name is Rachel and she's awesome! You rock, girl! I also let her Manager know how pleased we were with her service, he wasn't surprised he said she's 1 of the best. Keep up the good work! :-)"}
{"text":"Whatever \"bug\" compelled me to try this place is one I hope to squash next time I get the urge to visit the local Golden Corral.  Four people, four soft drinks, over $61.  I can get two pizzas, drinks for the kids, and a pitcher of beer at Barro's for half that!  They charge extra for drinks at $2.29/drink and $11.99 for each person.  Ridiculous!  The food wasn't bad, it wasn't great either and it wasn't worth the price.  The tables are jammed so close together in the restaurant that you have to get up to let someone out at the next table over.  I went over to what looked like the taco bar.  Plenty of taco meat, plenty of cheese, no tortillas or taco shells however."}
{"text":"Horrible food. County jail severs better food. The place is filthy dirty including the workers."}
{"text":"Was feeling kind of lazy and decided to take my family out to eat.  We ended up here, due to 5 people wanting something totally different to eat.  I was pleasantly surprised with the food.  Everything was pretty tasty, loved the Bourbon chicken, unlimited steaks, salad bar, fried shrimp, pizza can go on ALL DELICIOUS!!!  except for the sauteed mushrooms what a disappointment.    Be warn you will come out feeling like a stuffed turkey.    The only con was that the waiter is the one whom has to bring you a refill.  And they don't have all you can drink milk, =(  This place is always busy, best time to go is during the week.   Friday night and weekends we've seen the line wrapped around the building.  But very well worth the wait."}
{"text":"ok people  this is one of the best places i've been to in a long time , , good  food selection ,plenty of parking . friendly helpfull staff and servers , big props to our server vanessa , great sense of humer  and service ethics, great job well done , ok down to the food it s has only been open a short time lets see how they hold up in the quality dept. today it was great , reason i didnt give 5 stars  is room for growth"}
{"text":"La selección no es la mejor todo esta salado, y se tardan mucho para poner lo que se acabo, no creo que regrese a este lugar"}
{"text":"This is your typical Hometown Buffet type restaurant. I would say it's a little better than Hometown because of the quality of the food and the cleanliness of the place.   GOOD - Steak - Fried and BBQ chicken - Fish - Fried shrimp - Mashed potatoes - Cotton candy - Chocolate fountain - Bread pudding - Service from the waiters  BAD - Salad bar (it wasn't bad but don't waste your time at a buffet at the salad bar) - Chinese food section - Mexican food section - Long lines   When we first got there at 6:40 on a weekday, the line was out the door and halfway through the parking lot. We decided to brave it and we finally got seated about an hour later. (Be warned, there is a line inside as well, just you get through the doors) If you don't want to wait, I would recommend going before 5:00 PM or after 8:30 PM. There's a large parking lot but it's not connected to the Olive Garden shopping center parking lot."}
{"text":"Well I grew up going here and other buffets and the food has always been really good.  I love those soft biscuits with some brown gravy.. I could eat 12 of them (I'm a bread guy) ..they are always looking to improve, but I love it the way it is."}
{"text":"Food wasnt so good .. place was really dirty and too many people in the middle of restaurant.... they should have it set up like sweet tomatoes and have the cashier on one side... my poor 3 year old got food poisoning a few hours after eating there... he threw up all night.... lesson learned i will never go back"}
{"text":"The most horrible meal I've had in a very long time, even made my fiance and I ill. Everything was hard and cold, there were a ton of things that were empty. The waitress was rude, the cooks were dirty and sloppy. We will never return here. Horrible."}
{"text":"Confusing. First time diners. Went on Sunday morning at 11. Line was out of the door. We thought this must be excellent food. 30 dollars for 2 with no drinks. Huge selection of mediocre food. Confusing part was why."}
{"text":"Well it's not like back home, but it was cool. If the eating utensils were cleaner, I would bumped them up some more. I'll come back one day & maybe just maybe....  All in all, not that bad. If u don't know me by now, I'm what u call a \"people watcher\" (ok jus a lil nosey), which brings me to my next point.  I still don't understand why the table next to had older teens (we're talkIng mustache&sIdeburns) and all they ate was Mac&Cheese, Pizza & nuggets. C'mon, if that's all u were going to do, well save ur parents the extra $$$ and get $5 Lil Ceaser or $10 Pizza Hut meal deal. There lil sis did more damage & she was no size at all."}
{"text":"Since this is the only GC within several hours driving distance, they always have a long line. Of the several times I've gone there has been a wait outside the door, from 1.5 hours on opening day to as little as15 minutes during their 'slow' times. They are very accommodating to parties large and small. Notably their food selection and quality are far above their local competitor Hometown Buffet. They always have food ready despite many people eating at one time. I'm a huge fan of the cheddar biscuits. My gf is fond of all the dessert offerings including the chocolate fountain. The downside to this location is the small seating capacity. Perhaps that is why they always have a long line. Prices are similar to HTB. The time I would go is during breakfast. Food during this time awesome. Either way I would recommend this place if you want to stuff your face and be ushered out in a wheelbarrel. Top stars for the food, 1 star for the wait. Add more seating capacity!"}
{"text":"When you compare price to options, hands down the best. The quality of the food is amazing to what might be expected. The price is the price, the discount is the price for all that you get. Yum yum, and more yum!"}
{"text":"Poor customer service. Management was not helpful at all in helping resolve our issues. I was very disappointed in the service our large party received. I would not recommend visiting this location with more than 6 guests."}
{"text":"Despite the long wait~ the food & service were pretty good~ delicious & very fresh~ I love the ribs, steaks (juicy and full of flavor), fresh salad bar, and I love the chocolate fountain. Eating the cotton candy and ice cream made us feel like little kids~ it was FUN!!  The service was pretty good~ At least they tried with huge crowd.  cons: they need to work on the \"wok station\", the Asian food taste \"blah\" and looks very unpleasant!!  The long line! The atmosphere -they could use more warmer tone decorations n lighting to make the customers feel more relaxing and welcomed."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting the atmosphere and the food and the employees. Nothing like the locations in LA. I cannot believe that a person thats serving my food is eating at the same time that is totally vile!! I brought my fiancee for the first time and regreted it right away. The food was hard, burnt, and tasted disgusting! The only exception is the salad bar but yet thats pre made  and it comes bagged so nothing to mess up there. I dont know whats going on with management here but Im never coming back to this location!!"}
{"text":"So I heard a lot if rave reviews and its always crowded so I said hey what the hell....yeah what the hell indeed. Pros: -cheap  Cons: Food was subpar Pork wasn't cooked all the way Enchiladas had fake cheese product Marshmallows tasted like they were circa 1987...bad year for marshmallows apparently  Did I mention all the freakishly obese people...seriously woman that was your 5th cotton candy."}
{"text":"I had never been here before and had only heard bad reviews.....however we went there tonight...my parents took my husband and I for our anniversary and I was BLOWN AWAY...it was so unexpectedly delicious, I've been to almost every buffet in town and this is by far one of the best, everything was so fresh and yummy...tasted fresh out the oven or off the stove..the catfish was soooo good and the service was awesome...the server told us they had a new chef and he had really been turning the place around...well she was right cuz EVERYTHING I tried was ON POINT!! Whoever this new chef is\" he is Amazing!! Good for u whoever u are!! Thank u for a delicious meal!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here with my cousins from LA.  Where do I start? There was a line outside the door but it wasn't too bad considering that it just opened yesterday. Didn't take that long to get in.  They were super efficient in getting you seated.  There were no lines in getting your food because there are so many stations. Some of the items they had were:  salad bar,  wok station, egg rolls, pasta, lasagna, steak sliders were delicious, enchiladas, quesadillas, popcorn shrimp, fish, hush puppies, fried chicken, meat loaf, lots of desserts including a chocolate fountain with strawberries for dipping. Too many other things to mention.  They have servers that come to your table bring you fresh drinks.  They have steak on their dinner menu. Don't know what else is different for dinner.  We really enjoyed our lunch and will be back. Oh, they also have ice cream and cotton candy.  It felt like a party in there."}
{"text":"Mark this as another chapter in \"What were you thinking???!!!!\"   This was our third time to the Golden Corral.   The last time was in Hanover, Maryland.  As tourist in Maryland, we were full of crab cakes before we ate at the Golden Corral.  So this time should've been different.   Wrong again!   The coworkers took me to Seoul Garden in Tustin for my birthday lunch.  Seoul Garden is a buffet.  The coworkers and I ate so much, that I was still full from lunch at dinnertime.  But, the wife and daughter needed to celebrate my birthday.  I was thinking Osaka Seafood Buffet, but, with me being so full, I thought Golden Corral was a better and cheaper choice.  I am not sure if it was a good choice.    The Good:   The Cashier.  I told her that I wasn't hungry and that she should give me the Senior discount.   She did.  The fried chicken was good.    The Bad:  The steak.  I asked for rare, and got medium.   I tried again, and got it raw.  Also bad was going there when you are not hungry and wasting $11.  The waiter forgot to bring us water.   I had to ask him twice.     The Ugly:   The disabled lady that my wife saw take two bites out of a biscuit while waiting in line, and decided she didn't like it, and puts it back with all the other biscuits.    It is weird to see that I am one of the skinniest people in the Golden Corral (and I am not skinny).  Even though this place is owned by an Asian, as evidenced by the incense that they burn outside in the front planter, and the plants with red ribbons given as a gift for their grand opening, they really should'nt be following the Golden Corral's recipes for Chinese food.   You can't serve imitation Chinese food with so many Chinese restaurants in the vicinity.  The last two visits to the Golden Corral have been a waste of time and money.   I may have to give them another chance.    If you come on a weekday before 6PM, there is no wait.  2 1/2 stars!"}
{"text":"Food was terrible. All I could taste in the chicken or onion rings was grease. The butter steak was alright but the desserts were terrible as well. The brownies were hard as rocks & the strawberries they served were still green. Will not be coming back at all."}
{"text":"Need to really pig out? Then this is your hog heaven for sure. I've been to buffets before where they had mostly stuff dumped outta oil drum-sized cans, but this place not only had vegetables that tasted like they were made from fresh but had an excellent salad bar and some of the best tasting and tenderest steak I've had in a long time, and it was cooked just as I ordered. The catfish had a light corn meal coating and wasn't dried out yet crispy delicious. And the hot yeasty rolls--so good, but try not to eat more than one or you'll miss out on so many other tasty treats. For dessert lovers, there's cakes and pies and a chocolate fountain and fruit to dip in it, and even cotton candy. Really can't list everything they have at this food wonderland, so go when you have time and appetite to take it all in. The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is that it was just way too noisy because it was crammed with people and there were some ill behaved children that were not kept under control and the intermittent squalling babies did not add to the ambience.  Also, I arrived earlier than my friends and they won't seat you until your party is complete, but heck, there is no waiting area and this is Phoenix....way too hot outside and it's a buffet so who cares if some of your party come earlier and want to get a head start on the food fest?!"}
{"text":"Here in Vegas we are spoiled with a variety of top rated buffets. And this place is pretty good for a non-casino buffet. There is a good selection of food items, and they usually change up the featured dishes every so often and include specials during the holidays.   I have been here several times, and haven't been disappointed. My favorites from my most recent visits are the BBQ chicken flatbread, Smokehouse BBQ pulled pork with choice of 4 different BBQ sauces, my fave sauce is the South Carolina vinegar!!!    On the weekends till about noon or 1pm they have breakfast items and an omelet station. I usually go here on Saturday and Sundays.   TIP: Come in during that time so you get a choice of both, breakfast/brunch and lunch items!   There are a lot of options and you can easily craft your plate to fit low carb or Keto diets, or at least be Keto friendly. I've shared some photos of my Keto friendly plate creations.   Great service here from almost all the employees except one. He's been rude on several visits so we avoid sitting in his section.   I can't wait till they finish the Henderson location! It would be much closer for me.   Great for families and my first choice for non-casino buffet!"}
{"text":"Wow way to long to eat here. You have to wait in line to pay, you have to wait in line to sit down, you have to wait in line for your food overall if your hungry I really suggest going somewhere else. Food was good but just to long for me."}
{"text":"It was good , but when I called they told me it was $13.99 plus drink, I had a coupon for a free one for my birthday , so after we got there he charged my husband $14.99 instead of $13.99 plus 2 drinks , it came out to 21. dollars and some change, damn!! i COULD HAVE PAID FOR 2 BUFFETS FOR THAT PRICE , SO WHERE IN THE HELL DID MY FREE ONE COME IN?"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me Friday night for our second month anniversary and it was my first time.  He was not kidding that the buffet had anything and everything and that it all tasted really good.  We both had steak and went for seconds and thirds on that and I went for dessert and even had cotton candy!  We will definitely go back.  Seems pricy to me, but you gotta consider the foods that are available to eat.  Ribs, steak, chicken, brisket, etc!!"}
{"text":"It feels weird to give a buffet 5 stars, mostly because I'm used to the Hometown Buffets of the world. Golden Corral is so much better than that.   First of all their selection is great. Feel like eating a salad? (Who are you people anyways?) A steak? Chinese? Mexican? Italian? Sea food? They got you covered.   If you're like me and make a beeline to the steaks, I'm happy to report that they're delicious. Comparable to Black Angus and they're a steak house.  They also have all kinds of bread, desserts, ice cream and the famous chocolate fountain.   Service is also excellent. Our waitress was very nice and friendly.   Overall a great experience. I just wish they were closer to me (they're about 30-45 min away). On second thought though, it's probably better for my waist line that they're not.  *Note: I went on a Tuesday and the wait was about 30 min (which isn't too bad for a party of 6 like us). However be warned that on weekends the wait is closer to 1 1/2 hours."}
{"text":"The worst I gave ever been to, party of 4 . No yeast Rolls no seafood salad fried chicken way over cooked refill on drinks came after we were done no coconut cream pie 8-("}
{"text":"Not one of the better buffets around. My server was very nice, but most of the food on the buffet was dried out. The macaroni and cheese looked completely crusted over and the pizza was all dried out. I'm not sure why there was breakfast food on the buffet at 1:00 pm. I felt kind of cheated as the breakfast food took up a good amount of room. The soups were very good and fresh. Penny was my server. Very nice older lady."}
{"text":"I don't understand why this place has long lines. I'm a eat whatever don't care about my health kind of person but dam I'm not coming here ever again. They seated me and my family in the corner where they put  the brooms and those scoop thingys which had food it in -_- which wasn't very pleasant to see while I was eating.  At first this place look pretty good, but nothing surprised me. The only thing good that came out of this place was the chocolate chip ice cream. I'd say try it if you're curious, but in my opinion I'd recommend to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I am not a big fan of buffets. Not that the food is bad in all cases, sanitation however is something else. Golden Coral fails miserably on both.      From the tables to the walls to the floor to the door everything felt like it had a film of tacky grease on it. The bathroom was hellish. My luck someone was pinching a loaf at the time. I swear I smelled my shirt when I left, the stench was so penetrating.       Now to the food. The steak was horrid. It is marinated in a sodium nightmare. I asked for mid rare and this piece I got was so raw I swear it stood up on the plate  and mooed. The veggies were overcooked, the fried chicken was tollerable, and I had a piece of halfway decent fried fish.       The desert bar was scarce, the chocolate fountains looked dirty, the area around did I mean. The only good thing on there were the rolls.        If you prefer buffets find another. This place is not worth your momey. I needed a shower when I got home."}
{"text":"I have been to this location many times and, as usual, it disappointed me again. I always hope that things will change but they don't. The Founders Sirloin Filet that they advertise is extremely fatty and very tough to chew. The Garlic Marinated Sirloin is rationed. If you want more than one piece you need to make a second trip to get it. Apparently the employees can only give you one piece at a time. A lot of the dishes were not at the proper temperature (not hot enough). The service is terrible. When I pointed out a problem to one of the management team I was told \"Don't worry about it\" as if this person could not be bothered. I drove quite a distance to eat here because it's the only Golden Corral in Las Vegas. No more. I'm not going to waste precious gas to be disappointed and treated like crap. I'd rather eat at Burger King."}
{"text":"My son wanted breakfast, but we had lunch. I actually enjoyed what I ate, and didnt feel stuffed like a pig when I left.   Ill return eventually."}
{"text":"Scrumptious American Heaven deliciousness. Nothing is bad in this place!   Its a 10 star every time..very consistent. Friendly service!"}
{"text":"Wow, talk about disappointing!  The whole reason we came here was because they used to have steak and eggs.  When I walked up and asked for eggs, I turned to the grill guy and asked \"can I get a steak medium?\". He laughed at me and said \"at 4pm\".  Annoyed I turned around and walked up to the manager and asked why the grill guy would say that... He said \"we haven't served steak at breakfast for years\".  Then I remember why our family stopped coming here - the attitude of the employees was horrible.  To add salt to the wound I turned back around and asked for my eggs and the guy said \"we gave them to someone else, I can make more if you still want them. \". Really?  So I walked a few steps over to find both the French toast and pancake bins empty.  I asked \"can I get some pancakes?\" - grill guy seemed annoyed now and said \"we're working on it...\" So then I walked around and took notice that many of the bins were empty.  To boot, the waitress barely spoke a lick of English.  The kids enjoyed the desert stuff... But that was about it.  I suppose you get what you pay for, and we won't be coming back.  Not the worst food or service I've ever had, but it's close."}
{"text":"By far the WORST buffet my husband and I have eaten at... let's just say we have eaten at some real dumps and this tops them all. Before entering the restaurant we found 2 different colored weaves, yes WEAVES in the parking lot. Should have been red flag number 1. We then enter restaurant and as we are waiting in line we see several children aged 5-7 up at the buffet touching the food with their hands. Should have been red flag number 2. As we get seated we waited 15 mins before getting silverware and straws, but get this they were out of clean silverware so we had to wait even longer. Red flag number 3. We then go up to the buffet line that is so picked through, thought my husband and I were going to have to fight over a chicken wing bone. We waited for them to restock the food and everything we tasted, couldn't even choke down. Not to mention they crammed us in a corner by a family of 4 who did nothing but fart and belch the entire meal. I'm not one to complain, but my goodness this was a pile of poop. If you like pizza and Mac n cheese, by all means this is your place, ate one plate. We then thought okay, maybe dessert is better, NOPE. There was a child sticking his fingers  in the chocolate fountain and then licking them. Safe to say we booked it after that. Place is a poopshoot"}
{"text":"Well.... came back for round two, food is not bad it's usually fresh due to it always being busy..The service has not been bad this time .."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my birthday dinner today. The food was mostly good. Some of the veggies were over cooked but for the most part everything was excellent. Great chicken livers!! Great desserts!!"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant in Mississippi a few years back. This restaurant / buffet is great in my opinion. Even better then Hometown Buffet. The variety of food is amazing as well as the quality. The interior was clean and the staff was good."}
{"text":"I have attended three Golden Corral's and each one has been very good. In my opinion, I believe that GC's (Golden Corral) are better than Home Town Buffet. The food is good and fresh every time I attend. The only thing I do not like about the GC's is the large crowd. The GC's are always packed and I do not know if it because of the low price per person or the quality of the food. GC is a  great place to eat and I love attending when I have a chance."}
{"text":"Restaurant is not staffed or equipped to handle volume. Staff are most likely x felons. Lines are long inside and outside the buffet. They pack you in like sardines and the place is filthy attracting a like minded clientele. The food quality is average. Save your money and time!!!"}
{"text":"I'm in Sun City visiting my mom, and apparently this is a favorite of she and her husband. I'm absolutely stunned, as they usually have decent taste. Thus place was truly terrible.  The only redeeming quality was that it was relatively clean."}
{"text":"2 weeks ago, I had a hankering for Golden Corral Rolls. Being pregnant, I crave really weird stuff, and that just happened to be what I wanted that day. While I was there, I decided to go ahead and just get a to-go box for lunch... since I try to eat relatively well, I figure a little Mac n Cheese wouldn't hurt with my chicken, carrots, green beans, broccoli, and fruit. Like, seriously, why did I even look twice at the Mac n Cheese? That's because I have always had a very love relationship with GC Mac N Cheese! I mean, for heaven's sake, my mom took me to GC for my 9th birthday, where they spilled a TRAY OF DRINKS all over me and didn't apologize. (I'm pregnant and straying from what I'm trying to say ).  What I'm trying to say is, I was READY for Mac N Cheese. I get home 10 minutes after I leave GC, and open my box. My rule: healthy food first because, well, I'm pregnant. I can't eat that much anyway and I'd rather fill up on fruits and veggies.  I get 1 bite into the Mac n Cheese, and I'm thinking \"Woah, this does not taste like I remember.\" I take  another bite and as I am chewing, I see a FREAKING GREEN SPOT IN THE NOODLE!! Like... IN THE NOODLE! It tastes like mold to me because there was mold in the freaking noodle!!  So, what do I do? I call the location I went to. The woman at the register remembered me. I asked for the manager, and was told he went out to get some copy paper from Sam's Club. OKAY, no big deal. I've worked at places where we've run out of something before our reorder.   When I don't hear back for 3 hours (I assume it doesn't take 3 hours to get copy paper from a store that is literally 4 minutes away), I call again. I explain the situation to the manager, get a bullsh*t excuse from the manager as to why I wasn't called back right away, and he says to come get a refund.  Well, it's a Friday, and I was about to leave for work, and I work late on Fridays. So, after work, I called, and he says \"Don't worry, come on Monday, and I can give you a gift card.\" Do I look like I want a gift card? I want my money back!! When I was 9, and the lady spilled 6+ drinks all over me on my birthday, it took me 10 YEARS to go back. What am I going to do? Hope that Golden Corral is still open in 10 years?! I told him I wanted a refund, and he tells me I can only get a refund within an hour of the purchase time. I called before that hour was up.  Not only that, but how was he going to give me a refund in the first place?! Why can't I get my money?! He then says VERY AGGRESSIVELY \"Are you never going to eat here again? Your Mac n Cheese sits next to the green beams. It was probably a piece of green beans! I will give it to you from my pocket, then!\" I end it there because I don't like losing my cool, crying, or anything like that. I hang up, and move on with my night (aka this thing called sleep). I HATE being interrupted when I'm tying to talk. I HATE being yelled at by grown BOYS who think they know what I'm talking about.  I then emailed customer service, and I'm still waiting for a response... 2 weeks later. Yes, I've checked my junk mail. So, instead, here is what we get-- a beautiful picture of my molded Mac n Cheese.  Enjoy eating at Golden Corral, where you don't know how old your food is when they put it out! & Jose, just know, it's not a fucking green bean. It's mold.  PS if another manager sees this, please note that Jose told me not to talk to other managers because then he would have to be called on his day off and talk about the situation. So, have fun with that!!"}
{"text":"Ok this is a buffet and somethings are not up to most people's standards but let me tell you the breakfast is by far the best value for your money. The omelet section is a favorite and you choose what you want in it and put in a bowl and hand over. Love this you can put in what you want and how much and it is perfect. Sliced ham, chicken fried steak, hash fried potatoes oh my as a senior $8.49 for breakfast including your drink is really good. The dinner service could stand to have a little more attention to the hotness of the food but still a great value for the price. Try the breakfast and see what you think. I go at least twice to three times a month."}
{"text":"Came here a few times with coworkers for lunch, and it's not a bad place.  Not a big fan of buffet food but I'll eat it.  Only live once and we live to eat.  The place is always packed, and the cleanliness of the place is not very good probably due to all the people out and about and all around.  If you need to do a two, you better off doing it at the tree outside, I wouldn't sit on the toilet here if I were you, might catch something.. Some of the clean plates still had food stuck to them... The workers are very friendly and attentive, they would always come and see how we are doing and see if we need more coffee or soda or water.  Very friendly and professional staff they have.   The food, they have a huge variety of foods!  Their meatloaf pretty good!  Love the ketchup on it, honey ham was fresh out of the oven when I got my slice and it was juicy and tasty.  The steak a little tough for my taste, they had potatoes of many kinds.  Many types of vegetables, from corn to green beans, carrots and lettuce and Brussels sprouts.  The bun and the apple pie thing was awesome.  Chocolate fountain thing for strawberries very cool indeed.  They have both soft serve ice cream, and the kind you scoop out of buckets, for that you need to ask a worker to do for you.  Wise, I would go over board if I did it on my own, and too much ice cream can be a bad thing for me.     Overall a good place to hang out and stuff yourself.  I'm not a fan of buffets but this place will serve its purpose if you want to try a variety of foods for a single price.  You definitely get what you pay for here, good value."}
{"text":"So much food to pick from...When I want to pack on the pounds and feast on good ole meat and potato's this is on top of my list.  When I go out with the guys its almost a competition of who can eat the most plates.   The rolls are excellent, the selection is great, yes you can pound down fresh salad and fruit if you are on a diet.  Or go all out and eat sweet potato mash with marshmallows and turkey and gravy....Thanksgiving everyday :)  Great tip: Arrive before 11, I would go at 1030 eat some bacon and eggs and then after 11 they serve lunch items.  Great breakfast items also.....Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"I'm not a buffet's in general but my boyfriend and his daughter wanted to eat here so I sucked it up. Every plate was dirty, I pulled a spoon out of the bucket and it had dried up gravy all over it...like it had never been washed. Kids were sticking their hands in the chocolate fountain and everything was bland and gross. 2 out of 3 of us got sick from it."}
{"text":"Don't arrive here on an empty stomach or hungry! The lines are ridiculous and it seems that they are always giving free 65in TVs due to long lines and might take up to as long as 11/2-2hr (so I heard) to get inside to the cashier. Once past the door and know were you are going to be seated it's time to strap on the feed bag! I'm not much of a buffet fan as I prefer quality over quantity  but it is one of the better buffets I have been too (yes, better than hometown). they constantly have the serving trays full so you can literally try everything and its always fresh and not much time under those crummy heat lamps. They are grilling, cooking and baking in from of you so you can keep an eye out on the dessert section and get it while its fresh out the oven. it's a good place to try and once you get past that long line of people in front of you."}
{"text":"It's surprising, but not all the outlets of this chain are alike. This one avoids the problem of overcooking items like pork and beef, and our server was remarkably attentive. The place was clean and they keep things were well stocked.   I like the salad bar. The main thing for a good salad bar is having lots of fresh ingredients. Keeping it fresh requires lots of traffic, and this place has that. Salads are easy to make, but having a dozen or more fresh ingredients at home would take a lot of effort.  Like most buffets of this type it's crowded and noisy at peak times, and the food is tasty, but without much spice. If you want stately silence and dedicated personal service, you should be somewhere else.  Golden Corral is a good deal, and this outlet is well run. The weekend breakfasts are the best deals, unbeatable."}
{"text":"Met my parents at Golden Corral for lunch on Sunday. They were super busy! We were seated all the way in the back where private parties are held. Getting up to the buffet was a challenge. I waited in line for several minutes just for some mashed potatoes and a yeast roll. I was disappointed to see their meatloaf had the gravy on top instead of the ketchup topping I like, so I didn't bother to try any. Other items I enjoyed were the mac & cheese, pot roast, bourbon chicken, steak fries, a pancake & french toast (love the breakfast all day, and they were freshly made!), sweet corn pudding, and a chocolate dipped star cookie & coconut macaroon for dessert. Yum! Things that could've been better besides the meatloaf- I didn't see any breakfast potatoes and the breakfast burritos were only in sausage. But overall, good eats! Just a lot of people to deal with."}
{"text":"Went to Golden Corral on Easter. Waited in line for about 15 minutes or so. There were plenty of tables available when we were seated. Everything was pretty good as usual, but they ran out of sweet corn pudding and it was never replaced, so I couldn't get any. That is one of the items I always look forward to at GC, so it was very disappointing. Also, the chocolate fountain only had strawberries and marshmallows for dipping. No cookies or rice krispy treats or anything. What a letdown! I wanted my $13.99 back."}
{"text":"I love Golden Corral and usually go to the location on Dysart but decided to give this one a try. What a mistake! I was expecting a large population of Hispanics, considering the area, but I was not expecting the mass of people coming to eat here Sunday afternoon in their church attire. The place was packed. There weren't even that many people at Dysart Golden Corral on Thanksgiving Day! I immediately felt my anxiety rise. Once seated, my friend and I had to take a moment to mentally prepare before attempting to navigate the buffet... It was so crowded. I got meatloaf, mashed potatoes, steak fries, pot roast, and a yeast roll. The meatloaf is one of my new favorite things at GC, but I noticed it looked different. It had a gravy on top instead of the ketchup I'm used to. And when I tried it, it was cold and gross. Definitely a different recipe. I couldn't eat it. And I did not get the mac & cheese I usually love because it looked like it was still frozen... my friend said it was cold. What a disappointment! The dessert bar was a nightmare to navigate. I couldn't get anywhere near the chocolate fountain. People just crowd around there and cut in line. It's awful. The dessert bar was also slim pickins... there wasn't as much selection as there normally is and what they did have was running low. The workers couldn't seem to restock quickly enough. Speaking of workers, they kept blocking the aisles and we couldn't get to & from our table easily. This location sucks and I don't ever need to come here again."}
{"text":"So I think I paid $11 USD to dine here. There was lots of food to choose from since it was a buffet and I didn't get sick, so that was a huge plus. This place is slightly out of the way from the Strip and from Downtown so it would be inconvenient to come if you didn't drive."}
{"text":"Popped into this place to grab a quick lunch between errands.  Located at the top of Litchfield Road after Walmart, at the 4-way stop, and cannot be missed.  Lots of available parking space.  Staff were friendly and welcoming as we entered.  Restaurant was very clean, little to no noise, and very spacious!  Lot of different areas/sections to eat.  Tables are cleared away promptly and staff did check on us from time to time.  As I mentioned the restaurant was very clean as I noticed spillages from the food stations were addressed immediately.  Lunch buffet price - $9.79 + soda ($2.50).  Only areas they lose -- limited variety in food (-1) - didn't notice seafood options or maybe I came on the wrong day; and food was very tasteless (-1).  I probably will not return!"}
{"text":"Picture, if you will, this scenario.  You're hungry.  So you drive to a buffet.  Instead of walking in and eating, you decide to stand around for 2 hours and 20 minutes before chowing down on very mediocre, incredibly salty food.    I'm not sure what possessed us to do this.  Maybe the long line inspired some mysterious image of deliciousness waiting to reward our patience.  Sadly this was not to be.    To add insult to injury we had to wait another 20 minutes after walking in the door all the while enduring a gauntlet of sodas, iced teas, and juices BEFORE finding out at the cashier that it's extra.  And to throw some salt on that wound it's Pepsi.    Once inside you would imagine being grateful to get off your feet but the harsh lighting and the crowded spaces has all the ambiance of a maximum security prison cafeteria.  Don't make any sudden moves.    As others have stated the rice is mushy.  All the fish related stations were way too salty.  Tartar sauce was the standout.  Steak was actually ok but it is SO GREASY.  It's sitting in a pool of grease and then it's flanked with big blobs of fat to boot.    The way the food is arranged creates the illusion that there is more variety than the other behemoth buffet chain but it turns out they string out the food so only one side is accessible meaning more people have to crowd around and wait and there is actually probably around the same variety.  Bottom line: don't let the long lines fool you.  You're better off going elsewhere.   Seriously."}
{"text":"I've been there a couple of times. The service is good...the food is marginal...but what turned me off is when I saw this old guy drooling as he walked toward the food. I'll never be back!"}
{"text":"Having trouble on what to have for dinner and have a big appetite, Check out this place The desserts are great and so is the fresh food. I love coming here and trying different types of food every time I go here."}
{"text":"Took the kids to Golden Corral because the wife was out with friends.  My wife refuses to eat here.  The food was the same as before.  The steak was pretty tasty and so were the mashed potatoes.  I usually just stick with the classics.  My daughter had a salad and some chicken, which she enjoyed.    The service and atmosphere were pretty bad.  They definitely could improve in that area.  I guess I don't blame my wife for not eating here.  It's loud.  It's dirty.  There are kids running everywhere.  It's chaotic.  I would eat here more often if it wasn't so chaotic and the workers and managers tried really hard to keep the buffets and dining room clean."}
{"text":"What to say about the corral? I love to put on my best gravy-stained NASCAR shirt and waddle on over. Plenty of open space so I can maneuver my electric scooter about and pile on the planks of salty grease. My only wish is that they would provide a blender and funnel at the table so I could pack more meat down my gullet quickly."}
{"text":"My mother, sister and niece got so sick yesterday 9/26/14. Throwing up and diarrhea ALL NIGHT!"}
{"text":"Dirty. Servers are terrible at there job. Good is below average. Went here once and will never go back. Until they change there ways and the people they hire."}
{"text":"Went to Golden Corral tonight at the recently opened location in Las Vegas.  I had never been to a Golden Corral before and didn't know what to expect, although I had done some research before hand.  My wife and I wanted lunch as to avoid what we figured would be a large dinner crowd, so we arrived about 2:30.  It was quite busy, with a line at the cashier stand, however the line moved quickly.  The major bottleneck is the beverage station, it slows forward progress as diners fill their glasses.  As long as you're going to have servers that re-fill your drinks, you might as well have them serve the initial drink to avoid the delay at the front door.    The price was good, I'm used to two-for-one deals at the casino buffets, so it was weird paying for both lunches, but the pricing was reasonable.  We were able to find a table with no difficulty, as it was seat yourself at that time.  The restaurant was clean, and tables were bussed frequently, with no piles of dirty plates or napkins cluttering the tables.    The food was very good, some items were a little bland for my taste, such as the mexican dishes weren't as spicy as I would have liked.  The meatloaf was a hit for me and my wife, which we consider the best meatloaf of any buffet.  The steakburger sliders were very good too.    We were very pleased with how often the food is rotated, I didn't see any old or dried out food on the buffet line.  We had to be careful when eating because the food was very hot, which is a plus!  I also like how you can watch the food preparation as you're eating.  It's nice to watch them cooking as your eating so you know the food is being handled well, and prepared fresh.  The desert area was very good as well.  Although it's hard to get to the fountains because of the volume of people trying to use them, it's almost always wall-to-wall people at the desert counter.  I can highly recommend the hand scooped ice cream too.  Lastly, everyone, even the other diners, were very friendly.  Everyone was observing proper line etiquette, and excusing themselves.  Not jumping in line, waiting patiently.  Such a nice change from buffets where the norm is the \"entitled\" elite who think they run the world and you must allow them to cut in front of you and in general ignore you.  It's nice to be seen and to be acknowledged and to use the people skills our parents taught us.  Oh, and there were a lot of servers, buss persons, and staff keeping everything running very smoothly.  As long as things stay the same at this location I'm quite sure it'll remain our favorite buffet in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I will never go to golden coral again the place was dirty looking had a urine smell in the back the food was cold & old service sucked there was flys landing on the food"}
{"text":"We frequent this one Golden Corral a lot. Others not so much, they don't compare to this one. This specific one is always clean, people are always super friendly, and most important the food is always fresh. In our 7+ years eating here, we have never had a bad experience.    Last night was no exception. We had our Sons 15th birthday dinner here, and had about 25 people in our party. We had two guys taking care of us, and the whole staff was funny when they totally embarrassed our Son singing to him. This was an important night as some of our guests came over 1.000 miles for this dinner. I just feel the staff here needs a thumbs up, and pat on the back. Everyone in our party had a great time.    Now the downfall, we wanted to add an additional tip to our cc when paying. The register only gave the lady two options to choose from, and it was only %'s. So she could only choose a prechosen percentage for the tip. Corporate should consider adding a way for us to add an additional amount in for the tip, or a specific amount. On large parties it automatically adds a 15% tip. So when we felt that wasn't enough we were disappointed that we couldn't add more. Had I known early I would have brought enough cash to cover the extra.    Otherwise, another great meal. Thank you Golden Corral, and thank you to the people who helped us! The lady cashier was great too, with her patience. (We had quite a few little kids) So again, thanks a bunch!"}
{"text":"Please don't go here. It was the absolute worst eating experience I've had in the last 10 years. It starts as soon as you walk in the door. You pay a ridiculous amount of money. My total was over $13 for lunch and a drink. (Instead you can have the much healthier, local-sourced ENP soup and salad buffet as an add-on to multiple $10 entrees plus a drink while your kids eat off the bar for free.) You get a dirty tray that's wet--they say they just washed it; don't believe them. I took a napkin to wipe it down just so it wouldn't be wet, and it made the napkin all dirty.  The disgusting food is laid out in several sections. Gross salad with fattening, wilted toppings, fried things, sauce-covered things, etc. There are 3 vegetables, but you have to have a secret password to eat anything that might be good for you. Items are not exactly \"pure\", e.g., my salsa had a glop of butter dropped into it. Yummy! (All jokes aside: The rotisserie chicken was really good. If you can get $13 worth of that, go for it!) About 1/3 of the items are in the dessert section. There is a chocolate fountain, but that is only to cover the crapiness of the items you dip in it. I tried to eat one of the rice krispie treats without the chocolate, and I nearly choked. Also, the chocolate is luke-warm.   EMT crews are available for heart attacks.  Anyway, thank God I brought \"Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models\" by Gelman & Hill because at least it gave me something positive to say about  my experience today: \"I love how Gelman sees problems from multiple angles and builds flexibility into the models. I can't remember the time I enjoyed reading a textbook!\"   It was this food that made possible for me to finally enjoy a statistics textbook!!!"}
{"text":"Golden Corral has once again disappointed. Went there fir dinner sftrr a year hiatus sadly it got worse. Flies under glass on food. Food gas also slipped steak was hard and dry. They no longer serve the yeast rolls at the bakery but are now with the entree. My dinner roll was dried out and crispy not what i wanted I suggest somewhere else."}
{"text":"The name sounds soooo \"blech\"  but I have to say, this place is ggoooodd!  They make home made mashed taters, they grill various steaks to your liking and offer lots of yummy veggie options.  The salad bar section has \"real\" lettuce, not just iceberg and romain - but spinach, radicchio, etc...Great place for all!"}
{"text":"First of all this is a rip off for $12, not including the drink. The place is filthy, there's food all over the floor under the tables, they are understaffed, and the food is not all that great to begin with.  It takes forever to get a drink or to get your table cleared of food. This is pissing me off because you go to the casino and get world class service, all the food you can eat, including the drink for 8 bucks!  If you like to get pissed off and frustrated, then eat here but if not, go somewhere else where they  have better service and better food. $12 my ass!  Dam!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time and loved it! For a lunch price of around $9, it was definitely worth it. Downsides include the semi-long wait and the crowded walkways with kids frantically running around. But hey, it adds to the buffet environment! With a chocolate fountain bar and a cotton candy machine, I would recommend anyone with a sweet tooth to stop by. Not to mention, there was a variety of food. Nothing fancy but nothing nasty either. For the price, why not give it a try?"}
{"text":"Went with my family back awhile back hubby got food poisoning and was never back thought it was just a one time incident but after seeing the video leak on how another store had they stored their food... Just say ill never be back because I don't want to take the chance..."}
{"text":"The management went out of her way to make this a great trip! We had a huge team of wrestlers in town for a tournament and they helped us right away and went out of their way to make it a great dinning experience!"}
{"text":"It is just like every other buffet with more comfortable seats and good location. Last time I went in I probably spent an hour and a half discussing stuff, nobody bothered me I didn't notice how time fly by. Good food too."}
{"text":"Manager of this restaurant is one of the most disrespectful \"leaders\" I have ever had the displeasure of encountering. Twice I saw him disrespect his employees in front of customers. Once yelling at an employee after she had been working for four hours that he/she couldn't go on his/her 15 minute break because he/she had more work to do. Another time yelling at his cook to go get salmon because there were no customers in line for steak, then as soon as he left, three customers showed up. Then the manager proceeded to mock the cook by saying \"Bueller\" because the cook was in the back getting the salmon that the manager had asked for. Other than that the service was great but the manager needs to show more respect towards his employees. Leaders do, bosses order..."}
{"text":"First, it is what it is. Strap your feedbag on and head for the buffet! The food is above average for a feeding trough place, and the cost is reasonable.   Like another Yelper talked about, the blue-hair's from the Sun Cities will bum rush, and walker check you to get to the buffet. It's also fun to watch them stack up at the front entrance just before 4PM, so they can get dinner for lunch pricing. Minutes later there is a geriatric scrum at the buffet when the dinner items are served. But given the choice, I'll take the old folks over screaming children.   Being a bit grossed out by many buffet's, with so many people handling the serving spoons, I was glad to see hand sanitizer dispensers.   The service was friendly and efficient, and the restaurant was clean."}
{"text":"\"What's that smell?\", my daughter asked as she wrinkled her nose. \"That, my dear, is the scent of government assistance\"  Hey, I'm no snob (but it's rumored that I'm a jackass), and Golden Corral really does offer unlimited ribs... but I don't see the benefit in having unlimited ribs when you don't care for the taste or consistency of them.  It's cheap food, and a lot of it, but I'm not a pig (although I do have my times), and I don't want to feed from a trough."}
{"text":"Just OK..... I prefer Hometown Buffet.  BAD - Line getting into the place ridiculous.   - Initial feeling was that i was being corraled into my seat.   - None of the employees were personable at all.   - Seating was very cramped.  Seating very close to each other.   - Flavors were muted.   Recipes just average.  - Selection of main dishes was sub par.   - Most of the time overcooked, dry and underseasoned. - Desserts were overcooked.  Cake and cookies dry/  - Carrot cake was tasteless and one of the worst carrot cakes I've ever had.    GOOD - Good variety - I thought the Greens, fried okra and tempura onions were good and not greasy. - Salad was good.  lettuce was fresh."}
{"text":"For a buffet this place has a good selection. Food was fresh and tasty. Excellent wait staff."}
{"text":"This place gets crazy packed and the lines are ridiculous! its out the door and when you finally get inside the door there is another line waiting! I had to wait almost 1- 1 1/2 hours just to eat here and it WAS ALL HYPE! because this is the first Golden Corral to open up down here so of course those enticing commercials we see time to time on TV makes people super excited for this one! But from my experience here this is what i have to say about this place.  - Long line & ridiculous wait - Overhyped - Drinks ARE NOT included with your meal - Understaffed and they couldn't handle all the customers pouring in - Area was not clean & dirty tables were left around - Waited 30 minutes one time to just get to the grilled steaks - People would be eating in the lines BARBARICALLY or kids will be running around with food in their hands - People are RUDE, but hey when you're hungry you tend to get grumpy - Food is WAYYYYY too salty!!! - Desserts were tasteless and stale   The only good thing was their steaks, the chef cooked it to a perfect medium rare, but  after everything i had to go through to get the steaks. NO THANKS!"}
{"text":"Great selection, and average buffet prices (and have not been successful in finding coupons!).  LOVE the sweet potato cassarole, and I can make my own chili cheese fries which are absolutely delicious!  Their steaks are decent enough, and they have many meat dishes for the meat-eaters.  In my opinion, the desserts leave something to be desired so I usually get more chili cheese fries.  However, they do have numerous desserts to choose from so you shouldn't be disappointed.  The rolls brought to your table are outstanding! *By the way, this is for the Surprise locaion*"}
{"text":"This is an older location of Golden Corral that has tried to convert to the newest Golden Corral concept.  The main problem is that they didn't remodel the business to the new and easier customer flow that the newest concept offers.  This location has new signage over the older food stations (salad, desserts, main items) and attempted to offer the new asian/italian/hispanic/seafood/etc foods without having the space for it.  This results in a very limited food selection as compared to a newer Golden Corral/  The employee carving at the grill area that also cuts the ham or other meat offerings for the customers was very polite, as was my server."}
{"text":"We went there as a second visit since opening ,went there to our surprise no waiter, they told us to sit anywhere we wanted  find our own table. So we find one then the bus boy tells us of sorry,this table is for a bigger party to find another table, so we go looking all the ones that was available were still dirty we didn't want to sit there . So they finally clean one and we go to fix food. Why I pull out a dirty spoon with dried up food still on it in the clean spoon bin?? Then food all over the floors so not clean very ghetto, and after paying for the if you ask me too much for the dinner plate for nerve to charge separate for the drinks, we not going back there, food may taste good but its too ghetto"}
{"text":"5 stars for our server Junior,  great service. He was on top of it and we were really impressed.  It was prime rib Saturday and that was good. They could work on that horseradish sauce, it's like water and ruins the meat. Teriyaki glazed sirloin was yummy but mainly wrote this review to commend good service."}
{"text":"I normally don't do Buffets but my 13 year old  niece wanted to go so I took her since I was in town to visit her last Saturday evening . She had a question about a steak on how it was cooked, so she went to ask a cook named Marcus(my niece read his name tag) about a steak,he basically ignored her and a few other customers with questions.So she went to ask Kevin and he was courteous, knowledgeable and professional and sincerely apologize for his co workers unprofessionalismn. Aside from that Kevin made it a least bit enjoyable. I will file a complaint on Marcus however. Myself dealing with customer service for over a dedcade,this is unacceptable in my eyes. Thank you."}
{"text":"I can't believe how dirty this restaurant was. I Would highly recommend they employees and Managers take a ServSafe class and get certified. There were 6 of us eating here and none of us finished our meals."}
{"text":"Yup, it's a buffet alright. A bit pricey, but I would return, not offten, but I would return. The Fried Chicken was my favorite. I am not sure what they put in thier breading, but it was delicious. If you like your steak RARE ( tell them to make it moo and bloody) otherwise thay are brown through and through. We didn't use the \"Woderfalls\". They have these little dessert cups that were just delicious even for someone like myself who dosen't care for sweets. OOOOOH they also had a \"Bourbon Chicken\" that was fabulous over rice. I took away 1 star just because of how awfully packed it was and how people let thier children do anything they want and  run rampant. We came around 3pm to miss the dinner rush and it worked fine even though we had to park in the \"lower 40\" it was very fast and we were able to get right it. I want to give a shout out to our server \"KEN\" he is awesome, busts his butt and litteraly went out of his way to make sure everyone in his station was well served! THANK YOU KEN !!!"}
{"text":"I was wondering what all the hype was because every time I passed by on the 60 fwy, I always see a line to the parking lot.  Well, a good explanation is that this place just opened up. Luckily, we went yesterday, on a Tuesday, during lunch, so our wait time wasn't bad.  I could only imagine how it would be during dinner time.  Wow, it's like a \"Vegas\" experience for local buffets.  I'm totally impressed with what this place had to offer in choice of food, desserts, and service.  There is literally something for everyone.  I think my eyes had food overload, I didn't even eat as much as I would have wanted...I think that's kind of weird saying that.  I just ended my meal by hyjacking one of those cotton candy out the restaurant.  I would definitely go back, and an overwhelming response from my other picky family members would go back as well."}
{"text":"I remember growing up in Brownsville, TX how my family considered this our luxury dining affairs. The Golden Corral... it's like a kids' paradise with all the shit you can grab and then just throw away. Parents don't give a care cuz they can freely experiment random crap to try to give their kids in hopes that they'll shove something other than pizza down their throats since one price covers all the food you can eat. That's how I do with my kids and my parents before me.  On the other side the food is pretty bad and the buffet now ranges in the double digits. So, not quite the deal it used to be. The place is usually packed and sometimes the patrons aren't the most well-mannered individuals who, oh i don't know... cover their mouths when they sneeze, or patiently wait in line for their turn, or maybe grab food with their hands and then put it back... you know... disgusting shit.  Staff is nice... I've never had a problem. The staff behind the food is all Hispanic and don't really speak English.  They do have a great variety of food. Lately they've introduced some different things like a Chinese food cart, seafood area and steak areas.  I guess the problem is that it has a bit of a reputation of being kinda \"hood\" and sometimes they live up to it.  I don't know... go check it out. I probably won't be going back to any of them any time soon. There's just to much here to review and it's mostly negative. haha"}
{"text":"I son't know if I will be back here. The wait staff was very nice and on top of things. Always has clean tables and full cups. The food was actually pretty good. We went for dinner, fresh steaks right off the grill however you like them. Rare. Medium rare. Medium etc etc. The other food was good as well. What I have mentioned so far was well worth the price. About $17 with a drink, tax and tip.   Why I may not be back, the people. The wait to get in was an hour. (we had a party of 10 mind you) Once inside there were so many ghetto, nasty, dirty people. All races. A million kids running wild. So crowded. You've got to walk through people to get anywhere. So ridiculous. Go to Woodgrill instead. It's in Norwalk. It is further away but still less time than waiting for this place.  I think I will have to go back at least once to decide if this place is on my \"No Fly\" list. Maybe not on a weekend right at dinner lol."}
{"text":"I love this place! Used to go all the time when I lived in Oklahoma. However, I did not appreciate the guy who came in with his family and their family dog! This dog was not a special needs dog!!! They could not control him on the leash! I was ready to go complain. The staff were so professional about it so as not to cause a scene and to have them come in ever so discreetly; my family did not notice the dog until I pointed it out! I hated that it had to walk by the food to the room where they hold large parties and you could see the dog while you were eating. And, they were feeding it and it was jumping around! REALLY??!! I do not recall any special needs dogs that my friends have that act like that! I am sorry, at a buffet, no pets should be allowed period. Let me tell you that after that, I walked by this table and this lady had a teacup terrier in her purse and was feeding it! I'm like What the H...! Not Cool, People! Leave your pets at home or order delivery and light candles on your patio, Fido will not know the difference, trust!!"}

{"text":"This was the third time we've been to this one in years.  Now I know why we prefer the one n Mesa.  The wet dog smell when you walk in about makes you sick.  Then to the bar.  Still had 15 minutes of breakfast time left.  Waited 10 minutes for hash browns, scrambled eggs, and bacon before deciding to try the omelette instead.  Should have just tried lunch.  The omelette was Brown, no taste, burned bacon w a funky taste, smashed hash browns, a waitress by the name of Virgina was the rudest person.  Grabbed my receipt, asked if everything was good and didn't like us giving her the truth. Can't get over the horrible treatment from any restaurant.   The lunch food wasn't any better as that's what my husband ate.  Definitely an experience I'll share on Facebook. Only chose one star as they didn't have a spot for no star."}
{"text":"I've been eating here a few years and when you don't know what you want to eat this is the place to go ! The food is good quality and my understanding this is now a franchise which many cases means improvement . They have a nice variety of entrees to choose from ! The staff is super nice and helpful , I had a lady named Lois today she's great !!!! So when your appetite is big you know where to go!!! Eat your soul away!!!! Lol"}

{"text":"Tried to have lunch here today at 12:07. Went for their signature sirloin burgers. Guess what? They were all out and weren't making any more for awhile. It was lunchtime folks and you were just open for 1 1/2 hr. WOW. Very disappointed and besides that there were many empty trays. What's going on. Don't think we'll be back anytime soon. Oh yeah, they lowered the price for general public but not for seniors. Who ever heard of just a dime lower for seniors? Outrageous!"}
{"text":"Not sure why everyone keeps raving about this place....  After much insistence, I gave up and went to see what all the hoopla was about.  Going during the dinner rush, I was immediately crushed both in front and back with families of 6 to 8.  No one ever brought bread to our table even though all the tables around us were served at least two or three times.  We requested bread four times and had to ask for our drinks to be refilled.  Still no bread, and I ran out of water so consistently that I had to swallow the food dry.  The roast was cut with the grain, making it inedible.  Veggies were overcooked.  The famous steaks people are always talking about were nowhere to be seen since they closed the grill.  As we left, the manager must have seen the unhappy look on our faces and asked if there was anything he could do.  We explained what happened to which he apologized and said that if we sat back down, he would make sure bread came to us.  Yeah, cuz the bread is SO good we want to go sit back down and wait for possibly forever again.  GUH!  Thanks, but no thanks...ever again."}
{"text":"They did a great service...the food was so good... Mmm"}
{"text":"This place is actually pretty good for a buffet. The selection is HUGE and so is the line to get in. Food is constantly coming out so it's always fresh. Service is decent. Nothing amazing though."}
{"text":"We go here maybe once every other month. It's hit or miss. The food is usually good, but we've had experiences of getting sick after we eat there as well: That may be because we already have tricky tummies, and not necessarily because of the food itself.  The waiters and waitresses are usually good, but can become overwhelmed.   This is a place where what you find usually depends on --when-- you go. You go on say... Easter? Expect chaos. You go mid-week lunch hour? Much better.  Another thing Yelp reviewers must admit --- the cleanliness of the dining area, and sometimes the buffet often depends a lot on the attentiveness of parents and their willingness to supervise and accompany their children as they should. Emphasize the word \"Supervise\". I've seen big family parties where the adults are so busy laughing and gorging themselves that the kids are running wild. That said, the employees and managers have a duty to say something to the parents. But........ in the way the world is today, that might be construed as racist or prejudice in some manner.   It's just a point to remember next time you go to GC for some food and people watching."}
{"text":"The food here is disgusting. Everything has way too much salt. I tried a little bit of almost every thing the have here, and none of it tasted good. Let me take that back. The salad was mediocre,  and note really worth remembering whether for the fact it was the best thing that have to eat here. Their desert section looks good, and I'm hoping that they don't salt that too.  The wait staff is great, which is the only reason I didn't give this place one star.   The waiter I had here is far below where he should be in the service industry. It's rare that I get great service in almost any restaurant much less a buffet. Jason my waiter here was phenomenal,  and I wish that could get service as good at his at other restaurants"}
{"text":"My motto at a buffet: Take almost embarrassingly small portions of each dish so that you can try everything.   There was no line at 8:30 in the AM. Price was only $9 for all-you-can-eat buffet. Everything was pretty good.   Here's what I ate and I'm proud of it: Fresh waffle fried chicken (there's two kinds, get the one with the smoother looking batter) smoky sausage  grits with brown sugar and butter oatmeal eggs fresh fruit slice of boysenberry pie coffee  Does not mean I took fat ass portions of each like some patrons were doing then wasting the food to go up and get other items. That's just disgusting and irresponsible eating practice. I think etiquette and portion control is out-of-control. The amount of wasted food is incredible at buffets.   This place was decent for the price. It was probably a better experience since my grandparents are in town and my brother was here telling interesting stories. My family rocks! For example: In reference to a wedding we're attending this afternoon my 80 year old grandpa just said \"Open bar, I can drink a lot of beer in 5 hours hahah.\"  Parking: Large private lot. Can fill up during peak hours, but spaces are pretty large."}
{"text":"The place was so unorganized, and to be 'politically correct'....It's GHETTO! The employees, the food, the clientele...GHETTO! We were afraid just the parking lot alone, why they do not hire security! But, if you love your fried ochra, fried chicken, corn bread and ice tea....this might be \"your joint\"!....just don't for get to wear the bullet proof vest!....."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good for a buffet for the masses. Went for lunch within the first week of grand opening. Tried to get dinner a couple of times during evening but line was out the door. $8.50 for lunch $11.50 for dinner and then add fountain drinks for additonal $1.99. One of friendliest staffs you will come across. Won't be a regular for me, too many other places to eat at in Vegas. Food is well prepared and displayed. Easy to over do it here and you will be surrounded by by those on a mission to get their money's worth. Seating is a little ackward and cramed together. It has an industrial or chow hall feel but the creew keeps it neat and clean. Worth checking out at least once. I am sure there will be life long regulars here."}
{"text":"HOMETOWN BUFFET IS DEAD TO ME!!!   I HATE buffets so much!!! I only go to one when we have our \"family dinners\" at one. I dread going to HTB because the food sucks...it seems like it's been sitting out all night and day...my mom yells at me when we would go to HTB and I would just make a salad. LoL.  Anywho....we went to GC and I liked it. So much more to choose from and food is actually hot!!! The fondue is to die for...I limited myself to 2 chocolate dipped strawberries!!! I had to or otherwise I would be like Homer Simpson and stick my whole face under it!   I was confused about the drinks at the entrance (before you pay)...not sure why they do it that way but it seemed ok. The servers kept coming to our table, my drink was never empty...and they actually have DR. PEPPER!!! SCORE!!!!   The only thing I didn't like was their \"chinese food.\" The chicken was way too hard!!! And their management sucks...and so do their \"rules.\" Your whole party has to be in line to get a table. If you're missing one person from your party, they will not seat you, or they will seat you but not give you a spot for the person(s) missing from your party. And you cannot \"pre-pay\" for other people in your party. Ugh! This sucks for huge Mexican families who are never on time...like mine! LoL.   Bottom line...I would go back to this buffet joint. Nice....veddy nice...."}
{"text":"Worst service, stood in front food waiting to have someone serve like the steak, beef ribs. No one came. So got my refund and walked out. I don't see Golden Corral being around very much longer."}
{"text":"By far THE WORST BUFFET RESTAURANT I've ever been!! Place is dirty AF even the dishes are dirty!! food is salty and dry! Food selection is very little(mostly chicken) Dont waste your money here!!  Go to fortune star instead!"}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of Golden Corral. I am not a big fan of any buffet for that matter, it might just be me LoL. My kids love this place so the only time I come is if they ask. They have a big variety and I am sure something for everyone. Everything from salad, chicken, bbq, sweets you name it. In my opinion it's just as clean as any other place. The food is average or what you would expect. This trip I do want to highlight our waitress, his name was Joey and he was very friendly and aim to please. It's also in a good location and the parking lot is very very well lit."}
{"text":"It's a buffet so you kinda know what to expect. This is like Hometown buffets more mature sister or something. The food is a step up but you still got the buffet atmosphere and crowds.  The Good: The selection is great lots of meat, It's affordable. I've never seen them let a food dish run empty.  The Bad: The carpet is kinda gross with the stains, spills and occasional smell. The server must refill your drinks and many times these guys disappear so you may have an empty drink for a good 20 min. The crowd. OMG this place got so packed one time that after we payed my family couldn't even find a seat for awile. They shouldn't let you in if you can't sit down."}
{"text":"I had to see what the hype is all about, with the line out the door every single night since it opened up a couple of weeks ago.  Going in, I didn't think the Corral would live up to my expectations.  Coming out, I decided it didn't, and I will not be returning.  And to be honest, if I had to choose, I'd much rather take my money over to Hometown now that it will be less crowded OR starve.   We arrived five minutes to 6, and the line was already out the door.  We waited a good 20 minutes before we made it to the cash register.  We were able to take advantage of the 2 for $20 special.  The promotion starts after 4 pm, Monday thru Thursday.  The third person had to pay the regular price, eh, no big deal.  We were seated fairly quickly after we paid.    Food was just okay, maybe slightly better than HTB, but not by much.  That cotton candy machine brings a nice touch to the dessert station, but it is super sticky that I did not bother with it.  Everything else was overly sweet.    Service was just okay as well.  Our server forgot to refill my brother's soda, and she never bothered to ask if I needed refill with my water.  I think the drink station should be made accessible to make things easier for all of us.    I can't say I was too disappointed with this place as I didn't have high expectations to begin with.  So if you go in with that attitude, then you'll be alright."}
{"text":"Like many of the other reviews, we saw the commercials and heard great things about Golden Corral. So today we were committed to try it out. When you first pull up to the restaurant, there are day laborers relaxing under the trees because the Home Depot is right there. No big deal. The second you walk in, you are hit with the realization that you just walked into the lions den. Ghetto is the only word that comes to mind, and it's not even a fair understatement.  Ratchet people everywhere.  Then, for someone who hasn't been there before, you have the fountain drink station before you even talk to anybody. So we asked the cashier for instructions. She said to get either the disposable fast food type plastic cups with lids and a straw or use the reusable cloudy plastic cups... I went with the disposable solely because of the area and uneasiness I felt. So I end up paying $25 and some change for my wife and I. You seat yourself. Don't wait for someone to come and seat you to a table, you will be waiting for a long time. When I asked the cashier where the straws were, she told me that the waitress will give them to you when you sit down at a table... I'm sure this is to control people from walking in, grabbing a drink, and leaving without paying. Again, very ghetto. So we go and start looking at the food and to my pleasant surprise,  all of the food looked fresh and rather good. So we start filling up our plates with small portions of everything they had to offer. Everything my wife and I ate was actually very good. Surprisingly enough, the pizza was really good and I had extremely low expectations due to the quality of pizza being served at casino buffets. My wife really enjoyed the pot roast. We ended up having two plates of small portions each and everything except the chicken fajitas was awesome. Skip on the chicken fajitas... Trust me. Then we move on to the desert section, my favorite part. Everything looked extremely well plated and delicious. I had some of the soft serve ice cream, the banana pudding, and a piece of white cake with strawberry flavoring. Very good. All in all, the food is better than every casino buffet in my opinion. I am born and raised in Vegas and have eaten at most, if not all, of the casino buffets and they just don't compare. Why 3 stars? Solely because of the environment.  The cashiers are all ratchets, the cooks are ghetto and can be heard cussing and street talking behind the cook line. Very unprofessional.  If they could pick the entire building up, dump the people out of it, and transport it to say summerlin or even a little farther west, we would definitely go back. If you're a female,  I suggest not going by yourself or at night. Wish they would open another one in a much better area, they would have much better workers and guests. When your business is in the ghetto, you have ghetto guests."}
{"text":"Let me start with the silverware- they're not clean! Luckily they had packaged disposable forks, knives and spoons.  I usually don't eat steak because I like it dry and burnt, surprisingly it was cooked right to my liking, no pink baby. That's probably the highlight of my meal. That and the freshly baked yeast rolls. So yummy, you don't need the extra butter to mess it up. Green beans  were canned and overcooked. The fried chicken didn't have enough flavor. The shrimp had too much breading, and the fountain drinks seemed to be on their last leg. I now know why kids hate Brussel sprouts, they were horrible!  I almost forgot, the cheddar cheese biscuits were good. I love chocolate, but sadly their chocolate dessert offerings from cakes, pies and the famous chocolate fountain did not do it for me. Of course on the way out, who can resist the hand-scooped ice cream? I had the Butter Pecan, so creamy, I was so happy I left room for it.  And, no I will not talk about the restroom today. Someone's been calling me out on that =)."}
{"text":"I'm not a Golden Corral kinda person- I was raised on \"classier\" (read: pricey) places, so I've been a bit of a restaurant snob. However, being a snob means you miss a lot of great places. Some are great for their atmosphere, others for the service, others for the food- or some combination of these. When I came to Vegas I was a bit disappointed in the places that get lots of stars and praise. Even my non-snobby partner has been sorely disappointed in the seafood and soul food places we've visited.   Today we tried the Golden Corral. I'd been to one in Ohio and don't have a lot of good memories- except for the fun company I was with. I expected low quality fare and general unpleasantness. I was pleasantly surprised.   Now, the atmosphere is nothing to write home about. The money here is not being spent on decor and dinnerware. Or bathroom maintenance. It was crowded as heck tonight, but this allowed a lot of people-watching, which is fun in a place that attracts such a wide range of humans. I like seeing people enjoying themselves. There were lots of young children, toddlers and some babies with parents and grandparents.   I've been to several buffets in town, on & off Strip. I'm usually disappointed in the local casino buffets. The food isn't well flavored and the desserts all seem to come from the same bland supplier. Little of the iconic fare, like Mac & cheese, taste anywhere close to authentic.   Golden Corral has them beat by a mile. The food tastes like your grandma invited the family for dinner, and then stuck her FOOT in it! (some of you will know what that means). Fried chicken the chefs weren't afraid to season properly. Buttery mashed potatoes with a few lumps instead of being perfectly puréed to death by machine. Crispy hush puppies and fried shrimp. Whole catfish! Well, without the heads. Even the fried calamari tasted good.   Now, grandma does make some greasy food- but those hush puppies! Perfectly fried. I'm not into the slightly sweetened hush puppies but I forgave grandma and went for more. The fried okra was very good with no nasty okra-ness (it's okra, after all).   Parents seem to let their kids run around here- something I haven't seen at the casino buffets I've been to. I saw one young girl skipping through the crowd while innocently holding a steak knife, point-side up.   Dessert was more creative than other buffets. A chocolate fountain with humongous, sweet strawberries on sticks to wave underneath. Marshmallows and macaroons are also available.  They had the standard soft ice cream, cookies and cake slices, but they also had real ice cream, sherbet, and freshly made cotton candy. All the food was fresh, by the way.   Anyway, we hung out for over two hours because we had time to kill. Our server was excellent (hey, Nickie!) and we tipped her well to make up for the measly $2 tips she was getting from others and the time we spent. I can honestly say I was comfortable, had a good time, and actually enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"Last Sunday I went to eat.  I was pretty tired and not in a great mood and thought it would be fast and easy for me.  I have eaten here at least once per month since this place opened and always enjoyed it.  But... It had been awhile since we had been there.  Like I said when I went I was pretty dis-satisfied.  I am a tough person to dis-satisfy at a buffet as I am pretty versitle when it comes to eating.  First off I love their fried chicken.  Always fresh and crispy.  But I only like white meat.  They had two trays out and although one said white meat, all of the chicken was thighs and legs.  Now they have breakfast for lunch and dinner.  I do not eat breakfast food.  Ever.  Because they had to make room for breakfast food, that took some of the selection away from what they used to have.  I always like to drink chocolate milk when I eat there.  This time, when I asked the busser (or waitperson) told me I had to pay for it when I bought my meal.  I have never been charged before, and if they decided to begin charging extra for chocolate milk, they should tell you when you pay.  I made a taco.  With all of the taco fixings I took a plop of what I thought was sour cream and placed on top of my lettuce, salsa and meat.  Turned out it was whipped cream.  Ruined that taco.  The rest of the food was good as always, just don't think it will be worth it for me any longer."}
{"text":"Went again yesterday only because this is where the group I was with wanted to go.. This location needs help.  The one in Robinson is much nicer and cleaner.  This one seems to have a problem with staffing.  Our lady was really nice but we could tell she probably was stretched thin on the tables she served.  The plates were dirty,  you had to drink the ice cream with a straw it was so runny and the staff had a hard time keeping up with the dessert demand.  On a good note the salad bar was clean and fresh, they have lots of vegetable options and the food did not appear to be as salty.  Still if you have to do GC go to Robinson..."}
{"text":"We've been wanting to try a Golden C. Restaurant for quite awhile.  I thought it unusual to get drinks before reaching the cash register.  After paying, we were directed to a table.  The entire area was filthy!  There was so many dirty tables nearby and the floor was simply a mess!  After finding the plate and silverware booth we could finally eat.  The food was pretty decent but many things were empty.  I had to go up more than once to find fresh offerings.  The staff just couldn't keep up.  There were never any spoons so they brought us plastic silverware for dessert.  The chocolate fountain was shut down because a child was double dipping... That area was a mess anyway.  All in all, a hugely disappointing experience.  We won't go back."}
{"text":"Fucking  disgusting their  prices are horrible they over charge you I spent almost $50.00 bucks on some nasty ass food and there was a dead roach in the women's restroom. Just disgusting would never eat there again."}
{"text":"I suppose it average. The food is decent and okay. Not much else. The BBQ meat is pretty good and i loved the breaded shrimp. Have plenty of choices but I don't go far and stay with the same things. Also, the big spoons to serve yourself with are really greasy and feel dirty. I'd suggest holding them with a napkin to keep your hands clean. Everyone touches it but that's what Buffet s are.  Also they have a small but good amount of desserts. I'd go again probably not something i'll go out of my way for."}
{"text":"Gonna give this place 4 stars because they were missing a couple things....  First let's start with the good... Me and two friends arrived about 10:30 or so on a Tuesday. It was just about $10 without drink and $12 and change with drink. Service was pretty decent, nothing to complain about there. My first plate had a sweet potato, a little bit of salad, and a couple deviled eggs, all which were pretty good.   Second plate had a piece of fried chicken and a piece of bbq chicken along with a mini corn dog and some cornbread with corn... or something along those lines. All of these were pretty good but the corn dog did seem a bit crunchy.   Third plate had some shrimp, some sweet potato casserole, some Bourbon chicken, and some meatloaf with mashed potatoes.   The sweet potato casserole was simply amazing, probably one of the best dishes I had for lunch, but the meatloaf was missing sauce..... it was still pretty good with some gravy from the mashed potatoes but I prefer the sauce that is supposed to come on meatloaf.   Desert plate: I was a bit disappointed because they usually have a chocolate lava cake and chocolate cream pie but I didn't see either. HOWEVER, the banana cream pie was amazing, and I did have a nice brownie with some soft serve ice cream, nuts, hot fudge, and whipped cream.  Overall I'd come back if I was in the area, but for the most part I'd probably stick to Old Country Buffet for similar food."}
{"text":"This place is an absolute zoo almost all of the time, but you can usually find just enough tasty food items to make it worth it. Staff service and be hit and miss. I've seen servers taking phone calls of their cell in the dinning room, but I'm sure they get peanuts for the work they do, so I don't hold it against them at all."}
{"text":"My 11yr old was clamoring for a buffet dinner and we were in S. Chandler... He'd never been to Golden Corral, so it was time, even though it was dinner rush on a Sunday night...  Sunday night is baby back rib night at GC.  We had to wait about 10 minutes to get through the line that started at the door.  Once inside, the food was simply edible.  I like their selection, they have more meat options than OCB, but nothing impressed me.  As usual, my kid spent more time with his ice cream cone with sprinkles, gummy bears, etc.  No complaints overall. It filled our tummies and fit the bill."}
{"text":"I dont know what the big whoop is about the place. The line is always insanely long. Prices are not that cheap and the food is bland and greasy. Compared to hometown buffet id rather eat at home town. Last night I was goung to try golden corral again until I saw the line was wrapped around the buildong going into the parkong lot. (Insane) I went to RedLobster instead and it was absolutely delicious. SKIP Golden Corral bland and not worth a wait."}
{"text":"Immediately upon entering the building, I was turned off by two things:  1. You have to go through a line with rails like an amusement park.  2.  As you approach the register..still in line.. you have to get your drink at the fountain.  It ends up the people drink what they initially filed up, then trying to go back you fill their cup again.  It was definitely annoying.  I was happy overall with the food.  A few highlights include the salad area & grill.  The salad area has tons of variety, and everything looked fresh.  I was also happy with the steak, as it was cooked to order on the grill.    My  only problem with the food was the catfish.  While the taste was okay, it was thin & bone-in.  So by the time I pulled the meat away from the bones, there wasn't much left. So I felt it could've been served better.    I agree with everyone on the cleanliness & service.   Getting refills on drinks and used plates cleared was a problem.  We could never seem to find out server; and other empty tables had plates stacked up for a while before they were cleared.  Food on the floor stayed there almost the entire time we were there, and the \"clean\" dishes & silverware had spots.  Sure, it's a buffet and I dint expect much, but for a place that is supposed to be a step up, I'd expect a step up.  Overall, I was happy & can see myself returning, but they can certainly improve on things."}
{"text":"I've come here twice, first time was probably all hype, cause the second time i came around it started to taste just like hometown buffet.  Basically thats all GC is , an improved upgraded version of hometown buffet. For around the same price, becareful at the door where they have beverages, they do charge for it.( a big more if you decide to grab the to-go cup as well)  Service is way above hometown buffet as they come by regularly , seem very sincere about serving and making your time there as pleasant as possible.  They do re-fill your drinks for you , unlike hometown which you do yourself.  The food there is pretty average-good the steak and salad bar are my favorites!  Go see for yourself and see what you guys think!"}
{"text":"This place always one of my favorite neighbors restaurant. Always enjoyed coming here, I believe I had my 7 year birthday party here.  Need more food places like Golden Corral."}
{"text":"Your location is about 45-60 minutes away from or home.  When we arrived we were told that this super long  line would take about 1.5 hours.  We then proceeded to wait from 5:05 PM to 7:40 PM, over 2.5 hours.  As waited to be seated a 5 year old girl vomited on the carpet in front of the food in about 6 places and the staff reacted slowly to getting it up.  I am sure you can imagine how terrible it would be to wait that long on Father's Day and then be just 3 feet away from that.  Once we were seated it took 25 minutes to get a glass of water and the BBQ ribs we came to get were never available after 6 attempts to get them.   I told the manager and he brought a TOGO box with a few ribs as we left the location for us, but that was a waste as we were not headed home and the spoiled.   The location was super crowed and the plates, cups, forks and spoons came out wet and some of them still had food on them.  We had to wait in lines for 5-15 minutes to get any food items.  It was a terrible experience."}
{"text":"Usually not my kind of place but they have great veggie selection for my son.  Being from the south it's a plethora of southern style food and great dessert. This place is clean!!!! The nice waiter who waited on us yesterday that has \"Prince in his name\" was wonderful.  Always a smile and eager to help.  Ask my son, we will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Never again will we go here or take or members here. The general manager was a rude as hell and disrespectful . The server there where also rude we where not done eating our food and the server took out plates when we where not done. They made it so uncomfortable for all of use to enjoy out lunch.  I five them please two thumbs down."}
{"text":"I dined here yesterday at noon, for the first time in quite a while. My experience was great in all respects. I tried several dishes and desserts: Steak medium rare with mushrooms and grilled onions/bell peppers, side salad w/Thousand Island, Salisbury Steak, Fried Chicken Breast (I ate Jalapeño Slices with it), Mashed Potatoes, Green Beans, Meatloaf, Fried Shrimp, Hush Puppies, Pizza. After all that (far more than I usually eat!) I had to wait a while before a few dessert indulgences that met expectations: Chocolate Cake, Banana Pudding, Peach Cobbler.  Lucy was my server, and she was friendly, attentive and kindly. I also had some interaction with Cat, and she seemed take care of her diners with friendliness and professionalism also. One of the other servers seemed a bit stressed and abrupt but oh well.  Given that it was a Sunday at noon, the place was very busy, and there were several queued up at the Chocolate Dip, yet everyone I interacted with was friendly and all too ready to lend a hand when I needed it (I'm disabled and use a powered wheelchair at places like this).  It's disappointing when other reviewers like Miss October 7th resort to such a scathing approach to try and knock down a well-established business. Don't let her dissuade you; it's a buffet, not a luxury five-star restaurant. If you like buffets, this one's very well run, and has several items to suit anyone's taste. I used to take my wife here fairly often while she was still alive, and we always enjoyed it. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I had seen several commercials for this place before I even knew it was being built in my area. SO I was hyped up about this place just by looking at the commercials. I went twice last week, not because I wanted to but I guess i had hyped it up beforehand too much haha. The first time I went on Tuesday at 1130am, I thought for sure there wouldn't be a line but yes there was a small 15 minute wait. The food was ok, much better than hometown that's for sure. Then we came on Saturday around 3pm, the line was about an hour and half. Luckily my brother-in-law was brave enough to wait for everyone. It was soo crazy busy, but some how the staff was still friendly and the managers made sure everything was running smoothly. The benefit of going for dinner is that they have made to order stations both steak and shrimp which was a nice surprise. I don't think I would go back for awhile until the lines are manageable and the buffet isn't as crowded."}
{"text":"I don't usually take time out of my day to make reviews but this has been one the worse meals I have ever over paid for!! Tea taste like cleaning solution, silverware nasty, carpet sour, hold building sour (even the glass over the food), table nasty, waiter slack. Really want my damn $15 back. Sick from the filth and over spending my damn hard earn money!! Don't go to Golden Corral S. Blvd Charlotte NC waste of $$ :("}
{"text":"i don't like writing bad reviews but this place just opened and you would think they would pay more attention to details like making sure the food was hot. it wasn't! everything was cold except for the milk which was warm. when you walk up they have a sign that says \"breakfast with steak\" total B.S. I asked where the steak was and they told me they only had steak with dinner! the sign said breakfast with steak. what are they trying to pull? do they think we are really that stupid? For the price you pay it is not worth it. the only cool part was that you can get cotton candy for breakfast. the plates are so small you cant get anything on it. maby that is their way of making us not eat as much. I was so pissed off by the end of breakfast I had to steal a bunch of fudge just to make myself feel better about getting ripped off by this place! believe me there are a lot of places in vegas with better quality and value. if you want a good breakfast, stay away from this place!"}
{"text":"Damn... Where do I begin? To make this review \"to the point\", I love the food here...PERIOD. The only problem I have is the amusement park line to get inside the place! No bullshit, I waited in line outside in the heat for damn near 2hrs. Yes, the line actually starts in the parking lot. Once you get inside, you'll be dodging unattended children at the serving stations like orange cones on a obstacle course! Other than the crowd, this is a damn good place to get a meal. My guess is that they didn't anticipate this big of a rush. But honestly, for the amount of people they get, they have it pretty organized. Bottom line, I love the place. But at the end of the day you'll find yourself not being able to have the best experience possible due to the overwhelming traffic constantly walking by your table. I gave it 4 stars since I genuinely like the place. I just can't deal with the crowds and kids set free to roam at will. In conclusion, your choices are, \"Do you want to wait? Or do you want to eat? (meaning going somewhere else where you can walk straight in... the choice is yours).\""}
{"text":"The myriad of food and dessert options alone makes this place a favorite with my kids and for the prices they charge, can definitely not be beaten with a stick of any size. I know, I tried!  Yes, the food may not be stellar, but it's a buffet. The food is edible and satisfying. Enough said.  Now on to the people watching....YIKES! Never mind, I won't spoil it for you with any further comments on that. You need to see for yourself.  The service is always very pleasant, so remember to bring cash folks. You can't tip with your credit card here and these guys work hard and put up with, well, refer to the people watching above. Just because you get your own food here, doesn't mean you clean up your own mess or should avoid tipping AT LEAST 10-15%!"}
{"text":"Had a bad experience before but my girlfriend wanted to visit it again. Gotta give them what they want Gave them another try, and oh boy I forgot how amazing a southern buffet is.  New management fixed this place up, but don't take my word for it, see it for yourself!! We'll be coming back   Try the mini cheeseburgers during lunch they are the best!!"}
{"text":"No. Just no.  My family was visiting and wanted to go to the golden corral because we used to go to one in Florida that was really good. This one was soooooo unbelievably dirty and disgusting.  I saw some pretty unsanitary things coming from the workers and there was food all over the floor. I'll be contacting corporate."}
{"text":"I must say. When this first place opened, we were soooooooo happy. It was definitely our go to spot. As time past, it's gotten worse. Yesterday,  we were there, we didn't get a single plate removed from our table. We didn't even get a refill on our drinks!!!!! They ran out of silverware and the food tasted old. I don't think I'd be going there any time soon."}
{"text":"I went here with my boyfriend and his family for dinner. When we got there, there was a very long line. When we got in, I was very pleased with the food selections. The ones that stood out to me was the steak (I had it in medium rare, yum!).   Oh, and don't forget about dessert! There's a chocolate fountain! Marcus and I got to make our own chocolate dipped strawberries. Also there's cotton candy!   TIP: I would recommend coming in toward the end of lunch, since you can stay for dinner. In essence, you're paying the \"lunch\" price for dinner. Your wallet and tummy will thank you for that.   I would recommend this place for everyone. :)"}
{"text":"I am being kind and giving 3 stars but I would really consider this more of a 2 1/2. Yes there is a lot of food and you can have as much as you want but the food is not very good. Every time we have been there we have to wait for a table to be cleared. I had family visiting who wanted to come here and probably won't return until they come back."}
{"text":"Prices are average for a buffet and there are some good choices. You get to seat yourself if it's not full. The last visit was the worst visit so far. Didn't like how two guy employees were standing by the drinks area gossiping in spanish. Annoying. Some of the food they were putting out was under cooked which is weird because it wasn't busy or full."}
{"text":"Lots of choices, really nice waiter staff, the staff behind the bar seem more not really caring about the customers on the other end they make it seem like it's a joke. Glad it's a fun atmosphere but I watch two guys not care what they say or how they act. Food 5stars, wait staff 5stars, cooks behind the counter 3 star."}
{"text":"Unfortunately my experience was less than pleasant. My sister bragged about the food at this place (not this location) so that is where we went. We tried a lot of different things and were all disappointed. Went on for dessert and yet again, disappointed. After siting and talking we went up to the front to complain. The manager came up and immediately had an attitude. Insisting that since we had been seated for an hour that he wouldn't refund the meal. Even though with proof of my receipt I can prove it was less than 45 mins.. I digress. I told him to ask his busser. We sent back pretty full plates of food each time. He then processed to get louder and louder and more and more irritated.. Arguing with me that I couldn't be unsatisfied because I sat for an hour and the food there is fantastic.. How much time I was seated is irrelevant. I sent back a ton of food because I was not satisfied. It was either under seasoned or over seasoned. He was very rude and tried to make a scene out of the situation. At the end of it all he said he couldn't refund my money that I would need to come back and talk to a different manager who had the authority. I am only driving through Vegas so I will be contacting corporate and will most definitely be contacting someone who has the authority to give me my money back!! I wouldn't make such a big deal about this had he not been so rude. I do not recommend this establishment. It is not worth it!!"}
{"text":"I usually don't review chains, but I've been eager to try golden corral for years. Everytime I watch ESPN or Fox sports they constantly have commercials about Golden Corral. The first thing I tried were the ribs. To give them credit, the ribs are tender and fall off the bone. But the meat itself is so fatty, it's hard to finish eating them-just way to fatty. Basically all the food is as flawed as the ribs, there's an upside and a down side. I'm being generous by giving them a 3 star review. Truthfully, it should be a 2 star review. There's no reason to wait an hour to try their food. I look back, and I can't believe I had hope. Is it better than hometown buffet? Yes, but not by much."}
{"text":"I came to the Golden Corral with my family on a Thursday night to beat the out-the-door line. We still had about a 15 minute wait until we finally reached our table.  The Golden Corral offers tasty food for a very generous price. It's about $15 for all-you-can-eat dinner and a drink. For my drink, I got the sweet tea, which I thought was delicious.  I was really impressed with the quality of the food. For the price we paid, mostly everything tasted great! The fried chicken was really juicy, as was the steak (mine was ordered medium well). Everyone wants steak though, so be prepared to wait in line for it. They had a lot of variations of chicken, (fried, rotisserie, BBQ, teriyaki) but I only tried the fried chicken, which was crispy and fully of flavor. The BBQ pulled pork was pretty good, too. I also liked the mashed potatoes and gravy. For dessert, of course I got the cotton candy! So good and a very generous serving.   As for my dislikes, I didn't care too much for the Mac n cheese; it was undercooked. The corn was seasoned well, but slightly overcooked; it was rather mushy already. I tried the pot roast, and it was still really dry despite it being doused in gravy. The southern fried fish was much too salty.   My biggest complaint would be with the lack of cleanliness of the facility. Our waitress was very nice and attentive, but her apron was really gross. Something was smeared across the front of it and it was crusted on there and looked extremely unappetizing. Normally I would be embarrassed to comment on that, but it really was not the greatest start to my meal to see that. Also there is a lot of trash and crumbs scattered all over the floor. I want to be understanding of them because the place is always reeeeally crowded, but it was simply unacceptable for my taste. It honestly made me feel a bit uncomfortable.    Overall, I had an okay dining experience at the Golden Corral because the food exceeded my expectations but I'm not sure I'll be back very soon."}
{"text":"It was ok considering the fact that I was pretty hungry.  The wait staff were really nice and considerate not to mention professional.  All-in-all, the food is good and the prices are good also."}
{"text":"This place is consistently good. It's a buffet so you kinda know what your getting into. There is a large variety of options to choose from. Their smoked meat selection is really good. I also like that you can go at your own pace and not have to wait for your bill. When your done you just get up and leave. Boom! Dinner is done.   If you are hungry and don't want to wait for food but also don't want bad food you should try this place. You may be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Food was all cold told the manager and she just checked the bottom of the food and she told us you took the food from the top and that was cold did not offer a refund"}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast on a Sunday morning with my wife. While the parking lot looked quite full, the restaurant was not. The only down fall came when we got inside. There was only one attendant taking drink orders and running the register. They charge extra for drinks so someone needs to take that order. They give you the appropriate cup or glass on a tray. When the same person does this and runs the cash register you get a backed up line. They could have just charged for the drink and let people take the appropriate cup or glass there at the register.   I was impressed at the selection of buffet items. Obviously I couldn't try them all. My top picks were Biscuits and gravy, hash brown casserole, the grilled Polish sausage. and the chocolate fountain. I didn't have room enough to try the fried chicken or the omelets they make to your order.  The biscuits were fresh and buttery. The gravy was thick, flavorful and loaded with sausage. This was one of the best biscuits and gravy I have had. I could make an entire meal of them. The hash brown casserole was very tasty. A nice combination of potato cheese and onion. They have a grilled Polish sausage or kielbasa that is smoky salty and juicy. This is a sausage cut lengthwise then grilled. There are real grill marks on the thing. The chocolate fountain was the perfect finish to the enormous meal. I dipped a Rice Krispy treat in the fountain. Yhere is a variety of fruit and other treats to dip.  Some of the less notable items were the sausage links. they had a funky taste. The corned beef hash tasted like it came from a can. The ham was a little salty, the bacon was tough and rubbery.   As I said, the selection was good and what I tried was either very good or average. I will add this place to my favorite buffets list for now. I will see what the lunch and dinner experiences bring."}
{"text":"- Line is ridiculous - price is ridiculous - pick drink, pay and grab your food (Soup planation is better)  what was the HYPE all about?"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. I came here yesterday for dinner and it was a completely different experience. I'm a chubby so I enjoy quantity and quality and yesterday Golden Corral was giving me both. I had three (don't judge me) plates of food and a dessert. My buffet style is \"a little bit of everything\" so I try to try a very small portion of what looks good to determine if it actually is good and if I want to eat more. In \"The Wok\" sections they had this orange chicken that actually tasted like oranges, but that's all you could taste, it was pretty gross. The egg noodles to go along with the beef stroganoff had been sitting in water for a while so they were very soft, practically falling apart so I didn't eat that either. The macaroni salad was really bland so I left that uneaten. The fried chicken was good, I'm not big on chicken so I only had wings. My first wing was perfect and then my second wing was overdone, not as juicy. My favorites were the steak (my fiancé's was medium but mine was well done so hers tasted way better), the corn pudding bread, the dinner rolls (with the honey spread), the  macaroni and cheese was good (although really soft), the mashed potatoes, beef gravy, and the stuffing. The stuffing did have a little bit too much salt. I like that they have actual ice cream and not just soft serve so I left with a butter pecan cone and a bag of cotton candy. It's definitely worth it for the price especially if you're really hungry or can't decide what you want because you can get a little bit of everything here. I would definitely recommend Golden Corral over Souper Salad or Old Country buffet but I wouldn't go back to any of those establishments for lunch."}
{"text":"Everyone was telling me about the Golden corral so I had to go try it out OMG I don't think I will never go there again that place was nasty the food was not good at all!!! I just ate some salad and that was okay everything else was not good at all.. So I had to go on yelp saying my opinion about that restaurant..  save your money"}
{"text":"It's nothing great but convenient the grilled steak is fresh fried chicken was good fried drinks weren't free 2.00 for a small cup and 2.49 for a large to go cup go for that. For dessert they have white chocolate fundue, chocolate fundue and caramel fundue,  cotton candy and ice cream otherwise it's not bad but definitely busy our server Steve was awesome"}
{"text":"My kids took me here on fathers day.    Very small Golden Corral to others I have been to.  Waitress was nice.  Buffet was  a mess.  Lots of food on the floor.  Lots of kids running around without supervison.  Lots of food items empty.   Pretty sad.   There are a LOT better buffet options in Las Vegas.  Will not be going back."}
{"text":"For a buffet the food way very good. The place was very crowded and extremely noisy. Value for money I think it was very good."}
{"text":"Have gone with friends to this buffet. It is good for what it is. But being a person with bariatric bypass, it isn't that good. You can't take what you don't finish home. It's great for people who like unlimited food also it's not a good place to go of your a vegetarian. Their vegetarian selections are limited to over cooked veggies and salad."}
{"text":"Food is good. Love the salad bar. Service could be a little better but I'll be back. A couple different things on the buffet this time, I like when places like this change it up a little bit."}
{"text":"Went yesterday 5-25-15 for dinner.  Man, was it crowded!!!   They don't have a military discount *sad violin noises*.  I've been to other GC's that offer it but this one doesn't.  Just sucks cuz' there's a military base right down the road and on FRICKIN MEMORIAL DAY they didn't even offer a discount.  Minus one star.    Have you ever seen feeding time at a pig farm?  Where the farmer pours slop out of a bucket into a trough and the pigs are all clammoring to get it?  That's kinda what it's like here, except great food. Super duper crowded and a rough crowd.     I had one of the best steaks I've ever had here yesterday!! It was about an inch thick and perfectly cooked, charred on the outside, and didn't even need a knife to cut it.  Sooooo good. Worth the $12 alone."}
{"text":"that's right, 5 stars.  now, BEFORE you go judging me, thinking I've only dined at places where you hafta pump your own ketchup, understand I'm not saying it ranks up there with Nobu, Ruth's Chris, or Chicago style- anything.  what I AM saying is that for the price, you CANNOT beat it!    I'll admit at first I was considering passing on the idea because there was a line out the door with, well, \"buffet people.\"  you know the type.  but buffets will always hold a special place in my heart; on special occasions, my dad used to take my family and all my friends out to the local spot when I was a kid; it's been very nostalgic ever since.  I know I'm not gonna get a bone-in cowboy steak cooked Pittsburgh style or a miso-blackened cod, but I think it was always the variety that I found appealing.  and at most modestly priced buffets, that's all it is.  very, VERY average food that looks like it should be served in a nursing home, with a crowd to match.  but this place was different.  yes, there was a line, but I soon discovered why!  the staff, while constantly busy and moving about quickly, was surprisingly courteous.  to whomever I asked a question, they stopped what they were doing and was very helpful.  now the real test - the food!  my first plate consisted of the usual supsects - mac 'n cheese (good), pizza (meh), fried chicken (surprisingly good), and a baked potato (decent).  overall, I was pleased with the first round, and the things I didn't like was not because they were cold (like most buffets), I just didn't care for the recipe.  and that's the thing about this place - the one upside to it being so packed is that the food never sits too long!  the second plate was even better - although I'm extremely weary of trying anything \"Asian\" at a buffet, I plated some of the teriyaki steak, which turned out to be very flavorful!  the lo mein was good, and even the sweet 'n sour pork was tasty!  skip the fried rice though.  another scary thing is that they asked me what temp I wanted my steak.  I had to hold back a scoff, but when I cut into it, I was surprised to find it was a true medium!  way to go GC!  then I stumbled on to two of my favorites - the seasoned hush puppies and the jalapeno cornbread.  they became my undoing.  I had another round of those and the piping hot, crispy fried chicken and I was DONE.    I was pretty disappointed I had no room for dessert - they had a good selection of cakes, pudding, cookies, and I was really curious about the chocolate wonderfall, but thankfully the cotton candy didn't take much space.  I left feeling the familiar post-buffet-shame, but this time, at least there was with a smile on my face.  overall, I spent $15/person for not only the incredible variety, but it was GOOD food!  plus I love that it was broken down into stations \"the grill, the wok,\" etc.  it was like a less pretentious version of Vegas.  they even had the cooks dressed up and preparing fresh produce by the salad station!  this place went above and beyond, and did not disappoint!  jalapeno corn bread, steaks cooked to order, tempura-battered onion rings, 6 flavors of ice cream at a buffet?  who does that??  def will be back, with reinforcements!"}
{"text":"Worst buffet experience in Las Vegas. Worse than the old Surf Buffet or the old Sahara Buffet! The place was absolutely filthy - at least a third of the tables had not been bussed or wiped. The food was terrible - dry and tasteless, It was also the most brightly lit restaurant I had ever been to. It was loud and wild children were screaming and running everywhere. As we left, we walked right by an employee, who looked at us and then turned her back on us without saying a word. Wow! There are so many good buffets in Las Vegas that I do not understand why anyone would eat here!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch w/ my folks on a Saturday morning at 11:15 AM - there wasn't a wait time and we were seated immediately!  By 11:30 we saw a line outside, so I'd show up early if you wanna bypass the wait.  NOTE - A lot of the stuff during lunch is limited, but for $8 bucks I really couldn't complain.  The salad bar had a few empty trays so they were missing a lot of the fresh fruits/veggies you'd probably get during dinner.  Additionally - the middle station only has chefs grilling the following meats 1) steaks, (2) mini slider-burgers and (3) liver (ran of fish when i got there).  I was hoping they could make full sized burgers or ribs or something, but nothing during lunch.   The steaks were a little too salty tho.    You can get other stuff like Asian foods (orange chicken, some stir fry stuff, fried rice, etc), general Mexican food like enchiladas & build your own tacos, and pizzas.  The desert section is pretty nice w/ lots of ice cream goodies & cotton candy.  Service is good too - they constantly refill your drinks and stuff.    I feel like people who are in buffet's automatically drop 15 IQ points and revert back to caveman status. It's like a freakin' zoo inside man. People will try to cut in line just to get their steak man; some people will bring 5 plates and grab 5 steaks at the grill, there was a mob of kids cutting just to get some cotton candy!  Crazy stuff goes down here man.    I'd like to come during dinner to get the full experience.... (and the full experience means dealing w/ the 'herd' of crazy people lol).     But still... 8 bucks for cheap eats lol.  I'd be back haha.  TIPS: -lunch specials are $7.95 Monday-Saturdays -Check your utensils when you eat. Not all of them are clean. Some of the desert bowls near the ice cream machine were dirty too."}
{"text":"$14 for an amazing buffet, filled with a real grill, a huge salad bar, Ice cream station with fondue fountain, fresh breads and biscuits, personal service at the carving stations, a huge variety of ethnic stations, and you can choose your own drink before you even reach the cashier!  That is what I'm talking about! Golden Corral is a league better than Hometown Buffet; and while not as amazing as some of the Buffets in Vegas, if you aren't actually in Vegas, then this is the next best thing. Extremely worth the money, especially coming with friends or family. Which is my only nitpick is that this place is too small! There seems to always be a line out the door during any normal dining time every day. The crowds leak into the buffet sections, and kids run around all the time. It's certainly a place for you to practice your plate-fu as you attempt to straddle and dodge the darting children and roving chains of people waiting for a fresh steak."}
{"text":"I went on Sunday for dinner and it was about an hour wait outside. For the price I guess the wait is ok.  But the food was surprising better than I expected...    Here some of the stuff they have...  The salad bar - the usual goodies and dressing. The Mexican section - Enchiladas, tacos, nachos, fajitas, spanish rice & a few others. The American section - Steak, fried chicken, grilled bbq chicken, poached fish, mac & cheese, corn bread & few others. The Asian section - noodles, mandarin chicken & a couple more I can't remember. Dessert bar - Fruits, cookies, brownies, pies, ice cream, chocolate fountain, caramel fountain & cotton candy.  Highlight was that the food was better than expected.  Overall, I'd probably come back but not if i'm starving lol"}
{"text":"Long line = good food? Nope. I don't know why people are willing to stand in line for a long time to eat at this place.  Or why is there even a line at all?  It's not even exactly that cheap either.  This place is really disgusting and unappetizing.  I only ate here because my parents had a semi-decent experience their first time so I thought it was worth a try.  Horrible mistake.   Atmosphere: Tons of people and kids running everywhere. I think it has to do with being located next to Speedzone and Round One.  This place is no where near being upscale or anything.  It's an American self-served buffet that lacks the aesthetic feature.  Even the dinnerwares are horrible. The dishes are not made of porcelain but probably clay with a glazed outer layer.  This produces many visible scratches which makes it look like you're eating off something you get at a 99 cent store.  I bet some of those glaze particles got in my food as well.   Food: Been to Hometown Buffet before? The food at Golden Corral is only slightly better, but only just by a hair.  They offered a bit more variety such as steak, buffalo wings, popcorn chicken, chocolate fondue, and cotton candy.  Sounds appealing, but they are not good at all.  All the food there are practically frozen food which were reheated.  To add more insult to this place, I found a RAW shrimp in my popcorn shrimp!  (I have uploaded a photo in their page).  And I already ate one too!  The only reason I was able to find out was because the outer bread shell cracked when I stabbed it with my fork.  Imagine if I hadn't.  Also I can't really complain about this since it's a buffet and not individually served restaurant.  Even if I did, they probably wouldn't do anything about it anyways.   Service: Slow service here.  We got our drinks after we finished our first plate.  I mean it's not like we're asking too much.  I think it is just common courtesy to get our drinks right away when we first got our tables.  It should be their first instinct.  I can understand that this place gets pretty crowded so they might have just forgotten.  But, I still find it a bit unacceptable.  I wasn't expecting great service anyway since it's a self-served place after-all.   I advise people to NOT eat here if you are looking for something decent to eat.  However, if you want to get stuffed, then by all means go here.  Just don't expect to be mind blown."}
{"text":"Wow!  I was definitely not expecting the food to be so tasty and fresh here!  I've been to quite a few buffets, both American and Chinese.  I have to say the selection and quality here is better than all the rest!  The dessert section alone is enough to get a person hooked!  This location at around noon on a Thursday was crawling with senior citizens with walkers, so don't plan to eat here on lunch if you're in a big rush.  The staff was extra friendly, and the food was all excellent!  I especially enjoyed the sweet potato casserole and the Chinese style vegetables.  The fresh bread and chocolate covered strawberries for dessert were really good!  I think I'll be coming back.  :)"}
{"text":"Awesome prices, delicious food. Everything was Great! Outstanding selections.  Staff were very nice and attentive."}
{"text":"One of the few places I eat where I actually enjoy my food. I'm a very picky eater and I really like this place. The food is good and so are the desserts and I feel like it's a good value.  Update: my previous good review used to be true of this place. Unfortunately the last two times I went it was very disappointing. Too much money for mediocre food."}
{"text":"Just your typical mediocre buffet and they're overcooked dry proteins. But they do have great dinner rolls"}
{"text":"Okay so, the food wasn't good at all. The mashed potatoes were super sticky, the steak tasted like armpit (not kidding), and the pizza was under cooked. The price seemed a little too pricy for crappy food... BUT the ice cream was good, plus the cotton candy, and chocolate fondue fountain were yummy. Although they took FOREVER to put out more strawberries. Out of everything, I really did enjoy the customer service the most. The waiters and waitresses were very attentive and kind. 5 stars for customer service 2 stars for food.   I would return but only during the week around lunch time to save money. It's just not worth $12 a person on the weekend."}
{"text":"I love buffets but this one is horrible. I received a page of coupons that made me go here. Tables are sticky. Plates are still dirty. The fruit & salad area had price stickers still on the food and nothing was cut up and prepared. The man working the grill section had no desire to help and was slicing the steaks in half to determine how cooked they were and then re-grilled them"}
{"text":"The buffet has hit full chain food restaurant status. I enjoyed some things here and hated others, Many people come here and many people are slobs! I watched has troves of over weight families pounded in and gobbled up all they can. Many letting their kids run around out of control, until the manager came over the loud speaker and announced that all children under 10 needed adult supervision at all times! (Clap, yeah, hooray!) The prices are pretty decent for this place (watch the drinks, they add up the bill) Many food choices, i tried several items..Meatloaf (good) Chicken (so-so) spaghetti (average) as for all the sides, they were all good too!  deserts are aimed more for the kids here but there was some good pie and ice cream. The set-up here is a little strange and seating areas can be cramped.  most employees were nice and helpful, a couple seemed upset with all the mess they had to deal with. Expect lines at dinner times & weekends. I can see myself coming here maybe 2 times a year, and i'm OK with that!"}
{"text":"All I can say is, it's a lot better than Hometown Buffet. The fact that yu can see your food while it's being made is a bit refreshing. At least you know where your food is coming from. Downside is that food tends to disappear as soon as its put under the heat lamp. Also the line reminds me of Disneyland. It's bad enough that the line is outside but it also zig-zags indoors. I paid around $11 for my meal because i added a drink to my lunch. Other than the line and disappearing food, the food is pretty tasty. I suggest getting their sliders and fried chicken. Also, you can never go wrong with a chocolate fountain. Never."}
{"text":"Last night the man serving the carved dishes was extremely friendly prompt and helpful.  This is by far one of the better buffets I have been too.    The waitress was a very busy bee but was friendly and tried her best to help all her tables w refills and cleaning etc.  The front cashier was new but seemed to be catching on very quickly.  We have tried breakfast, lunch, and dinner and have enjoyed all 3"}
{"text":"I don't know why they decided to put Vegas' first Golden Corral on the east side, more importantly right next to Home Depot. I guess the thought of buffet food and home improvement go well together?  Anyways, this place is always crowded with family and children. I mean most buffets are pretty loud, but if you're looking to stay away from a mass amount of children then try not to go here.  The food is alright. It's your basic buffet food - nothing really sticks out. They have your salads, soup, Chinese, American, etc. I did not enjoy the pasta here. It was too bland for my liking. The only good thing I had was the steak. I asked for medium well and it came back medium well with a lot of juice to it. They have a dessert section mainly targeted at candy like M&Ms and gummy worms. They do have a chocolate fondue fountain, but I stayed clear from that because the area was a bit too messy for my liking.  The part that grossed me out the most though is the workers cleaning out the food section with the same towel. You see them cleaning the section where the sauce from the pasta spilled and next thing he's over there cleaning the Asian section with the SAME towel - smearing food across. It just doesn't seem sanitary to me.  You can try this place out just to get it off your bucket list, but don't expect much."}
{"text":"Worst place ever.  I feel like I was at a homeless shelter. I don't try to sound like a rude person but this is my opinion about this place.  Food has no taste to it.  Service is bad."}
{"text":"I do not like giving 2 stars but I will say different locations are, well, different. The employees were wonderful let me say. However the food was just okay. There just was not a good selection. I don't expect high cuisine or anything but there was not a whole lot to choose from.   I will say for a lunch break we were able to eat lunch then go down the street and get milkshakes. eh honestly the one in university is really good, however I will review that one later.   Sorry guys, not a the best location, but if you want a buffet and in a hurry for lunch then at least try it. Maybe it's changed."}
{"text":"We visited Golden Corral for the first time, and overall it was okay.  We came to GC for breakfast as we were looking for a well open seated place for 9 of us and 2 babies, which there were many seats and tables we could choose from.  As for the food, it was okay.  They had the normal offerings, bacon, sausage, scrambled eggs, potatoes, etc.  They also had soups, an omelette station, deserts, and some Mexican dishes such as Pozole.  All in all, it wasn't the best food, but it was very passable.  In summary, okay food, okay service, okay prices."}
{"text":"We went at lunch on Friday and waited about 20-30min in line.  Too bad they don't serve steak and seafood for lunch, other foods are just ok, I'd give it 1 more star if when I come back next time after several months and won't have to wait half hour in line.  For lunch I would rather go to Asia Buffet, Souplantation or even Hometown.  - Chinese station       skipped because I've read the reviews on yelp plus it does look shady   - Italian/pizza station:       lasagna was good,       corn is good n sweet.      cheese macaroni was coated in the half melted cheese, looks nasty!   - Grill station:      love their BBQ chicken legs! very tender      pork chop was too salty      mini cheese burger - pattie was way too dry, over grilled/smoked  - Desert:      like the cotton candy and ice cream, but overall all the deserts are kind of low/cheap quality deserts: pies, puddings, cheap cake.  I was hoping to see some good variety of deserts like creme brulete, puff, cheesecake or even just cookies/muffins, but none of any of the above!!! But with this price range I guess this is it."}
{"text":"Horrible food! Nothing really out and workers have a attitude, don't wanna help you, or be bothered! Waste of my $14 what a mistake..."}
{"text":"Several members of my family and friends are completely obsessed with this place.  Ob. Sessed.    And so - I go.    Ya walk in, pay the lady and pick your drink.  Someone leads you to a table.  Shortly someone will be over with plates and rolls.  At that point - the feeding begins.  And when it ends is all up to you.  As long as you're there they'll keep bringing on the plates and more of their really good warm rolls with honeybutter.  Their steaks are surprisingly good.  You walk up to the window and tell the guy how you want yours cooked - he pokes around at a few and hands you a steak.  There are sauteed mushrooms and onions on the side for you to serve yourself.  Nice.    To give you an idea of the variety and the general immenseness of the place, I'm going to name of just a few of the things I saw there on just our last visit: BBQ Beef w/ opt Buns on the side, Tacos, Black-eyed peas, fried okra, pork & potatoes, steak, spinach salad, mixed green salad, chicken salad, fruit salad, ice milk, brownies, cookies, cakes, blueberry pie, bread pudding, chocolate pudding, cottage cheese, fresh melon (you can see them cutting it putting fresh stuff into containers), Fried clams, Fried shrimp, fried rice, fried chicken, mashed potatoes, and several soups.  It's so much larger than that sounds.  Servers are great at  offering new plates (dang food pushers) and refilling your drinks.  The place is also surprisingly clean.  It's nice to be able to see so much going on behind the counters - slicing the fruit, mixing things in bowls, decorating the cakes - it's all done right there where it's visible to everyone.  I've been told several locations out of state are much larger than this one - but I certainly can't imagine the need.    For about $10 a pop it is quite a deal for a great range of food that actually tastes good.  Come hungry."}
{"text":"Came to this location for the second try. First try was a fail. But I figured maybe we just came on a bad day. Turns out, second try was even worse!!   We got there a little after 7pm to celebrate my sisters birthday. I got a plate right away because I've been saving my hunger for this buffet knowing we were dining at a buffet that night.   Got up to the food and noticed, everything looked like it was sitting there forever! Only thing was good and fresh was, the steaks and fried shrimps. The soups were cold, the mac and cheese were super old!!! That's the only thing my son eats and he refused to eat it!   My brother came up to one of the workers and asked them if they can replace some of the food... because it was very room temperature and dried out. The lady responded \"I'll see what I can do\" and later returned and told us \"they are bringing out new food. They are just going down the line\" well, the Mac and cheese was never replaced. The guy came out and just stirred it up.  We watched him. They never brought out new soups either.   They were too busy cleaning!!!! They were already getting ready to go home at 730-8pm and they close at 9pm. Just ridiculous and disappointing. If they are gonna serve us old food, at least charge us half price....."}
{"text":"Lunch time last week. Decided to stop...because I wanted a casual sit-down restaurant that wasn't a bar or fast food.   MUCH better than my previous visit!  Food was still good. Service was MUCH better. Chris the dining room attendant was pleasant, attentive, and friendly. She was super."}
{"text":"The wait can get crazy at times but all in all the food and price is worth it. I couldn't get enough Steak which was a surprise seeing how this is a buffet. The shrimp was so/so but no real complaints. The teriyaki  chicken was great and I managed to make a incredible salad with what the salad bar had to offer with little creativity. With plenty deserts to choose from I gotta give this place credit and before I forget the have a military discount.  Knowaboutit"}
{"text":"We were there last night and a lot of the bins were empty, the lady tending to our table was sick and we were not impressed with the food. I don't usually have a complaint when I go to these places because normally they are good but for the price we paid and the service we got it could have been better. I will not be returning to either of them again because the one on Northern sucks very bad. Please do not allow your people to work when they are sick I can not afford to be out of work sick and I know a lot of people can not and well but she should have been working in the back or something not around people or food. There were six of us there and all of us were very angry that we were put at risk of getting sick."}
{"text":"ummm.. what the eff... How does this place have such a high rating? Did not live up to expectations. failed badly  So I was reading peoples reviews before I went here. I was pretty excited to get some steak and watch them cook it in front of me. But guess what?? This was no where to be found!l I told some friends that I went to Golden Corral and they did not have any steak and there response was \"then whats the point of going to golden corral.\" Lesson learned. I'll ask the people leaving if they have steaks. And the rest of the food is not even that good. Lacks flavor.  Service: It was alright.  Will I be back? Maybe. I might just go to hometown buffet or souplantation next time."}
{"text":"Golden Corral did not disappoint!  It was delicious, fresh and the quality of food beats Hometown Buffet or any of the other buffets around town hands down!  The dining area features an open kitchen where you can see the chefs and prep cooks hard at work.  The food selection is vast and I never expected to have a great buffet experience here.  We thought only great buffets existed in Vegas, but Golden Corral proved us wrong!    The wait times can be long, but it is definitely worth it.  I'd recommend going around 1:30-2:30pm, when the lunchtime rush is over."}
{"text":"We tried the Monroeville location for the second time in 6 months and suffice it to say, \"This place sucks eggs.\"  When we arrived most of the tables needed to be bused and even the clean ones had leftover food on them.  The food itself was less than appetizing, dried out and stale.  We love Golden Corral in Wilmington, NC, Williamsburg, VA, and several others, but this location is just beyond terrible.  I waited while the guy served ribs to a customer in front of me and then instead of serving me he walked away.  I waited and finally grabbed the serving tool and served myself.  He then returned, took the serving utensil, placed it out of my reach (along with the utensils for the ham) and walked away like he was angry without even asking if I wanted anything else (this was the chubby guy with a beard).  Most of the food on the buffet was pretty picked over (it was 7:30pm) so we grabbed what we could and left.  A waste of $28.11.   The one bright spot was Erica, our server.  She was very attentive and quite pleasant.  The other reviews and pictures here really say it all.  Management and ownership in this location should be ashamed of the product they produce.  F-"}
{"text":"felt like a big kids candy store. But still with lots of little kids running around. this place has only been open about 3 weeks so its still really crowded. Came on a Friday night for a later dinner at 9 and had to wait 30 minutes in line. I honestly expected more from the place..  the dishes were so so, but still better than hometown. Especially in the dessert section. They had red velvet cupcakes, the chocolate fountain, real ice cream (and a frozen yogurt machine), rice krispies, gummy bears, annnnd more. They had a little asian section and taco bar but I did not try either of those. Mostly pigged out on the steak, seafood pasta section, the southern goodies and of course dessert."}
{"text":"very busy place.  you have make sure you check your plate to see if it's clean.  I had got 4 dirty plates they still had some food left on them"}
{"text":"I don't know....what do you expect?  Dinner is $10.99 and your drink is extra.  My first round, I grabbed a plate from the stack and headed out for meats.  The wings were meaty, fresh, and...pretty good!  The steak was cooked as you like it and they'll cut it to prove it too, which I appreciated.  Ribs were fine, Pot-roast was fine, etc, etc, etc.    By my third trip, I was starting to loose the glaze from my eyes and I started seeing things as they were...average tasting food in a buffet.  The Chinese food was horrible (honestly, spit out horrible), the gravy is bland and the tortilla chips are greasy.    Overall, the buffet had it's hits and misses.  It was replenished often and nothing seemed \"old\".  There was a huge variety, but nothing really stuck out.  I did appreciate the desert bar which had a chocolate fountain and several flavors of ice cream.  So, what do you want.  It's average food.  High quantities.  Good service.  Fairly clean for the large quantities of food being passed around. You'll walk out waddling and feeling sick, but you did that to yourself!    4 stars is a valid score...even if it's just for the people watching!"}
{"text":"Well we went here tonite and I thought it was pretty good, it's not gourmet but it's decent food, maybe except for the meat. It was pretty tough chicken and steak. The shrimp on the skewer was delish and many different kinds of desert."}
{"text":"wish they brought the sea food that was prepared in front of you back. rest of food is decent nothing to great. get what u pay for. chocolate fountain is a plus with the fruit, candy and cookies you can dunk in it. new quesadillas are pretty good"}
{"text":"We will be back. We barely scratched the surface of this place, but we loved everything we ate. This is the best bang for your buck buffet, Bubba.  The very best thing is their Pan-seared Seafood which is prepared at its own station. I had tilapia on a bed of linguine with scampi sauce and it was cooked perfectly. They also had a choice of scallops or shrimp, with either a bed of veggies or rice, and either lemon piccata sauce or spicy alfredo.   Me Pan seared tilapia on linguine with scampi sauce 5/5 Garlic cheese biscuit 5/5 Green beans 4/5 Corn 4/5  Wife Clam chowder 5/5 Salisbury steak 5+/5 Bourbon chicken 5/5 Broccoli 3/5 Baked beans 5/5 Stuffing 5/5 Candied Yams 5/5 Baked sweet potato 4/5  Picky daughter Rotisserie chicken 4 Mac n cheese 4  All of the desserts we tried were a solid 4/5, but the fudge gets a 5/5 because, dude, It's FUDGE!"}
{"text":"This place was terrible food tasted like junk the cooks can't even cook a steak the food is frozen then reheated a lot half da buffet food was cold nothing look fresh and they charge you 13.00 a head wow how they get customers from da ghetto to eat there is unbelievable how does this place stay open can't they send someone from corporate like undercover boss please lol"}
{"text":"This was my first and last time eating here. The food was gross. The bbq chicken was cold. The dinner rolls were burnt at the bottom.  I just stuck to the vegetables I thought you can't go wrong with something that comes from a can."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful experience tonight at this Golden Corral, restaurant very clean, food was out of this world, and Don our server was just great, service was friendly from everyone. Glad I didn't pay attention to the negative remarks here. Great time. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"This place used to be a family fave but for over the years...it's wow factor has faded. The food has become average. The staff, however,  still remains to be friendly."}
{"text":"First plate of hash browns, smoked sausage, quiche were cold. No waffles to be found, but staff member had a plate full. French toast tasted like propane. Waitress was friendly and good service. Will not return for breakfast."}
{"text":"For golden coral it is the best one I've been too by far. Clean and well staffed. Food was fresh and good."}
{"text":"If  you enjoy massive quantities of mediocre to substandard food with nonexistent service, you will like this place.  I am torn between one or two stars, but will give them two.  This place just opened and so is cleaner than Hometown Buffet.    I hated the fat dried out steak that required a wait in line, bad popcorn shrimp, and the tough fried fish.  The fried chicken, barbeque chicken, and rotisserie chicken were blah, but edible.  Some of the food is mislabeled.    Dessert selection was poor with few choices for a buffet restaurant.  Staff appeared somewhat disorganized.  We arrived early, but had to wait in a long line.  The waiter took forever to pick up the used plates.  I sometimes find it wise to bus my own plates.  We had to get our drinks before paying, which really slows the line down.  You pay an extra $1.99 for a drink or even more for a drink to go.  They charge $5 per pound if you chose take out.  Pretty amazing just to sit there and watch people stuff themselves, but will pass next time."}
{"text":"Just a quick update to my review below:  My friend tells me that the first and only other Golden Corral restaurant that I went to and have fond memories of (Corpus Christi, TX) was relocated awhile back and that the menu has changed with the new move.    He doesn't like the food at all at the new Corpus Christi location and no longer brings people there.  His experience with the NEW location matches the one I had here at the Las Vegas location, so it appears that this isn't an isolated incident and the operation has probably changed nationwide."}
{"text":"Hi my name is Bruce Stegg, I recently  went to your restaurant it was quite good I liked the whole variety and selection of food that you have to offer for all ages. It is very friendly all the waitress are very nice, they are always there to fill your drinks it is very affordable. My wife and our four kids all went to your particular restaurant because we live right off of Gilbert and University. The line was pretty long once you actually got in to sit down and eat it took about 15 minutes to be seated, but besides that I really recommend this place to go eat. It is worth the buck especially if you have a big family the food for a buffet is really good they have a chef that cooks steak right in front of you to your liking. They are very clean they wear gloves for sanitation. I really like the fact that they where gloves, because you don't know the employee's wash their hands it's a good sign because; than you know that they prepare the food for you the right way by using the proper procedure that are followed by the health code. They seem like they know how to run a business. I like the fact that everyone is friendly and it is a good atmosphere for the whole family I would definitely go back to this location it was very affordable. All the kids loved the chocolate fountain their jaws  dropped to the floor. It was an awesome place to go for anyone to go you will be very pleased with the large variety of food that they have to display. They have a chef that cooks your steak right in front of you to your liking either you want it rare, medium well, or well done. Then they have some aju sauce that you can dip your steak in it is very good it is delicious. You would think being a buffet that the food would not be a high quality of food but it actually is really good steak, and the shrimp is fresh. They are very clean and sanitized I like the whole atmosphere I will see this place a lot to come in the near future. We literally were there for like two hours and they did not even try to rush us out. I thought it would be very hectic taking all the kids out to eat and that it would be expensive but it was not. I enjoyed it the kids loved it and after we were all done eating we went and played there stuff animal machine and won like six stuffed animals. It was really great service I will definitely be back, to this particular location. It was busy and now I understand why they are so busy they have great food that fits for your healthier eaters to the ones that just love to gore out on some amazing desserts and the endless amount of steak that you want to eat. All the plates are washed really well, you can use as many plates as you need and you don't have to worry about washing them after. So if you are looking for a great place to eat some great food and not feel rushed to get out the door than go to Golden Coral. It will be well worth the money I appreciate the management and all the staff that was working that day golden coral is one of my top places to eat."}
{"text":"Please don't ever come here! If you love your family do not eat at this place. First things first walking in is the horrible smell. It smells like the inside of a nursing home. No lie. Secondly they do not have a person coming around taking your dirty plates, they will sit on your table for a while in the way of your food. Third it's in the ghetto which would be okay if they had good food and customer service which they do not. Inside gives you the feel that a fight can break out and end up on world star and any moment. And last but not least when we were finished eating sitting and talking about how we will never come here again we see one of the workers cleaning the Buffett area and putting all the food that drops around the sides BACK IN WITH THE OTHER FOOD. I am so traumatized"}
{"text":"I am a fan of this place. Sure this is not the best  buffet in Las Vegas, but it is one of the better affordable ones, imho. I wouldn't run here at every opportunity but if I don't want to cook dinner, and we can't agree on what we want to eat - I would come here before I go another affordable buffet.  What I am a fan of:  *it is affordable. *food taste better than local stations casinos. *yeast rolls - AMAZING * food is always fresh. I think this is due to how busy they are. They have to keep putting out new product. *cotton candy     What I am not a fan of is how busy it is. *long lines (although they do move fast) *yes, i will cosign with everyone else - the entrance is horrible. It just doesn't work for how busy they are."}
{"text":"The food I really can't complain about, it's even good. The service is subpar, as we were sat at a dirty table, that we had to clean ourselves. The crowd...OMG the crowd! I'll never come here on a Sunday again. It's wall to wall people...and kids are EVERYWHERE! They had to make an announcement over the PA system about kids at the buffet bars alone."}
{"text":"Yo Golden Corral, nothing personal, but you don't live up to the hype. Being a vegas resident and seeing tons of commercials, I was expecting a flavor explosion in my mouth that would be not unlike the first time I heard the Beatles. The food isn't bad, but nothing that would make me drive the 20 minutes to come here. What I really do appreciate are the little things, such as the dessert fountain, and believe it or not i was mobbing down on the mashed potatoes. I give it 3 stars because I feel its exactly what it appears to be and it owns it. You need a quick, but filling meal, or you want a breakfast buffet. If everyone is in the mood for something different, then this all works out. The only thing that works against them in Vegas is that we are filled with buffets, so they stand out less and are graded a lot harsher. The servers are usually pretty nice, but of course I have had a few crappy ones. Overall its a very consistent restaurant that I don't have many qualms with. Come in, eat, then continue on"}
{"text":"It cost way too much, the food was awful, the place was empty and it was the dinner hour. Everything was deep fried, the ham was processed, there were different types of shrimp, but all deep fried, how much shrimp can you eat and it was way too much breading. I asked where the lemons were and when I found them they were frozen stuck to the bottom of the container, which shows they had been there a long time. I only had water and the waiter wanted a tip for the glass of tap water out of the faucet, not even filtered. I looked for butter but there was only margarine, finally after I was about to leave, I found the butter and it was in plastic tubs. The only good food here was Grandma's mashed potatoes, but the gravy was canned. Everything here was out of a can. The green beans were canned and burnt from the microwave. The cutlery was bent, the place was overly cold. The selection of food was limited. If I don't like someone I will tell them this is a good place to eat."}
{"text":"This place sucked big time I went there for dinner the food looked old as if it had been sitting out all day. The service from the staff working behind the food area were rude and inattentive they all appear disgruntled. The food was horrible even the salad section was bad. Only two people I encountered that day that appeared happy were the girl who took my money when we entered the building and the guy who took my plate everytime I finished. ***DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND SAVE YOUR MONEY***"}
{"text":"I can't believe this people  i paid to eat everything I want and the woman who cuts the meat serves small steaks!!!  5 big friends we were there. the service is bad never come back and I don't know the name of that Lady"}
{"text":"My recent visit to Golden Corral was great. My waitress Beatriz was very professional. The food is All-American. This includes an option to buy a beverage. 1 customer decided to switch tables and spilled one of her drinks on the table and chair. Beatriz, gave her a great smile and just cleaned it up. The only gripe is, getting used to eating and hearing nearby customers conversations...If that is a bother, make sure to bring some headphones and a music device. Other than that, the food was well prepared and in a vast variety. From a Salad Bar, Chicken, Meatloaf, Optional Steak order, Pizza, Brussel Sprouts. Truly a great experience."}
{"text":"GROSS. i will NEVER EVER come back here again!! go back to Hometown Buffet people seriously & i don't even like Hometown that much!"}
{"text":"great place, have been there more then once and each time it seam to get better, the gal that had our table actually served us, nice. asked if we wanted some dinner rolls and brought them to us, an glad she did they were great too."}
{"text":"Awesome buffet place! Most food is fresh and delicious The best: fried chicken, bourbon street chicken, friend rice, unlimited steaks, salad bar and their mexican beans and rice!  Service is just fine. They could improve on this by not rushing patrons to finish their meals fast and clean up tables without a notice.  Price is ok. Drinks should be included with the $12.99 dinner deal.  Only con: Long lines to get in on sundays between 12pm-3 pm (wait time to be seated could be between 15 min to 30 min)  Overall this buffet hits the spot. Forget about Hometown buffet once you try this place. I wish they had more locations in other areas."}
{"text":"Make sure your ass can stand about an hour just to get in."}
{"text":"This Golden Corral had food that tasted great just like the rest of them. Tons of food that just keeps coming. The only down fall of this place is that it just didn't have the clean feeling that the others I have been in have. And by clean I don't mean anything food related. The carpets seemed like they could be replaced and it just had a weird smell in the seating area."}
{"text":"This was my first time. I went with my family a party of 7 and first it was soo crowded the line was out the door. I felt like cattle in a barn. Once we got closer I saw there was another line inside it was loud and hectic. Needless to say we got out of line and went somewhere else. Didnt want to spend my Friday night at a Zoo"}
{"text":"This place is dirty.  The food has been sitting under the heating lamps for who knows how long and there are random kids just running around all over the place.  Never again my friend.  Never again."}
{"text":"Not worth 30 for 2 people. Place was kinda dirty. I mean they sat me next to the vacuum and across the restroom. Not to mention directly Under the ac I was freezing and my food was getting cold."}
{"text":"It's a good place to go if you want a buffet. I went for breakfast for the first time today and was surprised at the variety of food they offered for breakfast. I find that with their food items it's either a hit or miss. Some of the items are really good while others I can pass on. Overall the food isn't high end,  but if you want a buffet it's worth going to."}
{"text":"First time.  Not bad. But not good either. Sunday paid extra cause it's Sunday menu. Advertised ribs and breaded shrimp. Manager said that this location is diff from that on tv. The steak was good. Waitress was friendly and always available to fill my drink. Over all, ok. Don't think will be back."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of buffets. Not because of bad food. Because there is to much there to eat and I eat more than I need.  It was my Mother In Laws birthday. This is one of their favorite places to eat. We are all seniors and the food is very affordable and the food is good. Oh and you can stuff yourself so you are sure to get your moneys worth!!  This time we had a lady that took care of our table. Her name was Linda.  WoW!! The best service I have had anywhere. She was great. Always there to remove plates and fill your glass and coffee after the meal. I do hope you have the pleasure of having her for your table waiter when you eat there.  I started to watch her. She was moving faster than anyone else by at least two times. Never a waisted moment. She was giving every table she took care of the same attention she did us.  Because of this service I went to talk with the manager as we left to let him know what a star he had in Linda. I also wrote a letter to their corporate to let them know.   We often easily write about good service and bad service.   When we get bad service? Some of us will tell the management. Some of us will just not return. I may do both or neither.   I do tell the management and write letters when I get great service.   Remember Enjoy"}
{"text":"For a buffet this place is pretty decent. We went for breakfast. There was typical and some not so typical breakfast fare. Pancakes, fresh made waffles, eggs, bacon, sausage, ham, fruit, made to order sirloin steaks, hash browns, biscuits and gravy. There were also some lunch items and salad bar.   I personally am not big on buffet type restaurants but it is a good choice if you are going to go to any buffet. Everything was fresh and the waitress was attentive and brought us drink refills and cleared our plates frequently."}
{"text":"One star for the waiters because thats all this place has to offer.  I went on a Friday around lunch hour just to hear a cook talk about how he doesnt know what he's doing and the fact that he's never cooked in his entire life. I looked over at my mother and told her \"and thats why our meat is so tough and burnt\".   Every time i get up to get silverware, i have to search and search for clean spoon or fork. Its like they dont wash them off before putting the it in the dishwasher. All of them typically have food particles caked on. I eventually started to bring my own forks from home when my family and I go here.   The salad and fruit bar is miserable as it is at every buffet. The desert bar looks delicious but the flavors are not there. To be honest, it taste like their cake came out of a health factory with its bland artificial flavors. Never get banana anything since you'll most likely catch a bad case of the runs. Their pizza use to be okay. I just happened catch the bad day where it was burnt. You know, thanks to \"the man who signed up to cook with 0 experience in the kitchen.\"   The bathrooms are disgusting. Everything had piss all over it and the sinks were horrifying.   Never go to this place on a Sunday. You wont walk 4 steps without bumping into someone."}
{"text":"The buffet wasn't well stocked at all.  Stopped in for a quick lunch- and at 2pm they still had breakfast items out.    Next time I'll just go to elsewhere.  Anywhere- Impossible to eat healthy for sure."}
{"text":"Eh what can I say it was a buffet... exactly what I come to expect. I do come here often so it is good enough to bring me back. But nothing I am going to jump up and down raving about either."}
{"text":"Food is good. Service is terrible. Our group of three arrived at about 4:10 on a Tuesday. One disabled person (me)and two others.  One of our group volunteered to wait in the line while the other person helped park and get me inside. They have no disabled  accommodations.  The person in line was going to buy the dinners for all three, but was rudely told that he could only buy his own meal because the other two people in the party were not in the line.  This forced me to wait in line because it was their policy. They would not explain their policy or offer any suggestions  This  is vegas and fortunately competition from the casinos offers cheaper prices and much better service for guests. I suggest that retired and disabled persons just not patronize this place. I won't go back for sure"}
{"text":"As far as American buffets are concerned, this place is always pretty flavorful. I mean you can't beat green beans that are seasoned and have bacon in them...most places just throw out cans of vegies and heat them up. The rolls with the honey butter are always to die for. Yes, tons of same ole same ole with fried foods and pasta/pizza, but they do have steak too and it is usually pretty good for the price.   Cons:  I say this with all hope of Management at some point reading it. The chocolate fountain...needs to go. Yes, it looks cool and people love it, but I have never sat close to it before until last night and this is what I saw in just an hour. Two little boys were going up to it and putting their fingers in it...then licking them, then doing it again...no idea where their parents were, they looked 7ish and 4ish. Then a little girl around 7-8 alone again, came with an ice cream cone and dips it in...losing the ice cream in it. After her, a 10ish age girl comes and dips a berry on a stick, eats it and then continues to put the stick under the fountain, licking it off the stick...over and over for the hour. I am a Nurse, so this made me cringe. I wonder how many viruses and contamination are in this fountain? I will never eat anything from it and if you are a parent...don't let your kids eat from it. I watched it get cross contaminated about 20 times in only an hour. So, who knows how sick it could make you. And, finally shame on parents now days for letting their children scream an run wild in resturants. If we could all manage the task when we were children to sit at the table and eat politly, your chilren can too. Managment, should really inforce, no children running around unattended. Not that it would have helped the girl redipping the stick and licking it, as her mom sat on her ass and watched her do it over and over. Yeah, she would tell her to come back to the table...but never got off her butt to make her."}
