{"text":"If you like breakfast then this is your place.  For under $18 (tax included) this buffet is amazing.  Coffee/tea and juice is included.  They have high quality fruit and pastries and all the other usual things, but they also offer \"other\" items on the hot food line. Besides the eggs, bacon, sausage and breakfast potatoes they also offered two surprises. Yesterday was a chocolate crepe and an egg frittata. This morning it was ham,egg,Swiss cheese croissant and warm cinnamon buns.  The wait staff is exceptional and only to willing to please.  If you are a breakfast person or you eat lot, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"They are either hiring the right people or training them well. Staff is so friendly and falling over themselves to please. Especially, waiters Josh and Christopher, and Hostess Sonia.  The tapas dinner is OMG quality. I can't try anything else cuz I'm addicted to the jalapeño bacon wrapped shrimp and the mini lambchops.  Served cleanly and beautifully with excellently prepared broccolini.  So surprising for a hotel restaurant.   Love the fireplace outdoors."}
{"text":"Well done dining!  Menu was creative based on a local theme.  Tasty, but conventionally prepared.  Service was pleasant and knowledgeable.  Service was genuine and relaxed, with a sense of humor.   Even though this place is part of a large hotel resort chain, it has a light, local touch.  The outdoor patio is peerless with local landscaping, pools and fountains. Has piped-in music, but at a low, no distracting volume.  Some Live music, like solo guitar or small Ensemble would make the ambience world class.  This is a place to go along a strip of resorts."}
{"text":"Rare that an average hotel has an excellent restaurant, but that is certainly the case here. The servers were friendly, helpful and attentive. The ambience was very good and so was my lunch. I wanted something that wasn't too big, so the server suggested the steak taco trio -- which was just the right size and an excellent choice. Everybody in our lunch party was pleased with the food and service. Thumbs-up!"}
{"text":"The night before Thanksgiving is when restaurants can get a little busy because nobody wants to cook. I had recently purchased a card that allows you to receive one free meal with purchase of one at 29 restaurants in Arizona. You are allowed to used the BOGO deal two times at each place. My boyfriend and I did not bother looking at reviews or anything of that sort. We picked a place out of the list and it happened to be this place. I called and made a reservation because the instructions are the card are to do so. I believe the lady on the phone is also the hostess at the restaurant and she was super friendly. When we got to the restaurant, my boyfriend wanted to just get a drink and then leave because there was only two other tables there. I convinced him to stay and order a meal but now I sort of regret that decision.   I'm giving it three stars because the service was decent and I hate giving a bad review based on one experience. Honestly, I would give it 1 and a half if I could. There was one server running around, one hostess, and I believe one busboy (that did not really speak much English). We shared the AZ Chopped Salad which was just okay and then I ordered the Sea Bass and my boyfriend ordered the filet mignon. Both of us were disappointed with our meal and did not even eat half of our dishes. The fish was over seasoned and then topped off with some sort of picata. The arancini that came with my dish was cold and tasteless even though it sat in a dish of tomato sauce. The steak had some sort of \"beer maple\" reduction and to simply put it, it was BBQ sauce. Who puts BBQ sauce on filet mignon? The busboy asked if we wanted any boxes for our food and we said no. He didn't ask if we enjoyed it or not. I had a glass of wine and my boyfriend had a martini. Our table was next to their breakfast buffet set-up and I bet you it is probably better than the dinner. It's going to take a lot more than a new chef and a new menu to bring in more than a few tables a night of people who are 65+ years old. There is potential but I doubt the hotel will do anything because it's good enough for mediocre hotel room service.   Two meals, one salad, and two drinks. With our BOGO card and gratuity added, it was a $93 meal that we pushed around our plates. With so many great restaurants on that restaurant list, I was surprised this one made it on there."}
{"text":"We've been to En Fuego three times and practically had the place to ourselves, which I don't understand because it's ambiant, the service is great and the food is exceptionally good. Husband enjoyed his tapas of short ribs and shrimp; the broccolini was perfect -- bright and crisp. As a vegetarian, I get a little tired of pasta with vegetables, but all three times, the chef (last night it was Victor) has oblingingly made a vegetable plate that is a delectable work of art. Garlic mashed potatoes with perfectly grilled roma tomatoes, eggplant, zucchini, young asparagus, and a peppery red onion. Rebecca played the perfect server, attentive but not hovering, polite and amiable. She responded to every thank you with \"my pleasure.\" Indeed, the evening was OUR pleasure."}
{"text":"I... think this restaurant is either being merged into Asadero Cocina + Cantina or removed or something? We were here for a conference this past weekend and had our dog with us so couldn't really eat out, which meant a lot of dining in at the hotel. We tried finding the physical restaurant and didn't see it anywhere. Maybe we missed it? The room service menu included \"En Fuego\" items, such as the burger, and none of it was more than your typical hotel food.  The burger, while I asked for it well-done, was pretty much fully dry and charred on the outside. I don't dare eat a medium rare burger at random places though. Fries are frozen seasoned fries (yanno those signature curly fries coated in some sort of seasoning? same thing but not curly!).   We tried the corn quesadilla with chicken and it wasn't bad. It came with a little boat of salsa that you could dip the quesadilla into. I didn't like how much onion there was compared to cheese/corn/chicken. It's cooked on a corn tortilla and cut into quarters. Overall a hefty portion.  My fiancé had their prickly pear chicken sandwich one night and pulled pork sandwich another. The chicken sandwich was good although it was seriously falling apart with the slices of avocado on top. The aoili was a little too sweet for my taste. I didn't try his pulled pork sandwich because it looked like dry pulled pork smother in bbq sauce. He said it tasted alright."}
{"text":"The dinner tapas are fantastic! Try the bacon wrapped shrimps, scallops and out of this world lamb chops! Seriously, they must put crack in their lamb chops because I want to come back to Phoenix just to have them again!"}
{"text":"food here is very good; the appetizers, especially the bacon-wrapped shrimp were well done, cooked perfectly.  sandwich menu has a number of good selections, and the lamb chops were excellent.  why three stars?  the abyssmal wine list.  charging $9/glass for a mediocre wine that retails for $13/bottle is ridiculous.  Would be nice if they could bring their wine list up to par with the food.  Will go again, for the food, but it's a bit of a shame, because a nice wine would pair well with their offerings."}
{"text":"Okay, I don't get the hoopla.  Tonight we went there based on yelp reviews. We started with a caesar salad and charcuterie board...the latter included bologna!!  Okay, the bologna had pistachios, but really...bologna?  The salad was okay, not particularly fresh, certainly not memorable.  After one bite of the bologna, my stomach started cramping.  I felt ill and no longer wanted an entree.  My husband was in the same boat, felt the exact same way.  The good news, our daughters grilled cheese made her happy.  The service was fine, not great, not poor.  We got our bill and left.  Likely not to return :-("}
{"text":"En Fuego, located inside the Doubletree Resort, is best known for its great buffet breakfasts (06:30-10:00), but we just tried it out for dinner and were not disappointed.  The decor is up-scale, and since there were only four other customers on a Sunday night, the service was great.  The wine list is a bit pricey but agreeable.  Don't expect exotic new cuisine, but the staples were all right on target.  There's a variety of tapas such as jalapeno-bacon-wrapped shrimp as appetizers, and the entrees are classics such as Delmonico steak, chicken breast, char, and a seafood medley.  We had the lamb chops and the pasta with spinach and mushrooms and both equaled anything we've eaten in the valley.  The former came with broccoli sauteed to perfection and an excellent butternut squash risotto.  We also enjoyed the chocolate romance for dessert."}
{"text":"I started coming here when my Grandparents were staying at the hotel due to a flood in their house.  We went to the restaurant and were throughly impressed by the menu selection (everything from short ribs that should be award winning to garlic crust pizza and quesadillas) to their staff and the ambience of the bar area.  The staff are more than willing to make any changes to orders and always do so with a smile.   The menu has something for seriously everyone and I have NEVER been disappointed with what I've ordered.   Quality ingredients, variety of selection and friendly staff= perfect dining experience!"}
{"text":"I attended a training class at this hotel and didn't have car since I didn't really need one. I figured after checking out their website it was safe to assume I could eat well at the restaurant and snack bar for 3 days. I was correct! I love En Fuego! I had the same entree all 3 nights because it was amazing! The Grilled Salmon Ceasar salad. I did venture out during the day and ordered the AZ Chop Salad and I enjoyed that too.  I have a bogo coupon from the Entertainment Guide that I plan to use soon so my other half can experience the tastiness! I love the al fresco seating with the fire burning at night. Very lovely setting and the service was fantastic."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of breakfast, so on occasion will drive over to one of the top Scottsdale resorts to enjoy my favorite meal. Last Saturday my wife and I dined here, we have been 2-3 times before and always enjoy the experience. It's now cool enough to be able to site outside, but we voted to stay inside this visit. The services is good & friendly, I went for the buffet as usual, it's nothing spectacular, all the usual suspects and my wife enjoyed the Eggs Benedict. The foods was good and I was pleased to see how often the staff checked on the buffet food to ensure it was hot and plentiful."}
{"text":"enFuego is now called Asadsro.  Unbeknownst, there was a management change 3 days ago.  Staff are polite but apparently untrained.   The cheesesteak sandwich lacked flavor and was greasy. But it arrived with a generous side of amazing french fries.  The Prarie Chopped salad was fresh and had good flavor.  The half baked brownie was average and they were out of vanilla bean ice cream. It was not the same with strawberry that seemed to have ice crystals.  As the restaurant got busy, service began to suffer considerably.  Nice setting, good ambiance could not over one the defects. Perhaps new management will get it together one day."}
{"text":"We were staying at the hotel and decided to try the breakfast buffet one day.  The buffet has both hot and cold items and a pretty good variety of things.  I was surprised at how good some of those things were considering how rubbery the pancakes can be at a buffet.  The other thing I really liked was that you can put in an order for eggs any way you like them with your server.  The fruit was very fresh and everything was kept nice and clean."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for lunch and it was plain jane. The girl that seated us had a bit of an attitude but both the server that brought us our drinks and the man that took our order were the exact opposite. They were helpful and friendly.  The speed of the service was great and the food came quickly. The reason for the low rating? It has to be because of the prices vs the food. I think $12 for what is essentially a deli sandwhich ( I had the smoked turkey and hubby had the egg salad) is way too much. On the plus side the fries were really yummy.  Maybe we will try once again but this time for dinner to see if they have a better quality."}
