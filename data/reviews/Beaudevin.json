{"text":"Always the Best service and food. Yes You may pay 2 dollars more overall but no crowds, noise or feeling rushed. I love this little find"}
{"text":"This is definitely my new favorite airport restaurant! I ordered a farmhouse salad & Scottish smoked salmon tapas plate, along with a 3oz pour of Sauvignon Blanc just to have something to sip on. The farmhouse salad was refreshing & light, but with punches of flavor from the goat cheese & crunchy texture from the pumpkin seeds. The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of were the beet spirals in the salad -- it would have been awesome to have roasted beet chunks instead, but w/e, just a minor detail.   I really loved the smoked salmon tapas, which came with 4 rosettes of salmon, each with 2-3 slices of salmon rolled up & bits of capers, onions, & microgreens, all dressed with some creme fraiche & a light white sauce. There was plenty of flat bread to stack the salmon onto, it's so nice when a restaurant provides you with adequate bread/crackers!   I guess the prices are a bit expensive, but considering that a mediocre & skimpy smoked salmon bagel might cost $13 in your typical airport, I'd much rather spend a couple dollars more to eat a high quality meal at Beaudevin. I'm counting down the days to when I fly back home from my business trip, so I can make another trip to Beaudevin & try the flight of NC wines!"}
{"text":"Surprising great food in an airport with reasonable price. I tried their chicken tartine and green apple salad. Both are excellent. The bitter and hearty arugula leaves are balanced by the sweet granny smith apple and Spanish bacon. The crunch texture from roasted almond and julienned apple make the salad very pleasant to bite. The grilled chicken on tartine is so juicy. I was expecting card board dryness like most airport vendors, but the grilled chicken is pre-marinated well and grilled very right. Excellent service and atmosphere. The friendly waiter told us the apple is from DC. We don't have so sweet green granny smith apple in California. Maybe the earth in DC is somehow more suitable for growing apples."}
{"text":"Decent enough but the prices are outrageous. Wine mark up at least 4x! Only stopped since I can expense it."}
{"text":"I got the salmon sandwich and cappuccino. Everything was excellent, the waiter was friendly, and the atmosphere was very relaxing. I wish more airports had places like this."}
{"text":"We just had the best meal we have ever had at a restaurant in an airport anywhere in the world!!'  Yes it's that great... A wine bar? Yes but the food is surprising. And believe it or not, the atmosphere has a very cool vibe and can even be romantic with the right person. And yes... It's in the Charlotte Airport!"}
{"text":"Nice upscale place to stop in the airport to have a glass of wine or cold beer. I had the goat cheese and tomato bruschetta. It had good flavor and the bartender was very nice. Great service! If you enjoy reds you'll definitely enjoy the Biltmore Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon. It's one of the local wines on the menu."}
{"text":"Best way to wait for a flight! Servers are attentive, food is delicious, and feels like you're not even in an airport.  Did I mention the wine list? Don't miss this stop on your next trip through CLT."}
{"text":"A gem! Tucked away behind the hustle and bustle, this lovely spot serves typical airport fare but with amazing southern hospitality. A good wine selection but the service and inviting atmosphere are what sets it apart from other options in CLT. Keena is on her game and makes you feel special. A must stop for road warriors."}
{"text":"Totally mainstream wine list. Nothing interesting even though the menu has sections like \"Interesting Reds\" & \"Interesting Whites\". There was nothing on the list that you would not find in your average wine store. Largest flight pours I have come across. I want to taste not guzzle. Add to that the price and I know who Beaudevin is trying to emulate but they have a long way to go."}
{"text":"This place is nice and comfortable. I had really good pesto chicken flat bread with a glass of chianti. They have great selection of wines and prices are by oz."}
{"text":"Quick pours of wonderful wine, and perfectly portioned tapas. Hat tip to Jimmie for fantastic service"}
{"text":"Very slow service.  The jumbo shrimp for my spinach salad were smaller than my finger. Given the price, I'd probably not dine there again."}
{"text":"They have these in a few airports. If the one you are stuck at has one, I suggest you stop in for an app or meal with a nice glass of wine. They are fairly quick in service so no worries regarding time. The one here is at the end of the food court. I like their open faced herbed chicken sandwich. Pairs well with their recommended La Crema Pinot Noir."}
{"text":"At the outset, I want to say that this four stars as airport restaurants go. I would not otherwise go here. It is, however, the best place to eat in CLT.  I've eaten two meals here in the past three days.  Lunch: an open-faced salmon sandwich, caprese salad, and iced tea. (No wine.) It was perfectly tasty. Service was prompt and friendly. The bill came to about $30--expensive generally speaking, but worth the money for a healthful airport meal.  Dinner: an open-faced chicken sandwich, a cheese plate, and iced tea. (Again, no wine.) The chicken sandwich was OK. The cheese plate had dried fruits, nuts, and a tasty selection of four cheeses (three soft, one hard), with quite large chunks of cheese. Mysteriously there were neither crackers nor bread, but instead a few triangles of pita. Spreading brie on pita was a strange experience, and not a particularly tasty one. (I suspect that the late night kitchen staff just isn't aware of how soft cheeses are generally served or consumed.) I quickly ran out of pita, and found myself just shoveling soft cheese into my mouth with my fingers. Again, service was prompt and friendly--especially for 10:15 at night--and the bill about $30.  I'm not in love with Beaudevin, but I hate every other food option at CLT--everything is greasy, reheated, meat-and-bread-laden fare, with hardly a fresh vegetable or fruit in sight. Sure, it's HMSHost-owned and -operated like every other restaurant in the airport, but even given that, Beaudevin is a breath of fresh air."}
{"text":"I stopped by here briefly while waiting for a flight out of Charlotte.  So glad that I got to the airport early for once in my life!    The wines are priced by the ounce and are offered in both 3 oz and 6 oz sizes which is nice in case you are short on time and don't want to gulp down an entire glass in a hurry.  I ordered a full pour of the Malbec along with a salad containing beets, goat cheese, and pumpkin seeds that came with a lemony vinaigrette.  The bartender gave me a generous pour and the food came out quickly.  The salad was good- my only issue being that it had shaved beets which I feel don't really count as beets given that you can't taste them.  However, this was outweighed by the ample serving of goat cheese on top.   Service was friendly and speedy; I suppose you have to be given that a lot of customers are likely on a tight schedule.  The menu has a lot of appealing small plates/dishes on it including a cheese/fruit/nut sampler, charcuterie sampler, hummus dip with veggies and baguette, crab cocktail, and a variety of sandwiches which looked great.    If I am ever in the Charlotte airport in the future I will make sure to set aside some time to visit this place again!"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise at the airport! I'm glad we read the reviews and chose to eat here. If you have any time at all to get more than fast food, check this place out.  I can't speak for the wine since we were not drinking today, but the food and the ambience were well worth the stop.  If you have kids that are decently behaved, don't hesitate to bring them. There isn't a formal kids menu, but he servers are accommodating and will make grilled cheese and fruit plates for them and don't give you that crazy look because you brought a kid there.   We tried 2 of the salads - and you can add protein too if you like. We also tried the turkey rueben recommended by another review and they were excellent! So nice to get something other than fast food at the airport! It was also somewhat secluded and thus quieter than the rest of the airport. A great break for our trip."}
{"text":"No place better to eat in CLT.  The open faced sandwiches are perfect before a flight and the wine list is solid.  There's a nice atmosphere and the clientele is mellow (a major plus in a busy airport)."}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended, and with a 4-plus star rating.  I'm not sure why.  I sat at the bar on a Sunday just after noon, and waited for 5-10 minutes to be acknowledged.  The bartender was abrupt and uninterested, but I was hungry.  I ordered the chicken pesto flatbread and was very disappointed.  is was soggy, flavorless, and the chicken tasted like it was previously cooked and then frozen in a factory - I bet there's a big plastic bag of it in their freezer.  That and a soda cost $19!  The bartender never checked on me once, and then disappeared for 10 minutes while I waited with my credit card in my hand.  Fail."}
{"text":"Nice location, sat on a couch overlooking terminal.  Carolina wine is a little dull and sweet for my taste but worth a try.   Scottish salmon open faced sandwich is a winner. Quite filling. Beautiful combination of raisin bread and salmon and some creamy sauce. Also micro greens, capers, and an onion. A winner.  Would def return to eat here on my next layover."}
{"text":"Shrimp Scampi is delicious. And I eat a lot of shrimp. Liquor selection is a little slim but not too shabby."}
{"text":"Food is good - I'm in this airport often - but the service is awful. I'm sitting here now and it took 20 minutes to acknowledge me and take a drink order.  It's an airport people,  pick up the pace and stop chatting uo other employees."}
{"text":"Beaudevin has the best atmosphere in the Charlotte airport and is always my favorite place to stop.  There's lots of healthy menu choices and the food has always arrived quickly. Hey, if you want to indulge there's always Cinnabon next door!"}
{"text":"Consistently best choice for non-fast food once past TSA in CLT but service is consistently shabby. In other words unless you have plenty of time, don't try and sneak this in before boarding."}
{"text":"Great Atmosphere! An irresistible eye teaser. A great selection of premium wine and food choices. The cheese plate is delicious!"}
{"text":"The grinder was tasty but mostly bread - very skimpy on the meat. Wine disappointing and service forgettable. Forever to get water refilled and check"}
{"text":"Every time I fly out of CLT, I get a bite to eat and a glass of wine here.  The smoked salmon sandwich is really tasty and their breakfast options are solid. The service is attentive and friendly. It's not cheap, of course, but for airport food, it's pretty good!"}
{"text":"This a great place to stop for some food before boarding your flight. Fresh/healthy options. I had a grilled chicken sandwich and their meat and cheese plate. So good. I even got to select the meat and cheese I wanted!! Had a nice glass of Chardonnay. Great service. Will stop here again"}
{"text":"For those of you having trouble finding the place on the map like me, it's in the central food court area, right next to the Cinnabon. Maps should have a numbering system, not \"it's one of these 30 purple dots!\"   Decent steak sandwich. Nice ambience.   Service felt slower than it may have been.   Recommended if you've got time and an expense account, otherwise you may want to start somewhere else. Assuming you can find it."}
{"text":"The smoked salmon sandwich was excellent, an interesting twist on pecan raisin bread. This would be five stars anywhere, yet this is in an airport. Impressive!"}
{"text":"Ok. You're looking for food in the airport. I mean real food. Not fast food. Check this place out. Great menu. Wonderful ambiance. You sit and really enjoy.   The servings are generous. Beautiful. I suggest a nice wine and artisan cheese plate. Then look at the dishes. Can't go wrong"}
{"text":"Good but pricey selection of wines  Good value for money  Need smaller sizes for individual"}
{"text":"Fantastic place to go if you are at the airport. Good food and lots of it. Great wine. Would be coming back when passing through. Service was great and price was reasonable for what I had. Again two thumbs up"}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken salad sandwich. Bread was cold and stale, chicken salad was dry and flavorless, side salad was iceberg lettuce, a couple of diced cubes of tomato and cucumber. Waste of money, should've just gone to a fast food place."}
{"text":"Boudevin is an a-ok place as far as airports go. It is a small-plate spot, with a fair bit of antipasti selections. I wasn't too impressed with the wine list, but there are a range of options. For food, hubs and I opted for the meat-heavy antipasti. The cornichon and the stone-ground mustard were fantastic, as was the hard salumi. All of the other meats, though, seemed very bland, out-of-the-package varieties. The ambience was definitely more quiet than your average airport stop, servers were friendly, but maybe a bit too friendly if you know what I mean. While we were there, we saw them serve to a total D-bag who was already waaaay too tipsy and then laugh about it. They also regaled us with a tale from earlier in the day about a near fist-fight over a loud cellphone convo. Come prepared to hang, clearly. Still though, I feel comfortable with my three stars. Boudevin is probably one of the better stops in this airport. I'll admit, wIth the menu, I had high expectations. Have y'all ever been to a Surdyk's? They can be found in the upper Midwest and the the one at the airport is the bomb. Although Surdy's this isn't, it's still a-ok."}
{"text":"I was so happy to find real food at the airport.  The service was friendly, my wine was delicious and reasonably priced- considering the location, and my food was good.  I didn't time the arrival of my food, but the place was fairly full and I still received it promptly.  I chose the open-faced chicken sandwich with roasted peppers and it was far more than I could eat."}
{"text":"Nice quiet restaurant in the middle of Charlotte airport. I'll definitely be back.  I had the turkey Reuben. Very tasty."}
{"text":"I visited here since Bruce K. suggested it was the top restaurant in the airport and Trip Advisor and Yelp also seem to agree.    If you cant find anything on their decent sized menu, make sure to glance at their chef's tasting menu (specials), which are sometimes a better deal and come with a side, like their quinoa apple salad.  I chose a simple farmer's salad since I had a large lunch and added seared salmon, similar to Jenny L.  Although, they have replaced the smoked salmon as an add-on for $5.50, with the seared salmon for $7.50.  I'm sure you can still add smoked salmon if you really wanted.  I prefer the seared, and mine was seared to a medium to give you an idea.  The only ingredient I didn't taste in the dish was the vinaigrette.  This is a great little salad where the goat cheese adds a nice contrast to the leafy lettuce.  I sat at the bar for optimal service in a busy airport and there was no one seated next to me.  Some of their wines are pricy, but they offer various pour sizes to fit most budgets."}
{"text":"This place is a solid 4, whish is great when talking about airport places to eat.  I had the Greek wedge salad with chicken and some Pinot Noir wine.  The salad had a zesty greek dressing and lots of good ingredients-- did I say bacon bits, real bacon? Oh yeah real bacon, check!   Very flavorful.  There were 4 people at the table next to me and they had different larger salads, and all of them made happy plates so I guess theirs was really good too.  Granted, the place is not cheap. If you want cheap, go to one of the fast food type places in the airport--there are many to choose from, but if you want nice, relaxing atmosphere with lots of good wine choices, go here and give it a try."}
{"text":"Great wine selection and generous portions for the price. Small cheese plate was huge and delicious! Will definitely stop back on my next layover."}
{"text":"Slow service. Waitress seams unhappy hear. Chicken BLT was only cut halfway through. Food is pretty bland. Good wine list. Wish I went to the Market restaurant and deli around the corner...even the waitress recommended it for more food options. Stay for the nice ambiance. The charcuterie plate looks nice."}
{"text":"Wow! This place in an airport!? Second time here and if you like good quality food and wine, stop here. The staff is very courteous and attentive. The bar has full power strips for on the go charging. It's upscale casual, prices are to be expected with location. Amazing selection of cheese plates, tapas.  They have appx 30 types of wine to try including flights. The bar has a pretty good selection too."}
{"text":"About the best airport food I've had.  Staff was excellent, hostess seated us at a great table for 2 right by an outlet when she knew I was about out of juice.  My wife and I had a 2012 Justin red blend after studying the wine list for a long time.  $118 ain't cheap but the wine retails for about $70 so the markup was reasonable and we had the time to sit and drink and enjoy.  The cheese platter was a bargain at $13, not bad cheese plus apricot jam, dried fruits and nuts.  Definately something to share.  We split the garden salad with goat cheese which was very nice.  We also had the hummus (we had a 4 hour layover and a company credit card).  Also about perfect."}
{"text":"For airport food- amazing!  Great quiet place to tuck away with your loved one and have a bottle of wine.  We had the small cheese plate and it was plenty for a meal for 2.  Great service too:)"}
{"text":"Staff was polite & knowledgeable about their selections. All wines are served in the appropriately made stemware as designated by type of wine. If you don't have a lot of time but want the experience check out their small plates, for a sweet tooth I recommend the small desserts & a sweet white. The opportunity to try small portions and pair with whine accordingly is great, especially with the 3 oz. pour option. For every layover or stop in Charlotte from now on, you'll find me here."}
{"text":"It is pretty hard to find a great airport restaurant, but if you are traveling through Charlotte, I would say this is definitely one your better options available"}
{"text":"This is the best airport meal I have ever had.  If you are looking for something other than fast food this is a great place to check out.  I had the chef's tasting menu.  The waitress said it was a limited time offering due to restaurant week.  I was a little surprised that an airport restaurant was participating in restaurant week.  It seemed strange, but I did not ask for the details.  My tasting menu consisted of some a mini wedge salad, some whipped hummus with pita, a grilled chicken breast and some roasted potatoes.  Everything tasted fresh, and despite my chicken breast being room temperature I enjoyed everything.    Airport foods is usually a disaster and at best the quality of your local fast food.  At worst it can make travelling miserable.  Beaudevin is a refreshing change from this.  It was a tasty, fresh healthy meal.  I will definitely go back the next time I fly through Charlotte."}
{"text":"While scoping out all the cafeteria- line style food vendors and passing on all of their artery-clogging options, I stumbled across Beaudevin.  So glad I did.  But giving up wine for Lent and sitting in this place is like forcing a crack addict to sit in a crack house... Anyway, got the Spinach salad with grilled chicken.  Simply delicious.  Nice layers of egg, bacon, red onion, Pt. Reyes blue cheese, and tossed with olive oil.  Yum.  This place is truly an oasis on the airport food scene.  But wait there's more... They have individual I Pads at the bar that you can freely use.  And there are electrical outlets under the bar to keep your devices going strong.  Bravo."}
{"text":"For an airport restaurant I would say you would be hard-pressed to find better. The wine by the glass was surprisingly good (Pinot Noir). And the tapas style small plates kept wowing one after another. From the prosciutto & melon to the cheese plate to the caprese skewers, to the bread plate and olives. The only average ones were the shrimp cocktail and the humus. Not bad mind you, just not up to par with their small plate siblings.  And as for the salad mains, I did the grilled artichoke. A solid good. The creamy whipped goat made for a nice complement to the peppery arugula.  Oh, and our server was awesome. Quick, friendly and without writing anything down she didn't forget a single order from the 6 people in our party."}
{"text":"If I could give less stars I would.   Beaudevin's secret to success:  Step 1: Service issues Step 2: Sanitation issues Step 3: Food issues   The single star is for simply having wine and just generally existing."}
{"text":"Should be a 3.5 Star rating.  In my second life I am going to open an airport restaurant.  As a frequent traveler I am always disappointed with Airport food offerings (hometown Austin airport is among the worst).  However, there is a new breed of Airport restaurants slowly becoming available.  If Beaudevin was located outside the airport I would probably give it a three star rating, but while in the airport it is an escape from the surrounding madness.  Offering wine by the glass (at a great value), small plates, coffee, in a quiet, clean, and friendly environment; Beaudevin is far and away the best option while in the Charlotte airport.   After surviving TSA, another delayed flight, or just the typical maniacs, do yourself a favor and grab a seat at Beaudevin."}
{"text":"I landed in Charlotte around 11am, and needed to grab a quick lunch before heading out to a meeting.  I only had about 30 minutes but didn't want to eat junk.  I stumbled upon this place and sat at the bar and quickly ordered.  Baby spinach salad with no bacon, add chicken.  I was not disappointed.  The food was fresh and hit the spot.  I was able to get in and out in 30 minutes.  The place was pretty empty but the decor was pretty."}
{"text":"The roasted red pepper hummus is described as coming with toasted \"nan\" bread and \"olive\". The dish came out with a supermarket version of a baguette, not toasted. I pointed this out to the waiter and he brought out some supermarket pita bread.....that was not toasted. As for \"olive\", there were no olives, but the hummus was topped with tapenade. This is like saying a plate includes apple, but the feature is topped with applesauce.  On top of the inaccuracies, I was charged for a larger version of wine than I ordered.  This is probably the healthiest restaurant at CLT, which brought me here in the first place. However, I probably would've had a better dining experience at the Burger King next door. Let alone, not have the staff attempt to rip me off.  BTW; They charge $3.29 for soda water."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in any airport I travel through and I travel a lot. Always an excellent experience, both food and service. Fresh, delicious choices in a lounge type atmosphere. This is one airport I always hope to have extra time in so I may eat here."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! A must-try for any wine and tapas lover passing through Charlotte!"}
{"text":"The food was great and it was a nice respite from the crowds and craziness of traveling.  READ THE MENU CAREFULLY. I ordered a glass of wine at $13. Spendy, but acceptable if you consider I'm paying airport captive audience upcharge so whatever.   Come to find when I get the bill that glass of wine actually cost $26. Oh really? What I hadn't noticed was that the $13 option was for a 3oz glass of wine.   On what F#$*#&$ planet is a glass of wine 3 ounces? You people should be ashamed for tricking tired customers like that. Shame on you! And don't even try to tell me that it wasn't deliberate because of course it is. If you want to pretend that this is something cute and special you do, then MAKE IT CLEAR UPFRONT TO EVERY CUSTOMER EVERY TIME.   What would have otherwise been a splendid dinner by myself left me very upset and feeling cheated and taken advantage of. Lucky for you that you rely on a steady stream of travelers so you don't have be decent people to get repeat business to stay open.  I also waited for about 5 minutes to be seated and was not acknowledged once. It was not busy at all, just understaffed. When no hostess came, I sat at the bar. I saw no fewer than five customers come in, look at the sandwich case, wait for service, and leave having never been acknowledged.   The food itself was great. The waitstaff that were there were pretty pleasant, if few in number."}
{"text":"Went here because of most of good reviews online. This place is a big disappointment. We ordered the Steak Cabernet & Mushroom small plate and Grinder sandwich. The small plate dish was watery, very soupy, the steak tip is actually very thin sliced to steak, chewy, not seared & caramelized,  more like boiled. The Grinder sandwich was terrible, thick cold bread with few slices of very thin meat (one piece of prosciutto and few slices of ham) with tomato slices and pickled green beans. I would have just bought sandwich like this at any of the express counter in the airport. They would probably taste better than the one we had here. And the bar tender kept throwing glass bottle into bucket full of other bottles making loud noise. Will never come here again."}
{"text":"Well, was unable to purchase a day pass at admirals club due to hurricane Irma and there were no American Express lounges at the Charlotte airport. So I pulled up yelp and the miracle appeared the Beaudevin. 4 stars at an airport!! Never seen that before so of course I embarked upon finding it! Thankfully it was located near my concourse or I would have said uh no. So glad I went! Gorgeous decor, relaxing and elegant. Had a cocktail and the grilled salmon - both were delicious! The salmon came with an amazing beer salad and asparagus. Excellent, professional staff. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is some of the best airport restaurants available in the US. Plus nice wine selection. I love that you can order 3oz to 9 oz pours.   The server provided excellent recommendations. I love it when you ask for recommendations and they thoughtfully provide this. That alone gives them 5 stars.   I had the farmers salad with steak. Salad was super fresh. Steak was a little overdone and dry but good flavor.  I chose the 3 oz serving of 3 different white wines. I enjoyed them all.  They also have wine flights.   Next trip to CLT will include a stop here."}
{"text":"Best food in Charlotte airport. Real French press coffee, very nice breakfast, calm atmosphere, good service. And they let you hang out without rushing you. It's almost worth flying thru CLT for."}
{"text":"CLT airport is in the process of making improvements, and Terminal B in particular seems gutted - torn up flooring, loose wires hanging from the ceiling, and not nearly enough seating at the gates. I wasn't particularly hungry, but stepped into Beaudevin to escape the crush, and I'm so glad I did. The restaurant itself is peaceful, airy, and well decorated. I absolutely love the wine glass chandeliers that they have over the bar top. I took a seat at the bar and was greeted immediately; service was super friendly and efficient, and very knowledgeable about their extensive wine list. They also have power outlets on the underside of the bar which came in handy. The menu is small - salads, sandwiches, small plates - but held a nice variety of items. I had the smoked salmon sandwich and really enjoyed it. It came with HUGE pieces of smoked salmon. I'm talking like a centimeter thick, not like the nearly transparent slivers that you might get at other restaurants. The raisin bread wouldn't have been my first choice, but ended up working well with the herbed cream cheese, micro greens, fresh tomato and red onion. The wedge salad topped with diced tomato and cucumber was fresh, but unfortunately not dressed except for a small drizzle of olive. Overall I spent $27 for a sandwich and a delicious glass of Syrah, pretty typical for airport prices and well worth some peace and quiet in this otherwise crowded airport."}
{"text":"For airport food, it's pretty good. Plenty of space. Design is really nice, especially for an airport. It's expensive, but it's an airport. I had the farmers salad with chicken. It was good (the goat cheese was awesome) and a smoked bourbon Manhattan, which was decent. Would this be something I would seek out if I were going out to dinner with the wife? Probably not. But for an airport? Definitely"}
{"text":"Excellent wine by the glass. Cheese and meat platters delicious !"}
{"text":"If you happen to be waiting for a flight connection in Charlotte NC during the AM hours, do not hesitate to visit this restaurant. Breakfast is freshly made and coffee is really good. I ordered the Morning Tartine for $11.00. Although, my waitress was good an attentive, the overall treatment, from greeting to the end was average; this is so typical in airports."}
{"text":"If you are at CLT and want food that isn't \"fast food\", I guess this would be it.  In the strip of restaurants at the airport, Beaudevin is definitely more of a sit-down type and slightly upscale.  Went for breakfast....the breakfast menu is pretty small.  I had the bagel with salmon lox, and it was pretty good.  This place is going to cost you a bit more than most of the other food around, but it gives you a way to escape from the busy areas of the airport."}
{"text":"Two stars on account of incredible wine selection for an airport bar. Zero stars for service and accommodation. Long story short: we were told by server that there was one 6oz. glass of 2002 Heitz (32.50) in house, so we ordered that plus a lesser choice glass (26). When wines arrived we were advised that in fact there was a FULL BOTTLE of Heitz. Obviously we asked to substitute the lesser glass for a glass of the Heitz. Manager advised that it was not possible because they would lose money on the swap. Also, vintages not listed on the menu. For those prices one shouldn't have to ask."}
{"text":"Best airport dining experience so far! The Scottish salmon sandwich was absolutely delicious - huge portion, well seasoned, awesome artisan bread. The wine was good as well, and I liked the option of half glass."}
{"text":"Mediocre food, service, and wine list. Airport prices, not much more to say here. Food is similar to what you might find at one of the free standing deli kiosks in the airport only with a more upscale atmosphere. My waitress was ok but I was one of 4 people in the whole place and she was polite but still a bit slow. Wine is expensive and priced by the 1/2 glass, full glass, and big glass...which when you see any place you should know you are paying a fat markup for."}
{"text":"Nice and mostly quiet. Food is great and consistent. My advice, check your bill and make sure you are paying for what you ordered. My neighbor at the bar and I got over charged for doubles we did not order. Tried to get it corrected but the bartender was not available. Had a flight to catch so I had to pay it. Unfortunate.  Bad business. Probably will go somewhere else going forward.."}
{"text":"Love, LOVE, Love this place.  I have missed my Charlotte layovers lately.  I have been flying through Philly.  Most airports now have a wine bar somewhere.  But none are like this.  Large, great atmosphere, great food selections and completely reasonable in price.  Service is great and Sarah is amazing as a server!"}
{"text":"I agree with many of the other reviewers  - this place is calm amidst the storm. After missing my connection and getting stuck with a 2+ hour wait, Beaudevin was just what I needed; outlets to work, nice wine, and fresh food. The produce was not top notch - but for airport? 5 stars."}
{"text":"Good, but not great, food.  Nice wine.  Total time from sitdown to depart just slightly over one hour.  Important to travelers is that this is not the fastest place in the airport.  I would recommend allocating just over one hour for lunch and that is simply sitting, ordering a drink, ordering lunch, eating, paying.  No after lunch chatting.    Decided to try Beaudevin as an alternative to the traditional airport stuff.  It is pleasant looking and you can either sit outside where the action is going on or go inside for a respite from the activity.  I sat outside but if I return I will sit inside. Prices range from $15-23 for a good lunch plus drinks.   The wine I ordered was very nice but at $19 for a 9oz pour one would expect as much.  I ordered the BLT with a salad.  The salad was the highlight of the meal.  The BLT was good, not great, but good.  The server was extremely pleasant.  The only downside was the time it took for the overall experience.  My opinion is that it is a kitchen issue rather than a waitstaff issue.  However, if you have a bit over an hour to spend on a good meal and glass of wine at CLT this might be your place."}
{"text":"Service is slow, but good restaurant in the airport. I had their tomato soup which was divine. The Malbec wine was not the best, but it will do. I recommend the salmon capers sandwich, it was pretty good. I would return if in had another long layover in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Not only the best meal I have ever had in an airport but one of the best meals I have had anywhere. Cheese plate, charcuterie plate, chicken pesto flat bread, seared steak and mushrooms, Scottish smoked salmon...amazing white peach Bellini. Fantastic wine list. Too bad they don't have more locations. Unfortunately the service didn't match their amazing quality of food and decor. We wanted to order dessert and another drink but didn't have time when our server finally came back to the table. We own a restaurant and deal with staffing all the time. Made the comment to each other while dining that it was yet another great restaurant tainted by less than average service. I would say the place is pricey but at $111 for 5 small plates and 2 beverages, I felt I got great value for money and have paid way more for lesser quality of food at other restaurants. While the service didn't match the food and decor, it won't stop us from returning to this restaurant. We are already planning to return next month."}
{"text":"Nice surprise in the airport!!!!  LOVED the goat cheese arugula salad."}
{"text":"Great airport eats! Healthy and relatively quick... Though a bit on the pricey side. I ate here twice during my stay in Charlotte. The Prosciutto scramble for breakfast and the farmers salad with grilled chicken were fantastic. I loved the goat cheese and beets in the salad...I'd eat here again, for sure!"}
{"text":"Food was great. Love the 3 oz wine portion as an option.  Also offer 6 and 9 oz pours.  Service not on par with quality of food and atmosphere.  Sarah was good but needs to be more engaging with customers."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. While the wine selection is good, food is lackluster. I've had the salmon sandwich in raisin bread, which was dry, with a side salad. I had to ask for extra dressing as it was dry, too.   The next time I had the Turkey Reuben and my colleague had a sandwich, too. Disappointed to see both pressed behind the bar and not coming fresh from the kitchen. My turkey was a bit mushy, as well. Neither of us could taste dressing on our salads and this time service took awhile."}
{"text":"Horrible!  Had to stop a Mgr after waiting almost 20 minutes. Food was subpar and had to wait another 10 minutes for a refill. They surely ran my debit card quick......not suggested at all. Pass on this even if you love wine."}
{"text":"I've gotten the open-faced tartine smoked salmon sandwich a handful of times now that I've had to make multiple layovers here. I've tried my luck with the other fast food court choices - This restaurant is, by far, the best quality and most comfortable environment.   The bread is a rich, dense pecan raisin. I would have actually liked it cut a little more thinly because I don't need that much. The salmon is plentiful and I love the bright lemon juice, salty capers, creamy feta, bite of red onion, juicy tomato chunks and fresh greens on top. This was actually quite a filling sandwich.  My only major gripe is that it has sometimes taken me a while to get seated, but the food usually comes fairly quickly."}
{"text":"Good wine, bad food. Breakfast looked good, but is over at 11a.. even if you order at 11:03a. Slow service on a Friday. I ordered a charcuterie board and it was horrific quality. Go to another fresh food place and just go here for a drink."}
{"text":"This was a joke. I had one hour to wait between flights and I waited 45 minutes for a glass of wine tonight. it is ridiculous and stupid"}
{"text":"Completely underwhelmed by their food offerings.  The waitress was very kind and executed her duties with grace.  That said,  the grinder sandwich was a major step down from Subway.  I paid $30 for a sandwich and a beer and ended up having to go somewhere else to satisfy my hunger.  Looks like they have a nice selection of wine but the food offerings were mediocre at best."}
{"text":"It is a very rare treat to find a restaurant in an airport you would frequent even if you weren't flying...   Beaudevin is one such place.  We'd begun our day at 4am - with a 90 drive to an airport - then our flight with connection in Charlotte.  We had a four hour layover.... needed breakfast and a way to begin the day again...  This was the spot!   Nothing about it 'felt' like an airport restaurant -  or a chain formula restaurant for that matter..... I just want to say thank you to the restaurant staff for their smiling, kind, personal attention, and very efficient service.  You all made us feel relaxed, and maybe a bit pampered - the food and coffee were WONDERFUL - and we felt we could take all the time we liked (granted, the restaurant was not horribly busy at that hour).   We headed to our next gate feeling far better than when we arrived.  The rest of the day went smoothly (or at least we coped very well)  - and I honestly,  truly feel it was in part due to our great experience at Beaudevin.  Its really amazing how one experience can sometimes make, recover, or sour a whole day - even when your trying your best.  Again, thank you to everyone at Beaudevin for making our day !!"}
{"text":"Good wine selection, great cheese plate, charcuterie plate wasn't bad. Its as good as you will find in most any airport."}
{"text":"Great service. Knowledgeable staff. Good place to spend time waiting for a flight. Limited food menu, but extended wine menu. Pleasant atmosphere for conversation."}
{"text":"I connect through CLT three or four times per year. Time between flights is generally very short, so it's my custom to stop at Brookwood Farms in the airport atrium to grab a pulled pork/coleslaw sandwich with a side of turnip greens. It's pretty good \"Q\" and a great stop before returning home to Baltimore (I grew up in Alabama, so I know good Southern food).  A trip last week was going to result in a 2.5 hour layover in CLT. Since it was going to be mid-day, I checked online to see if I could find some sort of sit-down alternative. Found reviews of Beaudevin and thought I'd give it a try.  This would never work if you didn't have a reasonable amount of time to kill. Airports by their very nature are hectic places and you'd feel like you needed to rush. With 2.5 hours, I knew I had time to sit and relax. You couldn't choose a better place for it. The restaurant is quietly tucked away at the back of the Atrium. It's just a couple of doors from Brookwood Farms BBQ, but feels a world away. You're in a quiet and calming environment watching the harried travelers from a comfortable distance.   Based on environment alone, I'd definitely stop again if I'm in CLT for a longer period of time. There's a pretty decent limited wine selection and several interesting 3oz flights if you want to try that.   I first ordered a 9oz pour of a Malbec. Kudos to the waiter for pointing out that there were two Malbecs available. The one I intended to order was 1/3 the price of the other.   I was in the mood to just relax from a busy week away, so ordered the charcuterie to start. The meats were good and serving plates were pretty, but the plate itself looked like someone just tossed some assorted meats in a pile. I saw several nice-looking ones go past, so must've just had bad luck in who prepared mine.  I live in Maryland, so had to order the crab cocktail. It was a nice-sized portion of lumb crabmeat, lightly dressed and served with crispy flat bread.  Food was good, but not exceptional. I thought it was very pricey for what I was served, but worth it to just remove myself from the travel experience for an hour. Service was very good and the atmosphere was very nice and very calming. Would definitely go again if I have a longer layover in CLT."}
{"text":"Yelp reviews did not let me down. The food was good for an airport restaurant. Service was great too.   I was here for breakfast. My scramble was as Ordered.  The mini croissant was fresh, and the grapes were yummy.  I also order hot tea. The main reason I decided to eat here was because I saw a customer drinking herbal tea. Any restaurant that has more than just Lipton tea deserves a second look, in my book. The jasmine green tea I ordered did not disappoint. It's always the little things ;)."}
{"text":"Wow, healthy, delicious, and beautifully plated. Quality was superb. I ordered an open face Smoked Salmon Sandwich and it was delicious!  Service was excellent.  Ambience is classy and cozy. Coffee was flavorful and frothy (good indication of being fresh). A+++"}
{"text":"Thank god. After the Yadkin Valley wine bar at CLT got swept away by \"all the brands you love!\" (no), this airport became far less interesting. But Beaudevin brings some of that goodness back. The focus is not local, but then again, that's probably a good business decision since you need to play into a much wider market than wine geeks. The food is decent, the service is great, and the wine options were interesting."}
{"text":"Now, after my 10th stop here, I can say that this place is consistent...Wine done right, menu pairs well, service is good but not inviting. This is still one of my favorite airport stops."}
{"text":"They disperse Tap water and never asked if we wanted a glass why dont they have reverse osmosis....?   Very expensive and uninformative when we asked how much cheese was on a plate she made it sound like we needed two orders so we did and oh my god $26 for Way too much cheese"}
{"text":"Whenever I travel through Charlotte on a Monday morning I stop here for breakfast.  I like the ambiance and the breakfast food.  It has never been crowded (That is not good for them).  The scrambles are great and if you are looking for a healthier meal, try the Greek yogurt, granola and fruit dish.  The only place I can get this in Charlotte.  There is not a huge selection, but they have what I like to eat.   When I travel back thru on Friday evening I always stop for a glass of wine and the cheese plate.   I compare this place to One Flew South in the Atlanta airport, except they just have a much smaller menu."}
{"text":"Could be a 4-star stop, but since it's in the main terminal of CLT, this spot gets FIVE stars. You could walk 50 feet and eat at Chili's, or you can get real food at Beaudevin. True, there are no prices on the posted menu board, but the waiter handed us a menu when we asked. Amazingly, prices are reasonable: our family of four ate for under $50 (no wine or drinks). We arrived hungry, and everyone had plenty, so portions were fine. My open-face chicken sandwich was delicious, as was the Mediterranean Salad. Lots of veggie options. Bruschetta was delicious and served as a meal for one in our party, as did the charcuterie platter.  If you walk in the back entrance by the bathrooms, you'll see a sample of prepared plates, and a deli counter that shows the meats and cheeses they use... all decent eats.  Food came out quickly, which is a feat. Note that we were one of four tables when we landed, so YMMV. We were in/out in 45 minutes. There are no \"chicken nugget\" kiddie items on the menu... YAY! But, plenty of attainable and tasty options for everyone.  Next time I'm flying USAir thru Charlotte, this place will get another visit. Hopefully, other Yelpers will keep this place afloat. Only spots that rival this are in Terminal 2 @ SFO... with San Fran prices. A REAL WINNER here.  My only wish: that there were a couple high-end cultish or hard-to-find wines by the glass. Since Beaudevin has the fancy nitrogen wine dispensers, you can already get a lot of neat wines by the glass, like Caymus Cab. But there was nothing on the list I just had to try right then. Minor quibble."}
{"text":"Inside is very nice and impressive, just not impressed with the food. My Bloody Mary was nice and spicy but a little too briny I prefer a more of a smokey flavor, $14 btw. The steak sandwich was small for the price (I know there are airport prices but still) and not very flavorful. The bread was nice and chewy, steak was overlooked and under seasoned, and the aoli was flavorless.  The charcuterie salad was ok, I think the Dijon dressing competed a little too much with the other flavored. A balsamic vinaigrette would've probably been better. The turkey sandwich was comparable to the steak sandwich, not much flavor. I probably wouldn't eat here again."}
{"text":"I travel through Charlotte airport around once a month. Beaudevin is a nice place to grab a bite during a layover and is somewhat hidden in the rear of atrium area. The food beats many of the other airport restaurants and, during my visit, there were plenty of open tables during, what I consider, one of the busier times of day. I had the pulled pork tacos lunch which were surprisingly good for a place at which that doesn't seem to be their specialty. There is also an extensive wine menu and plenty of other food options sure to satisfy many tastes."}
{"text":"What a treat. A quiet little escape from the airport. Decent selection of Red wines and I found a favorite in the list: Caymus. Many whites though I can't speak to the whites. Really good fresh focused menu with a delicatessen twist. The small cheese plate was good and plentiful.   The prices are really outrageous, but that is expected for the quality within an airport location."}
{"text":"Try their breakfast flatbread, with a fresh cup of strong Illy coffee. The perfect meal."}
{"text":"I would fly back through CLT even though it is out of the way to eat at Beaudevin.  Best food in the airport for a great price.  If you like wine fantastic as well.  Even though I chose tea this time because of a bumpy flight in."}
{"text":"An airport restaurant that is worth reviewing. Awesome, quiet spot in the Charlotte airport. Its tucked away behind all the hustle and bustle in the main atrium. Best open faced salmon sandwich i've ever had. Ceviche is pretty decent too. The bar is usually pretty social (i.e. people willing to converse instead of dazing mindlessly into their phones)."}
{"text":"Wow! Good little egg Florentine breakfast with a mini croissant! Surprisingly so! The egg was fluffy and quite delicious... the service with a smile, if a bit slow, but I was in no hurry making time for my next flight. The coffee was good too  I reccommend ! If only they had more breakfast choices (they'd get 5 stars!) ... then again, it's not busy at this time so I guess low demand... but good stuff! Check it out! (Wanted to add that at $15 for breakfast, an outlet to charge my phone, and table service, it was a great spot to wait for my connection!)"}
{"text":"Wine selection was decent but food selection could be more broad. Wedge salad was very good. Cheese plate above average.  Service was gracious but slow. Overall, very good for airport food but watch your connections."}
{"text":"Came in here during a connection thinking I was going to treat myself to a nice meal. Ordered $12 glass of wine and it came in a dirty glass. Ordered a salad that was missing half of toppings the menu had advertised. The worst was the waiter who never bothered to make eye contact with me, ask me how my meal was, or check in at any point during my meal. He barely gave me the time of day. Given that I fly through Charlotte regularly, makes me to sad to know that the top rated yelp place is the airport is disappointing AND grossly overpriced. Happy to pay for a nice meal if that's what I'm given. Getting the sense that this place is riding on good yelp reviews and its status as the only \"nice\" restaurant in the airport. Save the money and go somewhere else- Really."}
{"text":"The Vegetable Sampler had an unusual collection of flavors. Bartender was knowledgable and patient with the wines. I ended up with a tasty local white. Computers available on the bar. Only problem was, despite efficient service, we relaxed so much, we almost missed our connection"}
{"text":"A great place to relax between connections: my favorite is the Scottish Salmon... simple, tasteful and just the right portion before catching a"}
{"text":"This is my favorite part of this airport. I love when I have to fly through Charlotte so I can stop in there. Breakfast, lunch, dinner, drink, snack - It's all good!"}
{"text":"Every time I am in the Charlotte airport, I stop at this place to get the Farmer's salad. It's so good. Who would think a wine bar in an airport has good food? Seriously... get the farmer's salad. It has goat cheese, pumpkin seeds, beet strings and a few other things with a really tasty vinaigrette. The service at the bar is very good (I just haven't sat at the tables, so I can't speak to that but I guess they are great too) and a good wine selection. If you have at least an hour to kill at the Charlotte airport, I highly recommend going here."}
{"text":"One of the best airport dining experiences I have hasd.  The only bad thing is that it is too easy to forget that you are in an airport, and thus loose track of time.  The restaurant is set back from the hub bub of the main airport traffic, and the seating is comfy, and the décor is beautiful.  Plus, under the bar are electric outlets for you to power up your electronic devices while you wait.  The staff were friendly, and the server waiting on us at the bar was very knowledgeable.  The grilled vegetable open faced sandwich was incredible, and the bread was tasty.  The truffles were OK, nothing like Switzerland, but pretty good.  The local port was tasty.  They had a great wine selection, and even had some nice tasting flights of 3 glasses to choose from.  A highlight of the Charlotte Airport."}
{"text":"Great little find in a busy, loud airport. You can tuck away for a little peace and quite. Grab a small bite and some quality wine. Rare in an airport."}
{"text":"I travel a lot for my job - I am in and out of airports like a puberty-stricken 8th grader is in and out of a new pair of Nike's.  And, having to spend as much time as I do traveling, it's nice to be able to say - I had a good meal...in an airport.  JFK is a good option - the Jet Blue terminal there has some great food options.  Just to put it in perspective for you - Buffalo's Airport - my home terminal, sucks as far as food options go.  I've never been to Maddie's outside of Gate 16 and I sure as hell won't be going there anytime soon.  Which sandwich would you like to get at Which Which? Which one?  You lost me - who's on first?  Sometimes his wife comes and picks it up.    But Beaudevin was a fresh of breath air (wait for it...) for airport cuisine.  Fellow Yelpers may recall a question I posted in asking where to find a good  charcutuerie in Buffalo.  No one really had what I was looking for - which, thanks to NYC's Eataly, will never be topped.  But, I found a close second at Beaudevin in the Charlotte Airport.    Clean, serene, prompt and tasty.  Well done."}
{"text":"Like many reviewers, only had the pleasure of eating here once on a layover. Next CLT layover, I'll return.   Definitely non-airport feel once inside which was very welcome. The staff was extremely upbeat and although service wasn't exactly quick.. I was in and out in 45 minutes for lunch.   I had the farmer's salad with grilled chicken. Had I only ordered this (sans wine), the total would have been similar to some other restaurant offering much less healthy and fresh items. The salad was quite large and had really unique and delicious flavors (those shaved beets are mmmmmm and the cheese is oh so creamy). It is pretty loaded with dressing, though, so for my preference, I wished I had ordered it on the side."}
{"text":"This space is lovely. The food is terrible.  The shrimp ceviche bragged of avocado and jumbo shrimp. The shrimp might have started out jumbo, but they were cooked down to be the size of popcorn shrimp. They were tough and lacked any flavor. What once might have been a sliver of avocado was nothing more than greenish slime in the bottom of the bowl. This dish was mostly just acid sludge.  I also ordered the spinach salad. The first thing delivered was an arugula salad. I should have kept that. When the spinach salad came, it was overdressed (again, pure acid) so that the croutons were just soggy flatbread.   I had a flight of wine. The Riesling was surprisingly good. Not too sweet. The Sav Blanc was vaguely reminiscent of warm swamp water.  Wishing I'd packed a kind bar in my bag. I won't come back to this place. I suggest you not either."}
{"text":"What a great place to hang out when US Airways hangs you out to dry for a few extra hours.  We had the Mediterranean MIsto Salad and a Scottish Smoked Salmon and both were delicious.  But more importantly, the wine selection here is fabulous, including such rock star names as Grgich and Stag's Leap. Lovely.  Location - 5 STARS Ambiance - 4 1/2 STARS Food & Wine - 5 STARS Service - 5 STARS Noise Level - high"}
{"text":"Good wine selection but poor quality food and lackluster service. This is my third time here and the second time they did not have the ingredients necessary to prepare the meal I ordered from their menu. That didn't stop them though. They substituted without asking and served me hoping I wouldn't notice."}
{"text":"Flight delay allowed us to have a wonderful breakfast here at beaudevin. Sarah is a 5 star waitress.  Great lox and bagels, eggs florentine, and Greek yogurt surved with exceptional coffee."}
{"text":"I love wine and I stopped here to get a good glass of wine, even though I knew it would be pricey.  So I asked the waiter's recommendation and he recommended the red Zinfandel.  I was excited to chill with a tasty glass of wine, but the $14 .00 six ounce glass of wine was bad!  I just spent a weekend in California and spent $4 for a bottle of better wine.  I nicely mentioned that the wine was not good and the waiter said I would have to pay more for a better wine!  Wow, really!  All you glasses of wine should be drinkable!  I am content with two buck chuck and I do not see myself as a wine snob, but this was horrible wine from a WINE bar!  Expected standard!  Even the wine on the plane is better!"}
{"text":"Eh considering I spent $10 per salad, it was a ripoff that they forgot the ham :( this is not a good place to go to if you don't have much time until your flight"}
{"text":"Who would have thought that I could get such a good meal at the airport.  We had a chicken sandwich and a Mediterranean salad.  The chicken was moist and flavorful on great bread.  The salad was fresh and very enjoyable.  For some reason the whole weekend we never ordered dessert.  We had berries with Greek yogurt in a chocolate bowl.  Absolutely delicious.  The Stella great too"}
{"text":"What a refreshing interior, I did not have time to try the food but enjoyed a glass of excellent wine served by professional staff. Will look forward to next layover, hope they get some more exotic wine pours in the future."}
{"text":"Friendly hostess, nice atmosphere, not rushed. My waiter took a long time finding me and forgot my salad. Ordered the turkey reuben, one of the items marked as special or recommended on the menu. The sandwich was oily and tough. I ate just half. The \"dirty chips\" were just slightly stale potato chips, didn't eat them. Waiter never asked about the food or I would have been honest. At the end I reminded him of the salad, the farmers greens. It was good though not generous. Disappointing meal and not cheap."}
{"text":"Good place for something small and healthy to eat. Good wine selection for an airport place.   Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Beaudevin is a nice spot in the Charlotte airport to grab a glass of wine and relax. They offer wine by the taste (3 oz), by the glass (6oz), and large glass (9 oz) as well as wine flights. Prices aren't cheap, but can you really put a price on peace and quiet at the airport?  My husband and I each ordered a glass of wine and split the large charcuterie plate. The charcuterie was good and the wine was excellent. The restaurant also has sandwiches and dinner entrees if you are seeking something heartier than a snack.  Will definitely stop here again if I have a layover in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Exactly what I needed - a great oasis in CLT.  After the frustration of being stuck in CLT overnight, I went to the airport Sunday morning (yes in the same clothes as the day before) and went to have breakfast.  I saw a place that I never noticed before, looked at the menu, and yes, they had me at prosciutto scramble.   Well you know what I ordered...and it was fabulous  (The service was great as well)!  The very flavorful scramble was served on supremely buttery and flaky mini croissants; This was a great start to the day.     The location looks awesome for lunch or dinner, the ambiance is clean and modern, the food choices look interesting and the wines / drinks look like they would be great as well.  (It made me excited enough to even drink wine :D).    As a somewhat frequent flyer through the Charlotte Airport, I will be back at \"the beauty of wine\" again."}
{"text":"Charlotte Airport has a great deal of choice for food and drinks and this is one of the best.  You can eat healthy here and enjoy a nice glass of wine or cocktail before your flights"}
{"text":"This could easily be a 4 star. Especially considering it's location. Let me dig in on why it's not a 4 star in my book.   There was a grumpy hostess who...well...not a big deal just an awkward way to start the meal experience. They've got a great atmosphere and a great feel in every way...besides her lacking greeting skills. Maybe she is having a bad day, but as the face you don't get to bring \"bad day\" to work. She did her job just fine but I saw her interaction and body language aimed at a couple that seemed to want a seat that she wasn't willing to give them. That cost the 1/8 of a star.  The other 1/8 of a star is gone because they didn't have a great selection of gluten free dishes from what I could tell. Although I didn't study the menu, the gluten free didn't jump out holy wow the song they have on now makes me angry.   It's in an airport. I can't rank an airport restaurant on the same level as the Wayfare. I just can't. The luggage, the noise of the airport, the fact that I'm angry because I missed a flight...that's a 1/4 of a star BUT the fact that the atmosphere is peaceful earns most of the 1/4 of a star back.   1/4 of a star down because I ordered poorly. I got spinach artichoke dip and I should have gotten the cheese board. The dip is fine. Not great. Not terrible. But fine.   1/4 of a star gone because of the price to execution ratio. If you're going to charge this much for these items (yes, even in an airport where tacking on 50% up charge to a bottle of water is customary)  Stems stems stems. Please, if you're going to get in pretty micro greens, ex ventilate the microness of them. Leaving them on the long thicker stems makes them unpleasant texturally and aesthetically distracting from the beautiful salmon. I get I paid a bunch but either back up on the caper or hit up more salmon. There has to be more salmon than caper.   DISCLAIMER: I'm a chef and in digging in real technically. Would I eat here again? Yes, anytime I fly through here I aim to. Can I see this being a 4 star place, yes. I just haven't eaten here enough to slap a 4th star on it yet.   Also, the plates are fun. The actual plates. Wooden. Clear glass. Just fun. Ok ok. I blasted on the music and now Dean Martin is on. I take it back.   Onto what other people have ordered: Knowledgable staff when it comes to wine. The salads are of epic portion size. They look pleasant too.   *puts headphones back on  After Deano ended they really hopped into some seriously un-ok canned garbage music.   Ok. I'm not getting dessert but, it looks flat out sexy. I don't even know what the hell it was, but the waitress proposed it to a guest sitting two seats from me...by proposed it I mean she got almost in one knee and showed off how amazing it was.   Now I want to take a picture of what this lady next to me just ordered. Damn it. This place is creeping into the 4 star range and that...I just...I can't. I'll have to eat more to be sure.   If you're in this airport for more than half an hour spend 45 minutes and some bucks here.   Cheers.   Find out why I'm not in my kitchen on a Friday afternoon at  NolaChef504.com"}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times in the past couple years. I'd say it is the best airport food I've had anywhere. Granted that's not a very high standard but it could certainly hold its own in any market for great French/Belgian style food and very good wine too. It's a key reason to look forward to connecting through Charlotte."}
{"text":"Stop by Beaudevin for a classy refresher while traveling, and groove to the grand piano (more likely than not) being played nearby. I love to treat myself to Beaudevin when traveling through the Charlotte airport. The upscale, modern venue and relaxing music completes your escape from an otherwise uneventful day of traveling.   Beaudevin has a nice wine and food selection, and is considerate of the traveler's time. Short of this, I had a melon and prosciutto appetizer for which I have only compliments. For being in an airport, the fruit was surprisingly good and ripe."}
{"text":"Went with some coworkers during a layover. Since it was my recommendation I'll probably be hearing about it for a while.   My farmers salad with smoked salmon was overdressed but that's fine with me. I would order it again.  One coworker, the most churlish bastard one could ever imagine and who hates lettuce, ordered a BLT minus lettuce with a side of chips. He got the lettuce in the sandwich plus a side salad instead of chips. The look he shot me when the plate hit the table was venomous.   The second coworker seemed to enjoy his smoked salmon sandwich but was puzzled at the choice of raisin bread. He's a kid though and if that is the worst thing to happen to him this week he's living a charmed life.   I get that the staff aren't exactly high on life (and show it), but closer attention to the patrons desires would go a long way to improving customer satisfaction."}
{"text":"This is a great place if you want to feel like you are not actually dining in an airport. Good food, service, bar and atmosphere. I had lunch here and enjoyed the Farmer's Salad with smoked salmon. The salad; mixed field greens, shaved beets, roasted pumpkin seeds, goat cheese with sherry vinaigrette. I would definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Like others. I'm giving the airport disclaimer, so these are 4 airport points, not rest of the world points.   I'll start with the positives.   Great atmosphere. Very modern but comfortable. Tons of space at the tables to store your bag, spread out comfortably, and relax. You will not feel cramped here unlike most other restaurants in airports. This is a five star feature of the restaurant.  Service was awesome. Pleasant, friendly and fast.  Wine selection is decent, pricey for a 9 oz pour, but ya know, the airport thing. Wine is served in stemware, so that's cool. I got a nine ounce French Rose for $15.  Food. Based on my single visit and only ordering one small plate, I get the impression that a lot of their food is prepared off site. I got the red pepper hummus which was described as being accompanied by toasted nan, sliced cucumbers, radishes, and olives.  The Reality was the nan arrived warmed (maybe in the microwave even), and the olives were tapenade on top of the hummus. The veggies had been sliced at least many hours of not a day or two prior, and were not the crispiest I've ever had. Also, the hummus had a cumin flavor going on, and for my tastes, cumin does not play nicely with hummus.  Get ready for paying more, but overall I had a decent experience and recommend you give it a try."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this restaurant at all.. Got a chicken salad sandwich and it was so blahh. No flavor and I got so much bread it was overwhelming. Service was poor as well, took 15 min for my initial drink of water!"}
{"text":"Had the spinach salad with added steak.  Delicious.  Not cheap, but not bad for the airport.  Really tasty.  Will be back.  Service excellent.  Nice ambiance. Recommended."}
{"text":"Really nice, didn't even feel like we were in an airport, for just a little bit! It sets back from then main walk, so you don't see everyone rushing by. Just had a Ruben sandwich ,but was very good."}
{"text":"You will not be disappointed! Great place to relax and enjoy  a glass of wine and tapas while waiting for next flight!"}
{"text":"For an airport restaurant, this place is PERFECT. really hit the spot and exactly what I needed for my extended layover. I arrived around 9 AM, and they only serve breakfast at that time. I got a croissant with eggs, peppers, ham, and some grapes, it was definitely delicious!   The best part about the meal was definitely the coffee. It was a real French press, and was absolutely delicious.  My waiter was also very attentive, and was able to answer all my questions and kept on asking me if I still was on time for my flight. I definitely appreciated the reminders! If I ever layover through Charlotte again, I will definitely come again."}
{"text":"I have ate here many times while traveling and love it. The open faced sandwhiches are amazing and so filling. Also a fav is their asapragus salad and caprese salad apy. I have found myself ordering two orders of their chocolate truffles for dessert so don't be afraid to go for it. It is a bit pricey but its an airport so you come to expect it!"}
{"text":"I have a layover in Charlotte and wanted to sit down for a meal. The food here is fresh. I ordered the paprika chicken salad sandwich. The salad was ok but served on ciabatta bread so the effect was very dry.  The service is my complaint. They stuck me at a small table in a dark corner. The people at the next table ordered at the same time, but their food was served long before mine. I was not offered a drink refill and everything seemed to take twice as long as at the next table. Maybe I didn't spend enough or my server thought I wouldn't tip well. She was right, but her tip reflected the level of service I received."}
{"text":"Amazing!  Hands down the best airport restaurant!  I have been there 4 times, each has been fantastic.  Their food is amazing and service is great.   I actually look forward to flying in and out of Charlotte so I can eat here."}
{"text":"45 minutes between getting food and having to reach out to a manager to get a response. Never Again."}
{"text":"Really good food,  excellent for an airport!   So our choices were late lunch in the small town we were staying at or come to the airport early.  Hint: the Ruby Tuesday 5 star rating in the little town made this a no brainer. I had the prosecco with peach drink and my husband had the Southern flight (a tequila drink). Both nice,  but pricey at ~$14 (but I've had some pretty terrible airport drinks at that cost...I'm taking about YOU RDU and YOU MCO). Red pepper humus was delicious.  We had a salad and salmon sandwich,  both excellent.  Dessert was berries and chocolate which was assorted berries with whipped cream and thin,  milk chocolate.  Worth the price for the quality of the food,  especially at an airport!"}
{"text":"Beaudevin-All the beauty of wine.   Great place for a quick bite or a more leisurely tasting while waiting for take off.  This is my favorite spot for this in the Charlotte Airport offering wine tasting and tapas/small plates.  Caprese Skewers- The caprese skewers are served over arugula with a pleasantly sweet balsamic reduction that complements the peppery arugula well.  A simple but delicious and fresh lite plate.    Knowing the caprese skewers were on the lite side, I also got the shrimp scampi.  Together, these two small plates hit the spot.    Shrimp Scampi- The scampi comes with 8 shrimp in a nice scampi broth with onion, tomato, and a garnish of cilantro. Six pieces of baguette are served on the side for you to sop up the yummy scampi broth.  At first I thought it would have been nice to have 8 pieces of baguette to go with the 8 shrimp, but I was able to make it work and still had some left over to do some broth sopping.  The baguettes are just a little bigger than the shrimp making them perfectly bite size.  One thing to note: if you're not a cilantro fan, you'll want to ask for the cilantro to be left off.  It's not included in the menu description, but there's a generous garnish of cilantro on the scampi.  I enjoyed the cilantro, though there was a lot of it.   I did not partake in the wine or any of the great sounding cocktails.  There's  a nice selection of them."}
{"text":"I had the worst turkey Reuben of my life at Beaudevin.The \"turkey\" was slimy and shredded and could have come out of a can. The sauerkraut and thousand island dressing were so sparse I could barely detect their presence. This was a Reuben by chef boyardee. This was a Reuben so bad I wish I could have ritually sacrificed it in a fiery pit. This wasn't a Reuben, it was an impostor, a flavorless Reuben shaped lump masquerading as the sandwich we all know and love so much.  The \"mini wedge salad\" was a bunch of wet iceberg lettuce with some chopped up tomatoes and cucumbers. Nothing that resembled dressing was present.   Service was quick and waiter was polite. If you're just getting a drink, this place is fine. But get a pretzel at Auntie Anne's next door if you're hungry. Or get a Whopper at BK--at least you know what you're getting and it doesn't cost $20."}
{"text":"While on a 2.5 hour layover, four sleepy ladies happened upon Beaudevin thanks to the yelp reviews... and thank goodness for that! Now, if Beaudevin were in Charlotte itself, it would garner a three star review.  The food was fairly good (brunch) and the cocktails were well designed and 3 for 4 on the successful scale... but what sets the review to a 4 is the location.  Its in an airport.  AN AIRPORT RESTAURANT THAT IS ACTUALLY GOOD?!?!?!    amazing- and unprecedented in aviation history.  service was excellent, seats were comfy, silverware/glassware was fancy.  this is the ONLY place you should grab a bite while on a layover.   I would even consider not flying direct if it meant a stop at CDI."}
{"text":"Beaudevin made my 2.5 hour layover in the Charlotte airport fly by (pun intended).  I was having such a good time sitting there drinking my wine and eating my cheese that I almost didn't want to leave when it was time for my flight.  If it was anywhere else, I'd say it's 4 stars, but because it's in an airport terminal, and by miles the best restaurant ever in an airport terminal, it gets 5 stars.  There's bar seating as well as a small area with couches and normal tables, and I opted for a table with outlets nearby so that I could charge up all my electronics.  The service was amazing.. the hostess/waitress stopped by to make sure I was always taken care of with drinks, water, food, etc and when I asked for the bill she offered to charge my card at the same time, since she knew I was hurrying to make a flight (after sitting there casually for 2 hours I almost missed it ha).  They have an extensive wine list and every food menu item has a suggested pairing.  I had the open faced chicken sandwich which was absolutely delicious.  It came with 4 pieces of bread topped so it was a generous serving size for the price.  Because it was so good, I knew that I wanted to try something else here. So I decided to overeat and also had a small cheese plate paired with the suggested Riesling.  The small cheese plate is also very generous for the price, and probably would have been enough for me as a meal. I still ate most of it.  With the AA / US Airways merger now underway, I may be spending a lot more time there. Because of Beaudevin, that's now an okay thing."}
{"text":"Beaudevin is a delightful escape in the Charlotte airport.  Hidden from traffic and noise by the much more pedestrian on the go bar, this chic wine bar features a rather robust wine list that is paired quite nicely with the tapas style menu.  When you walk in an L-shaped bar is on the left with ample tables on the right.  The wine menu is more genorous than the food, but both are excellent.  I would say the only draw back is that the wine glasses are a little over priced and the none of the dishes on the menu where robust enough for a hearty pallet.    All in all Beaudevin is everything you wouldn't expect inside an airport.  Good food, artfully done with pretty reliable accuracy paired with a rather impressive wine list.  Flying fancy free in Charlotte with a littlke time to kill - dine fine at Beaudevin."}
{"text":"Wine fan? In the airport too early in order to avoid the long lines at airport security? Hungry?  This is your place. For an airport wine bar, the selection is good. The menu sandwich selections are not bad. The service is attentive, and they are good providers. Try the flatbread pizza.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Really great for airport food. I absolutely loved their shrimp cocktail. I was also a big fan of the bellini that I got there. Would definitely be my choice of somewhere to eat while at the Charlotte airport."}
{"text":"If I have to go through CLT I'm stopping here.  I prefer breakfast and coffee here but a glass of wine, sandwich and salad hits just right too!"}
{"text":"Surprising oasis in the midst of typical terminal fare. An amazing by the glass selection of premium wines coupled with a select menu of small plates and gourmet sandwiches. Upscale decor and service are the icing on the cake."}
{"text":"Disappointing experience. The hostess stood at the stand and ignored us for several minutes until finally staring at us--which is when we then asked for a table for 2. She never spoke a word to us. Our food was mediocre at best...our drinks came out about 10 mins after our food and they were definitely underwhelming especially for the steep price. This is our home airport and we don't intend to return."}
{"text":"While traveling with my daughter, we had a long layover in Charlotte. Desperate to find something better than the typical chain restaurant, we found Beaudevin. We were seated away from the noisy concourse.  I had the open faced roasted vegetable and goat cheese sandwich. The zucchini seemed a bit more pickled than roasted. The fava bean salad served with it was divine. I had the suggested paired wine that worked well!  My daughter decided to skip the late supper and have the berries and chocolate. It was a gorgeous presentation (yes, at the airport) and was delicious. Simon was a perfect waiter, bringing what we needed when it was needed. Our portions were generous, beautiful and tasty. It seemed no more expensive  than any airport meal and much better than any other restaurant options."}
{"text":"You definitely don't feel like you are in the airport. But to that point as well the servers move a bit slow for being an airport spot. I know some people have really long layovers but some are stopping in for a quick bite before they need to catch their plane. The prices are not cheap here but I feel like that is to be expected. I ended up going with their open face veggie sandwich with goat cheese. The sandwich was suppose to have zucchini but they were out so it just had artichoke. It was amazing! The bread was delicious and all the sandwich toppings worked so well with the goat cheese.   If you have some time while you are at CLT I definitely recommend stopping in here to eat."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian I was passing by every breakfast place looking for something more than an egg and cheese biscuit for breakfast.  I was just about to lose hope and then just like the gates of heaven - there it was!  I'm so pleased I found this place.  Sparkling mimosas and a fresh made veggie scramble with fresh fruit a buttery flaky croissant- yes please!!  And my waitress was so pleasant!!  It was also beautiful inside too.  The menu looked as if it had plenty of veggie options for any time of the day!  If I'm ever back in this airport I will not waste my time looking anywhere else and go straight here!  I give it 5 stars for being airport food for sho!!"}
{"text":"So I wandered in here based on the yelp reviews.  I have never been let let down by my fellow yelpers and this restaurant is no exception.  The reviews rate it head and shoulders above the other eateries in the airport and I agree. In my opinion if a restaurant can nail the service, food and ambiance then it's all good in my book.  When you step in here you wouldn't know that you are in a airport anymore.  The ambiance is relaxing with a cool green interior.  Sitting at the bar with my back to the airport, I feel like I stepped into a cozy neighborhood restaurant.  The wine selection is excellent and there are plenty of delicious items on the menu.  Friendly and super fast service is very appreciated at the airport and I was thankful on both counts here.  I will definitely come back and would recommend for anyone interested in tasty food with a relaxing glass of wine that takes the stress of travel away for the time you are here."}
{"text":"4 stars for the quality and ambiance  This is a really nice sanctuary for an airport. Thankfully it wasn't too dark otherwise I might have fallen asleep at the bar. Quiet, reserved, classy is how I'd describe this place - especially for an airport restaurant. I had the Scottish Smoked Sandwich and it was great. The bread was made fresh that day and they were still slicing it (see pict). The salad was weak but that's ok as the sandwich made up for it. Not a bunch of beer on tap but they focus on wine hence, the name. Cheapest red wine for a 9oz pour was $10 though that's probably not bad. Jimmy the bartender was really friendly and offered me a sample of the chicken salad. I'm fairly particular about chicken salad as I can't stand heavy mayo based foods such as macaroni salad, smoked fish spread, etc. With that being said, I was quite pleased when I tasted it. The crunchy pecans, ripe grapes, and smoked paprika was a great combination. I'd put this place at 5 stars (for airport fare) if the prices were a little better."}
{"text":"I'd first like to say THANK YOU to Beaudevin to building in outlets underneath the bar tops.  That's worth 5 stars alone.  I always need to charge my phone while traveling.  Now on to the food.  I split the goat cheese and brushetta and the hummus with a friend.  The goat cheese / brushetta wasn't what I was expecting.  I was picturing a typical warm goat cheese and tomato dish that's available in most tapas restaurants.  This was whipped goat cheese in a bowl next to a pile of brushetta topping served with baguette slices.  It was good.  It wasn't super flavorful, but I liked it.  The hummus was delicious and served with veggies and pita.  My friend and I both got our own salads.  I got the Mediterranean, and she got the Artichoke salad.  We both enjoyed them and left feeling full but not overly stuffed.  Great amount of food for 2 people.  For those who like wine, they have  a great wine selection - probably around 25-30 different wines.    Enjoy!"}
{"text":"When I have a long layover in Charlotte, I try to have dinner here. I have had the Charcuterie and Artisan Cheese plates and the smoked salmon tartine. All were so delicious. I seem to sit in the same seat every time and enjoy the view and people watching. I have noticed that you can order the sushi from In Flight and have it delivered to your table. A;ways a nice experience."}
{"text":"\"Khristen was very friendly and made aborting layover into a tasty and fun treat. Only problem is there isn't one in Columbus, OH. Great place.\""}
{"text":"Are here for lunch, sat at the bar.  Bartender/server was prompt and courteous.  Had a Macallan12 single and then a Sauvignon Blanc which were great.   I ordered the charcuterie salad and the Cabernet steak and mushrooms; I was not a fan. The salad had too many different flavors that clashed; prosciutto, raw string beans, and cranberries just didn't mesh well. The steak/mushroom.. well the Cabernet sauce was pretty good.. but it was very..edible but that's about it.   Maybe their dinner menu is better with all the great reviews about steak but my lunch was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, the bar has been set for airport terminal dining and I mean dining not just eating.  This place has it all: good food, ambience, and good service.  First of all, the decor is upscale and inviting.  With wine being a focus of this establishment, the wine bottles dominate the walls, very nice.  The menu is way upscale from the norm.  My Greek wedge salad had a beautiful presentation with three wedges along a long rectangular plate.  It was topped with a lemon vinaigrette, feta, red quinuoa (sp), and herbs.  It was delicious and filling.  I should not have ordered the turkey rueben.  It was not great and the salad had filled me.    They serve wine by the fluid ounce, brilliant.  You can order a little or a lot.  My NC Sauvignon(sp) was crisp and refreshing.  My server was friendly and attentive.  This is a great place to relax in the middle of a long trip.  It is pricier than the normal airport fare, but I found it worthwhile.  BTW, wouldn't it be great if Yelp had a spell checker that was food terminology friendly?"}
{"text":"Finally good food at CLT!  It's wonderful to be able to get a good open face sandwich during a layover.  The quality is great but it is airport priced.    Don't miss the berry dessert chocolate thing!  The restaurant is a bit hidden right behind the big airplane mobile in the center bridge between B and C concourse.    This looks like just a wine bar but the tapas are really good."}
{"text":"This is, in my opinion, the best restaurant in the Charlotte airport. They have a delicious selection of small dishes, mostly meats and cheeses, and a very good breakfast menu. The atmosphere is pleasant, the location is perfect (in the main terminal), and the service is always very attentive.   My favorite dishes are the charcuterie plate and the baguettes with goat cheese and tomato spread... both are awesome.   BOTTOM LINE: Best dining option in CLT."}
{"text":"A very fun wine place in the airport. The various food options are great and go well with the wine! This is behind the security checkpoint."}
{"text":"After the clouds... there's always wine... cute, quaint restaurant in the #Charlotte concourse * #Beaudevin Love their mantra: 'All the beauty of Wine' they also have beautifully plated bites to go W your vins... Traveling to Europe w my family and encountered this lil gem as we enjoy our Layover... who enjoys layovers... well, this places definitely makes it possible!   Try their local wine if you get a chance, Biltmore Wines.  Your constant companion,  ~deirdra"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant at the airport. Great wine selection, excellent service, and good food. Not bad for an airport restaurant. It's located in the main ticketing/departure area. I think concourse C."}
{"text":"Beaudevin is a wine bar / tapas / sandwich place located within the Charlotte / Douglas International Airport.  The place is a little upscale, but cute!    I ordered the Goat Cheese Baguette and Tomato Soup.  I also tried their Strawberry Peach Bellini.  NOM NOM NOM!  My coworker also got their Artisan Cheese Plate.  Overall a great experience, but a little pricey.  ENJOY!!"}
{"text":"This is an oasis in the desert of airport food choices at Charlotte. The salad, salmon and flight of mousse were all very good but the sweetness of dessert was surpassed by the sweetness of my server Sarah."}
{"text":"If you're stuck in CLT during a layover (As I was for three hours on my way to LAS) this is a nice, quiet, comfortable place to enjoy some small portion tapas and a glass of wine/cocktail/cup of coffee away from the herds rushing to and from their CRJs.   I had the ceviche and roasted artichoke salad.   The Good; Service was excellent. The waitress was attentive and made every effort to come back and check in to see if I have everything I wanted.  The menu is head and shoulders more interesting and better for you than the options out in the food court. The layout and design of the seating offers you everything from a nice leather couch to the bar to standard tables with lovely cushioned chairs. Head and shoulders above any other establishment in this airport.   The Bad: While the menu is really interesting and has lots of tasty sounding options, the ingredients they are using are not the best. The Ceviches guacamole was dark and slimy and settled entirely to the bottom of the dish. The chicken I added was rubbery and pre-cooked, not nearly as nice as the salad itself. Also, hot tea may not be the most ordered item in a wine bar but considering the 'higher end' nature of this place having more than mint, english breakfast and earl grey doesn't take much effort.   Overall with a couple small additions this place wouldn't just be the nicest in the airport, it would be a standout anywhere."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to this location. The first was for lunch. The prices of the wine are very reasonable from small class medium pour to large pour. I had an excellent Chianti with my lunch. Had breakfast this morning - the flatbread was really good! Unfortunately on sundays they can't start serving alcohol until 10 am so no mimosa for me!"}
{"text":"Nice, quiet atmosphere, great wine list and good food. It can be tempting to get horrible fast food at an airport, especially since healthy options are rare. Beaudevin fills that void and makes you feel like you're not really at the airport at all.  They offer many small plates, which is nice because I don't want anything too heavy before a flight. I tried the Small Cheese Plate (4 cheeses, dried fruit and nuts, fruit jam, baguette), and it was a great complement to the local NC wine I was drinking. I also got the Hummus with Roasted Red Pepper, which came with a tomato/cucumber/olive side salad and pita. Also a great choice.  I would definitely come back if I'm at CLT again."}
{"text":"Lots of healthy veggie options for non-meat eaters.  Had a lovely light and fast meal here during a quick 1.5 hour layover in Charlotte today on the way between Florida and Virginia.   I have eyeballed this restaurant a few times while traveling through Charlotte but haven't really had enough time (or so I thought) to try it out.   Today I had the roasted red pepper hummus - served with sliced cucumbers, red peppers, warm naan bread and celery.  It was very good.  I enjoyed it as a nice light appetizer.   I saw a few things I could've been happy with as a main course from the sandwiches, and salads menu but I chose to get an open-faced sandwich which was smeared with a cheese spread then had a layer of spinach, roasted artichokes, tomatoes, and greens.  It was yummy and light.   Our server with very fast and polite - the food was out very quickly - and I did not feel bad at all about the meal.   I'll be sure to stop in again the next time I have time."}
{"text":"What a nice surprise! Being that this place is in an airport, I was more than skeptical.   I went on a Tuesday afternoon, when it was slower than normal. The restaurant and bar were nearly empty. I had the open-faced chicken sandwich. It was great: fast, fresh, and light. Service was excellent, and the menu had plenty of selections. I'm already looking forward to coming back and trying something different.    If this was in my neighborhood, I would go definitely go back. Definitely a good place to stop for those traveling through CLT. The best quality food you will likely find in an Airport anywhere."}
{"text":"The worst! Would it be redundant to say anything else? The service was non-existent since the employees spent all their time talking and laughing with each other than greeting the customers. I saw 2 others give up and leave due to the absence of service before I decided to toss in the towel and leave. I should get an award for hanging in there the longest, right?"}
{"text":"Ceviche was ok.. Not a whole lot of shrimp. Tasted like pickled tomatoes. The grilled artichoke salad was delightful... Would recommend. My neighbor's Gorgonzola flatiron steak sandwich looked even better! She raved about it so much that I was relieved when she left to catch her flight. I would return."}
{"text":"If you're stuck at CLT or need a meal while here, I suggest making a stop at Beaudevin in the main section of the terminal/food court (before you make the way to the gates, yet after security).  This restaurant has great wine and food pairing suggestions and you can enjoy small plate items or a red/white wine flight.  It's a comfortable place and, when the piano is going in the courtyard, you can enjoy the additional ambience.  There are plugs all along the bar (underneath) for your laptops.  I had a delicious white wine paired with their smoked salmon appetizer.  It made a perfect brunch for one."}
{"text":"Had the pesto chicken flatbread which was not bad. Pesto could have been fresher as it was lacking in real flavor.  This is a wine bar at heart not really Spanish tapas like I was expecting.  Very good seating and decent service."}
{"text":"This is a respectable establishment with a touch of class in an airport.  I should empasize an American airport, as they do not really compare well with Europe.  It is pretty noisy for a wine bar, but kind of quiet for an airport eatery.  To some extent, the prices keep the clientele at a level of sedation.  However, the need for a corporate base to sustain the atmosphere means the prices are actually quite shocking.  One six ounce pour is close to the retail bottle price.  I chose the Black and bleu sandwich with chips.  Though uninspired, it was satisfying.  I paired this with a glass of Sangiovese.    To follow, i chose the Carolina's Finest flight of savignon blanc, a white blend, and a cab (made with California grapes).  This was quite pleasant.  I added the three smallest truffles I had seen in a while.  Anyway, the sticker shock and industrial, managed ambiance rates a middle of the road review.  It still may be the best in the airport.   Eat well, tip well."}
{"text":"Fantastic wine list, even by the glass! And a classy menu, too. I was travelling alone, and was able to score a small table next to a wall outlet so I could charge my laptop while I enjoyed a couple of glasses during my long layover. My filet was cooked to a perfect medium rare, and I was able to order a $37 GLASS of amazing pinot. The service was attentive and prompt - which is always appreciated in an airport, when people are running tight schedules. I'll definitely return during every layover I have in CLT!"}
{"text":"After walking past so many disappointing & artery clogging food choices in the airport (Burger King, Papa John's, Bojangles..), I came across this restaurant, kind of tucked away in the middle of the food court and it seemed like a MIchelin star space compared to all the other options. It was quiet and relaxing, and helped make my delayed flight layover more bearable.  There was a good selection of food - 4 open faced sandwiches, 4 salads, and a wide variety of tapas and cheese & charcuteries. I opted for the Green Apple Salad ($11) with chicken (+$4) - it was a decent size and had arugula, crushed marcona almonds, and apples. It was light, refreshing and delicious. I would skip on the chicken - it was a bit on the rubbery side (almost like the \"fake\" chicken you get at Subway).   I got a little plate of cheese for $4 with 5-6 slices of bread, which was a nice snack.  I think this is definitely one of the healthiest and nicest options to eat at in this airport - having paid $11 before for burnt chicken, or $11 for a CPK Pizza or Chili's salad, these prices for a nice sit-down meal are not too bad. Fork over the extra few dollars to eat here, and pay for service, and enjoy your layover so you don't spend your next flight wishing you hadn't eaten all that fast food.  5 stars for a great airport restaurant - you almost forget you are even in the airport!"}
{"text":"A nice escape in the Charlotte Airport. Tucked away behind the center court bar, this little gem is quiet and serene providing a nice break from the hustle and bustle of the airport. It's not cheap, but I enjoyed the meal.   Service was efficient, but not overly attentive. It's obvious they are more attuned to travelers rushing for a flight than those wishing to linger.   I ordered the cheese plate and Farmer's Salad. The salad was wonderful; field greens with pumpkin seeds, shredded beets and goat cheese. I would have like bigger chunks of beet as the shreds didn't impart that great beer flavor. There was a nice balance of goat cheese on the salad. Topped with a vinaigrette it was a nice overall salad.   The cheese plate was also good. 3 cheeses including a nice Brie and blue. Also on the plate Marconna almonds, dried fruit and apricot jam. My only complaint - I would have liked some crackers or more bread. I ran out of bread before I ran out of cheese and the server was no where to be found to see if I could get more   Overall, a nice respite on amid the chaos and a nice surprise."}
{"text":"Some of the better food I've had in an airport.   Seems like they have a great wine selection also.  I had the \"morning tartine\" and it was great.  Basically an open faced sourdough sandwich with scrambled eggs on it and two slices of bacon.  I got a side of cheese with it."}
{"text":"I literally just ordered a salad WITH steak, paid $17. I was in a rush to get to my gate so I grabbed the bag she handed me and ran (it took 20 minutes to get my salad). I got to my gate, and there wasn't any steak. I paid an extra $7 for nothing!!! Not to mention I have a 5 hour flight with some lettuce to tide me over! Grrrrrr!"}
{"text":"Had one of their open-faced tartine sandwiches last night.  DELISH, fresh bread, drizzled olive oil.  I was originally tempted by the fast food smells next door, but thankfully chose this place again.  Fresh and healthy, and I felt good about myself when I got home.   The lady next to me had the charcuterie plate - also delish (looking!).     I have had multiple good experiences here.  Very consistent."}
{"text":"What a nice surprise! A tasty selection of wine and small plates in an airport. The space is beautiful and the hummus and smoked salmon plates were excellent. Smooth jazz playing and a nice selection of wines. Very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"2 stars for food quality. I understand it's an airport and they have limited kitchen staff and equipment but your \"steak\" is downright gross. I ordered the caprese salad and added the steak. It is not cooked to temp and only served one way. It was more like a subway styled, bagged and microwaved, oversalted mess. Was really disappointed. STAY AWAY from the steak. Salad dressing was extremely heavy and the balsamic was overly sweet.   Good place for pre flight beverage but be very selective with your food choice. Service was prompt and friendly!"}
{"text":"This place had really tasty small dishes. And I'm not judging that on a scale of \"airport food.\" I mean these were legitimately tasty, not just I will shove something in my face and dash for the next plane good.  I had a goat cheese bruschetta, and my mom had the olive and baguette plate. Not sure that is what they are on the menu... but that was roughly what was on the plates. Tasty goodnes.  I had a red wine as did my mom. I believe it was a red blend from Biltmore. It hit the spot.   Thanks for having this swanky little spot in your airport! Hit the spot just right before my flight out!"}
{"text":"I ate the tasting menu which was a delicious pork tenderloin with three sides. The dish was great and especially nice for airport food. There are healthy options which is rare. The wines looked delicious. I would eat here every time through Charlotte."}
{"text":"After packing in a rush, cooking some pasta for myself, and forgetting the olive oil, I tried to track some down at the airport. Even though I offered to pay, the servers gave me what I need for free. So friendly!"}
{"text":"The cheese board was pretty good for an airport. The ambiance was great, and it's centrally located in the atrium. The steak was a boiled concoction, instead of a standard steak. The service was poor. I had to ask for water refills, I had to go to the bar to get Splenda. When I needed the check, as my flight was boarding, the server was unavailable. The restaurant was somewhat slow when I was there, so it's not like busyness could explain the poor service."}
{"text":"I'm traveling a lot lately and I always have a layover in Charlotte. But when I don't have a layover, I always try to find a similar experience as Beaudevin. This might be, the best airport restaurant in America.  I mostly go in and eat something light like their flatbreads. They are always cripsy and full of flavor, no matter which one you order. The wine selection is great and not expensive considering you are in an airport.  The staff will always recognize people that come through a lot.   Pro tip: They have outlets at the bar but they are hidden against the top."}
{"text":"Great meal while waiting for my flight and not to heavy, but hit the spot. Service was very friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"Just avoid.  Ordered the grinder with a side salad.  The sandwich had been pre-made and came right out of the refrigerator.  The salad was lettuce with some cucumber thrown on top, & bland dressing.  After sitting at the bar for several minutes, I was told by a waiter, that if I moved to the other end of the bar I would probably get better service.  There were only 3 people at the bar, but apparently, you don't get served at that end.  I moved.  The bartender was still nonexistent.  The sandwich & a bloody came to $30.  I'm not usually one to complain about prices if you get your money's worth.  This place did not deliver.  The bloody was pretty good, though."}
{"text":"I almost didn't bother coming in here because the breakfast menu posted at the door didn't have prices, the place looked super fancy for an airport and the dinner menu was expensive.  However, I got a much better breakfast than I would have anywhere else in the airport, and it only cost $10 for my entree.  The cost was excellent, the environment was laid back and the server busted her behind to give great service to the entire restaurant.  Also, I aksed for a side of sourdough instead of the croissant.  I'm from the San Francisco area and the sourdough they gave me was delicious!!"}
{"text":"I had a longer layover in Charlotte so I decided to give this place a try based on previous yelp reviews and I am sure glad that I did. They have several wine flights too choose from. I chose the Carolina favorites wine flight and it was great!  They even provide an explanation of each of the wines you get in the coaster which was pretty cool. This makes it easier for me to purchase a bottle of wine that I liked. I had the chicken paprika salad and it was great!  It didn't have has much mayonnaise as some chicken salads do so enjoyed that. If I am traveling through Charlotte again and have a long enough layover, I will be back!"}
{"text":"Charlotte is the famous home of layovers for most US Airways flights, and this lovely wine bar makes unexpected delays a pleasant surprise. Not even being sarcastic here.   A co-worker and I used a small 1.5hr layover in Charlotte to swing by (it's between major terminals) to grab a quick bite to eat. The interactive iPad set up tells you a lot about the wine options available. The waitress was also spectacular at recommended local North Carolinian white wines to taste. She was also more than willing to give samples, which was nice.   In the way of food, we grabbed the cheese plate. The apple compote, cheese, dried fruit, and bread was a great add on and filled two of us up for lunch. (Not the most filling, but it was enough to tide us over for four more hours.)   Nice bonus: there was a grand piano outside the restaurant, which someone played. Not sure if he was hired or just another traveler on a layover, but it was fabulous!"}
{"text":"Really really great. Had the Smoked Paprika Chicken Salad sandwich and it was delicious. It came with a side wedge salad all for $13. To me, it was well worth the upgrade over some other fast food spot."}
{"text":"Very good for an airport restaurant.  Enjoyed a couple of glasses of a wonderful Napa Pinot from their nice wine menu and a great grilled vegetable and goat cheese open faced sandwich.  Ma really nice relaxing escape from loud hectic airport land when you have a layover.  Dim lights and very friendly service.  Love it."}
{"text":"A glass of wine and some appetizers is a perfect way to start your trip. Try their flute of wines. 3 reds or 3 whites or 3 local varieties. Fast service. I leave for airport a little early so that I can take my time here."}
{"text":"Given the typical airport food joints, Beaudevin is a breath of fresh air in the midst of CLT's chaos. Great place to spend some time in between flights. Wine list is pretty good and the small plates are perfect pairings."}
{"text":"120 Outlets under bar! Very good smoked salmon sandwich. Wine options pricey with 3,6,9 oz pours."}
{"text":"When it comes to airport food, there generally aren't many great options. It's usually a mixture of chain restaurant or something of equal or lesser quality. Then there's Beaudevin.  I don't know where this place came from. I can't even find a website. It's almost like it was quietly placed here by a divine Airport God as our reward for dealing with TSA's across the lands. This is easily the best and fanciest place I've eaten at Any airport.   I ordered a bagel with a side of all the necessary ingredients for a lox bagel combination creation (herbed cream cheese, capers, red onions, tomatoes and smoked salmon). Everything tasted fresh enough for my liking. The salmon was great. Mind. Blown.   If you're flying into Charlotte and have some time to spare, check it out. I read they also have one in Chicago O' Hare and Miami. Travelers rejoice!"}
{"text":"The farmers salad and then add smoked salmon is perfection. It's a great tarty salad with very fresh ingredients. They top is with crumbled soft goat cheese, shaved beets, and sunflower seeds or pepitas. The smoke salmon was not overly salty as to most smoked salmon I've had. The texture was almost comparable to fresh fish.   Farmers salad: 11 Smoked salmon: 5.5  10/10 is be back again during my next visit to the CLT airport.   I wish I could have dined in to enjoy the Romaric atmosphere (romantic for an airport restaurant). Maybe when I can bring a hot date ;)"}
{"text":"Always surprised to find a restaurant avec edible food at an airport. (That was French. See what I did there?) And was just about to despair that there wasn't anything at all I wanted to eat at CLT. Here is relief in the form of lunch.  My turkey Reuben was pretty good. Service was very good, and eating at the bar was comfortable. Prices in airport money (real prices x 1.33) were reasonable, but higher than what you'd spend at the BBQ place next door.   Go there."}
{"text":"Never got to eat. Once I told the mannequin like hostess I would sit at the bar and did exactly that I was ignored by not one but two employees behind the bar for some strange reason and after ten minutes got up and left.  Maybe next trip. ;0)"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I have wildly different ideas about what a timely arrival at the airport entails. I want to be there in enough time to account for any traffic / long line / drug sniffing dog finds you interesting disaster. He, who travels all the time, believes it all works out in the end so there's no reason to sit around bored for hours. However, I am hoping Beaudevin will bring him closer to my way of thinking. Why? Because it is actually a rather pleasant experience to sit here with some wine and small plates.   Other times I've had wine at the airport it has been served in an odd shaped plastic glass. Not so at Beaudevin where my 9oz pour was brought in a proper wine glass with room for the red wine to mellow a little bit. They also have delicious looking small plates. We were having dinner at our destination but my fiancé bought me a chocolate truffle tray as a surprise snack. Wine, chocolate and a comfortable seat is all I really want from life in or outside of an airport.   Yes, it is a little pricy but considering it is in the airport it wasn't out of line with some of the equally pricy but nowhere near as elegant options at the Charlotte airport."}
{"text":"WAY overrated. Ridiculous wine prices and very mediocre food. Not sure who they are paying for all the glowing reviews but I say don't waste your time or your $. Plenty of other reliable restaurants in the airport including Burger King which would have been a better option if they sold wine."}
{"text":"Expensive and gross!  Service was super slow.  Only the wine is good, otherwise I would have given it one star.  I ordered the steak and mushrooms.  Flavor was good, but steak was sliced paper-thin with a mandolin and heated in the watery sauce.  What does that produce, you might ask?  Boiled meat!  Stay away.  There are better bets at CLT...I just haven't found them yet.  I'll keep trying!"}
{"text":"I would love to write a great review. They had what I was craving during my nearly 2 hour layover (hummus plate) and the peach bellini was tasty. But the service was terrible! I had to beg for more hummus and getting a second drink was nearly impossible."}
{"text":"This place is great for airport food. It is a little expensive, sure, but you are getting what you pay for.   I had a glass of wine and a chicken salad sandwich and really enjoyed it. The service was attentive but not overwhelming and the hostess sat me at a table right next to an outlet (as I had asked). If I am in Charlotte again I will definitely be back here. There is a ton of room to lounge and drink and have a tasty bite to eat (especially if you are stuck in a long layover like I was)."}
{"text":"Had a lovely glass of peach Bellini and a delicious, buttery - crunchy Mediterranean flatbread while trying to cope with a delayed flight. The food was great and so was the service. Wish I could have tried more options from their wine menu"}
{"text":"The setting was very cool and that's what attracted me to this place, all the other places here were just mall style restaurants and this place was definitely more private and felt it would have some good food. But the food was so-so, a more costumed panera bread, the beer was pretty good though."}
{"text":"If you get through security with time to spare, this is where you spend it.  We did in fact get through with plenty of time to spare so each had a glass of wine.  I was impressed with the wine menu for where it is.  Just to the right as you pass through security by A B.  It was the perfect place to go before boarding!  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"An absolute oasis of sophistication and class in the middle of this very congested airport.  Nestled between a Cinnebun and a Starbucks this is definitely the place to hang out between flights especially during long layovers.  We had excellent service great wine and a very tasty dessert. I'm only sorry that I wasted my time somewhere else for a stumbled upon this place.."}
{"text":"Healthy and delicious treat during a layover. After a red-eye flight, the quiet breakfast sanctuary was welcome. Eggs were cooked perfectly. Coffee was strong and fresh - nearly espresso like. Just what we needed after a red eye! Server was nice and quick with our service without rushing us. We would eat here again!"}
{"text":"Good breakfast- disappointed that we missed lunch or dinner.  Definitely go with the Breakfast Flatbread!  Delicious and unique!  Florentine eggs are more like an omelet.  Prosciutto Scramble has cubed meat that looks more like diced pancetta."}
{"text":"Unfortunately if you're looking for a place to work in the food court area, good luck. The outlets in the poles have been disabled, so there's no electricity. With that said, this restaurant has outlets, and per my request, I was seated at a table next to one. Since I had a 2.5-hour layover, I had plenty of time to get some work done.  I really liked this place. The service was excellent. When I explained to the waitress I had a long layover during which I would work on my laptop, she immediately understood and only came around to refill my water. Sometimes at a restaurant I am bothered too much by staff, but this was thankfully not the case at Beaudevin.  Best of all, the Scottish Salmon open-faced sandwich ($15.70 including tax) was delicious! At first glance, you would think that perhaps it's not enough food, but I struggled to eat the second half! The salmon was fresh, the herbs were just right, and the bread (raisin bread?) had enough sweetness to give more flavor. All of the flavors were balanced, and I really liked it. The presentation was remarkable (see photo), and I think all restaurants should strive to be like this, regardless if in an airport or not!  The food, great service, and the calming atmosphere in a chaotic place was wonderful. I would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Great value and delicious breakfast scramble. Put Des Moines food offering and pricing to shame. Definitely stop in if you are in the area"}
{"text":"Beautiful meal tucked away in the midst of a busy airport. Delicious, fast and gorgeous setting. Thankful for my friends on Yelp who encouraged me to check it out. I tried the farmers salad with chicken. It was amazing. Light dressing and tender, seasoned chicken. Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"This is a newer place in the Charlotte airport. New to me, anyway. Perfect place to stop in for a glass of wine, and try something new without making an investment in the whole bottle. They have flights as well. Get it? Flights. In the airport.   Anyway, very good service on this trip - I sat at the bar and was greeted immediately by a friendly, knowledgeable bartender. But not so friendly as to be intrusive. He did a perfect job of reading his guests, as I noticed that he engaged more with folks who wanted that. Most of us were just engrossed in our phones, lol. So shocking for a Yelper."}
{"text":"Perhaps the best airport restaurant I have ever been to. Nice, almost swanky but casual setting instead of the predictable sports bar concept. Good food and good service. Price is what prevents it from being five-star. Their namesake wine was about triple the price you would expect, so we stuck to beer...good to be an omnivore! At $18, the chilled lump crab cocktail was a relative deal. Elegant, minimalist preparation showcased the high quality ingredients. Wife enjoyed her turkey melt."}
{"text":"Of the experiences I've had in airport restaurants/bars, this is one of the more positive ones. I had a lengthy layover due to a delay as I was heading out to Nashville for vacation... my friends were already out enjoying happy hour, which meant I needed a jumbo glass wine to cure my FOMO. They delivered! I had a glass of rosé - I opted for the larger pour, which was about a glass and a half. I grabbed food as well, going for something heartier than the cheeseboard that I really wanted, but I need a true meal after a long day of traveling so I ordered the chicken blt sandwich. It was panini in essence with grilled focaccia bread, tomato and spinach. I ate the whole thing and it filled me up! The salad on the side was lightly dressed with a sweet citrus dressing.   The service was speedy, which is what you want in an airport dining experience. It was nice to sit down and feel like I was in a restaurant-like environment even though it was an airport. A worthwhile break from a long travel day."}
{"text":"This restaurant looks like an upscale 5 stars restaurant. The price confirm that it should be a 5 stars restaurant but the food is not!!! I had the small chacuterie plate which prosciutto which tasted the same as the low quality you would find in any supermarket. Then I had the steack with mushrooms in a cabernet sauce, which tested horribly!!! It was more like a extrimely sour soup with piece of iron steack that had no test whatsoever and some white mushrooms. I return the main course and had the iron cheese blue steak instead! The bread was so chewy that I could bet it was wramed up in macrowave. The only positive experience was the service! If you have too much money to spend on crappy food this is your place. By the way this the 3rd time in my life that I returned food to the kitchen!!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for breakfast while on a layover. Given the other choices in the area, this was the least greasy option. I had the egg salad croissant and it was pretty good. It came out pretty quick but getting the attention of the server was difficult even though there were at least 3 of them to cover the 3-4 people in the restaurant. I did finally get the attention of one of the staff to ask for a coffee refill but was told my server will be back later and I'd have to wait for her....for a coffee refill. 10 minutes later she came around. 4 stars for the food but minus 1 for the service.  Overall, I'd come here again for the food but not if I didn't have at least 45 min to kill."}
{"text":"REALLY did not expect to find a place this nice and relaxing in an airport of all places. But first off, let me say that I've been in some nice European airports and Charlotte is putting them to shame.   Wandered in here to a beautiful little restaurant softly lit, dabbled with plants that has an amazing array of wine to choose from. Sat in the mock 'al fresco' area where a piano player plays right by the entrance on the concourse.  They also serve several local North Carolina wines if you are so inclined to try. Ceviche, fancy paninis, cheese platters, and melon wrapped in prosciutto are all perfect  menu accompaniments. Little on the pricey side, but infinitely better than lurking at the Starbucks. If you have a layover, Beaudevin is absolutely the best spot in CTL to wait it out."}
{"text":"Nice designed restaurant. Lots of fine furniture, fixtures, and desgn. Not for children and not for travelers looking for casual food or bro attitude. Designed for a higher-dollar traveler and that's fine.   Extensive wine list. YES!  However, in my one experience, the food failed. Ordered Shrimp Scampi and some chicken flatbread. Weird and disappointing. The shrimp came out in a small hot skillet, but I was quite puzzled because it looked like a sizzling pan of large shrimp in boiling water with onions and other spices. This *ISN'T* shrimp scampi. Scampi, in my experience, has at least some white wine, garlic and butter. This whatever they brought out had NONE of that. Basically about 10 shrimps in a sizzling pan of hot spiced water. What can I say?  The flatbread. Disappointing. It's such an easy dish to prepare. It was soggy, and basically prepared very poorly. Very little mozerella and tomatoes, and some chopped up chicken breast on Indian naan. Fail.  I asked the waitress Is this supposed to be Shrimp Scampi, because it isn't. Immediately she responded back to ask if I wanted to order something else instead. I said I don't know. She came back a few minutes later and again I asked her about the dish and she said, Yeah, well that's what our cook labeled it as, scampi. She just laughed a bit and ran off.  For a nice upscale refuge such as this was hoping to be, I think they failed in the food department. Maybe it was an off night, who knows. It was a Tuesday evening about 730PM."}
{"text":"I researched a place to eat before my layover so that I would have one less thing to worry and stress over when I was there. I had a two hour layover and am so thankful to have found this relaxing restaurant.  The atmosphere was fantastic. Unless you were looking right out into the terminal/food court, you would never know that you were at an airport.  I did not want to have anything too large before I flew the second leg of my trip, so I opted for two of their tapas. I ordered the spinach fondue & cantaloupe prosciutto plate. The spinach fondue was delicious! The bread it came with was some of the best naan bread I have ever had and it was deliciously hot. The cantaloupe prosciutto was the perfect sized dish. It was cantaloupe wrapped in prosciutto topped with shaved Parmesan and balsamic. There were strawberries served on the side. I also ordered a glass of Moscato. The prices were fair for being in an airport. The service was right on par- attentive but not pushy/nosy, prompt and extremely friendly.   I would highly recommend this place to anyone traveling through Charlotte Airport."}
{"text":"The best you will find in an airport!  So worth  it.  Take a moment to relax and put your feet up!"}
{"text":"This is the best airport restaurant I've ever been to. The food, service and ambience allow you to forget where you are, which when in an airport during the holidays, is nothing short of a miracle.   I had fruit with greek yogurt and granola. It is served deconstructed and everything was fresh and in season. It was actually a healthy breakfast! With flavor! In an airport! I also ordered a side of bacon which was clearly made to order; it was hot, crisp yet tender and melted in my mouth. The coffee is excellent too, they brew it by the cup so your refills are always fresh.   My server was friendly and knowledgeable. The next time I am at CLT I will definitely stop here."}
{"text":"Would have loved to try the food and wine but not one person came our way to take our order for 15 minutes after being seated. Was disappointed so we just left."}
{"text":"Got stuck in the Charlotte airport for the second year in a row. The food here is really great. However, got my bill and had ordered the 9oz house cab...$30!!! No disclaimer, not acceptable. So disappointed...Come for the food but don't expect average for the wine cost"}
{"text":"Completely unexpected gem!! Fantastic wine selection and great food!!! My 8 hour layover just got so much better!!!"}
{"text":"This wine bar was a gem to find while passing by the charlotte airport! Amazing service (thank you Britney) and nice relaxing ambiance. The wine and food menu has so much to choose from you won't go home thirsty or hungry!"}
{"text":"This place is as French as Paris, Texas. Please go to Quiznos or the sushi place instead."}
{"text":"Wow. This place is amazing. I can honestly say this was one of the best most joyful meal I've had in a while. I had the melon and proscutto with a fig balsamic glaze topped with fresh parmesano reggiano and mint oil. followed by an open roasted chicken sandwich with fresh peppers, dry aged vella jack, arugala, avacado crema, on artisan bread. I have to admit I wasn't fully excited about the truffles, tasted like they might have been made fresh then frozen, but that won't hinder my rating. The appetizer and main course was so damn good I have no complaints. I would come here if I was at the airport or just passing through it was that good. Compliments to the chef and staff were super great. I'll be back I'm sure."}
{"text":"This has become a normal stop for us and considering our small local airport only flies to Charlotte we are here quite often. I've never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"This is a very nice restaurant that happens to be located in the middle of the airport. Not sure why this is rather undiscovered but it is an oasis of calm even when the rest of the airport is not. Great drinks, top notch wine selection and good food! I've enjoyed everything I've had here. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Second visit on another stop in CLT airport.  Had that salmon sandwich again (my main reason for going back to this restaurant).  It's still the bomb!  It's a smaller menu and not great for kids, but it's so comfy on those couches and fun to watch people walk by."}
{"text":"I have tried this place several times when I'm in the CLT airport. I think I may have had one of the best meals now, out of all I have tried here.   It's was the smoked salmon sandwich. I generally like to eat on the healthy side when traveling. This seemed like a close choice. Although it comes with creme fraiche, feta and herb cream cheese. First that is way too many cheeses on one sand which and after I ordered mine I done know how that will all even fit! I went with the creme only and it was perfect.   The bread was really good and you get a good portion of salmon. Yay brain food! It is a bit on the heavier side so I would recommend if your hungry."}
{"text":"Great place to grab food and wine when you have a layover! They have a great wine selection- I tried the Carolina favorites. I sat at the bar and the bartender was nice, however not as personable, the service was giving you what you ordered with nothing more nothing less. The menu has a tapas options which were $12+, open faced sandwiches $10+, and salads $10+. I tried the roasted chicken with avocado crema open faced sandwich-$11 and it was the best chicken I've tasted-melts in your mouth good!! Why go to other fast food places at the airport where they upcharge when you can go here for a better ambiance and less crowded. Btw, there is live piano outside the wine bar. Nice touch to set the mood."}
{"text":"Quiet, happy people, not airport food, and diverse wine variety."}
{"text":"This is essentially a much nicer version of Vino Volo and easily the best food in Charlotte airport.  - Ceviche (A) - exceptional  - Herbed Chicken Sandwich (A) - baffling how good this \"open sandwich\" was. Better than most I've had outside an airport"}
{"text":"One of the few classy places to eat in the airport terminal or any airport terminal for that matter, at least in regards modern air travel. Beaudevin has a relaxing atmosphere from the moment you walk up. Coupled with good food and good service it's a home run. This is how it should be for a someone leaving the comforts of home only to enter the loud, crowded and generally rude environment of air travel. I believe this is what the airline industry envisioned when it started its transcontinental service but apparently it never stuck.  Staff: The hostess was quick to greet and offered a number of seating options despite it being nearly full from others trying to escape the loud intercom and shoving crowds. I ended up taking the couches and made conversation with a group of lawyers. Yep, even the flock of Esq talking legalese was tolerable with wine and a comfy couch, lol.  Wine glass chandlers, combo wood and tile floors and soft tones on the walls set the decor while soft rock with a modern tone and cool jazz alternated from the sound system completing the ambiance, relaxing.  Food: I only had about 45 min and wanted to make the most of it so I decided on the Artesian Cheese Tray and despite it wasn't the best array of cheeses to complement the grouping of spanish reds (wines) I had already ordered I was quite pleased as it fit my palette perfectly.   Overall: After a day of hell jumping from one plane to another for book signing tour (Battle Ready, Memoir of a Navy SEAL Medic...in case anyone is interested) this place was like paradise while I awaited the last flight of the night to bring me home.  A must stop from now, in Charlotte, especially if I'm with my wife!  Take the time to stop at Beaudevin, you won't regret it. 5 Stars."}
{"text":"This place is incredible! It might seem expensive at first, but if you compare the prices to other establishments at this airport, you will see it's about the same. We ordered 2 different salads and a sandwich. All the food was delicious, beautiful, healthy and very unique. Compliments to the chef! And the staff was very friendly and helpful. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Beaudevin is an oasis in the middle of CLT, especially with all the construction that has been going on lately. It's very possible to zoom in and out of here on a short layover, which I really appreciate on days like today. They have an expansive wine selection and make great pairing recommendations. I'm a fan of the smoked paprika chicken salad sandwich, which has pecans, a very light mayo), and overall a nice texture and consistency that I don't often see with chicken salads. I had it with a wedge salad, which normally I'm not a fan of because of my general desire for tasteless iceberg lettuce to go extinct, BUT they even managed to make it flavorful and accompany it with a balance of tomatoes, peppers, and oil to make it enjoyable.   The strawberry peach Bellini is also quite nice. Note that the speciality cocktails run around $16, which isn't surprising given airport + wine bar status.   Super friendly service and a quiet respite from the main terminal. I pretty much make a beeline over here as soon as I get off the plane, every time!"}
{"text":"Wow! For a few minutes I completely forgot I was in the airport waiting on a connection. The atmosphere, service, food it was exceptional! Truly something special in an airport!"}
{"text":"Fact of life - Airport food sucks. Well, there are exceptions and this is one. Setting feels kinda upscale but the prices are modest and the food is a welcome surprise at an airport. The waitress is super friendly too."}
{"text":"I made sure to have about an hour or so to get to my next flight at Charlotte, but due to the flooding in the area, my plane was delayed for four hours D: When we touched ground, I found this nice little place and decided to get a couple drinks.  They have a fantastic wine selection, with a lot of local North Carolina wines that will be hard to find anywhere else. The prices can be a little steep,but for an airport, it's not all that bad. They also have a full bar, with a decent selection to make you most of the cocktails that you would want. I ordered an old fashioned the \"old fashioned\" way, not the modern interpretation or the 1950's style. Just sugar, angostura bitters, rye, with a lemon and orange peel. The bartender made kind of an inbetween, with a muddled orange slice. Although it wasn't what I ordered exactly, it still tasted very good.   I ordered a sidecar next, and the bartender didn't know how to make it. I gave her my recipe, but she forgot to shake it D: However, she quickly fixed it and made me a new drink.   Although they have a full bar, their knowledge of cocktails is a bit lacking. However, they make that up with a great knowledge of wine and awesome service. I got one of their malbec's and started talking about wine with them and it was really great to hear their knowledge about some of the local vineyards. I only wish that they carried some wines with some more weight and muscle behind them like a nice bottle of Australian Shiraz.   If you are unfortunate to have a sinfully long delay or worse, have your flight cancelled, you can w(h)ine about it with other like minded people at Beaudevin with some awesome drinks and even better service. If I'm ever stranded at Charlotte, at least I have a great place to hang out."}
{"text":"Very healthy clean eating place in the Charlotte airport wedge salad was different it had a lemon vinaigrette dressing my chicken BLT sandwich was delicious."}
{"text":"Was worried when I saw the menu seeing mostly sandwiches but stopped anyways. Tried the herb chicken sandwich and it was actually fairly substantial in size, though not as big on flavor. Don't get me wrong, it was good chicken and they included other vegetables. Not a wine afficianado so felt out of place but they had pretty good iced tea for a thirsty traveler.  We made the mistake of also ordering the cheese plate where even the small was decent sized. Service started slow but picked up after a while and made our plane on time."}
{"text":"5 stars because it's in an airport. The food was reasonably priced ($10 for a fresh salad). The lettuce was crisp, the dressing tasted freshly homemade. A very nice wine selection as well. Service was ok. I would recommend a polite request to quicken the pace should you have a tight connection. Overall, I'm very impressed."}
{"text":"Baby spinach salad was great. Added smoked salmon. Good wine list. Excellent for anywhere, tops for an airport"}
{"text":"I ate at Beaudevin on the way out of Charlotte airport (finally!). I think I might have made the wrong choice when ordering. I was between the artichoke fondue small plate and the chicken sandwich. I asked for the waitress' opinion, and she said the fondue... went with that. Well.... I wouldn't say what I got was fondue. What does the word fondue imply to you? To me, I picture hot bubbly cheese. This was a cold spinach artichoke dip. Hmmmm... not what I was expecting. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything special and it was totally overpriced beyond belief. The other food looked good, so I guess that was my mistake. Regardless, based on my experience I can't recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Because of the lack of options, I ended up back-tracking to this spot because it seemed like the only decent option.    I ended up ordering the scottish smoked-salmon sandwich, not sure I understand the difference between the sando and the appetizer. I happened to have a new waitress, so didn't get a great answer.  The sando did the job fine and probably was one of the better options in terms of restaurants in this airport.  I happened upon a slower server, but looking around some of the waitstaff was way on it, like they should be in an airport."}
{"text":"This is one of the two really good restaurants at the Charlotte airport. The other is a burger place. Yep, it's a wine bar and so that's a lot of their focus. But before 11:00 AM, they have a really decent breakfast that you shouldn't miss, as long as you have some time.  Comfortable seating area that's recessed from the atrium (which runs between Concourse B and Concourse C) so it's away from the noise and hubbub of the airport. Proper tablecloths and actual metal cutlery (yes, the knife has a rounded point) on a pretty glass plate.  I had the egg scramble, which came with a nice bunch of grapes and a mini-croissant Portion was great, the flavor was great. Cleaned my plate. The coffee had a nice fresh-brewed flavor to it, served in a decent sized cup.  Pleasant waitress (Nicole) took care of me and promptly.  No, I didn't have any wine but they did look to have a good selection."}
{"text":"Had a long layover and this was a nice treat to find. Was dreading eating the overpriced, terrible fast food airports usually have! We got the charcuterie plate, the Mediterranean flatbread, and the chicken sandwich. Everything was delicious and the Chenin blanc they had for the special this month was superb!"}
{"text":"As a heavy domestic US traveler, I can say that this place is AS GOOD as it gets in terms of airport dining experiences.  The service was excellent and friendly and the food was great."}
{"text":"The restaurant is really cute and a comfortable place to just relax and forget you're in a n airport for a bit. Stopped in for a quick bite before my flight and ordered the smoked salmon and artisan bagel with herbed cream cheese along with an order of fresh seasonal fruit. The bagel and salmon were as expected, nothing to write home about, but satisfying and met my expectations of smoked salmon and a bagel. I was kind of ticked off by the fruit bowl because it was 3/4 full of old grapes when the menu said it would be fresh assorted berries, and the few berries tasted like they had been hanging out way in the back of a fridge in need of a new baking soda box. On top of that, my bagel plate was served with a heaping cut of more grapes and like, if you told me the garnish is pretty much the same as the side that cost another $6-7, I would've just settled for the garnish."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! Just wondering if my connections in Charlotte will allow myself sometime to eat here, breakfast, lunch or dinner, great wine and great price! Charming decoration and perfect service. What else would you expect in a restaurant? Ah, food! Deliciousness in detail! My faves: croissant with omelet for the morning, ceviche and the little fondue for lunch and dinner. Awesome salads!"}
{"text":"I would eat here even if it wasn't in an airport.  Food was well above average for an airport restaurant, definitely a must when in Charlotte on a layover!"}
{"text":"Love having the opportunity to stop here when in the Charlotte airport.  The Green Apple Salad with manchego cheese, arugula, and marcona almonds is great.  Light and refreshing!  Tried the Cellar Selection, Justin Isosceles from Paso Robles.  Delicious!  I'm missing CA right now."}
{"text":"Probably one of the better dining options in the Charlotte airport.  Spinach Salad with Chicken. It was a good meal.  Varied selection of wine. I don't know enough to tell how the prices were in comparison to other places.   Service was a bit slow despite the fact that the restaurant wasn't very crowded."}
{"text":"What a delightful surprise in an airport! The food was delicious!! The atmosphere, located in the middle of the atrium was decidedly un-airportish; urban sophisticated, fresh, and calm.   I ordered the charcuterie salad- I thought the pickled green beans might be odd, but they were fantastic and worked with the rest of the salad perfectly. I also ordered the citrus crab cocktail which was an extremely large portion of crab meat and delicious!   Then I got the desert flight and OMG. No really, at one point I literally exclaimed \"oh my God!\" It was so good. What an unexpectedly fantastic meal!  Staff was perfect- friendly, efficient, and only around when you needed them.  I was able to charge my phone and pass a very pleasant 2 hour lay over. The only place I'd eat at this airport!"}
