{"text":"The restaurant was not full but the service was extremely slow. The only option for appetizers was two choices of salads. The \"Fresh\" vegetable salad was probably made a week ago and the \"Grilled\" salad was just OK. Main course was tasteless and uncooked. The lamb was barely chewable and the chicken was practically raw.  The experience was so terrible that we didn't stay for the desert. The restaurant is horrible. The service is slow, the food is disgusting, the place is dirty..."}
{"text":"Seriously avoid this restaurant. It's not even worth spending a Loonie (1$) at this place. Not only the food is horrible but also the service is poor, the glasses and dishes are dirty and on top of all there is no ambiance. Without the doubt, the worst experience we had in Montreal. My husband and I try almost every restaurant in town & this restaurant by far was the worst experienced we had in the last ten years! We started with \"delicious\" house wine which we haven't had a wine that bad even when we were in college. It was cheap kind and definitely not even a half a liter but he charged us 35$ for it!
For food, we started with salads. There are two salads, \"fresh\" & \"grilled\" vegetables in the menu so we decided to try both. It was awful. The portion wasn't even a spoonful but \"fresh\" vegetables were almost a week old & the \"grilled\" vegetables were very spicy, but nothing special. We stayed even though the service was too slow as we thought the food might be better. We took lamb and prunes tajine and chicken and lemon tajine. Again portions were too small, tasteless - no prunes in tajine, no spices, and not even cooked. Lamb and chicken pieces were raw - we couldn't cut the meat, leave along eat them. We left hungry and went to another place. I don't recall such a terrible experience in Montreal restaurants."}
{"text":"Le couscous n'est pas en grain fin, dommage. Si vous voulez un thé choisissez le sinon il ne vous donneras pas le the a la menthe classique"}
{"text":"Une déception! Leur couscous est insipide, et manque cruellement de saveurs, ce qui est dommage car la portion est généreuse.  L'ambiance est moyenne, la musique est bonne mais le décor manque de raffinement. Le service est rapide et malgré que le personnel semble faire tout pour être à l'écoute (ce qui ne m'a pas paru sincère personnellement ) l'ambiance est pesante et pas du tout chaleureuse. Pour moi les personnes qui ont ouvert ce restaurant n'ont clairement pas la passion de la restauration et cherchent juste à faire de l'argent! Dommage ..."}
{"text":"This place has a real exotic vibe, and the food is really home-y.  I am no African food expert, but I thought the food was done well and tasty. 

As Dan has already noted, the servings here are HUGE. I ordered the veggie couscous while my boyfriend ordered the chicken one, and neither one of us finished our meal. I enjoyed the veggies, and I liked the experience of pouring soup to my own couscous. 

My one issue with this place was the service. The server was nice and cute, but he was so busy that he rarely gave us any attention after taking our order. Also, the fact that they don't serve alcohol was a minus."}
{"text":"L'endroit est maintenant fermé. Il a été remplacé par une boutique de tatouage. Je vais regretter l'accueil extrêmement sympathique de l'endroit. 

This place is now closed. It has been replaced by a tattoo parlour."}
{"text":"They will start you off with some olives, bread, eggplant spread and a dipping sauce. Just letting you know. Also, if you want wine, you can BYOB or pick some up at the SAQ just a short walk away.

My friend and I got 2 couscous meals. Each of them comes in a large bowl with way too much couscous and topped with whatever meat you got. I had lamb and chicken and my friend had merguez so we were able to share a bit of each. 

I am a big eater and I couldn't finish all of the couscous in the bowl!"}
