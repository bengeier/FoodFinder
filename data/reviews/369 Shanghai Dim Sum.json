{"text":"well? honestly? i will never eat there again. It's not like I hate it? but everything just so so. and it's kind of pricy for what they made. not worth it."}
{"text":"Happy to see this place still standing after such a long time. We haven't been here for ages. But when we were around the area 2 days ago, we were surprised to see it's still here. Gotta see if how's their food after such a long time.   We ordered the Beef Noodle and sticky rice?????. They're both very up to standard. The beef was tender, the soup was tasty and the noodle had good texture. The sticky rice was very soft. The ??? (fried dough) inside was a little too soggy to my liking, but still better than those re-fried, hard ones in some other places.   The place wasn't busy when we were there. Service was okay.   Will come back again."}
{"text":"Dumplings and soup filled pork dumplings were both just \"okay\" as they lacked flavouring in them. Everything else was decent but the portions were quite large so you don't really get the chance to try a lot of different things.  The restaurant was very packed when I went but service was surprisingly efficient and friendly. Overall, I'd probably not go back as I've had a better experience at Asian Legend."}
{"text":"?????????????????????????????????????????????? VISA ??????????????????????????????????????????????? VISA ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? VISA ? logo???????????????????"}
{"text":"I used to be a regular customer here, and am extremely sad to say I will NEVER be coming here again. I've heard this place used to be amazing but had a change of owner or something and things have gone downhill ever since. Whoever this owner is, literally everything I have heard about them indicates to me that they're a colossal jerk, and are running this restaurant into the ground. Such a shame.  We seemed to be the only white people who ever came. I always liked the food, but have found the service to be extremely poor. The staff speak almost no English, the service is very slow, and we felt they were very aloof and unfriendly. When we were sitting down eating, they would constantly be watching us like circus freaks and it was very VERY uncomfortable. We were very loyal patrons, we came once a week and sometimes a dish would not always be quite right and we would politely ask for it to be corrected. Nobody is perfect but they would always make such a big fuss and get so upset with us over it.  We were very fond of the hot sauce they had in little jars at all the tables, and the last straw came when they accused us of taking too much hot sauce and refused to give us a refill, stating that the owner has stipulated that there's a limit of one per table and no refills, which is confusing because they gave us refills in the past and it was never EVER a problem before. We offered to pay for extra sauce, but they absolutely refused, stating they're not allowed to sell it. Their demeanor was very tactless and nasty, it was very VERY hurtful and upsetting that they would suddenly do that to us.  Obviously our very loyal patronage and very VERY generous tips meant absolutely nothing to them, if they're going to give us a hard time over hot sauce of all things. We won't be dining here ever again."}
{"text":"We came here after a battle in a friendly golf competition between some friends. We're use to eating at places that offer dumplings and steam soup buns, so this is something we wanted to try.  We ordered 3x the steam soup buns. Ordered 2x friend pop stickers. One snow peas veggie. One shrimp egg fried rice. One shanghai noodles. And a few cold milk tea.  The steam soup bun, the bun skin texture was kind of thick for me and it would break often, so I'd lose some soup. The meat texture was good and tasty.  The fried pop sticker was quite enjoyable. The snow pea is standard. The shrimp egg rice is standard. The noodle is standard.  The cold milk tea surprisingly is tasty. All for the price of $19pp. I'm not sure if I'd come back here in the future, bc there are other places that are just about the same standard if not better, but if I am around the area and crave for steam soup bun, I'd prob come by again."}
{"text":"Soo was it just me.. but the WHOLE menu was in Chinese and since i cannot read Chinese my dad had to order for us. So that definitely takes away a star.  The food here was pretty good, we had the shanghai fried noodles, soup dumplings, and some other noodle in soup thing. Another thing that docked off a star was.. the place didn't seem ready for customers yet. It was 2pm on a Monday and our tables did not have vinegar on them yet so we had to ask for it when our soup dumplings came (when we were leaving we saw one of the waiters filling up the jars).   I would come back because the food was good, hopefully they'll be ready for me next time! haha"}
{"text":"3.5 stars   Got takeout at this location before the dinner rush hour so they were able to take my order right away. I ordered steamed soup dumplings, steam dumplings with chives and pork and pan fried dumplings. 3 orders came to around $25 and wait was about 10 minutes which was not bad. I would recommend both the steam soup dumplings and pan fried dumplings as it was very juicy and tasty. The steamed dumplings were pretty good but did lack a bit of flavour compared to the other two. In comparison to the other dumpling restaurants, this was a bit more expensive and the quality was about the same as others."}
{"text":"Good place for Shanghai style dim sum.  Pan fried dumplings, steamed pork dumplings, and fried rice cakes with pickled cabbage and shredded pork are the best.  Much better quality than Asian Legend."}
{"text":"I've known this place since 2010. The xiao long bao are one of the best I have ever tried, beaten only by shanghai dim sum. The fried dumplings were great, the noodle soup was average, but the sticky rice was better than all the rest. The rice was chewy and soft, the meat was, well, meaty and the inside was nice and crunchy. We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I've never bothered to try this place but when Tofu Village closed down, we needed to eat so we decided to try this place.  Food seemed pretty bland, seemed to be missing flavor... but ya i agree.. the staff are nice."}
{"text":"I loved the food. That was the first time I tried Shanghai style dim sum and I was not disappointed. Everything was very tasty and felt like homemade. Also the service was pleasant and smiling what very unusual in Chinese restaurant. I will come again."}
{"text":"Cost: reasonable Quality: good - 80% Decor: average - 75% a bit tight because they squeeze a lot of people in Staff: average service - 75% Value: good - 80%  Keeper? Yes we go there once a month or so."}
{"text":"Second time at this place.  First time wasn't very memorable aside than the fact that it is overpriced. Decided to try it again as it's close to home.  However service this time was bad.  Restaurant was half full yet food took over 20 mins to come.  (This is considered long for a Chinese restaurant!). Even took long for us to get our change back after we paided for our bill.  Older waitress was also rude and not friendly.  Tables were not clean, had to get out baby wipes to clean it myself. I don't expect much from Chinese restaurants but with higher prices I would figure better service and cleanliness.  Prices are high but food that is mediocre with poor service.  Many other places to try that have better food at a better price, like northern dumpling house or dumpling king."}
{"text":"There is one reason to go to Shanghai Dim Sum: the xiao long bao aka soup-filled dumplings. The other dishes here range from mediocre to good, but the xiao long bao are consistently excellent.  The fried pork dumplings are pretty good, too, but it's the xiao long bao that make the drive to Markham worth it."}
{"text":"Definitely better than Din Tai Fung. Even the steamed veggie dumplings are delicious. Good service, very clean."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in a busy plaza near Kennedy & Hwy 7, and it's a trek for me to get up here so but when I have a craving for xiaolongbao this is where I come.   The entire menu is in Chinese, which is a bit of a hindrance to me, but I'm always here with people that can translate for me. Their regular xiaolongbao dumplings are excellent - meaty, juicy and sturdy enough to not fall apart when you pick them up with chopsticks. The crab meat one was disgusting  - fishy and tasted of artificial crab flavour.   The panfried dumplings are huge and greasy, but very tasty. The Shanghai fried noodle is usually very good, but tonight it was lacking a certain je ne sai quois - it wasn't really  hot when it was brought to the table and it was bland and boring. It's usually much better.   Wait staff are friendly and service is quick and attentive. Cash and  debit only, no credit cards. Open 7 days a week 11am-11pm."}
{"text":"We were 5 poeple, all montrealers, came to this place because of me. The menu is huge, but we selected the basic traditional shanghai dishes:  pan fried pork dumplings ?????, crispy short ribs on steam rice mixed with minced bok choy ??????, braised beef soft tendon with spicy dressing ??????siu lung bao (???), and sticky rice roll (??). All dishes exceeded my expectation, hot and fresh and very well presented."}
{"text":"Went to this place last week on a weeknight around 630pm.  Was not that busy.  Food was outstanding.  The soup-dumplings were delicious, as were a number of other dishes that we tried.  Communication in English was a bit of a challenge, but overall it was a great meal and a great experience."}
{"text":"I don't know why I bother trying dishes I already love from Asian Legend...but sometimes one gets curious and wants to go off the beaten path.  Well...once again, this restaurant proved to me how much I love Asian Legend.  The food is not terrible, and if I lived closer, and all the Asian Legends were closed, I might drop by...BUT...it's just so much better at AL.  HIGHLIGHTS: The fried dumplings weren't bad.  I really liked the crispy exteriors.  Seemed like all the tables around me also ordered this popular dish.  The onion pancake wasn't bad either.  LOWLIGHTS: Overall, the biggest problem with this place is the lower quality of meat that is served.  So the dumplings that I had, the beef in the beef noodle soup, were all disappointing.  I left the restaurant with a heavy stomach from all the oil in their dumpling fillings...  I will probably never go back again...  The service was also typically Chinese...i.e. \"we're doing you a favour\" kind of attitude.  But that's expected."}
{"text":"I'm reading the reviews here and I'm just surprised there are any remotely positive reviews about this place. This restaurant has been around for years and I've visited consistently about once a year and I must say though their quality has declined steadily over the last 5 years or so, this is definitely the last time I will pay a visit.   I remember when this place actually used to be decent and there was a wait for tables. I ordered pretty standard items - the steamed dumplings (xiao lung bao), deep fried pork noodles, and fried dumplings. Honestly the meat tastes like it's rotten and it's falling apart in the dumpling. The soup in the dumpling is mediocre at best and the fried pork looks and tastes worse than ones I can get from a food court."}
{"text":"The sweet ribs with bokchoy were pretty good. Don't get the mini juicy dumplings because they're not juicy at all, just get the regular sized ones (which weren't all that juicier either, I've had better ones). They're kinda slow."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm craving soup dumplings uptown, I immediately think of Ding Tai Fung at First Markham Place. However, this weekend my dad and I decided to try something new and we visited 369 Shanghai Dim Sum at Peachtree Plaza for the first time!  We managed to get seated right away, although the restaurant was nearing full capacity for lunch. Service was friendly and the menu was quite expansive. Between the two of us, we shared the xiao long bao (soup dumplings), wo tip (fried dumplings), and the glass noodle soup with fried tofu. While I still prefer the soup dumplings at Ding Tai Fung, their fried dumplings were amazing - just the right amount of crispiness on the outside and perfectly tasty and soupy on the inside. The glass noodle soup was pretty good too.  Overall, a great place for Shanghai food! Can't wait to come back and try some of the other things on their menu."}
{"text":"Must say I like this place. I always get the same thing - Shanghai noodles, onion pancake, and various dumplings."}
{"text":"I'm Shanghainese and my husband is Cantonese. I didn't really find the food authentic. It was quite average for me. He found it quite tasty though. For the two of us we ordered 3 items: 1 soup dumpling, 1 smoked pork bamboo soup, and 1 zhejiang ribs. It came to be about $40. I did enjoy the soup. But I don't think I've ever not enjoyed this particular dish as it is one of my favorites. I think the soup dumplings are average. I won't recommend the zhejiang ribs as the meat was undercooked and the sauce is too sweet and not as flavorful as it should be. As for the atmosphere, the place looks quite nice. However, I think they were trying to reserve the 4 ppl tables so we were shafted to a small table right next to the cashier and the tea serving station. It was 9 pm and the traffic was low. I think they should've given us better seats. Basically all the ladies were like standing around us talking.  I won't be going back there any time soon."}
{"text":"Been going to 369 for on an off over the years.  They are a very solid restaurant for good xiao long bao and the pan fried dumplings. I also really like their spicy beef tendons, come cut in cubes.   I've also always get the marinated beef rice which comes with a soup. Or the beef brisket noodles.  369 has been around for a long time, I think over the years better restaurants that serve the same type of food have opened, at Times Square for example. However this place is still very good and solid in the Kennedy and hwy 7 area."}
{"text":"I love this place! Honestly, in my personal opinion, one of the best Shanghai restaurants in Markham area!  Bamboo shoots are a great appetizer that gets your appetite going with a great taste and texture!  Always gotta order the Xiao Long Bao, as the skin is always thin and soup is delicate and tasty!  My personal favorite are the Shanghai Noodles! Best part is that it isn't swimming in oil on the plate!  (Did go today, and had a bit of a let down in terms of food: sticky rice barely had anything in it and shanghai noodles didn't have any pork or veggies. Asked to get a new plate and they just threw some pork/veggies on top. Didn't taste all that great today, but this is not the norm. First time this has ever happened to me. I'm not sure if there has been a change in chef/owners, but I haven't been in quite some time, so unsure of any changes...)  This review is based on my overall experiences in my many visits, not just my 1 bad experience."}
{"text":"I have been here since I immigrated from Shanghai. I really miss my mom's cooking and nothing comes close to this restaurant for authenticity. The service is awesome and the ladies can provide a warm home atmosphere in the restaurant. This is a must go in Markham."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite Shanghainese restaurants in N. America.  I love the xiao long bao and cold plates here.  Every time I go home to Toronto, this place is a must visit."}
{"text":"Ambiance/decor-3 Service-3 Food-3 Strikeouts-0/3  It's been 5-6 years since I last came here and nothing has changed. The place looked exactly the same, which is a good thing. It means they keep things clean and they do have a regular customer base. It also means they have good service and polite!  The food is definitely not spectacular, but not bad at any sense. This place has the variety of the typical shanghai food. From the beef brisket noodle soup to the xiao long bao. It also has the cold dishes, which are harder to find since it's not as popular as the hot dishes. They could honestly work on their beef and onion pancake wrap and add more beef and a ton of more green onions, but right now Asian legend trumps them. The good part is they aren't too expensive, making it affordable than the bigger chain restaurants."}
{"text":"Went there with my family. One of the dishes we ordered was deep fried dough sticks. The fryer wasn't hot enough when the dough was put in, so the dough sticks soaked up a lot of grease to a point that was was not edible. It literally was dripping in oil. I spoke to the server, and she shrugged at me and brought me some paper towels they use for drying their on, to soak up the oil. There isn't enough paper towels to make this simple dish edible. I then showed it to the owner, she nodded at me and took the food back into the kitchen and that was that. Didn't replace it or say anything. That's just too bad. I'll never go back again."}
{"text":"Have not been for a while, and went the other week. Dumplings are fine but stay away from the hot and sour soup. Nobody makes decent hot and sour soup anymore."}
{"text":"Not bad. First time coming here, though I live only 5 min down the street. I usually go to Ding Tai Fong at First Markham for this kind of stuff but this time I wanted to try this place. It's not bad but I have tried better. The Siu Long Bao seemed to get stuck together so when you lift it up with your chopstick, you end up poking a hole in your dumpling and waste all the tasty juices that is suppose to be eaten with the dumpling.    I give this place a 4 star because their service was extremely friendly and they do their best to make you as a customer feel welcome and wanted. They are also very polite and attentive and appreciate your business.  There's something about this place that can make it great ... but im not too sure what it is. It has potential .. because the service was excellent. Maybe it is just the food dishes can improve a little bit more."}
{"text":"Very authentic Chinese food. Price is a little higher than usual but everything here is yummy and hits the spot. Love their pot fried dumplings, the siu long bao and pan fried buns. Everything we got here was delicious and service was friendly."}
{"text":"If you're in the area craving delicious Shanghai-nese xiao long bao and don't want to bother flying to China and waiting in the long lines at Cheng Huang Miao, check this place out! The xiao long bao here are delightful with a thin delicate skin filled with lots of delicious soup and meat! Just like they do it back home :)   I came here with my parents and we got the liang ban gan si and the xun yu as the cold dishes, hot and sour soup, xiao long bao, crab xiao long bao, pot stickers, wonton soup, sao mai, and shrimp dumplings.   I would definately get the liang ban si, xiao long bao, and wonton soup again. The xun yu on the other hand was a bit of a disappointment as you could tell the fish was far from being fresh. The crab xiao long bao were also disappointing as they were more expensive yet not as tasty as the original. The pot stickers, shrimp dumplings and sao mai were also a bit plain. Finally, I'm not a huge fan of hot and sour soup in general so I can't properly judge that.   All in all, if I'm ever back in Toronto again, I'll definately stop by for some xiao long bao and yummy memories of Shanghai :D"}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends for lunch on a Sunday. At first we were going to another restaurant in this mall, however due to lack of space we decided to switch to another venue... So we are here. Opened the door, it was just before noon and there were a few tables. The owner sat us down quickly and we began deciding what we are gonna eat.   Let's start off w/ the venue: This place has been here for more than a decade. I remembered I came here once. But with the rise of other Shang-hainese restaurants closer to where I live, I neglected this place. Back to the venue, decor can be a bit dated? And there's this smell of bleach that makes it awkward.   Onto the food, we ordered a Taiwanese style stir fried rice noodle, a Zhejiang style braised pork ribs with dark vinegar and a fried beef tenderloin strips with honey, garlic and chilly sauce. The Taiwanese stir fried rice noodle came out piping hot and smelled great. It tasted alright too. But... it was quite oily. The ribs tasted really good, I love the dark vinegar... but again to oily. The fried beef tenderloin strips dish was very fresh, but somehow my friends and I thought there were too much batter and not enough meat. At the end, we let this dish sat too long and the honey hardened so it was hard to finish off the last few pieces. This was the only dish that didn't have a layer of oil at the bottom of the plate.   The staff seemed alright, they looked after us adequately. So no comments there. However, wish they have better skill when it comes to cooking to reduce the oil. Overall experience is a 3/5 for sure."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Shanghainese food and this place is a bit of a mixed bag, some dishes they do very well and others not so much.   I recently came here on a Saturday night and the restaurant was bustling. We were seated promptly and our order was taken in a timely fashion. The star of the food was definitely the Xiao Long Bao (soup dumplings) these were clearly made fresh; the filling was so juicy, the soup delectable and the dough nicely cooked. This may have been the best dumpling filling I have ever had which is saying a lot cause I do have a bit of a dumpling addiction. Another dish I really enjoyed was the shanghai noodles which were cooked perfectly and contained a healthy portion of meat, shrimp and veggies, this dish is a winner.   On the other hand there were some dishes that were just OK. A cold dish consisting of beef tendon and garlic was pretty good, it was a bit gelatinous but the raw garlic gave it a good punch of flavour. The fried dumplings I was not a big fan of, they were too doughy, not crispy enough and greasy. Lastly we ordered a fried fish dish that was covered in a sweet and garlicky sauce, the fish was cooked nicely but there was too much sauce for my liking; it certainly masked the natural flavour of the fish. We did order some dessert as well which was a steamed dumpling with what I believe was egg yolk inside, for a Chinese dessert this was a hit, I enjoyed it.   The service here was pretty friendly and our food was brought out hot and fresh. The restaurant itself is pretty bright and clean, kind of small and seems to get busy at peak hours. Overall if you are looking for some good Shanghainese in Markham this is certainly a good option.   *3.69 stars ;-)"}
{"text":"I haven't been here over a year and when I walk in it was empty. This place usually has lot of people. I order white reddish cake it was ok. The hot and sour noodle was bad. Too much bamboo shoot and the soup turn watery very quickly. I think they might of change owner."}
{"text":"Not bad, I loved going here as a kid and actually coming every weekend for about two years. This place has been around for about a decade. I always love their xiao long bao and rice wrapped around a fried fritter. Their xiao long bao are made very nicely with a hole at the top, ready for you to suck out the soup, so you don't have to bite it, but the soup has a slight scent of pork smell, which not everyone will enjoy. I wouldn't say it's the cheapest place for shaghai food, nor are the dishes extremley large, but I guess if you want something new, you could try it out"}
{"text":"This used to be my fav shanghai restaurant, as it was clean, not too crowded and food was consistently delicious. Not it has been going downhill the last couple of years, especially the last year.   They forget orders often. Some food is not prepared fresh. Seems like it's from frozen or something.   Scallion/ green onion pancakes were bitter.  Got diarrhea from noodle take out. It was the only thing I ate all night."}
{"text":"It's a really nice place for some shanghai food, shao lun bao. Food arrives very fast and tastes good, located at a very busy plaza, parking might be hard during rush hours. I would recommend this place for everyone"}
{"text":"This restaurant is the go-to spot for my family whenever we are craving Shanghai food! You could tell this place is pretty awesome because there's always a line in the Linh rush!  We love the shaolong bao (???) here and recently, we found that they introduced a wasabi twist to it. Basically, it is the usual filling with added wasabi inside--such a unique combination. I would encourage when you eat this wasabi shaolong bao to make sure you've got a tissue or a napkin handy because your sinuses, whether you have any or not, is going to clear up!! If you haven't had it before, you've got to try it!!   All of their Shanghai dishes are made with such care. I was so hungry that I forgot to take a couple photos of the dishes, haha!   We ordered a Chinese Ham fried rice that was super tasty, the flavour of the salty fish infused in the ham is incomparable. We also had stir-fry eggplant, which had just the perfect texture--I hate when eggplant is overcooked and becomes super lumpy but not here, it was soft but still firm. Their veggie dumpling was delicious; I love how there's also tofu in the filling, most places just have veggie and vermicelli. As well, their pan fried dumpling is super juicy--highly recommend!   Dessert... where do I start to describe how AWESOME it is!! We had glutinous sesame ball (????) dessert; a beautiful balance of chewiness with the sesame paste. We also got this traditional Shanghainese soup dessert, I don't remember the name of it but it was interestingly delicious too with rice, goji berries, rice cake, and rice in it. But, I must say, their best dessert is the red bean pancake. I am absolutely addicted to it but you've got to eat it hot!! That flaky exterior along with the sweet red bean, that's not too sweet, I am just drooling trying to describe it in writing. A must-order!  Service and staff are always super friendly and attentive. They made sure our tea was refilled and our table was cleared before our dessert came out!!  Overall, would I come back? Oh HECK YES!!!"}
{"text":"Food was really nothing too special, the xiao long bao was decent at best, some of the skins started ripping, and their dumplings were mediocre, with really thick skins, and not that much juice inside. The meat inside is ok, at best, but with quite a bit of fat.  The service was horrible, essentially non-existent.  We understand that at a Shanghai restaurant in Markham/Toronto, the tea really doesn't count for anything, but the fact that it took such a long time to flag down a waitress to get anything - a bowl, tissues, tea refill, our bill, was honestly ridiculous, especially for such a tiny restaurant.  The tables are also tiny, and our party of 3 was crammed into a tiny table, meant for maybe 1 or 2.  It's usually better to come at the beginning of eating times, ie. the beginning of lunch or dinner, as the place is tiny, and can filled up pretty quickly."}
{"text":"So we came as a group here to eat dinner, I honestly should stop writing reviews for Shanghainese restaurants.... I'm biased... seriously.... my dad cooks it and I always compare to what he makes....  So It's hard to go by my scale....we ordered alot of dim sum.....Becuz I personally believe this is the most important items while eating at a shanghainese restaurant...   And it was a disappointment...dumplings, shanghainese noodles and the rest of it - epic fail...   Noodles were sooo oily felt like I was spoonfeeding on oil... dumplings were like what I buy from supermarket and make it at home follow the instructions... blah...   When I asked for the black vinegar, they were impolite and rude...felt like I was being asked to leave...   Prices were average. Not cheap not expensive. But the food seriously was unimpressive...   Another reason for me to always consider ding tai fung and Asian legend when I eat Shanghainese food.   This was my first and last experience here. Goodbye"}
{"text":"Looking for the same 5 spices in everything you eat? Well, I have good news. If found the perfect place for you.    The \"Dim Sum\" portions are meal sized portions with meal sized prices.  If there are only 2 of you it is hard to get any variety here since 2 items is all you will be able to eat.  Or, maybe this place is telling me that I need more friends.    With all of the variety in the area my advice is to just skip this place."}
{"text":"DING DING DING!  We have a new winner for the best soup filled dumplings in GTA.  I actually ordered the soup filled dumplings again for \"dessert\" cause they were that good.  Seriously, if you only order one thing here order the soup filled dumplings.  I came in here looking for soup filled dumplings, that's pretty much it.  I decided to give some of the other things a try, so we also ordered the drunken chicken, the pork and chive dumplings, chunky chill beef noodles and steamed pork buns.  The drunken chicken came first and I have to tell you that I wish they actually spent some time making this.  It seemed like they just poured alcohol on the chicken afterwards cause it tasted bitter afterwards because of the alcohol (yuk).  The chunky beef noodles were pretty neat cause they used handmade noodles, but the broth was really bland and the beef was not at all tender.  Too bad.  As for the pork and chive dumplings, they were alright.  The dough on them was really silky, but I found that they put way too much chive in there to my liking.  I don't think there was much pork in there at all.  As for the pork buns, they were about average.  Now, what makes their soup dumplings so good?  First of all, the dough is really thin, but not so thin that it falls apart when you pick them up.  Second, the pork filling is probably the smoothest, tenderest filling I've ever had.  They pretty much melt in your mouth.  Third, there is no third, it's awesome just order it.  In my opinion, I think this place is really only good for their dim sum or \"appetizer\" dishes.  Every one of our entrees kinda sucked.  I'd love to give this place more stars but I can't justify it on one dish.  But then again, it's an amazing dish.  You already know what you're going to order when you come here.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years! I remember when the door wasn't glass and everyone had to cram in the tiny space to wait for tables. :) I think I might be biased but I enjoy the usual foods here. Though the sui long bao seems to have shrunk in size... And some of the foods have gotten a little bland, but some new items are pretty good... Oh and the service is always fast. ;)   I like the picked veggies with the rice cakes. No clue what it was called. Chow leen go, for those who speak Chinese. :) and the noodles in their beef noodles are nice and chewy."}
{"text":"Dim sum here is great. The pork dumplings and 'drunk' chicken tastes delicious. Shanghai stir-fry noodles were too oily for my liking. Hot and sour soup is decent, if you enjoy spicy food.   Ordering is pretty straight forward. You tick off what you want, however if you want another menu, you will have to ask.   There's a mall nearby if you need to run and do errands after. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good despite being in a very isolated location. It is a bit more expensive than normal dim sum, but it sure shows in the quality.   We ordered a lot of dishes when we went here such as the eggplant in chili sauce, radish cakes, noodle soup with beef, etc. Those were among my favourite.  I would say if you are a fan of dim sum give this a try."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch this past Saturday and was looking forward to trying their soup dumplings. We got two orders of soup dumplings, one order of pork and shrimp dumplings, Chinese broccoli, boiled noodle with spicy peanut sauce, and sizzling beef tenderloin.   The soup dumplings were small, but they tasted pretty good. We were hoping that the skin of the dumplings would be thinner and that there would be more juices inside, but unfortunately we didn't get that. The pork and shrimp dumplings were also good and tasted great with the Chinese broccoli side we ordered. It was our first time trying the boiled noodle with spicy peanut sauce and we thought it tasted interesting, but good. The broth had a milky consistency with peanut flavour and the noodles absorbed the flavours of the broth. The beef tenderloin came out very hot and sizzling on the stone plate. This was our favourite dish because the meat was very tender and the pepper sauce on the beef added a nice spicy kick.  Overall, everything we ordered came out fresh and tasted good, and we also experienced great service from the servers. I don't think we'll be coming back for their soup dumplings, but definitely for their sizzling beef tenderloin!"}
{"text":"Go to Asian legend.  Ordered the salty hot soy milk, glutinous rice roll, and some dumplings.  The salty soy milk was not made very well, had no vinegar, they just dumped a bunch of hot oil in it.  The rice roll is not half as tasty as Asian legends, and dumplings were average at best.  Very standard shanghai dim sumbmade with below average quality at a premium price point.  No thank you."}
{"text":"This place is a pretty good Dim Sum place, but not the best. The food is great and a wide selection. Friendly staff, clean environment. I had the cashew shrimp.... yum. The wonton noodle soup was awesome, the hot and sour was awesome.   A few things I didn't like:   1.  The dumplings were under seasoned, bland.  2.  The portions were too large to be dim sum, be careful when you order. Each of the dishes you order would be dim sum sized for 4 people.  3. Parking is a nightmare.   I would go back for sure and order differently now that I know about the place."}
{"text":"I've given this place so many chances, and I have to say that I will not be coming back.  First of all, only a sliver of the food on the menu is good here. Out of the 100 or so things on the menu, I've only found 3 - the shanghai pork dumplings, the dandan noodles, and the pork potstickers - to be good (and they weren't even consistently good). That's 3%. Everything else I've tried here, including the main dishes, the dessert, appetizers, have been really lacking. That, plus like others have said, overpriced.  Then, the service is sorely disappointing. This one time was particularly astounding. We ordered a dish, which they forgot to enter into the system. After 30 minutes, we ask where it is. A server goes to check, comes back out and says they forgot to enter it in, and asks us, \"would you like the check?\" We say no, we want it, bring it.  Another 20 minutes go by. Nothing. We ask again. The same server comes back and says, \"Oh I thought you said no you don't want it.\" That makes absolutely NO sense. First of all, we said we wanted it. Next, according to the logic of his own question, if you misheard, then you should have brought us the check. We say, \"yes, we did want it.\" He goes away.  At this point, an hour has gone by. We see the owner and ask what the heck is going on. The original server drops by again and defends his stupidity of hearing that we said \"no\" a second time. You must be freaking kidding me. All the while, no apology, no no comping, no nothing. They just keep on trying to defend themselves by saying what they heard and making it sound like it's our fault.  These people don't know how to make good food and don't know how to run a business. Avoid."}
{"text":"Very tasty xiao lung bao. I think everything tastes similar to Ding Tai Fung, except I prefer Ding Tai Fung's stir fry shanghai noodles more.   Only negative thing is the parking in this plaza is always full."}
{"text":"Quality varies. On a non busy day its good, just don't go on weekends or when you know its busy. The food will taste totally different when they are busy."}
{"text":"I am giving this a 4 star only because of the quality it was when I went. Although I have noticed a decline in quality, especially in the beef noodles. I went in a weekday around lunch and it was rather empty"}
{"text":"I really was not expecting much from this place as it was a last minute decision without much research prior. One of the few times I did not get to read Jennifer K's review first before deciding. We ordered a lot of different things to try and I must say I was happy with all the dishes.  Beef noodle soup $8.25 - flavour of soup was good, portion of meat was generous, and noodles were cooked perfectly with great chew to them. Only complaint was that the meat was a bit on the tough side but still soft enough to enjoy.   Pork bun or I like to call them pork dumplings $5.95 (xiao long bao) - comes with 6 dumplings. Great flavours. Nice and soupy on the inside.  Noodles with spicy and peanut sauce $6.75 - looked like molten lava at first glance but it really was not that spicy. It had great flavours and the noodles were cooked to perfection once again.  Pork with preserved greens and rice $7.50 - pork was soft and tender and they got the flavours spot on with the preserved greens. I wish I didn't have to share this dish it was so good.  We got some snow pea leaves for some vegetables and as I write this review I just realized how much they charged us for it. $13.95 (HOLY F%#& SAKE's) I know these greens are normally on the pricier side and they are not in season now but WOW. They really bent us over on this one. This dish was really, really small too. This is what happens when you order and don't pay attention to the price. Anyway, another lesson learned. They did taste pretty good at least.  Finally, for dessert we got the sweet black sesame bun/dumpling $5.25 (xiao long bao) - taking a line for Guy Fieri, \"Shut the front door\"! Where have these been all my life. Its basically the same outer casing as the (xiao long bao) but filled with a sweet black sesame paste. It was not liquidy or watery on the inside but more of a moist paste which was sweet. Oh man. I love these things. Comes with only 6. If I knew they were this good I would have ordered one set for myself alone.   Overall, I was very happy with the outcome of this place. Service was also fast and friendly."}
{"text":"My husband used to go to this restaurant from time to time.    This evening we went back.    OH MY GOD!!  The quality of the food was so bad.   We ordered wontons/Bak Choy/and Chicken in soup.  The wontons were the WORST!!!   These wontons were one of the LOWEST quality I have ever tasted in Toronto.  So much MSG too!!  The prices went up significantly and the quality of the food went DOWN significantly.   Never again!   This restaurant is BLACK LISTED.   From now on, we will never go to this restaurant ever again."}
{"text":"Ok so honestly I was looking for a traditional dim sum place and was disappointed when I found out it only served Northern Chinese dim sum. Which means no ha gao, siu mai, bbq pork buns, and all that stuff. But then I asked the server for some recommendations and she picked some pan fried dumplings, more steamed dumplings, shanghai noodle soup, and a bunch of other doughy items. Everything was so yummy! Glad to have found this place"}
{"text":"The  xiao long bao served here is AMAZING. Love the freshness and quality of the soup dumplings. However, the beef brisket noodles were just okay - nothing special. The service is pretty average. It is a spacious restaurant, which allows you to grab a bite with a few friends or family. I'd recommend this place if you're having a dumpling craving!"}
{"text":"first, this place is not a dim sum place. this is just a regular taiwanese restaurant. not sure why they named it dim sum. lol the food were good. we had tons of food that we ordered and the quality of the food were consistance.  again, this place is Taiwanese food. so don't order anything other than taiwanese food, if you want other food, then go to regular chinese restaurant. :) taiwanese noodle is the typical food. (beef noodle soup, or try the spicy peanut noodle) if you don't want to explore, try pork chop with rice."}
{"text":"First off the customer service is terrible the waiter is very disrespectful that the owner had to talk to us to apologize we asked the waiter if the dish was pork shrimp with lobster sauce and he said no later on he said the dish had pork and we said we didn't want it and he was telling us we still had to pay for it then the owner stepped in and told us he will make a dish for us with no pork we really appreciated that the dish was tasty but just for that poor customer service i will never com back again they should fire that waiter"}
{"text":"They always increase the price of this place and decrease the portions every single time!! Ordered the usual Shanghai Dimsum: XLB, sticky rice, hot & sour soup, Shanghai fried noodles and pan-fried dumplings. I find that the Shanghai fried noodles and pan-fried dumplings were super oily but other than that, the taste was fine. My only issue with this place is that it is overpriced. There are way better options in Markham/Richmond Hill for Shanghai Dimsum."}
{"text":"Still the best Shanghai dim sum I have found in the GTA. (IMO, better than Ding Tai Fung and for sure better than Asian Legend). I go here often with my family and we tend to order the same things: steamed pork dumplings (siu loong bau -- the best!!), green onion pie (choong yau bang), shanghai noodles in soup with spicy vegetables, fried tofu and fried pork dumplings. For dessert, the sesame ball things in soup (forgot the name) are great."}
{"text":"A hidden gem at the Peachtree Plaza ! I love Shanghai food and over the years, 369 has been quite consistent with their food quality and prices. I love their pork pot stickers and the chives and pork steamed dumplings. For those that like jellyfish, their appetizer for jellyfish is good and refreshing. Overall, if you are looking for some authentic Shanghai food and good service, definitely try this place out."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, but I don't come here often.  This place has been around for years and is definitely worth trying.  The Shanghai Streamed Pork Buns were good! The wrapper is not as thin as Asian Legend. The flavour of the juices is also really good.   The Soy Minced Pork with Rice was also really good.  Very saucy compared to other places and sauce is usually good thing for flavour. I found the sauce to a bit too salty, but I think it's because I only ate half the rice.  Giving this place 4 stars because the pork buns (my reason for Shanghai food) are consistent and authentic.  Nice place for a casual family dinner!  Service was great, Micheal and he waitresses were very attentive. Hope this restaurant's tradition doesn't get lost."}
{"text":"Consistent.  Always good.  This is not food that is thrown together in a hurry.  1.  My favorite LONG GREEN BEANS in TONS of garlic (soy sauce).  Dry.  Exquisite.  Always have that when I go here; 2.  Taofu-pi (or dried taofu) which had a smoked-tea/five-spice flavor in a hoisin-like dipping sauce.  Very refined flavor.  Very unique and definitely old-school.  Yum; 3.  Beef and lanzhou-style noodles in a spicy broth with green vegetable (bok choi).  VERY nice except the meat was a bit too fatty for our taste.  But otherwise, very good; 4.  Pork and leek dumplings - skin was a bit thick and compared to everything else, this particular dish did not stand out. 5.  Excellent, excellent service.  This place is stellar when it comes to good table side service and the staff in this restaurant are always professional, polite and friendly; 6.  Very comfortable restaurant - seats/tables are comfortable, and made for lingering - i.e. not uncomfortable so you can run out quickly.  Old-school Shanghai-style dim-sum place.  Never disappoints."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese restaurant I have eaten at in North America in its price range (and it also beats most places that are more expensive).  Their xiao long bao is terrific, and their green beans are the best I have had anywhere. Worth the drive from elsewhere in the GTA."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been around for many years now and I like to come here when I'm craving for Shanghai food. I like that it's never too busy (at least when I go) and the homely vibe it gives.  In general, love their food. I haven't been too adventurous with their menu and usually stick to signature Shanghai dishes (pictures below). For the peanut noodle, you can ask them to make it less spicy  depending on your tolerance. Rich peanut sauce but not too heavy/thick.   In conclusion, it's honestly cooking so nothing is too strongly flavored (no MSG/salt overload). Would recommend everyone to give it a try :)"}
{"text":"If you dont like the food here, it's likely because you don't know how to order.  Someone mentioned that this place is not a shanghainese dimsum place, but a taiwanese restaurant...well the reality is that most places that serve good shanghai dimsum were opened by taiwanese (ding tai fung in taiwan, for example). At any rate, the soup dumplings, and all kinds of other dumplings are all shanghainese cuisine, so are the fried noodles and any form of rice cake.    I used to LOVE this place growing up. The owner of the place was related to ding tai fong in first markham place but I always thought the food here is a little better than FMP. I don't know if they switched owners by now, but I came back yesterday and the food quality has not changed.  I always order to start their spicy beef tendon (when i was little i used to get my parents to buy just that for takeout when we're in the area). Another staple I eat there is the rice cake stir-fried with pickled vegetables...a little salty but delicious.  I also love their peapod stems stir-fried with garlic.   I'm so glad i went back yesterday to satisfy my craving. No matter how many times i go to Asian Legend, it just does not compare."}
{"text":"We sometimes eat later than 9pm and it's hard to find a variety of restaurants that close after 10pm in Markham.  369 has been around forever but for some reason we never ate there and just walk past it all th time. We tried it last Friday since they close at 11pm, and we had the steamed pork dumplings, beef and glass noodle soup, and a baked beef pastry (kind of like peking duck wraps).    All the food was flavorful and probably saltier than my normal palate, but we didn't have an MSG attack afterward at all.  The decor was also tasteful and warm, and they opted out of using booth seating which never quite gets the table height right.  The tea was also not watered down and tasted ok since it was complimentary."}
{"text":"I think this place is pretty average. The spicy beef noodle soup is pretty good. It's actually spicy and flavourful with very tender beef brisket (better than ding tai fung). But their xiao long bao and pan fried dumplings were alright..I've had better.   Point is, pretty average food, service and pricing. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Really enjoy the Shanghai fried noodle.. the portion is big and the noodle has a lot of texture and the nice aroma of mushroom... yumm  The stir fried dishes can get a little oily.. I usually tell them not to use too much oil when I place my order.  The wait staffs are all nice and friendly.  Open until 11pm, a great place to go for late dinner.."}
{"text":"This is my favourite dim sum place for Shanghai food. I've tried Ding Tai Fung but I find that this place has better food which is less greasy. My party ordered many dishes and particularly enjoyed the jellyfish and shredded turnip appetizer, the Shanghai style noodles, the wonton soup, the eggplant in chili sauce and the noodle soup with savoury stewed beef. The food was flavourful but not too salty or oily. Although the prices aren't cheap, the food is worth the price.  The restaurant is fairly small so coming here in parties of 8+, especially when the restaurant is busy may be a challenge. All in all, I would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Little bit on the pricey side but quite delicious. Shanghai fried noodles were really good. And xiao long bao was tasty.  Green onion pancake is a rip though. 4 dollars for 4 small slices."}
{"text":"We had a vehicle to run some errands, and my handsome chauffeur wanted to try the famous Markham Chinese food. Sooo off we went on our journey north to the land of Chinese strip malls and savoury scents.  My Shanghai Dim Sum knowledge isn't the best. I call buns dumplings, and I blindly ordered just about everything aside from the hot and sour soup. I wasn't disappointed by any of it. I was especially happy with the orange and wine pork ribs and the Shanghai fried noodles. Deeelish.   Yes, you're eating in a strip mall, so it isn't very fancy and you'll look pretty cruddy under the fluorescent lights... but who cares? It tastes the same, nay better, in Markham if it's Chinese treats you're after."}
{"text":"The food is a hit and miss here, but it's still a great place and I enjoy most of my visits! This is the place I go **CURRENTLY** when I crave Shanghai food (I'm still on the lookout for the best Shanghai dim sum in Toronto!!!) because it's pretty close to my house.  I stopped coming here when I discovered an amazing Shanghai dim sum restaurant in Scarborough years ago. However, it closed and I returned to 369 Shanghai...  Service is extremely fast. My family usually orders 6-8 dishes and the food (at least 4 of our orders) is served in less than 5 minutes. Our tea hasn't even cooled yet.   ===========IN SUMMARY: food is hit and miss:  ------------Hot and Sour soup: Large: enough for 6 rice bowls  *On MISS days: it's still quite flavorful, it just doesn't have the spicy part. I'd say it's way too mild and not worth getting.  *On HIT days: It's well done, 4 stars!  ------------Soup Dumplings / xiaolongbao Skin breaks quite easily. NOTE the two versions! First one is the original with pork meat, the second one is made with crab meat instead.  *On MISS days: when they place the dumplings beside each other (since the bamboo basket is so small), the skin tend to stick to other dumplings. So when you pick one up, the skin will rip because it's attached to others... The soup inside will spill everywhere, AND THE MEAT will break apart too. The meat is soft and already in pieces (it's not \"balled-up\" well), so that's why it also comes out when your dumpling rips. Sometimes the dumplings aren't that hot...  *On HIT days: when you can pick one up perfectly without breaking the skin (meaning the skin is held together well, but still thin enough so it doesn't taste like flour), the dumpling is quite good. 3.5 stars.  ------------Wonton in spicy soup/sauce (I forget the menu name!) I love this dish, but I am bias because I've never had this anywhere else! There are about 10 small wontons drenched in dark red spicy sauce. The sauce is so red it actually looks pretty scary for the faint of hearts.   *On MISS days: Am I becoming immune to this?? Sometimes it's just not spicy. If you want to try this but are not prepared for the spiciness, maybe hope for a MISS!  *On HIT days: When this is spicy, OH MY it is deeelish.   ------------Beef Soup Noodle Hmm this one is pretty decent here. I prefer the original Beef Soup Noodle (thick noodles) over the other one (glass noodles). Glass noodles tend to soak up all the soup... This isn't very yummy when the soup is gone.  The beef soup here is flavorful enough for my taste (I don't like a strong one), and there are plenty of beef to share!  ------------ALL OTHER DUMPLINGS: I've had quite a few different dumpling dishes, and overall I'd rate them 3.5 stars. Sometimes the skin is too thick, but the meat is almost always plentiful (which is highly important!! wtf are dumplings with only a dime amount of meat!?)  ===========IN CONCLUSION I still come here and I enjoy the food! I love Shanghai dim sum in general and my expectations for Shanghai dim sum is very high, hence the critical 3 stars.   Nonetheless, I recommend this place! I mean, it's still in business after so many years, with the SAME STAFF (some) for 5+ years! One of the servers didn't speak Cantonese but she learned it when working here. Today, she speaks it fluently!"}
