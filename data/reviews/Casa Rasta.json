{"text":"What a hidden GEM! 

Why this is one of my new favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh: 
- It doesn't take itself too seriously but you still feel like you're getting a good quality experience and even more important, quality food. 
- Speaking of, the food....YUM. This menu is wonderful, a WIDE variety of things, many I have never seen in Pittsburgh before. We ordered some of every type of meat (the chorizo was our fav!), some wings, guac (delish!) and the plantains for dessert.
- The waitress was great- I think it would be helpful for them to have more than 1 server for the entire restaurant because the poor girl did look a bit frantic at some points but she handled it well for being the only server there. 
- The cost is super reasonable and allows you to try multiple things on their menu which is great, because believe me, you'll want to. 

Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Good tacos - quick service - nothing bad to say about this place - planning on going back to check out the Friday / Saturday special"}
{"text":"Food are full of flavors and reasonably priced. We tried it for the first time today and the presentation of the tacos is just beautiful! Jerk chicken tacos are excellent as well as the curry shrimp one. Will try the rice entree next time, the table besides us ordered the goat rice dish and it looks good."}
{"text":"We've eaten here twice now and enjoyed it both times.  My 9-year old daughter LOVES the rice.  The black beans are perfectly cooked and delicious on their own or with the rice.  I got the same thing both times because it was so good - both vegetarion options as tostadas.  The guacamole and salsas are very yummy and the chips are some root vegetable that I can't recall but they were perfectly crisp and delicious with the salsa and guac.  It's BYOB.  We'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for lunch at Casa Rasta last week. It was so good! I'm so proud of small businesses in Pittsburgh and this is one of them that I really praise for so many reasons. The food is affordable, I like that it's BYOB and there isn't a bar full of drunk people, it's quiet, the staff is nice, and the food is great. 
   We had the chips and two salsas, I had a chicken taco, and my husband had the vegetarian taco. All were very good and the staff was polite, fast, and not overbearing. We were filled up and actually still full past dinner time and our entire bill was less than 15 dollars. 
    It's so important that we support local businesses like this one. If we don't, our city streets will be filled with Taco Bells inside of Walmarts. Keep the love going for this place and others like it."}
{"text":"Great Food.. We started w/Avocado fries then had a sample of the veggie tacos, and shrimp diavlo burrito... YumYum!! Server was Great too..!"}
{"text":"We tried an assortment of tacos and the jerk chicken wings they were all amazing!  It is very cute inside and the owners are super friendly!"}
{"text":"Casa Rasta has combined with LasPalmas but they are not closed.  We have eaten there before the merger and after and it is still fantastic.  The menu has changed but is still very eclectic.  We try something different each time and have not been disappointed.  My only complaint is that no one answers the phone when you call.  A answering machine is fine, but it should clarify that they are indeed still in business!"}
{"text":"Things have changed so much here in the past two years. We used to order takeout from here at least once a week and would stop and eat-in occasionally. Many times bringing our out of town guests along. There was a point sometime after going to the bigger location, everything began to dropoff. When picking up food, there is no designated hostess or place to set up shop and many times it was several minutes before you could get someone's attention. We would be told 20 mins for pickup and the food would be ready nearly an hour later. The quality of the food has gone down as well, just as the price has gone up. I hate to write a negative review, but I get sad and frustrated that we can no longer get the food and service we used to enjoy so regularly. It's just not worth the hassle anymore. It's not even on our list anymore."}
{"text":"Had one of the worst dining experiences in recent memory here.  If they weren't claiming to still be in their soft opening I'd give them one star.  

The chips and guacamole were embarrassingly bad.  The chips were some sort of store bought Trader Joe's crappy tortilla chips.  At least have the decency to give me Tostitos.  The guacamole may have once been green but I'm not so sure.  The portion was tiny for $6, but frankly it didn't matter because it wasn't worth eating anyway.  My rice was dry, my veggie taco flaccid.  Their salsa verde was delicious.

The service was atrocious.  The place wasn't even full and our server was complaining about being swamped in the kitchen.  We ordered our entrees and waited...and waited...and every time a server walked out of the kitchen we hoped it was our food.  Our server headed for our table and let us know that she \"just found out\" that they were out of chiles rellenos.  This was at a time when we should have been finishing up our meal, but instead we're starting from scratch.  I explained that we were in a bit of a hurry as we were trying to get to a concert, so please bring whatever can be made quickly.  Again too much time passed and eventually our mediocre food came.  And it took forever to pay the bill, of course.  All in all it took over an hour to get 7 tacos in a not full restaurant.

I am in no way a high maintenance diner and I understand mistakes happen, and I'm completely open to giving restaurants a chance to make it right.  But once I explained we were in a hurry (due to their incredibly slow pace) there was no sense of urgency on their part.  I won't be heading back."}
{"text":"I am writing this as I sit at my table, so I'll keep this short. I was here several years ago and it was a fantastic experience. However, I came here today and it is completely different aside from the name. They now serve Mexican food (not Caribbean )... which isn't bad in of itself, but read on. 

They are out of ice. They don't have carnitas. They waited until our entree arrived to give us silverware. And there was bone in my chicken burrito. And we aren't even done with our lunch yet. It takes a lot to get me to write out a review on the spot, especially after a long hiatus... but my current experience has compelled me to do so. 

Whatever Casa Rasta once was, it is no more. I won't come back again."}
{"text":"Wow. Drove from Cincinnati for research and had a taco trio.  Strong. Al pastor and her chicken magnificent. Avocado fries were a delicious start."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.   I have never had such unique and fresh food.  I slot of their food is vegan oriented and our server told us they use all organic food.   You can always taste the difference.   It is a small place so when it gets busy(which happens often) it make take a while but it's worth it.   It only seats about 30 people so if your one of those people who likes to complain about how long it takes to get your food this place may not be for you.   Personally I can never get enough of their food.  My favorite is the jambalaya.  It's spicy and has a little if everything."}
{"text":"From the jerk chicken to the goat and the pickled mangos, everything was awesome!!!  Service was quick and very friendly. It is BYOB so bring your tequila and they will mix you up a margarita."}
{"text":"I loved this place when it was a little hole in the wall taco shop run by a nice couple.  When it moved into the old Lunardi's location and started getting a ton of business, I was truly happy for them, and pleased to have such a great, low-priced small business in my neighborhood. 

Since the move, Casa Rasta has gone severely downhill.  I have been there 3 times, and can honestly say it has some of the worst service I have ever experienced.  They are always out of something, and several things on the menu are blacked out.  During my last visit, it took 1 hour and 10 minutes for my food to arrive.  My party of 3 waited about 5 minutes to be seated, and then waited another 10 minutes to have a jug of water brought to the table. Said jug was never refilled.  It was partially the server's fault, but also the fault of management for only having one server and one hostess on staff when more were clearly needed.  

The reason I didn't give them 1 star is because the food is pretty good, though a little overpriced.  I am used to getting $2 tacos from them, not $15 meals.  

I hope this place turns around, because I'd like to have a nice restaurant in Beechview. I won't be back anytime soon, though."}
{"text":"I love this place so much I joined Yelp just to communicate how amazing Casa Rasta is. Tacos are great even when they're awful but these tacos aren't awful at all they are actually the best. The carnitas tacos are amazing. Pickled onions are involved! And Mexican Cokes! Both salsas were terrific and perfectly spicy. This is my favorite meal in Pittsburgh at the moment and it is also incredibly inexpensive. The best part is you can eat tacos and then get pizza at Slice when you are finished! Why not? Seriously, because I don't even know about things that are better than pizza and tacos. Maybe puppies but I probably wouldn't like to eat one of those."}
{"text":"This was awful. I never write bad reviews but this was unacceptable. The service was extremely slow, it took an hour and a half to get appetizers out alone. When food did come out our waitress said \"I hope this was worth the wait\".  It was not. When the main food came out it was cold, covered in salt and bland. I do not recommend this place to anyone. We sat at the bar and we saw when they took dirty glasses, they dipped them in water and then reused them. What is going on at this restaurant? Stay away!"}
{"text":"We split a jerk chicken wing appetizer, it was tasty enough. I am a fan of the 'avocado cream', which I have not had before now. I had the Al Pastor burrito, I liked that the pineapple was roasted. My friend had the Carnitas burrito, which I was not as much of a fan of because it was a little bland / subtler... not really citrusy at all."}
{"text":"As an update, I took a work-group here (about 20 people) for lunch and it was still great... they were very accommodating of anything my group needed.  People ate and drank like crazy, and it was still only around $400.  Not bad for 20 people.  Just opens up the possibility of this place being good for work meetings, and not just at night..."}
{"text":"They are not closed.  I hope they can work this incorrect information.  My wife and I stopped here late on a Monday night.  We had the Goat Curry and the Chicken Enchiladas.  They were happy to put on a spicier sauce as we requested on the enchiladas and  even brought out samples for us.  The goat curry had a nice jerk sauce.  Meat was fatty but this is typical of goat and it was well cooked."}
{"text":"This place is closed now. The building now is a las plamas owned restaurant and its pretty bad. Dry bland food. The staffs great but they need better cooking. The taco stand is so much better and half the price. This place needs to get its act together fast."}
{"text":"A group of five friends ate \"family style\" (shared everything), allowing us to sample a wide variety of dishes. Group consensus was that the chicken flautas and jerk chicken burrito were the highlights, though nothing went uneaten! I personally especially enjoyed the jambalaya, though it was a bit spicy for a few of our group's more timid eaters. The green sausage had a neat look, but it tastes suspiciously like sausage of other colors. 

Service was very good, and the BYOB policy was appreciated as we enjoyed margaritas while dining. 

The churros, served with ice cream and chocolate sauce, were a delicious finish to the meal. While the restaurant has an out of the way feel, I'll certainly be back!"}
{"text":"We moved to Beechview back in April and Casa Rasta was the restaurant we visited to celebrate when we got the keys to our new house. Our first visit there was amazing. So jaw-droppingly amazing that we have tried to go back to redeem all of our bad experiences and we keep leaving severely disappointed. While we hope the service and the food will improve, we are skeptical and have decided to take our support of local businesses elsewhere (particularly to El Milagro, on the other side of Beechview).

Our past 5 visits we went they have been out of at least 2 items -- ironically, it would seem, they are always the items that I want to order. So disappointment #1.

Since just prior to the opening of their East Liberty location, service has gone down the tubes. We often know more about the food than the servers, and we never have a visit to Casa Rasta last less than an hour -- even when our selections are easy, like tacos and burritos. It often takes at least 20 minutes for someone to come take our order, and then it often takes 30-40 minutes for our food to get out, even when the place is empty. When it's packed, be ready for a 2-hour visit. So, disappointment #2.

Additionally, the past handful of visits, at least one person in our party's food has been not just lukewarm, but cold. That being said, you feel like it's hardly worth complaining about because even when you send in complaints via email, you never get a response, and if you mention it there in the restaurant, you'd be waiting another 30 minutes just to get hot food when you've already likely waited for 45 minutes. So, disappointment #3."}
{"text":"Unique to Pittsburgh, fresh ingredients, and a tasty fusion of Caribbean and Mexican food.  A must if you live Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"We accidentally found this small unassuming but attractive restaurant when nearby Davio was closed. Standard Mexican fare with some innovative twists. I had fried duck - often a risky choice in any restaurant - the tendency is that the duck is not fresh or over-cooked and dry. I was pleasantly surprised to encounter moist tasty duck meat with delicious side order of mashed potatoes. Salad was fresh - a bit lemony as per Mediterranean taste. Corn soup was tasty but too salty as is typical of Pittsburgh restaurants. Chocolate hazel nut cheesecake was good but a too sweet for my liking. Excellent friendly service. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Had the pulled pork burrito. Delicious! They had different salsas on the table but they weren't needed because it was so good. Friendly, outside seating, reasonably priced....I'll be back"}
{"text":"Wow.

Found this restaurant here on Yelp, and figured I would give it a try.  I was not disappointed!  

Appetizer - Avocado fries.  These were crispy and perfectly cooked, although I would have liked a few more of them!

Dinner - Tacos of course!  I had the beef, jerk chicken, and chorizo verde tacos.  All were very well seasoned and cooked nicely.  Tacos are on soft corn tortilllas, and are small enough to finish off in about 4 bites.  I like that the main ingredient is the meat, not large amounts of lettuce and pico like you see in many places.  No cheese either, which was not missed.  Fresh cilantro, mangoes, and onions kept each of my tacos bright and really tasty!

Dessert - I wasn't going to have any, but my waitress talked me into the truffles, which were amazing.  Chocolate truffle with whipped cream in a phyllo cup with a piece of dried kiwi to garnish.  Small, beautiful, with a surprise chili inside for a bit of kick to wrap up the meal.  Very nice!

Only con:  no alcohol (BYOB only), and I would have enjoyed a nice margarita with such a tasty meal."}
{"text":"When I think of a cheap place to eat with excellent food I always think of Casa Rasta, and I am never let down. I have tried their jerk chicken wings which were good, their citrus chicken torta which was refreshing and had fresh mangos on the sandwich, and by far my all time favorite is their pulled pork torta. This torta has a lot of pulled pork on top of black beans with avocado, a little bit of white shredded cheese (not too sure what kind) and what seem to be pickled onions. I put the complimentary salsas on top and it is divine. On Friday and Saturdays they have specials. I always get the curried shrimp tacos. This comes with rice, cilantro, some vegetable (I forgot what, shreddred carrots perhaps?) and shrimp that smells delicious and yellow from the turmeric. The corn tortillas tastes hand made. Also, the pork pork they put on their pork tacos smells like bacon. 

You order and pay when you walk in, then you sit down. The one owner then brings your food. I always bring my plates in when I am done. 

The outdoor sitting area is very nice and comfortable. The noise level just depends on how many people are there. I have sat inside and out and it was quiet, inside the cooks usually have music playing, always reggae when I was there. Once it was dinner time, crowded and I was outside. It was kind of noisy and kids were playing on the sidewalk. 

The food is great and I will always be coming back (unless prices are raised way too high, but I pray that day never comes!). I usually get a torta and a taco and the price always comes around $12. 

I would recommend this place for anyone looking for a cheap tasty meal. The owners a very nice and run a good restaurant."}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly.  The space is small and is not the place to go to when your in a rush.  I would highly recommend the fajitas.  They are seasoned very well and by far the tastiest I have had.   The red salsa is good has a little tang to it.  I will not got to another place for fajitas.  I would recommend trying them."}
{"text":"Ordered the jerk wings and plantains and they were BEYOND mediocre. Could've gotten better wings at wing stop honestly. The plantains were about $5 for 4.....which is crazy and they were very crispy. A friend ordered the salsa verde chicken enchilada and the chicken was really dry. Definitely felt like a waste."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled, this place is actually very good.  The food is fresh, made to order,and has a great homemade taste, and so it should seeing as the owner, a Mexico City native, cooks the food.  Cant be beat!  Lots of selection and very reasonably priced :}  


Plenty of outdoor parking available.  Try their Pulled Pork and the Jamaican Wings."}
{"text":"Been there three times, twice they didn't have guacamole.  Took the family on Thursday night to hear live reggae, which they had confirmed when I called earlier in the day.  Ordered guac...no guac.  Ordered beef with mole...we're out of mole.  Wife ordered carnitas, after long wait, waitress came back and informed her they were out of carnitas.  I think any problems relate to laissez faire management.  Service is slow because they don't pay for enough staff.  Food takes long b/c there is only room for one cook in the tiny kitchen.  Food definitely tasty, but don't plan on getting in and out in an hour.  Would be a good place to sit, spend time with friends, eat some tasty small plates, listen to reggae.  Oh yeah, the band never showed up that night, either!"}
{"text":"Good food and service at a reasonable price. Location is  pretty small, but the food comes fast after ordering. The avocado fries were good but a bit pricey. The tacos were well priced and the quesadilla was really good. Good number of vegetarian options as well!"}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place!!!  The first few times I came here I ordered the tacos and some appetizers.    They were awesome! We have since come back many times and the food is always amazing!  Great place"}
{"text":"The best authentic Mexican/ Carribean food in Pottsburgh! We had the avocado fries, the salsa that came along was the bomb! My husband ordered the goat curry which came along with rice and beans and fried plantains- Absolutely Delicious. There truffle was the most amazing shit I have eaten in a long long time. It's kinda out of the city but very well worth the drive if you like Authentic food."}
{"text":"If you're looking for excellent, quick service: don't come here. If you're looking for some fancy, 5-star cuisine and ambiance: don't come here. If you're looking for a laid-back spot to nom on some casual fare: come here (and bring a bottle of Cuervo with you!)

I've had some of the worst service in my life, here. No exaggeration. Servers routinely know little to nothing about the menu, take an obscenely long time to accommodate requests, and time delivery of food so poorly (Yes, of course I want my appetizer to come out at the exact same time as my entree! How did you know?!) Maybe it's the vibe. Maybe it's the reggae. Maybe it's the tequila. But, somehow, the atrocious service here doesn't push my buttons the way it does at other restaurants. I forgive you, Casa Rasta... Because the food is sooooo yummy.

Diablo shrimp tacos. Soyrizo burritos. Potato flautas. The stuff that dreams are made of. I often get all three, because they're too good to choose between. It's like picking a favorite child.

Caveats: make a reservation, no matter what. There are only about ten tables, and nothing could be more heartbreaking than getting amped up to eat your weight in guacamole only to be turned away. Also, be prepared for them to run out things. Whoever handles their inventory could use some help, I think. But, all the positives outweigh the negatives, and this is one of my favorite spots in the city."}
{"text":"Visited with a vegetarian friend, because she loves the tofu options.

I ordered three tacos, and chips with salsa. The \"red\" salsa was inedibly salty, as in \"soy sauce\" salty. The green was pretty good, and the chips were thin, fresh and crispy.

The tacos were awful. The chorizo taco was literally a spoonful of ground chorizo (beef?) on a corn tortilla with a few specs of raw white onion and cilantro. Boring. The pulled pork taco was exactly the same. The jerk chicken taco actually had some toppings on it, mango and pickled something with an avocado sauce, but the chicken tasted rancid (seriously, it was not right) and I declined to eat it. They were nice enough to take it off my bill.

My friend's jerk tofu was actually quite good. Spicy and perfectly cooked, with rice and a few delicious friend plantains with mango and pickled something (I'm not sure what).

I don't live in this city, but if I did, I wouldn't recommend it except for the tofu. It was a strange experience."}
{"text":"Casa Rasta is slowing becoming one of my favorite places in the Pittsburgh area. Between the taco choices and entree options there's enough of a spread on the menu to accomodate a large group of customers with certain preferences. Being from the south, I had to partake in their version of Jambalaya and it sent me back to the stuff that we grow up down south on. Heat, but flavorful and had it's own Caribbean spin on it. 

The Al Pastor Taco is one of the best tacos in the city.

BYOB which is never a bad thing.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"All I can say is that I was disappointed with my entire experience here. Starting off with the service. When we walked in the place was packed but the server who greated us said that we could wait in the \"bar\" area and that she would let us know when a table was ready. While we waited at the \"bar\" the guy who was working their asked us if we wanted any appetizers while we waited and we asked for some of their yucca chips and salsa. Apparently they were out of the yucca chips just like the last time I was here. Come on it's 6:45pm on a Friday and you are out of chips and salsa?!?!? We reiterated to the guy working at the \"bar\" that we were waiting on a table. After 1 hour and multiple couples without reservations (we were sitting near the door and they asked everyone who came in if they had reservations, none had any.) were seated prior to us we opted to just eat at the bar. This presented the next hurdle since the guy behind the bar thought we were waiting on a table he paid no attention to us and we had to waive someone down. We each ordered a taco and a burrito, with a side of mexican rice and beans. The Tacos were not overly enticing, They tasted okay but the fact that they were luke warm as was the burrito, I was not impressed. The Black beans were so salty that they were inedible, they should have been dumped and I love salt. The new menu that I was told would be rolled out in the near future when I visited a few months ago is not to be. Heck the menu that they do have has actually lost some items by simply blacking them out.
 In the end it took us 2 hours to eat a taco and a burrito each. To be honest I would have rather went the grocery store and cranked up a tastier dinner in less time for less. It appeared that their system of operation is chaotic and disorganized.
I do give them five stars for the authenticity of a tourist trap in the Caribbean, you all know ,you see a place while traveling that looks legit and then a few hours later you finally get outta there and wish you wouldn't have wasted your time."}
{"text":"Excellent meal had lunch wife and I....curry goat was gooood.  Would be better if they served ginger beer.. and not tap water..next time I'll bring my own beverage..other than that ok"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff, live music! Best part for me is they were an unlisted vegetarian vegan option! Tons of delicious options."}
{"text":"Had the worst dinning experience in my life here tonight (58 years)!  We made a reservation at approximately 11 am this morning for 7 pm tonight.  We were a party of 12.  A new, inexperienced waitress was assigned to our table.  We were aware the waitress was new and we're accepting of this small inconveinence.  We have all been in her shoes.  The food, while very good, was inconsistent in arrival and size, ex. We received three orders of guacamole all of differing size ... from 3/4c to 2 Tbsp.  An hour after ordering, our entrees began to arrive.  We then learned that half of those who order entrees w/beef would not be receiving their order because the restaurant was out of beef.  The chef/owner and an experienced waitress were confrontational and unapologetic for their poor planning and service.  They blame the new, inexperienced waitress for the entire horrid experience.  She was the only employee at the restaurant who tried to provide true customer service.  While the food appears to be inventive and flavorful, Unfortunately it was clear the chef/owner does not have a clue how to manage a restaurant or an understanding of basic customer service!  As we left, he swore at us in Spanish, those of us from Florida and Houston easily understood him.  F- for customer service!"}
{"text":"Ive been here about 4 or 5 times now and every time the food is great. The last time the service was a little slow but there were only 2 servers and our server had a large group so I wasnt too bothered. The Avocado Fries are awesome and Im a huge fan of the Jamaican Jerk Chicken Burrito. Im excited to try out the new location in the near future."}
{"text":"Used to be my favorite restaurant in the \"Burgh\" Used to love the Jamaican Jerk Chicken Burrito, until Las Palmas bought it and it then went completely down hill. Real shame too"}
{"text":"I remember being completely underwhelmed by this place.  You're taking two cuisines that should be tasty,  and what I ended up with in my plate lacked any flavor. The  tacos were bland and overpriced, the jerk chicken was spicy without any flavor, and the side of mango it came with was a joke,  as it was tiny and looked like the garnish of a cocktail.  The coconut rice was even bland. 

Service was also bad. Not returning."}
{"text":"This tiny treasure in the heart of Beechview has some of the best tacos and burritos I have ever tasted. Luckily, the night my roommates and I ventured out here, curried goat was the special. And boy was it special! If you are ever in the area, even if you're not, you should definitely go out of your way to check this place out. Food was VERY fresh and the service was super friendly. A must have, for sure."}
{"text":"I am a recent transplant to Pittsburgh from Chicago, which is a serious foodie city. I must say, though, that Casa Rasta has been one of the best places I have eaten in either city! As a vegetarian, I am used to most restaurants only having a couple options for me. However, the menu at Casa Rasta is amazing for vegetarians! For an appetizer we had the avocado fries and yuca chips, which were delicious. I am not usually a fan of avocado, but these were great. For our entrees we had the coconut tofu and potato flautas. Both were fantastic. The coconut tofu was a little spicy for my dinnermate, but I thought it was perfectly fine (he is a 0 spice kind of guy). We finished it off with a yummy chocolate-hazelnut cheesecake. I keep thinking about going back because there were so many other vegetarian options that sounded great that I wanted to try. The restaurant is very small and byob. If you go during normal dinner hours, be prepared for a short wait."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place after looking it up online......Never Again! Horrible food. Server was very unaware of what was going on. Every question asked about the menu she had no clue.  You can definitely tell the difference between someone who enjoys their job and someone who is just there for a paycheck. Not to mention food being unavailable. We ordered the Jambalaya, Coconut Tofu and Jerk Tofu..... horrible. The rice was not cooked all the way. Food was hard and very bland!  The Jambalaya was straight out of a Zatarain's box with some Jamaican seasoning... as a business owner, professional chef, world traveler and foodie this was by far the worst food I have ever had... overpriced and underrepresented.....


 Waste of money...

Staff needs to be trained better on customer service...."}
{"text":"Really laid back place - hands down the most awesome jambalaya, the fried avocados were quite good - byob $0.50 per beer"}
{"text":"Just ate here for the first time. It was fantastic, and I will be back whenever I am in town! The service was wonderful. The food was simple, cheap and absolutely delightful. The flavor was out of this world. Unlike anything I have ever tried before."}
{"text":"Just go. Seriously. If you don't like it then there's probably something wrong with you. Just moved here from NYC and this place is now our go-to Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"I am editing my review and adding a star because of the owner's thoughtful and sincere response to my earlier posting. I really appreciate when a business owner takes the time to respond to online reviews and I would love to see this particular restaurant do well. As a vegan it means a lot to me when restaurants offer vegetarian alternatives. While my first experience wasn't the most positive, I can see that others have had much better experiences. It may have been an off day, so I will keep an open mind and maybe stop back the next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"We haven't even received our food yet and have been told that they are out of the following:
1. Kids cups
2. Guacamole (!)
3. Avocado fries 
4. Quinoa and cilantro soup
5. Red chorizo
6. Red salsa (one of the two salsa options)

When our facial expressions clearly registered disbelief, the explanation given was, \"We had a busy night last night so we ran out.\" So this means they don't make fresh food for lunch when they run out of things?! We aren't here at an odd time either - it's Saturday at noon!

In this era of instant online reviews, one would think that a restaurant (especially in prime real estate) would make more of an effort.

Update: The food is not redeeming. Hard rice, salty beans, and lukewarm entrees (clearly just barely defrosted). They forgot to bring out the chips we ordered. It was awful all-around."}
{"text":"We ate here for Valentines day and we're really looking forward to their traditional menu.  Unfortunately they had a completely different menu than they usually have so it was a little bit of a let down. 

We ordered duck and also the lobster (they only had two options). While the duck was very good, I was not a fan of the lobster at all. 

The quinoa soup was great and the mushroom seviche was very good too.  I just wish we knew about the fixed menu for V-Day

There food is almost Always really good, I just wasn't super impressed with it this time.  Especially not at 40.00 per person"}
{"text":"I went a couple of weeks ago for the first time with my boyfriend and some friends. I was eager to try it out. It was 7:00 on a Saturday and the server told us they were out of chips. I asked if they had tortillas or tostadas so I broke them up by myself. She told me they wouldn't \"charge me extra\". Next, they were out of CHICKEN for tacos, jambalaya, etc. but they still had a chicken breast for an entrée?? You can't shred it/cut it up?? THEN they were out of hot sauce. So, you're a Mexican restaurant and you are out of chips, chicken, AND hot sauce?! As a business, you can't go to the store before Saturday night service to prepare for the evening? This was beyond a disappointing experience. I would only hope the original restaurant was better. Although I work around the corner, I will most likely consider other restaurants nearby."}
{"text":"Good food, but I wasn't a fan of the atmosphere or service. It left a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"Give's SMOKE a run for the money for best tacos in Pittsburgh.  The taco's here are awesome.  Carnita's are amazing.  I would have given them six stars but they are all the way in Beechview.  Maybe their second restaurant will be in the east end!  Either way, see you next week casa rasta!"}
{"text":"I have been eating at both Las Palmas and Casa Rasta for years and was ALWAYS impressed with both their authenticity, quality and great food. Im deeply dismayed to say that having combined the 2 eateries I got NONE of those. Food was bland, somehow they got rid of all the Caribbean ambiance with actually removing anything, and jacked up the prices. Also, they had these tiny menus that were basically unreadable to order food, so you really had no idea what you were ordering, tho the waitress was friendly and happy to explain it. Im dismayed to say I probably wont be back to this restaurant I used to be a frequent diner."}
{"text":"Excellent !! Carribean Jerk Chicken and rice from Casa Rasta at the Taste of Beechview,just delicious. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Simply the most delicious tacos that I have ever eaten.  And in walking distance to my Beechview home, makes this a great urban living ecperience."}
{"text":"As much as I really want to give Casa Rasta a 3 star update, their food and the laid-back byob atmosphere continue to be its saving grace.

Unfortunately, that same laid-back environment is its biggest downfall.  After a bad experience at Casa (following what were typically good experiences at their original smaller location) we decided to give it another go.  Unfortunately, the same issues we experienced when they moved to their larger location endure months later.  On two occasions now, a majority of the menu has been unavailable and the service has been downright terrible.  Long wait times following being seated, infrequent visits, and worse of all, 1-1.5 hour plus waits for simple food that doesn't really dictate that kind of turnaround.

Casa Rasta will likely pull me in one more time before the end of summer (I can't help it), but a third strike will definitely put this promising establishment out of my repertoire of go-to's."}
{"text":"(note - they are NOT closed as Yelp is indicating... this is incorrect )

They joined forces with the Berumen family aka Las Palmas ...
Word on the street and my opinion is that it's  better now, with the added recipes and concepts ...
I highly recommend getting barbacoa in any form you fancy ...
The main entrees are good, too if, a little expensive ...
The chips & salsas that they bring out after you sit down are to die for ... the one with the avocado chunks in it is ridiculously good ... I thought about getting a bunch, to go ... 
Great colorful atmosphere and Mexican folk music on the sound system ...
If you like your Latin/Mexican food and are anywhere in the PGH area --- drop what you're doing and go chow , asap ...
I'm planning on several more visits ."}
{"text":"Jahh...

Casta Rasta hooked me up with an awesome pulled pork burrito. The spicy pork was definitely spliced up with onions and red peppers.

If you're eating in you'll receive two types of salsa. One is a green salsa delight that  when mixed with some Cholula is a perfect 1 - 2 punch to begin every bite of any burrito. I polished off my meal with an old style glass bottle of Fanta. 

I will come back to listen to reggae and gobble down some of Casta Rasta's fine grub for sure."}
{"text":"Our experience here was SO BAD that we were convinced it was part of some social experiment to determine:

1) How long people would wait for their food,
2) How bad the food would have to be, and
3) How ridiculous the portions/prices would have to be

for the guests to get up and leave.

Our party of 10 arrived shortly after 8pm and was seated outside on the sidewalk. We brought our own beers and ordered a couple of baskets of yuca chips with guacamole. Our chips arrived within a couple of minutes, but with salsa instead of guacamole. When our server came back we asked about the guacamole and were told they were out. We then ordered two servings of jamaican jerk wings and tried to order another two baskets of chips but were told they were out of chips as well. We then tried to order the avocado fries and were told they were out of those too.

Our server came out with the wings in a couple of minutes. We ordered an additional two baskets of wings, three orders of the queso fundido, and our entrees. This was around 8:15pm.

ONE HOUR LATER we still had not received any of our food and it had been about 30 minutes since we'd seen our server. I went inside and politely asked the bartender if she could check on our order because it had been about an hour and we hadn't received our appetizers or entrees. She replied, \"We make all of our food fresh so it takes longer than a chain restaurant. When you come here, there's always a bit of a wait for food.\" Um, ok?

About ten minutes later (approximately 9:20pm) our server came outside and explained that there were still two tickets ahead of us and our appetizers had not been started yet. We asked if our entrees had been started, because if they hadn't we would've just paid for the two orders of chips and wings and left. We were starving and freezing. She said yes, the entrees had already been started, so we stayed. 

Around 9:30pm our server came back with the two additional orders of wings, as well as two baskets of chips for us to munch on. (We thought they were out??) She explained that because of the wait, they would waive the $0.50 \"corkage fee\" for the bottles of beer. How nice - you're comping us something that it costs you literally NOTHING to do.

A few minutes after that she returned with the three orders of queso fundido. The vegetarians in our party were so hungry that we scarfed the pickled mango salsa that came with the wings. We were told repeatedly by our main server (as well as an additional helper) that there's always a wait for food because they make everything fresh. Only ONCE did someone apologize for the wait.

At 9:52pm, ONE HOUR AND FORTY MINUTES after we'd ordered, our entrees finally arrived. I'd ordered the \"Chiles Relleños.\" As described on the menu, they are \"Cheese filled poblano peppers drizzled with a walnut and goat cheese cream sauce, garnished with pomegranate seeds.\" This entree costs $10. What I actually got was ONE pepper (not pepperS) in a small bowl. No sides. I asked the server if it was only supposed to be one pepper and she said yes. Then why is it called ChileS RelleñoS and described as pepperS?!? As my friend remarked, \"$10 for a pepper?! That's not even California prices!\"

Two people ordered the $15 Jamaican Jerk Tofu, \"served with mango, plantains and coconut rice.\" There were no plantains and the tofu was extremely salty. It tasted like it had been marinated in spicy soy sauce.

We finished our food within 10 minutes and our plates were quickly cleared. Three couples asked for separate checks and the remaining four people were put on a fourth check. Our server asked us how we wanted to divide all the appetizers, including the four orders of chips. Wait a minute - we only ordered TWO basket of chips!! When we'd tried to order a second set of baskets, we were told they were out and that's why we ordered the queso fundido. We were under the impression that the second set of baskets was complimentary because of the wait. Eventually our server agreed to waive the charges for the second set of baskets.

TWENTY MINUTES LATER she came back with our checks. Except that they weren't itemized. Each check listed ONE item in the order, and then a total cost. And the total didn't add up to the sum of the items plus tax, it was up to a few dollars more. We asked if the discrepancy was a gratuity and she said no, that they don't include gratuity on checks. She assured us multiple times that even though the checks weren't itemized, they added up to the correct totals. An order of chips ($3), jamaican jerk wings ($6), three tacos ($9) and chiles relleños ($10) cannot sum to $30.50 including a $1.75 tax. Eventually the owner was involved, and after checking on it explained that the discrepancy was a gratuity. Really? A $0.75 gratuity? Okay...

It was 10:34pm when we finished paying and left.

If the food is so fresh it takes 2 hours to serve, put a note on the menu or warn large parties when they arrive! We're never eating here again!"}
{"text":"Service here was absolutely horrible. After 15 minutes, we got up and retrieved menus ourselves, and after 20, we had to flag a server down to bring us water. The restaurant was probably about 60% full with plenty of staff and servers.

They were out of chips and several other menu items, so we couldn't order their famous salsa. Food was fine, but they brought my soup out with my meal instead of beforehand (I asked for it as a starter). Jamaican jerk sauce was good, but the consistency of the tofu wasn't good.

I will not return for a long time, except maybe for take out."}
{"text":"I feel like not so many people know about this place, and they need to! I loved everything about this place. The laid back Caribbean/Mexican feel, with sugar skulls and paintings done by local artists, and the food was great! The queso fundido with red AND green chorizo was AWESOME, I love queso fundido ;) also had pork and beef tacos, we all had different tacos and everything was great!"}
{"text":"It's okay. I've been there twice and neither time left me all that impressed. The tacos were eh. The atmosphere was pretty cool. I wanted to like this place but it was just okay. But I can say that the service was good both times."}
{"text":"Really slow service for very small portions of food. I had to ask the wait staff for more utensils because there weren't enough for our party. Also just no napkins, had to ask for that as well after waiting awhile for the waitress to show up. The food tasted alright but nothing great. Later that night and all through the next morning was crippling stomach pain."}
{"text":"There were only 2 other occupied tables when I walked in for dinner on a weeknight. It was pretty quiet but there was some Bob Marley & the Wailers music playing the whole time. 

This was my first time here and I ordered the avocado fries, which were good, but they didn't blow me away. I also noticed that a lot of the items on the menu say they are spicy but I got the shrimp fajitas, which were marked spicy, and there wasn't a kick to it at all. But that is in no way a complaint. They were actually very very good and came in such a large portion. I was extremely satisfied!

There is no parking lot for this location, so we parked on the street, which I believe is free after 6 in that area (but don't quote me on that!)"}
{"text":"I agree with the other yelpers who have reviewed this place - yay for another taco shop in Pittsburgh. This place is great.  Affordable and FAST.  We have recently visited some of the other new taco shops in Pittsburgh and waited 45 minutes for lunch. Casa Rasta was speedy.  We tried 3 tacos and a torta. I am not normally a fan of vegetarian sausage but the soyrizo here was amazing.  Definitely worth a stop."}
{"text":"The GUACAMOLE. Get it. So yummy with the yucca chips. For dinner, I had the delicious jumbalaya in all of its spicy two-different-kinds-of-chorizo goodness. The service is super friendly. The atmosphere is relaxed and comfortable - definitely a quaint spot I'll be returning to frequently. A tad on the pricey side, but well worth it in my opinion. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Hands down this is the BEST Mexican fusion restaurant in the Pittsburgh area. Located just off the trolley tracks in Beechview, this little storefront venue is an amazing find. Antonio and crew keep it simple but savory. Where else can you get burritos with savory Jerk Chicken? Or tostadas with homemade chorizo and mango? The prices are amazingly inexpensive... and it's BYO... so a meal will not break the bank if the fiscal cliff has put a dent in your finances. If you are in the South Hills, or want to make a little trip just off of Banksville Road: try this gem!"}
{"text":"Casa Rasta has very good food but I'm still not convinced that it will be part of my regular restaurant rotation.  If you're hungry for decent Mexican/Caribbean fare, by all means go.  The food won't disappoint you and our waitress was wonderful -- very engaging but not over the top and annoying.  Our wait wasn't excessive but it was a bit trying, and it was also freezing -- we had to move tables.   CR has also landed a new location, perhaps after they work out some of the kinks, they can focus on the decor, which still has remnants of the previous restaurant Lunardis.  That aside, food was great -- I had a chorizo burrito, my husband had a goat burrito and my son had jerk chicken wings.  For dessert, we had a chocolate cheesecake that was far less cheesecakey than it was mousse-like.  Delicious."}
{"text":"Quickly little place with simple, fresh food. Great prices and convenient location."}
{"text":"Went here on a recommendation and was not disappointed. Ate the Red Stripe Ribs, they fell off the bone and was delicious to the last bite. Service, atmosphere and food were tops. I can pass along the - Highly recommend. BYOB."}
{"text":"We recently met a couple friends for dinner at Casa Rasta on a Friday night. We did not make reservations so we decided to eat outside rather than at the bar (which is now used for seating only as they are BYOB). Everything was going well until it started to rain and we had to attempt to sit a toddler with us at the bar. Make reservations.
We started with the chips and guac. I loved that the guac had a nice heat/kick to it. Most guac tends to be bland. I also tried the avocado fries but they were not for me. The creaminess of fried avocado was not a pleasant texture for me though, others at the table liked it. For my entree, I got the flautas. Spicy chicken and onions wrapped in crispy corn shells topped with more guac and onions. The meal came with a side if rice and beans. Overall, I enjoyed the meal. The flautas were tasty but very small for an entree. Other entrees ordered at our table were much larger and contained more meat/fish."}
{"text":"Damn shame, this place. I had been to the location in Beechview a couple of times and loved it, but the widely reported startup problems here persist. Service was clumsy and slow. 

One of us had tacos, liked the pulled pork but didn't like the jerk chicken as much. 

One of us ordered shrimp burrito; it arrived cold, and was dry and entirely unappealing. 

I ordered oxtails, clearly pulled from the refrigerator and quickly reheated, gristly and not as flavorful as I expected, served with rice in a nondescript tomato sauce along with a couple of slices of good fried plantain. I'm just hoping I don't get sick. 

Maybe there is a Peter Principle operating here. Prospects of these folks succeeding in Eastside as they did in Beechview, where the operation was less ambitious, seem low."}
{"text":"This new location is wonderful and you can BYOB and they have reggae music periodically.
Service always good, meals are wonderful, seasoned perfectly and pretty. Truffle is amazing. Chips and salsa awesome, not poured from a jar. 

I like the adult centered atmosphere.

THey have an awesome quinoa vegan soup!!!!   I had the vegan chorizo tacos. The texture great but it needs to be seasoned more. It tasted sweet and bland.

We love coming to this place. It has good vibes and always tasty food. THe food is expertly prepared, not just thrown together like a lot of places.

THis is truly an original!!!!!!!!!!!

Small portions that really satisfy"}
{"text":"I didn't have high hopes for this place considering it's location, but if there's a vegan taco to be had, I'm going to try it. I had some sort of seitan taco and a veggie burrito combo. The taco was boring, served with just seitan, no vegetable to dress it up. The flavors were OK, but I've had way more exciting tacos. The burrito was big. That's about all you could say about it. It had stuff in it, but nothing very interesting. I was super hungry, so it was satisfying enough. The server will ask you if you want chips and salsa, say yes. It's $3 and the green is pretty good. Red was meh. The food aside, the wait staff seemed to have some serious issues. Everyone that worked there seemed to have been hired that afternoon. It was chaotic and an unnecessary amount of people were on the (tiny, tiny) dining room floor all at once. The girl \"in charge\" seemed to be about an inch away from a full blown panic attack, and there were only 6 tables. It was a bit stressful to watch.

Just a warning - If you find reggae music just as unbearable as I do, be prepared. You will hear it here, obviously. I think this place has potential. They need to tweak some menu items, hire a competent waitstaff and purchase furniture that is more than 5 inches off the ground (seriously it feels like you are on the floor). Basically, if this place was another restaurant completely, it would be good. 

It's BYOB though! And cheap! You park on the street and apparently you should make reservations on the weekends."}
{"text":"Am I missing something?

Given the excellent reviews I dined here with great expectations.  The tacos were so lack luster I thought--the chef is having an off night.  I came back the very next night to try this place again and it was WORSE!

I'm sorry, I SO wanted to like this please because I.LOVE.TACOS.  Who does not love tacos?  How can a taco possibly go wrong?  I just don't know what happened.

The tortillas are made in house, but they taste like they were deep fried and are mushy.  I had the carnitas tacos and they were completely bland.  Everything needs salt, which honestly is kind of refreshing considering most restaurants over salt every thing.  This taco was basically wet soft meat in a mushy tortilla.  Queso fresco and some ripe tomatos could have saved this taco but neither was an option.  You get meat, in a soggy tortilla, with onions on it.  There are home made salsas available but both only added heat. not flavor.

The next night I came back and tried the fajitas.  You get a pile of gristly meat over pungent red peppers.  No cheese, no guacamole, no anything but meat and peppers to put in your soggy tortilla.

I am confused by all the great reviews.  This place is right next to Davio's and the entire time I was dining here I kept thinking how much better my meal would be if I were having dinner at Davio.

The staff is very friendly, but the food...  I honestly am so confused by the good reviews.  I really want to like this place.  The food is AWFUL.

Two stars for the friendly staff."}
{"text":"Great food, atmosphere, and the employees make this little casual restaurant a sure bet! When the chicken tinga special is available, make sure to have it for its delicious! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Cool place!  Small inside, but big good flavors!  Mexican with a Caribbean twist! Had 3 different tacos on corn tortillas!  Excellent. And a chocolate truffle with some spice to it, delicious! 

I was told live band Thursday's. Brunch on Sunday. Definitely a place to keep coming back to!"}
{"text":"Considering what I read from all the reviews I thought I'd really enjoy Casa Rasta. 

On my visit I ordered the Queso Fundidos with Green Chorizo which was supposed to be \"spicy\" but it lacked spice and had no flavour definitely wasn't too impressed.

But I didn't let that stop me too much. I then went on to order the Jamaican Jerk Chicken, CItrus Marinated Pork, and the Roasted Pork Tacos. Still a little lack luster in flavour. I don't know when I think Mexican and I think Carribean cuisine i think loud bold flavours. Casa Rasta nice try but you're not doing it for me. 

Maybe I'll try Casa Rasta again but I don't think I'll be making a trip out to Beechview JUST to go to Casa Rasta."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner last night at Casa Rasta and it was extremely flavorful and a delightful experience all around. We started with an order of chips and green salsa which was perfect. The chips were fresh and the salsa had powerful but not overwhelming flavor. 

For my main course I had the Jamaican Jerk Tofu that had a nice kick to it and was served with coconut rice, pineapple, and plantains. The rice was great because it helped to balance out the jerk-ness of the tofu. My husband had the Chicken Flautas which looked great and he was able to confirm their greatness. They take care to present their plates nicely. Well done.

Keep in mind this is not traditional Mexican food - if you want that, you probably are better off elsewhere. This is a fusion restaurant with great flavors. If you're in the mood for something different, go here."}
{"text":"Awesome flavorful and original twist on Mexican food. Terrific friendly service with a feeling that you're not in Pittsburgh for a moment. With Mexican music playing and Spanish being spoken this place is a display of laid back authenticity at its best."}
{"text":"Came in for a weekday lunch, and it was mostly empty. I didn't encounter any of the service problems that others have indicated--maybe they have improved or I just got lucky. In any case, the waitress was able to seat me immediately, and throughout the meal everything was brought out or refilled in a timely manner. I ordered a \"Cuban\" torta, \"Cuban\" in quotes because it's not like a real Cuban sandwich, at least from what I've had in Florida. Nevertheless, it's a huge meal, and it contains a large amount of ham, breaded pork, sliced hot dog, and shredded veggies. The fillings were pretty good, while the bread was a bit dry. Overall an okay meal, definitely a filling one.

I was a bit dismayed with the cleanliness of the place. The benches were rather dirty; I had initially sat at one of those and later decided to move to a chair after noticing all the crumbs on the bench. At the front door there were a lot of ants and I saw that they had set up some ant baits. But really I wish they had taken care of the problem before opening the restaurant that day."}
{"text":"So can we talk about how I used to live in Beechview  a block away and this place was just a little taco place?! I had gone there a few times before... But moved away this past winter! I had no clue that it was turned into a restaurant! We liked the food then, but it is SO much better now! We started with the wings (ok... nothing too special). I had heard from several people to try the ribs.... Sweet baby jesus I was glad I did!!! They were AMAZING!!!!!! Awesome amount of spice (maybe a little too much for some people) and sweetness! I am already craving these and it's been 2 days only! We also split a couple of tacos that we both knew we liked from the past! I love the Al Pastor and my husband always gets the birria (beef) tacos. I remember from the past that the burritos were awesome too. 

After we were completely stuffed... But we STILL needed to try some dessert. The chocolate hazelnut cheesecake was awesome! I work at the Cheesecake Factory so I really didn't want to eat cheesecake.... But the waitress convinced me it didn't take like cheesecake and more like a mousse.... And it was completely worth it! 

I wish I still lived in Beechview and could go back daily... But I will definitely be making the 15 minute drive back.... Probably a lot!"}
{"text":"I have wanted to try this place ever since Munch wrote it up in the P-G.  The timing was good because they just moved into a new sit-down location a couple of doors up from the old place right on the Red Line.  

I guess the biggest surprise is that Julie and I ate, and ate pretty well, for under $20 (including tip).  Our waiter, Sam, with his waiter in training, Manuel did a pretty good job serving us.  Sam spent some time explaining the entire menu to us.  I had brought beer and they brought out a frosted mug for me.  

I tend to like spicy; so I ordered Sam's recommended spicy dishes.  Whether you order a taco, tostada, burrito or quesadilla, you can order it with the different meat combos that they serve.  I ordered 3 soft corn tacos.  The tortillas seemed homemade-with a real strong corn flavor.  I ordered one with pulled pork, one with shrimp diablo and one with poblano chilis and potatoes.  Julie ordered a quesadilla with beef in mole sauce and a tostada with jamaican jerk chicken.  

Each taco I ate was spiecier than the last.  I usually like spicy; but this was over the top for me.  My taco with pulled pork had an avocado cream sauce and pineapple mixed in.  The pineapple was the best part because it gave some sweetness to the spicy pork.  The shrimp diablo had me hiccuping, which means I had gone too far with the spicy.  The poblano chili and potato had thin strips of fresh poblano chilis and a cream sauce on top.  Notwithstanding how spicy the tacos were, they were flavorful.  I recommend you ask the waiter to tone down the spicy (something I have never done before, but will the next time I am here). 

Julie's quesadilla with mole sauce was excellent. So was her jamaican jerk chicken with pieces of mango in it. 

When we arrived the place was pretty empty; but by the time we left, the place was packed.  The place is very casual and BYOB.  Don't expect an upscale meal here.  But the food is extremely fresh and different.  A great part of the SH scene."}
{"text":"Where the hell did this come from?!  But I'm glad it came!  I happened to overhear some people talking at the coffee shop who stopped for lunch at Casa Rasta, and were raving about the tacos.  Never let it be said that eavesdropping doesn't pay off.

Having taken over the ever changing former home of Broadway Pizza, there isn't even a real sign up yet, but don't be scared off by the lack of advertising.  When you walk inside, the small dining/waiting area is completely clean and organized, if a bit plain.  You definitely know you're in for quick take out or a fast meal.  But it will be a fantastic fast meal.  The owners, the two Rastas in question, have taken the taco to wonderful heights.  

Corn taco shells are standard for the tacos, with larger flour shells for the burritos.  Their menu is small, but potent.  On this first visit, myself and my lovely eating partner had a mix and match of the Pulled Pork, Citrus Marinated Fried Pork, Chorizo, and Jamaican Jerk Chicken tacos....and they each blew our minds.  Filled with a good helping of meat, each taco comes with cilantro, onions, and a bit of shredded lettuce.  The meats are all perfectly seasoned.  My personal favorites were the Fried Pork, which had its own special pepper sauce, and the Jerk Chicken, which had a mango salsa that will blow your mind.

There are also beef, steak, and two vegetarian options.  Any of the fillings can be made in taco, tostada, burritos, tortas, or quesadillas.  The prices are good with with Tacos being $2.50 and Burritos being $6.  There's none of that price up charging for extras, as has become the norm in many places.  They also have weekend specials and homemade salsas.

Fantastic food, good prices, nice people.  It's all you could ask for.  Well, maybe a credit card machine.  But as they are still only about a week into being open, and they are already hitting on all cylinders, hitting the ATM for some cash is totally worth it."}
{"text":"There was bone in my beef burrito.  Based upon other recent reviews, this place does not live up to the hype (this was my first visit), and others keep having similar experiences.  I will not be back.  I'd rather grab some tacos in Brookline than worry about losing a tooth."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I decided to make it simple for the cook and ordered three Shrimp a la Diabla burritos for take out. Nah, that just happened that way.
The food was waiting for us after 25 minutes. They came with three containers of salsa; which we used, because we like our faces to melt off we were hoping these were spicy, and they were. 
The burrito itself was delicious, with or without the hot sauce. The price is great, the burrito is huge and now I'm ready to take a nap."}
{"text":"I originally wrote a review for this place when they were a block away from this building. 

Nothing has changed, the food is still delicious and the service is just as good. Although we haven't had a sit in lunch/dinner, only take-out they have expanded their menu. I can't wait to try more!

BYOB: $4 per bottle of wine and 50¢ per bottle of beer!

{"text":"A couple of weekends ago, Darren and I were looking at houses in Beechview and found this cute little taco shop. 

All I had was a taco with chorizo sausage, and it was soooo good. The corn tortilla was so exotic, and the meat was rich and spicy. 

Darren wanted to eat a dozen of them! But I stopped him!

The people who work here are really nice and welcoming. They even have Jarrittos Mexican Sodas which washed down my taco great."}
{"text":"I'm sad Lunardi's left, but I'm glad that Casa Rasta has a new spot. The pork burrito I had here recently was huge and delicious as was the guacamole, the salsa, and and the yucca chips (sort of like potato chips). Their food is pretty reasonable too."}
{"text":"Was not very impressed with the food specifically the pork tortillas.Serving was too slow and time taking. Not impressive."}
{"text":"After reading some of the reviews, I was a little hesitant to try Casa Rasta. But it's close to my neighborhood and I like to give all new restaurants at least one shot. I'm happy to report that my first experience there was great and I'll be sure to return. 

First off this place is BYOB, which is always good by me. The corking fee for a bottle of wine is only $4- a nice bonus. When I called to make reservations, the hostess told me that if I were to bring a bottle of liquor, she could make a pitcher margaritas for the table. (Next time!) 

We ordered chips and guacamole, as well as sriracha wings to split as an appetizer. The guacamole was really tasty, a little spicy, but still smith with nice avocado chunks. The wings were equally as good- spicy and not at all soggy. (Soggy wings are a huge turn off, IMO.) 

For dinner, we split plantains, goat curry, jerk chicken, and chicken/potato flautas between the four of us. Everything was delicious. The flautas were so flavorful and the potato mixed with chicken is a nice spin. The goat curry was good, too. It's presented as chucks of meats and rice smothered in a yellow curry sauce.  Next time we go, I'll probably try the chicken curry, just to see how it compares. And in the spirit of saving the best for last... The jerk chicken is really out of this world. There are so many spices and flavors that it tasted like quite the gourmet dish. According to our server, it's also the spiciest dish on the menu. (And I definitely believe that because my sinuses were totally clear after dipping plantains in the jerk sauce!) We didn't try dessert so I can't comment on it. 

Overall I really enjoyed the meal and I'm definitely coming to recommend Casa to my friends. Best of all, the bill was only $60, which I found a little hard to believe. For $15 per person, we got a lot of good food. 

If you're in the market for a laid back, enjoyable dinner (spicy) dinner, try Casa Rasta and bring a bottle of wine! It's also worth noting that there are some mild dishes listed on the menu, if a burning mouth isn't your thing."}
{"text":"Love this place! Tons of vegan options. Service is always nice. They are a little slow with the food but the food is worth the wait. Just don't expect to be in and out. The salsa is fantastic."}
{"text":"Reading the previous review, my wife and I tried to give it a shot for dinner. Turns out, it was a wonderful decision. We tried the Jamaican Jerk Chicken burrito with a side of Mexican rice. The chicken was very tender and flavorful, and not a bit dry. The mango salsa that came on the burrito was an excellent touch. My wife enjoyed the rice. The owners were incredibly friendly and the kitchen was immaculately clean. Definitely will be making a return trip."}
{"text":"My star rating may be a bit over exaggerating but I felt like this place had the makings of a 4 star experience.  I also was extremely hungry when I went here so most anything would have tasted wonderful.

We ordered the yucca chips and guacamole.  It would have been really great if it wasn't doused in a pound of salt.  You had to literally wipe the salt off the yucca chips.  The guac tasted salty too but I think if the yucca chips were normally salted this would have been a perfect combo because the guac tasted fresh and the chips were light and crispy.

I ordered the Jamaican Jerk Chicken taco and the Beef taco.  I had originally placed an order for the shrimp a la Diabla taco but we were told they ran out of shrimp.  I asked for a recommendation from the waiter and he mentioned that if I liked spicy food I should go with the Jamaican Jerk Chicken taco.  However after receiving both the chicken and beef taco - the beef definitely packed some heat while the Jamaican Jerk wasn't as sizzling as he suggested. 

Also the chicken did not look like chicken, it looked like beef but didn't have a strong beef flavor so I was utterly confused by what I was putting in to my mouth trying to discern the mystery meat.  They may have used dark chicken meat or it was saturated in some colored flavoring that made it unidentifiable to the naked eye and unsophisticated palette.  In any event, this wasn't  the star of the show.  I would highly recommend the Beef (Carne de Birria) taco.  

It's byob which is a plus and the staff was very friendly and we came about 30 minutes prior to closing so there's something to be said about that.  I would definitely return and explore the menu."}
{"text":"Yay Casa Rasta! Again, still on the vegetarian kick and they have THE BEST soy-Chorizo burrito around. They also have a quaint little patio that over looks one of the steepest hills in the United States for driving. The owners are amazingly nice and their food just screams quality to me. If you are in the mood for a good burrito try Casa Rasta out!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't written a review of this place yet! We've been going since they were two doors down and the food is just as excellent as it ever way. I always order the soyrizo burrito. It is amazing. My husband likes variety so we have tried a lot of their menu and wow is it excellent."}
{"text":"This place is a little slice of heaven tucked away in Beechview--I'm not sure I would've gave this place a second glance save for the outstanding Yelp reviews. If you love Mexi-type fare, this place is certainly for you. 

I went with a friend for an early dinner on the weekend, and the place was empty when we started, but overflowing by the time we left. If you have a larger party, you should consider making a reservation. The place is also BYOB, and they have a fantastic margarita mix I highly recommend to tequila lovers. It was just the perfect mix of sweet and citrusy, and I believe you get unlimited mix with corkage fee.

The space is cute with great art, and they have outdoor seating for warmer days. They also seem to do a hearty take-out business, which I'll have to remember for those strictly sweatpants kind of days. 

We ordered the Avocado Fries to start, and they were FANTASTIC. The concept of fried avocado sounded odd, but based on recommendations, we couldn't pass them up. They were crispy but avocao-y inside, and the sauce complimented the flavor perfectly. 

We also order the Flautas half veggie and half chicken. I just kept chomping on the little taquitos. They were delicious, and a great dish to share. 

I know I need to go visit again, because I spent the majority of my meal staring/drooling at what other people ordered. The menu is large and varied, and I'll be back again soon to try more dishes out."}
{"text":"Nice staff, but long wait time for tiny portions. 

We visited on a Saturday afternoon around 5pm and even though we were the only customers when we ordered had to wait 30 minutes for our meals."}
{"text":"Just don't go.  You may think it's a good idea, but it's bad.  

I took my fiancé, mother and soon to be mother-in-law for dinner. I picked this restaurant as we were staying close in Greentree and wanted something good, but close and fairly fast.  Based on all the prior great reviews, I chose Casa Rasta. 

First, it is a very small restaurant with maybe 10 tables and a bar.  We had no reservations and there was not a table for the 4 of us.  We sat at the bar, at least the bar stools were comfy, because we were there for almost 2 hours.  

We ordered spicy black bean dip and some salsa.  Our salsa came out quickly and then 30 minutes later our black bean dip arrived.  The dip was delicious.  It had great flavor although the chips tasted stale.  

We then WAITED FOR 1 MORE HOUR AFTER COMPLETING OUR APPETIZERS FOR OUR MAIN COURSE.  We had two salads, a quesadilla, 4 steak tacos and 3 fish tacos with a side of black beans.  I could have gone to the store and made something better in less time.  Besides the salad, which was delicious, everything else was not appetizing at all.  The steak tacos were this weird breaded steak without ANY flavor, luke warm and just bad. The fish tacos were not a crisp fried breading as you were lead to believe.  Rather they tasted as they had been sitting out or someone put them in the microwave. 

Maybe if we had only waited 20 minutes for this mediocre food, I wouldn't be giving this such a poor rating.  However, the service was horrendous too!  Our waitress said when asked about the long wait, \"yeah, there are lots of orders.\" with a sorry, too bad attitude.  There was no manager/owner or anyone available to care.  No offering for comp'ed appetizers."}
{"text":"This is good new spot for Mexican or Caribbean influenced foods. The two star reviews aren't warranted, but a little constructive criticism might help. It's true the food can come out a little slow at times and maybe they need to tighten up the kitchen staff to get orders out faster. And I think the reggae music needs to play a little louder in the dining room. It should feel welcoming like an island restaurant and midday when it's low light and low music it can feel a little cold. Other than that, I think the staff is all very nice and the food is great with lots of options - curry, jerk, mole options, chorizo, vegan chorizo, shrimp, chicken, ox tail. If you want your food super fast go get Chipotle, if you want bad Mexican food go to Patron across the street. If you want to support a local restauranteur doing something fun and different and producing good results in two locations, then this is a great option."}
{"text":"I stopped by here this past Friday with my fiance, another couple and their toddler.  My fiance and I arrived at the restaurant shortly after 7 PM and walked in to see a mostly empty space.  Shortly thereafter the hostess came over to us and asked us if we had reservations.  Sadly I thought that the place was a little bigger than the maybe 5 or 6 tables that it had in it and we did not.  We were then offered the option of either sitting inside at the bar or outside.  Since we were going to have a toddler with us, we ended up choosing outside even though it was threatening to rain.  Due to us sitting outside I didn't really get to see how the dining room looked.  The bar I did get to see though and whenever you were in there it almost felt like you were in a tourist trap in Mexico.  There was some cheesy 70's overstuffed red chairs and a lot of Mexican tchotchke behind the bar.
 
Soon after we chose to sit outside the other couple made it there and had brought their own bottle of wine since Casa Rasta is BYOB.  Upon coming over to introduce herself the waitress ended up taking the bottle of wine off of the table and disappeared into the restaurant.  I don't think I have ever seen a BYOB bottle of wine disappear into the restaurant before but it ultimately didn't matter as it was returned about 5 minutes later.  At this point the other couple ended up ordering a quesadilla for their toddler and the waitress left us.  A number of minutes later she arrived back with the quesadilla and we were able to order.  The table started out by sharing an order of guacamole and also the fried avocado fries.  For my entree I was having a hard time deciding between the chicken curry and the fish tacos but my mind was made up whenever my fiance ordered the fish tacos and I noticed a little fire symbol next to the curry naming it as very spicy.  The guacamole came out first and ended up tasting rather good.  It had a slight spice at the end that gave it more depth than your normal guacamole and tasted good on what seemed to me to be homemade tortilla chips.  Whenever we had finished with the guacamole the avocado fries came out with a Isleno sauce ( it seemed like a tropical marina?).  Even though the fries didn't have too much flavor to them I ended up enjoying the textural components of as the outside was crunchy while the avocado inside was soft.  Dipping them into the Isleno sauce helped to get them some extra flavor as well although it wasn't the best combination I have ever had.  Next up were our entrees and my Jamaican jerk curry came with coconut rice and pickled onions.  Wow, what a let down it was as my entree was very bland.  I literally could not detect even the tiniest bit of heat in my Jamaican jerk curry.  I guess my idea of Jamaican Jerk and Casa Rasta's is quite different as mine normally involves scotch bonnets or haberneros.  The pickled onions also seemed to lack the bite of being properly pickled which is a shame as I loved pickled vegetables.  Other than being bland my meal ended up being ok as everything was cooked nicely.  The curry sauce on the chicken kept it moist and it went well with the coconut rice.  My fiance was also nice enough to give me one of her fish tacos and after eating that I knew that I had chosen poorly on my entree as the beer battered fish was good.  As our table was coming close to finishing our meals the weather took a turn for the worse and we ended up heading inside to finish off our meals at the bar.  By this time there was only one empty table in the restaurant.  We eventually made it out of there but not before quite a bit of a wait for our checks and then again while paying them.  As a matter of a fact the service the whole night was pretty slow and blasé.  It seemed to take entirely too long to get our meals ordered and the food to come out in addition to the fact that my water glass was empty from before we finished our appetizers to the end of the meal.
 
The bottom line for me is that I might head back to Casa Rasta in the future.  While the service was not very good the food had some potential but I would love to see my dish have some heat especially it is marked as very spicy."}
{"text":"Awesome service,  fantastic citrus marinated pork burrito,  and the atmosphere was soooo chill!"}
{"text":"Always delicious food. From lunch to dinner the quality never wavers. If it were possible I'd give it six stars if they acquired a liquor license."}
{"text":"Whoever is running this now is doing a major disservice to the Las Palmas brand. I love Las Palmas grocery stores; the restaurant is interminable.  Over an hour wait for our uninspired meals.  The wait staff was apologizing for the delay.  The manager gave us a 20% discount without talking to us.  What, you don't want to face your customers??? Giving my group of 6 a $12 discount don't do diddly.  The guacamole was good, the burritos starchy and the posole a disappointment.  Until there are a dozen or so positive reviews, stay away."}
{"text":"I had very high hopes for this one: 500+ reviews and 95% likes is no easy task. (Urban Spoon)
This restaurant has now moved to Highland Ave in East Liberty.
First, the service was very good. Our server was a bit shy and did not appear to be really experienced, but that was perfectly fine by me: she was very sweet and attentive.
The food pretty much sucked. The tortilla chips were very inauthentic and store bought tasting. It seemed like they just dumped them out of a bag. The salsa was okay. My jerk chicken burrito was okay but not all that exciting. The presentation left a bit to be desired: it was on a tiny plate with nothing on the side or on top or anything. More importantly, my husband had to send back his goat entree because it was very cold in the center, as if it had been frozen. When he got it the second time, it was hot, but didn't have the same spice as before and suddenly had a side of plantains but way less sauce than before. In the end, it was okay, but showed that there isn't really consistency in the kitchen.
Keep your front of house people (although you probably didn't need FIVE people standing around...) but the kitchen needs to get their act together."}
{"text":"I have been going here since it was two doors down, with hardly any seating. From day one, the food has been fresh and delicious.

At the old location I had always gotten a chorizo and pulled pork quesadilla, washed down with a lime jarrito's. It was xtremely satisfying and also very inexpensive. 

Since they have moved, I have tried to be a little bit more daring with my choices. The last time I was there I had both the chiles en nogada and the avocado fries. The chiles en nogada has been, hands down, the best item I have had on the menu. The peppers are oozing with cheese. The cream sauce with goat cheese and pomegranate seeds take the dish to an entirely new level.

The avocado fries tasted fresh and were nice and crisp. The isleno sauce that they come with isn't quite a sauce (it is more of a tapanade), but it is still delicious.

I highly reccomend going to Casa Rasta and enjoying a delicious blend of traditional Mexican flavors with a Caribean flare."}
{"text":"Went in during lunchtime on Saturday and the place was nearly empty. It took a minute to get service, but once we did, things went great. We had plentiful refills on our water, a friendly server, and delicious food.

The soyrizo taco I had was fantastic -- good news for vegetarian & vegan diners. (Lots of other options there, too). Great tortillas (tasted fresh)!

My dining partner had the Carribean tofu and was also impressed. It came with plantains and mango slices. Not too many places in Pittsburgh you can get plantains.

I'm definitely planning to return and see how they do when handling more tables!"}
{"text":"I might have finally found the Mexican Restaurant I was looking for in Pittsburgh.  I love tacos, and prior to visiting Casa Rasta I only loved Reyna's and the Pittsburgh Taco Truck's tacos.  Well, I have to add a third taquería to this list, and one that has inside seating!

We started with the avocado fries and the beef tongue tips, both were fantastic.  I easily could have just had two more orders of the avocado fries and went home happy.  However, I came for tacos and tacos I would have.  I had 3 tacos: the Steak, Citrus Marinated Pork, and the Jerk Chicken.  All were fantastic.  There was a lot of meat on each taco, and each was flavored perfectly.  However, why skimp on the avocado cream sauce on the Steak Taco?  That should be on every taco ever, end of story.  

I didn't plan on having dessert, but when I hear homemade nutella cheesecake, I am powerless.  It was even better than it sounds.  Just get it."}
{"text":"We walked here on a whim, when another nearby restaurant was all booked up. I'm so glad that we did! The food was incredible! The yuca chips and guac were great, as was their vegan soup. But the real star of the show for me was their VEGAN JAMBALAYA! Oh. My. God. So good! I left completely satiated. If you've read my other reviews, you know I have a soft spot in my heart for restaurants that go out of their way to take care of the vegans (as I am one!) and this place totally does, items are clearly marked on the menu! Love that! I wish Casa Rasta was closer to where I lived, I would seriously be here ALL the time! Absolutely delish!"}
{"text":"Just an updated rating.. I think I rushed to a 5 star before. While the Tortas are still excellent and love the avocado fries with that sauce.. However I had chicken fajitas yesterday and I wouldn't get them again. Not a lot of flavor and the chicken just wasn't prepared the way I would like it."}
{"text":"Casa Rasta is a great addition to the neighborhood!  And how sad that one earlier reviewer noted he went because there was a line out the door from Chipotle in the shopping center across the street.  Those poor souls are lining up at the wrong place if they are seeking high quality Mexican (and Mexican inspired, Caribbean) food at highly affordable prices.  As a native Californian who has lived in Mexico and tasted lots of Mexican, Tex Mex, Cal Mex food over the years, this is one of those restaurants to cherish because it dares to depart from the tired formulas of so many Mexican restaurants in the US.

My wife, our adult son, and I shared a marvelous meal at Casa Rasta last night.  We tasted several of the tacos--Beef Birria, (braised in chocolate/chili sauce), Cochinita Pibil, Chorizo, Jerk Chicken.   All were excellent, flavorful and tender,  but the Jerk Chicken was our collective favorite.   Be forewarned, the servings of meat atop the tortillas are quite generous--two of these $4 tacos are plenty for a very satisfying meal.  There are no other included accompaniments as earlier reviewers noted, but you can order rice and black beans, guacamole, chips and tasty red or green salsa, as well as mango,and avocado cream--all for $3 or less.

Our son ordered the curried goat (with Caribbean jerk seasonings) with coconut rice which we all tasted and agreed was marvelous.  I am eager now to try some of the other Caribbean entrees.

The restaurant is BYOB, and again, where else can you find a corkage fee of $4 for three people sharing a bottle of wine?

Service is casual and friendly, perhaps not the polish you would seek in a more formal restaurant, but this is an oasis of the relaxed Caribbean in 25 degree East Liberty!  As a new resident of rapidly changing, newly upscale East Liberty, I hope that gems like Casa Rasta receive the patronage they deserve."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and seemed to have had a completely different experience each time so I'm going to round it out to 3 starts from what would have been a 4-5 star experience and a 2-3 star experience I'll combine in this one review.

So the first time I went was soon after they opened and I had the chile rellenos which were AMAZING, and I think the best chile rellenos I have ever had.  The goat cheese and pomegranate seeds were really a fantastic touch.  The service was also excellent and we enjoyed the salsa and cheese dip as appetizers.

The 2nd time I went was today, several months after my first experience.  I decided to try the tacos this time so I got a beef taco that the menu described came with some type of chili chocolate sauce which sounded intriguing.  I also got the quinoa cilantro plantain soup which sounded really unique.  However, I was disappointed in both.  The beef taco tasted dry and flavorless like it really needed something else, and I couldn't even really taste any of the special chocolate chili sauce I was so excited about.  It felt like it needed some kind of slaw or veggie or cheese or something, as the only garnish I could see was the cilantro (and I guess onion in there somewhere but I could barely taste it).  The quinoa soup was quite bland and uninteresting even though it contained interesting ingredients.  My friend ordered the chorizo verde tacos and it came out as two plain ground beef tacos.  She went to report the error and they tried to argue with her at first then finally admitted that they were out of the chorizo verde!  Ridiculous! They finally brought her regular chorizo which they should've offered the first time.  My other friend with the jerk taco did enjoy it though and that one looked like it had more to it with the mango slices and other accoutrements.  Also, the service this time was just terrible despite the restaurant only having 2 other tables seated at the time.  It took forever for us to place our order, the food took quite awhile to come, and the server never checked on us and we had to find her a couple of times (such as to fix the error).  We also had chips, salsa and guac that were just ok, nothing that tasted super fresh or amazing and the portions were small of the salsa and guac (and the salsa was not free like most places offer). I was definitely disappointed after my first visit.

It is BYOB so that's kind of disappointing to have no drink options but they said they would make margaritas if you bring the tequila but I think that was limited to a specific day of the week.  It wasn't completely clear.  The decor is really cute with traditional art, very colorful and lively, and a faux thatched roof look along the walls.

I noticed other reviews on here talking about them having an issue with being out of things.  This time they were only out of the pulled pork, but it was a key ingredient of multiple dishes.  One reviewer noted that they were out of so many things because of a busy night the prior night, including key things like guacamole.  If you are a restaurant and you run out of a key app like guacamole, go to the freaking grocery store and buy some more avocados and make some more asap!  Even chipotle does this and that's fast food.  They really need to get it together or they won't last long."}
{"text":"Maybe only two stars.  Service as VERY slow.  Fried avocado not really much flavor.  Jerk chicken burrito very dry and tasteless. BUT, the ox tail was excellent.  And desserts, truffles and plantains, were very good.  BUT, how can a restaurant not have a coffee maker that works fast enough to have coffee with dessert,that itself took a long time to come out.  At least she recognized how slow things were and compted us the appetizers.  So a mix of good and bad, plus as another reviewer wrote, they are very often out of items.  And, it is very loud."}
{"text":"Casa Rasta has really established itself as a destination restaurant with the 'adjusted' location. The new sit down restaurant w/ bar allows folks from other neighborhoods to venture into Beechview for fresh Jamican inspired menu items that any lover of Mexican will be celebrating! The ownership is friendly + clearly committed to providing quality ingredients w/ a simple presentation. The vegetarian selections are substantial and will hopefully expand. I am tempted to give them a bad review so this South Hills Pittsburgh gem stays a secret, but the owners deserve explosive success! So I reluctantly...selflessly say go check it out.

And I have to share Rachel's enthusiasm about the fact they accept cards!!! They get that it's the 21st century unlike many other PGH establishments that still only accept a sack of grain or first borns."}
{"text":"I went there the other night. Plusses: BYOB and very tasty food. Minuses: relatively inattentive service, overpriced entrees--I would've paid $10-$12 for the curried goat as oppose to the $15, and not the greatest of atmospheres. I'd be happy to go back and try out one of their less pricey dishes like a burrito, and I think with a group of friends it would really fun."}
{"text":"I wanted desperately to love this little place.  The vibe is awesome, the menu is cool and I love the cuisine.  Here's the thing, nothing was aok besides the beans.  The black beans were good.

I ordered the jerk chicken taco and the cochinita pibil pulled pork taco.  They came with a side of green and red salsa.  Nothing was aok about any of this.  The jerk chicken was kind of grey and didn't have any jerk flavors, it was topped by unripened mango.  It was supposed to be a fresh mango salsa I guess but the flavors didn't mesh and it was just awful.  I tried it with the salsas but couldn't recommend either of these insipid and flavorless imposters.  Were they sitting around too long and did everything need salt?  There was too much wrong with all of it to sort it out.

The pork was ok, there wasn't enough of it.  Neither salsa really complimented it.  It was swallowed by the flavorful double corn tortilla that housed both tacos.  These were obviously made locally and fresh but were heavier than I am used to.

I can't recommend eating here and I will not be back.  Can I go back to Chicago now?  Mexico City downtown was the bomb and I wish they hadn't closed because this was the real deal.  Even if this isn't supposed to be authentic, they still need someone who understands food preparation and this particular cuisine.  Only my warm heart kept me from hitting the 1 star key."}
{"text":"Go to las palmas in Brookline instead.  Better tasting and food doesn't take forever to be served."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food here when they only had a few little tables outside under an umbrella. They moved a few doors down and are now even more awesome. Byob (by the bottle for beer so treat yourself to a nice 22oz to bring in), salsas are great, chorizo - I usually order 3-5 tacos/quesadillas/burritos (mix them up) with all different flavors. Breakfast on the weekends is also incredible. My brother from California got their Goat and loved it. This place is legit"}
{"text":"We went for dinner- it was crazy crowded- the service was mediocre, the noise was over the top loud, and the food was okay. Don't think that we'd go back."}
{"text":"Consistently great! Vegetarians, ask for a burrito with BOTH soyrizo AND Poblano and potatoes. OMG!"}
{"text":"What WAS Casa Rasta is no more. New menu, new management, few to none vegetarian options. Why, restaurant gods, WHY? It's a dark day for PGH foodies."}
{"text":"We dropped by last week to see what Casa Rasta is all about. Having read tons of rave reviews about their previous location, I was very excited to see that they had moved close-by.

My wife and I had an unexpected afternoon off, without the kids. I pulled out my phone, and consulted it for lunch suggestions. To my surprise, I saw that Casa Rasta had moved nearby, and we decided to check it out. 

We rolled in for a late lunch and found the place to be quite empty - which was somewhat shocking. How could such a fabled place be empty? I admit we were a little worried... There was only one other table occupied there, but they seemed to be enjoying it, so we stayed.

From the time we sat down at our table, to the time our orders were taken, it was at least 15-20 minutes. The waiter was friendly enough, but it just seemed like things were off at the restaurant. Not that I'm always in a hurry, but it would have been nice to get the ball rolling early with some drinks and an appetizer while we looked through the menu. Well, that didn't happen either. When we did get the chips and guacamole, they really did seem like Trader Joe's midlevel stuff. Would have been nice to have warm, salty and thin tortilla chips and guacamole that was freshly made table side, especially since the restaurant isn't too busy.

We ordered 4 tacos to share. They do offer a broad variety of different flavor options... but... they pretty much all tasted the same. The best ones were the jamaican jerk and conchinita pibil. The seasoning was off, and everything was actually rather bland. The corn tortillas for the soft tacos were decent, and held up well to the fillings.

I guess it's hard to move away from your original spot and end up right next to a tex-mex place across the street. I would have liked to taste more \"fusion\" between Caribbean and Mexican food, concentrating on really awesome new ideas, and tighten things up. I'm always looking for that next innovative spot which beckons my taste buds, but it has to be good, and it can't merely live off past successes.

There are lots of \"competitors\" in this niche, with Patron just across the street and Smoke opening up soon in Lawrenceville - I hope Casa Rasta was just having an off day early during their soft opening days, and I wish them well. We will wait a few months to come back and see how things have changed, once they have had time to settle in."}
{"text":"Another business across the street that I really wanted to like. The service was friendly.  They even had live music the night we went. But the food.

We had both kinds of salsa. It was okay. Chips were a little greasy but better than being from a bag.  Whatever.  I ordered some kind of taquitos after having no idea what the server was telling me.  Unfortunately, they were just not good. I'm a picky eater, but even +1 had to agree with me.  It had a smokey flavor in the way that your pap's scotch or dog bacon would.. as if they just poured it on. The rice and beans were okay, but no better if I microwaved them myself.
I don't even remember what +1 ate, so it couldn't have been great. We even had churros for dessert (told you I was really trying here!); good, but undercooked. 

After the rave reviews of the Beechview location, you'd think this would do just as well.  I'm hoping this might be that new restaurant trouble, but for now, I'd avoid it."}
{"text":"I heard some great things about this place, so I had high expectations.  I wouldn't say my experience was a \"normal\" one, since we had a party of 12.  Please, keep that in mind when reading this review. I'm sure if you go with two people it would be completely different.  

Our server was friendly and attentive.  My only gripe was how long it took to get our food, and it wasn't exactly warm when we finally received it.  The flavors were great, though.  My favorite was the Al Pastor.  I also opted for a Chorizo Verde taco, just because I've never seen green Chorizo until last night!  

I think it's pretty cool that you can BYOB liquor and they make margs and mojitos for you.  I personally didn't try one, but the rest of the table said they were awesome.  

Overall, this is a great place for the neighborhood, but I'm just not sure if I'd travel from the northeast side of the city to come back."}
{"text":"I don't like giving low star reviews but i'm sorry my experience here was very poor. The two stars are for the food but i would give five for the environment and decorations.

When we first came in it was pretty crowded even for a wednesday night at 7:30. They had 2 or 3 open tables but they were too close to other people so we sat at the bar. There was no sign saying please wait to be seated or seat yourself and it appeared that the host was also the waiter and maybe even the cook. Once we sat at the bar a woman greeted us and provided us with menu and asked us what we would like to drink. I asked for a margarita and she said \"do you have tequila.\" i didn't understand the question seeing that this was a bar and tequila is what is served in a margarita. Then she says that they don't have a liquor license but if i had brought my own they could prepare one for me. I was completely caught off guard especially since they have bar glasses that hang above their drink station and a whole rack of what are now empty wine bottles. Very misleading..BYOB is cool but don't have a bar look exactly like a bar then tell me you don't serve alcohol, what a rip! They even had one of those rubber drink mats that said Patron tequila on it so what the hell?? 

Any who, I asked for a virgin margarita that she said she could make and of course after 30 minutes she must have forgot because it never arrived at the table. I decided to just go with a water and one of the bottled mexican sodas, Jarritos. We ordered the avocado fries which was $8 so I assumed we would receive plenty. When the plate arrived it was a measly 6 slices of avocado with salsa evenly placed around a plate on a bed of lettuce. (see photo) I was like WTH is this. $8 for these little slices, It had to be only half of an actual avocado and the fact that i was splitting it with my sister made it even worse. After the app we looked over the menu which appeared to have alot of good choices. I chose the potato flautas and my sister order the curry goat.

Each meal came with rice and beans, for mine it was mexican rice and hers was coconut rice. We waited about 15 minutes for our food to arrive and when it finally did boy did it look dry! The rice on both our plates was not moist at all and looked like it had been sitting wayyyy too long on the plate. My dish said it came with sour cream and lettuce which were both missing. I asked for the cream but she didn't even notice that the lettuce was missing. Before she brought my food she told me that they had run out of potato flautas so i said chicken was ok. Expecting chicken in my meal i bit into it and discovered that it was potato. I find it strange that you don't know what dish your serving your customers. The flautas were premade not in the store but probably from a box and they tossed large pieces of shredded cheese on top of the flautas which only partially melted so it just peeled off like dried elmers glue. Thy shell was way to thick and there was almost no potato inside. The beans were flavorless like they came straight out of the can and were just heated. The rice was ok but it also tasted like it came out of a box and had been sitting wayyyy too long. 

My sisters meal was nothing to rave about either. She ordered the curry goat which once it came to her table was very dry with no curry on it whatsoever. When you think of curry you think of a thai place that makes it like a sauce for your rice. I've had plenty of caribbean food and this curry was not what real curry was supposed to be. they should have said curry flavored instead of curry goat. When she asked for more  sauce the waitress went to the kitchen and then returned saying that the curry is prepared with the dish so that there was no extra sauce on the side. WHAT??? How do you not have extra curry when it is essentially a sauce. I mean really people, it was like pulled pork without the BBQ sauce. (see pic) Her rice was dry and flavorless as well. Coconut rice is supposed to be sweet and a lil saucy but this stuff was like steamed white rice you get at a chinese spot. The only thing we ended up enjoying was the guacamole because it was very thick, creamy and had a little spice to it. Other than that all the rest of the food wasn't even worth my taste buds time.

My hubby came late and ordered a burrito with marinated pork. they brought out the burrito but with no sauce. He opened it up to see what was inside and it was 90 percent rice and beans and a few spoons of pork shreds. It tasted alot better than our meal but the fact that it came out dry AGAIN just left me shaking my head. After we finished our meal I was ready to pay and go. Unfortunately my hubby was talked in to ordering dessert. I protested but he couldn't resist. he ordered the churros and my sis got one of their truffles. The churros looked great when they came out but they were overcooked. the truffles were nothing to rave about either. 

Everything was DRY DRY DRY..I won't be going back!"}
{"text":"I finally got my husband to try Casa Rasta for dinner last weekend. I was so excited! That didn't last long. He really liked his $10 carnitas torta but my beef tacos ($4 each) looked and tasted like the meat had been sitting out on the counter all day long. Dry and unappetizing, to say the least. My husband may have liked his sandwich, but the meat had the same problem, dried out to the point of being crunchy on the edge (unintentional crunchiness for this dish). My tacos looked so lonely and naked sitting on the plate all curled up at the edges with hardly any condiments on them. I did add the complementary red and green salsas which helped enormously. At Mad Mex you get three tacos and beans and rice for $12-14 and they are so much better. We were there on a Saturday night and it was busy, so I don't understand dried out and tired food. Our server looked like he came straight from performing in High School Musical. The whole place seemed to run by high schoolers. He was nice but so awkward I thought he was performing from a script. We also had the avocado fries appetizer. I'd had this before and loved it but this time the $8 charge got me half of a very small avocado and the app was brought out with our meal. It wasn't hot, my tacos weren't hot, but oddly enough, my husband's torta was. Like everything else sat around and waited for the torta to be prepared. I loved this place when it was small and struggling. Success seems to have gone to their heads."}
{"text":"After hearing so many good things about the original Casa Rasta in Beechview but never having made it out there to try it, I was super excited that they finally opened one in East Liberty!  So excited that I had to take the opportunity to get some take-out lunch tacos the day after their opening.

I called a few minutes before I got there to put my order in, and the woman on the phone was super friendly - immediately I got a good vibe from the place. She turned out to be some kind of manager, as she was training the staff when I arrived at the restaurant to pick up my tacos.  She was bubbly and nice in real life too!

The East Liberty location is located in Abay's old space. They redid it to have a clean, modern but fun \"carribbean\" themed feel.  Among the artwork on the walls, I noticed a piece that looked like it was by Ralph Steadman (the Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas and Flying Dog bottle artist).  Definitely gave the place a hip feel.

Now, the tacos.  I went into this with high expectations, due to the hype over the Beechview location and the prices ($4 per taco).

Chorizo:  This was my least favorite taco.  I thought the flavor was relatively bland, and the way the chunks of pork were cut was definitely not my favorite (it was more chunky than pulled pork style).  Doused this one with the red hot sauce, which definitely improved the flavor.

Jamaican Jerk Chicken:  Loved the bold jerk flavors of this one, and the addition of the thin slices of mango to cut the jerk seasoning made the flavor just amazing on this one!  However, I found the chicken to be overly dry, and I thought it would have been easier to eat if the chunks were cut a little smaller.  I also thought that it was a bit light on the avocado crema, more of which would have helped alleviate the dryness of the taco.

Cochinita Pibil:  This. One. Was. Awesome.  And I'm so glad that it was, because Cochinita Pibil is one of my all-time favorite mexican flavors. This was super flavorful, but not too salty and not too spicy (you will get that habanero punch, though, so this is NOT for the faint of heart!).  I did not feel the need to add any red or green hot sauce to this one.

By the way, their red and green salsas (hot sauces) were spectacular.  They could seriously elevate any dish you get here, if you found it to be sub-par.  They are very spicy, though!  Just the way I like it.

Overall, I enjoyed these tacos.  The Chorizo and Chicken ones did not blow my socks off, but perhaps the kitchen is still working out some kinks (or perhaps I didn't order the right things).  I am looking forward to returning to try some more of their delicious sounding menu!!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my first trip to Casa Rasta.  (There will DEFINITELY be many, many more visits, this just happened to be the first.)

Our server, Kim, was warm and inviting.  I asked her about the history of the restaurant and she explained it is family owned and most of the employees are friends.  It really shows that these people know and like each other.

A  friend recommended this restaurant me when I was complaining that I usually send my food back at chains restaurants because the food doesn't taste as good as  prices would suggest.  The prices at Casa Rasta could double and it would still be worth the cost.

The dining room is small so we were advised to make reservations for weekend evenings.  The interesting artwork on the walls is from local artist and is for sale, which I liked.

I don't even know where to start with the food. I like spice, spice and more spice.  The salsas fit the bill.  The guacamole had a lot of flavor.  The beans... oh the beans... were fantastic.  I'm from the southwestern US where beans are an art form and these were as well prepared as I have ever had.  The flautas was crispy and well seasoned.  The jerk chicken wings were delicious. Even the Yucca Chips were good, although, for some reason, I expected them to be warm and they weren't.  Nothing on the menu suggested the Yucca Chips were warm, so that was just me.  They were still really good.

To sum it all up, I was delighted.  The service, the food and the prices were better than any chain in the Pittsburgh area.  The food was delicious.  I wish I had found this little gem earlier."}
{"text":"After house-hunting in the increasingly diverse neighborhood of Beechview, we were famished. Kay was sick of driving; I was sick with hunger. I recalled that a new taco joint had recently opened on Broadway Avenue and even caught a glimpse of it as we drove about. Luckily, I recalled the street number, so finding it via Kay's GPS was a cinch. 

Seeing happy locals dining underneath a canopy on a muggy, bright day made me think for a second that we had unwittingly traveled through a portal and ended up in Tijiuana! When we entered the tiny establishment and bellied up to the counter, we were met by a slender man with dreadlocks, a bandana, an accent, a calm demeanor, and somewhat artful facial hair. One could picture him fronting a hardcore or metal band in a scorching stadium atmosphere, commanding the audience to jump up and down as he barks over clustered, stuttering, downtuned riffs. 

Without having looked at the other Yelp reviews, I ended up ordering what Douglas W. ordered; the jerk chicken taco and the cochinita pibil pulled pork taco. 

Unripened mango? So that's what adorned my chicken taco. I wondered what those fruit cubes were supposed to be. Well, if that's the case, there you have my only real gripe about our lunch at Casa Rasta. On my end, the jerk chicken was not \"grey\" at all, and was supple and packed with flavors of the Caribbean. The pulled pork was equally tender and like the chicken taco, I was compelled to wolf it down, which I did. 

Kay had a taco with chorizo sausage, the excess of which fell down onto the bottom of the basket. I scooped the meat bits up like an eager jackal or other such scavenger. 

The contents of each taco were held together by what could be the most heavenly maize tortillas I've ever bitten into. Images of kindly abuelas pounding out discs of corn flour for smiling children overwhelmed my culinary imagination.

Earnestly, I could have put down at least 4 more tacos and came close to sampling more of them, their sparklingly savory nature and supremely affordable price making resistance to gluttony difficult. Nonetheless, I listened to reason (Kay) and stopped after 2. 

Casa Rasta is a wellspring of tropical fusion that will delight your palate and cause your paycheck little damage. Hopefully, we'll befriend the people who run this restaurant if we decide to settle down here. Who needs cheap, corporate fast food when Casa Rasta's in town? 4 tacos=$13. What???? Quality ethnic food, fast--that's what Casa Rasta strives for and achieves. 

P.S. The tacos were all so good that I didn't feel a need to slather them in condiments."}
{"text":"I must be candid in my discontent over the demise of Lunardi's, a fine Italian restaurant that amicably competed with their next door neighbor Davio's for 8 or 9 years. However, in a positive development, Lunardi's passing has resulted in nearby taqueria Casa Rasta finding a fancier, more spacious location, así sea.

As I patiently awaited my takeout order at the bar, I chatted with a chef and regular patron who is of Latin extraction, taking in the quirky surroundings all the while. Shrunken heads, luchadors, skulls, and depictions of various animals stared at me curiously as a hockey game raged on the tube (the Pens won a nailbiter when I was there) and reggae gently poured from stereo speakers like apple wine. I felt so cozy I came close to telling Kay to get off her ass and join me for dine-in. Alas, she wasn't havin' it. 

I took home a quartet of colossal burritos, all four of them the size of paper towel rolls, along with Yucca chips, and large orders of salsa and guacamole. Thrown in for free were a 2 small cups of tomatillo salsa verde. 

My burritos were of the Shrimp Curry and Citrus Marinated Pork persuasion, and my only fault with them was that the meat, while succulent in both cases, wasn't plentiful enough, the beans and rice playing the part of filler too dominantly. Regardless, the cilantro, avocado cream, and pineapple made the carnitas (the latter burrito) cry joyfully with audacious flavors and essences. The shrimp was simply Mexican/Thai/Indian fusion par excellence, and neither of them left me hungry even if I lamented the slight pork and seafood-pinching. 

The lovely, lumpy, suety guacamole was an avocado lover's fantasy made manifest. The guacamole's piquancy embraced me warmly instead of punishing me harshly by incapacitating my tongue and went happily with the \"graveyard ghost\" chips. Yucca: The other potato. Bag 'em up and send Herr's and Pringle's running for their livelihoods. Housemade, they left little grease on my palms, shirt, or pants. 

The red salsa was as fluid as blood yet possessed deeply pungent herbs and spices that were not for the weak. We still have most of it in our fridge (along with the green salsa) since we used up most of those nifty chips on the remaining guacamole for a midnight snack. Perhaps I should stop by again and stock up on more Yucca wafers! 

Or I could go to the IGA and get some tortilla chips. 

Nah, Casa Rasta!

I wish owner and Zack de la Rocha lookalike Antonio Fraga all the best. Dios los bendiga.

Hey, don't let me catch any 'o yinz in the South Hills goin' to Taco Bell, now. Ya hear?"}
{"text":"Went to Casa Rasta last Friday and we really enjoyed the food and the prices were very reasonable. The place wasn't very busy and they had Bob Marley playing in the background which was a bonus. The interior style was Mexican meets Caribbean and looked really nice which great Tiffany style lamps, thatched roofs and different Caribbean style pictures everywhere. 

We started out with the Sweet and Spicy Mango wings and those were my favorite. Loved the sauce that came with them and definitely recommend them to anyone. The Shrimp Curry Burrito was our next favorite because the curry taste wasn't extremely strong and added so many great elements to the dish. We also had an assortment of the tacos and all were really good. We especially enjoyed the homemade salsa that we added onto it and nothing was overly hot... at least for me. 

Casa Rasta is currently a BYOB establishment so make sure you go prepared or be satisfied with a regular beverage."}
{"text":"Yay, another good Mexican taco shop!

Small place with 2 table and 2 chairs at a counter.  sauces and sodas lined up at the counter so you can see what is available.   The service was friendly and they filled us in our some of the offerings and info on the owner/chef.  Found out it was the wife of the owner/chef, so it is a family affair.  She said, \"they have some specials on weekends including some Caribbean items\". 

Corn taco shells are delicious had about 6 options and we choose the Carnitas and the Jamaican Jerk.  Very good tacos filled with a large portion of meat, cilantro, onions, cheese, lettuce and they bring out 3 different types of salsa to add to your taco.  

Jarritos Mexican soda is also available."}
{"text":"Really!  What happened?
Also, what is your name, Really!
The sign on the side of the building says 
Las Palmas.
The menu which has taken all the tacos off, says Las Palmas : Casta Rasta.

Called at 4, 5, 5:30, 6 to see if still open...No Answer just a recording to leave a message.

There were a couple of empty tables when we arrived and one large table that was reserved.  All tables filled up later because of a large group that arrived later.  The menu has some interesting items but we decided to just have a burrito - I had the Carnitas.  It was not very good.  Did not have the flavor of Carnitas or taste like the Carnitas that use to come out of Casa Rasta. SWMBO had the Jamaican Jerk and it had big chunks of chicken and tasted like my pork burrito.

Our waitress was OK and able to answer some questions, but was the only waitress.  The Chef delivered our meals, he is the same Chef that was at Casa Rasta."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite restaurant. I have been going to this restaurant about twice a month for the past year because it is my favorite. I love the wide variety of choices for vegetarians and picky eaters (like me!). 

I love the funky and eclectic art and feel too. Every time I am there, the tables are rearranged and there are new art pieces on the wall. I love the cozy feel because I am from the neighborhood and see such great potential for more places like this. I also recommend trying their specialty items. You can't go wrong with frog legs and chips and green salsa. 

Unfortunately, I have noticed that the prices of the food have been increasing, while the portions are decreasing. I understand that it's business, but the quality in food (though still my favorite) hasn't been on point the past couple of times. The chicken jerk has been fatty, the mango unripe, and a few other issues. 

Hopefully business booms and things improve because this is my favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"Everything about my meal was great. From the rice to the beans to the meat, the attention to detail is perfect. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Alas someone felt the need to tinker with what was a near perfect establishment. The awesome tacos are no more--no jerk chicken taco, no curry shrimp taco, no shrimp diablo taco,no chorizo taco, .....you get the picture.

This place is still above average, but it is more of a dinner sized, and priced, entree menu now. 

Bummer."}
{"text":"Without reading much of the previous reviews, we had an evening planned at the Turkish Cultural Center for a free Turkish film, and did a general scan for something interesting to eat in the neighborhood, and Casa Rasta caught our attention. I did glance through the reviews, and saw that there was quite a mixed bag, but we thought oh well, what the heck, let's decide for ourselves.

Mexarribean? 

So the plan was to meet at 5:00 pm, and two of us got there just a few minutes before, still waiting on the third. We were greeted at the door by a very friendly Woody Allen-ish boy in a tie-dye t-shirt, who seated us just inside.  We checked out the menu, which look quite intriguingly enticing, and our server came over to take a drink order, and possibly encourage an appetizer.

Now I see several reviews whining about bad service, and I have to say, I guess this was our lucky day...because the stunning young gal that took care of us was incredibly friendly and helpful. She was pretty, polished, helpful, well spoken, and FAR from the usual grunting yinzer, or angst ridden art school student. 

While waiting for our third to arrive, we ordered Yuca chips and guacamole, a Diet Coke (Yay, more Coke people) and a Ginger Beer. My friend had the ginger beer, and insisted that I try it, and I had to agree with him that it started out with a medicinal kind of blast, followed by a somewhat intense burning in the back of the throat. I stuck to my Diet Coke. Then suddenly Woody Allen shouted out my name from the bar, and said that our other friend was running behind, but would be there shortly. 

We waited for the Yuca chips, and the server came over and said that she was very sorry it was taking so long, but that they were actually in the process of starting them all from complete scratch, fresh, even to the extent of shaving the Yuca into chips as we spoke. 

Our friend actually arrived just moments before the Yuca chips, and they were TOTALLY worth the wait. Sliced VERY thin and perfectly fried, and the guacamole would only have been fresher had they made it tableside. Very flavorful guac as well, not just thrown together. 

So now it was time to place the order for the meal. David ordered a roasted pork quesadilla, Donald ordered a shrimp fajita, and I ordered a steak burrito. And shortly after we'd practically licked the guacamole bowl clean, the entrees arrived. 

Donald's eyes rolled back in his head after the first bite of shrimp, which were very nice size, and coated with the perfect amount of seasoning. He proclaimed them delish.  David moaned in delight on the first bite of the pork quesadilla, and again insisted that I try a nibble of the pork. I have to say, it was worth the moan, and a few extras. Beautiful seasoned, with a hint of coconut, good cheese, and TONS of flavor in the juicy pork. Not the usual dried out pork. This was excellent.

The steak in my burrito was juicy and nicely seasoned, and the burrito was a good meal size. My only complaint was that it didn't come topped with any kind of sauce, but our lovely server brought a couple of different bowls of salsa, one red and one green, freshly made, that I drizzled into the burrito as I munched it down to the nub. I would have liked a little more fire in my spice, but I completely understand where I am. So many Pittsburgher's cry when they simply SEE a bottle of hot sauce...put in a scotch bonnet? Not on their life. (and NO, it's NOT a hat!) So most foods here that would normally be a challenge to a spice loving tongue have been pandered down to please the pierogi tongues. 

After dinner, David opted for dessert, and was won over by the description of the home made hazelnut cheesecake, that the server told us the owner made herself. She described it as more like a mousse than a cheesecake, and she was right. It was spectabulous! My only suggestion to them on the dessert would be: COME ON! If you're going to make something THAT from-scratch scrumptious, put away that can of spray whipped cream! It's so easy to make shipped cream from scratch, and my goodness did that cake deserve that extra touch!

The place developed a very pleasant little crowd in the hour we were there, the server was always present and friendly, keeping the water and soda filled, and the dishes cleared, in addition to making genuinely helpful suggestions.

The bill for all that we ate only came to around $44, so this was really a very worthy stab in the dark new restaurant try. If we end up in that neck of the woods for another event at the Turkish Cultural Center, which I'm sure we will, Casa Rasta will be the first place we check into for dinner.

VERY pleasant experience indeed."}
{"text":"I've been to La Casa Rasta twice. Both times I've had the jerk chicken burrito. It is one of my favorite choices in the mex/Caribbean genre. What distinguishes la casa Rasta from its peers is the freshness and unique flavor to the food. I also recommend the queso dip, guacamole, and plantains. The service has also always been exceptional."}
{"text":"Really nice place, super friendly servers...they've all tried everything on the menu and the food tastes extremely authentic.  The art is always different each time I go, but very cool.  It's awesome that they promote local artists.

I haven't made it yet, but every other Thursday night they have live entertainment.  Something to look forward to when the snow stops!!!"}
{"text":"Worst experience I've had in memory.  Our party of six waited over an hour to be served while everyone around us was served.  Five of us ordered burritos and when, after numerous apologies, we finally got our food it was inedible, with either burnt rice or bones.  The waitress knew nothing about the menu and for some reason kept promising the manager was going to come speak with us, not that we ever requested it.  We were given a discount, but I didn't see how much.  I couldn't get out of there fast enough and will never return."}
{"text":"I had been here once before, and today after walking to Chipotle and seeing a line out the door, I thought I'd venture here again to give it another try, and support a local business.

Well, service both visits is OK. You kind of have to walk all the way into the restaurant to talk to somebody and get seated. While I understand that they're a small operation, I'd kind of expect that somebody gets up and comes to me when I walk in the door, not make me hunt around trying to figure out who to talk to.

This time, I got 2 tacos - both vegetarian. I do appreciate their decent number of vegetarian and vegan options on the menu. One was Soyrizo, and the other was Rajas con Papas (peppers and potatoes). Sadly, the tacos didn't come with much more than that. 

The corn tortillas were great, slightly moist, and warm - and properly doubled up for structural stability like a proper Mexican restaurant would do. The ingredients were cooked just right. But, the mouth-feel and complexity were lacking. Overall, the tacos were quite dry, which I recall being an issue in my previous visit with both dishes we got, and kind of overly simple and limited in ingredients.

I finished one taco, then asked for salsa for the soyrizo to see if it would make a difference. It certainly helped, but I don't think it was the right sauce for the taco. It could use something more - a bit more garlic, a bit more cream, perhaps some cheese (as an option, for non-vegans). I don't want it to be dripping, but I want there to be something to counter-act the dryness and blandness. I want a properly-paired salsa to come on them by default, not as me having to ask for it and picking the wrong type. I want some kick!

I made my suggestions to the server, and I'm making them here as well. I think this place has great potential, and is still way better than Patron across the street. But, it certainly has room for improvement as well."}
{"text":"A neighborhood favorite for sure. Food is awesome. A little annoyed over the newly added \"corkage fees,\" and, I would think they'd be waived of you also ordered a drink from them. (They are one of the few places to carry Jarritos!) Anyway,  the chocolate beef tacos are my favorite. Also the avocado fries. 

They allow dogs outside (for now,) which we love,  even though one of the servers made some very stereotypical and ignorant comments about our very docile pitbull once when we were eating there on the patio. Not the best for customer service. Another server ended up bringing us a water bowl. But whatever, small potatoes compared to the food.

Still, I have yet to taste a bad thing on the menu."}
{"text":"What's wrong with me!? I haven't update this review when it has so clearly earned it's way up to a five star establishment, without a doubt!

All my previous complaints... GONE!  

It's bigger.  And I don't just mean the burrito!  They've put two outdoor tents up so there's plenty of additional seating outside.  Hopefully they'll get some heat lamps in for the colder months, it'd be a shame to lose all that seating!  

The burrito... BIGGER! I inhaled a large burrito last night and was STUFFED. Could barely eat one Jamaican Jerk Wing. Jamaican Jerk Wing you say? Yep, they've added new items to their menu! And guess what? My burrito was shrimp! Exactly what I had wanted all along. They now offer a shrimp diablo and shrimp curry option.  My shrimp diablo was HOT, maybe not to the spicy food lover, but hot for the \"I like spicy food but it's hard to take\" spicy food fan. Plus, I could tell it was fresh shrimp and a good size.

And that salsa verde they serve? I could eat gallons! Still not so hot on the red salsa, but the salsa verde, a winner!

We walked in on a random Wednesday night at 7:30 and there was a line! That makes me really excited for them. They deserve the business because they serve up awesome food! Now that I live in the hood, you can bet I'll be stopping in once a week. Okay, maybe twice... who knows! All I know is that it rocks my world!

*They take credit cards!"}
{"text":"The new joint is bigger and better than ever! I cannot tell you how much I love this place. I want to shove never ending $7 citrus marinated pork burritos in my mouth! I hate to say it, but it competes with Reyna's tacos for me. Sorry kids. There might be a new burrito ruling the mean streets of Pittsburgh!

AND, now that their space is bigger, their menu is as well! Fried Avocado... may take the place of a fried pickle in my book. Delicious! Spicy gauc with yuca chips. Okay, pile on some more! They now even have bonafide entree items.

It doesn't get much better than this. But WAIT, it will... when they get their liquor license. I can imagine nights of margarita drinking on their patio (that I think they'll have down by their old location??). BYOB for now, so bring your mixers for their tasty bevvies. 

This place is dangerous for me, as it's in my hood. But at least I don't have far to roll myself home!"}
{"text":"Don't believe the lies!  It isn't closed. Las Palmas bought it and reopened it with an updated and still good menu. 

If you like Las Palmas tacos then you'll like this place too. Good flavors, good service, pretty good prices, and massive portions.

The menu is very interesting, many things for the adventurous eater, from goat curry to \"Menudo\" spicy beef tripe soup. 

Also, for the person who always orders fish tacos (and you know who you are), good news!  There are fish tacos. 

The queso chorizo appetizer is highly recommended and goes perfectly with the house made corn chips.The homemade drinks are very tasty, such as the hibiscus soda and the horchata. Not the best I've ever had, but definitely very solid latin caribbean fusion, and a easily one of Brookline's best dining options."}
{"text":"Stopped here today to give it a try and must admit the food was excellent. I ordered the vegetarian Soyrizo (fake sausage) burrito and fell in love. It was well worth the $6. It's not like the big chain restaurants where they serve you a massive sloppy burrito. It was the perfect size and easily handled. 
It's small and quaint, with some seating outside in under a canopy. The owners were a lovely couple, passionate about their food. 
Excellent."}
{"text":"You can pass on this one. This is a product of the gentrification of east liberty and should be treated as such. It's fake fake fake.
Went here for takeout with a craving for jerk chicken. I would have been much better served to drive a little farther to Impressionz on Broad street. The food was hotter than it should be to be so bland.  I ordered the jerk chicken but got the curry chicken by mistake. It was spicy but overall bland and overpriced. The portion size was also smaller than you would get elsewhere. The jambalaya was also very spicy but without real flavor. I also tried the avocado fries which could have been good but were too greasy. I didn't try any of the \"latin\" dishes but I won't go back. There is really good Jamaican food in Pittsburgh but you will have to go to the \"hood\" to get it. Don't go here for it."}
