{"text":"If you love well done burgers, then this is the place for you. Also, if you love homemade potato chips instead of fries.... Me not so much.  Don't get me wrong, the food is not bad. The five alarm burger is nicely spiced. But forgot asking for med rare or medium burgers. You're getting well done like it or not."}
{"text":"Got the pulled pork sandwich, which was delicious......fresh pulled pork on a bun that was clearly homemade that day. Also got the ribbon fries which were amazing.....crisp and perfectly seasoned. Finished it off with a flavor burst ice cream  Will definitely be going back here!"}
{"text":"Very affordable and friendly atmosphere. Got a small cone for $2 after tax. Will be back"}
{"text":"I am glad we stopped here.  We were waiting for the skating rink to open and we decided to grab a quick bite.  I ordered the Shrimp Po Boy and a side of Ribbon fries.  The Po Boy was better than I expected!  The bread was soft and fresh, the pieces of Shrimp were large and not saturated with grease.  I couldn't decide on the sauce, so I decided try both - Mango and Sriracha Mayo.  The Ribbon fries were also a big hit.  My kids loved them - more a chip than a fry.  And because I had my kids with me (yeah right) I couldn't leave without trying some ice cream.  It was creamy and good.  The sprinkles were really crunchy and different than the usual.  There were 3 picnic tables along the side of the building and they accept credit/debit cards - BONUS!   Overall, a good experience.  I would go again if in the area."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me?! Best homemade burgers and fries in town! Their homemade buns rival Mancini's. Definitely worth your time to have some awesome food. Little gem in Coraopolis if you appreciate quality. If you have room for ice cream, you won't be disappointed either."}
{"text":"This the best ice cream I have ever had. I got the chocolate softserve dipped in chocolate.  It was smooth and creamy. My date had the cookie dough milkshake.  Perfect consistency to drink. Not too thick not too thin.  We've been here a few times now and it's the same great taste every time"}
{"text":"Just had my first soft serve of the season and it was excellent as usual.  Great cream, awesome customer service.  It doesnt get better than this.  Support local!!!!!!!!!!! DLUKE"}
{"text":"Been there twice and not disappointed.  First time we had the surf & turf burger (shrimp on top of the burger) and the turkey sandwich (freshly roasted & sliced). Oh so good!    Next time it was just me and I had the Aloha burger. It was great!  Topped with a grilled pineapple & ham and just the right amount of mango sauce.   Didn't care for the BBQ cole slaw.  I personally just like the creamy Marzetti type.  I had a chance to meet the owner & he is super nice and he makes the hamburger buns himself !"}
{"text":"The mint chocolate chip shake was fresh and tasty. I got the large and it was fair for the price. It topped off the meal great after stopping at that amazing taco place across the street. The lines weren't long and the service was fast. I liked the shake and will be back to try other flavors."}
{"text":"Love love love this place!! Not only can you take a walk back to your child hood and enjoy twist cones, you can indulge in some really good homemade food. I've been here a few times, and the food never disappoints! In our last few visits, we had a cheeseburger (so good) and a footling dog with the works. (Yum) My favorite thing though is the CURLS!! These are a fun treat...cross between fries and a homemade chip. SO. GOOD. They have really yummy sundaes too. The Cracker Jack is a must try!! Gibby's is legit."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this for quite some time and I wasn't disappointed. I had the surf and turf burger and it was the first hamburger I think I have ever had that I didn't use condiments, it was delicious!!!! Ribbon fries were also great. I will be a return customer and can't wait to have the rest of the family try it."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers and amazing ribbon fries! We had the Aloha Burger, Caprese Burger, and the ribbon fries! Also had a blueberry-cheesecake milkshake and it was amazing! They're doing things right so prepare to wait a few minutes... It's 100% worth it and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We came across this place looking for a Mexican restaurant near by that wasn't what we expected.   We ordered a lot of food and considering they don't have indoor sitting or a public restroom, I will have to explain to you the reason this place deserves more than 5 stars.  We had Grilled Cheese sandwich: thick bread, perfectly crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, cheese and not too greasy.  A Cheese Burger: home made burger with a bun that seems to be from Bread Works.  A Shrimp Po'Boy: jumbo shrimp, lightly breaded and fried to perfection, with sriracha sauce, tomato and lettuce and that wonderful Bread Works bun. The fries had a light coating of old bay seasoning, perfect. And last, Vanilla Milk Shakes, made with real ice cream!  Tip: There's a bathroom at a laundromat across the street."}
{"text":"Hmmm.... how can you go wrong with an ice cream joint?  I seem to be out of kilter with other reviewers. I don't expect all that much from a sundae.  I mean it's soft serve so how can you go wrong?  Well, I ordered hot fudge and caramel on my vanilla soft serve.  I was not all that impressed with the amount of either on my sundae.  Just seemed a bit sparse on both.  Hmmpfh."}
{"text":"Totally awesome in every way.  Been there several times...Swiss mushroom burger, footlong, pulled pork, BLT....all scrumptious.  This time tried the chicken enchiladas family meal. Yummy!!  Highly recommend the family meals. Why cook when you can get a great meal made for you. We even had some left over for lunch the next day. Perfect dinner for a family.  Trying the chicken catchtore next!  And, boy do my kids love the Halloween sundaes."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  Quality food like this is NEVER available at a standard ice cream stand.  The new ownership has been a HUGE asset to Coraopolis.  I really wish this place had a sit down area inside so it could stay open all year."}
