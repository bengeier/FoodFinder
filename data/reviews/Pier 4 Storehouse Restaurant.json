{"text":"We olny stoped in for a late night drink but I thought it was really nice. I liked how it was dark and cozy, with very few people in it, though the ones who were got seated very close to eachother. I would def go back agin because  I love dark cozy places near the water and this place gave me what I love."}
{"text":"Great Seafood Experience, just a bit pricey. Calamari and Mussels were AMAZING! As for the entree, the Seafood Platter was the best consisting of delectable Shrimps, Oyster Rockerfellers, Lobster and Crab Legs. Great Service, didn't take too long for the food/drinks to arrive. The Pina Colada and Stawberry Daquri were awesome! I'll probably only come back here for a special occasion cause the bill came to $300! If only I had that much money to burn everyday!"}
{"text":"Expensive, even for the waterfront.  Not much of a draught beer selection.  Outdoor seating is nice and close to water though.  Also, the Mango salad was quite good."}
{"text":"The interior is a sight to see... and I mean that in a positive way.  The whimsical decor really does set a nice mood. The views of the lake and docks are quite lovely and make for a pleasant atmosphere.    Unfortunately the food is marginal at best.  I've eaten there twice, in the first case service was a bit slow, in the second there were numerous mistakes with our order.  There are other places on the waterfront to find good grub with similar views."}
{"text":"A very outdated restaurant, relying purely on their location for any potential of staying afloat.   We were at our table but saw other guests served before us, despite seated after us. Not a good start.   The server was less than helpful, never topped up our glasses of water despite ordering two bottles of wine, no oyster forks for the escargot or oysters, the starter plates were marginally dirty, no attention from the waitstaff, etc. Even the couple at the table beside us looked over to mentioned their experience being as poor as ours.   The rice seemed like rice-a-roni, the lobster was questionably fresh, the asparagus was cooked to a lower and much blander standard than I do at home regularly, etc.   I would venture to this restaurant if you are into investing your money into a less than average and over-priced meal."}
{"text":"went here for an early dinner around dusk. I asked to be seated in the patio, which is the only reason to go here. The patio is beautiful. It's next to the water with a marina around the corner. You can see kayak-ers paddle around the harbour and centre island. dinner entrees average around $25, and the food is okay. it's one of those places that's good to go once for the experience."}
{"text":"I've dined at many Toronto's harbourfront restaurants and it appears that in order to be a restaurant in a premium waterfront location, you must offer slow and subpar customer service.  First time at Pier 4 and I was superbly disappointed.  We were a group of 14 looking for a patio / restaurant for dinner before boarding a party cruise.  Given the gorgeous weather, we thought the patio at Pier 4 would be a great way to enjoy dinner.  At the first attempt, the hostess laughed when we told her we had 14 people and wanted patio seating and told us that it was not possible.  This was around 5:00pm on  Sat afternoon.  I had taken a walk around the patio and noticed that there were many empty tables.  So, I went back to \"understand\" why she thought that laughing at customers would be an appropriate way of handling the situation rather than asking questions such as   - \"would you be comfortable being seated at different tables or at different times\" - \"how many are you expecting at the moment\"  By the way, I want to point out that this restaurant advertises that \"groups are most welcome.  They are our specialty\" on their website.  Talk about misleading advertising???  In summary: - Expensive and mediocre food.  By mediocre I mean that the quality is no better than the average pub except expect to pay $50 more - Slow service - Rude hostess and waiters/waitresses  I think this restaurant survives because of its location and its existence really brings down the calibre of the Toronto harbourfront.  I would never come here again."}
{"text":"The patio is what drew us to this restaurant. The decor and interior left much to be desired, but on a nice sunny day the patio is a very comfortable place to be! I had the mahi mahi which was good. The tomato sauce was a little overpowering though. The service was great and overall it was a good experience, but it was quite expensive for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Nice patio, smartass service, one in three meals was reasonably fresh. Better places to eat on the lake."}
{"text":"This is a pretty crazy looking restaurant / bar, with just about every type of seafaring, pirate related and nautical bit of memorabilia you can imagine emblazoned around the entire place. It looks very much like a normal pier house from the outside, but once you step inside you feel like you're on a Disney ride. Don't get me wrong, I love this kind of stuff, but someone needs to learn about moderation because it's gotten a bit out of hand here.  We stopped in for something in between lunch and dinner, around 4 or 4:30, and we had to eat out on the front patio because apparently the back deck wasn't ready until 5, even though we could clearly see people sitting there. Whatever. It was a surprisingly nice day, so we were happy just to be out in the warm weather, as it had pretty much sucked up until that day. Our waitress was deplorably slow to take our orders and give us our bill, but we eventually got some food somewhere in between.  All 3 of us ended up order their version of a French Dip, which turned out to be ok, and included a side of fries that were actually quite good, but the portion was so small you had finished them before you even realized they were on the plate. They also give you pretty much no au jus to go with the sandwich, one of my biggest foodie pet peeves of all time. By the time you finally get some extra from the kitchen your second sandwich half is nearly cold, which is why it aggravates me so damn much. The seafood here is probably decent being right by the harbor, and I saw several signs advertising a hell of a lobster dinner deal. The regular sandwich menu is a bit pricey, and there is a minimum dollar amount each person at the table has to spend, so don't think about sharing their pizzas either."}
{"text":"No way would we return here. The atmosphere was what brought us in, decked out in boat decor.   But the wine came corked. We returned it. They brought another glass from the same bottle.   Food was mediocre and service was horrendous (terribly terribly slow even though only 4 tables filled). Not to mention the customer at the table across from us had her feet sprawled up on the second seat at her table as if she was home in her living room."}
{"text":"So disappointing!   My wife and I were visiting Toronto and took a walk by the waterfront. The patio at Pier 4 looks wonderful and cozy -that's what drew us in.  The food was horrendous! Imagine the worst nightmare on Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmares. I had the fish and chips ($17 tax not included), my wife had the chicken wings. Both came with fries. They yelled out all pick up orders over the intercom...   Everything was deep fried in old oil. The fish, which most likely came straight out of the frozen food section at Costco's, was drenched in oil... Not fresh, no passion, no seasoning, no imagination, just fast terrible food. Fries tasted like fish... The packet of Kraft tartar sauce was the best thing of my meal. My wife's chicken wings looked hard like it was fried for a week, old and totally flavorless. They tasted even worse.   We brought both dishes back, and didn't take our chances on anything the lady offered as a replacement. I got sick later that day, after only one bite of my fish. We've had theme park food that was better than this.  Please don't go there. A Ginger Ale soda and a Perier were terribly overpriced. Wish we only had that and left."}
{"text":"Went for a nice evening out with the family and ending up leaving fairly early. Upon entering the restaurant we were sent on our own mission through the long corridor to another host desk. The manager then escorted us up towards the up back part of the restaurant now where near the water view or even the other diners. The decor is tacky, with its old seafaring replicas. We ordered our beers, they did have Steamwhistle on tap. That was nice. We decided to start with the French Onion Soup, 3 orders and 1 of the Boston Clam Chowder. Now, I lived in Boston for 4 years and go back few times a year. In now way was that soup that came out anything like boston clam chowder, and for $8 a bowl I would expect more. The soups arrived and there was no steam coming off the bowls, i didn't think much of it at first, until i took a spoonful of cold salty watery soup. It was the bottom of the pot and it was weird because, the bowl itself was untouchable from heat, but the soup inside was cold. They did nothing to fix this and I was just not in the mood anymore to carry on with ordering anymore food or even finishing."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend came here with another friend a year and a half ago and had a \"okay\" experience. So we decided to come back just the two of us on a nice Saturday night during the Victoria long weekend.   Pier 4 got nice patios at the back and front of the restaurant. We got a patio seat at the back where you can have a wonderful view of the harbour (one star obtained).   DINING EXPERIENCE - We were startled by our waiter with menus and immediately he asked us \"what can I get you for drinks?\". My girlfriend told the waiter to give us a minute while water would suffice for the time being, but before  she finished her sentence he had already walked away. The waiter had a scary demeanor and was quite hostile (I actually wished I had another waiter). Another waiter came not too long afterwards with bread (3 types of bread in one basket) and butter. The waiter looked confused and placed it on our table and walked away. It was sort of a LOL moment. Then our original waiter came back to take our order. He made no eye contract with us and he was not pleasant. We ordered the Fish and Chips which came with a salad. The waiter DID NOT even asked us what kind of salad or salad dressing we wanted. After he took our order he was no where to be found, so we had to eat mystery salad.  Mmm...I have always wanted to be a sleuth...    FOOD - The food was deep fried and felt like something out of the frozen section of Loblaws or Metro. It simply didn't tasted as fresh as it can be. The tartar sauce was what SAVED the dish. Sad. Salad on the other hand was not bad for being \"mysterious\", however for a restaurant that charged me $20+ its hard to mess up a green salad. Thank God. I was happy we got alcohol so we were somewhat under minor substance to ease into this experience.   VERDICT  IMPORTANT - First thing first - ALWAYS choose their \"causal\" dining menu. Their \"real\" dining menu is simply not worth it.  DRINK SPOT - Great view, okay prices for beer, GREAT patio space DATE SPOT - If you found out your blind date looks unattractive and you rather stare off into the harbour, Pier 4 is the place for you!   Don't come to Pier 4 expecting to have great food. The view is the most you will get out the experience dining here."}
{"text":"I was in Toronto for a concert with my mother and a few girl friends, and we desperately wanted a nice lake front patio with some seafood.  Pier 4 seemed to be the only place that fit the bill, so we ventured inside.   To get to the patio you have to walk through kitschy, dank smelling pirate and ocean knickknacks.   I would not want to eat inside, it smelled terrible.  The patio was lovely, and the server although a bit strange, was polite and did his job with relative aptitude.  Why anyone wouldn't order seafood at a seafood place is just ridiculous, so of course I ordered the catch of the day - and it was delicious, not memorable, but a good bite to eat,   My friend ordered crab cakes, and they were mediocre.  Overall, the patio was exactly what I wanted, but the food was nothing special."}
