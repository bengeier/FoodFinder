{"text":"The Priddis Greens Dining Room is a great place to escape the city. First you have one of the most stress-free drives out of the city, all while staring a beautiful view of the Rockies. The dining room itself blew me away, it was completely renovated this past summer top to bottom and let's not forget it boasts one of the best views in southern Alberta. You cannot get a more picturesque view of the rocky mountains short of going to Canmore or Banff. They have a wonderful menu which features delicious inexpensive sandwiches, salads and appetizers while also offering great fine dining items at a reasonable price. We went with another couple, we had great escargot bruschetta with lamb popsicles for appetizers. For our mains, we tried the Steak Neptune (which is tenderloin topped off with crab meat and a bearnaise sauce), my wife tried the Veal Saltimbocca (which is pancetta pounded together with veal, to die for!) Our guests had a gigantic rib eye topped with vegetables and a fabulous jus, and seafood feature dish which consisted of large scallops and jumbo prawns sauteed in a white wine cream sauce. We had a bottle of Etude vintage 2005 which in my opinion is the best bottle of wine at a reasonable price. Overall the ambiance, the service and the venu was absolutely perfect for a dinner with friends from out of town or even family. I would recommend this to anyone looking to escape the hustle and bustle of the city and looking for great food. We were not aware of this, but the dining room is actually open throughout the winter even though they are a golf course which surprised us. They are open for dinner on friday, open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner on saturday and they do a sunday brunch every week throughout the year. Honestly a great place to go for good food and a great time!"}
{"text":"If your hiking in the Bragg Creek, Priddis area and you want a patio with a cool view this is your place! No need to dress up or make a reservation, everyone is welcome during the day and they have an impressive salad bar or menu options to choose from. The view of the undulating greens and the majestic mountains make this a spot I will definitely come back for a \"cold one\" in the future!"}
