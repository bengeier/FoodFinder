{"text":"Great relaxing place to meet friends and talk. Great service and decor. I ordered Voss water, cheese ball, but no wine or beer. A very nice place in a great neighborhood."}
{"text":"My first time at Dilworth Tasting Room was great! The service was superb and the waiter even let us try a wine that we didn't get on our flight. Yes, it's a wine bar that lets you try wine on a flight. Cool stuff!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place. And I still believe it has so much potential but will need to step it up to compete with other wine bars in town.  The wine: great selection, no corkage fee (awesome!), reasonable variety (at least by the bottle, by the glass seemed a little limited). Unfortunately the way the bottles are displaced makes them difficult to access, and the bottles don't have prices, so once you choose one and bring it to your table, you have to hope it's in the price range you are going for.  The food: don't come here if you don't want to eat cheese... every small plate was some kind of cheese (eggplant with goat cheese, truffle grilled cheese, charcuterie boards...)   The atmosphere: good crowd and vibe (we came on a Friday night) but quite loud and echoing inside. The outdoor patio is adorable but it was too chilly for us to brave.  The service: no problems here  Dilworth Tasting Room, please live up to your potential! Display the wine better, put the prices out, diversify your food, and work your acoustics. I'll give you time and then we'll be back!"}
{"text":"My new favorite neighborhood spot!  Beautiful atmosphere and very attentive, pleasant waitstaff.  They have a great selection of wine and beer, including a retail wine area.  So happy to have found DTR!"}
{"text":"My first experience at Dilworth Tasting Room was for my going away party. It was a perfect location for a classy happy hour for 20ish people. The outdoor area is adorable with an outdoor bar and large coy pond in the center which adds to the secret garden ambiance.  The wine menu is excellent. The flights are 3 glasses (0.5 glass pours) for $20ish. Some of the wines on the menu are over that price per glass so it's great to be able to try those. The bartender for our party was very knowledgeable and helped with selecting the wines in our flights. She was always available and friendly! (She also wore Harry Potter earrings which is a +).  All the food we had was awesome. We ordered most things on the menu (tapas). The charcuterie was one of the best I've had in awhile. The flatbreads were also great (crispy and flavorful).  If you want an intimate happy hour where you can actually hear your friends, stop by DTR!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and wonderful patio with lots of character.  Great staff and wonderful wine to choose from. Love the minimal small plate menu.  This is a perfect spot to hang out with friends or to have drinks before or after dinner!"}
{"text":"I have been waiting not so patiently for DTR to open and finally had a chance to visit earlier this week. It is fabulous! From the super friendly greeting at the door upon our arrival to the terrific and attentive service at the bar, the fab Chateau Greysac Médoc, the incredible charcuterie, beautiful décor, and fun vibe, this is exactly what I was hoping for and more! DTR is such a wonderful addition to our hood. I am so looking forward to some beautiful warm weather to hang out on the gorgeous patio again. I miss DB's but I know I will love DTR for a very long time."}
{"text":"We waited for 30 min before having to approach someone on the wait staff if it was seat yourself or if we needed to put our name down. He said we could sit where we wanted, which we did, and then we were told by a server we actually could not sit at the table we needed to put our names down. We waited an additional 20 min for them to sit us in the same spot we were at before. It took them way too long to come by and take our order. As if waiting around wasn't bad enough, the food was mediocre at best. Didn't realize a $10 salad consisted of 3 tomatoes, a few veggies, and a spring of romaine. My friend with food allergies couldn't even sub the cheese on the salad for extra veggies. Note, if you want to order the small cheese plate totaling $20 and change your mind to the medium, because you are starving, think again. Overall bad night, horrible service. But not the hot bartender in the plaid, you keep on doing what you're doing."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for the famous charcuterie and outdoor patio on Friday night and left so pleased and relaxed!!  First off, the space is super cute and quaint, tucked a street off of South Blvd. Inside area has a bunch of tables and couches. I think the piece de resistance is the outdoor garden space. There are a handful of tables, lots of foliage, and a beautiful koi pond with some really large fish in it! I felt like I wasn't even in Charlotte while we were out there.   We settled on a bottle of Barbera which was absolutely delish. The wine list was very nice and not overly expensive. I also noticed the cocktail menu and definitely want to give a few a try on our next visit. For food, we went with the 2 meats, 2 cheese charcuterie. For anyone reading this, order the charcuterie board!!! Not only is it absolutely Instagram worthy gorgeous but it is fairly large. Beyond the meats and cheeses we ordered, the board had olives, bread, a jam/spread, fruit, and nuts. For our cheeses we got the truffle flecked cows milk and the drunken goat cheese. The truffle cheese was devine. So many flavors. For meats, we got an Italian salumi for one and the other was a type of prosciutto. The meats were nicely cut and flavorful. The evening was just so relaxing enjoying the outdoors, wine, and eating slowly with great conversation. What life is all about!  Service was spot on. We spent a while talking with our server about tattoos and he even went through the trouble of writing down some places and artists he recommends, as we are chatting about possible getting tattoos. That is above and beyond!  Thank you DTR for an incredible evening. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Hands down one of my fav places to go for small plates and an excellent wine and beer selection. Staff is always helpful and it has a relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"A wine lovers dream... you can tell by the small wine  list that they were hand selected-- the Barolo we ordered was divine. We love \"cheese plates\" so this is a new favorite. Staff were knowledgeable and atmosphere was great, can't wait to dine in the outdoor garden patio on our next visit."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place due to all the hype I've read. The place was spacious and upscale feeling. The wine selection was decent and enjoyable. However I was disappointed with the food and service.   The server came around and was eager to take our wine order but we had to wait a little over 30 minutes after the wine to give our food order, after flagging down the waiter (party of 4). We often had to flag the waiter down for our water to be filled up, and we waited a while to flag down the waiter for this as well. But it could have just been that night.  The food took a little longer to prepare. Which is understandable being a semi busy evening. I had the zucchini along with other veggies, my friends ordered bruschetta and a little cheese platter. You get three to four pieces of bruschetta that's not warm and with several bites. So this place is to come if you're willing to spend money and are not hungry.   My food had very little flavor, and was not warm. It was suppose to be a hot dish when the waiter brought it he stated to be careful that it's a hot plate. Yet it was warm to cold when I ate it. When I pay for a small plate that's $12 I wish it would be more flavorful and hot, how it should be. The taste was very bland for me as well.   I'm sure the cheese platters are delicious, but there are better places in Charlotte that offer such selection with delicious food for the price, along with richer flavors and better service."}
{"text":"One of most relaxing places I've dined at. Out waitress took the time to go over the menu, help in pairings and, kept checking on our table. Loved the experience, wine/cocktail selection and, especially the cheese/charcuterie. Will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"I went to DTR last Wednesday, June 13, 2018 for the Croatian Wine Tasting.  I loved the patio, the event in general, and the snacks (read: charc & cheese boards, and sweet nutella crepes)... the wine was amazing as well!  Upon arrival, my girlfriend and I were a bit early, so we plopped down at the bar for a glass of sauv blanc while we waited for our other friends to arrive.  Phillip, at the bar, was very helpful in explaining the details of the wine list and making suggestions.  He was also great in helping us get our tickets paid up for the event we were there to participate in.  Let's face it $25 for 10 wine tastes and snacks on the patio on a beautiful late-spring evening?  That's awesome!  We were able to learn a lot about where and when and what to see when traveling to/in Croatia from Robert (host of the event).  He was very gracious (as were the patio bar tenders) and patient in explaining the details of the wines and the various regions they came from in Croatia.  He also brought around a couple of tastings that were NOT on the list... some rarer wines from his personal collection.  It was very kind of him, and the information he provided was invaluable!  All in all, between the lovely staff at Dilworth Tasting Room and the wonderful event experience, I can say that I honestly can't wait for an excuse to return!"}
{"text":"Visited with two friends on a random Tuesday night. I didn't expect it to be so cute. The patio is absolutely enchanting, we had a few bottles of wine, a few shared plates, and enjoyed the ambiance. Dilworth Tasting Room is quiet, quaint, and classy. Perfect for an intimate date or a fun friends night out. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Nice location and patio.  Food and wine menu is pedestrian at best.  Wine selections are expected and not exciting.  Servers are not trained and rely menu-pointing to order (vs. understanding native pronunciation of wine).  Not implying that everyone needs to be a somm, but it is quite entertaining the lack of wine knowledge among the staff.  Aside from location, this spot has a lot to learn.  Would not recommend for the discerning palate."}
{"text":"I'm in love with this place! My husband I recently moved to Dilworth and normally hang out at the breweries because there wasn't a laid back place to drink wine. Friday we had appetizers and some great wines by the glass in the early evening  on the patio. It was perfect. Later we went back with some friends and a had a terrific bottle of red inside. The service was great both times. The food was delicious.  We spent time getting to know the owner. By the end of the night it felt like we had been going there for years. Such a comfortable and welcoming atmosphere. We even ran into one of our daughter's friends. So, it is an awesome place for all generations!"}
{"text":"Dilworth Tasting Room is legit.  My girlfriend and I were looking for a place to go grab a couple of drinks to break up the monotony of the week by eating all of the same food all week after mass-cooking on Sunday. She suggested Dilworth Tasting Room. I gave it a quick lookup and agreed.  When we arrived, we were given the option of sitting inside - which is super nice - or to sit outside with some heaters. We chose outside because it wasn't too cold yet in December. The employees turned a few heaters on for us and pushed them close to ours seats so we could be cozy sitting outside!  Looking through the menu, our server, Nadine, was extremely helpful and really nice. She gave us solid recommendations on what wines we should order as well as the cheeses on the menu. I did a flight of whites (three good pours for $20) and they were all delicious.  We first ordered the Espana flatbread. It was OK. It tasted good, but it was something I felt like we could have easily made at home.  The real mind-blowing incredible fantastic thing about this dining experience was the cheese plate. This was hands down the best cheese plate I've ever had. We ordered the large plate - 3 cheeses and 3 meats. The money cheeses were the Rembrandt - which is an aged Gouda, and the Cambolzola - which is a fruity goat cheese. For the charcuterie we got prosciutto, coppa, and calabrese.    These cheeses were so. damn. good. They made everything on the plate taste better. Apart from the meat we ordered, there were apples, almonds, olives (ick), walnuts, three different kinds of bread, fig jam, AND orange marmalade which was amazing.   There was a ton of cheese so Nadine was able to bring us more fig jam and more bread for us to finish it off. I don't know how to describe the entire experience from the service to the cheese plate other than delightful.   WILL BE BACK AND WILL TELL FRIENDS."}
{"text":"Love the outdoor patio for drinks under the stars. The charcuterie plate is always lovely and they have a great wine and bubbly list."}
{"text":"Not even a huge fan of wine, but this place is badass.  Not normally big on service (I.e. I could care less whether I like my waiter/waitress or not), but ours was super cool and nice.  I dig it and I will likely go back.  (Even if being surrounded surrounded by groups of 15 or so congruous 'girls nights' makes me question by masculinity)"}
{"text":"Wonderful patio & very knowledgeable & pleasant staff. Love that you can select a bottle of wine from  their selection in the retail part & no fee to have that at your table. The cheese plate we had (while a little pricey) was delicious. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome place, great atmosphere and ambiance. Went with my fiancé for a bottle of wine, sat in the incredible outdoor patio and ended up staying for food. Highly recommend this place for dates and also casually hanging out."}
{"text":"I am a fan.   This place will definitely be in my regular rotation. It's got a very relaxed environment with very, very good wine. I came with some of my coworkers and it was half price bottle of Cabernets. Cheers!   We ordered a few bottles and shared some of the flatbreads and cheese and meat trays. Everything was so good! They also have a small grocery section which has some pretty good deals so it's worth checking out before you head out.   Parking can be a bit of a pain, but this place is totally worth a few trips around the block.   See you soon!"}
{"text":"Finally made it down to Dilworth Tasting Room. I love this little spot! Not only do they have a wonderful inside and outdoor space (with a pond and outdear seatings in their back patio), but they have a great array of food and wine options. This is a great venue for holiday parties or company get togethers. I came for their fall tasting menu and was pleased at the variety of foods offered. Things you can see on their fall menu: Market salad (warm root veggies with goat cheese bark, nuts and raspberry vinaigrette), chicken dumpking, scallops, pork, beef, and an assortment of charcuterie boards and flatbreads, two of my favorite apps. Plus, you have an abundance of wine choices and craft cocktails to pair with any dish and flavor. They also have a sommelier on staff. Great ambiance and local spot in Dilworth!"}
{"text":"I heard a lot of good things so I decided to visit, the place looks good, the wine selection was great, food was just average. The place is just a regular wine bar and tapas, nothing special, parking as usual horrible in that part of town. Regarding the service, they need more servers and more training, our server was rude and careless, she had a nasty attitude. Not was I was expecting."}
{"text":"Great selection of wine. I love the outdoor space for some quality time with company. Classy atmosphere and warm service. Less mainstream than the other wine bars in Charlotte (which I prefer). I would like to see more vegan options on the menu :)"}
{"text":"Met some friends here for a first time hangout. Great selection of wine. Great place to people watch. If you're hungry, food is a bit expensive for the portion and don't expect to be full. Everything was tasty but again portions were on the mini side. Space is open and comfortable. You can buy by the glass or pick a bottle they have lined up on the wall. I love wine so would be back to sample more!!"}
{"text":"A terrific experience that you'll love! Inside or on the beautiful courtyard! Impeccable wine & Soecialty beer selection, plus the best charcuterie in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"After seating us, our server abandoned us and started drinking. My friend's food wasn't delivered and they had to ask about it. Then our second server started drinking, and only reappeared when we gave him side eye. I'd expect better service for the price."}
{"text":"Fantastic new addition to Charlotte! We hosted my husband's birthday there, and it was an absolute hit. The space is open, warm and casual. The wine selection is phenomenal -- and affordable -- and the food was delicious. (The grape bruschetta and warm cheese and truffle oil baguettes are repeat offenders.) The weather didn't allow us to take advantage of the patio, but it's beautiful outside -- going to be a popular spot come spring. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"The patio out back is AWESOME. Beautiful with a great vibe! Great selection of wine and love the cheese board options. My friends live next door and have been regulars for a couple years. Can't believe I'm just discovering it! It's dark inside, so makes for a great low key girls night or date night spot."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh! This place is awesome!!! Took my Fiancè for drinks before dinner and it was heavenly. Very secluded, classy and romantic. Service was five star. Derrick was AMAZING! He suggested reservations which I'm SO glad we made. And also asked us our wine preference and NAILED IT with our flight. Can't wait to come back. This is a Charlotte gem!"}
{"text":"A handful of friends recommended Dilworth Tasting Room. It took me a while to make it but I am glad I did! They have awesome indoor and outdoor seating areas. If it's warm out I would definitely recommend the patio. I would ALSO recommend the meat and cheese plates! They have a great selection of delicious cheeses and meats! Awesome food, great wine selection, top notch service, and an amazing atmosphere, if you haven't been you should definitely check it out."}
{"text":"We went to DTR with my boyfriends work and since there were quite a few of us we sat in a reserved space. I was starving and ready to eat and I'd never been to DTR before.  I didn't order any wine since I live quite far, but the selection was massive! Don't assume you only have to get the bottles on the menu, you can hand pick one from the wall. If you do so, you do have to buy the bottle, but they don't charge you a service fee on those bottles like some other restaurants do.  We ordered the bruschetta and the margherita panini with prosciutto. Both were extremely delicious. The sizes were perfect, too and come on a bed of spinach. We also ordered the Nutella and strawberry dessert panini that was pretty good. I didn't leave feeling overly stuffed or gross. The meal was a perfect amount and delicious.   The service was occasionally slow, but it honestly was likely due to our party size. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Chill ambiance with a nice patio out back. Extensive wine and beer list. Glasses of wine start at $10+ and beers are more reasonably priced. Limited menu with panini, flatbread, and cheese boards--food was delicious but on the pricey side for the portion given. This is definitely a cute date night place but a tad too expensive to make it a regular spot."}
{"text":"This is such a hidden gem with it's secret outside garden! The wines are impeccable. They have tons of selections and they will help you pick out your wine if you can't decide! The cheese plates are worth the money! Two cheeses and two meats were more than enough food for my fiancé and I.   Jaffer & Ilene were AMAZING host. This is a great local wine tasting room! Thank you for the best hospitality ever!"}
{"text":"If charcuterie boards are your jam, then Dilworth Tasting Room is your place. I visited here with a bunch of coworkers, and it was great because they had a huge table on one side to accommodate large parties, and also quite a wine selection to browse if you're looking for something to accompany your meal.   We split a few charcuterie boards (chef's choice - I think my favorite was the calabrese) and a couple flatbreads. Everything was delicious, and overall it was a great time for the team!"}
{"text":"Dilworth Tasting Room scores big with this neighborhood gem.  I had bookmarked DTR after Jess L.  received ROTD status, then forgot about it. Today, I read Candyce B's review and just had to experience it firsthand.  So happy!  Lori and I arrived on a warm, autumn Saturday at opening which is 1 p.m.  Promptly greeted and seated by Andrew, whom remained our server throughout our stay.  Consummate professional.  The 2 cheese/2 meat board, along with a crisp  bottle of Chardonnay was perfect for lunch.  Everything was quality:  wine, meats, cheese, service, price.  It was a wonderful way to enjoy lunch with the person you love most.   I say, \"Give this place a whirl!\""}
{"text":"This is specific to their new coffee service. The cappuccino was great, and I love that they brew Stumptown. The drip coffee was a little pricey for a cup you fill yourself, but it was good. I also just love the atmosphere in there."}
{"text":"Such a great place to go and hang out. Owner is amazing!! Ambiance is on point, if you can sit outside."}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere and great place to come after work for wine and a nosh. I loved that a hint of Dilworth Billiards is still here. Also has one of the most beautiful outdoor spaces in all of Charlotte."}
{"text":"This place has transformed! Its just a bit down the street from Tyber Creek Pub and I didn't have trouble finding nearby street parking on a recent weeknight. The garden is gorgeous. Dogs are only allowed at have bars in the garden and inside.   Like other have mentioned the meet and cheese platters are Instagram gold and pretty large. The bread isn't anything special and I should have asked for a double serving of the jam.  Service was lovely, this is great place to enjoy a glass or bottle of wine on a night out."}
{"text":"This place has everything, cocktails, wine and beer and tapas. The atmosphere is comfortable and very welcoming. They have a great outdoor space. The bar team really knows their product and are very friendly and accommodating!  Try this place. It will not disappoint"}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday and am so happy I did. The server asked us what we liked and then made recommendations. She was spot on. They also have comfy red chairs to lounge in. Outside is a lovely seating area that looks like a garden but there is seating as well as a bar"}
{"text":"Dilworth Tasting Room offers a sanctuary from the hustle and bustle of busy restaurants and breweries.  The interior offers couches, chairs and tables that makes it feel intimate and homey at the same time.  Walk past the bar into a garden courtyard with a koi pond, another bar and garden tables.    The waitstaff is very attentive and will help you select the perfect bottle or glass of wine (or bottle of beer).  The food menu is limited, but has several small plate options for snacking.    We stopped in on a quiet Tuesday night for a couple of glasses of wine and charcuterie. There are not bargains to be found here - glasses of wine are $12-$16 and small plates start at $10.  We got a medium charcuterie (2 meats, 2 cheese) for just under $30.    All in all, Dilworth Tasting Room is lovely, but I think we'll likely continue our casual wine/snack outings to venues that aren't quite so pricey."}
{"text":"Hubs and I went here to celebrate a friend's birthday. The location is great nestled in the quaint residential Dilworth/Southend. We didn't see a private parking lot, but found free parking on the street. The interior was very nice, lots and lots of wine on display. They have a variety of seating like really comfy couches, chairs, tables, coffee tables, and bar seating.  I have heard amazing things about the patio seating area, but it was wayyy too cold to check it out.   Our experience was mediocre, as we had reservations confirmed the day before and there was a double booking for our table. Our service was okay - it was very busy and I think our waiter did the best he could, but we were neglected for a while. We did end up getting a cheese and meat platter that we didn't order for free, so that was a nice perk.  The wine per glass is overpriced in my opinion, but Hubs and I are not huge wine connoisseurs. We both ordered the chicken and dumplings and were disappointed. The portions were small and the dish did not wow either of us, and again was a little overpriced. We may return to check out the patio area since it was spoken so highly of, but it wasn't my favorite."}
{"text":"I decided to celebrate my birthday in Charlotte and I am so glad I did. I already wasn't in the best mood due to the fact that I am another year older but our wine connoisseur changed that. I work in the liquor industry as a liquor rep so I know how it goes but the way she described all of the wines, phenomenal. I could sell so much more if I had her talent. She was so sweet and helped us with everything. After all these years, I finally found \"my\" wine. She said if we trust her then she will pick all of the wines for us and I'm glad I did. I, unfortunately, do not remember her name but she is Russian and blonde, I will definitely come back. Thank you again."}
{"text":"This new little wine spot in the middle of Dilworth is a gem. Great variety of wines with many price ranges. Amazing charcuterie boards with reasonable prices. Friendly and attentive staff. The back patio is beautiful and sure to be a hit this summer. Only downfall is parking. But, let's be honest, you shouldn't be driving after a lot of great wine anyway!"}
{"text":"The porch is gorgeous! The servers are friendly and the food is awesome!  They have many selections and will suggest wines that you may like and give you a taste should you not want to commit to a full glass beforehand. The cheese and meat plate is worth! Two cheeses and two meats were good enough for dinner for my boyfriend and I. This is my new favorite place!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem that I almost don't want to do a review for. I am not even sure what this place used to be but we happened in on a Friday evening based on a friend's suggestion. We didn't take advantage of the exterior seating area, but I bet it is fabulous on an evening with warmer temperatures. We were greeted promptly and asked where we wanted to sit. We chose inside due to the cooler weather. There is also bar seating, regular tables and a large community table on the right. We tried a couple cocktails along with a glass of wine. The service was spot on. Because we had other dinner plans, the only thing we shared was a couple of flatbreads. It was great and even though we didn't try more, I would definitely return. Can't wait to take advantage of the patio or bring a jacket to enjoy the patio. They do have heaters."}
{"text":"What an amazing time we had on our first visit here. Friendly staff, great vibe, beautiful motif. We ordered a few glasses of wine, after being greeted immediately upon approaching the bar, with smiling friendly bartender. The back patio is such an inviting place to hang out and chat with familiar faces, including the previous Dilworth Billiards owner, Eric Sprouse. Excellent wine selections by the glass, as well as, by the bottle. When we were ready to depart, we promptly received our check and a warm \"thank you\" when we asked to close out the tab. Very inviting place and Jaffer, the owner, was extremely personable by stopping to say hi and asked how our evening was. Top-notch place. We will definitely be back. So excited to visit our new neighborhood wine room again."}
{"text":"Visited here a week or two after they opened (finally got around to posting) and was impressed with the wine offerings, but pleased to see a carefully selected small menu of craft beers served in proper glasses. Definitely somewhere to see and be seen, it gets loud easily, but fills an important niche for the neighborhood. Just steps away from the hustle and bustle of the 20s-focused South End, couples in their 30s should feel right at home. The two red couches really stand out as statement pieces to define the space. What else do you need to know? Good wine and limited on-street parking make this the perfect place if you live in walking distance or a short Uber ride away. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Was super excited for this place to open. But was disappointed my first visit. Wait staff isn't knowledgeable about simple things like if there was a purse hook under bar. Paid zero attention to my group and constantly had to ask for help. Menu isn't anything great unless you just want cheese. Noise level was very high and had to scream for anyone to hear you."}
{"text":"Nothing but the best here. We came here for a happy hour because we all were in the mood for wine. We ended up dubbing this our \"fancy happy hour\" due to the caliber of the wine and food.  There's an indoor area which is nice, but the patio is absolutely charming. It's almost like a courtyard with tables scattered around. In the center, there's a koi pond. With it being outside, we felt like we were at a friend's house just talking for hours which we actually did stay for hours.   The wine is good. Our server helped us find a pinot to share and brought out tastings of her recommendations.  She also shared the food special which was oysters Rockefeller. Two orders please.   On top of that we ordered a charcuterie which was divine. The oysters Rockefeller were good. This was my first time having them. I wanted more so the flavor was good. I don't remember everything on the charcuterie, but it was a big serving. The brie cheese was my favorite which I put on a piece of bread.   Service was exceptional.  We intended on only staying for one bottle, but stayed for three. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had such a lovely time at Dilworth Tasting Room! It was the first stop on our date night, and we were able to find two spots right up at the bar where we could observe and truly enjoy the ambiance from the middle of the room.  The bar/restaurant is very loud, but if you're in the mood for a \"happenin\" night, it doesn't bother you. The decorations and seating are very interesting, lots of bottles on the wall (of course) and the seating is a mix of regular tables, cafe tables, bar seating, and couches with oversize coffee tables.  To drink we opted for the white wine flight. The bartender was kind enough to explain to us her favorites and what she thought would appeal to us (we're dry wine drinkers, not fans of the sweet stuff.) We opted for a straight white and two roses and we were not disappointed.  To eat we split a little green salad and a \"medium\" meat and cheese plate (two meats and two cheeses). The second bartender who took our food order tried to push us towards the \"safe\" options (which I don't blame him, not everyone in Charlotte is an adventurous eater) but we pushed for the dried beef instead of one of the more \"typical\" meats and we were SO glad that we did. It was phenomenal.   The prices are a little high, but nothing more than you'd expect for this type of place, and we knew it would be a splurge going into it.    Overall, we enjoyed the ambiance, food, and drinks. We both could see ourselves going back one day."}
{"text":"Really dig the vibe. Great after dinner or happy hour spot. They have a huge wine selection and a pretty extensive cocktail list. This bar is pretty close to my house so I was able to walk over on snow day. The menu offers some small plates (including a customizable cheese plate and different bruschetta options) as well as larger entree items. If you're feeling sweet, grab a desert and a fresh espresso drink. I'll definitely be returning time and time again. I haven't been able to check out the garden patio due to cold weather but I hear it's definitely a rare gem here in the Queen City."}
{"text":"Great comfortable spot for enjoying a glass of wine, craft beer (bottles only) with some delicious cheese/meat/nut plates."}
{"text":"Fabulous! Loved everything. Great service, food, and wine. The owner, Jaffer, checked on us several  times. The outside patio is gorgeous! We will be back! Yum!"}
{"text":"What a find!  My first visit to Charlotte and The Dilworth Tasting Room was definitely the highlight of my trip!  I've visited wine bars/restaurants like this all over the country and all over the world and can safely say that Dilworth is among the best anywhere. Very friendly staff, comfortable environment and BEAUTIFUL outdoor patio.   Enjoyed terrific cocktails, pasta, wine and a great vibe with super-cool and very friendly patrons.  All the retail wines can be enjoyed at your table at NO upcharge . . . insane!!! Great neighborhood with plenty of parking and Uber was there in less than five minutes to pick us up. A definite must-visit if you like good wine at a fair price in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Love this place! I went on a date at a neighboring restaurant and was rushed out the door after glass #1 of wine (this was a FIRST date). We decided to go to DTR and found we should've gone here from the beginning! Their door says they close at 10pm Monday - Thursday but we walked in at 9:30 (hoping to get at least 1 drink) and Derrick offered us, not only a glass of wine but, food and the nicest conversation.    THANKS DERRICK! we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Hosted my best friends bridal shower here last weekend and it couldn't have been a more beautiful venue. Everyone was so impressed with the service and the food/wine. Definitely one of my favorite new spots in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Dilworth Tasting Room is wine bar with a private courtyard / patio located in Dilworth area of Charlotte, NC.  Their focus is on low-production, high quality wines.  Their menu also has cocktails, cheese & charcuterie, and food (appetizers, bruschetta, paninis, flatbreads, and desserts).   The atmosphere is pretty neat.  We sat in the back area near the water fountain.  We all decided to get Wine Flights (Three 3 Ounce Pours for $20).  I got the Dolcetto, Carmenere, and Valpolicella.  The night that we went, they also had a special for a free personal sized cheese / charcuterie board with wine purchase.  Woot Woot!!    Fun environment!!  Cool vibes!!"}
{"text":"Had a great first visit... Loved the patio area complete with hanging lanterns and a koi pond. The crowd was definitely trending younger (under 35) but there was a diverse group overall. Lots of unique wine selections that were fun to try, food was tasty and well presented.   Looking forward to checking it out again on a weekend. Wanna check out that puffy red couch.  Oh, parking is a little iffy with lots of signs threatening towing in the area but we found some street side parking less than half a block away."}
{"text":"I am only giving this place 4 stars instead of 5 for a couple reasons (explained next) but I want to be clear that overall I love DTR. The decor and location are awesome and their staff is amazing and very friendly. Unfortunately, even when it's not really crowded, the sound carries a lot and makes it hard to converse. I was also slightly disappointed by the number of wines offered by the glass - would have expected there to be a larger variety."}
{"text":"What an awesome spot for anyone who loves wine bars!  I went to Dilworth Tasting Room on a Sunday afternoon.  Definitely not packed, so it was nice to stroll on out to the patio and sit by the Koi pond.  The patio is really pretty and quaint.  Guys: This needs to be your go-to date spot if you live in the area!  Ladies: perfect for just a small get together.  We had a really attentive waiter who asked us about what kind of wine we liked to drink and brought us a few samples to taste before settling on a glass.  They have a nice variety at different price points depending on how much you want to spend.  Also great if you want to buy a bottle in their side retail section and bring it into the restaurant area (rather than ordering off their menu).  No corkage fee if you do it!  The food was really just outstanding.  The cheese board is definitely pricey, but to my surprise, you get a ton of stuff with it, like nuts and different breads and jam.  The presentation and variety was quite beautiful!  Also, if you get the Margarita panini, do yourself a favor and add prosciutto for an extra $3...it's worth it.  Great ambiance, great food and obviously great wine."}
{"text":"I have never been so disappointed to have to write a not so great review before, especially if its customer service driven review. I have been to DTR twice before but only for wine in the main bar area. Customer service had never been less than accommodating and wine selection was/is great, however, this past Saturday I went with the full intension of finally being able to sit out on the patio, and finally get to have dinner. While reservations were not made ahead of time, we were able to grab a place at the bar for a pre-dinner drink and asked to get the next table out on the patio. There was not a seat available both inside and outside without a 45 minute wait. The gentlemen took down my friends number so we could be sent a text as soon as the preferred table outside became available. So to our surprise, when we got the text, we quickly closed the tab and went up to the same associate to find out, this table was no longer available. Disappointed as I was at first, he offered us another round of each wine we had been drinking without hesitation, GREAT. We then had to stand for a few minutes for the next table to open but it wasn't terribly long, or maybe it was the wine?! In any case, I was excited to now sit down at a table and order some food. This assumption became unrealistic when we had to ask this same, what I perceive is the manager, about the possibility of ordering outside. Not only were we not offered new drinks, but we were not greeted nor provided with water or menus after sitting for 15-20 mins. The server came about 5 mins after we had to ask for service and he seemed overwhelmed. He was after all the ONLY server outside, really? I quickly realized that having dinner this evening was not going to happen, at least in a timely manner so we got up and left. I have been following DTR on insta for some time, and waited for the perfect weather and evening to enjoy but it was sorely disappointing and this is me trying to be modest. My first two visits were not even close to this particular visit, because I was hungry, thirsty and annoyed. I am still wondering why they would allow for this to go on?"}
{"text":"I love Dilworth Tasting Room (DTR) and I often meet friends there, when they visit Charlotte.  I could spend all day & evening relaxing on their beautifully-landscaped patio!  Their indoor seating is sophisticated, attractive, & comfortable as well.  DTR boasts an impressive wine collection and their small plate menu selections are delicious.  In addition, staff members are friendly, helpful, & knowledgeable.  This is the kind of place that draws you back, again & again, making it a great neighborhood hangout!"}
{"text":"We are so happy this neighborhood wine bar is now open. We cannot find enough words to describe how much we love this space. The wine list is a fine selection of bottles to please any wine lover, the small plates are the perfect amount of food and so yum. The interior is absolutely stunning! Our service person was so helpful and attentive when we couldn't decide what to try, and the outdoor patio space with Koi pond is heavenly. We see this as a regular stop for us. Welcome to Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Welcome to Charlotte, DTR! A friend and I had to visit on opening weekend because we were regulars of the former establishment, Dilworth Billiards where we made some of our best memories in Charlotte. To celebrate the opening, we treated ourselves to some bubbly and amazing red wine... the beverage selection was impressive and I can't wait to return to taste the food, sip more vino and enjoy the gorgeous space which was perfectly welcoming and charming. LOVE the statement red couches. Also, kudos to their social media and PR folks... mission accomplished to fill the space with an upbeat crowd! We wish you all the best in this new venture!"}
{"text":"Dilworth Tasting Room was AMAZING! We came here on a Saturday afternoon and sat outside. We both opted for Wine flights (3 for $25) and sat at the bar.   I forget which wines I had gotten exactly, but 2 were Cabernet Sauvignon and 1 was a Red Blend (all 3 chosen by our Wine Connoisseur/Bartender). Much much later, we had ordered a cheese sampler - Brie & Goat Cheese. 2 cheeses for about $30 which was a bit pricey in my opinion. It was still delicious, and I felt guilty not finishing it.   Great spot to come on a date or with friends/family!"}
{"text":"What a treat the day after Thanksgiving!  We were visiting our daughter from Maryland and just wanted to relax and have some wine. While we didn't want to necessarily do a tasting they still let us taste before ordering a glass. I had the Freelander Cabernet Sauvignon from Napa. It was extremely good. The hubs and my daughter both had Writer's Block Zinfandel from Paso Robles, CA. I tasted theirs and it was very good. Nice cozy atmosphere but even better was the garden area outside!  We managed get a picture by the fountain. They had nice heaters at each table. Service was very friendly and attentive and the prices very reasonable. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This is a beautiful place. The patio is essentially a garden retreat. A couple of nicely private tables with flowers all over. The wines are nice although a bit in the pricey side. The apps are good and the waitresses/waiters rock. Very friendly and personable. Nice selection of charcuterie items. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"It's been said that anyone who says money cannot buy happiness has clearly never spent their money on dessert and wine. My advice is to dress to the nines, and take your date to Dilworth Tasting Room. If you want to please your date, get the assorted cookies & candies ($6), and add the perfect complimentary wine flight for extra $9 per person, and share a great time!  For sophistication and class, go now. Thank me later.  Four Yelps."}
{"text":"Great wine selection and social environment. Shawn was the host and so friendly. Seating was good with a mix of hi top, regular tables along with couches."}
{"text":"Can't believe it took me so long to review this place! This is our \"date night\" spot. We come here at least once a week, sometimes even more. We always sit at the bar, but they do have tables and couches that you can also enjoy. The decor is beautiful and the space is very welcoming and has a cozy feeling. The service is even better. Even before we became regulars, we were greeted right away and got to sample some really nice wines. The bartenders are very knowledgeable and can point you in the right direction if your not sure what you feel like drinking. But every time I go in, I always like to try something new and I haven't been disappointed yet. They have a lovely patio section. I can see it from my place :) and since I am walking distance to here, I've never had parking issues. Overall a great spot to enjoy for a nice night out!"}
{"text":"This place was fantastic! The outside patio is so quaint and beautiful. Perfect spot to enjoy a nice glass of wine. And the charcuterie platter was fantastic, and very large compared to most. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Awesome addition to Dilworth!  Great variety of wines and beers.  Can't believe someone would put a bad review on their second night of being open.  Servers were working hard to keep up with the packed house (not an empty seat in the house).  Every food item that came out of the kitchen looked awesome.  Technical glitches will get worked out.  DTR is a fantastic addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Had snacks and wine at Dilworth Tasting Room on Friday night. For food we split the Burrata and Medium Combinazoni, which came with two cheeses and two meats.  Quality Wine with charcuterie is one of my favorite things in the world. The mixture of delicious wines with unique meats and cheeses is something that is hard to mess up, however also difficult to do very well. And while Dilworth Tasting Room did a decent job, nothing about our evening had me excited to return. For food we first ordered the Burrata, which frankly was sad. Served with basil pesto and tomatoe concasse, the presentation did not make up for a lackluster cheese. Burrata requires extra love and I just did not feel it with this dish. The Medium Combinzoni was a little better. For our two cheeses we got a soft Latur and a semi soft Thomasville Tomme, and for our meats we selected Prosciutto Di Parma and Coppa. Mixed in with walnuts, almonds, pecans, fruits, tomatoes, apricot, and apple jam, it was a tasty collection. However, the bread left much to be desired. In terms of wine, I was just not very excited about anything on the menu. Eventually we settled on a red blend, but it was merely serviceable. The menu needed expanded options, with some higher quality choices. It would also be helpful for them to provide additional information about the flavor and possible pairings. It is supposed to be a tasting room after all.  Quantity Neither of the dishes we ordered was very large, but it was fair for a snack. They had a few larger dishes on the menu, but it is a place I would stick to wine and snacks.  Value I felt the food prices were fair with most of the snacks falling in the $10 to $15 range. The charcuterie boards were a little pricier, but with high quality items it made sense, however the math for the different sizes did not. I was less enthusiastic with the wine prices, which ranged from $30 to $60. And while that is affordable, that signified a lack of high quality selections, instead providing lots of mid-level choices.  Ambiance Dilworth Tasting Room is a cute little bar and restaurant found in the South End area of Charlotte. When you enter they have a small wine store on the right and then a large open space for diners and loungers on the left. The back wall contains a long bar, with the unique design of bottles hanging sideways illuminated by back lighting. The center of the space had bright red couches and then tables filled the area around it. In the background a mix of jazz and indie rock filled up the space nicely. Had the weather been nicer I would have loved to sit outside. A brief peek showed a beautiful backyard oasis. With lots of trees and plants, a central pond, and strung up lights, it seemed like a perfect place to enjoy some wine. Unfortunately the weather was dark and gloomy and outside did not provide anywhere to hide.  Crowd On Friday night this place filled up very quickly. Threatening weather with on and off showers did not deter folks. We ended up selecting a table inside worried that the weather may force folks inside. However, the rain never arrived, and luckily so, as there was not enough space inside for everyone since both inside and out were packed. It looked like an after-work crowd with just a few couples mixed in.  Service We had come to the Dilworth Tasting Room planning to relax with a bottle of wine and casually snack on some of the food. Our waitress seemed to have different plans as she was constantly pushing for us to order more or get out. It reached its peak when she brought out menus again just in case we wanted to order something else. I don't think I've ever been at a restaurant where without asking they brought back the regular menus. It was extremely off-putting and the waitress did a poor job hiding her frustration in us trying to enjoy our visit.  Parking We did not have to worry about parking since we took a car service, but there did appear to be some street parking along the surrounding streets.  Extra Maybe I entered with expectations that were too high, but as a wine bar Dilworth Tasting Room was just average. They did have a decent amount of selections for food and wine, as well as beer and cocktails, but nothing really inspiring. Too much middle of the road and not enough bold and unique. Add in less than stellar service and you have a flawed wine bar, but one with a lot of potential."}
{"text":"This is such a cute place! Lot of wine selections. I had the artichoke bruschetta and it was delicious! Definitely will come back. Parking on side of the road - downside."}
{"text":"Their cheese plates are very good - I like it more than Foxcroft!  I would love a few more options on the menu, a few more paninis or some easy pasta dishes. Maybe ibérico ham? Love that they do not have a corkage fee and have a very diverse wine selection. I do agree that it gets a bit loud, but happy to see they extended hours on Sunday! I had thought they closed at 5pm. Service has been very helpful and knowledgable the two times I've stopped in."}
{"text":"I think Dilworth Tasting Room has the best patio and they have plenty of heaters to stay warm on cool evenings.  There is a little bar on the patio as well as one inside with a small dining room.  Parking is a small lot or street parking, so it can be a bit difficult to get parking and I'm always nervous if I'm parking in another business' lot.  I definitely recommend reservations as they seem to stay consistently busy! (Awesome!)  They have one large table on the patio that gets reserved quickly so if you want to take a group there, don't wait until the last minute to reserve it.  The food is delicious and usually plenty to share.  Great flavors and options.  Great wine selections and the staff is knowledgeable about what works together and is good about taking your vague likes and translating that into an exceptional choice.  Sometimes I feel as if the wait staff gets a little overwhelmed with orders and so they take one order for the table and turn around and take off to put it in and then come back at a later time and take another one or two orders...  I think it would be ok to let the servers write down orders or give them a tablet they can take around with them so they can take care of everyone at the table at the same time.  Other than that little oddity everyone is very nice and I love having this as a go to place in my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"We got the charcuterie plate and it was very good.  The nuts were apparently roasted in house.  We asked because we were surprised by how good they were. The cheese and salami were excellent as well.  They give you more bread if you ask.  I would definitely come back for it again."}
{"text":"I love the outdoor space, similar to the previous iteration, and the indoor space is much improved.  The service was good, though confusing. I wasn't sure when I first arrived if it was seat yourself or wait; apparently it was seat yourself. We sat down outside, and a guy came to give us menus,  and told us we could buy wine by the bottle inside. I got up to check it out; the bottle section is rather ridiculous. Two different staff persons explained its set up in two different ways, and neither made much sense. You can't see the labels without pulling each wine bottle out because it's more of a home set-up. The price is also missing on most bottles, which is a big deal. A server (?) asked if I needed help, and let me try some wine. This was excellent! However, after I picked out a bottle, the bartender who originally sat us acted pissed off that someone else helped us! Our cheese plate was excellent, but the odd service and poor bottle set up leave much to be desired."}
{"text":"Best wine experience in Charlotte hands down. Service is amazing! Jaffer took care of us and selected more than 10 wines for us to try and totally nailed it. Our charcuterie plate was excellent and they even allowed us to modify for special dietary needs."}
{"text":"I want to be honest but also support new local spots. That being said, I did like the menu and the server was able to point me to a good, dry white wine. She also ignored us pretty much all night and we had to hunt for her to order another glass or bottle. Then again to get our checks. I hope this place does very well and I'm leaving my honest review in hopes that you may see it and fix everything that went awry for future patrons. I don't plan on returning. And to note, there was something odd about the acoustics that made it incredibly loud inside and hard to hear."}
{"text":"This place is so freakin cute!!!!!!  I love it.  The patio is full of plants, plenty of seating, a fountain and a bar.    We ordered a brotte bottle of wine and it was delicious!  I was craving something sweet so I ordered the chocolate dessert plate and it was to die for!  The chocolate and fruit paired really well with my wine.  The service was a little spotty because they were very busy.  Although it was busy the patio still felt romantic and Private.    As a quick tip there is only one restroom for men and one for women so expect to wait in line.    We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wow! Why haven't I found this place before? What a beautiful space. The patio is really a hidden gem. I can see myself spending many summer evenings here. The food is really good, if the menu is a bit small. And I wish they had cocktails. But, this place is not to be missed."}
{"text":"DTR is awesome. Laidback relaxed atmosphere with great staff, food and drinks.  We could not have been happier with our experience here! I contacted the owner about having a surprise party for my girlfriend (now fiance'e) with all our close friends and family after i proposed. I met with the owner, Mr. Kovic and he made the plans simple and easy. He estimated the amount of food needed perfectly as well as suggesting which items would work best for our group. He suggested several different champagnes and set everything up with me. We had our surprise event outside on the patio. It was picturesque. The patio is beautiful, shady and quiet. The food was outstanding. Derrick, one of the managers took care of us during our event and was amazing as well. He stayed in close communication  with me every step to bring the food out when we wanted it, bringing drinks, keeping everyone's glasses full and even taking photos for us. The experience was great and i know we will be back often to celebrate more events or just have a drink. I highly recommend checking it out. Thanks Jaffer!"}
{"text":"My friend and I had pre dinner drinks and a charcuterie board at Dilworth Tasting Room. I had a new cocktail called the New Yorker - it was very good!! Bulleit Rye with simple syrup and red wine. For the board, we had the prosciutto and a spicy salami for the meats and the drunken goat and the Rembrandt Gouda for the cheeses. All were delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Charcuterie. Get it. End of story, end of review.   But seriously, they have four different options. Not only are they possibly the most beautiful charcuterie boards in Charlotte, the meat and cheese options are absolutely delicious. At most places, these are usually pretty pricey and you don't get a whole lot. Not here, I feel like you totally get your money's worth.   The wine options and selections are well done and well curated. They also have a cocktail menu and beers that you won't find anywhere else in Charlotte. Do not be afraid to ask questions or ask for suggestions.  The patio/courtyard is ridiculously gorgeous. You want to sit outside when you come here. This is a perfect spot for after work drinks, date night, girls night, etc.   It does get busy, so if you have a group I recommend making a reservation. You can do that on their website. Coming soon: they'll be on the No Wait app!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday night with friends. We walked in and sat at the sofas. We were greated with menus and waters. That is where the good service ends. While we were there, there were two tables inside and max 3 small groups outside with at least 3 servers in the floor. I witnessed multiple customers having to go to the bar to even get service. I understand that but on a dead night that should not be the case. We waited over 30 min to order our wine which came out without a cooler or option to keep cool. It was a white.  We ended up asking a random waiter who said even though we were not in his section he would help. I'm sorry but that shouldn't matter when your place is dead. The food ordering was just as bad. We sent someone to the bar who had to wait there 10 min to be acknowledged. The food was really good and the wine was ok. We ordered a second round of food through the bar since no server ever came to us. I know they claim to be big on service but honestly I would have thought I was dinning at food lion based off of the service. But even food lion has better service. All the servers looked like deer in the headlights with barely any tables. If you're looking for a special outing this is not the place even on an off night. In order to close checks we all just paid cash at the bar to get it over with faster. We never actually saw the server assigned to our section. I can forgive lack of wine knowledge but not lack of service."}
{"text":"Great ambiance both indoors and outdoors (love the garden patio with the koi pond). Fun and eclectic wine by the glass options, which can all be ordered as wine flights. Delicious small plates. Great service. This place is a gem!"}
{"text":"This place has a really cool vibe and is in a great and upcoming area in downtown Charlotte. The cocktail menu is a little bit limited, but what they have they make quite well. We had about an hours wait on a Friday night and after checking out the menu decided to go somewhere else for dinner but did stay for a cocktail and appetizer. Menu is a little limited and fairly expensive. They had a pretty good wine selection in a separate little room available wines by the bottle to purchase. Service was fine but not exceptional.   I think there a better dinner options in Charlotte,  but it's a great place to meet friends for a drink!"}
{"text":"Fantastic little hidden gem in the South End area! I went to this place expecting it to be similar to Vin Master, but it's a completely different experience. Really authentic, intimate setting with European inspired interior and a great selection of wine from all over the world. You can also buy a bottle and they cork it for you if you don't finish! Our waiter Derek was AWESOME. He spent time explaining everything on the menu and giving fantastic recommendations. The staff makes the experience something to remember.   I ordered the three cheese panini with truffle oil and it was delicious. I wanted something that I can share tapas style and they cut it evenly for both of us. We also ordered the small cheese plate which was fantastic as well. My only negative comment about this is, that there wasn't enough bread to go with all the toppings they give you. I wish they could provide some crackers to help you finish all the grapes and cheese that they provide. The jam is AMAZING by again I wish they gave a little more.   Overall this place was extremely authentic and a great place to take anyone visiting from out of town. They will be so impressed!  Check this place out."}
{"text":"This was my third time being here and it's been great every time (if you forget the parking situation). Solid wine selection, the atmosphere is wonderful, and the food has been yummy every time.   Two of the times I've been here it's been with a large group (book club and networking event) and they have the space and tables to accommodate. Overall I'm a fan!   BUT parking. It's not ideal, but that's South End and Dilworth for you."}
{"text":"First experience with the Dilworth Tasting Room insures that we'll be back.  A combination of wine bar/retail store/eatery - you'll be super impressed with the great selection of wines and high end beers, super knowledgeable staff and owners.  The place gives you the feel of true to life hometown \"Cheers\", convenient, comfortable, non-pretentious. An in-town location makes it a great place to walk or Uber too (parking at times might be a challenge).  While luxuriating on the large red couches in the center of the facility - you expect \"Norm\" to fly through that door at anytime. The wine selection is extraordinary, with owner/sommelier Jaffer Kovic at the ready to make a recommendation based on pallet and price point. Jaffer made it a point to come over, to sit a bit to discuss the wines, rugby, or the his past experiences. They have excellent wines available by the glass. Although we did not try any of the tapas offering - we'll save that for the next trip. If you are looking for a place to get out of the rush, unwind, and simply chill - enjoy this place - where in time, I bet \"everyone will know your name\".  Enjoy"}
{"text":"This place screams millennial, and I have to admit, it's great! The charcuterie options are awesome and the stemless wine glasses are classy. The outdoor space is cute with the pond and the atmosphere is great.  Good option for a gals night out!"}
{"text":"We came here after Tyber Creek on a Sunday afternoon and had a great experience! Derek was our bartender and was very informative about our wine selection as well as the menu. Delicious food, delicious wine! 10/10 would recommend!!"}
{"text":"Very nice outdoor seating. Was told I received the last bottle of the type of beer I wanted-my first bottle and this was at 7pm on a Friday night... food was ok but the menu really needs to be developed"}
{"text":"I had an extremely fabulous visit this past weekend. I haven't gotten back here in awhile, but I'm sure glad that I had the chance to come back. I sat outside on the patio, which I had not even knew existed before. It is absolutely beautiful! So many cute little corners and areas to sit outside, with fabulous lighting and even a little pond.   The service was great! The whole staff was friendly and welcoming. I had a wonderful time. I am excited to come back again soon."}
{"text":"By far my favorite tapas restaurant in NC. Always come in whenever I'm in town for work"}
{"text":"Love this place! Wine selection and food are terrific! The staff and the owner are personable and knowledgeable...I like that they have high quality liquors for those who prefer that to wine and beer...the ambiance is sophisticated and intimate....we will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"What a great neighborhood spot! Their charcuterie board is one of the best around! The service is awesome, great atmosphere and fantastic cocktails! The garden out back is very special too!  Pro tip- buy your bottle of wine from the wine shop, there is less markup and they won't charge a corkage fee to drink in the bar. If you don't finish re-cork and take the wine to go!"}
{"text":"We popped in last night for date night and this place is fantastic. It's a large space with a patio so great to go with a group or with just one or two people. Our server was knowledgeable and super helpful in picking out wine. Joey is not a wine drinker... yet, so I decided we would do a white. You can either order from the bar menu or if you're buying a bottle grab one from the retail space and they will uncork it for you. The had some Napa favorites but we decided to try something new from Italy, I bought an extra bottle to bring home. The food was also delicious. I'm a sucker for a cheese board and this place had a great selection of cheese, we ended up doing to medium tray with two cheeses and two meats. We got the Brie, Gouda, Coopa, and Prosciutto. All delicious and mostly consumed by me. Joey also got the chicken and dumplings which is not your moms chicken and dumplings, it comes out in its own cast iron skillet with large pieces of chicken and gnocchi. Can't wait to go back and try more wine and cheese of course."}
{"text":"Wow...was I impressed with this place! Such a quaint spot in the Dilworth/SouthEnd area. We popped in here on a Friday evening and were lucky enough to snag a table on their patio. The patio...let's talk about that for a moment. Kudos to them for creating a patio that is actually really big but feels so intimate. Great place for a date night!! We tried a few different wines and also had a couple dishes too. All fantastic! They also do craft beer here so you can still enjoy this place if you aren't a wine drinker. The staff is super friendly and a big shout out to Eileen the bartender and Elaina, our server. You rock!!! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Had an awesome Malbec made exceptional by the bar in the garden. What a great way to spend a Spring afternoon - or any afternoon!"}
{"text":"This place has it all- great wine, awesome atmosphere and yummy food! My friend and I came here for a girls dinner last night and had a great experience. We started off with a bottle of wine (a 2014 tuscan) for $35 (no corking fee) and it was fantastic. We also had the medium charcuterie, the burrata and the flatbread.  The charcuterie board was HUGE. We got the medium (2 meats, 2 cheeses) and the portions they gave us were very large which made it well worth the price. We had the prosciutto, sopressata, the herbed goat cheese and some sort of truffle cheese that was INCREDIBLE. Everything was very high quality. The burrata was also delicious and refreshing, served over pesto with cherry tomatoes and greens.   The flatbread was probably my least favorite item but it still tasted good. I just thought it was a little over-complicated and very small. The bread was also just alright- it didn't seem super fresh. Other than those two things our experience was wonderful and I definitely planned on going back! I highly recommend this place and the patio is gorgeous."}
{"text":"What a cool spot and can't wait to take my friends who come in town here. Loved the vibe, my dish, my wine, and just relaxing on their patio. The place is comfortably casual, yet offers a more upscale cuisine. We got lucky and somehow got the owner as our server, and went with the special which was a light pasta with artichokes & mushrooms. No surprise that it was delicious. Everything was great and I even took a splash from an ill tempered koi fish. Right back at ya buddy. So glad my wife and I found Dilworth's, the perfect place for a drink on date night."}
{"text":"I had heard such good things about this place, so I decided to check it out and scheduled a happy hour there. I ended up not being impressed by it.   Most people complained about the drink prices which isn't that surprising. They did seem to think the wine wasn't good enough to justify the price.   I was looking for something to eat and from what I saw that people ordered, the price of the food was also not justified for what you got. We ended up getting the grande meat and cheese board to share with 5 people. It was good and a pretty decent size, but I don't think it was worth $50.   All in all, this place is going for upscale and that is definitely the vibe it had. Wine enthusiasts would probably enjoy it, I just don't think it's worth it and probably wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Dilworth Tasting Room's grand opening on 1/11 was a huge success, and I can't wait to take the Lady back for date night.  Parking will be a little bit of an issue, but you're likely to find street parking if you circle around enough side streets. The space itself is beautiful and open, with modern lighting and plenty of seats for lounging around. I met up with another yelper over a bottle of white wine that they chilled for us and we sat at the bar. We had multiple people coming to check in on us, and with the exception of getting the check (no fault to assign here, it was their first day!), things were absolutely provided in a timely manner. For a quick bite, we ordered the Espana (there was no tilde over the n, give 'em grief and pronounce it incorrectly ;) ) which was basically like an adult pizza sandwich over a small salad. Flavors were on point, but a tiny bit greasy. Oh well, #pizzalyfe.  With a huge selection of bottles of wine to choose from, as well as an impressive beer selection with everything from Bud Light to La Fin Du Monde as well as other internationals, Dilworth Tasting Room is absolutely a place where I'll return to try more things. It's nice to have a lounge type place move into brewery heavy south end, and I totally look forward to seeing DTR thrive!"}
{"text":"Embarrassed for this new establishment...we were..and are all hoping to be a big success.  Tonight there was not enough help, inattentive bartenders, slow iPads, no one tending the wine selections and the list goes on.  Best part is the serene courtyard that will manifest itself many times over. Good luck."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this open concept wine spot in Dilworth. Went on a Monday evening so parking was not an issue and we were one of three other couples there. Sat on one of the red couches which was comfortable and enjoyed several different wines. They have an array of choices as well as other beverages than wine, but we obviously wanted wine considering this is a wine bar.   We ordered the truffled cheese baguette which was like a glorified fancy grilled cheese! Very tasty. We also shared the two cheeses and two meats plate which was plentiful.   Service was friendly, helpful with wine selections, as well as their food menu, and they kept the place open a bit longer after they officially closed.   Great for groups as well as small one on one dates."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this cozy beauty and I couldn't have been more pleased. The food was excellent and the wine was fabulous. I encountered a server by the name of Zach. Although he wasn't too familiar with wine, he gave me the best information he could and honestly helped me tremendously. I definitely highly recommend this beautiful place! Thanks Zach!"}
{"text":"Shockingly bad experience.  Service was terrible the whole evening and when members of our party commented on the bad service and asked for better, they were kicked out.  In fact, I think there was even a bizarre threat that the whole group would be kicked out.  It seemed like a juvenile response to a reasonable complaint.  We were there for a 40th birthday party and probably would have spent a lot of money, but no one was drinking because service was hard to come by.  Though the setting is beautiful, there are better places in Charlotte with more respectful/more attentive service.  Skip this one."}
{"text":"Went on a whim with my work colleagues and sat outside. Our waitress was very friendly and knowledgeable and we relied on her all night. Delish wine flights (3 whites for $20, reds for $25...no matter how expensive per glass!)), snacks, and a few beers. The outdoor patio is beautiful and you feel like you are in a completely different place - almost like a vineyard (shocking, huh?). The best thing I can say is that before I knew it I had been there for 3 hours. Cannot wait to come back."}
{"text":"Great wine and cocktail menu.  Appetizers and  cheese/salumi combinations selections are impressive.   Cannot try them all in one visit,  so will have to come back!"}
{"text":"Definitely a hip vibe w a cool decor and ambiance and for that 3 stars. Only tasted one wine and didn't make use of the daily special. Points off due to food-- was bland, tasteless :( I tried a few dishes - 5 cheese sandwich - needs salt or something ?, flatbread-- which was so small, flavors were not worth any calories didn't come together, and zucchini dish. So disappointed bc I love small dishes or tapas style plates etc. the patio did look like a fun place to relax but all and all not worth a revisit"}
{"text":"Finally tried Dilworth Tasting Room last week and I loved it! We were able to snag the big table in the back of the patio. I felt like I was in the Secret Garden with all the greenery; it was beautiful! Our server was very prompt and knowledgeable of the wines. She brought  me several tastes of wine she thought I would like based on what I described to her. I loved everything she brought me and ended up getting a glass of the Tank Garage, a butter chardonnay from California.   We also ordered some food - I had the Rosted Grapes Bruschetta and the Espana Flat Bread. Both were fresh and had excellent flavor.   The only reason I give 4 stars and not 5 is that the parking situation can be challenging. You're limited to street parking, which is limited itself. We also notices that our server got really busy as the place filled up and we had a hard time getting our checks.  I will definitely be back! If you are looking for a unique and great wine experience, this is it!"}
{"text":"This place was such a nice surprise! Sari A and I were on the hunt for something to do on a Sunday night and this tasting room was open until 8 p.m.. We walked in and the tasting room was completely empty. Thankfully, the server recommended for us to go outside on the patio, which was where everyone else was.   I'm sure my eyes lit up when I walked out to the patio, it was utterly charming. There were heaters set up around the pond and spaced evenly between the tables. There was relaxing music playing and I quickly began to feel relaxed myself (the heater behind me didn't hurt!).   Our server was friendly and extremely knowledgeable about the wines. We thoroughly enjoyed our wine and experience!"}
{"text":"What a great addition to the the Charlotte scene.This wine bar/lounge is very open and relaxing with a nice mix of younger and older people. They have a great selection of wines and offer a good selection of beer if you need to switch it up. You can go pick a bottle of wine from the rack and have them open it up for you or can order from their wine by the glass menu.   We went with a group on a Saturday night and had an incredible time. Seating is first come first serve but the staff is incredibly accommodating when the place is full. If you can't get a table or couch, the bar area is nice and open and there is a big standing room area too. There is also a good looking patio that will be great when the weather allows it to be used. The owner Chadford is also very nice and accommodating and really interested in making sure we had a good time. This is a great place to hang out and we'll definitely be making this one of our regular spots."}
