{"text":"Coming back from red Rock Canyon on 5/4/11, we happened upon an all you can eat sushi restaurant that was exceptional, all you cared to eat for 19.95 a person, ordered off the menu and prepared fresh.  The waitress and manager were very friendly as well and came to the table often to see if we wanted more and make sure everthing was fine.  This was Nagoya, 5025 S. Fort Apache Rd #101, highly recommended, and we know good sushi!!"}
{"text":"This place is cheaper than other Markham AYCE locations generally especially with the coupon from the newspaper. Although they do have a fewer selection And the quality of the rolls isn't that great either really... If you're only going for a good dose of sashimi though I'll highly recommend it !!"}
{"text":"Yum did you say sushi?   I ate here with my bf on a Friday night and I have to say that I was a bit impressed since I love sushi. That being said they have a variety of rolls (all sound so yummy), a huge AYCE menu, and I didn't have to wait to be seated. Of course I did the AYCE since I love getting my grub on.   Now to the food...  Cajun Albacore (Good, but too much rice)  Octopus (I love octopus and that's that, too much rice though)  Red Bull Roll (half order, loaded with flavor and has a kick to it)  Popcorn Lobster (one of my favorite rolls, yes it's that good)  Screamin O (must try)  Tempura Green tea Ice cream   I'd definitely come back to this place and totally recommend this spot to the sushi lovers. Prices are good, service was good, and food was delicious."}
{"text":"This is my third time coming here thinking that things would change every time but all I've ever said about this place is...worst service ever. The service was really slow... The quality of the food is not up to par with other AYCE sushi places. I asked for a cola and received a dirty cup along with it. The waiter did not seem happy to be there and ignored us until we asked where our other dishes were. 10% gratuity is automatically added to the bill!! No wonder they give horrible service. I felt sick right before paying. Never again."}
{"text":"This has been my go to AYCE Japanese place for a long time now.  They renovated and the place looks great. The food is also very good, always fresh.  The service is as good as can be said with only 3 servers on a a busy weekend.  They try very hard to get your orders.  The price is average so no complaints there.  Their sashimi is fresh,  all their foods are good. Order anything on the menu and you will be satisfied.  The clientele are sometimes very annoying though, young people who are rude to the servers. However the regulars are very patient and mostly accommodating with the wait for a table and waiting to give their orders.   Overall I will continue to visit this place!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious, but I hardly ever go to Japanese places because the portions are microscopic for my big gas tank. $20 on lunch and still hungry."}
{"text":"The only thing I liked about this sushi bar was the size.  It is very large.  Custom rolls were weak, freshness was questionable and the price was way to high.  Have not been back."}
{"text":"It saddens me to write this review - it really does...  Hubby and I went here for date night recently and we were so disappointed I almost wanted to cry..  A little history first...  We stumbled into this establishment within a week of opening back in 2005 and instantly fell in love with the owners - still beyond friendly to this day  - and the teppanyaki room.  No matter when we went, you know whichever chef was working was going to give a great show with delicious food made with high quality ingredients...  We moved quite some distance away and our visits became less frequent but we still always looked forward to visiting whenever possible.  We went earlier this year and their standards definitely dropped but I just thought it was a bad night - nothing bad enough to give a bad yelp review for.  Unfortunately that was not the case...  Well, on our most recent visit when I saw no one in the room at 6:45ish on a Friday night - that should have been Clue #1 that it was going to be bad.  Clue #2 should have been that their grills were cold and it took a half hour to heat up - who know when the last time they were used.  Clue # 3 was when I asked if I could have grilled shrimp instead of chicken with my ribeye and was told no - that has never been an issue before in 5 years.  Got the soup and it changed from before - no more amazing miso broth with delicate mushrooms and onion slivers - it was hard chunks of tofu in a indescriable in not a good way cloudy broth that tasted rancid.  Then onto the salad - what used to be a nice mix of microgreens is now iceburg lettuce salad in a bag - and a teaspoon (if that) of bottled past its prime dressing - yippee (not)!  When you are paying over $30 a piece for dinner - please at least make an effort to make it less \"bag-like\".  Now onto dinner ... after waiting forever for the grill to warm up - we were starving and looking foward to the \"show\"...  The chef (you could tell he did not do this very often) - couldn't even get his matches lit - after a while he gave up and started cooking the veggies (he put them in a very big dice and they were barely warm - they were tough and rubbery - not fresh at all).  He then made the rice and it had zero flavor and barely any veggies or egg in it.  It just didn't taste good at all. Then he placed the ribeye (which I asked for medium rare), chicken and shrimp on the grill all together - he burned the shrimp, and the steak was so tough, well done and tasted off - I couldn't eat it.  His flair skills were horrible too and we did not have a good time.  At that point we just wanted the check and wanted to go home.    We never left hungry from Nagoya before and we were both very disappointed and I felt sick to my stomach.  The only reason this is getting a two star rating is because the owner and the servers are still beyond friendly and nice and were very happy to see us.  I  noticed this place has mainly turned into an AYCE sushi place - unfortunately it was at the expense of what we felt was the best teppanyaki place in Vegas.  I know the owner is trying to keep two restaurants afloat in this horrific economy - but maybe shutter one of them and bring the quality back to the one remaining.  We won't be back :("}
{"text":"Solid go-to all you can eat spot. Service is a little shoddy. But it's to be expected. Order a LOT!"}
{"text":"Best. Sushi. Restaurant. Ever. (at least in the Markham/Scarborough area)  The decor and food is amazing and price is very low but the selection is what separates this place from the rest. The menu is huge and every single item is delicious.  It's an AYCE place and the sushi is some of the best I've ever had, California and Spicy Salmon rolls are solid. Kobe and Nagoya rolls are must tries as well as anything with avocado in it.  Pretty much tempura anything and all the soups and sides you could imagine. The appetizers are their bread winners. Best thing on the menu is steak teriyaki which is actually pieces of steak cooked medium rare!  Teriyaki chicken is no joke either, and the green onions wrapped in beef are awesome too.  They have seafood and a bunch of deep fried/breaded options which are all light and crispy and not greasy at all.  Pretty much try whatever you like on their huge menu and see what you like, you can't go wrong,"}
{"text":"Yesterday I had gone to eat AYCE sushi here for the third time. They were all good experiences.  One thing I always get here is the squid teriyaki. It's been consistent.  Their sashimi was good and the rolls did not have toooo much rice. We all hate too much rice right? Now,I know everyone wants to know about dessert to end their meal with: they got green tea, red bean and mango ice cream. Mango yogurt, Japanese almond tofu, banana split and banana pancake. (Did not have banana yesterday).  They have a large variety of foods. I posted a picture of the menu and prices. Cash discount."}
{"text":"This is for the Rainbow/Windmill location!  I live down the street and come once every 1-2 weeks =) their dynamite is bomb! haha their super white tuna nigiri was very fresh, i ate 4 orders of it! garlic edamame is original and yummy, i've never seen it before. i've heard the ft. apache location was not that good but i've seen a coupon for it that listed both addresses so it must be the same owner?? 4 stars!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times over the past few years as well and this place is one of my family's favourite spots to go for Japanese buffets. My family and I have never once had food poisoning here before and the owner is always very friendly. Service can be a bit slow sometimes but I am not surprised since 10% tip is already included on the bill. I also don't like the lack of parking due to the popularity of a Chinese restaurant in the same plaza.   Often times you can also look in the Chinese newspapers or magazines for a coupon to cut out and use for this restaurant. Overall I would definitely recommend this place and come here again."}
{"text":"The quality of the food here is good. Their shrimp tempura is really good. Their steak and chicken teriyaki are good too. They have a  wide selection of dishes and are reasonably priced for an ayce sushi place. The service can be a little better, in the sense that they take forever to return to do a second round of orders. I usually order everything I want the first time around."}
{"text":"Lunch AYCE for $11.95?! You might think: How good can it be? Actually it is quite nice - for this price. Their menu includes a large selection of sushi, rolls, as well as appetizers. (over 150 items!) Love the Hokkaido Ramen (which is made with real salmon fish stew and guaranteed no MSG in it), spicy salmon sushi (spicy without the sour after taste), and teriyaki beef short ribs (not over-cooked and very tender and juicy). Also there is always a decent amount of fish on the sushi. During lunch hour it could get a bit crowded and loud. Food still comes fast, but the server sometimes doesn't get to you as quickly. (Try avoiding lunch hours) I've been to this restaurant almost every other week - For sushi AYCE, it is probably the best value"}
{"text":"it's been my husband's favorite sushi place since 2007. this place is no longer what it used to be since it last changed ownership.  i ordered shrimp tempura and sweet potato tempura. they served me the latter and another sweet potato cut in the form of shrimp?!!! i thought it was an error but when i look  closely that sweet potato was indeed cut with  a tail form and curved body.  so i politely told the server we ordered shrimp tempura and did not get it. and she brought the real deal thereafter. conclusion is: yeah they do try to stuff you up with starch by any means possible. lol. the best joke of the year. if they plan on running their business with such lack of honesty.. they are not getting my business anymore. the last two times we went there i have been telling my hubby it is no longer the same and that we should stop going there. that shrimp tempura sealed the deal for me.   grilled eggplant was deep fried and burnt. chicken wings were deep fried and burnt.  not to mention that my mom overheard the chef/cook make a nasty comment about \"hakka yan\". dude you should not make any such narrow minded comments. if you think your people is so superior.. pack your bags and go back there.  business has unethical practice and does not reflect canadian values."}
{"text":"So my team and I (about 7 people) got there at prime time @12:30 pm, ended up leaving 2.5 hours later at 3pm and only got about half the food we ordered. Didn't even feel like a real buffet as we barely had enough to feel satisfied. They took over 30 minutes just to bring us the first plate and only brought a small amount of food each time. I suspect that some of our food was given to adjacent tables. Given the huge amount of time to order food I ended up ordering dessert in the middle thinking it'd take about an hour to be fulfilled but they brought it right away.   Gave them an extra star since the food tasted pretty good especially the yam tempura."}
{"text":"I came here on saturday night around 7:30pm with a party of 8 for my friend´s birthday and the place was completely packed so I highly recommend making reservations on weekends. We ordered a sushi boat to share (sashimi, sushi and maki) the sashimi was melt-in-your-mouth good, fresh, cold and absolutely YUMMY. The grilled food was really good too. They have a great selection of rolls, sashimi, tempura and cooked foods. Service was kinda rude coming from an asian waitress maybe because she doesn´t speak english at all and she couldn´t understand what we were saying, but the others young waiters they were very good and friendly and the owner was super nice trying to make us feel very comfortable. Definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"This is an AMAZING restaurant. The food and the pricing simply doesn't correlate.  Very cheap prices for some of the best  sushi in Vegas.  Way off the strip in Summerlin, the drive is worth it."}
{"text":"First time trying this place and was quite impressed.. Food was excellent.  Great selection and fast service.  I would definitely come back again"}
{"text":"Love this place! The prices are reasonable and the service is usually quite efficient and quick. There are also many different dishes to chose from. I highly recommend their green onion beef roll and shrimp tempura!  My experience with friends here as always been very pleasant."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite sushi restaurants.  The serving staff isn't great, very matter of fact, and most of them don't speak English very well (or at all).  The food makes up for it though, the best teriyaki salmon, tempura, and spicy salmon rolls around.  Great variety on the menu, though some fish substitutions are made hoping you won't notice (like just about every sushi joint ever).  The rice could be a bit more sour for my liking but very rarely do restaurants do proper sour rice.  Very minor quibbles overall though, we keep going back and every other sushi joint is measured against this one for us."}
{"text":"Can't say I'm satisfied with my visit. I've been to this restaurant a few years ago and had a great experience. Service and food was excellent. But over the years something went wrong and the staff are extremely rude and just aren't doing their jobs.   My family went to this restaurant to have a good meal, but instead we were standing at the front door for a minimum of 10 minutes. Not only did the staff see us three times, we had to go up to them and ask for a seat. Terrible experience.   After filling the order sheet, we were trying to get the attention of the server. Not only did he once again ignore us, he kept telling us to wait before he decided to take our order. The worst part, he WASN'T occupied with anything else. At this point, my family and I were both pissed and decided to go to another restaurant. When we told them, they said that the food is almost ready and we'd have it very soon. Not only did a few seconds later, they decided to give us food all of a sudden. IT WASN'T WHAT WE ORDERED! They brought out random dishes that were meant for assumably other guest just to make us stay. The mussels were basically frozen and the food along with the service didn't improve.   Don't waste your time and money, might as well go somewhere else. WOULD NOT recommend!"}
{"text":"Been here 6+ times over the last few years.  This place is Guu's for the hungry man. Go here for dinner buffet, order all the stuff on the chef's special menu. GF doesn't like raw fish, and she loved this place. Basically it's like an izakaya's but it's a freakin $30 buffet!   Protip:  - don't waste your stomach real estate on stuff like hand rolls and sushi. - afraid of raw food? Order fried salmon, beef steak, black dragon roll, and other cooked stuff, it's better here anyways!"}
{"text":"I've come here for years, always had great sushi and service for a very decent price. The most recent visits have been not as good because of the waitress's attitude. She likes to hand you the plates of food instead of setting it down on the table, when she wants to take something from the table, she will point at it until you hand it to her. Overall she just has a very rude attitude and it's not just a one-off event, everytime I come and she's working, she's like this.   It sucks that tip is automatically included in your bill because I wouldn't give her any. The other waiters are all fantastic though."}
{"text":"Waited for a few minute at the door and no one seems to notice you. I had to walk up to them after waiting 5 minutes at the door in order to get a seat.   Then after seated, I waited another 5 min but there were still no tea for us. So I asked them for tea and they just ignored me. Then I ask them AGAIN with a stronger tone and then they brought the tea to us.   After placing our orders, I've noticed a Caucasian couple walking in waited at the door for 3 min before having a seat. Then we waited for over 30 minutes for our food to arrive but guess what, the Caucasian couple's table was already full of food and we didn't even get a single plate of food. Like WTF, we placed our orders at least 15 minutes before they placed their order and they get their food first???  This experience has really changed my mind about this place. It used to be such a lovely place for acye sushi but nowadays it just seems like the place is run by brainless monkeys."}
{"text":"Worst place ever!  Sushi was horrible, too much rice, and 30 minutes in between rolls.  Terrible service, don't speak english...SUCK, they DO!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch and did not enjoy it.  They basically try to over stuff you with starch so you can't eat much else. The sushi had a little bit of fish and a giant rice ball. The beef dishes were really fatty and, therefore, chewy. The spicy beef udon had literally two little pieces of beef and the broth tasted like watery hot sauce. They only offer white tuna, which is a shame."}
{"text":"Do not go to this restaurant. I went here yesterday with a friend for lunch. The staff are liars, specially the girl.  We listed in the order sheet 2 of each but it came out one of each and some did not even arrive. The salmon belly they gave are two tiny pieces about 2 inches square each, so we ordered two more. After twenty minutes we followed up but the girl said there is no more but we were seeing some coming out of the kitchen and they are big pieces. When we call their attention to that, the girl said delivery just came in (???). Do not get the fried octupus and spareribs- very tough. Also, orders come out in a trickle(must be their strategy so you won't order more). They get 10% service charge, so $13.98 plus service charge is definitely not worth it. And so we left after  1 1/2 hour with half of our orders not even arriving."}
{"text":"I had such a good experience at this restaurant. I walked in and the interior design set a really good atmosphere.   Our waiter was very knowledgeable, quick and we could communicate well. He then switched out and the woman after was sort of slow.   It was such fresh sushi and the flavors came through. We didn't like much of the mayonnaise that was used in the spicy dressing on the sushi, but other than that, there was a tonne of variety and it was simplified for us not so aware sushi lovers of some food items.   By the way the green tea was actual loose leaf in the pot and tasted so refreshing with the meal, which also included a soda drink with the all you can eat price.   The price is self was reasonable, but with my friend and I, we were still charged gratuities on our bill before paying. I ended up tipping mistakenly on top of the bill but it was worth it.   Five stars for a worthy surprise close to home!"}
{"text":"We were around the neighborhood with some cousins and this was the nearest sushi place at night. We came in and there were 2 tables with customers, one was a couple and another was a big family maybe 9-10 people. We were 4 and they sat us down near the big family. We  were making our first list of orders and it was fine. A nice waitress took the first paper and we got 1/4 of our first order and as we waited for the rest an older lady waitress (different than the one who first served us) came to tell us to make our final orders because they wanted to close the kitchen (even though it was still 2 hours before closing time and if they wanted to close I feel maybe it was best to not seat us but of course its about the money) so we tried our best to make a second list of orders even without having the rest of our first lists food and gave that paper, The older waitress kept coming to the table and yelling at us to give her the menus back and the pencils. We got both of our orders in the same time and of course its impossible to fit two lists on a table so the waitress was yelling at us to move plates and such to jam all the plates in the small table, extremely unpleasant. While in the meantime the table next to us were being treated nicely and calmly, they even took another order from them after they served our 2 lists which were supposed to be the \"last call\", Shortly after giving us the food the older lady waitress came to take our soya sauce to refill for the next day when we did not even finish eating. Would not go back here ever, or recommend to anyone. They also force tip on your bill, I would have never tipped such a terrible service but I guess that's why it's included on your bill because they know they give horrible service and no one would pay to get yelled at all night."}
{"text":"I am not sure what to say, at first I thought we were in for a good meal. The place is small but nice. Very clean.   I do not eat sushi, my DH does. We both did get the AYCE as it is for the entire menu. I really should have read the entire menu. Down in the lower corner where it states no leftovers. I honestly did not know. Never have encountered such a thing before.  Not once while we were ordering did the server mention the leftover rule. We did not go overboard by any means. my husband did leave some sushi as he did not like one of the rolls.  The food was ok. For me the best was the egg roll and the fried rice. My husband did enjoy the other two rolls he ordered. One was crab.  At the end of our meal the server came over and then went on to tell us about the leftover rule. I had to ask her to repeat it as I was not understanding. We both felt like we were being scolded. She went on to tell us she will not charge us this time as it was our first time here.  We paid our check and left. We both felt so uncomfortable. Honestly we did not have a lot of food left. We did not even order alot. We did not order dessert.    Needless to say we will not be back.     The 2 stars is for the egg roll and the fried rice."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi places to go to in town. 2 Reasons why I choose to go here: 1. Price. Cheapest doesn't always mean nastiest. For affordable sushi that is still quite delicious. -and- 2. Popcorn Lobster. 'nuff said about this.  Just try it and let your mouth decide.  Although I like to experience other sushi joints, this place is def'in my top three. Especially if i'm in the mood for some Popcorn Lobster/Seaweed Salad.  Note: If you're not looking for some AYCE sushi, Do not come here. Overpriced when it comes to a-la-cart. Yet...super affordable when it comes to AYCE. Ehhh, how things even out right?"}
{"text":"I created my Yelp account just to write a review for this place, but I forgot the restaurants name... I was here sometime mid last year. Went with some relatives to this place, no one recommended us, we just decided to try the first restaurant we saw and this happened to be the one.  We came around 8pm or so so there wasn't many customers. We got our table and ordered our food. The food wasn't great, but edible. Everything was well except for the server they had. She was extremely rude. When she came with our food, apparently there was a pencil that was in the way of where she wanted to place the dish. She said \"pen\" and looked to where my cousin was sitting, we all looked over searching for a pen. Her tone kept getting louder as she repeatedly said just that one word. After 4-5 times of saying it, she looked down to where I was sitting, pushed the pen aside with her FREE hand and placed the dish down.  She did that later again, this time with the word 'soya sauce', apparently she wanted to refill all the soya sauce bottles since there was only 2 tables with customers left.  So my family is vietnamese/chinese but we can't really speak cantonese, and as we were eating the server came to say that it was last call so we had to make our last order now. About 15mins since her last call, she went to the other table and asked them in chinese if they wanted to order anything else...  One last thing about this place, the server started mopping the floor with a heavy bleach smell as we were still eatting our food.  **WOULD NOT RECOMMEND EATTING HERE**"}
{"text":"One of the best AYCE Sushi place in Markham . So many options and fast service . I love their salmon hand roll and grilled salmon belly. Will comeback again!"}
{"text":"Oh man, if you love terrible service, THIS is a place for you   For the record, I'm not a picky eater AND I never been to a restaurant where ALL the tables around you were also annoyed and dissatisfied. The first thing that threw me off was the mushroom soup my mom ordered. The mushrooms were stuck around and under bowl and nothing was in the soup ! How can someone possibly mess that up? Also, the food there isn't anything special, so I wouldn't recommend any of you to try it out. They also tend to incorrectly give the wrong dish to each table which always happens to be for the table next to them...I've seen that happen at least 20 times.  Secondly, I never been to a restaurant  that took an hour for all my orders AND then gave up entirely for my second order.  I literally didn't receive any food when I placed a second order .Thirdly, tips were already included in the receipt which of course ruined my mood even more   Although the service was horrid, it was very amusing seeing the customers around me complaining and yelling at the waitresses. Even though it's not their fault the food was taking forever, the boss really needs to hire more chefs and waitresses .. Clearly I'm not coming back here"}
{"text":"This ayce place has been a favourite years ago. I returned after 10 years absence. The quality appears to be different, but both cooked and raw food are delicious. Be mindful of ordering raw seafood that has a high turnover rate, we order a special dish, and the flavour didn't taste what we hope to be. Torched sushi taste fabulous for ayce  This is a fabulous cozy spot to eat, try not to bring too big of a party.  The plaza is always busy from other restaurants, make sure you arrive early to find parking.    Overall, our table found the cooked fare much delicious than the others.  Various variation of the beef is a must!  They ran out of dessert, except ice cream when we were done (Who runs out of dessert)."}
{"text":"Pretty good selection and decent food...only problem is the people running this place are very cheap and try to limit your selection of the quality stuff at every turn. Then they charge you extra if you do not finish your plate clean of sushi rolls you did not like. The F with that. Not to mention they have an extreme attitude and have high expectations on tip. Go somewhere else, put places like these out of business."}
{"text":"From 4 stars to 2 stars.  We used to go to this place, like once or twice a year, we went there Sunday night and we were so disappointed.  This place is now under new ownership, and food is not as good as it used to be :( Beef sashimi got stick together, sashimi not fresh, place was understaffed (only 2 servers for the whole restaurant), no one bothered to clean up our table so we got a pile of dishes on the table for like 30-40 mins, lots of missing orders, ordered \"nutella\" banana crepe and got chocolate syrup banana crepe, ramen noodle was overcooked  Thank God we got the 10% coupon, otherwise this will be a 1 star review :(  TL;DR We didn't get what we paid for."}
{"text":"LOVE the Alex 2!  Have tried quite a few on the menu, but the Alex 2 is the best for me!  Friendly staff, too!"}
{"text":"Service was really slow, only two staff servers. Maki rolls are too big and wrong proportion of rice versus fish. Salad dressing was bad. Would not go again."}
{"text":"The cooked food is amazing.  The sushi is okay. The rolls such as black dragon and unagi (anything with unagi) is tastier than the other rolls. It was really crowded when I was there so you might want to book ahead. They are pretty accommodating with the seating. The only bad part about the experience is that the female waitresses looked really tired and irritated all the time. I don't know if it's because they are overworked or their shift is long or what but at the end of our meal she forgot and left her tray on our table and she billed us more people than there was. But I would still go back for the food."}
{"text":"Went with a few friends for weeknight dinner and was pretty disappointed in terms of vegetarian options. The menu is huge and there was a newspaper coupon available for 10% off but in terms of leaving there with a full stomach, that's where they fell short. Service was relatively fast and all food ordered did arrive. Very small restaurant though so be prepared to be crammed in if you come when it's busy."}
{"text":"This place might have the worst sushi I've ever tasted.  The rolls I had lacked flavor and were heavy handed on the rice. The ingredients were very low quality and hard to distinguish amongst all the rice.  Their accompanying sauces were terrible as well and noticeably store bought and not made in house. I'm truly amazed that this place is still in business because it is just fowl. AYCE is probably keeping them afloat, but even that isn't a great deal because it's all you can eat shit! Albertsons seriously makes better sushi; my grandma who doesn't know/never had sushi could make better rolls. Understand my point? Their rolls are like going to McDonald's ordering a 1/4lb with cheese and receiving a 1/16lb with cheese and extra bun. I thought Kaizen was half-assed, but they look like Bar Masa compared to Nagoya. So this review isn't entirely negative, I thought I should mention that their Asahi beer was quite tasty. The only thing on the menu that lived up to expectations. Is there a way to give zero stars?"}
{"text":"My experience with friends on Nagoya has been very pleasant.  We frequent this place quite a bit because you can't beat the value for a nice lunch like this.    The rice on the sushi is just about right compared to others where they try to fill you up on it.  If you get a chance do try their Fried Salmon Belly...absolutely melts in your mouth.  The salmon sushi we get is quite good, not that fatty stuff you might get elsewhere.  It has a nice even marble do it.  The beef skewers are another good one along with the beef wrapped onion.   The owner and staff greets us with a smile all the time, we really think that this place is a little secret.  shhhhh"}
{"text":"There's really only one reason to come here: all-you-can-eat sushi. Even if you just want one roll and some seaweed salad or something, the AYCE price is cheaper than paying a la carte. It's in a strip mall, as is the standard in Vegas. It's small-ish with sushi bar seating and then a few tables around the room.  The menu was lengthy. There were a lot of rolls to choose from, which I appreciated. And you can order half sizes of the rolls, so you can try out more types.  Everything was alright. Nothing was bad. Nothing was great. It was average and mediocre. Not the greatest quality, but not bad quality either. This is a very middle of the road establishment."}
{"text":"1 Star for location and price, 1 because my Kamikaze roll was \"ok\".   There was no one at the door, so I had to sneak back to ask if I could seat myself although it didn't look inviting. I had called to ask I wifi was available, answer was yes, but unfortunately this didn't exist. Salmon sashimi was extremely thick cut. Miso soup came out in a bowl that was very cold; not the soup, the bowl. It had been refrigerated or something. Soup lasted 30 secs."}
{"text":"Honestly, if you love GOOD sushi don't do the All You Can Eat here.  At first I thought it was novel that the restaurant would make everything to order (and it is) however getting whole rolls limits you because you can really only eat so much. The rolls were really just average at best. There were no \"stand outs\".  But just an example of one disappointment - I ordered a roll that sounded good with soft shell crab in it, I think it was called the Red Bull. I have been eating sushi for over 20 years and softshell crabs for over 35 years. I know it when I see it. There was simply nothing more than minced crab stick in the roll.. When I asked about it the lady \"assured\" me that it was soft crab but the chef chops it up for the roll. Huh? It was not good at all. out of 4 rolls I ordered only one was really any good. Not to mention their rules that you have to eat all of what you order - no wasting the rice or you will be surcharged. Their sushi pieces had way too much rice (which is obviously their goal to fill you with rice).  Honestly... don't do it. If you know good sushi you will be soarly disappointed.   In all honesty I can't speak for the rest of the options on the AYCE menu, why fill-up on noodles when you can order sushi."}
{"text":"I went to Nagoya last night with my friend because one of my friends highly recommend the food here. however, it's nice to have 25 % off during the opening period, but I think the food wasn't good and I still cannot believe they charge me $ 2 for hot tea. ( wtf??)  the service was okay. Our Shirmp tempura has only two shirmps and two pieces of vegetables. ( I guess it's sweet potato and onion?)  The restaurant is owned by Korean i guess..I would rather to have BBQ here."}
{"text":"For an AYCE place, this place is decent. It isn't fishy like most places can be, but the rice was somewhat soggy. I also wasn't a fan of the cooked foods. The deep fried foods were a but hard and crunchy and somewhat greasy. The noodles were also bland. On the bright side, the raw items were pretty good for AYCE standards. I would recommend coming here if you are with groups when AYCE is an easier option."}
{"text":"We had the bento box; the food wasn't bad overall. The main concern is the customer service.  I'd arrived at the restaurant with a total of 8 people. Once we came in, we were ushered inside and seated immediately. We'd been seated for no longer than five minutes when a waiter told us that they'd mistakenly thought we were a reservation they had been expecting. Without much clarification, they forced us up and could only give us the solution of splitting us up. When we considered a different restaurant, their excuse was that we already parked,  and that it was going to be like this at every restaurant.  When we ordered and mentioned an allergy issue, they were reluctant to accommodate for us despite the seriousness of the allergy.  Also, the ice cream is included with the bento box but was not written in their menu. You only got it if you asked them specifically for it.  That was our experience. Needless to say, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"My intentions were all you can eat, but after eating a couple of nigiris which was disappointing because the size of the rice was as big as my fist!  I ended up paying for ala carte, paid for my bill and said sayonara!"}
{"text":"When I lived in the SW, this restaurant was within a walking distance from me. I loved eating there! Food was always excellent, good service & moderate prices. I was worried they might close soon, because this beautiful place was practically always empty, often I was the only customer there. Well, I moved from the area while they were still open. Sorry to hear they are closed now... :(( Probably, location was not very good for the business, kind of hidden from the view from Rainbow."}
{"text":"My friends and I love this place.  The food is always good and the service isn't too bad either.  Some of my favorites include: spicy garlic edamame (I copied this recipe and make it at home now, so good!), sex on the beach, grand canyon roll, red and red roll (damn spicy but damn good), boom boom roll, their lunch special with teri beef and chicken katsu, and fried bananas.    Really good stuff.  Fresh and flavorful!"}
{"text":"This AYCE establishment has a pretty fancy decor. Otherwise its your usual AYCE sushi restaurant. You got your sushi, makis, tempuras...etc The usual AYCE quality. Salmon roses were delicious! You can never go wrong with Salmon. Ice cream was basic but the yogurt was tasty.  Clean place and friendly service. Keep in mind that they charge extra for drinks and that paying cash will get you a discount.  Clean place, Friendly service. Surely worth checking out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Family of 5 for dinner Service was great and Sushi was amazing   Must try :  Loved their torched Sushi Short Ribs Stir fry udon     Tips:  Pay with cash and get 10% off!!"}
{"text":"This place exceeded my expectations in regards to the variety of food vs. Value.  Came here on a weeknight dinner.  $23.98 for adults, $21.98 seniors $5 for 3~4 years old and $3 for toddler.  10% off with cut out coupon from singtao. One dollar off if you pay by cash.  Now onto variety of food, some of my favourites, mainly listing ones you don't always see at similarly priced ayce Sashimi: sweet shrimp, ika, mackeral, white tuna plus your regular salmon etc Sushi: has blow torched sushi! Scallop, white tuna and salmon Rolls: has good variety, including oyster ones and soft shell crab spider ones, blow torched rolls.  Has cooked fish variety rolls, perfect for children or pregnant women  Cooked food:  grilled cod, skewered shrimp, mixed mushroom soup, takoyaki (actually soft and moist inside with a piece of squid compared to other ayce that has dried out kind), egg tofu.   Cooked salmon belly/head.  Really would have wanted more but didnt want to leave leftovers on the table Dessert: hot brownie with vanilla icecream, jap almond tofu (silky and light, very yummy!)  Food that i think can improve on: Nutella crepe ~ had no nutella, only chocolate sauce, crepe was fridged not fresh Soya sauce ~ too sweet Also wish the rolls would name what ingredients are in it instewd of just a name.   All members at my table had either allergies or on special diet and it was difficult to decide which ones to try without specification.  I know we could have asked, but that is a hassle.  Service The guy who i think is likely the head of the restaurant is pretty friendly.  He seemed happy and energetic the serve food out which makes the vibe of the service a good one.  The other older lady had long thumb nail which occasionally touched the food when serving.  This is common in chinese street food service so i learned to immediately avert eyesight so as to not ruin my own appetite.  I also enjoyed that the food pieces camr exactly as asked, no additional and no missed orders.  The hot dishes also came out at a reasonably fast pace, but keep in mind that we had the early round of dinner time so it was less busy.    Service to improve on: My husband's only complain is that the sashimi order came out too slowly.  All the hot dishes have arrived and half finished before the sashimi and rolls come out.    Environment: The walls and lighting look nice, possibly had a renovation... however, the floor was super sticky  with black grouts which gave a dirty feeling.  The front foyer really needs to improve as it had an old basement smell and cluttered, with what feels like dirty drapes.  The front is also stacked with dirty looking highchairs... hence the cluttered look.  The fake leather chairs were ripped which gave a worn out feeling toward the restaurant.  The steel plates on the sides of the benches were also very obviously dirty... again giving the restaurant a not so clean feeling.  However, all this i forgive them for because of the reasonable pricing.  However if i were to recommend an ayce to someone who has never been to one, i would hesitate to recommend this one just because of the environment.  I would highly recommend the owner to have the place cleaned like you would have a car detailed.  Declutter or hide the front clutter.  Jap cuisine should give a clean impression.  Let your customers not judge your food and service by the front or foyer of your restaurant.  The front looks obviously aged.. and like the rest of the plaza, the front looks dated and what can easily change are those food pics on the entrance windoes.  Colour of the pics have faded and adds to the clutter,  overall, the restaurant is not as dirty as it may appear"}
{"text":"Well..well..well... I've gotten take out here a few times. The time when I actually come in to sit down it was horrible. Never order the salad. I do because i love the dressing (at other sushi places)...it was warm and gross. Food came but we had to send 2 things back because we didn't order it. We got disgusted looks...like we were lying. Omg I hate this place but it's so close to my house it's convenient to order take out. Ugh... I hope another suhsi place opens up as around this area."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst Japanese place I've been. The miso soup was salty. The salad dressing had a very strong taste. The sushi isn't fresh.  The waitress was too busy chatting. We had to ask for the tea. They were spraying done strong detergent to clean the table behind me. We will never come here again !"}
{"text":"Nagoya has been in existence for a long time.  I remember when they use to have commercial ads on Fairchild TV with a Hong Kong celebrity \"Lam Ka Wa\".  Commercials have long gone along with it's status as THE hip place to be.  The selection was GOOD and the quality was good too, but has since deteriorated as other AYCE has sprouted in the region and the business has died down a bit.  The space inside is a little bit tight at times and it's simply just ONE general dining area with 4 walls so it gives a bit of a Noodle House feel to it.  Due to the size  and the setting of the place, there is a bit of communal dining if there's enough of a LINE forming.  As usual with AYCE places, orders/items will get misplaced and the last few times my FRIEND just kept ordering the same thing without asking them to check back in the kitchen hoping that one of the orders will get through.  If I was YELPING about this place back in it's HAY-DAY I would have given it 4 or even 5 STARS.  Those days when SUSHI was considered HEALTHY alternative and perfect food for Weight Watching Ladies.  It just goes to show how tough it is to do business and keep it reputable and successful on an on-going basis."}
{"text":"Never coming back! :-(  this is my review.. Ok how can I say this, my  sushi roll was tasteless. I have to say that the service was excellent! But not coming back. --- no vuelvo a regresar a este lugar :-( ESA Es mi critica... MMM el sushi no tenia nada de sabor. Lo si  tengo q decir Es que el servicio fue bueno"}
{"text":"We've been going here for many years now for AYCE sushi and Nagoya still offers a decent experience despite some ups and downs over the years.   Came here with a bunch of friends on a Saturday night because many restaurants had long lines. We didn't want to wait and we knew we could just walk right in and start eating, so we did just that.  So what makes Nagoya different from other places? I'd say it's one of the cheaper AYCE sushi joints around, they have a massive menu (not only are there a lot of items but there's some good things there), and oddly enough there's free soft drinks on that menu. If you're one who likes ordering all sorts of other things NOT sushi, then you'll like the variety here.   What is good here? I really like the tempura here (especially the shrimp), they are hot, fresh and crisp. Spicy tuna/salmon sushi are pretty good here and so are the salmon roses, and hand rolls. I also enjoyed the grilled cod and salmon head.   The sashimi/sushi quality is average at best but is passable. The amount of rice they use in their sushi and rolls isn't bad either, but it has varied over time. The last time I went before this the rice was really sweet and vinegary and I'm glad it was only a one off thing.  The place isn't very big so they are typically prompt in getting your orders to the table. This time there were no mistakes in terms of getting the wrong order, but it has happened in the past. I would also say they're pretty good in getting the quantity of items you ask for.  Keep in mind they charge you 10% already so there's no need to tip again, and paying pay cash saves you a dollar. Weekend dinner came out to $29.50 out the door."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty ayce spot, bit worn in terms of decor. Busy and crowded but decent service in terms of friendliness.   Not that fast with the food, however it was all well presented and prepared.  Good price point just nothing all that exciting to bring you back."}
{"text":"yum! but what assholes.. every time I come..the females are just nasty!!  the sushi chefs...absolute dolls.. they serve spicy garlic edemame here and it is worth the trip.. and the attitude.. the fish is yummy..pretty fresh..keep in mind this is vegas..there are no oceans close by.. order take out to avoid the nasty female haters!!"}
{"text":"By far, the best Sushi in Las Vegas - OK, so everyone says that about their favorite sushi restaurant but the only way to convince you is for you to try it out yourself.  We have been going since the day they opened and have yet to catch them without the freshest fish - and that's saying something being in the desert!  ya, there's other places where they have sauces and special rolls that cover the less than perfect fish your eating - but not here.  I opt for the sashimi or nagori - it's a must try!"}
{"text":"Nagoya, where do I start? This restaurant has been around for at least 17 years  - I WAS a customer of 15 years until this Fall. They started off at Bayview & 16th and then they opened the location on Kennedy. It was the same owners running both locations. They ended up selling the other location and focused on the Kennedy Road location. 1 year ago, I would've given this restaurant 4 or maybe even 5 stars - based on freshness, service, portions etc. However, it is now owned by new owners and it was quite clear the last 2 times I was there that the owners had changed & confirmed once we asked. Portions are smaller, service is SO slow, they even forget to bring items to the table, or only do once they see you've finished what you're currently eating. Some recipes are the same, but some have changed and don't quite taste the same. I was really disappointed on my last visit, half of what we ordered hadn't even been brought to our table and it was impossible to get a server to come by even for drinks or napkins let alone our food. I wasn't happy with the way the sushi was made or any of the maki rolls. One thing they were known for was their sushi & rolls - perfectly done, right amount of fish to rice ratio. Not the case anymore. Someone pointed out that they charge a service charge/gratuity - IT IS clearly printed on the menu - it's always been there. I find it hard to believe that other customers said they weren't charge - maybe none of you actually read the menu. Almost all AYCE or buffet restaurants charge a service charge or include gratuity."}
{"text":"I placed an order to go at Nagoya Japanese Restaurant once before. When I was there the last time I was told they do NOT have TO GO menus, but they do have their menu on their website. Today I went on the website & check out the menu. Called in, place an for 2 Dynamite. On the website the price is $6.95. But when I got there I was charged $9.95. When I asked them about the price I was told it was changed. I asked them if they had a TO GO menu. They said they only have the one online. Do they just come up with a MYSTERY price every time I go into pay?"}
{"text":"Been here a few times now , and so far its been pretty good for a lunch place.   I had AYCE sushi the first time , which is normal priced and normal types of offierings.  Nothing that stands out and goes WOW!.   The last 2 times i have had the bento box lunches w\ Teryiaki Chicken and Salad etc.   For the price and how quikcly we get the food it is a good value.   The miso soup is very flavorful and i enjoy it much.   I will continue to go here with my co workers for lunch.."}
{"text":"Nagoya is a Japanese restaurant that's close to home, and thankfully I've found a go to place that's nearby.  It's caters to both an AYCE and a la carte.  Beware that this plaza can be a challenge to find parking due to limited parking and popular Chinese restaurant a few doors down.  Nonetheless Nagoya has been here for years, their prices are very reasonable $25 per persons as we used credit card, however paying cash knocks $1 off per person for weeknights Monday through Thursday dinner. The interior is small, cozy, and it seems old fashion, perhaps outdated... but its clean which is key. They've got a great selection for dinner, most notably torch sushi, salmon, white tuna and steak. Nagoya maki, spicy crispy salmon, salmon belly, black cod, egg plant, short ribs, summer rolls, avocado salmon hand rolls, yam tempura were good as it wasn't packed.with a lot of rice. Overall presentation was lovely! And if you love desserts, they've got a wide range from brownie with ice cream to traditional green tea or red bean ice cream to banana tempura and almond jelly.  Price 4.5/5 Service 4/5 Quality 3/5"}
{"text":"I ordered some take-out the other night. The tuna nigiri and hamachi nigiri were excellent. Really good flavor, silky soft texture, good color. The Tiger roll was also very good -- shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, cucumber and avocado. The Kamikaze roll, on the other hand, wasn't that great. The eel in it was too tough and chewy for my tastes. Service was fast and friendly and everything was ready within 15 minutes. The biggest knock on this place is the price. With the tip everything came out to about $50. That seems a little excessive for a take-out dinner, but the quality of the food was very good overall."}
{"text":"With all the gazillion Japanese restaurants to choose from here in Vegas, this one isn't the cream of the crop.  I got the bento box with shrimp tempura (2 pieces?!) and rubbery beef teriyaki.  I think the only semi-redeeming thing is the Volcano Roll which was mediocre at best.  I don't think I'll come back anytime in the near future."}
{"text":"New owner and sushi makers this time when I went. Haven't been in along time and decided to try it again.  Quality of sushi is somewhat the same. There are some new special items on the menu for lunch and dinner. Prices per person definately went up 2 dollars.   Tempura was a bit on the golden brown side. But tasted good.  Seafood udon was nasty. Noodles were horrible. I ordered seafood it came out as beef. Wrong order.   Food came out in a ok manner. It seemed that they wait for more tables to order the same dishes then the would come out at the same time.   Sushi and rolls were ok. Not as good as before. The only decent roll was the spider roll. There were blow torched salmon roll but I could have done without.   Too much mayo lathered on top of the rolls you couldn't see what was inside. It seemed that some rolls were missing ingredients like the crab or avocado as well.   If you like variety, with pkay prices and don't mind okay food this is this place to come for AYCE sushi."}
{"text":"I came here but I did not have AYCE. I ordered a sushi platter, tempura, and grilled salmon. Everything was alright to me. The sushi rolls did not have too much rice and they were alright. The grilled salmon lacked in flavor to me though. It was drenched in sauce but it didn't have a strong taste. I was pretty disappointed in the sashimi as well. Some pieces came out really cold and icy so it was hard to eat. The restaurant was quite empty during the weekday afternoon when I came, and my group were the only ones in the restaurant. I did not have a good experience and I probably won't return."}
{"text":"When sushi is your favorite food in the world, you would expect that trying to find a new favorite sushi bar (because the old one broke your heart) would be exciting - right? First of all, it's supposed to be hard to find \"bad\" sushi. After all, if the fish is fresh the only factor left should be the rice - or so at least that was my perception until recently.   As it turns out, bad sushi has little to do with the freshness of the fish. Bad sushi is a product of bad management.  Nagoya is good example of \"bad\" sushi, simply due to the fact that management has decided that several of the factors that make up a good sushi bar are too expensive to offer. I understand that offering AYCE can be a financial concern, so I expect that some types of sushi are going to be offered on a \"one per visit\" or \"dinner price only\" basis, as many places around town will do. But what I cannot forgive, is not stocking those items at all.  During my visit to Nagoya, there were several of my favorite sushi offerings that were simply not available; some are not even stocked on a regular basis. So even though I was willing to pay extra for the sea urchin, there was none to be had.   And to add insult to injury, the salmon roe was not fresh (it was actually very nasty) AND they do not carry quail eggs - what?. The chef said they do not carry quail eggs (which are an essential compliment to the salmon roe and sea urchin) because they do not get enough call for it. Well I've been to the 168 market and I know that a dozen quail eggs is extremely cheap - so I say that's a crappy excuse, but one I expect from a crappy sushi bar.  Just to note: the sushi chef was actually great. It's just too bad he has so little to work with."}
{"text":"Food and service are top notch! Better than other all you can eat japanese places I've tried by far. Quality of sushi, sashimi, and dessert are also excellent! I read reviews before saying that the variety of desserts was lacking but I guess it changed because now there's also creme brûlée and almond jelly which are both of my favorites (I thought this was pretty nice since most all you can eat japanese places only have red bean and green tea ice cream). I would definitely give it a try if you haven't yet. Being a regular for a while now and it never disappoints!"}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday, and this place has honestly gone downhill. I feel like they just stuff their rolls with way too much rice, and are made really sloppy. The tempura and hot food items are decent, and service is a generally okay, but the place can be quite cramped if busy."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food. Price was fair. Will be back soon. The sushi was fresh and the staff was friendly. Place was clean including the men's room.   Best way to judge a place, visit the bathroom before ordering!"}
{"text":"For the price, this is a pretty good deal. Approximately $22 on a weeknight and comes with canned pop!   The rolls and sushi were good, the cooked food was only alright. But if you're just looking to stuff your face, then you'll get good value.   The location is pretty small and it gets pretty busy. Service wasn't too bad, average."}
{"text":"Very quick and awesome salmon sashimi. I came in and ordered and it was ready within just a few minutes along with the miso soup. I found the Miso soup a little salty as well as a previous reviewer stated, but it was loaded with mushrooms and other veggies which were awesome to see ... And added a great taste!"}
{"text":"Another good experience at Nagoya.  Went out for date night with hubby.    It was a bit disconcerting that we were the only table there....  Nonetheless, everything was delicious.  No complaints.  I'm still a huge fan of some of their AYCE offerings like the garlic edamame, and the mushroom miso.  It's nice to get a few out of the box options.  Other apps such as the baked green mussels and gyozas were great as well.  Sushi and rolls were fresh, flavorful, and rolled right.    We were pleased with all of of our choices.  The only bummer was that they were out of uni for hubs.  Boo!  They offer buy one get one free hot sake so they are only $3.50.  Yay!  We had excellent service, but, like I said, we were the only table there.    Top notch AYCE sushi in my book!  The price did go up - I believe it was $24.95 this time around."}
{"text":"This place is no good now - HUGE portions of rice in the nigiri, and 3 of our group came down with food poisoning after eating here.  The yakisoba and other appetizers weren't that good either, even if you ignore the issues with the nigiri and our getting sick.  Would not recommend, ever."}
{"text":"The menu has changed a lot from 2 years ago. They have torched sushi now and a lot more dessert options. Their salmon belly literally melts in your mouth. Definitely one of my favourite Japanese AYCE places."}
{"text":"I would prefer naked fish over nagoya.  I ordered a hamachi and it look all burnt and hard as a rock when I was eating it.   Im not much of a complaint but being a sushi restaurant.  Should you be more focused on quality of your dish and care how it would attract more customers??  I give it 1 out of 5 stars.   Maybe they will improve?"}
{"text":"I came here 2-3 times 2 years ago and I enjoyed the food and atmosphere. The price was also reasonable.  I decided to come again with 5 friends despite some recent negative reviews here on yelp. The service was great but the food was just... disappointing...  Salmon lover rolls are so different now, lots of rice and tiny, thin slices of salmon  Everything else we ordered was average or below average... it's sad to say that we will probably not come back again for food that we barely enjoyed"}
{"text":"Stay Away - Food poisoning! A group of my coworkers and I came here to eat at 7:00pm on a Friday night. We should've heeded the warning sign that it was virtually empty. Regardless, we decided to give it a try. To begin with, the waiter came to our table after we ordered some drinks and spilled hot tea on my leg. Then, they gave way too much rice with their nigiri in an attempt to fill you up faster for all you can eat (AYCE). Finally, they are strict about their time limit, to which the waiter came and reminded us. To top it all off, all of us got food poisoning and literally had violent vomiting and exploded out our bums.  Stay away! You've been warned."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of sushi buffets, but normally stick to the same two places. I decided to try Nagoya with some of my friends and I would say it was a good experience.   To me there a few things that are important at a sushi buffet, the variety of food, quality of taste & dessert!! Now this location didn't have that great of a variety of food, a lot of good sushi but not much else.. the food however was delicious, I enjoyed all of the sushi we ate! As for the dessert, there was basically nothing but ice cream and to me that is a disappointment!   The service was good, however, we were the only ones there. But overall, you could tell they cared and wanted to make sure you enjoyed the food. While everything overall wasn't bad, for lunch I remember paying up to $30 on a weekend to my knowledge. I believe they add service charge automatically."}
{"text":"I haven't been back to Nagoya in VERY LONG while and tonight's food was very disappointing. The nigri was overstuffed with rice and crap rice at that. The rice was so mushy and had a funny flavor, that when you tried to chew you felt like gagging. The fish was just not fresh at all, bland with a weird after taste. I finally ended up just ordering a shrimp tempura udon. The udon itself was good, but the shrimp had so much breading that wasn't fully cooked that I just felt sick after eating all the above (we only ordered 4 different nigris). We had just had sushi a week ago at some other place which was dang delicious, so our sushi taste buds were not off tonight. I'm sorry Nagoya, but like my husband said \"Grocery store sushi was better than what we ate today at Nagoya.\""}
{"text":"This was our regular hang out for Sushi. My Gfs and I used to here to have out little GNO (girls night out) and have our Sake Bombs after work. The staff is awesome, always making you feel at home and the next time that you return, they'll remember you or at least pretend to! The moment we walk through the door, the owners always approach us to say hi and even give all of us a hug! So sweet!  Food is good! This was the first place that I had my first Screaming Orgasm, the sushi not literally. Shredded radish with Tuna sitting on top and some kinda spicy sauce. It was my favorite then I moved onto the spicy scallop roll, yep, I heart it. After having their Spicy Scallop at this location, I now judge other places on their version lol. Another one of my all time favorites is Garlic Tuna, which is so difficult to mess up, and theirs is so YUMMY. If you order a lot, they put them on these large sail boats, it's real nice presentation!  If sushi, raw or cooked is not your thing, they do have a full menu of other non-sushi items like Chicken Teriyaki, Udon Soup, etc. Another option is their Teppanyaki. It's pretty good! MUCH, MUCH better than Bennihana and isn't as expensive!   Restaurant is very cute. You can sit at the sushi bar, tables or if you're having Teppanyaki, where you can also order sushi, it's in a separate room.  Ever since they opened up Nagoya2, we usually go over there because our favorite Sushi Chef moved to that location. Overall it's a great experience every visit to Nagoya, either location."}
{"text":"2.5/5, +.5 for service  Nagoya is one of the oldest AYCE/A La Carte hybrid sushi places in Markham. If you ask someone who's lived in Markham for over 15 years about Nagoya, they probably know that it's one of the first Japanese restaurants in the town (now city).  I've been here several times when I was little, but overlooked this place since as there's several better AYCE/sushi options around Markham now. However I will admit you can't beat the prices here; you can easily get an a la carte lunch box for under $10, which is very rare nowadays.  I recently rediscovered this place because my grandma had a couple of dinner events here and wanted me to take her for both lunch and dinner. I came here without much expectations, since I knew the quality won't be anything compared to the newer establishments.   During my dinner visit, I ordered the 20 piece sushi box. While the fish was overall good, the fish to rice ratio is way too heavy on the rice. I can usually finish 20 pieces easily, but I struggled mightily this time around because of the high rice quantity.  During my lunch visit, I ordered the 12 piece sashimi set, which was delivered via a bento box. The miso soup that came with it was very bland, while the salad was a little better but also quite plain. The sashimi was quite good, with the cut being decent except for the octopus (way too thin). Finally, the rice was also decent, with it not being anything special but definitely edible.  The ice cream here was quite good.  Service was excellent both times, and they were quite accommodating despite the fact my table was one of the only who didn't go for AYCE.  I'll probably only return if requested, but personally I wouldn't return here."}
{"text":"Love the AYCE sushi! I love anything cream cheese, and popcorn lobster was very good too! there's a great variety of chef specials!"}
{"text":"3.5 I recall a couple years ago, Nagoya was THE place for sushi AYCE in Markham - at some point having uni AYCE, a more extensive menu than others. Lineups were once super long but its decline is evident with its cheaper prices and availability. I wanted to love Nagoya again, since I have such fond nostalgic memories of this place. However, I seem to have something to nitpick about everything. Sashimi was quite fresh. Dynamite rolls uses freshly fried tempura shrimp and has a beautiful crunch, yet rice was packed too densely. Beef teriyaki or steak cubes are well seasoned but slightly tough. Tempura was often served with sauce. Many fried items were bland. Many house items were not available. A lot of orders were missing or served very late. I've had worse sushi and Japanese food for sure, so it was not a bad meal. For $5-7 cheaper than other sushi buffets on a Friday (cash payment), I am not complaining. I would however love to pay that extra fee bucks to see them step up with their menu, service and food - instead of opting to be the budget option."}
{"text":"Even though this is the closest AYCE sushi restaurant to my office, I really need to stop coming here. Once every 6 months or so I mistakenly forget how bad the rolls are and decide to eat lunch at Nagoya. I did it again today. Hopefully this review will remind me next time. Never again.  I begin with shrimp tempura and calamari tempura appetizers. Too much breading. Almost more breading than seafood. My next order was salmon and eel nigiri. Not bad. Next was a baked roll (volcano roll) and a deep fried roll (can't remember). Both terrible. I conclude with tuna and spicy tuna nigiri. Again, not bad. The decent nigiri saves Nagoya from the dreaded one star rating.  Final verdict: 2 stars"}
{"text":"This place has been opened for quite awhile. I use to go there before their renovation. The food was by far amazing when I use to go. I recently went back after they got renovations done. Seating is much more comfortable but the food has downgraded. Also prices are expensive even though it's a weekday when I went. They still have their amazing mango ice cream that's good. But there are much better all you can eat sushi places that are more inexpensive. I'm not saying I won't go back anymore but not as often as I would use to."}
{"text":"I have eaten here once and it was fantastic! We ordered a couple kinds of rolls, some with fish some without, both were excellent - they put some kind of sweet sauce on the crab rolls and it was exceptional! We also had some vegetarian tempura and that too was really, really good. Beyond that, the service was excellent, the waitress even noticed our inability to use chopsticks so she doctored them up with a rubber band to make them fool proof and it worked! I will absolutely go there from now on when I need a sushi fix!"}
{"text":"This place is very close to my house so I go there often. The staff is super friendly and the sushi is pretty dang good. When I first started going they didn't have AYCE. But in the last couple years they started doing that. I'm never disappointed and always very full and happy by  the end.   Order the RED n RED if you like garlic ponzu The Baked Green Mussels  Volcano Roll  Those are my favorites!"}
{"text":"Whenever I eat at Nagoya, there are 3 items that I am sure to order first: The Screaming Orgasm (Seriously delish), Tiger Roll (which is good almost everywhere) and the Red & Red roll (which is similar to Tiger Roll, except it's regular tuna on top but with a spicy ponzu rather than sweet eel sauce) These are my top 3. After I've had my fix, I'll start to explore the menu for other yummy things.   Now, although not everything I have ordered from Nagoya was good (there are a few rolls I am not a fan of) for the most part, I know what my taste buds enjoy, and try to stick to what is in the range of that. For instance, ordered a Nato roll once. That was a huge mistake, and I really think it was Nagoya's fault, I should have known I would not like fermented beans. My mistake. I had a burrito roll (not sure if that's the real name) but I found out I don't like deep fried rolls (too much rice). Now, anywhere I visit for sushi, I don't order things like that.   Over the years, I have noticed that, with sushi becoming more popular and more sushi places opening up around town and stepping their game up, Nagoya has been less busy than when I first started going there.  Sometimes I would go in for dinner, and be the only table in the place, however, it's always satisfying. The price is reasonable as well.  --  Went there just recently, and I am not sure if it was because there was a new sushi chef or what, but I was a little disappointed with the quality of the sushi (especially my screaming o) It just didn't do it for me; I've noticed the difference the past couple of times we ate here."}
{"text":"So I want to update this review. This is my 3rd time here.  1st time was well over a year ago for AYCE, then a few weeks ago for a lunch take out special (which was horrible) But I figured maybe I mis judged them and I should try the AYCE again.   So.... I walked in and there were about 8 other people there (not too busy). Hell I was surprised to even see that many actually.  They have 2 chef's behind the counter and I'm waiting patiently and I finally place my order. They typically stuff their rolls FULL of too much rice, so my first order was small just in case.  To my surprise it was a normal amount. I was beginning to think that they may have changed their ways.  The sushi chefs were a bit slow and I caught on pretty quickly that this was going to be a problem, because a saw a party of 4 walk in, then a few other small parties and a few people also sat down at the sushi bar.  For most places, this is great and I'm always glad to see that people are coming in, but the sushi chefs here were already so slow, now what are they going to do.  Well it took forever to get my next few orders and I started to see why. They were very detailed with some of the orders and I don't mind that, but ONLY if you can do that and do it quickly.  Other orders were SOOOO skimpy.  I enjoyed their sex on the beach roll but it's topped with slices of salmon.  The salmon slice didn't even cover the top of each piece of sushi, it was also incredibly thin, and part of the roll wasn't even cut into pieces.   All in all their quality was fairly good and I enjoyed my handrolls very much but I somehow knew this was gonna happen as it often happens at mediocre places like this.. I order my uni and sweet shrimp \"oh I'm sorry we're out\"  I WAS PISSED!!!! and it was on a Wednesday TOO.  (I happen to know that Tuesday and Wednesday are the best days for sushi because of the fish markets in asia, so there was NO reason to be out of it) once again they most likely didn't want to serve it as part of the all you can eat.  What's sad is this place has GREAT potential, and you can easily see that from the menu, the variety of rolls and even the sushi chefs. At one point I wanted to stand up and shout out how easily they are making this a bad place and it doesn't have to be.  All they have to do is work faster MAYBE put a 3rd sushi chef on, and don't be so skimpy with their fish. I understand cost and not over doing it either but don't be skimpy. There are PLENTY of other great AYCE sushi places that don't skimp at all.  This place is very very borderline  about coming back for a return visit.  I typically eat in 45 min I was there approx 1 hr 20 min.  That is just TOO long for just goin by myself.    Work on your speed Nagoya. Guests were comin in the door to give you a chance and you're blowing it and yet you have great potential."}
{"text":"Service is a little slow and not as many options as other all you can eat sushi places but you just can't beat the price!"}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 2/5  Located on 14th Ave and Kennedy Rd at the plaza with Fancy Chinese Cuisine. I went there on Saturday at around noon, and there were no parking spots. So, I parked at the community centre and I walked back to this plaza (sigh, the things I do for AYCE sushi).   [SERVICE] - 5/5 Our server was actually very quick & attentive. He cleared our empty plates almost instantly after we finished each plate of food.   [DÉCOR] - 3/5 There were quite a few booths, and they were very comfortable. Otherwise, décor was not too fancy as the chairs & tables served their purpose.   [FOOD QUALITY] - 3.5/5 Relatively moderate-to-high quality ingredients for an all-you-can-eat sushi restaurant. Sashimi was pretty good as it tasted like the actual fish, and not watered down with ice crystals. Unfortunately, the sushi rice in the sushi fell apart in a lot of pieces of sushi.   [ORDER] - 3.5/5 Adult AYCE Lunch - $15.98 (Cash Discount), $16.98 (Regular): sashimi was soft and relatively fresh in comparison with other AYCE places. Sushi rice contained rice vinegar, which made the sushi more aromatic. The sushi would've been better if the rice didn't fall apart in some of the pieces. Cooked food selection was pretty large. Sauce for the grilled meats was sweet and tangy. Tempura items had too much batter, but was deep fried quite well.   [OVERALL] - 3.5/5 Nagoya is a solid 3.5 stars. With the cash discount, that price is actually one of the least expensive ones in Markham for AYCE sushi. Overall, fish quality & cooked-food selection is worth the price."}
{"text":"No need for a long review for this place. Freshness of the fish used for sushi is questionable. And a fellow diner found a cockroach in their food, causing a quick exodus of clients. Never going back again.  If only zero stars was an option."}
{"text":"I have been staying in Vegas for a few months now on business and have tried a couple sushi restaurants, but i found that this was one of the best ones! The rolls are awesome and service is great! there is a kind of bad smell but i think its because they crank up the heater toooo much lol anyway i recommend there rainbow roll its soooooooooo good !"}
{"text":"Do not ever go to this place for sushi. I decided to try this place for lunch. Be prepared for servers to ignore you. You'd have to wave at least 3 times to be seated or get their attention. After ordering food water was spilt all over my chair from a server and nothing was done about it. They acted like nothing happened,  server didn't even bother handing napkins and she was well aware of the spill. After the food came, every different roll consisted of mostly rice and an extremely thin slice of sashimi probably around the thickness of 2 millimeters. I didn't really bother eating. The avocado was also turning black and rotting. Highly do not recommend."}
{"text":"i have trouble deciding between a 2 or 3 star. But as all my friends continue to tell me...do you really expect service and quality for ayce?    The good: - cooked food came very fast and most were delicious. my fav was beef short rib - spicy salmon rolls are great, so were a couple of other rolls  The bad: - they have ton of rolls but they name them using japanese city names. when you ask them what's in the rolls, the waitresses have no idea. - their udon noodles are not good and a waste of stomach space  The ugly: - horrible service. they had two servers for the entire restaurants and ours kept messing up our orders. only one of them was competent and she was so busy. - $22 for all you can eat sushi+tax+10% auto-added tip in spite of horrible service = dent in your wallet"}
{"text":"Went here twice now. The first time I came to this restaurant back in the year 2015, it was already disappointing... so I decided to give today another try because I expected them to improve over the years.   Today I went out with a friend since we were craving for AYCE sushi within Markham. So we decided to go here.   Service is terrible. They will completely ignore you and sometimes forget which order ticket goes to what table. If you ask for some napkins, good luck. They will hand pick and count how much napkins they'll give out. (one each only)  We came here and ordered our first starter as the Salmon sashimi since it's our favourite when it comes to sushi.  We ordered 40 pieces but it only came down to half of that. Sure. It's not a la carte where you get every piece you pay for but at least give us the number of quantities we want??? First bite into the sashmi, there was a piece of soft bone inside my mouth. I had to physically pick it out and then drop the bone on a seperate plate. Gross. Second sashimi is fine, then suddenly the third piece of sashimi has yet ANOTHER bone. My friend also had to spit out some bones on his pieces as well. Now it's clear we know the \"sushi chefs\" are not experienced.   We just simply stopped ordering and called the bill right on the spot. Got the bill, and came up to $70.83 for 2 people weekend price (Cash price) (Debit/Credit = adds $1 to the original price per customer) (Friday counted as weekend). I paid $71 and then left. Look carefully at the receipt because they sneakly added the 10% SERVICE CHARGE TO YOUR BILL ALREADY. DO NOT OVER TIP UNLESS YOU WANT TO!  I would give this restaurant zero stars if I had to. The only reason why it is a one star is because Yelp doesn't allow no star reviews.  Avoid eating here. If you want AYCE sushi, go elsewhere. There are tons of better options at Highway 7 +/ Kennedy Rd, Birchmount, Warden, Leslie, etc)"}
{"text":"Okay sushi.. Not my first choice.. Got the AYCE dinner. Ehhhh. The fish wasn't fresh, the staff was nice but inattentive. Looks like they have a teppanyaki area too, but didn't see anyone there, & don't even know if they still offer it. Not good food.. Just okay. Gave them 2 stars for how quick they seated us, & how nice the sushi chefs were."}
{"text":"Went with party of 9.  The 9th person have to sit at an added wood chair squeezed with the 2 at a table meant to fit 2.  The tables set up was meant for party of 8 max.    Food quality at this place are above average compare to many other ayce.  Love their Sushi and Sashimi.  Price are fair for the food.   Would definitely re-visit if I want to eat sushi.  Paid with cash for discounted price and 10% off."}
{"text":"This is a strange little place.  They advertise teppanyaki but the teppanyaki room is never open.  They have AYCE sushi.  The sushi is very good and fresh and we have yet to see a crowd.   You can also get everything else on the menu.  The staff is very friendly.  Our only complaint is the lack of variety in the sushi specials.  Although there are three columns of special rolls they are all very similar except for a few with strange sauces.  We have tried nearly everything and only about 1/3 - 1/2 of the items have received repeat performances. There are the usual rules about sharing and leftovers but they don't appear too strict here. We get the AYCE because we can share and try more items for less money. They will make half rolls on request.  We try to go here about once a month since our 7 year old loves her some sushi.  Our search for the perfect sushi place continues but until we find it, Nagoya will keep us fat and happy."}
{"text":"Nagoya Japanese restaurant is defintely great for lunch and/or dinner.  Their sushi quality is great, however their service is inconsistent. There are some days where I felt that the service was excellent, however there has been days where the staff has walked past various tables including mine resulting with a few potentially frustrated customers.  I will re-emphasize the quality of their food, I always have left the restaurant satisfied. They have many items on their menu, a great selection. Also, I will stress that their beverage cups are too small. They should definitely opt for larger cups, such a recommendation is necessary for an all you can eat (AYCE) restaurant.   I want to include that their sushi cooks are flexible. I recently requested for a shrimp tempura maki roll with Avocado on top (similar to a green dragon roll), even though it is not on the menu, the chefs did prepare it with no problems. When I was paying for the bill, the chef approached me and indicated that he is  willing to make any special orders. I feel that this is important to state because other sushi restaurants refused to fulfill my requests, incase there is a maki roll that you feel should be on the menu...simply request what you want and they will make it."}
{"text":"Love this place for their lunch specials & green tea tempura ice cream. Good service too. Close to work so my co-workers & I frequent this place, at least twice a week. Try the tempura green tea ice cream, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon for AYCE. Thinking it would be crowded, I made reservations beforehand but was surprised to walk in to a half empty restaurant. The place is quite small and the parking lot is cramped.  One of the cheaper AYCE spots I've been to, it was $17 for weekend lunch (or $16 if you're paying cash).   Pop was included (and its not your watered down fountain drinks - they gave us the actual cans!). Anyway, no sashimi was offered for lunch - figures.   If you love rice, then this place is definitely for you! Every single roll we ordered was 90% rice. The salmon rose we ordered was a giant ball of rice with the thinnest piece of salmon wrapped around it - much like a sad hula hoop. They had blowtorched sushi which looked amazing in their photos but we were catfished again - the sushi just looked very sad in comparison and the taste was very mediocre.  Definitely was not impressed but hey, if you're looking to grab a quick bite for cheap, then check it out? But there are infinitely better sushi/ayce spots elsewhere."}
{"text":"Just got done with a dinner box which consisted of chicken teriyaki, yakitori, and shrimp tempura. The whole thing was bland, there goes 15 bucks down the drain."}
{"text":"Did have positive experiences in the past.  But this last visit left a lasting impression for several days.  The fish must not have been entirely fresh.  I became best friends with my toilet."}
{"text":"This is my go to AYCE sushi place. Been coming here for a couple years now as it is only a stone throw away from my house.   The food here for me has always been great. Fresh and flavourful. The service has also always been quick and the staff here are always warm welcoming and attentive to my questions. I have tried several dishes off their menu based solely on their recommendations. All which were great.   The price is the same as all other AYCE places. If I remember correctly, there is no tax if you pay cash.   Overall a good AYCE sushi joint. 3.5/5 for me."}
{"text":"Once again another bootleg Japanese restaurant..  Being new to the spring valley area, I decided to try some new local digs; Boy was I disappointed with this stop...   I am 0 for 2 with Japanese joints on Ft. Apache Geisha House and now here....  On the surface, it looked like a good spot; nice ambiance, decor and location however that's where the compliments stop.  I ordered a chicken katsu & teriyaki dinner box. There were only a few people in the joint,( maybe 3 or 4) so I figured that the food would come out pretty quick. It took them 20plus minutes for them to bring my food out. Worst part about the wait  was it was cold!  AND THEN!!! The katsu was so thin it looked like they breaded luncheon meat. The teri beef tasted like it was sitting old meat rolled in kikkoman teri glaze.   The only thing that was worth eating was the few pieces of California roll that came with the box . This is the only reason why I didn't give this a 1* rating. Based off of that, I would think that the AYCE sushi might be tolerable. BUT since this is a Korean sushi joint they would scrutinize you for not cleaning your plate and try to charge you for any leftovers.    The only thing that came fast was the check and that didnt even come fast enough.  With so many choices on Ft. Apache, I would suggest you go somewhere else..."}
