{"text":"First time here, and will be back.  We needed a small accommodating restaurant for a group of 7. Well worth the trip from Hamilton,ON. Nice and easy getting in and out; just outside of Downtown Toronto Craziness and Construction."}
{"text":"A couple family members visited this establishment with a Groupon earlier today and enjoyed the experience so much I had to put a few good words here on their behalf. They did not partake in the seafood buffet but rather went for normal \"a-la-carte\" service.  I saw pictures of their dishes (both beef entrees) and it was BEAUTIFUL. The dishes were fairly large and full to the rim. By their descriptions, they received not only quantity but also quality. I was pleased to hear that the service was very welcoming, helpful, and friendly.   Establishments like these are truly making use of promoting themselves through Groupon. Without a doubt, my family is definitely going back to this restaurant in the future. I am excited for when I can visit this place and experience it all for myself. I trust my family's review entirely and that is why I am sharing it with you here."}
{"text":"This review is for their catering! We had Ilhas De Bruma provide their buffet service for a graduation party at home, and I could not have asked for a better experience! All the clay pots and warmers were brought in, as well as tables, chairs, plates, cutlery etc. Everything was set up beautifully, and the buffet was arranged authentically just like at their restaurant. The food was delicious, and they did not hold back. We had tons of leftovers and the food was nice and hot! The recipes are absolutely perfect, and our guests were completely blown away. We have had compliments streaming in for a week! If you are on the fence, just GO FOR IT.  P.S. They also provide a server or two if you need someone to help take away dishes, restock the food etc. We highly recommend this! It was worth the extra fee to have someone take care of everything, and allow us to focus on our guests. Amazing!"}
{"text":"My husband and I walked for one hour to get to this restaurant.  Based on reviews we had to get there.  They were just closing down the buffet and were in between lunch and dinner.  For a while we were the only guests and the service was amazing.  The two fish plates were ordered were delicious.  If we lived here, we would definitely return but highly recommend it."}
{"text":"It sucked!!! The food was cold and overpriced! It's $40/person on a Saturday evening. The desserts are not included. The food was cold and either too salty or not good. I don't think it's worth the price and I'm not going back."}
{"text":"An excellent little restaurant hidden on college St near Lansdowne. It almost appears to be a Portuguese consultant from the outside due to the signage. Inside the ambiance is conservative and well designed.  They have a regular menu,  but the daily buffet is the best value.  I have been here several times for same, and have never been disappointed.  I was last here for their Sunday codfish buffet,  where they have 15+ different Portuguese codfish dishes as well as roast pork and lamb,  all for $25! (not including drinks and desert). The best value is the Friday and Saturday seafood buffets for $35.  Make reservations or you will not get a table for the seafood buffet. All of this being said,  their regular menu is quite good,  but the buffets are a better value for the money."}
{"text":"I was excited from the moment I saw the buffet selection! Everything was fresh and the aroma was incredible! Wasn't disappointed with how wonderful everything tastes! Our entire group was beyond satisfied"}
{"text":"We went there for a Tuesday evening dinner, and it was essentially deserted. Over the evening we could count another maybe 7/8 diners.  That did not prevent the overall experience from being a very pleasant one. As you can imagine, the service was very attentive!  We didn't want garlic with our shrimp, and didn't fancy the \"Tiger\" shrimp. So, we asked if the regular shrimp could be done in Piri Piri sauce rather than garlic. They were delicious! They were succulent, not too spicy and clearly extremely fresh. We then had one of the \"fish of the day\", which I did not recognise, but it was good with a fair dose of garlic. The vegetables were less good - the carrot was still very hard and the rapine overcooked. This was followed by a huge steak, recommended by our server from the menu. It was perfectly cooked, enough for three people, tasted wonderful, again with a fair amount of garlic. The same vegetables appeared, and the order of French fries was a bit indifferent.  The wine list is predominantly Portuguese. We brought one wine of our own -$25 corkage and had a light Portuguese wine, again recommended by our server at a reasonable$50.  If you want a bit of an explorative experience which is still good, then try it!"}
{"text":"After searching for a seafood buffet in Toronto on google, this was the first hit. I've had my fair shares of seafood buffets in Asia and the US and this one is comparable if not better. Great value for the money and food taste great. This would be my go to place for good quality seafood in the future. Their wine menu is superb and VERY reasonable prices. Will definitely be back again if they still have the seafood buffets!"}
{"text":"After salivating watching every picture posted on Yelp, we decided to go satisfy our taste buds on Sunday at the moment they open (12pm).   The fresh prawns, clams, and seafood were supposed to pamper the first arrivers.   Being the second table there without making a reservation (you should if you arrive later or in a group) gave me enough time to freely wonder around the pretty good looking buffet searching for the good spots to attack. (I must admit that this was the first attempt of an AYCE Portuguese food I've ever seen).  I decided to start with a soup I thought would be a \"caldo verde\": wrong, it was a pot of water with shredded chicken, pasta stars, and a disappointing lack  of seasoning.  The roasted pig was room temperature (OMG... What a waste of meat).  Good I love potatoes because there were plenty in almost every dish, and by them selves too.  I liked the service, the fact that they gave us olives, cheese, and bread (although they might charged it as table service, who knows; I was being treated)."}
{"text":"This is a Portuguese family restaurant that has a regular menu and a seafood buffet on the weekend. We came to try the buffet on Saturday evening in advice of a friend. Reservations are required and there are 2 seatings 5:30 pm and 8:30 pm. We arrived around 615pm and they had a table all set up for us with a high chair. Service was great. The buffet had a great selection of cold and cooked seafood options. Lobsters on the half shell, cold shell on prawns, the same items were cooked and in a hot dish, there cold green lip mussels and hot mussels, fried calamari and cooked calamari, fried fish and some traditional fried items. They had huge Alaska king crab legs. It seems this was not cooked or treated for eating and came straight from the freezer. One of the legs I had was frozen solid inside and congealed. Possibly refrozen a few times or re used. The cold and cooked lobster was over done and very salty. All the seafood items were salted and over processed. The seafood paella and seafood pasta was good. There were some cooked vegetables, lamb, chicken and pork chops that was done nicely not over seasoned. There were also cold anti pasta type options and a cooked seafood penne dish and rice which were good options for kids. They stop replenishing the buffet near the end of your sitting 40-50 minutes before. At the end of our meal we did not want to see the dessert menu. Both adult diners at our table had an upset stomach after the meal. Overall great concept and presentation for seafood buffet but the quality and taste fell short of expectations."}
{"text":"There's no better Portuguese seafood buffet - always fantastic!"}
{"text":"Always like coming here for their seafood buffet, as $35 is a decent price to pay for Alaskan snow crab,  lobster,  shrimp,  and other Portuguese items.  I'm always a little disappointed with their chicken and other hot dishes,  as it's too salty and sauced.  Would love to see roasted Portuguese chicken on there,  instead of the gravy sauced ones.  This place opens early,  so by the time we got there around 8pm,  they weren't refilling the stations anymore.  Stand outs are definitely the grilled seafood medley and the cold seafood. Would be nice to have a fresh salad selection or dessert option too.  Staff are nice,  but pretty busy.  Over all decent buffet for the price,  but stick to the cold seafood as the other stuff is just too salty."}
{"text":"It's hard to find buffets served in downtown Toronto restaurants so after reading very favorable reviews of Ilhas De Burma , my boyfriend and I decided to try their seafood dinner buffet out this evening .  The gentlemen who greeted us and gave us our beer & water was nice and pleasant but was too busy attending to other diners we couldn't seem to get his attention throughout the rest of our dinner. Other than dishes served in their claypots on the buffet table, all the others like cod fish dumplings, deep fried calamari and popcorn shrimp were COLD!  I And the 2 giant shrimps I got from a hot bowl were mushy, a sign that they were not fresh..Good thing their paella (or at least it looked like paella to me) as well as the rapini/carrot dish were great, so that made the entire meal not too bad.. On the whole , I was disappointed at the experience and will probably not return...$39 per person for the buffet is not worth your money ..especially when so many dishes are cold.! Great ambience though, so maybe go there for it and have some cold  snow crab legs!"}
{"text":"We went to the buffet on Friday night. The Alaska Crab legs and the lobsters were fresh and delicious. They were intentionally served cold. That wouldn't have been my first choice, however, they tasted great, which is the most important thing. Plus, it was well worth the work involved. There was a large variety of dishes to chose from. I tried to sample something from each dish but there were just too many dishes. The desserts were delicious.   I enjoyed the passion-fruit mousse. It was very light and refreshing. There is a good selection of wines to choose from. The staff was always friendly and courteous. The price was very reasonable. The value was excellent. There wasn't one thing that we didn't like. We loved it all and want to do it again.  There could be some improvements made. The place is spotless and pristine and so is the atmosphere. Something could be done to make our time there feel a little warmer and cozier. They have a very nice faux fireplace on the wall but that's not enough. Also, I would like to have entertainment on the weekends. I know that all of this adds to the cost. Personally, I would be willing to pay more because that would add those missing ingredients to my experience. Either way, I am still happy.  *Here is a secret that can make your experience better.* Sometimes parking can be a little difficult to find in the area even though there is a small parking lot right behind the restaurant. Take note that there is a bike lane running in front of the restaurant. That bike lane becomes street parking starting exactly at 6:30 PM. If you can time your arrival right at 6:30 or 6:31 you can park right out in front with ease."}
{"text":"Yummy! Food was delish! The giant crab legs were kind of icy still but my bf loved them. We got the house white wine was good, we asked for water and they brought two small glasses of water after waiting half hour, for them, wish they didn't do that since we were spending good money there. Waitress never came to our table again"}
{"text":"Came here with some friends to try the AYCE seafood lunch. ($25)  First impressions on walking in is that the place is very elegantly decorated with a homely feel.  The immense spread had cod fish prepared in more ways than you can count! LOL! As you can see from my pictures, we tried almost everything!  A couple of the dishes were a tad salty but that could have been from the salted cod. The lamb dish was a little dried out and the meat was tough. The only peeve I had was the lobster was available for the first round when we went through the buffet and it was not refilled...  We finished with a nice espresso. The bill came to $190 for the 4 of us with a bottle of wine and a couple of pops and the coffee and tips."}
{"text":"This is a beautiful restaurant in every sense. Even the wine glasses are just right for the wine ordered. The Service was impeccable and the waiter both polite and informative.  The luncheon buffet is extensive and not expensive. The grilled Octopus was so tender and fresh off the (flying) boat.  Located west of Little Italy in an area of College Street not yet gentrified, Illhas de Bruma pleasantly surprises you as you enter. The locals obviously agree, as the restaurant had lots of diners at noon.  We give our waiter extra points. Although his English was limited, he was working hard to learn. He had been in Canada only three weeks. He is from Brazil. He selected several terrific wines for me and my friend. He'll go far! All in all, we can't wait to go back."}
