{"text":"LOVE this little coffee shop.  Their coffee is delicious, and they're food is always fresh.  Their breakfast sandwiches and salads are my favorites!  Even better than the coffee and food is the service. The owners are so friendly, and try to get to know everyone by first name.  A definite must go if you're in the area.    -Suzy"}
{"text":"Erika's wins an easy five stars. Everything about my experience here has been wonderful. I work less than one mile away from Erika's, so this is exciting.  Struggled to find Erika's at first, but called in and received directions from a very helpful gentleman (who turned out to be Erika's husband!).  Arrived at Erika's around 7:30a or so to find Erika prepping the little booth - her \"coffee dock\". I was not in any kind of a hurry and there was plenty of seating, so I found a comfy spot and kicked back for a few minutes.  Shortly after getting situated, Erika's husband, Patrick, arrived to help her finish setting up. He was bright and personable and even remembered me from the call I had made earlier that morning.  Patrick took my order for an Americano and (his recommendation of) a Breakfast Melt.  Employees of the large corporate/medical building Erika's is set within entered in waves and Erika was careful to greet each of them with a bright \"Good morning!\". I loved seeing the rapport between Erika, Patrick, and the building regulars.  When my coffee arrived, it was hand-delivered to me by Patrick. When the food arrived, it was steamy hot and yummy.  The whole experience made me feel very much at-home, despite being seated just outside the offices of Dr. Seuss Orthodontist! Certainly not my usual scene, but I'll be back. Regularly.  Thank you, Erika and Patrick, for some of the most genuine and kind-hearted service I've received - anywhere. I'll look forward to seeing you again VERY soon.   :)"}
{"text":"I love this sweet little spot for a healthful and satisfying bite to eat or just a quick coffee or juice! The service is excellent; I'm always greater with a warm hello, even when just passing by on my way to work (I cover as a dental hygienist for one of the superb dental practices). A big factor, for many of those employed in this medical building, is finding a place to eat that will fulfill all of the following: finding a place to grab a quick bite to eat (maybe to go), that leaves you satisfied, not guilty and where you know you will be absolutely getting a high worth from your hard earned money. I know whenever I stop by, I will be greeted warmly and feel welcomed. I also know that when I need to grab something to eat, that the quality of product here coincides with the price; I think we are all worth it!"}
{"text":"This place brought a surprise to me. I like how it is unique from the industry. Definitely come stop in if I come back to this area for work."}
{"text":"I love Erika's coffee dock - They have amazing coffee, fresh salads and sandwiches but the service that I get here is what keeps me coming back week after week! The owners who run this little gem are quite possibly two of the warmest and most welcoming people I have ever met! They always go out of their way to make sure that your sandwich is exactly the way you want it and they always do it with a smile!"}
{"text":"I waited here 10 minutes not a single person showed up this place is closed for all I know"}
{"text":"Their sandwiches are excellent especially the one with chicken salad. I like the fact that they ask you if you want your bread toasted - that's a nice touch. The sodas are always ice cold and the prices more than reasonable. The owner Erika is a sweetheart and goes the extra mile to make sure you are satisfied. A worthwhile stop if you happen to be in the building, on your way or from the dentist etc...."}
