{"text":"We absolutely love this place. They have the most delicious sandwiches. Their prices are good and portions are huge. This is a family business and they really care about their customers. When we eat there, they always remember us. They make their own roast beef and steak on site. This place is great!"}
{"text":"They make their own roast beef and it's legit. Great sub (hero) good price.  Far from me, but will be back."}
{"text":"Real New York style sandwiches at an amazing price. I was in search of a deli that wasn't a fancy \"bistro\" deli that gives me an argula shmear and fufu bread. And I found it, this place has big hearty sandwiches for $5! The staff was really friendly, first time there and I feel like a well loved regular. Family owned too! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Really good price, huge sandwich for roughly 5 bucks, The lady is so friendly, we will definatley go there again, went around 11am area did not seem too bad at that time."}
{"text":"I held a party for 18 people last weekend and had the food prepared by Frank's New York Style Deli. I live in Mesa and drove to Frank's based on the excellent reviews on Yelp and couldn't have been happier with the results.  Hannah attractively arranged an assortment of sandwiches (10 inch hot and cold subs cut into 3rds) which was perfect for our guests. All condiments and sandwich toppings were placed in large containers on the side. Some of our guests, originally from New York, commented on the freshness of the subs and generous meat portions....\"just like home\".  Hannah's new york cheesecake was a real hit too. I highly recommend this small family business. Pricing was reasonable and the special care given was first class!"}
{"text":"We tried Frank's because of the great reviews on Yelp! They came through with flying colors. The sandwiches were awesome. Beyond that, super friendly, which you don't find much of anymore. The icing on the cake was when we couldn't finish our sandwiches because of the very generous portions and we didn't want to throw them away because we were on our way to a game. The sweet owner let us borrow a cooler with ice. We've been back 2 times in a week and don't live anywhere close by. Try Frank's!! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"While working in the area I decided I would give Franks NY Deli a try. Pulling up I had to double check the address as Franks is located in a small neighborhood market.   The food is not deserving of the ratings here on Yelp as it is lower end processed meats and the menu is very limited with maybe 10 sandwich options.  I got the NY combo which is simply salami, ham, and choice of cheese. The sandwich is on a 10\" roll and you get the basic toppings of lettuce, tomato, onion, and dressings.  The sandwich and a 16.9oz beverage was $6.45 which is a fair price for what you get."}
{"text":"I love Frank's  They  have the best sandwac,  NYC HAS COME TO AZ.  Im so happy i live right across the street. If you want to try a sandwac try. The \" Tony\". Yummy. My husband love the steak sandwac , i have tryed the nyc stlye very good to, plus the meet balls and sauce  is good to but the Tony hit the 100%  list pf things i can eat over and over again !!!!   And the family is so sweet the ma' is so sweet and has a heart. That fills the store. And the sons are very nice. They have great personals  i go. There alot. And  help to go shopping there"}
{"text":"Hands down this is the best sub place in Phoenix, Arizona. This is a place you can call home. Mom and pops are the most wonderful people that you can call family."}
{"text":"Frank's gets 5 stars from me! Personalities are great and remind me of those that you find in a true east coast deli! Love the roast beef and would rather hit a mom and pop store than qt during rush hour any day! They always make you feel like a person than just a consumer. Thank you for being my neighbourhood market!"}
{"text":"Frank's gets 5 stars, GREAT sandwiches, friendly service and great prices. This place is definitely no frills but that's not what I want in a sub. I would give it 6 stars if they let me."}
{"text":"From the outside it looks like an old convenience store, in fact it's a small delicatessen inside a  small neighborhood convenience store. Everything is fresh and all there subs contain a LOT of meat. I took a roast beef one and my wife choose the turkey one, and we shared them. We both saved half of it for later, since that they are so full of meat. So don't let the outside looks stop you from getting inside. The owner and the employees are very sympathetic and helpful !"}
{"text":"A great hidden gem in Phoenix. I've started eating here about twice a week. The sandwiches are awesome. Great deal. Go."}
{"text":"My friends and I go to GCU and we get tired of the mediocre food there so we come to Frank's for some bomb a** sandwiches. We have been coming here for the past two years and we LOVE the sandwiches every single time. I suggest the roast beef! The potato salad was also prime. Not only are the sandwiches AMAZING, but the owners are super friendly and make you feel welcomed. 10/10 would recommend Frank's!"}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by it's cover! Great service and the best subs in Phoenix!  You won't leave hungry either!"}
{"text":"just dumb lucked into the place.  it's not fancy, but conscientiously prepared,  and delicious.  also reasonably priced and super clean."}
{"text":"5 stars.....good stuff here...all fresh meats and vegetables and bread...very clean place...family owned since 1972 they are cool people behind the counter ....will be back here for sure...."}
{"text":"The five stars is for the food.  You can find fresh, flavorful fillings at plenty of good delis but you do not find this kind of bread.  It's white bread... not a health food.  It holds the fillings perfectly and has a perfect blend of firmness and tenderness.   Super nice people getting the food out with a smile. I can't wait to be back into the neighborhood for another sandwich.  Extra workout at the gym afterwards, but it's worth it.  Yum"}
{"text":"Not sure what to make of Frank's. The meatball sandwich I had was darn good. Nice big meatballs topped with marinara and cheese. The sauce was flavorful without being overpowering. Also, the sandwich was good sized. The location and building are fairly poor. The place is kind of a sandwich line inside of a low rent convenience store.   If I go again, I will just grab a sandwich to go."}
{"text":"Frank's is one-of-a-kind. The sandwiches are fantastic every single time. This really is the kind of place that you can never go wrong with! Especially for GCU students, like my roommates and I- because it is so close. It's one of the best sandwich shops around. Highly recommend :)"}
{"text":"Food is so yummy! I got the Italian sandwhich, ate half for dinner and the other half for breakfast! Cheese cake is mouth watering amazing. I add fresh strawberries to mine when I get home! Thank you for good food! New favorite place"}
{"text":"We brought a group of 16 in with no prior notice.  They did an excellent job of getting us fresh sandwiches, pickles, and drinks while also helping their other customers."}
{"text":"I love this place! Their sandwiches are made right and taste really good. I've had roast beef, tuna, turkey, and club sub (combination). The bread is soft and you get a 10 inch sub under $6.00. It's a hidden jewel and definitely worth trying. I like my sandwiches to have more substance than gluten. This has everything and quality of food is great."}
{"text":"This place is great. My husband has gone here on and off for 30 years. We drive from Scottsdale. If you are looking for GF bread or sprouts this is not the place for you. If you want a sandwich that will fill you up and taste great this is it and for about $5 bucks. It last me two meals. And the nicest people in the world. The boys are so kind and polite."}
{"text":"Very rarely do I eat a meal and then move immediately to a review, but this place made me do just that.   The sandwiches are what you come to try and you will not be disappointed.  The sandwiches are 10 inches and can easily be shared, and they run around $6.30. They have a variety of chips, drinks, sides and snack options to pick and choose from. My total for NY style sub, can soda and macaroni salad came to about $9.40. I realized that I didn't need the salad, sub was enough, but it was also very good.   The family is very friendly and seem to know everyone that walks through their doors. I will definitely be back!  I was on this side of town for training and now I have to manage to roll myself back to the building."}
{"text":"I have been going to Frank's Deli since I was a child, some 20+ years! My mother would often have me fetch her up a delicious slice of Frank's New York Style Cheese Cake. I have yet to find any other Cheese Cake quite as good as Frank's. Years later, as an adult, I still find myself making those cheese cake runs, this time for myself. Frank's also has the best subs around!! &the best prices!"}
{"text":"was disappointed thought it would be a grate sandwich but it was no better then subway dry bread and microwave pastrami won't go back"}
{"text":"I've never been to a New York deli, so I can't comment on authenticity. However, great price (I think I paid less than 8 bucks including tip) for a giant 10 inch sandwich packed full of meat and cheese. Much better than Subway! Staff was super friendly too and it was obviously family owned."}
{"text":"Found Frank's on Yelp. Highest rated sub shop in the Phoenix area. Well deserved. I had their N. Y. Style sub. Huge meat portions. Super fresh bread. Great taste!  Could only eat half. Had to save room for the home made rice pudding. Was still warm. That's freshly made. Outstanding. My wife had a N. Y. Style chef salad. She could only eat about half. Very reasonable prices, and great quality. Frank, JR. and the family have had this store for over 37 year. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches. Great customer service. True New York style subs. Happy to spend my money with mom and pop type shops like this"}
{"text":"Awesome! Was recommended by a friend and this is cheap and delicious! I would recommend this place to anybody who wants a genuine New York style deli!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to Frank's today based off yelp reviews. The place isn't much to look at but the NY Style sub I got was on point. Fresh bread, heavy portion of meat and the price is fairly cheap. First time here but I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The best hands down From the people who work there to the food just a great place  The cheese cake ummmm and the tony was great"}
{"text":"All i Have to say is that this place is delicious and excellent in every way possible. I went in there and was greeted by a nice man and women who own the store and know what they are doing. They started a conversation with me about my day they don't get right to the business. Then asked me what kind of sub i wanted so i ordered a Hot pastrami sandwich with everything on it and wow when they say everything they mean it it was the biggest and most beautiful sub that i have ever seen. It is almost like they put love in all there subs and really hook it up. I LIVE IN ANTHEM AND DRIVE ALMOST 35 MINUTES JUST TO GET A SUB FROM THIS AMAZING PLACE. Hussam and hannah really know what they are doing and appreciate all of there customers and everything that goes in and out is of great quality. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of meeting Hannah, the owner, of Frank's yesterday. What a gem this place is. Located right off the 17, Frank's is a legit NY style deli with ridiculous food. The prices are incredibly reasonable as well. I had a roast beef sandwich that was huge. My coworker had a turkey sandwich that was outstanding. My other coworker got a NY style that was loaded up with everything. He's still eating it today. If you have the chance, please swing by and order a delicious deli sandwich made with fresh ingredients right in front of you. The customer service is hard to beat too."}
{"text":"As we usually do when we are driving through unfamiliar territory, I Yelped for suggestions. Today we were in the mood for sandwiches and Frank's popped up with FIVE stars. We had to give it a try and were definitely not disappointed. I would give it TEN stars if that were an option. I haven't seen that much meat on a sandwich in a shop in a long time. The bread was perfect and the service impeccable. I am now sitting here wondering why they can serve a 10 inch sub for $7.00 that would feed two people and most everyone else charges twice as much for half as much food with half as much flavor. I will be back."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and saw the great reviews. They were correct! Very nice people and good food.  Could have easily shared a sandwich, but happy to have the leftovers! I would definitely recommend this to anyone. Close to the airport and just off of the highway!"}
{"text":"Came here to \"test\" the reviews and I am NOT disappointed. Sandwiches are loaded with quality meat and the bread is soft and fresh. The owners are very friendly and service was fast. Yes, the location isn't the greatest but that won't keep me from coming back. You get a 10 inch sandwich for $4.99. If you don't like lots of meat in your sandwich, stick to subway."}
{"text":"Okay, okay...I feel that Frank's is worthy of an extra star for their rating...I LOVE their subs!  Once again, I was greeted ever so friendly, and sassily, from the wonderful woman behind the counter.  I wish that I would ask her her name...hmph.  She is awesome!  She asked for 3 sandwich orders all at once and didn't even need to ask us more than that what each one contained for extra condiments.  The subs always get hooked up!  If you ask for extra hot peppers, you get them!  And not just one or two, but several!  Again, the other customers that come in here tend to be a little bit shady at times, but then again it IS a liquor/beer store as well and is not necessarily in the best neighborhood (in fact, it is right in the middle of one with houses all around).  I recommend you try this place out for a cheap sub that fills the stomach and satisfies the taste buds."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Traditional cheap and delicious. If you are looking for an east coast deli this is the one. They are wonderful all the way around. It is very very good!  Highly highly would recommend a must stop for a quick sandwich!"}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp and based on positive reviews I decided to check it out. I got the pastrami and cheese and it hit the spot! Very good food and very nice people."}
{"text":"Top of the lunch box been eating here for years awesome best submarine pasta salads there's a small store for large drinks chips and so much more"}
{"text":"This place is hands down one of the best sandwich shops in Arizona!! They are the kindest people and there sandwiches are amazing!! Yummmmm!!! The shop is family owned and operated for 35 years and  the family is so kind!! They make you feel like part of there family as soon as you walk in! Super reasonable prices and since it kind of doubles as a convenience store you can pick up an ice cold six pack with you subs!! I mean come on how many sub places do you know of that sell 6 packs too!! If you live in the valley or are maybe just visiting this place is an ABSOLUTE MUST VISIT!! Five stars and a couple of insanely satisfied customers!! Thank you for being there and providing such an amazing lunch time experience!!! We will be regulars from now on!!"}
{"text":"franks deli is like billy d williams and a colt 45.... works every time!!! this please is always great!!"}
{"text":"A coworker recommended I try this place. He was right, good sandwiches at a reasonable price. I ordered the hot Pastrami with Deli Mustard and it was great. Not too many places you can hand the cashier a $5 bill and get change back for a sub. Meat had great flavor and the Sub Roll was soft and fresh. I highly recommend this joint."}
{"text":"Great place. Generous portions of  meat in the sandwiches and tasty. Without a doubt reminded me of the delis I went to in the bronx only more spacious! Will return. Great place off beaten path, wish it was in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Wow is all I have to say!  This is the epitome of a family built on a business model that seems like it no longer exists anymore.  First off if you like people in uniforms serving you, and trying to up sell you on getting the combo meal then you will hate this place!  The food was awesome.  I had the Pastrami sandwich with mayo, mustard cheese and pickles.  It only cost $5.50 and it was a large sandwich.  My coworkers got the steak and peppers and the other was the New York Sub, and they loved their sandwich.  I love the local joints in town.  Support the local businesses, it is so much better than going to a corporate business that could care less about the customer other than the dollar.  Thank you Franks!"}
{"text":"Do not let the outside fool you. This place has some of the best deli sandwiches around. It is a walk up to the counter deli. They have a variety of sandwiches on there menu.  I prefer there tuna. Simple and delicious. The vegetables are always fresh and these cuts are always on point with healthy servings."}
{"text":"Our first time here. Loved it! Excellent sandwiches,  along with friendly and efficient service. We had the Meatball Sub & The New Yorker. Wow! Loaded with deliciousness!   For desert I had the chocolate mousse & my son had the plain NY style cheesecake. Tasty.   The two brothers making our food and ringing us up we're very outgoing and engaging.   The stars are only for the food & service. As the business has been around for over thirty years, it now finds itself located in a neighborhood that is a bit run-down these days.   My family and I will definitely be back. We love to try and support friendly and delicious mom & pop businesses!"}
{"text":"I came into Frank's for the first time and was not disappointed. The service was outstanding and the food was excellent. I would highly recommend eating here for a great deli sandwich. Family owned business for over 35 years."}
{"text":"They get a 5 star review for 2 reasons:  1.  Their subs/sandwiches are awesome.  They are priced well.  2.  They appreciate your business.  I enjoy giving my money to people who run their own business and appreciate their customers.  Seems to MIA these days."}
{"text":"Top notch hole in the wall deli and mini market. Family owned staff is super nice and chatty and damn they make a delicious sandwich. It's our family's favorite place. We will eat here at least twice a week! We even will pick up subs to sneak into the nearby movie theater or go on picnic! The sandwiches are a good 2-3 inches thick with meat and the bread is phenomenal. Our family's favorite is the club and the pastrami (hot or cold). Do yourself a favor and go here. You'll love it."}
{"text":"We found this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try. Their sandwiches are huge and delicious. The staff is excellent. We were treated to their rice pudding which was a real treat. We'll be back."}
{"text":"This deli deserves its 100% 5 star review-WOW!! I am extremely selective so when we needed a place to eat after a tournament at GCU, I was skeptically hopeful that the 5-Star reviews were ligit...they are! Fantastic sandwiches & the woman behind the counter even treated us to fresh made rice pudding-best I've had.. & I come from a long line of great cooks! We will be back when in the area!"}
{"text":"What can I say about Frank's New York style deli. If you haven't eaten there then you need to. Everything is fabulous from the sandwiches to the salads it's all fresh every day."}
{"text":"Forget subway or jimmy johns! Give me Frank's!! Fast, great service, oh and delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Their sandwiches are well worth the money!  I had the roast beef and it was stacked!  They serve them on 10 inch rolls and there was more meat than Subway would give you on a double meat order.  It was a little dry, but nothing mustard can't fix.  I will try it hot next time. Good potato salad.  Don't be fooled by the outside, it looks like a convenience store."}
{"text":"What a small little gem in central Phoenix. Their sandwiches are not only super cheap but their super flavorful and very generous with their portions. For about 7 bucks you get a huge sandwich stuffed with Italian meats and cheese and fresh toppings. As far as quality of ingredients and flavor, this has to be one of the best deals as far as sandwiches go in the Valley. It's also a small grocery store too so they have chips and drinks along with some other food items. I haven't tried any of the sides but their sandwiches are what you should be coming here for. Glad I found this place."}
{"text":"Coming from NY, this place hit close to home.  This place is a family-owned business and the place has got some character.   They definitely reminded me of the delis in NY.   The subs are out of this world!!!   Why bother going to subway where they give you like three slices of meat and one slice of cheese when you can get the most amazing subs at Frank's Deli.  I love the italian sub and the meatball sub.  mmmhmmmm.  I could go for some right now.  The rice pudding is my favorite dessert, but they do havey have pretty good cheesecake too.  :)"}
{"text":"Coming to Frank's deli was the closest I've ever felt to being an authentic New Yorker. And I had a layover in JFK once, so you know this place is for real.   The Tony is as advertised, piled high with delicious meats and cheese. The bread it light and fresh. The sausage sandwich is decidedly a step below, a perfectly acceptable yet lesser sandwich.   Even the potato salad is worth grabbing, a great balance of tangy and salty, potatoes cooked to perfection.   And there is nothing like impulse buying a six pack while your sandwiches are being made."}
{"text":"It was 8:30 on a weeknight and even though I had some chicken defrosted and ready to cook at home, I knew I wouldn't be done with cooking and cleaning until 10:00 pm.  So I hopped on my trusty Yelp app to see what I could pick up on my way home that was not fried or greasy and this little gem popped up.  I turned off Camelback onto 23rd Ave and the dark road looked bleak, the surroundings were questionable so I wanted to turn around but I persevered to the next block and the deli appeared on the left.  When I drove up, it looked EXACTLY like a deli you would find on the street corners of the east coast, it was uncanny.  Anyway, even though they were about to close and cleaning up the kitchen, the nice woman behind the counter totally hooked me up with some delicious sandwiches.  They were packed with meat and the bread was delicious, both people working there were extremely friendly and happy for the business.  I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Everyone who knows me knows that I am a sandwich connoisseur. I love subs and trying new places. This is by far the best place in Phoenix for a sub. High quality, large portions and low prices. Don't be fooled by the exterior.... Plus, everyone knows those little hole in the wall places always have the best food. The woman who made the sub for me was also extremely nice and was so thankful after I told her how much I loved this place."}
{"text":"Frank's is great. i'm pretty sure on my first visit the owners served me and it was excellent. Been back multiple times since, trying all the different sandwiches (all made on their excellent bread) and always received excellent service. Think I got out of there yesterday with a pasta salad, sub, cherry coke, and a Rocky Road bar for under $10. Stellar prices.  I'd love to elaborate but there isn't much more to tell. When you're working around the house on a Saturday morning and lunch sneaks up ya, 100% of the time you should go take care of that hunger at Frank's."}
{"text":"Best in class without a doubt. I've been coming to Frank's for 10+ years and thought I had written a review before, but apparently not.  Location leaves something to be desired, but who cares? I'm not trying to move in.   Perfect prices, perfect portions, and excellent crew."}
{"text":"What a surprise! Don't judge by looks! Sandwiches amazing and the two guys that work there super nice! Highly recommend and will be back!"}
{"text":"I had to show love to my spot  - ya know that one place that you have stuck with - time after time, no matter what. Well this is mine, I  remember eating here as long as I can remember. A family owned business, a combination of Market and Deli. Really nothing special about the place - building reflects the years this place has been open. Through the years the bread has changed, as well as the meat - but the taste somehow remains the same to me."}
{"text":"This sub shop is loaded. Great service. Good food. Groceries if needed and even a seating area! We order at least once a week"}
{"text":"This place has amazing subs that are very affordable. This place is a great hole in the wall deli with great service and an amazing product. Today I got the meatball sub with no bell peppers and it was phenomenal. I can't wait to go back and try the rest of their amazing subs."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are incredible here! Great people behind the counter too!  I own a business nearby and my guys are always happy to get a sandwich from here."}
{"text":"Second time stopping in for a turkey sub, both times extremely friendly service and the sub was great, filling and price was right. These type places are so much better than any fast food joint out there, by far, and the real way to eat fresh."}
{"text":"Came here about a hundred years ago and went in yesterday while waiting for some tires down the street. This is my new fave sandwich shop. Good portions, good ingredients, friendly people and less than a mile from my front door. The mom & pop atmosphere makes the sandwiches better. Thank you guys for a great lunch!"}
{"text":"Wow!! So happy we tried this hidden gem! Service is awesome, family owned and operated, really phenomenal sandwiches and a great value! $7 for a 10\", and it's stuffed full of goodness. I got the medium rare roast beef, that they make in house!! Yum. Drinks are well priced, pasta salad was flavored nicely. Will be back FOR SURE, and will definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best sandwiches I've ever had!  Happened to be on that side of town and needed a place to grab a quick lunch and saw all the great reviews for Frank's Deli so I thought i'd give it a try. It more than lived up to the hype! I got the New York style sub for $7 and could only eat half of it. Flavors were on point, bread was just the right amount of chewy and it wasn't over-sauced.   I am a sandwich-guy, it's my go to meal whenever I'm eating out. If you love a good sub forget ANY of the chains like Subway, Jimmy Johns, Jersey Mikes, etc. Get your butt to Frank's and get way more for less!  Unfortunately this place is way out of the way for me, but I'll will have to find a way to make the trip and grab another sandwich soon."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Found this place by chance. Love the small hole in the wall type places. Fresh bread! Pastrami sandwich was awesome. I'm so full I need a nap lol. Partner had corned beef was good he couldn't finish his sandwich. Sides were good too. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted a sandwich so I turned to Yelp to find a deli near by.  I found Frank's and it had some great reviews, we were not disappointed! It's a family run shop and they were all so friendly. I had the NY sub and my husband had pastrami both subs were huge they do not skimp on meat, cheese or veggies.  Came with pickles and peppers. Finished our meal with a slice of cheesecake also delicious!  We will be back."}
{"text":"Great pastrami & an awesome Italian sub. The same owners for over 30 years & the son was working the counter. Cool little spot"}
{"text":"Great \"Mom and Pop\" sub shop fresh baked bread and literally stuffed with quality deli meat!! I had the \"Tony\" sandwich \"10 inch\" and it did not disappoint reasonably priced for what you get. I would definitely recommend and return!"}
{"text":"Where's the meat?? AT FRANK'S! I went here for the first time today because I just couldn't stomach another sub from subway. The store reminded me of a neighborhood shop on the east coast. I was greeted by the friendly people behind the counter. I ordered the New Yorker and it was ready within a few minutes and was reasonably priced. It tasted great and had a ton of meat! I am excited to go back and try another! Glad I found this place."}
{"text":"Quaint corner store market.  Opened 1972.  Best sandwiches around! The quanity of meat on each sandwich/sub is amazing.  Their sides delicious! This precious Greek family make you feel welcomed, well fed, and a part of their family culture.  Be sure to stop by and have a relaxing time there."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious, humongous deli sandwiches and the freshest of ingredients!  Family owned son and mother were wonderful - excellent service!"}
{"text":"Is this place kind of in a ghetto neighborhood? Did my wife  lock the car doors as soon as I exited? Are the owners super nice and the sandwiches as ridiculously delicious as they are inexpensive? Yes, yes and hell yes.   Look, this place is the epitome of \"don't judge by the cover\" -- Frank's wife Hannah made my family's sandwiches, happily splitting a custom turkey sandwich into two parts to satisfy my girls' individual tastes. Frank's son Gus helped me at the register, answering my questions and giving his own suggestions. The portions were generous (everyone b\"save myself took some meat off their sandwiches), the rolls were fresh and soft, and the whole package was tasty, satisfying that just-off-the-airplane hunger before we had a chance to devolve into screaming fits in the car.   I initially was searching for a brewery when leaving the airport on the way to Sedona (where we'd undoubtedly have spent 60-80 bucks), but am stoked to have found Frank's on Yelp and feed the whole family for $16.79. Thanks guys, keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful stop at Franks! A real true New York Deli. We loved our sandwiches, they were huge and very fresh! Delicious :) And, the owners were so personable and friendly! Can't wait to visit Franks again. Thank you for the great service!!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches,  friendly staff.   The sandwiches were load and the bread was fresh.  Best sandwich I have had in a long time"}
{"text":"This place is an awesome mom n pop sub spot, i was at the hospital up the street n found this. The subs are pretty awesome n tasty n good portion for cheap... I got the ny style 10\" for $5.49. I love it, kinda hidden in a neighborhood but its great. Support the small bizz!!! My new sub spot!"}
{"text":"This is the epitome of a gem, when it comes to food joints. It's in a rough part of town, but that shouldn't stop you from coming. My boss and I stopped here during our lunch break - he recommended the place, because he used to come here years ago.   As far as the sandwich is concerned, it's a legit five stars. They don't have a huge selection, but I'm a man with a beard, so I don't need one. LOL! As far as the service, I wish they had a sixth star, because these people love what they do and it shows. I'll definitely be back sooner than later."}
{"text":"Best subs in town! Family own business for over 35years! Great prices and the best part is the quality of the food is amazing! I'll definitely be going back to Frank's deli again."}
{"text":"This place is terrible!   Being a native NYer, I was excited to find a deli labeled \"real NY deli\". This is the equivalent to a super shitty, dirty Bronx bodega or road-side \"deli\" in some po-dunk upstate NY town. This is no \"NY deli\".  The meats were over processed crap, bathroom was among the dirtiest I've ever seen any where in the world. On the positive, the people seemed nice & it's cheap. Totally disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is in my neighborhood and I have driven by it almost every day for years. I just thought it was a liquor store and a shady one at that. However, I was on yelp looking for lunch close by and noticed all the great reviews of this place. I've been twice. Yesterday and today. Yesterday I had the \"the tony\" which is a fairly typical Italian style sub - it was awesome. The bread was soft and loaded with meat. Today I tried their Pastrami and it's hands down the best pastrami sandwich I've ever had. The Pastrami was served hot, but only the meat was heated and I have to say I really like it that way. I'm not a fan of my veggies being hot and wilted. I also ordered the potato salad - it was ok (sort of like what you get at the grocery store). The owners are very friendly and your made to feel welcome the moment you walk in the door. I am a new fan and will visit often. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The sandwiches here a really generously sized. The service has been quick every time I've come and it's not like no one is here. I eat a lot and have been tamed by the sandwiches numerous times.  It's a nice little Deli which is part convenience store. So you have some choices if you think the sandwich is not sufficient.  I am partial to the roast beef (raw). The deli has eliminated my need to go to subway for quick bite on a lunch break so for that - I am thankful.  PS: In addition to the generous serving of meat, the bread is actually good too."}
{"text":"Pretty awesome spot I just found out about.  Only complaint is that their \"Swiss cheese\" was actually white American.  But that won't stop me from returning"}
{"text":"They make a great hoagie. I recommend the Club Sub. Worth the drive from Tempe. They use good quality meat and it's a big sub for $7. The owners are always friendly as well. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"My wife is from upstate New Jersey and always raved about the deli's there and in new york; well in March we went to visit her family there and ever since, I've been trying my hardest to find a deli even remotely comparable to the stuff in Jersey. Frank's is it! The extremely affordable, very friendly, very helpful, and I could go on and on. It has a legitimate deli feel too. We will be the new regulars there and that's for sure! Definitely recommend to anyone who's looking for a good sandwich."}
{"text":"A really nice value for $4.50 (Corned Beef Sub) however this place is pretty sketchy- there was no soap or towels  in the bathroom and a stock guy had to accompany me outside to the bathroom to put the German shepherd outside the fence. He was pretty mean to the dog too."}
{"text":"Yelp how I love theeeee!!! I would have never known about this delicious little gem without you.   Frank's is located in a neighborhood and looks like a liquor store from the outside, it is a little sketchy from the outside but the food...... Oh the food. I got the italian sub and it was HUGE. The meat, cheese and bread were top quality. Combine that with 2 drinks and pasta salad for 10 bucks, yea I will be back. Again and again and again!!"}
{"text":"Like everyone else has said, don't let the outside fool you! Normally I try and avoid this neighborhood because it's not good but ... Great sandwiches , great prices and great staff. Serious sandwiches that fill you up all day. The staff is always polite and helpful . What else do you need ?"}
{"text":"Omg, so good! Really throwback style deli. Don't come for ambience,  it's more for takeout but wow, delicious.  I had a NY sub, my partner had pastrami. Huge portions, good quality. Family owned and very very nice."}
{"text":"Rare gem tucked away in a neighborhood north of Camelback!  My kind of place all the way.  Excellent price, family ran quality food."}
{"text":"Outstanding food! The pastrami, turkey and roast beef were tasty, great prices!! The service was top notch. Hannah and Gus were very attentive and friendly...They made me feel welcome! You must visit when you are in the area!"}
{"text":"Really good Deli tucked away on the backstreets. Not the kind of place you'll find by chance, but well worth the effort to make a special trip.  Great deli meats and they make sure the sandwiches are stuffed with it. KT had the Tony and raved about the quality and quantity of the ingredients. I went for the Steak, which was a bad choice. Not a terrible sandwich, just not what I was hoping for. More like a pot roast sub, as opposed to a Philly steak. Flavorful and edible, just not what was anticipated. Rolls were good quality; what a pleasure to not see an Italian sub on a French roll.  Sides of potato salad and macaroni salad were excellent! Some of the best I've found in Az. And the price of everything was beyond reasonable.   In all a very good place to grab a very good sub. Definitely worth straying from the beaten path."}
{"text":"Stoped here on a whim because we where in the area.  Nice little corner market for a minute it felt like 1979 again.   Fantastic value full of great meat and cheese. Bun was the perfect amount of crusty and softness. Nice dressing  fantastic flavor.  Great kosher pickle on the side.  My wife and I got two different Italian subs.  Quality meats.  I Will return.    Very nice personable service Hannah is very friendly and truly loves what she is doing.   HIGLHY RECOMMENDED."}
{"text":"Outstanding sandwich!  Don't be afraid to come in and have a great sandwich.  Prices are very low and the sandwich is packed with great ingredients.   Staff is friendly and make the place very inviting.  We will be back on our next trip up from Yuma."}
{"text":"Wow! My Boyfriend brought home the NY style Italian meat sub, and we snacked on it all night long. Coming from the East Coast, I am always on the prowl for a good Italian Deli, and Franks is the Cream if the Crop so to speak. Not only was the meat overflowing, but he vegetable toppings were crisp and flavorful, and the bread was indescribable...fresh baked, chewy, but soft and delicious. Mmmmmm, we are going to try all of the subs on the menu!!!"}
{"text":"Looks can be decieving. Although, the sandwiches are really good. I couldnt even finish mine and it was really well priced. The inside is like a general store and they sell lots of drinks. Workers are friendly. Overall pretty good place. Ill be going there after every time i play golf"}
{"text":"Very friendly and pricing is reasonable.  Met the owners son and very nice young man. Food was hearty with lots meet.  My wife and I are from Sacramento CA and don't know a lot of eating places near Grand Canyon University but I will recommend this place to lots of my son's friends and his Lacrosse teammates."}
{"text":"Seriously delicious.  I've been twice in the last two days, and can't wait to go again.  The NY and the Tony are amazing!  Their prices are incredible too-- you can't get decent sandwiches as these prices anywhere anymore.  The only downside is they don't have a/c, only a swamp cooler, so plan to do takeout or sweat on hot, humid days."}
{"text":"Stopped by after work and got the \"Tony\" sandwich, outstanding experience. The staff and food were amazing! The sandwich was overflowing with Italian cold cuts and the vinaigrette which I believe had basil in it complimented nicely."}
{"text":"Don't let the outside fool you!  Although it looks like a liquor store, once you step inside, you will be greeted by great people and an even greater sandwich. The first time I went, there were cops inside, so I knew it would be good, as they always know the greatest places to eat quick and cheap! I have been back since, and have been just as impressed. I highly suggest getting the potato salad as well, yum!"}
{"text":"This has just become my favorite deli. Flashbacks of 2005 on Flatbush ave and Ave L. The salami was perfection and the bread was so soft. I can't get enough. Can't wait to come back next week."}
{"text":"Wow...great lil deli in the hood.  Well made fresh deli sandwiches.  Huge portions.   Excellent pasta salad and great price.  Will definately come back ehen Im in the area.  Roast beef is super good! Italian sub excellent as well on fresh bread."}
{"text":"This place is a classic hole in the wall. The sandwiches are big, tasty, loaded with meat, and fairly priced.  The people who work there are very friendly.   Maybe you want to split a sandwich with a friend.  But I devoured all my deliciousness."}
{"text":"This is literally a corner store so don't expect a \"deli\", expect a sandwich counter in a gas station without gas pumps.   Everything about the family that owns this is absolutely correct. Super nice, inviting, and proud of their family store. 5 stars for service.  Sandwiches are 3 Stars. Average. Got the meatball wouldn't get it again. Meatballs tasted cheap, not enough cheese, bread not toasted. The Italian was pretty good, lettuce was a yellow and too much mayo but the meat was good.  The store is unkept. Signs and furniture piled up in corners. Shelves messily socked and need to be dusted. Absolutely no organization.   Also pretty disappointed that they had an old school ice cream freezer with stickers displaying circa 199 neighborhood ice cream truck teenage ninja turtle popsicles and strawberry shortcake bars.....but only cheapie chocolate bars inside....wha wha wha"}
{"text":"Frank's Deli has been in the same spot for decades. Growing up in the neighborhood I remember their subs. Yesterday I visited Frank's and I was in pure heaven when I was eating my New York style sub. The area has changed since I was a kid.  It's a little sketchy now but have no fear it's worth it!"}
{"text":"So many beverage selections.  Great subs.  Nice workers.  Just north of camelback.  Sort of off the beaten path but worth it!"}
{"text":"This place was great.  I went today and I want to go back tomorrow.  Great service and great food!  Thanks!!!"}
{"text":"Delish!!! Great family owned deli. We enjoyed chatting with the owners while they put together our sandwiches. Both our sandwiches were perfect. Plus who could beat having some rice pudding for dessert!! If we lived here we'd be regulars, but since we don't we'll just make sure we are here during each visit to AZ. Highly recommend Franks!"}
{"text":"Wow, what rock have I been hiding under? And right in my \"Hood.\" Thanks Yelp for the suggestion. I have passed it many times but never thought go go in. This place totally reminds me of the Deli/Convenient stores located near my Aunt's in Rockaway/Queens, right down to the \"Iffy\" neighborhood and the DVD's in the front case. It is a bit of a Divey, little place where you can get a sandwich, sit down at one of the 8 or so tables, get Takeaway, and/or pick up some staples while you are there. I was immediately transported back to NY the minute I stepped into the place.   I got the Roast Beef Hero, which was good. I also got a side of Potato Salad which was just average. That is okay though because no one knows how to do NY Potato Salad out here. ( Wait, I take that back. Hero Factory in Downtown Phoenix does) Ralph's negatives are: a very small menu, no chicken salad, no Wise products, and keeping in the NY theme, horrific parking.   I have to say the folks who work here are awesome, by the way. The owner is from Westchester county. ( upstate for us Long Islanders. Sorry a NY private joke which even the owner knew. lol--Love it) The young man working the counter was so very nice to me. I think I found a new place to lunch. No more hiding. That \"Proverbial\" Rock has been outed and overturned."}
{"text":"Amazing roast beef sandwich. The outside looks like a liquor store but don't be put off its worth a visit"}
