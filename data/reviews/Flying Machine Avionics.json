{"text":"I\"m really happy about this spot. I\"m kinda a coffee only person lately, so I can only review the awesomeness of their brewed coffee, the comfortable vibe of the spot, and the very friendly staff. The owners are top notch folks as well. Follow their social media spots for fun informative posts."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Avionics, and I was also a loyal fan from way before (since their Urbana location)! Not only is their coffee the best in town, it's also some of the best coffee I've ever had compared to the most hipster and fancy coffee shops in Chicago, Nashville, and Seattle! Their mocha is my go-to and it's always perfect, no matter who makes it (which speaks to the excellent training from Josh and the talent of the baristas). I've probably had over a hundred of their lattes, so it's a pretty big sample size! 

I've had their OTD bagel (so convenient and yummy), avocado stack (nutritious and delicious), and cheese sandwich (filling and flavorful). I'm definitely looking forward to trying even more from their food menu because there are always new yummy things to try! Honestly, there's just nothing they do wrong here- keep it up, flying machine team!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a properly poured coffee in a comfortable and quaint coffeehouse, then look no further than Avionics. If you haven't made it outside of campustown coffee shops, you are doing yourself a disservice. All the drinks are made to perfection and the decor is spot on. This wife and husband team are crushing the coffeehouse experience with a Page Roasting Company roasting their own beans on site."}
{"text":"Coffee: 5/5
People: 5/5

I give it only 4/5 overall because the chairs are kinda uncomfortable (cheap ikea type) and it's always cold."}
{"text":"Love this place. The atmosphere is perfect for a local coffee shop. Comfortable and warm. The egg sandwich was unreal. My latte was served at the perfect temperature so I could drink it immediately. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Big-city feel in decor, spaciousness, and menu. Small menu, but fresh, filling, healthy components. I did the harvest moon coffee and the Avocado stack. I couldn't get the sweetness of the saffron and maple syrup, but the coffe was well made. The stack components were spot-on: mustard-polenta-quinoa, soft cranberries, copious amounts of avocado, arugula, pickled-something, and a soft-boiled egg. He got the sweet heat latte (just like him, he insists I say) which he loved because of the light notes of pepper rounding off the robust flavor of the coffee. He also got the lox plate- as expected, but wish there was a little more lox to fill the four pieces of bread. Would definitely come back, books, headphones, and laptop in tow."}
{"text":"Tried this place during the bitter Arctic blast of winter. Really cozy with clean lines. Several free parking spots out front. 

I got a cappuccino to go and it was expertly made. I didn't realize they sell bags of coffee, too, so putting that in my cap for another day. 

Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is more or less the same review that I posted for the original Flying Machine with a few changes for the new location. 

EDIT: I initially wrote that Flying Machine is hands down the best place in town for coffee.  With all of the new coffee joints popping up that I haven't tried, I don't think I can comfortably say that any more, but I definitely will say that I still love their coffee and it is still 5/5 an awesome place!

Let me break it down for you.

Atmosphere (5/5)
This place has the whole modern look that is so popular these days, without any claims to pretentiousness.  Barebones decor that draws you in because of its simplicity.  There's a counter where you order, tables where you sit, and that's about all.  EDIT: Even in the new location, the aesthetic is largely unchanged and the minimalist style translates to the new location quite nicely.

Service (5/5)
All the staff there are friendly and all of them love coffee.  If you don't know what you're feeling like ordering on any particular day, feel free to ask for recommendations, because they will never steer you wrong.  They are always polite, always friendly, and always timely. 

Value (5/5)
Some people might debate me on this point because some people dislike having to pay 3-5 dollars for a cup of coffee.  Some people are crazy, because every dollar that I have ever spent here was completely worth it (and having filled up quite a few of those Flying Machine punch cards up, I have spent a pretty penny).  Value, being a subjective quality, may differ from person to person, but I am always more than satisfied with the money I spend here.

Food (and Coffee) (5/5)
You can get a regular cup o' joe for 2 dollars for a 12 oz. and 3 dollars for a 20 oz. Their normal brewed coffee like any brewed coffee, is not bad, but definitely not what you should be focusing on here.  The real gems come from the espresso drinks and the handcrafted coffees.  

The espresso drinks range from 2-5 dollars and all the ones I have tried were delicious.  However, espresso drinks are not my particular cup of tea, so I am not the best suited to comment. but from my personal preference at least, I have not had better here in town. 

My personal favorites are the handcrafted coffees. They serve both regular pour overs and Chemex pour overs for the same prices: 2.5 for 8 oz. 3 for 12 oz. and 4 for 20 oz. If you are unfamiliar with these processes, what they essentially do is specifically measure and grind fresh beans, and brew a cup of coffee fresh for you by hand.  It might take a little longer than your conventional coffee shop, but the wait is well worth it.  The handcrafted coffees here are the best brewed cup of coffee you can get in town.  The actual pouring process combined with the quality of the beans they use make for one hell of a cup of coffee. I have spent a good amount of time attempting to perfect a Chemex pour over myself, I have learned that it takes a good deal more skill than it appears.  I can safely say, every one of the employees here are extremely proficient.  

Now that they've moved, they no longer are housed with Pizza M, but to my understanding they have added their own menu of in house food items.  I have yet to try them, but they look delicious!

Overall:
Atmosphere: 5/5 - The decor may be personal preference, but hipsters love this place for a reason. 
Service: 5/5 - Can't beat the friendliness and proficiency of the staff here.
Value: 5/5 - For me, good coffee is always worth it.
Food: 10/10 - I can't comment on the food yet, but I'm not going to take away points until I do. If they do food as well as they do coffee, then I have no doubt it will be good! 
Overall: 25/25 - If you can't take the words of a stranger on the internet at face value, I understand. But try this place because everything about it speaks for itself."}
{"text":"I never thought it possible, but this is even better than the original location. Same amazing coffee augmented with locally roasted beans from the phenomenal Page Roasting, I find myself there nearly daily. The ambiance is wonderfully cozy, the staff friendly and helpful, and the food is the real hitter. Small, well-thought menu with delicious, unique, well-balanced dishes. My personal favorites are the fresh baked muffins, toasted Brie sandwich, and the egg sandwich. Eagerly awaiting their Sunday brunch offerings."}
{"text":"Delicious coffee, great service, chill decor, wonderful location. Try the \"Harvest Moon\". Buy coffee by the bag - Ethiopian is amazing. Happy to have a spot like this is midtown."}
{"text":"Really great pour overs and speciality drinks. We got the rosemary latte, which was perfectly subtle and delicious. I've heard excellent things about their food too, so I can't wait to try that out. I believe their menu is frequently changing at the moment, so I would recommend following their Instagram for regular updates on daily specials.

I only wish there were more seats and outlets! Avionics is definitely more of a hang out spot and not as solid of a place to study or work."}
{"text":"I am almost hesitant to write this glowing review to this awesome new coffee house. It is very hard to get a table here as it is. The coffee here is so flavorful and the atmosphere and decor is very soothing but hip. I tried one of their specialty lattes today. The sweet heat latte. It was *so* good! Spicy cayenne and just a hint of honey for sweetness - perfect. I have also had regular lattes and the Americano - all delicious. Their food menu looks good but I haven't tried anything yet. I hear the donuts are great.  I hope they either expand or open more locations. It is my favorite coffee in town."}
{"text":"Erin and Josh have done a killer job with this place! The atmosphere is comfortable, cozy but still clean and refined. My iced coffee was also super tasty and the food looked great. I will definitely be back to try out the menu and I could see myself being very comfortable working there on a pretty regular basis!"}
