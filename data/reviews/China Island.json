{"text":"I was in the area and wanted to stop into this Chinese restaurant. Having lived for a few years in Asia, I wanted to get my fix for this yummy style of cooking.

I ordered the shrimp and vegetable lunch special. It came with fried rice, vegetable soup, one spring roll, a crunchy Chinese finger food, and the shrimp & vegetables. The soup was good. It had a very light ginger taste to it that I enjoyed (don't really like ginger). The vegetable in the soup seemed to be Bok Choy and lettuce. As far as vegetarian Chinese soups go - this is standard fare. It would have been nice if the green parts of the Bok Choy was added into the soup to give it some more colour and texture.

The lady behind the counter was nice. A couple of customers prior to me ordered take out and ate in the restaurant. In a nice but slightly firm tone of voice she explained why it's good to let the staff know if they decide to eat in.

If I'm in the area again, I'll definitely stop by, and will be sure to specifically request no MSG because I think it's an ingredient in their dishes (tingly mouth/tongue post-meal)."}
{"text":"China Island has delicious and well-priced chinese food!  The menu is standard fare, but the quality and quantity is great! 

My favourite, their wonton soup, is 3$ and you get 5 to 8 wontons in the soup, when a lot of places give you 4 if you're lucky."}
{"text":"a great local option. The food is always fresh and quality. I recommend the shrimp with diced vegetables and almonds (or cashews). I love the combination and the veggies are great, not huge and bland."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!!!  I can't say enough good things about China Island.  If you like wonton soup, you have to try theirs.  The wontons are suffed generously with deliciously seasoned meat, and the soup is jam packed with big wontons, bbq pork slices, and napa.  It's the best wonton soup I've ever had! The owners are fantastic - very sweet people, and they can definitely cook!  I would recommend the wonton soup, bbq pork, and the chicken wings - you won't be disappointed.  I really recommend stopping in to try it out."}
{"text":"These folks are very friendly and they know their regulars / customers very well.  They have a good rapport with people.  I have tried the beef fried rice noodles and they were great.  I would highly recommend trying anything here.  I intend to try out more of the menu."}
{"text":"Food is excellent. I live in North York where or all the Chinese food is deep fried.
You can watch your food being made, you can order with or without MSG, with or without extra Chili's, or just plain. The food is clean and fresh, and it taste very good. I highly recommend the lemon chicken for those who are stuck on Canadian Chinese food, and if you really like your food well-made, tasting good, the special China Island, number 119 and chicken or whichever you like, shrimp etc. is quite delicious. The Lo mein is great, I order the vegetables on the side either number 10 or 13 depending on whether or not I want cashews, and I order steamed rice. It makes for a tasty low-calorie meal. If you are used to cheap Chinese buffet, don't come here the food is too good."}
{"text":"Outstanding Chinese Food for a local place. This is a traditional, no frills, neighbourhood place with a decent selection of food.  I love the chicken wings, eggplant/shrimp, shrimp w/lobster sauce and the wonton soup. Friendly efficient service.  They can get busy so be patient. They have a fully open kitchen, so you can watch them skillfully operate the wok burners and create some wonderful dishes."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Ordered a dinner for one \"B\"  just gor some white rice and lemon chicken and a stupid fortune cookie. No Vegies were included. Asked for the white rice to be exchanged for fried rice and just got rice with soya sauce. The chicken portion was large  for tw,  however, the lemon sauce was yellow but I could not taste any lemon. Found the place on yelp. I ate the chicken  reluctantly because i paid for it and threw out the rice. No repeat business from me!"}
{"text":"It's no foodie paradise, but this is a solid take-out Chinese place. It's the first take-out Chinese I've had in this neighbourhood, and I don't feel the need to go looking for another place.

The open, nothing-to-hide kitchen was a great feature. Watching the cooks prepare a wide variety of dishes in a tiny space while waiting for my order was a delight.

We ordered spring rolls (they have the thick, heavy kind), bbq pork (salty), chicken and broccoli (our favourite), honey garlic chicken balls (better than average; wish I'd chosen sweet and sour), and beef lo mein (also better than average).

While I was waiting, two regulars came in and we chatted a bit: they recommended the wonton soup, chicken wings, and pork and vegetables.

We'll be back next time we get a craving."}
{"text":"Ive gone here a few times.  The food is ok, but not really outstanding in any way.

I find the restaurant itself cramped and unwelcoming, and I find the service kind of snippy.  It always seems like I'm bothering them, making them work.  Went with a friend once, who asked for a little extra sauce on his dish, and he was curtly informed that it was impossible, because it was pre-packaged, and came in precise measures for each customer.  Draw your own conclusions.

Good if you're desperate I suppose.  Always closed on Mondays."}
{"text":"very good every time we order pick up
DELICIOUS hot and sour soup and the owners are soooo friendly
love it"}
{"text":"First time here. From St. Clair West Toronto. Was ready to give up hope of finding a close by Chinese take out restaurant. 
For freshly prepared take out, the best in recent memory and will be my new go to joint.
Ordered s&s chicken, s&s shrimps, spring rolls, black pepper beef, house fried rice and chicken chop suey.
Very little oil on the 3 fried items.
Spring rolls, best yet. Lite shell and fresh and tasty shredded veggies with a little black pepper.
Remaining items nicely prepared and seasoned.
$57, enough for 4-5 hungry people."}
{"text":"China Island looks like a Chinatown transplant but there are two important distinctions. 1) they have an open view we've-got-nothing-to-hide kitchen and 2) the restaurant is scrupulously clean. Wait, a third distinction; 3) plants in the window are alive and well.

Me and my 7 year old had the place to ourselves at 4:30 and I've never seen more than one or two tables of patrons in there. I think people are overlooking a solid and interesting contribution to the local restaurant scene. We didn't get too adventurous with our selections, but I can tell you the chicken with broccoli and the eggplant with chicken (maybe also black bean sauce?) were quite nice. Chinese food as prepared for people who don't want to take their Chinese food very seriously. Maybe if I return with an adult who isn't going to take two bites and then start asking to go home and watch cartoons, I can find out if they aspire to represent for west end Szechuan lovers.

Portions are generous, prices are reasonable, proprietors are pleasant and the clean and fresh surroundings will make you feel sheepish about the state of the walls and floors at your house.

I'll definitely return and/or get takeout."}
{"text":"I had such high hopes for a nearby Chinese restaurant. I know my Chinese, but I also accept the goodness of \"cheap chinese\". I ordered the General Tao (based on mentions here) and the Shanghai Noodles (w/ Shrimp & Pork).

The Shanghai noodles were unexciting. Tossed with some soy, nothing special at all. The General, on the other hand, was a disaster. GT can be very good and also very bad. This was without dispute the worst GT I've ever had. The \"chicken\" inside was like mush, like what you'd get in a sweet & sour ball. The coating was sponge-like soggy. The sauce was bright red. When I saw it on the rim of the take out container, I confirmed our order (GT bright red?) She confirmed. Oh, it had pineapple. Pineapple? The General would not be amused; coups have started over less.

Sadly, I would not return nor would I recommend it. The search continues."}
{"text":"I live close to this place so it only has to be mediocre for me to go there purely out of convenience. But it's not even mediocre. The service is not just bad, it's down right hostile. Again, I can over look bad service but the food is terrible too. My life would be way easier if this place was just passable but it is horrible across the board. Can someone buy this place and make it just passable so I can eat here once in a while when I'm feeling lazy."}
{"text":"IF YOU RESPECT YOURSELF DON'T EAT HERE 

Very low staff who speak down to patrons and insult little children. This happened after ordering food with my family and having the woman (stretch of the word) behind the counter go into a \"spit coming from the side of the mouth\"   rage after me asking how long it will take. When I get up and go to leave she becomes confrontational (while I'm holding a 3 year old) and rips up my order in my face. As I leave her own staff realizes she is in the wrong but she keeps her little mouth flapping and her minuscule brain churning with insults. She even complains to a patron \"I'm so tired people ask me how long it will take, today I want to close restaurant\" 

If I had given her one iota of attitude I wouldn't be writing this. But she unfortunately showed a low class approach to owning a restaurant and confirmed to me that her respect for patrons is non existent. 

I hope she chokes on an egg roll ;) 

IF YOU RESPECT YOURSELF DON'T EAT HERE"}
{"text":"Went to China Island after battling 10 hours of cravings. I chose this particular Chinese food restaurant because some of the Yelp reviews made it seem like I'd be in for a treat.  Twas a cold and slushy night so my eyes were glued to the ground.  Also glued to the ground was a HHHHUGE dead pigeon. Ew! It could easily have passed for a dark skinned pelican. Gross! The pigeon was in perfect tact, no visible signs of trauma, beak down in a pile of what I've convinced myself was strawberry jam.  I should have considered that a bad omen and just went home but I didn't.  Also, THAT corpse is exactly why I don't mess around with them Dundas West pigeons; they're cold blooded killers! 

So I ordered the general tao and beef fried rice. As I waited for my order, I went to the market next door and bought a bag of tangerines.  The guy was like, $4.99 and I was like that's crazy, these tangerines have the same liver spots as those pears I bought from No Frills. Ew! The General Tao sauce and chicken were good but the breaded batter ruined it; it was too thick!  I was horrified.  The bread/meat ratio was just out of control!! For every centimeter of meat, there were 161 centimeters of batter.  It was so upsetting because this could have been a great meal. The General tao gets all slimy and gross by the time you get it home. I'm conflicted because it didn't taste bad, but you shouldn't need a spoon and straw to eat General Tao chicken China Island!  I've been so psychologically destroyed after the general tao, I know I can't go back there.  I don't care if the rice is good, there are other places that sell decent rice without gooey General Tao. 

3 Stars cuz you ruined me for General Tao for at least a year."}
{"text":"On the advice of other Yelpers tried this out last nioght. Its not far from me, but definitely won't ever end up being my go to. Pretty standard offerings, but the execution is incredibly spotty. Ordered the NOT vegetarian Hot and Sour soup, got the Vegetarian version, even though ordering is done by numbers. Incredibly sour, very thin, unusal selection of veg and nada else. Left it unfinished. Sizzling shrimp had a good sauce and nice size of shrimp. The Kung Pao Chicken  must have been their version for vegetarians, ABSOLTELY no chicken involvement in this dish. Basically deep friend batter in red glop. Spring rolls were no surprise, overcooked and dripping grease.  Pretty slim attendance at the time we visited, can only imagine there is never a rush for this quality of food.."}
{"text":"When I was a child, I often ate at China Island. When I was a teenager, it was a bit of a tradition to have it at home on Halloween. After that I hadn't eaten food from China Island in years. I finally went back recently. The food is relatively cheap and delicious! You can also see the food being cooked right behind the cash register. I love the won ton soup at China Island. The first time I ate won ton soup was here. 

Eat at China Island!"}
{"text":"The very best won ton soup I've ever had, super delicious! Great owners, quick and to the point, fast service, no frills decor, decent prices. Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Worse chinese food I ever had (and i've been to really bad places). I oder the Sweet and sour pork but there wasn't any meat inside, only the breaded coat that it is used to fry things, the rice was bad and the egg roll awful.the only thing that I liked was the soup which was acceptable.

Service had nothing special."}
{"text":"BEST WON TON in Toronto..
Great chicken with cashews, everything I've ordered was tasty, thoroughly enjoyed!  Great owner, no BS and lots of personality."}
{"text":"Simple traditional Chinese food at good prices.  Would recommend the shrimp fried rice, but not the hot and sour soup."}
{"text":"I want to give this place 3.5 stars. It's more than A-OK, but at the end of the day it's your typical chinese restaurant with a super long menu of dishes which are all very similar to one another. The interior is a bit frumpy. I've only gone for take out. The restaurant has an open kitchen: you can watch them cook your food right behind the cash. The food is a bit hit or miss. I think it's clear there are some dishes that they are quite good at making, and some that are on the menu because you see them all over the city. I'd recommend the egg plant and beef dish as a delicious safe bet. There aren't any other options for good chinese food in the area, so if that's what you're craving this is probably the place to go."}
{"text":"Ignore the drab exterior and dated interior decor.  This place does Chinese food (just like the window says) and they do it very well !   Friendly atmosphere and good prices"}
{"text":"We have been customer since 2years ago. Everytime i didnt have time to cook, we went there to have dinner (free parking after 6pm) or order take out. The service is quick. Family owned business and the food is good. We usually order wonton soup and lemon chicken."}
{"text":"This is my go-to, no frills Chinese takeout place. The interior is drab and outdated but the service is fast and friendly. The portions are also huge, as I've over-ordered countless times. 

My fave dishes:
- Wonton Soup
- Ginger Shrimp in Hoison Sauce
- Beef or Shrimp Lo Mein
- Cantonese Fried Noodles
- Beef w/ Broccoli 
- Chicken Wings"}
{"text":"This is your classic, open-kitchen, plastic-tablecloth, mom-and-pop, Canadian-style Chinese restaurant, with one truly exceptional menu item: their wonton soup is a thing of beauty. They make a perfect broth from scratch and everything in the soup is balanced, with great texture and rich flavour. Oh, and this bears mentioning...it kills a hangover in 10 minutes flat. The other dishes are all good (you will not go wrong) but it is the soup that bears the crown."}
{"text":"Ordered:

Sweet & sour pork, $9.35
General Tao chicken, $10.25
Yang Chow Fried rice, $8.75
Pork Bbq fried rice, 7.85

Both fried rice were ok-tasting;  did not look fresh (dark & oily); mixed with \"old\" looking pieces of meat.  No egg.  Came with 3 pieces of \"doctored\" plump shrimps.

Both chicken/pork dishes were masterpieces of trickery!

Battered meat/reddish colour, that's all!
Both look the same.

The S&S pork's batter hid fat/dried up pork meat while the General Tao's batter hid small amount of chicken meat.

Walked-in for take-out around 7 pm.
They were busy with take-out orders.
Many ordered their wonton soup/s&s/general Tao.

They only take Visa credit cards.

Personally, I would not eat inside the restaurant.  The owners don't have pride in  running their restaurant; they have no cooking skills but pure trickery up their sleeves; just in for the quick cash.

After having ordered here, I would be \"killing\" myself if I ever order here again.
How can you trust a restaurant like this?

These owners give Canadianized-Chinese food a bad name!

Canadianized-Chinese food done with tons of tricks and no quality.

Edible garbage.  That's what I bought."}
{"text":"I am usually very iffy about Chinese food because more often than not I feel absolutely awful within a few hours of having it. China Island appears to be an exception! Went there last night and everything was delicious and served piping hot. Great service too. Had spring rolls, sweet and sour chicken balls, sautéed veggies and chicken fried rice. If you are looking for cheap, good Chinese, go here. Definitely will return. The open view kitchen definitely makes me feel confident no corners are being cut."}
{"text":"Whenever I find myself in the High Park area, I always drop-by for the BBQ pork wonton soup, especially on a cold day. It's simply the best of its kind in the city! For the price, you get a good-sized portion with plenty of wontons with slivers of bbq pork and hot broth. If you'll be eating anything else, get the small size; that's plenty enough. But if that's all you're having, go for the medium (the large is for two or more people). Though I haven't tried it, friends tell me that the chicken version is delicious as well.

For more traditional Cantonese food, go to Chinatown. However, if you're in the mood for old-school, Canadianized Chinese food, this is the place to be. Don't mind the 1950ish exterior and dated interior. It's clean and the food is what you're after anyway. 

I also recommend their sweet & sour chicken balls, lemon chicken, honey garlic ribs and spring rolls.

Though I'm an east-ender, I've been visiting this place every few months for more than 15 years. The owner, Jeannie, has always been kind to me. She works 6 days a week, so pay her a visit sometime."}
{"text":"If you like wonton soup, this place is the gold standard as far as I'm concerned. It's perfect - light but satisfying. They make the broth from scratch. Possibly the best hangover food in the west end! All the other stuff I've tried on the menu is right on the money (especially the chow mein). The restaurant has a funky old-school decor, the kitchen is open and in plain view, and the folks that run the place are really nice. Give it a try!!!"}
{"text":"Come and eat here. Seriously. Like most places they have their on and off times. But for a delish take-out or dine in canadiana chinese food. This place is the om of om-nom. I suggest the general tao chicken and thier chicken wings. For reasonable reason they, they are closed Mondays."}
{"text":"This place is just steps away and hence convenient for last minute dinner take outs. The wonton soup and the vermicelli noodles are my favourites. Always end up with leftovers cause the portions are huge."}
{"text":"this is not a fresh review so bear that in mind but it popped up being a neighbourhood joint and I remembered to review it. around 2013/14 I ordered takeout twice being a lover of chinese food but both dishes were totally bland and lacked meat and vegetables, they consisted mostly of carbs. prices were reasonable per se and waiting wasn't too long but for that quality, I never went back again although it's steps from where we rent. Better go to sushi place of the real thailand for asian takeout if you find yourself in this area! I hope quality has improved over time, sadly I won't be the one to experience it!"}
{"text":"Pretty darn good no-frills chinese food. Nick P recommended this place for a quick eat and run spot. I ordered crispy rolls, hot and sour soup, and shrimp/veggie lo mein. All very tasty -nothing overly greasy with the exception of the roll...but that is to be expected."}
