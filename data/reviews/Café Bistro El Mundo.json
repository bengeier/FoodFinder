{"text":"After a long day I decided a coffee and some grub should do the trick to get me into the study mood. I checked out Second Cup and was completely put off by their sandwiches. I found myself in El Mundo instead where I was pleasantly greeted. The girls on shift were nice and friendly, and the food was delish. The sandwhich was huge, plus 2 delicious salads, I now have lunch for tomorrow! The girls beside me were saying how yummy the cookies were as well. While I was working away I noticed the staff continually checking around for dirty dishes which is appreciative if you have a laptop plus books and whatever else on the table. 
It's nice that they have bigger booths as well as tables for all kinds of study groups or coffee dates. While I wish they had competitive hours to the 24hr second cup, being open until 11:30, having free wifi, outlets, and fantastic food is more than enough to make this my new spot. 
 I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"coffee was kinda disappointing.. the juice was great tho."}
{"text":"This cafe is partnered with Chai, a tea lounge right next to it! Chai doesn't serve good but you can order food from El Mundo and have it delivered to Chai. I love this opportunity! Otherwise than the pricey coffees and salads (which is all you can find in this area of town) I have zero complaints. The beet salad is perfect and fresh and the croissant \"Le Paris\" is to die for. The seating is comfortable and whoever complained about this place being dirty may be referring to the wrong cafe because it's always spotless!"}
{"text":"Excellent fresh juices, great sandwiches and salads. Slow, lazy service that forgets orders until you remind them. Not the spot to go when in a rush, but still great food and drinks. Coffee is above average but not incredible."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly, but the food was bad. Tables were dirty. I had the breakfast special, meal was cold, one piece of toast was burnt, one was raw, jam packages that came with the meal were open and half eaten. 

Skip it. Go somewhere else. Cocoa 70 is across the street, go there."}
{"text":"This small corner coffee shop is a favorite of McGill undergrads and grads seeking a refuge from campus or an internet connection. I frequented this spot when I lived in the ghetto. The food here is excellent. Try one of the many paninis, and dishes come with a delicious side salad. For all that the cost is surprisingly cheap.

Now on to the coffee. Leaves MUCH to be desired. I'm actually on the fence to give them 3/5 stars just because the coffee is terrible. It used to be better, but sometime about a year and a half ago they switched from freshly ground to terrible instant coffee stuff. That being said, the espresso is still freshly ground, so go for an americano, it's worth the slightly higher price.

The staff is friendly even when the rush hits. Service can be slow during the rush because there's usually just one or two people doing everything. This location is great for people watching, especially during the spring and summer when the big windows are open."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere to either chill or work. Their staff are generally very friendly. I like their sandwiches too even though they can be a bit dry sometimes. The breakfast service is not consistent with its standard. But the coffee is great. Good proportion for its price."}
{"text":"ok. ants galore.  One the corner with 3 different cafes, this one is probably the worst.  

It looks good from the outside, but once you go in you realize the floors are filthy."}
{"text":"Now called Cafe St. Barth-what a fantastic find. Super friendly staff, delicious options, reasonable price and a cozy place to start your day. A must visit!"}
{"text":"This has been one of my favourite coffee shops in MTL since I moved here. I've had the pleasure of coming here for a snack and enjoy a cozy place to read for years now. I've never had a problem with an order getting missed up. Furthermore, the baristas are kind enough to bring your order to you. 

It has been my experiance that while students come here most flood the other shops. Consequently, this is the quietest cafe at the intersection."}
{"text":"Drinks continue to be excellent and service courteous! 
This time ordered a latte. Yummy! Can't say what's better: the hot chocolate or the latte. Although it's a no-waiter cafe, they bring the drink right to your table (if it's a specialty drink and not something like filtered coffee). 

We picked a great spot to sit in. The breeze was coming in through the window and it felt so good on a hot day like today."}
{"text":"I was sitting in Cafe Bistro El Mundo doing some work and a crazy homeless person starting abusing and threatening a woman sitting nearby. I intervened and then he turned his abuse and threats to me. I called for the staff to call the police and no one did anything. I pleaded several times for them to call and they did not.

Finally a guy from the kitchen kicked the homeless guy out. I asked why they did not help me or call the police and they said they \"didn't know what to do\".

Unbelievably poor training. Can we not agree that creating an environment in which female customers feel safe and are not abused and physically threatened is a priority? Can we not agree that when a woman shouts \"call the police\" that someone should call the police? 

This awful experience made me feel extremely unvalued as a customer and as a human."}
{"text":"I often come here to study or work, and for sure it's the best place where you could focus, enjoy coffee and also enjoy the weather. During the summer they open their big windows, making it as if its outdoor so it becomes very relaxing and refreshing. The music isnt very loud, so it doesnt make you distracted at all, and they have tons of food options and variety in sandwiches, pastries, fruits etc. So could have a pretty healthy snack/lunch if you'd like."}
{"text":"El Mundo is a great study spot and is always packed with students (they go there like moths to a flame!) They have a wonderful list of drinks my recommendations are;
1) Hot Chocolate - if you're feeling adventurous get it with a raspberry shot
2) London Fog Latte 
3) Italian Soda

Their salads and sandwiches are great - your standard fare. 

warning: avoid the soups and the croissants they are disappointments."}
{"text":"Place is less than average. Croissant was overheated in the microwave which ended up being chewy and the service was slow considering I was the only customer in line and there were probably 3 other people seated at that place. For the price, definitely not worth it. You're better off going to Starbucks or Tim Hortons next block."}
{"text":"Café indépendant dans le Ghetto McGill, on y vient pour ses sandwichs et ses banquettes pour travailler. Wifi gratuit !"}
{"text":"The espresso was good, but still left a bit to be desired. Great cookies, decent salmon bagel (the cream cheese is only on one side), but nice sandwiches/wraps. It's convenient that they're open pretty late."}
{"text":"I got their food before, and the wraps were pretty good. If you order the combo it comes with a salad but the salads are  wayyyy too sour! Actually, I realized all their foods are pretty sour, even the soups! Please hold on the vinegar or lemon juice guys! On one occasion I also spotted a small fly in my salad and after that, just decided it wasn't worth it to come back. It can be a nice place to study sometimes but I prefer chai next door! Still, they have pretty good baguettes/wraps, just maybe not salads at times."}
{"text":"It's about $10 +tip for a combo which is: a small wrap, pieces of fruits, and a big latte. The big latte is 10oz but it's creamy and decent.

There is wifi, nobody is here in the summer, and yes! someone said the floors are dirty. This is true. Tables aren't that clean either. But the service is friendly!!

A mother sparrow and her teenage young visited here. Hopping around on the floor, on the sofa and on the table, the mother would find food, turn around and feed her young. And the young will gobble it up and shake his feathers. awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
That is the story I wanted to share lol"}
