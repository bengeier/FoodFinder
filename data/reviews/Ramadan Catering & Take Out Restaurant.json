{"text":"Got a takeout chicken dum biryani yesterday from their ready to go selection, around 4pm and by the time we got home around 7pm and opened it to eat, we could smell that it was not fresh. It was probably a day old, left out there to make money. We had to throw it all away."}
{"text":"On Thursday, I Got Chicken Biryani, Beef Biryani and the sales man repeatedly insisted that I should try their Kheer in sweet dish, which was not supposed to be on our menu. My family got food poisoning from eating Chicken Biryani and the Kheer when tasted, was bitter indicating that it was old and had gone bad too. The family had a very rough time for two days and could not go to work. This catering needs to be under close observation of health Inspectors and a word of caution for other customers. I will not try this place again."}
{"text":"This place has good food and its very tasty but the 5 star review goes for the service. The guy running the place is a very nice and reasonable guy. The prices are good.

I will visit again."}
