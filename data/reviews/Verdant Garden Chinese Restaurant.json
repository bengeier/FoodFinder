{"text":"We were a party of 5 and decided to give this place a try as was in the mood for family style Cantonese food.

Chose a 4 dish dinner menu for $29.99 that came with pork chop, beef with melon, free range chicken, and a small whole steamed tilapia fish.  The dishes are smaller, so we added a plate of snow peas (very fresh & green) and fried oysters.

Everything was tasty and we liked how it wasn't too salty.

Soup and red bean dessert was on the house.

There were other dinner combos available.

We left feeling satisfied, not overly stuffed.   A decent place to go for home style dishes."}
{"text":"Lousy service, mediocre food, forgot some orders and tried to cheap out on the included soup. 

Definitely skip."}
{"text":"Been here a few times when it first opened. It was really packed and you had to wait for a table at peak times. They open for supper but it's never busy then. Came here tonight at 11.30pm and there was only 2 other tables in. Food is ok here and not that expensive. Tonight we got the tilapia special. It's only $16.99 for tilapia 2 ways. You can get the fillets in soup vermicelli or with flat rice noodles or in congee. Then the bones and head are coated and deep fried. Then they're tossed in Maggi flavouring. We also got an extra dish of green beans. The food was pretty good. But we couldn't finish everything between the 3 of us and had to pack up the fish bones. 
Food is usually not so good, when the place is packed. Hence, why we hadn't been back in a while. The last few times, the dishes weren't so good and portions were shrinking. Also, the service was crap, with wrong or missing orders and not getting the daily soup. 
The Coors light are $3.50 each and if you buy 2, you get 1 free. So it's only $7 for 3 bottles. 
After tonight, we might start coming back again. Nice place for traditional cantonese dishes."}
{"text":"Overall, 3.5 stars.

I really like this neighourhood restaurant.  It has a homey, small business atmosphere.  The food this evening was delicious enough.  The Eggplant and Sea Cucumbers Hot Pot ($15.99) tasted salty and spicy, totally not shy from what it was meant to be, though it could be too salty to people who didn't love sodium as much as I do.  The vegetable dish (sorry I don't know how to translate the name into English) was sweet and fresh.  It was recommended by the manager to contrast the bold flavour of the hot pot.  It was an excellent recommendation.  The services from other wait staffs were sufficient.  The pricing was good.  The decor was contemporary traditional.

The only reason I am withholding a higher rating is because I have yet to try some fancier dishes.  I need that to find out the versatility of the chefs.  This means I enjoy Verdant enough that I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Verdant Garden Chinese Restaurant is a new Cantonese style restaurant that opens recently in this ultra competitive Scarborough/Markham area.

Only the best will and can survive. Here taste, portion, varieties and prices, all determining factors.

I can hear the sound of open flame and wokking during all these time from the kitchen. This place smell and sounded promising! Prices here is really reasonable. Most entrees and dishes are between $6.50~ $8. No lunch special really needed as a noodle or rice dish at  $6.50 or so includes soup of the day?!  

???? ($6.25) Fried Rice Noodle with Beef was well executed.  Nice fresh from the Wok aroma and the portion was really generous. Usually I complain about food in Chinese restaurant being salty but my noodle would need a touch of more seasoning.

The Soup of the day was really good, has this really balanced clean taste, something I feel that drinking that would have some health benefit.

I will be back to try out their dinner offering soon! Especially they are having 10% Grand Opening Special!"}
{"text":"looks like a family own restaurant.  the dad acts as a manager... actually doesn't look that bad inside.  food is okay .. very average... i did not find that anything was spectacular.
