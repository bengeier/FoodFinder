{"text":"This is/was my regular take-out place and used to be very dependable. However, we got food the other night and my lomein noodles were awful, they weren't the right color and tasted like pure MSG and had virtually no veggies at all. The egg rolls were so pathetic, if it wasn't so cold out I would have driven back there and gotten my money back. The egg rolls (which I usually really like, even better than Pong Pong) were about half the size as normal and looked and tasted like they were microwaved and from Costco. Two stars because the other people's orders (General Tso's and Mongolian Beef looked ok). I will give this place another shot because I'm hoping it was an off night."}
{"text":"I would give zero star if I could have. 8 of us from the office ordered some food today, we called at 11 to have it delivered at 11:30. The guy was an hour late and only brought 7 orders. Worst place ever."}
{"text":"This review is for the Carry out lunch special.  
I tried their veggie lunch special and what i liked about it are:
1)  Only 5 $ 
2)  food was ready in less than 10 min 
3) Taste though was not the best but was reasonably good for the price you pay.

I will definitely be trying  their other options"}
{"text":"Very poor quality - food tasted reheated and old.  When they first opened it was TOP Notch considering no one spoke English :-( but they were generous & thankful for our patronage.   Once they obtained there liquor license all went down  hill.  It's appears to be reheated & reheated over and over again - and maybe even recycled dishes from leftovers.   Idk - but nothing tastes fresh anymore"}
{"text":"We have gone twice to this restaurant but will not be going back.  While I am accustomed to eating mediocre Chinese food in this town, the main entrees were quite poor. 

I am not sure how you screw up chicken fried rice but they did- the rice did not taste fried and the chicken was barely cooked.   The first time we had it, we figured they just made a mistake.  But when we ordered it again on the second visit, we realized they just don't know how to cook

If this place survives for another 6 months, I will be shocked."}
{"text":"Stopped by to pick up some soup and a dish for a late dinner. 

large hot and sour 
large won ton 
large chicken lo mein 

All was really good, the soups were not over salty (MSG) as with most restaurants and the lo mein was devoured. 

The also have a sushi bar in with great prices. There is a sign out front as they are trying to obtain a liquor license. So beer, sushi and Chinese food, what a great combination. I can't wait to go back and try more dishes."}
{"text":"I was really surprised at this place. Got a little scared when I found it empty but was pleasantly surprised. I can't speak for the sushi. Personally I never eat sushi during the warm months especially in AZ. But my daughter had the orange chicken which I usually hate because it's usually mushy from most places. This was crispy and great. I had the Mongolian chicken that was a bit spicy but not too spicy. I can't believe Pei Wei get's so much business cause it stinks. We will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"I love the food there!  It is under new ownership and the food is great taste and quality, We have eaten there often and will go back!"}
{"text":"I have not eaten here for about a month due to a nasty case of food poisoning I am sure was from this restaurant. For sushi, we will stick with Mikado which is right across the street."}
{"text":"It's your basic chinese place. We go here for lunch every now and then and I've tried numerous lunch. I didn't like the orange chicken but the Kung Pao is really good. What's really nice is the price and quantity. You'll get soup, wantan chips, an eggroll and your meal for $7. That keeps us coming back"}
{"text":"This place was a one and done for us.  After reading the other reviews, I was willing to give it a shot.  Sorry I did.  The sushi (yes, 50% off) was so-so.  Far too much rice and barely any ingredients inside.  We got the Tootsie Roll, Rainbow Roll and Sweet & Sour Triple.  The sushi on the rainbow roll was barely cold and the flavor was blah.  The sweet & sour triple (shrimp, pork, chicken) was also very blah.  

Not that this had anything to do with the food (but maybe) but it was so hot inside the restaurant we thought the A/C wasn't working.  Even the employees (all 4 of them) were fanning themselves.  We could hear the air kick on so either it was set very high to save $$ or it wasn't working properly.  I like my sushi cold and this was not.  

Also, the 2 servers kept coming by asking us the same questions and then not really understanding our answers.  So when they asked us if we wanted more water and we said no, they asked us again.  Still, our answer is no.  It was like they didn't get it.  

The better choice for sushi in this area is definitely Mikado which is amazing.  Too bad this one didn't cut it."}
{"text":"Visited for dinner on a monday with my fam... Saw the 50 percent off sushi sign at the entrance. What... They have sushi? 

The place wasn't busy at all. There was a couple eating and another guy ordering take out. We were promptly seated and brought drinks. 

I decided on sushi, my hopes not very high. I ordered the chandler roll and the rainbow roll. My sister ordered mu shu pork, my mom ordered lo mein. We also ordered spare ribs to split.

After a round of water and complimentary fried noodle chips, we were served or appetizer. The spare ribs came out nice and hot... The flavor was delicious! A perfect combo of sweet and savory.

Next, my sushi order... The chandler roll was great. I usually don't do rolls, but I'm glad I did. The roll was beautiful and the taste matched. And for six dollars, I can't complain.

The rest of the food was great, we were all stuffed. The service was also amazing. I know its tough in that shopping center so I hope they stick around! 

Definitely will visit this place when I'm back in town."}
{"text":"I haven't physically eatten at the resturant but we got a flyer at our door and we decided to try it. We had company over and I went rather crazy trying out new foods and of course, I took advantage of the sushi. No place in Arizona delieveries sushi. 

All in all the whole house was impressed. The sushi was great and the orange chicken was wonderful too. Not too spicy at all but you can taste the orange in there. We are defantely ordering from them again."}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a shot as I am a huge sushi fan and they advertised their sushi as half off. Most places do this at certain times and on specific days. Also, most places limit the half off label to \"regular rolls.\" Currently, it appears as though this is an all day thing and applies to all of their sushi. 

We went around 7:15pm and the place was not very packed. My fiance loved her meal (chicken and vegetables). The one downfall to my experience was the amount of time I had to wait for my food. My fiance's dish was brought out right away, but my sushi (rainbow roll, octopus, tiger roll) did not come out until she was half finished with hers. 

The sushi and price were alright with me though so I'll be giving them a second chance."}
{"text":"Yuck
In a word \"Yuck\" . All items taste like they were cooked in old oil. Never again. We will be going back to Asian Grill."}
{"text":"This place is not good. I don't know what planet they come from, but it was not any shrimp tempura I have ever seen or eaten. The fried rice is cold, mushy and bland, and the General Tso's chicken is barely passable. Not coming back."}
{"text":"Just ate dinner here with family.  We got House Fried Rice, Kung Pao chicken, Beef with string beans, Sweet and sour pork, and Chicken Chow Mein, all of them were delicious!  Service was great too!  We'll definitely be regulars. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out for lunch one day, since we work down the road. Great lunch specials large portions and decent price. Food was all good standard american chinese. Plus a light sushi bar. Service was quick and polite."}
{"text":"This place used to be decent, where you could get the staples  in 10 min or less.  But they have recently gone under new management and the food and service is terrible.  I experienced the \"new management\" the other night.  We ordered 2 dishes and it took 30 min for our food, which was carryout!  They have really cut corners and the food, which used to be above average was horrible.  The chicken and broccoli was bland and watered down, the house lo mein noodles were dry and tough with scant portions of meat, the crab puffs were filled with runny cream cheese with barely any crab flavor.  Our consolation prize for waiting 30 min for carryout was 2 mushy springrolls that were inedible.  New management better get it together and hire a new cook.  Poor service and poor food = No Business!"}
{"text":"Wish I could say I love this place. Wish I could say I like this place a lot but atlas, it cannot be said. We've tried to phone in our orders and to our surprise the phone rings endlessly. Then after the 45th ring, it hangs up. We attempted this 3 different times since it's opening. My husband decided to give it a chance in person. The food was mediocre. Greasy and bland. We ordered off the \"diet\" menu as all the vegetarian meals fall into that category. It's cheap so I guess I can't complain too much. The place is never packed. I don't know how well it will do."}
{"text":"Love their lunch specials! Only $5, good service, food is always ready in 10 minutes, and you'll definitely be full with your lunch order. 

I believe this place is under new owner, thus the previous reviews doesn't really do this place justice. Food is pretty decent for the price you are paying and the place is very clean. I've become a regular for this place, go there at least once a week now. I love their chicken lomein, twice cook pork, chicken curry, and beef with broccoli. 

This is a place where I would take my friends and family for a good meal."}
{"text":"Decided to give it a shot.  Food was delivered cold, chicken was old and hard, low mein was burnt.   Called back to get a refund.   Food was not edible!  Definitely won't be a repeat customer.  Sticking with Beijing up the street in the frys parking lot.  WAY better food!"}
