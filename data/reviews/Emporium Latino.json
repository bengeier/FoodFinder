{"text":"It's been awhile since we've been to Kensington and decided to check it out during March Break. My husband had been craving for authentic Mexican food and we decided to check out Emporium Latino. 
When you first walk in, you will notice so many things to buy. Fresh vegetables, cacti, etc. You place the order to the cashier and then once you've paid, you give it to the lady at the back. 
It was a long wait to get our food..about 20 minutes. But, it was good to browse around the store and look at all the items you can buy. 
We bought vegetarian burritos and some fried churros. Amazing food. 
We will come back again for sure!"}
{"text":"The pupusa and the tamale are fantastic, they are made in the back of a grocery store, made fresh to order."}
{"text":"Ahhhh, if I lived in Toronto, I'd be here way too often. I ordered the chicken papusa and chicken tamale. Everything was made to order and had tons of flavor. Their prices are cheap, and the portions are decently-sized. 

Don't come here for the friendly staff, though. In all fairness, my friends and I did walk in at around 6:20 and the kitchen closed at 6:30 (we never do this...we didn't see the hours posted on the door) but after we were told we had to take our food to go, we double checked to make sure it was okay that we placed our order and said that we'd leave if they wanted to close up. The lady said it was okay, but continued to give us a nasty attitude the whole time. The food made up for it, though. I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for delicious, cheap eats."}
{"text":"Best pupusas without a doubt - try them all!!! We've tried the revuelta, de queso, loroco and frijoles. Reasonably priced and good size as well. My family and I have been here multiple times and each time their pupusas and tamales are made fresh to order and are delicious. The owners and ladies cooking are so incredibly kind too. A hidden gem I'm glad to have found!"}
{"text":"Super good Papusa's. I have lived in Guatemala and we get them there and it's pretty Damn close to the roadside Papusa's you can get while driving to El Salvador. Amazing."}
{"text":"This was the first place I ate when I moved to Toronto. I had a beans-and-cheese pupusa, and it it was so good - made fresh right on the spot. There are all kinds of good things on the menu - tamales, even! Definitely what I'll have next time. 

The hot sauce was very hot. And the prices were very low. Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't already been said? Delicious pupusas - and if you don't know what that is, you won't regret discovering these savoury pancakes - made fresh to order. A tasty and wholesome meal for under $10.

For what it's worth to those with diet considerations, I took my nut-allergic, lactose intolerant friend here and there were no issues with the bean pupusas topped with their salsa, cabbage and dressing."}
{"text":"Emporium Latino is a Latin American grocery store with a small kitchen area at the back where you can order hot food. 

The grocery store has all the import staples that you wont find at major grocery stores. They are well stocked with beans, peppers, corn flours, sauces, drinks etc. and the price's are pretty reasonable as well.

The kitchen area serves pupusas, tacos, empanadas, tamales and a few other similar quick eats. You order at the cash register and take your paper slip back to the people working in the open kitchen and hang around the back half of the store until they call out your number (its on your stub part of the slip, dont lose it!). The seating area is at the front of the store and seats maybe 6 people. Seats are at a premium.

I've eaten everything on the menu and its all quite good, but the standout item are the pupusas. My wife was raised in So-Cal and she laments how our Latin American food isnt on par with what she's used to. The pupusas at Emporium Latino are the only food that tastes as good as she had back in Cali. The dough is made perfectly and generously stuffed with your chosen filling. Oh did I mention theyre pretty inexpensive as well ($3 a piece).

My only complaint is the store is kind of dumpy and is in bad repair. The open kitchen area appears to be clean but those germaphobes wont be able to handle this one. Go for the pupusas and close your eyes."}
{"text":"Food literally made while you wait so super fresh and really cheap and very authentic . The day we stopped here to eat they were cooking outside the shop on the pavement and the three women were running a very slick kitchen and it was good to watch the food being made before your very eyes. We had the pork and cheese pupusa ,salad,spicy sauce and empanadas and I've got to be honest the food was disappointing it lacked flavour and was very bland!"}
{"text":"Whenever I am in Kensinton Market and want to eat something, I come here to eat Pupusa. It was a small place, but there was  tables and seats enough size to eat. Pupusa was very tasty and the price is good. I keep coming back here."}
{"text":"The best pupusas I've ever eaten! I got the pork pupusa and the bean and cheese. Cheap, filling, and delicious. If you're strolling through Kensington I definitely recommend stopping in."}
{"text":"Had the chance to visit this hidden gem one morning. I wasn't hungry at the time but as soon as I saw pupusas on the menu I couldn't pass up the opportunity. Having spent a lot of time in El Salvador .... loving the people and culture I naturally became fond of pupusas.

The taste was pretty authentic ... and given this was a grocery store in front and food counter in the back ... I enjoyed the \"no fills\" atmosphere similar to the pupusarias in ES. They had a seated covered area opened to the side walked; in which I sat and enjoyed a beans, meat and cheese pupusa (known as revueltas) and a cafe con leche. They also asked if I wanted it spicier ... which is always a plus for me. The hot sauce looked homemade and not just \"Cholula's\" or tabasco .... it was good. 

The lady at the front and the girls at the back were friendly. A nice experience overall ... it is what it is. I only wished the prices were the same as in El Salvador but I guess I saved on the airfare as well ... lol. Will definitely be back to try other menu items. Kensington market has a lot of unique places to be discovered."}
{"text":"The real deal!! Had several types of Pupusas and tacos. Everything was delicious, fresh and very inexpensive. This is a grocery store with 3 small tables to sit. Not elegant, but the food is authentic and the staff is super friendly. Will be back for more."}
{"text":"I don't give 5 stars out that frequently, so when I give a 5, you really should read my review. 

I would've easily missed this place had it not been for the yelp reviews- not that it was hidden, but it looked like someone's garage/a home. It wasn't until I walked inside did I realize this was such a popular place.

It's quite confusing at first when you step inside because it's a bunch of tables with no staff really at the entrance. You have to go to the second floor to place your order at the cashier, and then go to the back/kitchen area to give the ladies there your order slip.

The pupusas were WONDERFUL, and at a fair price. The pupusas are all handmade and you can decide on what type of pupusa you want. I tried the chicken and cheese (because I wanted to be healthy) and the Revuelta (refried beans, cheese, meat). Honestly, if I decided to come eat pupusas, why should I have even tried to be healthy. The Revuelta stood out and left my taste buds wanting more.

For the price and quality, I'm definitely coming back here. I just hope this hidden gem doesn't get too popular because there isn't that much space and the kitchen is not the industrialized type- maybe more of a stove you see in a food truck."}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking for a nice little place that bring memories from our country. And we found it!!! The gorditas were awesome and the people very nice. We will come back to enjoy a little place with big flavor and character."}
{"text":"If you come here, which you should, order pupusas all the way! Delicious. Reasonably priced. No frills. I always get the revuelta (combo of beans, meat, cheese), chicharron, and cheese and loroco (a kind of edible flower). They're made to order so they come out fresh and hot. I order mine spicy. Sauce good, too. The curtido (cabbage salad) is flavourful and still crunchy!"}
{"text":"Tasty pupusas! Some of the best I've had in Toronto. They are $3 each which can run you up quite a bill if you're a big eater and they're not that big but they are filling. They also give you a decent serving of curtido and salsa. The salsa and curtido are very good which most people focus on just the pupusas but if those two things aren't good then it can ruin the pupusas. But overall great little place, very cold during the winter so bundle up!"}
{"text":"Had the pork tacos and plantain for lunch.
If you are not prepared for it, the pork part is really fried pork fat. This is fairly common in Latin America, but if you are expecting pork meat, it may not be suitable for all palates. If you pull out the pork rind, there isn't much left.
The plantain, although a generous portion, was not uniformly cooked, resulting in soft parts at one end and unripe parts at the other.
Staff was friendly, and it's a nice setting to sit and people watch on Augusta Avenue."}
{"text":"I keep coming back to here for around 5 years and I haven't been disappointed yet. The tacos are massive, the Pablanos great and the deep fried plantain with cheese an amazing sweeet mess!  Go here now!

Recommended"}
{"text":"I've been picking up tortillas here for a couple years now, but this is the first time I got to try the food.  The storefront is very unassuming and all you see when you first enter is a few picnic benches and groceries.  If you go up the stairs, you'll see the cash register area, and that's where you place your food order. 

Since it was my first time here, I requested recommendations from the girl working here. She was very helpful and explained the different food they have, mostly el salvadorean, and made recommendations of what to try.  We ended up trying the corn tamales and three different types of Pupusas - Revualta which is beans, cheese & pork, Sausage & cheese, and chicken & cheese. It's served with a side of coleslaw topped with either mild or spicy sauce. 

What can I say about the food? It's made from scratch, it's fresh & flavourful, and it's made with love. I loved the combination of the slaw, spicy sauce and pupusa together. I barely remember thinking I should take a picture of the food, except there was none left on my plate.  It's also very affordable with the pupupas coming in at less than $3 each, and the tamales just a little over $3. 

I'm definitely planning to return again."}
{"text":"I love the tacos, pupasas, and tamales here. Finally got around to trying Seven Lives, and I have to admit, I would rather come here for a straight up authentic taco without all the bells and whistles. And I get to do a little grocery shopping at the same time."}
{"text":"Yes! This is an amazing little store stacked with all the Latin American foods that you can want! Did I mention they do take-out? Papusas, tamales, tacos, fried yucas, and a whole lot more Latin American favorites can be made fresh on the spot. You can choose to wash it all down with some of Mexico's finest sodas.

You order upstairs at the cash counter, grab a number, and then pick up your food at the back once your number is called. Seating is limited to 3 picnic tables, so be sure to prepare to eat while you stand if needed! Friendly service!"}
{"text":"A great general market, awesome eatery and a King's coffers worth of all that is Salvadorean and Latin American cooking ingredients.

They sell some great pupusas which in case you may not know, it is one of the most known and arguably best Salvadorean dishes. Delicious to the senses however, make SURE you always eat it with curtido (pickled cabbage, sometimes carrots) which is a necessity as it adds a refreshing taste to the experience as the pupusas by themselves can taste a bit dry if you eat too many without it. Also, they sell you the ingredients to make them at home which, I do, and are always a hit at my parties.   

Aside that, remember this place is also a market, selling most of what you would need for dinner or to make specific Latin dishes, not to mention general groceries.  

I highly recommend checking this place out if you are in Kensington, want an inexpensive snack and you are on the go!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience at Emporium Latino today. It's an interesting experience, different from your typical restaurant experience. The food is very tasty, filling and authentic, I learned more about Latin American culture there.
The staff were all very friendly and nice. 
The food is also inexpensive for Toronto. 
Can't wait to grab a bite at Emporium's tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Great made to order pupusas. No frills for sure.  Not the friendliest servers but so good!!!  Not as busy as El Gordo so come here instead for fresh and delicious pupusas.  I can eat 100 of these so it is a good thing I do not live close by."}
{"text":"Yes! Yes! Aaaand Yes!

It's a little confusing. This is a market, not a restaurant. They have a couple of picnic tables in the front part of the store, but they might well be full, so be prepared to take away. It makes eating your incredibly delicious food you just purchased quite difficult. It is worth it, however. You have to order at the cash register and deliver your own ticket to the kitchen in the back. But if you can forgive all that, you're in for a treat of tasty and authentic pupusas and such. Yummy yummy yummy."}
{"text":"Long withdrawal from tamales de pollo(chicken), and finally! FINALLY I have found some in the city.  Noms to the max.  Amongst other things of course.  Just wish I had more time to check stuff out."}
{"text":"tiny, unassuming grocery store in Kensington Market, but their handwritten type on the blue garage door caught my eyes. The inside has some uninviting yellow fluorescent lighting with a food counter all the way in the back. Its a small space doesnt feel the cleanest but has a lot of character. Seating in the front thats first come first serve with communal tables. In the summer its lovely having the windows open with the breeze coming in, great for people watching!

The pupusas are great! Warm, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside dough with tangy slaw on the top and spicy salsa like sauce on top. Also got a tamale wasn't the best but was very filling, so it wasnt an expensive meal."}
{"text":"as if scooped up from the bustling streets of cuba or mexico or something spanish this little hut of a storefront is parked amongst a couple of empanada restaurants and its filled with traditional latin products.

on the outside there are tubs of different spices or vegetables, some unrecognizable to the eyes of a white boy like myself.  so i popped in and continued feeling mildly goofy for taking photos of jalapeno peppers and such until the shy woman at the front asked me if i was looking for something.  i wasnt, except pleasure, and not that kind of pleasure, latin pleasure, and not that kind of latin pleasure.  

there were tubs of interesting things in their fridge.  there was a tub of something that looked like it might have been cream cheese but then i thought it looked more like duck fat.  who knows.  beside that, looking much more palatable was a tub of something that looked like prepared tuna.  latin styles.

i got none of what i was looking at but decided to be delicate about my first latin lover purchase and bought some chipotle powder for a mere buck sixty five.  

next time i might buy that duck fat, but more likely the tuna, and perhaps if i can find a use for it, a piece of cactus.  

or a pinata!"}
{"text":"Great spot to pick up a quick bite... pupusas and empanadas.
They have many tough to find items from South America.  They even have different flavours of Tang that you wouldn't find anywhere.  Impressive."}
{"text":"I've been going to this little gem for years and have neglected to give it its due.

It's a fine Salvadorean goods establishment. And by fine, I mean, you find Salvadorean goods - don't come in expecting high and/or ultra modern decor.  

It helps tremendously it is owned by Salvadoreans b/c I can source my Salvadorean goods & needs with the ease of a local. Besides the homemade typical food they make, they also carry Goya products, although not a fan, when you are cooking a Latin American meal, they can come in handy. Although not associated with them, I feel such pride whenever I see a line-up of customers - they serve good food with a friendly attitude and seeing them do business is well deserved.

If you want to try Salvadorean food: pupusas, tamales, tortillas, semita & quesadilla (& even the paletas are a great treat!), and these are the ones I've noticed, this is your place!

The owner, Doña Cecilia, is one friendly and reliable grocer and if you order your comida tipica ahead of time, you bypass the line-up!"}
{"text":"Didn't actually get to eat here, just posting a note to vegetarians: everything is made with lard! Sad :("}
{"text":"My go-to place for Mexican and Peruvian ingredients. I always get a dozen of their homemade tamales and salsa. The employees are friendly - they don't laugh when they hear my fractured Spanish lol."}
{"text":"Emporium Latino serves some of the best pupusas in downtown Toronto. You know a place is good when it's a hole in the wall...and you're served by middle-aged mamas who look like they know their shit and can whip your butt with one hand. 

The pupusas are so fresh. They make them to order, so it does take a little while to get your food. The pickled cabbage that comes with the pupusas is so crunchy, tangy and full of flavour. Adds a refreshing kick to the heavier pupusas. I usually order the pork pupusas or the beans-and-cheese. I haven't tried any of the other kinds, but I'm sure they are all very tasty. 

One of my favourite places to grab a bite in Kensington Market."}
{"text":"Their pupusas and tamales are amazing! Definitely going back to try everything on their menu at some point. They also have fun Mexican groceries up for grabs."}
{"text":"I was feeling adventurous and wanted to try something new in the area. I would not have walked into this place because it looks like a grocery store from the outside, luckily I knew there was a world of delicious food tucked just past the picnic tables and stairs. Place your order at the cash register once you've deciphered the menu, pass your ticket stub to the little lady in the back kitchen and be prepared to wait a while as your food is handmade in front of you. Try not to get in the way as people pick up and drop off their orders.

The wait is worth it though, even if it takes a good 20 minutes. I've never had pupusas before, and was surprised at the amount of meat she was able to stuff into the little pocket of dough. The texture of the outside is interesting, especially with it being fried to a crisp texture outside while still being moist and flavourful inside. A delicious meal and definitely a good introduction into Latin American food."}
{"text":"Five stars for these pupusas! They are absolutely divine. I had one today with pork, beans, and cheese, and it was better than any pupusa I've ever had before. Their horchata is also delicious. I had mine the Salvadorian way instead of the Mexican way, made with morro seeds instead of rice, and it was a refreshing drink for a hot day. I also tried a tamale with beans and cheese, which was just okay...it was way darker than other tamales I've had, so it might have been made of blue corn instead of yellow corn, but I'm not sure. It had a different taste than your average tamale - not bad, but not as great as the pupusas.

The pupusas come with an excellent cabbage salad similar to coleslaw and you can choose a mild or spicy sauce. They are also on the small side compared to other pupusas I've had before - I ordered one and probably should have gotten two. The food came out pretty quickly, maybe five minutes or so after I ordered (it wasn't very busy), and the staff are very friendly. This is my new go-to takeout spot when I'm around Kensington Market!"}
{"text":"I wanted to make Ajiaco, Colombian chicken soup.  It has some very specific ingredients, the hardest to find was guascas, a herb.  I gotta tell you, it is tough to find!  I knew Kensington was the place to go.  Everywhere I went though, no one knew what I was talking about.  After SIX stops in various shops I finally found my guascas at Latin American Emporium.  As the name implies, they have everything you would need for latin cooking. They also serve yummy treats in the back.  I'll be returning for sure."}
{"text":"I'm hungry and I'm ready to eat! Is this an Emporium with food?

I went to the Kensington Market looking for some good dinner. I was in the mood for some El Salvadorian food and I saw this place had pupusas. I was happy to see they had the pupusas but I soon found they did not have any rice or beans.  Hmmm...I thought it was a bit strange for a Latin place. I guess there are beans and rice in the burritos but you can't order them separately. 

The staff was friendly enough but our language barrier was a bit hard. When I ordered they forgot a chicken taco. When I asked for them to make it, they said they were closing. I ordered several things but the chicken taco was for my mom. So she had nothing to eat. I understand that they were closing but they should've finished our order first. We were even rushed out when we were eating. It probably would've been nice if they told us they were closing in 15 minutes and we would not be able to eat inside.

I think Latin Emporium's food was just ok. The pupusa was decent, and the yucca was deep fried a little more than I like. I usually like my plantains warm and they were served cold.

Lastly, I was a bit turned off with the two chickens that were above the food. It literally looked like two dead chickens on top where the food is prepared. There was a sign that said the roosters/chickens would rooster if you tip. It's cute but ummmm.... the chickens looked too real for me...especially when I'm eating chicken. Maybe have a different animal up there...

There are lot of places to eat at in Kensington Market, and the next time I am in Canada I most likely will try somewhere else."}
{"text":"Wow, I seriously never leave my neighborhood, b/c if I did then I would've known that:
a) this little gem existed
b) Kensington has all of a sudden* opened up a ton of latino places.

I went in there and ordered a vegetarian burrito and a churro.  Mmmmm mouthwatering goodness.  The burrito was a big size but manageable, I didn't have a food baby post burrito which is just the right size in my books.  It also wasn't especially greasy which was nice.  The churro was so delicious that I refused to eat anything else for hours just to help my mouth remember how yummy it was.  

The only reason I docked it 1 star was because the seating is less than ideal, especially b/c I so wanted to sit on a patio.  Still, definitely worth going in there.  Yummy!

*by all of a sudden I mean since 2001."}
{"text":"Best pupusas I've ever had. Be prepared to wait 15 or 20 minutes for your order as they are made fresh. I usually call ahead or leave and grab a few things in the market and come back cuz the seating is often scarce and cramped.  Tried their tacos and they were average so my advice is to stick to the papusas and leave the tacos to Seven Lives."}
{"text":"recently discovered, totally a fan.  We ordered the pork sopes with fresh pico cream and hot sauce....a little greasy but delish.  Loved being able to see the old ladies making them by hand too.  We also bought some corn tortillas and dried habaneros to make homemade hot sauce.  Will definitively be back to try more.  So far, hands down the best Mexican/Latin American cooking I've had so far in Toronto."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and it's a great place to get a few groceries and cooked food.  It's a no frills looking shop.  I've bought their tomatillos, hot sauce and spices, and tried revuelta and sausage pupusas and a dessert (I can't recall) several times.  My favourite so far is the revuelta pupusas.  One of the women there was very helpful by telling me how to make a traditional Mexican dish (pollo mole verde) I was trying to replicate that I use to get from an authentic Mexican restaurant that shut down.  The young staff, a guy and a girl are always very genuinely friendly, but the young guy goes out of his way to be helpful.  Prices seem reasonable too."}
{"text":"My second time coming to this place. When I was here for the first time, I bought hot & tasty churros. 

I was craving for something in the Kensington Market, so I came by to order food and get churros. 

**note: I was told by the young gentleman(by the cashier) that this place no longer sells churros. Nooooooo!!! :(  **

Food: I had two Colombian empanadas (veggies) and friend plaintain with cheese. The empanadas were so delicious- it was filled with potatoes, peas, corns and just a bit of spice. The hot sauce that was given was sooo delicious! 
The fried plaintain was surprisingly not too greasy. I was imagining a deep fried plaintain like tempuras. The cheese was gooey and the plaintain was warm, just the right temperature to savour.

Service: The young gentleman(by the cashier) showed me what some of the food looked like (e.g. empanadas, plaintains..etc). The lady in the kitchen asked me how I would prefer the food to be (hot? warm? with hot sauce or mild sauce?). She packed the food to go(at my request) in plastic containers and had utensils and napkins to go with it in one plastic bag. I love it when everything is in one place(otherwise I would lose things). 

Extra notes: 
1) This place is tiny, so if you are coming in with a big group, watch out for things around you. There is a large menu right before you go and order food, so look at that menu instead. 

2) There aren't that many seats here. From what I saw, you can likely sit with 3-4 other friends. 

3) This place accepts credit card and debit card. For credit card, you won't be charged a fee if your purchase is at least $6."}
{"text":"It's so funny to think that many moons ago when we use to live downtown, we would only go to Spadina Chinatown.  Being new immigrants to Canada, we had absolutely no interests in anything else that wasn't Chinese.  Dang I had such a depraved childhood!  There are sooo many great gems in the Kensington Market, that every time we are downtown we always try to go here instead of Chinatown so the roles have been reversed:)

Emporium Latino is such a great all in one store.  They sell a variety of Latino products such as authentic sauces, taco and tortilla shells, spices and peppers and even fried pork rinds!  But most people seem to be most attracted by their hot food area.  Serving a variety of Latino favourites such as pupusas, tamales, tostadas and tacos, the food here is authentic and homely.  Stuff you would probably find in a Latin American home.  We had the soup of the day (beef) and it was outstanding!  With big chunks of beef, tomatillos, carrots and cabbage, it's food that a Latin grandma would have made.

The store is a bit weird in that the seating area is part of a converted garage and you have to walk up the stairs to order.  Food took a bit long to get but was made to order and service was very friendly.

Overall a great place for Latino food in the Kensington Market!

4.5/5!"}
{"text":"This is not a restaurant, it is a latino grocery store.  But what a store.  They have a mavelous range of salsas, tortillas, beans, rice and everything else a latin kitchen needs.  They also sell hot food, you order at the checkout, hand the ticket ot the lady cooking and then hope one of the stools against the high shelf or bench at the front of the shop stays vacant for when you food is ready.  

This is very good food, not strictly Mexican, but very South of the Border, a little Salvadoran, a little Mexican, a little special.  I started off with a Salvadoran style chicken tamal, basically chicken and pressed potato cooked in a broad leaf and a couple of flautitas, which for you gingos are flutes of fried corn tortilla filled with yumminess.  They were very good, so good that I felt compelled to eat a pair of beef tostadas and two soft pork tacos.  The food here is superb, not superb in a grand restaurant way, but superb in a seriously authentic Latin American way.  Emporium Latino is now my second favourite Mexican (and El Salvadoran) restaurant in this fine city, Tacos El Asador, still hitting the number one spot.

I am also massively happy with the way that Kensington Market is turning into a little Mexico.  Every time I'm here there seems to be another Latin American place open, which can only be a very good thing."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today. It's been a long time since I have visited and it was nice to come back to the authentic taste of South America. This reminded me of my travels down south. The papusas were absolutely delicious, filled with beans and cheese just the way I like it. Also made fresh to order right infront of you. The salad is always fresh crispy and delicious, and their red hot sauce has the perfect amount of spice and flavour. Can't wait to go back, and so glad it is still amazing."}
{"text":"Traditional pupusas! Nothing but yummy fresh goodness here! 

Got the beans and cheese and beans only. I recommended only the beans. But regardless, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"If they had more seating, I would give this place a 4/5. When I am craving pupusas or tamales, I always make my way to Emporium Latino. The prices have gone up over the last year, but I think it is still good value. Pupusas are approximately $3 and they come with a salad and spicy (I mean spicy!) tomato sauce (they probably have mild too). If you are interested in buying items to go from their fridge such as queso fresco, chorizo and tamales, I would not go on a Sunday. I was there last Sunday and their fridge was pretty much empty. Lucky for me I was only interested in eating in. 

The way the ordering works is that you order and pay at the front cash, they write your order on a piece of paper that they rip off the number from the top of this piece of paper and then give you both pieces; you take the ticket/piece of paper with your order on it and you give it to the people cooking in the back and keep the other piece (it just has a number on it). Once your order is ready, they will call you and you give them the piece of paper with your order number. 

The seating situation is a pain! I was there with 6 people and we had to take turns eating. They have 6 chairs and it is bar-style. When you get there, if you are not alone and you see an empty seat, grab it and have someone else order for you. Though, you are better off buying your food to go and walking over to the park and making yourself a picnic. For a pupusa, tamal and a drink it will cost you around $10."}
{"text":"The people here are very nice. I I always hear about pupusas so I decided to give it a try.
I didn't particularly like it. I don't see what the big fuss is about. I also had plantain with guava and that was pretty cool. 

The people here so nice. They didn't have any chicken prepared to readily make the pupusas. They went and they prepared the chicken just for me.

The food is cooked fresh and authentic. I would give it a try. Support a great business."}
{"text":"This place has a unique charm,  and friendly service.  We ordered the beans and cheese pupusas and they are great.  The lady in the back is a pro! Super nice and great food  definitely going back!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for years, can't believe I haven't reviewed! Best pupusa (masa harina dough stuffed with cheese and/or meat and/or beans) in Kensington, $3 each with a heap of coleslaw dowsed in homemade hot (or sala verde if you ask nicely). They also have 5-8 kinds of tamales. I will often buy a dozen and take them home for the freezer."}
{"text":"We've been coming to Dona Cecilia's for a few years. I literally get HUNGRY for the pupusas, tamales and all the rest made here. Being an L.A. transplant, and a lover of Salvadoran, Ecuadorean and Mexican food (the real stuff) this is the one place in TO that serves it up true, delicious, autentico with great service. We even order way in advance for parties and everybody loves them. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Came here on a freezing Winter day with a friend in search of good cheap food (which is all over Kensington). The shop inside is small and there are about 6 seats in total? The seating area was right beside the door so we ate with our jackets and scarves on but the fresh steaming food warmed us right up!

There was a lot of rave about the Papusas so we got one and a Tamale. The Tamale was so delicious with a generous amount of stuffing and a crispy outer layer. But we found the Papusa to contain too much of the corn bread (or the breading that tasted like corn bread) and not enough stuffing, still delicious but too bread-y. 

The workers were very polite and helpful and made our experience feel really warm!"}
{"text":"Pupusas and horchata were good. Pastor taco & empanadas were average. Definitely go with the pupusas. Seem to have an extensive stock of dry goods."}
{"text":"It looks like everyone comes here for the pupusas. 

Well I've got news for you...they're not as good as they make them out to be.

The lady working the register is pretty cold although she answers your questions, it's not with a friendly demeanor. The order of things in here is so latin american and it made me love it. You order, you hand your order to an older lady that comes out from the back just to make you a fresh pupusa. 

But what's wrong with it? The pupusa had no flavor inside and out. Lacked a respectable amount of stuffing, the lettuce/cabbage and carrot shavings were dry, the salsa was okay. I'm sorry but when you're used to Atlacatl Restaurant out here in LA, my pupusas standards are going to be high.

The only pro is how you get to watch them be made and they're given to you on the spot.

Even though, the pupusa disappointed I have to respect the store aspect of Emporium Latino. They had so many hispanic essentials from all over latin america. Salsas, pancake flour, cooking oils, inca cola (their soda collection is legit), spices...they come through. If I lived in Toronto, I could see myself becoming a habitual customer of this place. 

Come and check it out, the pupusas aren't that great but if you've never had one, you can only go up from here. So it's a good place to start. Don't forget to lurk the store and take some tres estrellas pancake mix home with you."}
{"text":"every time I come to Emporium Latino I always find myself eating way too much. I really haven't found anything I don't like at this place and I always can't decide what I want so just end up ordering a bunch of stuff and walking out feeling like I'm going to explode, but always with a big smile"}
{"text":"If you like no thrills hidden gems, head over to this little shop in Kensington Market. It's a Latino grocery store with a little stand in the very back where you can order all types of pupusas for super cheap. I ordered the pork pupusa and after 3 minutes it was ready for me in a little bag Head to the seating on the first floor to enjoy the best pupusa of your life. If you don't like hole-in-the-wall places, don't go here. It's definitely not fancy, but soooooooooooooooooooooooooo worth it!"}
