{"text":"The best shawarma in town!!! Great pizza! Definitely a return customer I came in with friends and family great advice on food and everything we tried was great! Friendly staff and owner catered to our ever need!!"}
{"text":"Finally I have found my favorite place to eat in Las Vegas. Even though I was quite impressed by the quality of their food and service I didn't write a review that day. Visited them again today, and guess what...? Same quality and even better customer service. Five stars for sure Tasty Grill. I'm in love"}
{"text":"This is a new place. Pretty sparse decor but the food is delicious. I've eaten there twice. First time I had the Gyro sandwich. It was large and tasty. Much better than the average gyro. Price was under $5. Second visit I tried the chicken shawarma. Again the portion was large, roasted chicken nicely spiced with humus, rice, salad and a pita for under $10. Two of us are for less than $22 with a box take home. Great food, lots of it at a nice price. What's not to like. They are new and deserve support."}
{"text":"I had to convince my wife to try this place out. When viewed from the outside, it totally looks like a dive, however, what a diamond in the rough! Once we tried the food, we were definitely hooked! We normally aren't too thrilled about stuffed grape leaves and falafel, but this place really changed our minds in a hurry. We ordered a couple of platters to sample the food and every item we received were fantastic.

The hummus was prepared a bit differently from what we are accustomed, but great! 

If you have a hankering for Middle Eastern food, try this place out. It may not look great from the outside, however, the food is exceptional and the portions are generous with relation to the price."}
{"text":"It's a hidden gem! Very delicious food I've gone here at least 5 times tried different foods every time I've gone each time better than the last very good and affordable"}
{"text":"Its a very nice place. My family enjoyed the tasty food that was served. My favorite is the chicken dish, grape leaves, and kabab. I will definitely go frequently to that nice restaurant."}
{"text":"My family and I have came to this amazing place and we experienced some awesome family time.We love this place, it is so calm, and the food is outstanding, just outstanding. This restaurant is a family friendly location which turns out to a great family day. My family and I will be coming here again, for sure."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza! We got Birthday selebration pizza, GIANT 24in, very tasty, this was the best pizza I've ever had, great customer service, love this place, will be back soon"}
{"text":"The name speaks for itself. Great quality, fast and friendly service. Will recommend to try their Beef Shawarma."}
{"text":"I ordered the Philly cheese stake, it was very delicious and filling, the chili cheese fries tasted good but I thought they could have been better with more cheese. Over all it was well worth it. The delivery service was prompt and professional, I would definitely recommend this to anyone and will be back myself"}
{"text":"Decided to try this restaurant because it claims to have the \"best burger in Nevada\".  We ordered 4 burgers and the Philly cheesesteak. Service was extremely slow which was surprising since we were the only patrons in the restaurant. We ordered the burgers medium and they came out well done. The burger patties reminded me of the frozen patties from Costco. Buns were hard. Philly cheesesteak was on a burnt roll. Smelled like smoke in the restaurant because door separating the bar and restaurant does not seal tightly. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Great food. Have never been inside.. I always order it through postmates. Philly cheese steak is amazing. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I had the Marinated Beef Gyro and it was excellent along with side if fries! The homemade lemonade was delicious and I was glad I ordered the 32oz. However, the Zeppolis were very dry and tasted a little too chewy. The cinnamon made it hard to swallow the dough. Besides that it was great and will definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"Great service very nice people ! And the food ofcourse so tasty best kebabs in vegas I guarantee u. Order from tasty grill u won't regret ."}
{"text":"The food here is great and has never left me disappointed. The service can be slow, however the food is definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"The place is absolutely spectacular the cheese on the pizza is quality that you can taste and also the owners and employees there are very very friendly. This is hands-down one of the best pizza places in Las Vegas everyone needs to go there so that we can keep this place around the restaurants before this location were terriblebut this place  absolutely makes up for it come on guys let's keep this place going amazing pizza amazing service"}
{"text":"Tasty Grill catered an event I attended and the food, was in fact Tasty! However, I went to the restaurant to order and received horrible service from the Manager named Oscar. I went in to order and I was told by the Hostess that my food would be ready in 20-25 minutes. So I went to run a quick errand and when I returned at the 20 minute mark I was greeted by Oscar (the grouch). When I approached the counter he stated that my food wasn't ready and it would be another 20 minutes. When Oscar spoke to me it was extremely condescending, rude and disrespectful. He spoke to me as if I was beneath him. Since I had already waited 20 minutes I didn't want to wait another 20 minutes so I asked for a refund. He kept going on and on and trying to avoid the refund. He left mid sentence as I asked him again for a refund and came back and said my food would be ready in 5 minutes. I declined and asked for a refund again and this time for his bosses name. Turns out he is the manager and said the Owners didn't want to spend their time talking to the customers. (What???does he not know customers pay their wages) Oscar continued to pick an argument and really avoided trying to give me a refund. Finally I did get a refund, and he continued to speak rudely to me as I walked out. I definitely will not be eating there ever, and I will let the people who used their catering services know what poor service they provided to me."}
{"text":"Very nice waitress, impressive menu selection, and the best Beef Kabobs I ever tasted!  Meat so tender you can cut it with a spoon!  Never had Mediterranean Salad until today but it was awesome!"}
{"text":"I read the comments of that lady about tasty grill and what funny that I was there that day and I saw how respectful the owner was with that lady and what's more funny is that this lady didn't order any food but she was sitting 
with her friends that didn't complain at all . All customers were watching get that lady because she was so noisy. I saw the owner offered that table a free food and every one heard the owner saying your bill is on me, what else the owner can say if the customer is not happy I'm not trying to defend the owner but I want to be fair. All customers were telling the owner just take it easy don't even worry. And by the way the people at that table order grill and for sure it is going to take more than 25 minutes for grill. I'm happy as a customer at tasty grill."}
{"text":"By far the greatest small grill in Vegas all homemade and the best service I've ever had"}
{"text":"I ordered the beef shish kabob plate and the rice was soggy like paste, there was also hardly any meat just 5 small cubes of overcooked beef. Only reason I'm giving two stars instead of one is the prompt delivery and friendly service"}
{"text":"I was there last night with my fiance and gotta tell you food was amazing!!! The build out for this pizzeria is interesting... its inside the bar but completely seperated,has a vibe of a open floor restaurant. Great for parties and events.The pickup special pizza and kebabs are must try,salads are fresh and huge portions.Good luck guys with your newly established restaurant congrats on your Grand Opening and keep up the great work."}
{"text":"They messed up our order so bad!! They left off things we PAID to be added. Sent the wrong flavor wings and there was a large piece of plastic inside of the ranch. We called to complain and the manager said he added a $5 credit to our account (which honestly wasn't sufficient in my opinion) but we left it at that. A week later we call to give them another chance and redeem our credit only to be told we \"DON'T have a credit, oh the manager just left and sorry I'm just an employee\" NEVER returning."}
{"text":"Omg finally i have a place where I can go and eat my favorite chicken lula kabob and lamb gyro. This place is awesome customer service is the best. Which restaurant would give you a free cheesecake just because you are checking in? Delivery is fast and they only charge  $2.50 delivery fee. This place is owner operated and the place is very nice and clean . Highly recommend to try everything they have in the menu ."}
{"text":"Really friendly service, quality food. Only reason for knocking off a star is because we came in really craving a good Gyro. They are a lil stingy with the meat and it felt like a lot of fillers were heavy but the meat (best part) was not generous. I don't know if I would order one again but if I did, I'd definitely ask for more meat to be added."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely ridiculous when it comes to fixing small issues. I ordered $4 worth of Thousand Island dressing in which Ranch was sent. I immediately called the restaurant as soon as I saw what was delivered. I was then told by the woman on the phone what I liked on my salad and that it was what I ordered. I had to stop her and inform her you cannot tell me what I like. I was then told by her her manager would call me back. He obviously had no customer service skills either. His solution was we will give you a $4 credit and go ahead and eat what you ordered because it's okay you can eat it. Again how do you tell a customer what they like to eat. I could be allergic to a ranch ingredient. This entire ordering experience was horrible not to mention it taking over an hour to get one pizza, salad, & $4 worth of the wrong dressing. So if you have an issue with this so called place of business don't expect a fair and good solution provided by good customer service. I wish it was a zero star rating because who wants to wait an hour for the wrong items."}
{"text":"This place has great food and excellent service. Everything is always delivered on time and you can't beat the price for the food portions."}
{"text":"This place does mostly take out and delivery, but we ate in. Both dishes were great. Son had burger. It was a 2 fister, and very juicy. Came with lots of fries. I had beef Shoah kabob. Very flavorful! The hummus was very good, and the salad was dressed with lemon and mint. I would eat there every week if I lived in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Let's just start by saying WOW!! My husband and I ate here 2 days in a row! First of all they seem to be the only place in Vegas open late! And the food was BOMB we had the cheesesteak the zucchini sticks and the burger everything was amazing both times the food was on point !!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service.. I had the gyro lunch special.  Really good.  Although the restaurant is not directly in the bar, the cig smoke smell is  noticeable."}
{"text":"Bad ass fries, burgers, and Mediterranean dishes , but not too impressed with the pizza and the smoke in the dining area because it's attached to Putter's gaming . Will definitely be coming back if I am craving for the above dishes."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon Tasty Grill completely by luck and I almost regret it as I had probably the best sandwich/pita I've ever had. The regret comes from being out of state so we'd have to fly 1500 miles to comeback. Bummer. 
BTW- the service was perfect too!"}
{"text":"Aaamazing Shawarma Chicken Sandwich! By far one of the best I've ever had at a very good price and I've tried plenty of places in Los Angeles. Their Cannoli was also delicious and fresh. The customer service is exceptional and the food was delivered exactly when promised. I'm excited to try more items on their menu."}
{"text":"If l can give 0 point , l will give them \"0\". We have a birthday party right now , we called them 3 days ago for 3 pizza delivery for a birthday party which will be today for 1.30 pm. It's 2.40 pm right now , 3 times we called them finally we just had our pizza more than 1 hour late. Terrible service and delivery guy said ' you didn't say delivery' are you kidding guys???? Of course we told you that this is for a birthday delivery. Terrible service , we will never order a pizza from over there . Definitely l don't recommend this place"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get meat ball spaghetti, because it is the best in town. Spaghetti is filled with spices and match perfectly with their house red sauce. Normally restaurant will not be packed and that is not the only thing I like there, service also nice (sometime might be owner), Hope this hidden GEM will stay in vegas forever."}
{"text":"I was so glad I decided to give this place a try. As the name says, the food was tasty! Fries were very crispy good flavor, as well as gyro and the philly steak. Also the ranch is made in house and is perfect. The food is affordable and the manager takes serious pride in making sure customers are satisfied and happy. You can tell he is passionate about his business. Great job tasty grill, I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"So I ordered here through eat 24
On my lunch at around 3:04pm the est time was 15-35 mins I head out get there 30 mins later the guys says he replied back to the order update 45 mins for the food to be done and it will be 10 mins and my food will be completed now I'm not happy but I accept it. We sit here another 10 mins and another guys comes out and says that our food will be another 10 mins I say wait a minute it was said in the update 45 mins we are not at that time and now you say 10 more mins I have to be back to work and it's over the time I just want to cancel my order and I'm am going to let my co workers know not to come here as they don't have your food on time He continues to argue with me on how much time they have and they updated it to 45 mins at 8 after and this is after I was give. My initial time frame I again tell him when I put in my order what it said and he continues to argue with me I finally have to tell him just let me know when my food is done and he is still continuing to argue with me. One think I can't understand is how they were busy no one but us was there and 1 order went out the door. I have not tried the food as I don't have time to eat it because o am late back to work but based on my experience I will NEVER eat here again"}
{"text":"Best Philly Cheese Steak in town. I ordered 2 for me and my husband. Had it delivered by Postmates. It was hot, fresh and so tasty. They chop up the meat, peppers and onions really well so its easy to eat and they use cheese wiz on theirs which I've been trying to find in this town forever! This will definitely be on the take out rotation. It came with crispy battered dipped fries which were done perfect."}
{"text":"Edit after owner response: 
During one of our calls (the 3rd call, I believe) with the restaurant, we specifically asked if the issue was with the restaurant or with UberEats. Your employee said that it was the restaruant's problem, because of the other large orders. Please do not try to put the blame on UberEats. We did not receive a call from Tasty Grill until almost an hour after we had ordered - a call that should have been made immediately so we could have cancelled our order. The people we spoke with on the phone kept saying \"20 more minutes,\" even though it ended up taking another hour and a half."}
{"text":"Second Review

I absolutely recommend this hidden jem! I can go on and on with nothing but good to say,  the food is Top Notch, just make you feel good delicious!! A must!"}
{"text":"I have ordered from Tasty Grill numerous time and the food has been consistent. I typically order pizza, wings, fries, mozerella sticks, garlic knots and every single time it has been great! The customer service is great as well! I usually order and have it delivered but the last time I went in to pick up the food. I was amazed at how clean the dining area was! The floor and tables were squeaky clean with no crumbs on the floor. I was super happy about that. I recommend this place to others!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Garlic Parmesan wings & they're out of this world good! Definitely can't wait to order them again & try other things on the menu"}
{"text":"Very good food and very friendly owner. I eat here twice a month for lunch. I love the mixed kabob and also the baklava is the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"This place has good food I can't lie, but the customer service is where it lacks. It's been awhile since we have ordered from them and it's when they were partnering with uber eats, they've made multiple mistakes on my orders but could not do anything about it because it was \"uber eats\" fault. That I don't agree with because it was the restaurant preparing orders not the uber driver. And when I called to complain more than once, they couldn't do anything about it. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Awesome Philly Cheese Steak! Will definitely be back. Roxy gave us excellent service!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have ordered delivery from here twice now. Its so convenient, about 45 mins to an hour for delivery. The first time we ordered potato skins, mozzarella sticks, bacon burger, meatball sub, curly fries with cheese wiz and bacon, and a side of regular fries. Everything was hot and tasted great. We were, honestly, surprised at how good everything was. We will definitely be ordering again!"}
{"text":"In few words i want to say this place is AWESOMEwe go to Tasty grill every Wednesday to eat philly cheese steak. They're steak is the best in Las Vegas , and the owner is very friendly. 
The food is very fresh and tasty ."}
{"text":"SO GOOD! I guess this place just re-opened or is under new management - They dropped off a menu a few days ago, so I thought I'd give em a try - Glad I did! I ordered the chicken gyro and it was delicious! Fries were really good too!! Definitely will be ordering from here again. They delivered rather quickly for it being the lunch hour too!"}
{"text":"Horrible ordering system! Ordering online is just a waste of time. If you order online, you still need to call in to confirm your order. How are you suppose to know that this is necessary if there is no indication to do so on the website. On top of that they tried to comfort me by saying the special I ordered has been expired for 6 months now, but they'll honor the price of the deal. Are you kidding me?!?! You just admitted you're incompetent enough to not manage your business' website for 6 months, and I'm suppose to know that I have to call in to confirm my order?!?! Get it together people!"}
{"text":"Best pizza over the town, we order couple of times per week. It always come with good portion and good price. Do the pick up special, such a steal!!!"}
{"text":"So now that we have ordered here a few times I am pretty content doing a positive review. I also think this will be one of our new places to order from.

Absolutely love their lunch specials , their calzones are delicious and wings as well. They even offer their lunch specials for delivery through yelpeat. Love that they have a low delivery charge fee .

Every time we have ordered , the food has been so great and the orders have been so accurate. This is a huge deal as most places always get at least one thing wrong. 
Service has always been great.

I will say my only thing is they are stingy with the ranch. Even with an order of 20 wings one one sharable ranch. (There large size but not very large)

Other than that amazing. Will definetly continue to order from here!"}
{"text":"I went here the other day with my son and had a very tasty experience. I ordered the chicken shawarma and my son got the kafta sandwich. 

The chicken tasted great as did the rice. I got this dish other places but this was the best by far. Even though I was stuffed my son and I got these little dessert pastries they were different yet fantastic. 

I think we spent $20 total on our meal which was a pleasant surprise. Great taste and best value in Chandler Mall by far. Glad we tried out this new spot. I'll be back like the terminator... terminator of tasty food that is."}
{"text":"Food was good , had the pickup special and sampler appetizer . Ton of food . Would definitely be back ."}
{"text":"Ordered here for the first time 11:30pm on a Friday nite--ordered the buffalo wing medium and the chicken lula kabob plate ---I know it was close to closing but delivery was on time, the wings were a bit soggy for me so I crisped them up in the broiler and then they were good (not great but not at all bad, just average) I suppose you could ask for them \"well done\" to avoid this but I didn't want to assume, being it was my first time ordering. The chicken lula kabob was a long cylindrical ground chicken \"sausage\" and was quite tasty  --came in a plate with rice and a Mediterranean salad and hummus --the hummus was ok, lacked flavor, same with the dressing for the salad ---I also ordered a side of onion rings --those were pretty good. Overall not a bad experience but nothing that made me want to order again other than the fact that they are open later than other places --can't speak to their pizza though --but not a bad experience if you are in need of late night food with no options!"}
{"text":"It was just okay I wasn't overly impressed next time I will try something diff like their pizza! But their customer service was outstanding"}
{"text":"We ordered delivery almost 3 hours ago. Your service sucks! Whoever answered the phone kept lying saying the food was on the way. Food still hasn't left your restaurant. Talked to someone again in the phone. Food still hasn't left p and all you offered was small discount. Keep your discount and at this point it should be free. We order food all the time but definitely won't be from Tasty Grill ever again!  You are officially on the banned list and I will make sure everybody I know, knows about it!"}
{"text":"I usually come in for food, this time I decided for delivery.  Not only was the delivery guy 20 minutes late but the salad came warm.   Delivery time is supposed to be 45-1hr and he showed up 20 minutes past that 1hr mark. Also they forgot to mention that they charge 5.50$ to deliver, if I knew that I wouldn't of tipped the driver and I would of just simply picked it up.  I called back and asked why she didn't tell me that it's a 5.50 delivery charge, and she said \"we're not required to tell you that information\" in an extremely rude tone. Excuse me? Are you freaking kidding me? And why did your delivery guy think it's a good idea to put pizza and salad on top of each other together? I would of never tipped the delivery guy if I have known about the 5.50$ delivery charge from the beginning, and I would of simply just drove and picked it up from this place instead, and I would of had a cold salad instead of the warm soggy salad.  Truly disappointed in this place."}
{"text":"If you're tired of going to pizza places and ordering wings with plain hot sauce, then come here! I always order wings with HOT sauce and it's never hot to me. But the wing sauce here tastes like they made it themselves. You can actually see the seasoning and the chili flakes within the sauce. 
The pizza was great; just the right amount of crisp! 
I definitely will order from here again."}
{"text":"This restaurant is closed. Too bad as there are not many other middle eastern restaurants near by."}
{"text":"Found this place because it was one of the only places open when I was craving pizza late one night. The pizza was so good that I've ordered from this place multiple times since.
Food is always hot and fresh. It has been late once, but even though it showed up late the food itself was still hot. Haven't had a chance to order anything else from this place but I would recommend giving their pizza a try!"}
{"text":"The \"Tasty Grill\" is absolutely Tasty! Everything I tried was phenomenal! We ordered the \"chicken lula kabob plate\" it was delicious!!! The Sampler appetizer was good as well! This restaurant really does live up to its name! It was quick and easy delivery and our delivery guy was so nice! I will definitely be eating here again soon! Maybe today! Lol & what other restaurant gives you a free piece of cheesecake for checking in! It's dine in only so I will be eating there next time, just for some cheesecake!"}
{"text":"Delivery was fast and arrived before the time Eat24 indicated! Had the fingers, curly fries and a pizza (half sausage and half mushroom/green pepper) was very delicious! Looking forward to trying other dishes from Tasty Grill! Thank you!"}
{"text":"This was the first I've been here and I really liked it here. The area is very clean and the costumer service was excellent, also let's not forget about the food which was very delicious and good. I'll definitely be coming here more often and I highly recommend this place to other people."}
{"text":"Toan was a really nice guy. I appreciate his conversations, his cartoons playing, and his service. He was a very gracious host and it was nice to turn 27 here. Thanks. Fries were dank."}
{"text":"I'm glad that Tasty Grill is a short, convenient drive from where I live! It's my go-to food place, especially if I'm entertaining guests from out-of-town.

Well-lit and always clean. So many choices and all reasonably priced.

{"text":"Omg!!! The food here is sooooooo good! Super fresh, delicious flavors, and a broad variety menu to satisfy any taste or craving! Oh, and they deliver! I had the Chicken Shawarma sandwich and boy did it hit the spot! This is a family owned business where they really put their heart into not just making good quality food, but also keeping a clean family friendly environment that will definitely make you come back. Good prices, great food, excellent service! Awesome all around experience! We will most definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Yummy yummy I order delivery from them and it's always good! Want to try more items on the menu! Love all the options!"}
{"text":"Visting from California and i'm so glad i stopped here to try their food , I ordered beef shish kabob and my fiancé got chicken shawarma it was so tasty , best customer service , great atmosphere, friendly stuff. I will highly recommend this place to anyone . Even got my free cheesecake, it was just great ."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service. Waited 25 minutes for a simple salad. The lettuce in my salad was not properly washed. Many upset customers, and staff did not seem to care about the complaints (wait time, wrong orders after they repeated their orders several times, bad service). Will not be returning again. Thoroughly disappointed."}
{"text":"Good food/portion size
Low cost
Great customer service
Food delivered hot and fresh

Overall, we were pleased with our first experience with this restaurant. We'll definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"I tried the lamb gyro with a side of onion rings and nachos and it was perfect to say the least. Service was great and the staff were very welcoming. thank you tasty grill!"}
{"text":"I love their burgers, fries, and packaged cheesecake. Their service is good and I like their delivery."}
{"text":"The food was good,  and we got 10% off and a free slice of cheesecake for checking in on yelp but I have to give 3 stars because they don't have any high chairs or booster seats for children! It's such a hassle to go out to eat somewhere with a one year old who tries to stand, run and grab everything if he's not in a high chair. So unfortunately we couldn't even enjoy our food because I had to hold my son the whole time. If you have small kids, I wouldn't recommend this place. Hopefully  they invest in some high chairs for the convenience of their guests.."}
{"text":"My daughter and I had dinner the restaurant was totally empty. We had the hummus for appetizer which had way to much garlic not good I had a bacon cheeseburger which had no bacon and my daughter had a gyro if you really know Greek food a gyro doesn't have lettuce on it. My daughter said it wasn't good at all.i ordered a pizza to go for my son and I had a taste I was descent for the price."}
{"text":"The pizza was good. Great employees.  Pasta was not good, tasted like the put cumin in the sauce..."}
{"text":"Great place! Their cheesesteak is the best I've had!! Delicious fries and ranch . Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"This restaurant is totally a hidden gem! If you love some classic juicy pizzas this is the place. Walking in we were warm greeted by the staff and service was excellent. The food is the real reason why I thought this place was exceptional we had a special pizza prepared by their chef and oh my god it totally OFF the charts??This pizza toppings were perfect very light and strongly sensing, it's also got some of the best sauce all over the whole pizza. Totally worth giving it a shot"}
{"text":"I did not hesitate to give this place 5 stars. Everything was fresh and delicious. I already cannot wait to come back. The waitress was so nice and attentive. I highly recommend ordering the lamb gyro or the mushroom Swiss burger. I promise you won't be disappointed if you try anything here."}
{"text":"Let's start by saying this is located inside Putters bar and grill, at the intersection of Durango Rd and Flamingo Rd.  It's the same plaza as Lost in the 50's Automotive.

Very nice casual decor, comfy booths, nice large Samsung television to watch while you wait for your order. Spotless tables and floors, clean as  a whistle.

I came in today at Friday August 26th at about 4 PM.  My boyfriend and I had a flyer at the house for this place and he said he was craving a Philly Cheesesteak.  I remembered about the flyer and said they had Phillies right around the corner from the house.

Our waiter was a splendid guy to meet.  Very knowledgeable of the menu and suggested to try their Philly with cheese wiz.  We wanted to stay with an appetizer which we tried the loaded potato skins, Mm mm!

When the Philly was up it was succulent lyrics juicy!  It was perfectly cooked to  a nice light crunchy bun.  You can tell whomever was cooking paid close attention to the food and appearance. Some folks can easily overcook the thinly sliced meat. Which that was not the case.  We loved their crispy curl fries too. Very reasonably priced for the portions.

We left stuffed, I see they have a $6.99 lunch special Monday - Friday from 11 AM until 3 PM. Our waiter mentioned the pick up special.  $7.99 sixteen inch one topping pizza!  They also deliver, freakin' awesome."}
{"text":"Delivery takes a while but its worth it.Food is extremely yummy and the people who work here are so nice. The delivery driver was very very kind. It's not too expensive here and the portions are big enough to have left overs. Overall 5/5 stars i will be coming back :)"}
{"text":"Ordered two pizzas and wings. Pizza tasted really good. It was a little light on the sauce but the dough was fantastic. Wings were cooked perfectly. Sauce was super spicy and wings were large. Overall a great dinner that didnt break the bank."}
{"text":"Decided to do a take out night and found their flyer. After looking over the menu we decided to try it. I gave a call and placed a delivery order ( too lazy to drive there). 
The lady on the phone was nice and even gave me 10 percent off for being a new customer. 
The food took about 45 minutes to arrive but the driver was super nice. Here is the scoop on the food:
Breaded mushrooms are awesome and come with ranch for dipping...only complaint is that there are not enough for the price.
Pickle fries are a spicy treat that you must try.
Philly cheese steak was good but meat seemed   a little thin compared to the roll. You really do not taste the peppers or cheese.
Burgers are awesome and huge with good amount of fries.
The beef shishkabob plate was a good size but overcooked.

For the price it was a good amount of food. It cost about $60 including tip for 4 people.
If you want easy take out, you should give it a taste."}
{"text":"Great food with outstanding service this food is freshed cooked to order so not fast food  the owner is such a super lady it makes this one of my favorite places to eat Mona is the owner and cook and has such passion for her craft"}
{"text":"Yeah. This place. This place is amazing. I'll openly admit this is my go to place for late night eats. It doesn't disappoint. I've ordered from here three times. I am pretty sure the owners answer the phones and deliver the food. They're extremely friendly. 

My favorite item this far is the chicken fingers with garlic parmesan sauce. Holy cow! It is a creamy sauce they pour over the chicken fingers. It is unique and extremely tasty. 

Their onion rings, for whatever reason, are very very good. Beer battered and with lots of flavor. 

I've also ordered pizza from here and was very happy with it. They go heavy on the toppings! You definitely feel like you get your money's worth. I've also ordered they're appetizer sampler platter. They have fried mushrooms, fried zucchini, jalapeno poppers, mozzarella sticks and onion rings. It comes with really flavorful marinara sauce and ranch. Everything in the platter is good but not quite as noteworthy as the fingers. 

I highly recommend. Very good value as well."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here to eat before going to the movies next door. He insisted that it was bomb food and I had to try it.. I got a gyro supreme and I must admit it was delicious.. they are not stingy with the meat and it is very delicious. 

The decor is simple and most people think that matters but it doesn't. Don't pay attention to the decor, that won't make the food taste any different. It is a family owned business and it's a must at very good affordable prices."}
{"text":"The food was good. I had a gyro salad. They were not stingy with the meat! Next time I probably would order the dressing in the side, too much for my preferences. 
 
Why not a 4 star rating? The meat was dry and so was my friend's chicken. 

I will definitely be going back for more."}
{"text":"Service is a bit crappy. I went to go pick up a pizza and when I arrived, there was no one there. I waited about 5 min and an employee came out. She looked at me and said, oh, nobody is out front and then walked away from me. No one came out for another 5 min. I waited about 10min up front for someone to come out. I was actually debating to leave because I did not want to be late for work. When I tried to call, the lady put me on hold for a while and so I had to call back again. I figured they were busy, but when I walked in, it was empty and it seemed pretty slow. Another turn off? They had music blasting, so they can't even hear customers coming in. Not sure if I'll come back..."}
{"text":"this was my first time trying this place and i have to say it was very good food. great service, lots of good choices. i would recommend to people to try it, i would go again."}
{"text":"Will definitely come back to Tasty Grill! Food was fresh and very good and the service is amazing. Very friendly atmosphere and delicious food."}
{"text":"Just finished eating my takeout. Never again will I step foot in this restaurant. 

First impression walking in the place reeks of smoke. 

After placing my order I was notified I'll be charged a $1 fee for using a credit card. (So unprofessional)

On Yelp I checked in to receive a free piece of cheesecake. After talking two her twice about it they still forgot the free cheesecake. 

This is after listening to these two employees arguing over what they should be charging customers. 
 
Once home I was excited to eat my meatball parmesan sub. I was quickly disappointed that the meatballs tasted like a rubber ball. I'm thinking they've been sitting in the back for awhile. 

My wife did say her pizza was ok once she was able to use paper towels to get all the grease off. 

I will say the jalapeño poppers were pretty good. 

Do yourself a favor and just keep driving to the next local place. This is the only bad one we've come across in this area."}
{"text":"Ran into this place while getting my car done next door and was blown away with this hidden gem!  

I've tried 4 different dishes there and each of them were the tastiest food for its price range that I've had in Las Vegas.  The calzone was a ridiculously fantastic blend of Italian meeting a hint of Greek.  The shawarma was exceptional with a great plate variety and really well marinated and cooked meat.  Portions are plentiful, and service was attentive.  Highly recommend and looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"I order from this place whenever i crave for shawarma and so far this is my favorite. 
Service: Polite, nice and great employees.
Food: delicious, unique and reasonable pricing
Delivery/pick up: always on time if not early. Never had any problem with drivers.
I highly recommend this place if you are looking for great mediterranean food."}
{"text":"I ordered a spaghetti with meatballs and chickens today. The portion is HUGE, and the food are EXCELLENT good. Especially the garlic bread and the meatballs. The chef and the boss are really nice and professional. Definitely will come back soon."}
{"text":"Always delicious food, I have never been disappointed. Their customer service is just absolutely amazing which makes it all together a great experience !"}
{"text":"Take-out Review:

Called to place order over the phone. I asked for hummus with veggies and the guy said \"yes we have the hummus platter, hummus with veggies\". I asked what veggies it came with and he listed off a handful of veggies so I said ok cool I'll take that. 

When I got home and opened my platter I was surprised to see a heap of cooked vegetables with some type of grain mixed in. 

Ok so maybe there was a lack of understanding, slightlyyyyy understandable, but honestly the taste of the veggies was extremely poor. The jumble of oily veggies all had a soggy and uniform taste. The \"broccoli\" was the stem pieces only, and the salt level was about the same as you could imagine a jar of olives. I ended up eating my pita dipped in the hummus. 

The Tzatziki kind of tasted like it was mixed with blue cheese... 
 
We also ordered the wings and fries which my friend said tasted good! Everything including my veggies were nice and hot which I appreciate. They seem to have a mixed menu of Mediterranean and bar food."}
{"text":"I have to say,delicious food. I had the tasty n juicy cheeseburger n the wings were excellent. I've had a hard time finding good food since I moved here.... I love this place n will be a returning customer.thank u tasty grill"}
{"text":"Saw this place on Yelp and decided to give it try considering it's open until 12am and had a huge menu with tons of variety! They have every kind of food: Italian, Mexican, American, and Greek. To me, this usually means that they have a wide variety of mediocre food. When a restaurant tries too hard to be good at too many things, usually it turns out bad. In the case of tasty girl, it seems like they have it down. Although we stuck the the American side of things, the food was good! Can't speak for the other types of food but we got the wings, mozzarella sticks, zucchini sticks, wings, and mac and cheese bites and it was all very tasty. I'm definitely looking forward to trying out more items on the menu in the future. For the food aspect, I would say it's pretty good. As for the service, it was mediocre and the reason for the missing star. My boyfriend and I were the only people in the restaurant at the time and there was only one employee working the front. Every time we needed something we had to get up and get it (never got our drinks and had to ask for them, refills, to go boxes, condiments, etc.). Mind you, the guy was alone and it seemed like they were getting a lot of to go orders and post mate orders so I get it, but the service just wasn't there. Overall I would say that if you're looking for a late night bite and a place with pretty much every kind of food I would recommend ordering it to be delivered or pick it up and take it home to enjoy it."}
{"text":"I'm sure a place like this has plenty of loyal customers and I'm another one now... these portions are HUGE and good.. also I was informed their ranch is home made. Who doesn't love a little extra love made fresh for your food. :) I can't wait to return and try new items on their menu"}
{"text":"Another successful find with the recommendation of Yelp! This place is connected to a Putters Bar so I thought I would not be able to sit down and enjoy lunch with my kids but I was wrong! They have a wall that separates the bar from the actual restaurant so you can sit down with your family and enjoy their yummy food! 

They have Philly's with actual cheese wiz! My kids loved it along with the fat cheesy mozzarella sticks! The zucchini sticks were cut perfectly, not too thick but not too skinny either! I had the chicken gyro which was good and will suffice when I can't get across town to Acropolis. I think next time I will try the Lamb gyro (which they don't at Acropolis). 

The restaurant was nice and quiet so the kids and I were able to enjoy our lunch and quantity time together. The waitress herself was busy with phone orders, it seems this place is popular for deliveries. She was awesome, I had mentioned that it was our 1st time visiting and that we enjoyed it and to my surprise I was given a 10% first visit discount! We will definitely be back as this place is conveniently located in our neighborhood.

*******************************
Visited to dine in for the 2nd time and it was delicious as expected! Ordered new items, beef shish kabob plate, lamb gyro and curly cheez wiz fries with bacon! All delicious! Received a free cheese cake just for checking in on Yelp!"}
{"text":"This place has the best Pizza and service with. Smile. Everything we have had so far we love.  A must try."}
{"text":"Love the burgers there normally.  Went there today to find a dirty restaurant.  Hard to eat there when I feels so dirty."}
{"text":"Tasty Grill is the place to go! Their wings are so Bomb! I definitely recommend this place they always play cool movies and it's a such a chill vibe! Good food and good service!!!!!!"}
{"text":"It was ok. I got the cheese whiz cheesesteak and it was average. I like Capriottis better."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times; food is good, and quality of service is usually great. We called in an order and was told 20 minutes, arrive in about fifteen and didn't mind waiting the remaining time. After an extra 30 minutes of waiting I asked for an update and was rudely dismissed with another 5 minutes."}
{"text":"A very good place to find Mediterranean food
In the beginning I was hesitating but after trying the food I was very please with the flavor and overall experience was good. 
Also the price is very fair to the amount of food that you get. 
I do recommend this place"}
{"text":"Super good food!
Philly cheesesteak was amazing. 
Sampler snd garlic knots were amazing 
Chicken kebab was amazing 
Super nice customer service 
These guys are really nice and gave us free dessert

My friend and I were visiting from California we definitely want to come Back and eat here again"}
{"text":"OMG I've been here 5 times in the last 5 days. From the cheesesteak to the wings are top notch and I'm from philly. I wish I can give this place 10 stars because guess what it's open late also. The food is seasoned just right. The staff is friendly which is a plus and the food is always fresh. I must admit, I'm addicted to the food. Would definitely recommend tasty grill any day of the week. 10 stars in my book."}
{"text":"Ordered online right on time great food for the price can't complain plus delivery fee was only 3 dollars. Out here for EDC perfect way to carb up before the big event."}
{"text":"Fast delivery, great customer service, and amazing food! Order was exactly what we wanted to the T. They delievered before we even expected the food to arive. Overall very satisfied. Thank you guys! Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"I ordered from here via yelp a few days ago. Tried something out of my wheel house. Hot here under the time they had posted and was hot. I'm not a fan of white rice but the rest of my plate was really taster. At some point might try their burgers as well. I put additional directions on the site and they found me."}
{"text":"This place has great food! Burgers are tasty hence the name... Tasty Grill mmmmm. They have gyros, kabob, pizzas & fresh salads!!! I eat there about once a week, location is convenient & they're open late."}
{"text":"My husband and I had Philly cheesesteak's and I have to say they were very good and worth every single penny ! We will be back for sure !"}
{"text":"Love this place . Great pizza !!! Food is always fresh. Service goes out of their way to deliver. Not to expensive. If you are looking for a late night meal . This is the place to go ."}
{"text":"Apparently, this place has a new ownership, Tasty Grill by Bing Gyros, but since the chef is the same, no change in the quality of the food.  I tried many items from the menu, and so far cannot find any cons. We tried last week chicken pizza and beef shawarma, both were very good.  
I like their food because it's delicious and affordable at the same time.  definitely will go there again."}
{"text":"I was waiting on DMV and I drive by and found this place.the staff was very nice and friendly and the pizza was amazing you must try"}
{"text":"The food here is very much bang for your buck. I ordered a Philly cheese steak with fries. The fries were some of the soft and crunchiest I've ever had! The Philly cheese steak was a bit on the salty side but was good regardless. I'd highly recommend this place if you're looking for a good, cheap eat that doesn't compromise on taste or serving size."}
{"text":"Well i dont know how this place has 4 stars
Imagine being back in middle school and the schools hot lunches came from a 'roach coach'
Sad
And kinda gross 
Microwaved food

Anyways I don't want to make a huge deal outta this very boring meal but we ordered the nachos which was a pitiful excuse for nachos, like bowling alley snak style... A jumbled pile of chips, some red onion, and some Velveeta cheese layered just on top

I had asked to not pay for these since we ate only 3-4 chips each they said they couldn't do that...

Take your money elsewhere your taste buds and tummy will thank-you."}
{"text":"New Year's Day aka national hang over day and what better way to celebrate by delivery pizza via Eat24! Yelp delivery recently saved my life with some delicious pizza and breaded mushrooms via Tasty Grill. The order even arrived sooner than expected which was nice.

The pizza was essentially like most other Vegas pizza joints, but I did really enjoy their sauce. The crust was evenly cooked and pepperonis were spread out nicely, not overloaded. Can't say I had any complaints. The mushrooms were good standard fried deliciousness too along with a side cup of homemade ranch. 

I've found another viable pizza option which is never a bad thing. I can't wait to try some of their other tasty morsels."}
{"text":"Always trying to find a new place to check out, my office ordered from here today. We ordered a 10\" white pizza ($11), a 10\" calzone with meatballs and pepperoni ($11), a philly cheesesteak and fries ($10), a cheeseburger and fries ($8), an order of 5 mild hot chicken fingers with blue cheese ($9) and an order of 12 garlic parmesan wings ($10).
  The white pizza was delicious becauses I love ricotta, crispy crust and greasy pizza! The calzone was tasty as well. My co-worker had me try the garlic parmesan wings and wasn't too happy with them. They thought they tasted \"fishy\", and I could definitely see what they were talking about. I don't know if it was just the sauce they used or maybe perhaps they also use the fryer to fry seafood products, but we were not fans of the garlic parmesan wings.  
  My other co-workers really enjoyed the philly cheesesteak, cheeseburger and hot chicken fingers. We'll order from here again!"}
{"text":"Ordered yesterday and loved the food. Ordered again today and the food wasn't prepared as I requested....I think BBQ sauce, bacon, cheese and meat only is pretty specific. They didn't want to refund my money....their loss as I'm the main person in my office ordering lunches for 10-12 people. All over $9.99. Hope it was worth it Mr. Owner. Funny you made no mention of the rest of my order where I said BBQ sauce, bacon, meat and cheese only. Doesn't that say it all?"}
{"text":"The food here is really good and the service is nice and attentive! My favorite is the breaded mushrooms and my mom loves the chicken wings. They have giant 24\" pizzas too for a good price! Also, they're open pretty late so it's good for my mom and I to come here after work ^.^"}
{"text":"This place is ok.  I got off late from work and was starving and they were close.  The fried foods (fries, rings, etc) aren't that great to-go.  They were cold and in general didn't have very good flavor.  I ordered the philly.  It wasn't too bad but a little over priced for what I got.  Overall it was food and I was hungry.  Wouldn't choose to go here again though."}
{"text":"The manager's appearance is a good indicator on the cleanliness of the restaurant. Delivery service took 2 hours. Our food arrived cold and my fries were soggy. Gyros have hardly any meat at all making it seem like you're eating a vegetarian wrap. Customer service was the worse I've ever had."}
{"text":"Best Philly cheesesteak I've had in town. Fresh and taste great. Staff was very courteous and they stay open late."}
{"text":"Discovered this place only two weeks ago and have already been several times. I honestly don't know why this place isn't busier than it is. The staff is always polite and the food is fresh."}
{"text":"Expected a great Mediterranean meal, it did not happen.  Service really slow, 45 min. due to heavy delivery order volume."}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed with their pizza. The cheese had a weird flavor to it and the sauce (when I could find the barest hint of it) was bland. The free cheesecake with Yelp check-in is store-bought. They also charge extra if you use a credit card. I really wasn't expecting a lot at just $8 for a 16-inch one topping, but even at that price, I doubt I'll get it again. It makes me sad because I was really excited to find a cheap pizza place, but I guess I'll keep looking. Cashier was friendly."}
{"text":"A very good option for a late night bite. I got the lamb gyro and it was fantastic! You can tell it was freshly made. I definitely would recommend this place to anybody that loves a local shop. Definitely coming back soon."}
{"text":"I come to tasty grill regularly and I have always had a good experience. The staff is always courteous, food is amazing, and the prices are great!"}
{"text":"Little hole in the wall restaurant that was surprisingly really good!! The food was super yummy and they didn't mind that we came in at 11 PM. Large portions which are great for sharing!"}
{"text":"Tasty grill has amazing food, great service and fast delivery though Postmates. Everything I've had from there has exceeded my expectations taste-wise! Being gluten sensitive I stay away from most bar food but in this instance I was craving a burger! I ordered from Tasty Grill and requested my burger be made bun-less and lettuce wrapped. I would be lying if I didn't say it was ingeniously wrapped! Instead of having the burger falling apart with the lettuce ripping after each bite this burger was wrapped like a burrito and cut in half!!! Now that's great customer service! I would recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"This grill is one of my fave places in the area that I've had so far. Great varied selection, and tasty ribs, stays open late, and great customer service. I was feeling lazy today so just ordered delivery for the first time, and can't wait! Beat local delivery option by far, looking forward to their crispy potato skins."}
{"text":"Get have nice deals for first time customers. Nice greasy spoon place of that's what you're looking for."}
{"text":"I really don't know how this place has four stars. We came in one night - 11:21, not too late. Place was deserted. 

The service was good. At the beginning. The food came out pretty quick - we ordered mozzarella sticks, nachos and the hummus plate. 

The mozzarella sticks were pretty good, but like everything else served, I'm really confident it was store bought. The nachos were not good - bordering on gross. The hummus plate was ok, but again, absolutely nothing special. Prices were cheap, but considering the food quality, it's not a bargain. 

After the food came, out server vanished. 

Finished eating, waitress didn't come back to give us our check for a while. We had to get up and go find her. Requested a refund on nachos, which we didn't eat after sampling the quality. She called the manager, who told us that after it was served, they couldn't refund it. 

Feel let down by Yelp about this place. Really not good."}
{"text":"Great food! I have tried the pizza, tenders, burgers and fries, all delicious. I treat my coworkers for
Lunch from time to time and I always order delivery from tasty grill. The lunch specials they offer are generous portions and very affordable."}
{"text":"Lazy Sunday evening my husband, daughter and I are hungry and after a day of non stop house chores we decided to give this place a try. Well the tasty grill did not disappoint. We ordered from here because of all the positive reviews. This place is delicious and has quite the variety of food. 


I ordered the philly, my husband the lamb gyro, and we got the sampler platter. It was so very good and the portions are HUGE. The entrees are big enough to split. 

We also were very impressed with delivery time. From ordering to our door it was about 30 min. Def would like to try the restaurant out in person"}
{"text":"Ah, the warm weather is upon us. And not feeling like cooking is a natural feeling. Yes even on a Sunday. Me and mine are empty nesters so there are times when we want something simple to eat while we watch are usual Sunday programs.  This time around we choose the Tasty Grill. My beautiful one ordered the Greek sandwich. Hearty stacked with plenty of meat, onions lettuce and all the rest of the fixings. Her only complaint was that it was mushy. I had the Philly Cheese steak and some mozzarella sticks. Average food was okay. Just bring cash because you will be charged a dollar just to use your  card. A practice that seems to be the  norm for a number of eating neighborhood establishments in Las Vegas. I can never understand why I choose to eat at your place and you want to charge me for it. Any rate  Dillion the nice guy on the register was awesome. Okay place just take cash. Food is a average."}
{"text":"Philly cheese steak is original, the price is unbeatable for the service. All my friends that visit me from LA this is our hangout place. Everyone is super nice."}
{"text":"Just don't come here. If you complain and try to leave before your food is even out, they will literally go out to your car and force you to come BACK INSIDE from driving away, and pay for food that never came to the table that you don't even want to take anymore after waiting so long. One plate came, it was cold (toasted sandwich and french fries) and left behind, full."}
{"text":"Ordered the nachos with no jalapeños. Got the order had jalapeños on so took the ones off the top and all there was hardly any meat and cheese and it was mainly tomato, lots of onion, tortilla chips. And lots of chips was just broken little pieces."}
{"text":"Happy to be greeted right as I walked in. Super friendly staff! Great food and all kinds of choices. The place itself is a very casual feel. A place to go if you have a few drinks next door, want to chat and eat a good sandwich."}
{"text":"Hmm.. maybe I ordered wrong..

Service was extremely friendly here so I hate to leave a 3star, but it's where they are at this point. 

Decor is simple, if not lacking for being in a prime location of Chandler mall, but that's neither a knock or positive. I wish they had misters like b dubs across the way but they seem new so maybe that will come.

One of the dishes was a chicken wrap that had way too much garlic, and I love garlic, so def needs to be toned down.

I'll keep this one simple since their new, they're okay. I can see them turning into something better, but I could also see it taking a turn for the worse. I wish them luck!"}
{"text":"What a hidden gem! We found a flyer on our door and finally decide to try this place out. It's connected to Putter bar but it has its own entrance. I love that that have so many different options and it's all a great price. My husband and I are definitely coming back."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! My son brought me here and said good things about this place but once I tried it, it was way more than I expected. The salad's dressing is great. I am a fan of salads and this is the best salad I've ever had! The atmosphere is so \"homey\", you walk into the place and feel at home. Also, you definitely get your money's worth. It's cheap taking into account the fact that the quality and the amount of food that you get."}
{"text":"THREE STARS because of the rude delivery service. First time ordering from them and probably gonna be the last. I saw ribs on the menu & that's what drew my attention. But when I tasted it , well it's just not my kind I guess. My husband's grandma liked it, but I did not. It was NOT fall off the bone ribs. And my husband's gma Hardly eats ribs & all I ate in Hawaii was ribs!!! Lol! Soooo I guess you can see for yourself. When the food was delivered and my husband went to grab it, he was about to reach in his pocket for the tip and TWO SECONDS after my husband had grabbed the food the delivery guy snapped saying \"next time don't say you guys are gonna tip\"!!!! NOW, first of all. We just moved here from Hawaii. So if you know anything about the \"ALOHA SPIRIT\" then you should know you will not see many people with aloha spirit ANYWHERE in the mainland. But for him to have been so rude about a tip that wasn't \"FAST ENOUGH\"?!?!! Smh. My husband was really shocked and showed him the aloha spirit by telling him to have a good day. But still, how can you expect to get tipped with a nasty attitude like that!?"}
{"text":"Great bar food; which is what I expect extra when I found this place. They also carry one of the wife's favorites which is fried zucchini which she was very happy with. I'll probably hit this place up again when I need that snack crazing satisfied."}
{"text":"Soo good curly fries were perfect not soggy at all even upon delivery, Chef salad was delicious and fully loaded!!! Even without all the meat! Customer service excellent very friendly and understanding. Delivery was also fast and prompt, they made my night!"}
{"text":"This grill is the best in town. Oscar, the owner, is extremely hospitable and makes you feel right at home when you enter the restaurant. They have the best Philly Cheesesteaks and meatball sandwiches we've had in a very long time."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! So far I've had the cheese burger, hummus plate, beef lula kabob plate, the buffalo chicken pizza, and the zeppoli. Everything was made fresh to order and tasted great. The burger was pretty solid classic cheese burger and the pizza was delicious as well. Crust was slightly crisp but soft and fresh. The Mediterranean food was pretty dang legit. Hummus was awesome and the kabob plate was fresh, amazing, and a great deal for $10. 

Pros: delicious fresh food, open pretty late, great service, and kept really clean

Cons: none that i could see after 2 visits

100% will come back!"}
