{"text":"Not sure if it's changed name, but the biggest sign on the outside says \"La Rosa\". I guess that could also it's banquet hall nickname since it does weddings, though it's the same facilities. BTW if you feel the urge to buy large quantities of [insert object] afterwards, it's across the street from a Costco.  I haven't been here for dinner in a really long time, so this is just a review for the dim sum. I like that unlike the cart system, you can just mark what you want on the order sheet (more or less accurate English translations available). Compared to other dim sum places, it is a tad more expensive, but I think the quality is also a tad better. At least they make an effort to make the dishes look good/interesting, rather than throwing everything onto the same generic flatware with the grease dribbling around the bottom. For example, they have these long shrimp roll things served in a glass, and the plain rice rolls are served in a basket-like bowl with skewers. This is also a great place for non-meat-animal-part lovers - they sell things like duck tongues, chicken knees (?!), beef tendon rolls with taro, etc.  Bonus points for changing the dishes when they get too full of bones. Also, on a weekday, you won't have too much trouble finding a table."}
{"text":"This place is closing down in another month, but I'm still going to review it!  I frequent here for dim sum quite often, and the dishes are fairly consistent. The service is also pretty good for a dim sum place - maybe because the bf's parents know most of the waiters after coming here for so many years. Most of their staff have already migrated to other Chinese restaurants due to the sale of this company.   I was here a few nights ago for dinner, and the chefs are clearly slacking already. The roasted pigeon was really dry and salty. There was one or two waiters serving the whole night. You could tell that they did not care much about their jobs any longer.   Nonetheless, I\"m still giving them four stars for what they used to be. I'm sad that they're going to be gone soon.."}
{"text":"We planned our wedding here at La Rosa last July with the help of Patrick.  HE WAS AWESOME.  We are from out of town and Patrick was extremely accomodating and helpful.  Whatever we requested - Patrick will take care of it.    We had a traditional chinese menu - food was delicious and with generous portions.  La Rosa/ Patrick are not frugal hagglers - very generous and happy with what we paid.  Great staff and service.    Our big day was exceptionally smooth and Patrick and staff were on hand and foot at all times."}
{"text":"Celestial Court is a good dim sum place in the GTA.  They have quite a few signature dishes that you don't find in too many other dim sum houses such as the double boiled brisket, and the simple yet one of our favourite all time dishes, green beans and ground pork in spicy black bean sauce.  The quality of the food is pretty darn good and we've had decent service unlike many other dim sum places.  Weekend services are usually brutal!  Celestial Court is not a cart place.  I'm torn because I've always loved the novelty of the cart, however with the ordering system we get all the food that we want at the same time.  Then again that kinda just goes against the principal of dim-sum where you're forced to slow down, wait for your dish one at a time and you get what is available.  Very zen.  The biggest reason I don't give this place a 4 star rating is that it's a bit on the expensive side (we usually average around $20 per person) and nothing here specifically wows us.  Everything is just good.  The advantage of this pricing point though is that there's never a line up, unlike other value places that Asians love.    SO if you're looking to get in and out, get good food, and not have to spend 45 minutes waiting to get in, this is the place."}
{"text":"It's amazing that Celestial Court has been around for as long it has given it's totally random location.  It's 1 block south of Highway 7 and just east of Woodbine.  It's kinda across the street from the Costco, but it's on neither major street.  It's definitely a conversation from a previous incarnation as a banquet hall.  My family eats dim sum here every Saturday.  The dim sum is solid, but nothing remarkable.  In general, the quality is strong and on the odd occasion we get something yucky which they will replace without question once notified.  They do have a pretty wide selection of dishes, but its all pretty standard.  They certainly don't strive to be creative.  I wish they would have some daily specials!  The service is fine.  Folks are generally friendly and responsive.  Most do not speak English, which shouldn't be a surprise north of Sheppard!     Decor is clean and pleasant, nothing remarkable (this ain't Crown Pricess or Casa Victoria).  There are two dining rooms with each with their own local and feel.  One is more faux-gazebo with wood-paneling and lattice (no joke!) and the other is more standard contemporary (just redone!).    As with most dim sum places in TO now, they've replaced the carts with paper ordering.  Makes for a more refined service, which I personally prefer.  Celestial Court never gets to rowdy, so definitely serves a nice place to get together for a peaceful dim sum lunch."}
{"text":"Restaurant closed for good.  Sad because I really enjoy the Sunday lunch where I don't have to wait, consistent food with good service.  Hope you reopen."}
{"text":"Regardless of this score, I recommend you go here.  So, we went here last weekend and it was mixed bag for me.    On the one hand the ingredients and food tasted fresh.  Not just hot,  but more flavourful and tender than usual.  The food (that I ate) was cooked nicely.  Tentacles and squid weren't chewy or rock hard, which is a usual barometer for me.  The irony of having the taste coming through much clearer was that I didn't always like what I was eating.  Doesn't make sense?  Hear me out.  In a lot of dim sum places the overriding flavour is grease.  At Celestial the flavours of the meat and sauces were much more present and at times over powering, especially for dishes my pallet is not quite familiar with, like duck tongues, for example. Sadly dishes I 'usually' like weren't what I was used to, and too much of the meat or spices could be tasted, and not for the best. Another issues is that the meat used was much more... rustic.  My preference is for low fat/bones/cartilage in my meat, and at celestial the meat contains plenty of that, because that's just normal - just not normal for me.   One other negative was that the chicken feet weren't cooked properly, accodring to my wife and friends eating them.   In terms of the other stuff restaurants get rated for, the service was good, the place was nice and clean and +1 marks for a menu to order from.  Yay no carts!  The price was also a little more than usual, but still not much more than $10/ person.  So I give this place three stars because while I think this is actually a great dim sum place and I'd like to return; until I can get used to some of the flavors, I just won't enjoy it as much as my usual greasy chopsticks (not spoon) dim sum places."}
{"text":"The best dim sum I have had in a long time. Locals say there is better, but I thought this was fantastic."}
