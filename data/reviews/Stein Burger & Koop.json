{"text":"This is my families new favorite place to eat.  The fries are hand cut and the ribs are top quality.  We have never had a bad meal.  On Saturdays they have a pint for $4.00  You can't go wrong at this place"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this local business/restaurant a few months ago and have been returning probably once a week ever since. Half price appetizers provide lots of choice and excellent value! The daily specials are great for the casual date night with food and drink offerings. They've got lots of TVs to catch the night's sport game and has been getting busier with each visit.. So the secret is out on this hidden gem! Go try it out yourself and support local business!!"}
{"text":"We've been to this place a few times and the food is always good and the deals are great. However we have had some issues with the specials in the past and the service is abysmal.   They have one server amd she is either too busy or inept but she is the worst waitress I have ever seen. One of orders is always late, usually by 15-20 minutes, she is hard to get a hold of in case something is wrong or we wanted to order more drinks and we usually have to start a small fire on the table to get her attention so we can finally pay and leave.   As for the specials, they were constantly changing and when we tried to get a premium beer with the special we were told that would be impossible even after we told the waitress we would pay to for the upgrade.  If they had two wait staff I think most of these problems could be avoided but this is ridiculous. If you want good food at affordable prices this is the place but be prepared to make it yourself."}
{"text":"This place is the best burger place you have never heard of.  Beefy patty, super soft buns, crispy bacon, and easy over egg all in a well proportioned burger.  The burger isn't greasy, and you don't feel sick after eating it.  I've been here three times for the burgers and they continue to impress.  I would say their burger is better than Heroes, five guys (over rated), or even Burger Priest (over rated and gimmicky).  The burgers are just fantastic with no gimmicks.  The fries are also fantastic.  They are not greasy, they're crispy, with a creamy center that is slightly sweet.  I would put them up there with McD's fries as my personal favourites.  The fries also work well in a poutine as their gravy is pretty good, but I wish the gravy was hotter so they'd do a better job of melting the cheese curds.  They also offer boozy shakes, and the Pina Colada boozy shake I had was delicious but maybe a bit light for booze.  The wings are just alright as they were a bit bland.  If you go there, I HIGHLY recommend you do yourself a favor and try a burger and fries."}
{"text":"Great food, great service and awsome management! I have no complaints what so ever. I recommend stein burger & Koop to my friends and they as well said the same thing. A friendly environment where families with children are always welcome. 5 stars all the way! Keep it up stein burger & koop!!!"}
{"text":"The place was only 2 weeks old when I went so it was fairly new. It used to be a wild wings but that closed down. They kept the whole wooden furnish so the place looks and feels nice. Parking is plenty.   The menu has a good selection of burgers and everyone should be able to find a burger they like. I personally had a burger myself and it was great. The bun and condiments were good if not above average but most importantly I liked the patty. I felt it had a good meat flavour to it.  Also to note they have the option to upgrade the fries that come with your burger to a poutine for 1.50 which I liked as I love my poutine. Their poutine was your standard poutine but it was good.  They do also have wings on the menu at standard prices and other stuff on the menu as well but I cant remember at the moment.   I highly recommend anyone to at least try the place out and get a burger."}
{"text":"Nice neighbour bar feel (where everybody knows your name LOL).  My burger was fresh and delicious. Burgers are half price on Tuesdays.  They have a great special every day of the week.  Salad was very decent for a bar and service was fast, efficient and easy on the eyes ;-)   I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is now called Yogi's Grill. It was very confusing when my buddies and I got to the plaza and couldn't find Stein Burger so we called up the number and yeah, it appears to have undergone a name change. They say the menu is the same and the restaurant is essentially the same. I couldn't tell you since it was my first time going there.  The service was mind-blowingly slow given that there were only two other occupied tables in the restaurant at that time. I have no idea what could possibly explain that lack of speed and attentiveness. The server was slow, the kitchen was slow. Everything was slow. Don't come here if you have to worry about keeping your lunch to under an hour.   The food was pretty good. Good flavours, great hand-cut fries. The burger patty was unfortunately overdone so it did suffer a bit from dryness."}
{"text":"Always have a nice time & meal here. Good selection. Good food. Nice beer selection. Friendly wait staff.  Sometimes their nachos could be heated and cooked better. After the top layers gone, things sometimes were hardly melted & warmed.  They may need to work on that a little. Otherwise no issues here at all."}
{"text":"A great local pub. I tried the the Steinburger and my son had the Texas burger. Both burgers were very solid. The server was very friendly. Bother burgers were juicy and we liked the topping choices offered at the table."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim with my friends and I did not leave disappointed! I ordered the Mexican burger  w/ fries and shared the bacon wrapped chicken wings (yup, you read that right). What made the burger unique was the fact that they buttered the bottom bun and grilled it on the flat top so that it created the perfect crunch when you bite into the burger. This in turn helps to create an illusion that the crunch actually came from the outside of the burger when in reality it was the awesome bun! The guacamole that topped the burger also tasted light and refreshing. My friends and I commented that the burgers at Stein Burger are one of those that are unhealthy, but doesn't FEEL unhealthy when you eat it. In fact I probably could have eaten a second one.  The bacon wrapped chicken wings were also different from what I expected! They were really crispy, and relatively dry! I liked this b/c I was concerned that the bacon grease would make the wing really soggy and oily but in the end it was pretty awesome.  They also have daily specials! I recommend going on Thurs for half price burgers! They also have milkshakes, which I noticed AFTER i placed my order (sigh), which are 4.99 with spiked milkshakes going for only 6.99 i believe.  Overall, will definitely return to check out the rest of their burger menu as well as other dishes like the chicken and waffles. Minor setback though, the wait for the food was fairly long despite the restaurant not being that busy. But with the quality of food I got, I think it was well worth the wait."}
{"text":"4.5 stars. Reason being slow service and food took too long.. Or maybe I was just hungry as hell lol. Service wasn't bad at all, actually it was fantastic.. They were just slow.  Food department was good too. Menu didn't have too much items, but passable for a bar. Tonight was half price appetizers (friday), so I got a large Poutine with garlic bread. Gf had the Steinburger w/ fries. The fries without the gravy wasn't anything special. But the poutine was something else - it was ginormous! Had just enough gravy and cheese curds.. Perfect for a Friday night, just before badminton lol! The gravy wasn't too salty or tasteless, it actually tasted good. Only problem I had with it was it arrived warm, not hot like how all star wings. I think it's because they wanted to bring both our orders at the same time.. So no pts deducted for that.   The burger.. What can I say? It tasted like a Harvey's burger, but the beef patty was definitely larger. Lots of condiments that go with it and it was topped with a lot of lettuce, tomatoes and pickle! The beef patty needed to be more tender, softer.. Felt like I bit into something hard.. Lol. I think it was just over cooked, but still good!  They have specials everyday, whether they're food or drinks or BOTH! If you come, make sure it's a Friday and you order a LARGE poutine! LOL"}
{"text":"Food is good but service was slow!  Wait time is a good 30 minutes with not many people in the joint. I have been twice in the last week and asked for soup both times.   I did not receive my soup until 3/4 way through my meal.  The second visit I specifically asked for my soup as an appetizer and it came at the same time as my meal."}
{"text":"Solid place to eat! Great wings, onion rings, fries and poutine. Burgers can be a little over done sometimes but are tasty.  My 2 yr old always scarfs down the grilled cheese too. I've always had good service there. They have good happy hour specials, just haven't been able to partake in those."}
{"text":"If it was not for Yelp, I would have never found this place. Based on the Yelp reviews, I gave it a try today for lunch.  The place was almost deserted which was a surprise. Apparently they are doing a major reno and are continuing to run the place during the day.   I ordered the Stein burger with fries and I opted to have them poutined.  It took a long time to get my order even though there were only a few patrons.  I was pretty disappointed with my meal.  First of all, the poutine curds were stone cold and the gravy tasted like it came from a can.  There was nothing illustrious about the fries but the portion was large enough.   As for the burger, the meat was rather dry and tasteless and was topped with something resembling a tomato, a slice of red onion and some pathetic iceberg lettuce.  The bun was pretty generic and nothing to get excited about. I ordered a soda water and was rather shocked to see that I was charged $2.99 for it.  I mean....c'mon.... this is tap water that has been carbonated by the soft drink fountain.  Their cost is probably 10 cents to produce it so although I have no complaint with the product, the price certainly left a bad taste in my mouth.   Would I go back?  Not a chance in hell.  As often said, you only get one chance to make a first impression and this one was 100 percent bad.  The Steer Inn on Yonge Street has this place beat 6 ways to Sunday."}
{"text":"The burgers are amazingly and absolutely good here even though I am not a big fan of burgers.  There are 14 different types of burgers we can choose from the menu.  This place has Shock Top on tap!  It becomes my favorite beer.  I tried the Western burgers made with smokey BBQ sauce, coleslaw, strip bacon, cheddar cheese and onion rings.  It was super  delicious!  The All-Day-Breakfast burgers came with an over-easy fried egg and crispy strip bacon were so creative and yummy.  Burgers are half price on Tuesdays!  There is different special on every single day.  This place serves variety of food and drinks.  Other than the fixed menu, there are other special combos, appetizers and pizza fully listed on a blackboard.  The Deep Fried Tuna Bites was one of those special appetizers I found.  They were made like a mini-version of crab cake for only $4.99.  Another lovely food I tried from this place.    The service will be a bit slow when the place gets busy.  However, people who work there are very friendly.   Thumbs up to the chef!  The poutine and boozy shakes will be my next try."}
{"text":"Decided to try after the good reviews.  So it was FIFA with DEN and BRA (3rd place) and the place was only 1/5 full the whole time.  Ordered the special rack of Ribs (Sat) 11.99 and 1 lb of wings (9.99).  Ribs tasted like the President's Choice (frozen) ribs.  Nothing special came with fries (which was actually good) and coleslaw.   The dusted wings (ordered spicy and 7pcs to the lb was not spicy at all and not vinegary to go with the beer.  Overall,. I would say it's okay.   Service was  meh as we had bones from wings and ribs but they never gave us bowls to put them in or napkins (had to get extra at the bar myself) as the girls were all huddled up and chatting with each other somewhere.   They do have weekly specials from Mon-Sun and I'm sure to try out their famous Steinburger but I think I'd  watch FIFA's final with GER and ARG someplace more crowded and rowdy.   thanks"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best burger joint north of Toronto.  I've been to a lot of burger joints and pubs downtown and this one is right up there with them, if not even better because I trust their ingredients.  Their burgers aren't your greasy drive-in burgers, I'd actually say they could pass as gourmet. I've had their all day breakfast burger, mexican burger, veggie burger, and stein burger and all of them have been absolutely stellar.  Their veggie burger is actually the best veggie burger I've ever had.  It does not taste like a veggie burger at all and has tons of fresh corn and beans mixed into the patty.  Their sauces on their burgers are amazing.  They all taste so fresh and home made.  I cannot believe this place doesn't have more reviews.  It's SO good!"}
{"text":"Stein Burger & Koop is a good neighbourhood pub and eatery.   Wednesday $9.99 Pint and Stein Burger sounds like my kind of place!  There are quite a few different kind of burgers to choose from and on Tuesdays they are all going for half price!   Prepare to wait a little as service can be quite slow even when the place was not busy during my visit.   There are though a few TVs if you here to catch a game or 2.   The interior though feel dark and dated.  Stein Burger ($7.99) with fries is quite a good deal even when I paid the full price!"}
