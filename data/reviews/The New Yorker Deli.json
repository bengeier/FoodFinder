{"text":"I only ever come here for breakfast but it is my absolute favorite place when you're craving a big plate with eggs, bacon, potatoes and toast.  Nothing like a warm belly to start the day off right!  I'm not sure about sandwiches and the actual \"deli\" portion of their menu, but they do breakfast well.  Plus, the service staff is friendly and keeps the coffee coming regularly."}
{"text":"If you are of Asian descent, do not eat here. The breakfast special was good, but the servers are racist. When I ordered the breakfast special, the waitress did not respond so I repeated my order in which she snapped back \"YES, I know what the breakfast special is.\" She served us with a bad attitude. Meanwhile at the table across from us sat a Caucasian family. To them she would say \"Have a great weekend!\" and cheerily served them. The food came relatively quickly and was an adequate serving size for the price.

TL;DR, If you don't mind being stigmatized for being a minority, come enjoy the food."}
{"text":"Been here twice, both times the service was slow. 

The deli sandwiches are great, but my eggs benedict had a solid yolk and was swimming in overly salty hollandaise.

Breakfast special is a good deal, but other food it hit or miss. Worth a try."}
{"text":"Ech. I'm not asking for the world from my deli sandwiches, but still. You can pile the pastrami as high as you like, but if it tastes a little too much like a salt-lick and leaves the bread disintegrating in one's hands, what's the point? I had a better Ruben in a faux-deli in the NY NY casino in Vegas, and that bothers me a tad. 

Breakfast, sad to report, not much better. It gets the job done, and if it was cheap I would forgive everything, but for $12+ I want good homefries, dammit. Greasy breakfast is better at the Coach House on Yonge, fancy brunch better plenty of other places. 

I predict I will be back here for a sandwich at some point. Sometimes you need a fist-sized stack of corned beef, and mediocre is, unfortunately, still a little better than none."}
{"text":"We came in for an early afternoon breakfast, and weren't disappointed.  Classic breakfast joint, with fast & friendly service, a bottomless cup of coffee, and great omelettes.

Kudos to Noreen, our server, for her clairvoyant abilities.  She knew instantly when I needed more coffee (how did she do that?)

Look forward to going back."}
{"text":"While I've never been here during the weekday lunch rush, the service is quick and great when I do go.  The all-day breakfast special is easily the best value at just under $5; it includes 3 eggs, home fries, potatoes.

However, as far as the smoked meat goes the prices can get quite steep.  The first time I went here I ended up paying $30 for a corned beef combo (sub greek salad) with a matzo ball soup and a canned pop.  Suffice to say, I watched what I ordered the next visit.  I've only tried the corned beef and pastrami in the deli meat section and the corned beef easily takes the proverbial cake.  The karnatzel is a great quick eat that you can just grab from the counter and the staff is friendly and competent.  Overall, a solid meal if you're looking for some quick deli fare."}
{"text":"By far the worst deli I've been to in Toronto. The decor is nice, but that's about it. I ordered 1lb of pastrami only to have to spend time at home cutting off the fat that made up for half of every piece. Total rip off and parking is a pain to find. Clearly, they don't have a clue as to how to serve the meat properly. There was also what looked like a pig ear just laying around on the cutting table. Very unprofessional. As for the pastrami itself, it was sub-par at best."}
{"text":"This is more of a 2.5/5. Came here for a quick breakfast stop. Let me tell you the service here is slow. It took 15 minutes for them to come to our table. The staff are not friendly. The only ok thing about this place is the food. It was just OK. I definitely wont be returning."}
{"text":"The New Yorker is our go-to neighbourhood breakfast spot.  The food is always good as well as the service.

The latkes are good but greasy as mentioned.  My personal favourite is the corned beef has and eggs.  The french toast is great as well and comes in a huge portion in the form of a whole 1/4 loaf of bread.

The lunch foods are great as well.  This is a good place to get a big sandwich or a greasy burger."}
{"text":"It's great if you don't want to take the time to go somewhere else.  Basically, I'm saying that it's serviceable.  I eat here semi-regularly, so don't get me wrong -- I like it, I just like some other smoked meat places more."}
{"text":"How hard is it to serve a good burger? The New Yorker Deli proved that a burger as big challenge for them. Cold bums (with some burned garlic slices on the top!) and bad tasting hamburger (was that really ground beef?) equals to a burger fail. I'm definitely not coming I back."}
{"text":"On a whim, I thought I'd give this place one final try after being disappointed on several occasions before. Bad move. 

Once again, this place proved to be the opposite of what a New York or Montreal deli should be. Overpriced. Cold. Lack lustre. The elements of a deli are there, but the effort is not. 

To really get a feel for what I'm saying, look no further than the smoked meat combo. A deli staple. And one that I've enjoyed in Delis many, many times. This sandwich is all about excess and spectacle. You're supposed to receive it, observe how ridiculously thick and high the meat is piled, and question your sanity for ordering this pastrami sky scraper. Cut to New York deli and a disgruntled-looking man weighing your meat on a scale before making your sandwich. 

And you get it all, with a drink, no pickle, soggy fries and a thimble-sized container of \"cole slaw\" for $17.00!!!! Not to mention service with a scowl. 

For those who call this a deli, I can only wonder if this, in fact, is the only deli you've ever been to?"}
{"text":"The New Yorker Deli is a good example of a common theme amongst my peoples.  It's one of those restaurants that they've never eaten at, but know where it is, and have always wondered.  I think wondering is over-rated, I prefer to go in and chowdown.  That's exactly what happened several years ago.  I admit, I had passed by it a few dozen times, but usually after having eaten or on my way to eat elsewhere.  But since my first meal, it has consistenly served great food at a good price, and all under an hour.  All that may explain why it's a popular lunch run for many officeheads, including myself. It's usually one of the first places I recommend when planning a lunch date, like today.  My dear friend Bana recently went back to work and we met up for a long overdue chittychat.  She was one of the first friends I ever made in Toronto and is one of the inspirations for my starting this blog.  She's supportive like that.



NY Deli has a huge menu which is ideal if you're eating with a bunch of colleagues.  In fact, I recommend this place to anyone who wants a quick, delicious lunch, especially if they're not sure what they want.  There is a wide selection of deli sandwiches (duh), breakfast options and regular lunch fare.  My boss loves their matzo ball soup.  I love their corned beef hash and eggs.


It's a working lunch done right."}
{"text":"We had a great lunch here today! If you're thinking of the corned beef sandwich, I recommend you go with the latkes on the side - they were pretty good - and the grilled chicken Caesar salad was fresh and well-proportioned without going crazy on the dressing. As a bonus, our server was very friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"This place probably good for one thing nostalgia. I had heard about the french toast being good here so had it bookmarked for a while. Sadly this was a greasy mess (which might be something some people crave). The menu is extensive and I might come back again to try the savory offerings.
The french toast we tried though a good sized portion is deep fried and is devoid of the eggy taste one craves. The side of prepackaged sugary syrup instead of real maple syrup  (this is Canada folks and I thought we are known for this) didn't help either. 
2 stars."}
{"text":"I came here last weekend for a deli breakfast and I had very low expectations based on many of the Yelp reviews I read and visiting this place in the distant past. 

My girlfriend got the corned beef with latkes and I got the pastrami with a knish. The portions of the sandwich were okay ( not huge) but the knish was quite large and came with beef gravy. Good variety of mustards on the table to add some umph to the meat. 

Prices were comparable to Capalanskys (maybe a dollar cheaper for the combo). Service was a bit unfriendly but fairly quick."}
{"text":"omg this place needs to be shut down immediately how did they ever get a green pass is beyond me. I went in there not knowing what to order and they kept recommending the Rueben sandwich. I ordered it and instead of fries and coleslaw he said take the potato pancake and pickle . for a 13.50 sandwich combo I think a pickle shouldn't be considered a side order. should  come automatically with any smoked meat sandwich at a high quality deli restaurant. just cornbeef or pastrami sandwich is 8.50 now they have soup and sandwich combo for 13.50 now soup on its own is 4.95 so how is that a deal its same price. I asked for a bowl of soup and the woman like you cant have the combo u ordered a ruben not just plain cornbeef sandwich . I said that's fine knowing full well its not a deal anyways I said just want bowl of soup and they treated me like I was racking up the bill and immediately threw the bill at me soon as my food came . I said I didn't ask for the bill I think the customer should ask for the bill or the waiter should ask you want anything else and should wait for customer to be almost finished before u hand over the bill. she replied fine you don't want the bill don't have the bill and snatched it off the table . I said what if I wanted order something else like dessert or a coffee or beer after then have to pay twice doesn't make sense. when I did order a beer after she brought me two separate bills after took for ever to do so. I didn't even leave a tip I said this is crazy I don't ask for bill you bring it right away and when I do you take forever. the place was empty and service is so slow they had microwave my sandwich to make it seem like it was fresh and hot yet was still cold cause how long u think heating for 10 seconds is gonna last. there was a fat black man maybe 350 pounds making all sandwiches and salads using his bare hands no gloves or even washing his hands once not even once in about an hour I was there. the woman said whats wrong I said just a little disappointed he not wearing gloves or washing his hands and she replyed well if you call the health inspectors they will even tell you wearing gloves is more dangerous then not wearing gloves. I said he not washing his hands just that towel over and over again she said whats the problem he just preparing food that's all he doing not like he on his cell phone . I am almost 40 never seen a cook or chef prepare dish after dish for that long not washing his hands not once. I will never come back because she was denying he vwas doing anything wrong but deep down I know she knows he was cause why would she get so defensive right off the bat claiming about me calling the health board. 27 dollars for a dinky pastrami sandwich 1 pickle 2 of those so called hockey puck looking pancakes which to me was just batter filler and a 4 ounce bowl of soup that was so fuckin bland all the pepper in world wouldn't of jazzed it up enough like one guy on hear said tasted like tap water with one chicken boullion cube in it with odd noddle and 1 beer that's high way robbery like I said no tip I think I payed more then enough already. beer should been 4.50 not 7 its not a bar we at the sandwich should been 6 or 7 not 13 soup sould been 3 or 4 this place sucks not once asked hows the food or said hello or goodbye. if you don't like dealing with people then don't work in that kind of environment I think more people do cause they get tips cash daily they in it for the money not cause they enjoy helping others or contributing to society. they in it for wrong reasons which gives some places bad rebutations. food is food but good service is hard to find. I guess I will keep searching."}
{"text":"I come for the matzoh ball soup. Yummy. Where else are you gonna get that in this neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"I'm always at a loss for inexpensive places to eat in the Yorkville area. While there seem to be lots and lots of restaurants, I never have any idea of which ones are worthy of my high-falutin' taste buds. I am so happy my friend suggested we go to The New Yorker Deli before we saw 'I Am Love' across the street (my Reuben sandwich turned out to be better than the movie, BTW).

At first glance, this deli really looks like it could be a genuine New York haunt, replete with tile floors and retro booths and tables. Our waitress was reminiscent of a New Yorker as well, with a dose of good ol' Toronto hospitality thrown in for good measure. She took lots of time to help us navigate our way through the huge menu and explain several dishes. Lovely woman, a spitfire really.

I ended up going with the Rueben combo (+fries and coleslaw), as previously mentioned. And it was DEE-lish--salty meat, tangy sauerkraut and a big side of homemade thousand islands dressing! My total was about $15, and it was worth every penny (although I wouldn't exactly complain if it was lower). I'm relatively new to the world of smoked meats, but I'd have to say this place lived up to my expectation of what a prime example should taste like. I'm looking forward to trying other combos!!

My friend ordered a breakfast sandwich with egg, cheese and peameal bacon that was so big I couldn't believe he finished it... must have been really good. Cause it truly was epic.

All in all, this was a great experience. Partly because the food was great, but also because I'm glad I now know it exists."}
{"text":"A decent place for a corned beef sandwich or some other New York staple, but I'm never blown away when I go. 

Just a little something always seems to be missing. 

I frequent about once every couple of months."}
{"text":"Their sandwiches are ok at best and the portions are pretty mediocre for the price you pay.  If you have a hankering for deli in downtown then go for it...it's better than Druxy, but there are definitely better ones in town"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch on a Sunday.  From the looks of it, it looks like your typical deli type style shop.  IMO, deli's should have amazing corned beef.    Did they???? 

Pros: 
-Clean
-They had 4 different types of mustard - hot & spicy, sweet & spicy, honey mustard and regular.  
-Not too expensive at $7.99 a sandwich (I ordered a corned beef)

Cons:
-Sandwich wasn't massive.  I was kind of expecting it to be massive considering sandwiches should be their specialty.
-There was absolutely no toppings such as lettuce, tomatoes, pickles (it came on the side), etc.  
-The bread tasted very average.  I actually found the bread a bit hard.  It wasn't stale, but it just wasn't super soft or anything.  

Verdict: May visit again, but nothing spectacular.  New Yorker Deli is misleading as this definitely did not feel like a sandwich from the Bronx. Oh yeah, and no, they didn't have an amazing corned beef sandwich."}
{"text":"3.5 this place hits the spot when it comes to breakfast places.  simple and easy diner vibe.  its not extravagant but ita great for that quick easy breakfast.  service is decent as well."}
{"text":"This cute deli shop located in Yorkville is definitely the kind of relaxed, laid back, Sunday pick me up we all need in our lives. Came here twice - for breakfast and for lunch. My boyfriend picked out this place - he lives in Yorkville and walks by it every morning on the way to work. Shoutout to him for the recommendation!

They have a breakfast special for $5.50, but it is nothing special - just a combination of eggs, baked potatoes, toast, and bacon. Lunch however, is a completely different story. I cannot stress this enough but they HAVE THE BEST PULLED PORK SANDWICH IN TOWN. I have not have a lot of pulled pork sandwiches in my life but this was definitely my best one (and this place will be hard to replace). 

Their coffees are terrible though, but the upside is that it is unlimited refills. 
The servers give it a homey feeling, it seems like a family owned business. 
This deli can get busy during lunch hours but definitely worth the wait. 
A little overpriced, but if you go for the pulled pork sandwich (with coleslaw) on the side, you can definitely do no wrong."}
{"text":"I eat here quite a bit even though it's not the greatest. What can I say? I'm a masochist, and this place is close to my apartment. Here, you'll get your bacon and eggs with a side of indifference, and you'll like it, goddammit. The service can be a little hit or miss, and some servers are better than others (though none are particularly enthusiastic). You may not get your ass kissed, but at least you'll get your food fairly speedily.

The sandwiches, while a far cry from Katz's in Manhattan (my personal favorite), are decent.  The corned beef is sliced just right, with a good ratio of fat to meat. And you can't really beat the $4.99 breakfast special. And I prefer the matzoh ball (well, it's more like a trapezoid) soup here over Caplansky's. 

This place ain't bad, but it might fit the billl 'till your next trip to Manhattan."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with my pastrami sandwich.  The meat was more salty than spiced, and as for my latkes, they were greasy and not all that tasty.  Plus, the applesauce does indeed come in a packet.  The pickle was okay, but nothing special.

One redeeming feature is the variety of mustards available on the table.  I don't think this place is really worth going to, but they do have a great location.  However, for my pastrami fix, I'd never come back here again.  I'd rather go to Shopsy's over down in the Eaton Centre or Mel's on Bloor."}
{"text":"Toronto is not New York and it never will be. There is a limited amount of good pizza and bagels, taxis can take forever, and people on the subway are not scary.* Despite being located in Toronto, The New Yorker Deli is still pretty good.

I am actually surprised I hadn't reviewed this place yet, as I have some work friends who like it so much, we go on a semi-regular basis. As a repeat customer, I have tried a variety of lunch options, including the smoked meat sandwich (mmmm), bagels with various toppings, BLTs, and salads. I have liked all of it, with one exception. Don't get the chicken salad unless you want something that I don't think IS legitimate chicken salad. Their chicken salad has egg in it. At this deli, when you ask the question, \"what came first: the chicken or the egg?\" they answer \"who cares? we'll combine them!\" In my opinion, it doesn't work, and it's nasty. When I did order it once, they were very kind and took it back with no charge, but I was still unsettled. Gross chicken salad. 

Service is pretty good. It gets busy at lunch, and sometimes you'll wait for a table, but they turn-over pretty quickly. When you get a deli sandwich, there's a variety of mustards on the table to dress it.**

*They may be stupid, but not scary
**although not the most high-end mustards in the world, more like Webers and Guldens."}
{"text":"Skip the fries and get the latkas, they're a bit greasy but soo delicous. Especially with their vinegary coleslaw, my favourite kind. Their fries are also good in a nostalgic cafeteria fries kinda way.

The service in this place isn't always the greatest so I often opt for take away and just eat in the near by lawns of UofT or bring it home but they do offer some good food at decent prices but I do like that they offer a wide selection of mustards on the table when you dine in. 

It's a nice place with good food, but clearly a deli and not looking to be more."}
{"text":"I'm a little sad to see some of these negative reviews since this is my go-to place for brunch! Of course, I've only ever ordered two things on their menu, but they're so delicious that I never feel like venturing out and trying something different.

First off, I need to mention the AMAZING french toast. I don't normally have a sweet tooth, but they make THE most phenomenal french toast I have ever had. They are so so SOOO light and fluffy! The boyfriend and I always make sure to get at least a half order, which comes with two pieces of toast, perfect for sharing.

Next is the Eggs Benedict. I almost always order eggs benedict when I'm going out for brunch and while they don't make THE BEST I have ever had, it comes pretty damn close. Simple and no fuss, with perfectly poached eggs every time, I have nothing to complain. Once, they forgot to add the peameal bacon, but when we mentioned it to the waitress, she was so shocked and apologetic and immediately brought out a fresh plate. The home fries that come on the side are also delicious with very generous portions.

For drinks, I always grab a coffee, which comes with free refills. Nothing special, but helps with the caffeine addiction. The boyfriend LOVES their fresh squeezed orange juice and I also enjoy stealing a few sips.

This is a great little deli, that feels like a family-run business (I'm not sure if this is true. I have never asked). We come usually on the weekends around lunch time and while busy, it is never full, so we're always seated right away. The wait staff are very friendly, sometimes a little harried looking when it's busy, but always polite. I will always be coming back here."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a co-worker today since we've both never been here.
The NY Deli is a popular place for breakfast and lunch. It's known for its variation of deli cuts like pastrami smoked meat to corned beef to name a few.
Their selections are great and they have their usual special combos that are popular among its patrons whether here for breakfast or lunch. (not sure about dinner)
Interior is spacious with plenty of seating and not to mention the artist mural of New York City on the backdrop/ wall reminds you where you're eating lol.  
I decided to try their Pastrami combo $14.50 which comes with pickles, slaw and potato looking hash brown/ patties.  
Portion-wise its worth it and the amount of pastrami in the sandwich is overflowing like pastrami-galore. poor bread was falling apart lol. 
Overall this place is a solid 4/5."}
{"text":"Been here many times over the past ten years - great food !!! Best french toast, great breakfast, yummy cut meat sandwiches. Delicious lox - egg, etc."}
{"text":"Went this morning to have breakfast....the servers didnt even acknowledge us...we sat at a table and the waiters kept passing by us as if we were ghosts. There was an old waitress who acted as if she was 20, and two caucasian waiters whose careers as actors never took off and it seemed they were blaming us for it. I took some pics before leaving and the rude waiters can be seen in it."}
{"text":"Decidedly adequate smoked meat. Piled reasonably high but sure doesn't compare to Montreal and Dunn's Toronto is still better. Price was $12 for the combo. The choice between pickle and slaw had me perplexed. Come on. How much is a pickle? The fries weren't Schwartz's quality. You do get a choice between home fries, fries, and potato latkes. I'd probably go for the latkes if I went back. 

Business was brisk this Sunday morning, however, which might say something."}
{"text":"In my opinion the best for deli in the city. Compares to the great deli to be had in Montreal. Nothing wrong with the service; prompt, efficient and cordial. I recommend the brisket burger (bring an appetite, its HUGE) and the Ruben Sandwich."}
{"text":"First Review (be gentle)

A little sad that my first review isn't in my hometown (Windsor), but Toronto is like my home away from home. The New York Deli is a great little deli off Bay street. Deceptively small from the outside, seating goes far back into the store so there is plenty of room to sit down and eat. The wait staff is pretty casual, so to the point that I was confused if I had to go up and place an order or wait. Regardless, within 5 mins we were waited upon and presented menus.

First off, this place serves all-day breakfast so thats a plus in my books. Omelettes, hash browns and bacon, a meal fit for any time of the day. Beyond the all-day breakfast is a plentiful deli sandwich menu, with the pastrami and beef brisket sliced right behind the deli counter. The man working that counter is a mathematician, slicing and weighing out portions for the perfect sandwich every time. Being an italian my love for cured meats knows no bound so I got the pastrami sandwich with coleslaw on the side. 

The sandwich comes plain but you can ask for a variety of toppings (the waiter thought I was asking for coleslaw on my sandwich instead of on the side), and the table has ever type of mustard known to man, even a wasabi mustard I had never seen before. 

If you're looking for a quick bite or a meal, The New York Deli can serve your needs. I want this review to be more of a validation for the power of Yelp, as looking for lunch places near my hotel this popped up and the reviews did not disappoint. 

One last tip: avoid the fries, there nothing special, get a different side dish, like the onion rings or coleslaw."}
{"text":"I have tried the eggs benedict and my wife had the steak with fries. They were all really good. I found a bit pricey though. The place is clean but the employees seem not to worry so much about the customers. Overall, it is a good place and I would come back again."}
{"text":"I came here looking for a late breakfast. They have a $5.99 breakfast special and so I ordered two eggs. toast, and makes sure you order the corned beef hash! Don't expect your typical hash for this - I think that what they use is the super-tasty guts from the inside of a kishka! Perfect about of spice and flavour! Looks like a hockey puck but is seriously good. Service was good as well. What I really liked about this place was the fact that it is accessible. Great wide aisles and hallway, leading to another wide hallway with a truly accessible washroom. Bravo! We need more of these in our city!"}
{"text":"this is a small breakfast joint which is quick, delicious and has pretty much everything you want in a breakfast and lunch diner.

i particularly like the use of corned beef incorporated into the omelets and eggs in their breakfast menu. 

good place. will definitely be coming back for breakfast next time."}
{"text":"Good, old fashioned deli right of Bloor on Bay that has a big, full menu! Can't wait to go try more!"}
{"text":"I usually get the breakfast special from here which is actually a great deal. $5.99 for two eggs, bacon, toast, and home fries. Not really any complaints other than the fact that the scrambled eggs can be a bit greasy sometimes but if you got over easy or over medium they are good. I"}
{"text":"I don't even want to give this place one star! Horrendous and lengthy service. The depressing and sad faced waitress( who clearly knows nothing about customer service) brought each breakfast item out individually and at different times rather than putting it all on one plate. To make matters worse, I waited 25 minutes for this and everything she brought was wrong. To top off my morning breakfast experience,  I was forced to listen to her father (the owner) shouting at her repeatedly for screwing up. Do NOT waste your money on this place."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast this am. Cute little cafe with very NYC decor. Ordered bacon and eggs with coffee and toast. It also cane with hash brown patties. Classic of course. The bacon, which I asked be crispy, was very thin and very well done as where hash B's. Toast ok but also thinly sliced. Coffee basic. Breakfast 20 bucks. Not really worth that. Perhaps I go again. But in no hurry"}
{"text":"Ive always seen this place when walking along bay street and the other day I decided to go in and give it a try after I noticed the breakfast special. 

The breakfast special has eggs,toast, breakfast potatoes and your choice of bacon,ham or sausage. I had the bacon.

The Resturant was clean and the person who greeted me was friendly both times I've been here its been the same worker and hes never been rude to me.

The food is great! The home fries are awesome theyre seasoned perfectly! I recommend  those also the eggs which i ordered scrambled were cooked well and tasted as if they had been seasoned well. The toast seems to be good quality it's definitely not wonder bread.

Overall, this place is great and I recommend it to anyone looking for a good breakfast deal in the downtown core."}
{"text":"I've only ever been here for breakfast - and now that I've moved to the neighborhood, I seem to never think of this place for some reason....but I think I'm going to have to change that.

This place serves probably THE BEST beef knish I've ever had!  I never used to think of a knish as a breakfast food (I've always had it as an appetizer to a dinner) but an ex-boyfriend of mine turned me on to it and I've seen the light.  The New Yorker Deli serves their knish with the gravy on the side, it keep it nice and crispy:)  Their gravy is very yummy and really makes the knish sing.

Their twister bagels are the size of my face and are very fresh.  They don't give you enough cream cheese though, so you will have to order more to cover both sides.

The place fills up pretty quickly as it's not that big, so get there early.  They aren't open that late either, so just make sure you hit it before 4pm.

It's a great place to start your day of shopping in yorkville and and beyond.  It's a little piece of New York in Toronto."}
{"text":"I've got several problems with this place.

I swung by looking for a bite to eat and decided to give it a try. It was too early for deli for me so I grabbed a bagel with egg salad on it. It was $7. I figured that if it were $7 then it should be the best bagel I've had in my life....It wasn't.

I also found this place lacked a menu for people ordering take out. So I just kind of was standing there trying to find something to eat and had to wait for a waiter to give me their menu. For a place that is trying to mimic New York (or at least I'm assuming they are based on their name alone), there should be something (or at least a condensed menu) for someone on the go or who works in the area.

Maybe their deli is better, so I'll try them again in the future but this definitely wasn't a good impression."}
{"text":"So you've spent the day shopping on Bloor, hitting all the hot spots like Harry Rosen, Holts, Tiffany's, and Prada.  Your looking for a little pick me up to get you through the next leg of your day which is shoe shopping of course, you need to go here.  The best little sandwich that side of the country imo.  Smoked meat pilled as high as one could get it without being obscene.  Paired with a Knish and a pickle... your good to go.  Reasonably priced and fast and friendly service.  My boss introduced me to this place and when she travels to Toronto for business she has a ritual of stopping here for one of their excellent sandwiches."}
{"text":"The New Yorker is a decent breakfast and lunch spot in the Bay & Bloor area. The food's a bit overpriced and fairly average but it gets the job done, especially since there are so few good places to eat in the area.

The Eggs Benedict ($10.99) gets you two poached eggs on a toasted English muffin with Hollandaise sauce. The sauce wasn't a particularly accurate version of Hollandaise but it was good nonetheless. It comes with back bacon as well though, I asked them to leave that off due to pseudo-vegetarianism. All around pretty good.

The home fries that come with the Eggs Benny were the biggest weak spot. They tasted and looked like they came out of a bag."}
{"text":"Went in on a whim one day when I was craving poutine. They didn't have it on the menu but they did make it. It was a'ight but I woudn't get it again. Obviously this place is meant for sandwiches."}
{"text":"I write this in the middle of a Yelp review jag, in advance of a trip to the real Big Apple. 

The New Yorker Deli has been around forever in Toronto terms. It opened in the dying days of the last millennium, the pet project of a refugee from the Pickle Barrel. In some respects, the menu hearkens back to the days when the Pickle Barrel was an honest-to-goodness Deli; before Rose Reisman decided that \"deli classics' meant edamame this and portobello that. The woman is a menace to society. 

As its name suggest, the New Yorker's menu hews close to deli staples. Chicken soup arrives with noodles, chicken kreplach, giant matzo ball or some combination of all three. The broth shows evidence of chicken-contact, although it is likely fortified with lotsa salt and possible a boullion cube. Kreplach filling tastes light despite a heavy wrapper. The matzo ball is more mush than dumpling, but it's just what the doctor ordered if you've got a head cold. 

Sandwiches are decidedly second-tier deli, sourced from third-party suppliers. They lose point for freshness, but hand-sliced and served lean-to-medium they fill a hole in the bay street dining scene. silverstein's rye bread redeems when fresh, and proper brown speckled deli mustard helps along side properly vinegared, not-too-sweet cole slaw. A pack of party sandwiches to go may be expensive for what you get at $6, but sometimes you just want cute crustless sammies accompanied by chips and chocolate milk. Don't judge me. Salads are fresh, but if you order a salad at a deli as your meal, you're no friend of mine. 

Diners expecting a true New York deli experience will be disappointed. There are no barrels of complimentary full and half sour pickles, and the fancy soda pops are Boylans rather than Dr. Browns.

While the food has its highs and lows, they're secondary to servers who remember me from my regular visits for greasy breakfast specials and challenges to the \"bottomless coffee\" policy. Seriously; I'm a caffeine addict now, but would have been a candidate for an intervention way back when. The $2.99 breakfast special I ordered back then is now closer to 5 bucks; the eggs are still better over-easy than scrambled (they vary from properly creamy to overcooked strips of rubber), the sausage and bacon both mahogany crisp (especially when ordered \"burnt to hell\". Rye toast and bagels are the best toasted options, slathered with salted butter. Home fries are salty crispy cubes of prefab goodness. Portions vary from skimpy to substantial depending on who's manning the stove. Coffee is adequate, but really more about quantity than quality. 

Even better, there's NYC prints on the walls and a mural that stretches along the back wall of the joint. In this faux New York, the World Trade Centre still stands. If only it were still thus."}
{"text":"shittiest food ... came by when I was on my lunch break, and discovered torontos worst restaurant ever. I was surprised chicken pot pie was on the menu... they microwaved my pie (I can see them make it ) and for some reason they poured gravy on top of my pot pie...

the chicken noodle soup ...  is suppose to come with chicken is it not? well not in this case. not a single chicken piece was in my \"soup\" that tasted very close to tap water. the waiter was like \"oh you wanted chicken in it? sometimes they ask\" well no shit. chicken noodle soup is SUPPOSE to have it...."}
{"text":"Smoked meat/pastrami/brisket sandwiches are very good.  Knish is extra tasty.  Pickles are excellent.  

For a city that lacks in delis, this spot is a breath of fresh air, especially in the downtown core.  

Oy vey!  I hope all this fat doesn't go straight to my tuches."}
{"text":"What to say, what to say? I went here when I was a sleep-starved, movie-screen blinded Film Festival employee, dragged there bleary-eyed and starving by a friend after finishing my 6 am shift. It was across the street from where I worked, so that was pretty much enough for me. 

The name. Why must they call it by that name? If they hadn't, I could have just enjoyed my sandwich for what it was (a pretty alright little sandwich, with no pressure on it to be anything else), instead of being lured in by a claim that could never be substantiated. Not that I was (lured).

It is the very incorrect impression they have of themselves as being comparable to authentic NY Deli meat that leaves me unable to give them a 3. The candour with which my sister asked \"is this anything like  New York City, *really*?\" was inappropriate but matched with equal sassiness by the waitress who assured us with confidence that we wouldn't be disappointed. Well, we would have, had we believed her.
The applesauce even came in a packet, as though it were McDonald's barbecue sauce. Seriously?"}
{"text":"The New Yorker was my go-to for a cheap breakfast way back in University. Not a lot has changed, despite a recent renovation. I was here for breakfast on the weekend. The New Yorker is still pumping out above-average breakfast standards. Large bacon and egg combos come with toast, and make sure to get the home fries. Meats are roasted in house and sliced thin at the front counter, not brought in pre-packaged.

For the first time, I got the French Toast for the kids. It might not be for everyone, but it was incredible. Thick slices of toast are dipped and deep-fried, so there's a crisp outer coating. Almost verging on donut territory. Definitely will order next time."}
{"text":"What came first?  Chicken soup or the Matzo ball?

Steps from the centre of the known universe, (Yonge & Bloor), this is THE deli to go to. This ain't no Druxys'.

Great homemade soups, wonderful selection of meats cut to order and a wide selection of traditional side dishes.  

One suggestion: skip the french fries and order a side of latke instead. 

Service is fast and friendly and the price is very reasonable."}
{"text":"The New Yorker is a cute place with great potential. I would really give this place a 2.5. 

My friend ordered the French Toast - which was great! I ordered the Lox + Cream Cheese wrap, I didn't enjoy it but it was tolerable. 

The service we experienced was quite awkward. We informed the waiter that we were waiting for a 3rd person. My friend eventually came and the waiter came almost instantly and expected us to order our food. The 3 of us had questions marks above our heads, but we quickly moved on from that. 

At the end of the meal, the waiter just tossed our cheques in front me and stood there until we noticed he was waiting (we were in the middle of a conversation). I then noticed that my cheque was incorrect and when I mentioned that the price seemed off, he simply stated that all of the wraps were the same price. As we were leaving the store, I quickly checked the menu, and I was given the wrong price. Might just be an honest mistake, but with all the other little moments- it just validated the other reviews on Yelp regarding the poor service here. 

2.5/5 because I would still like to come back to have the french toast, great location and we were warmly greeted when we entered the store."}
{"text":"Had to stop in for a quick take out wrap. Liked the selection on the menu, and thought of doing something more traditional deli but settled for a turkey wrap.

Wasn't disappointed...big chunks of roast turkey with mayo and Swiss cheese made for a very filling wrap.

As a bonus, I happened to see a local celebrity ... none other than the \"Cash Man\" ...jeweller Russell Oliver...who had stopped in for a bite from his nearby store.

On the downside, I was in a bit of a time crunch but there was confusion by the staff as to who was actually serving take out customers and the wrap took longer than I thought was necessary. 

The place is small and cozy which can be good or can be bad depending on what you like and how busy it gets."}
{"text":"Great chicken soup in the jar. Matzah balls are just the right size. Also great brisket sandwiches. Very convenient and great staff. Soup if sick is just what the doctor ordered!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Vernors ginger ale, tables full of mustard, and matzo ball soup. Three important ingredients in a great deli, and The New Yorker Deli has 'em all. 

The atmosphere is pretty sterile, with some pseudo-celebrity headshots on the wall. This won't impress most folks, but it really makes me incredibly cozy and happy. The old dudes serving up the corned beef sandwiches, pickles and other treats are great fellas, and I've never been disappointed. I'm especially in love with their matzo ball soup, complete with carrot hunks and extra salty broth. Slurp!"}
{"text":"Boom and there goes the dynamite.
 
Owner is very friendly sitting up front and volunteering all sorts of information. Printing mistake 10 years ago is still on the menu. I had to try it. Surprisingly delicious. I recommended it to my office mates.

Smoked turkey, chopped liver and corned beef for $10.99 with fries and dill or slaw. 

Quick to go sandwiches too
Dine in for about 30

Pop in, grab a bag and enjoy. This is the real stuff."}
