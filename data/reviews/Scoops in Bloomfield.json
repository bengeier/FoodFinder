{"text":"So good and so perfect on a hot day. Service was great, even gave both me and my daughter kid sized scoops."}
{"text":"triple scoop of chocolate chip cookie dough on a waffle cone, this place is one of the few that'll make me break -- no shatter my diet and exercise regimen. good ice cream, large selection, affordable prices"}
{"text":"Nice array of flavors with all the bases covered- they've got both frozen yogurt and ice cream, and all the fruity, chocolate-y, and  all the things in between covered. Really generous scoop size here!"}
{"text":"Great little ice cream place. Tons of flavors (spumoni, pumpkin, coffee, to name a few) to choose from. Also available are ice cream sodas and floats, milk shakes, and sundaes (with your choice of toppings - hot fudge sauce, strawberry topping, hot caramel, chocolate syrup, pineapples and crushed peanuts - and your choice of any ice cream). My husband and I split the brownie a la mode sundae with 2 scoops of spumoni ice cream, and hot fudge sauce and strawberry topping. It was really good, and more than enough to split between the two of us. They have a little table outside with 2 chairs and a couple of barstools and a bench inside. The store was bright, and clean. They do accept credit cards (even on our $4.95 bill), just not AMEX. We'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"One of those local places to get excellent ice cream, which I love. They weren't re-inventing the wheel, just great ice cream and good service. I am giving them a 4 instead of a 3 because they have so much variety and were affordable."}
{"text":"Nothing spectacular but not a disappointment. 1 worker during a 9pm rush. He was friendly and running around like crazy filling orders. 

No seating to hang out besides 3 stools (I think). Fairly overpriced for being Hershey and perry's brand ice cream. Sundae was 2 small scoops, tiny bit of fudge, and crushed oreos for $4.50. 

Compared to Pages Dairy Mart or Antney's this place would be a 2 star, but if you're looking for something sweet and don't mind paying a little too much for what you get, it's not too bad. Out of convenience, I'm sure I'll be back. New to this side of the city but see no competition for me to go elsewhere.

As for their website; very confusing. Menu is all jumbled with all their locations mixed within. The sundae I wanted, wasn't even listed inside the Bloomfield location so I got something else. Could definitely organize and separate the locations menus."}
{"text":"The ice cream tasted fine, but... 
We came into the shop at 5 minutes till 10 (they close at 10) and the girls working kept looking at the clock. Our sons tried quickly to choose our flavors but overall it was an uncomfortable experience."}
{"text":"Bloomfield has restaurants-a-plenty, but until recently, only had a fro-yo place available to soothe an ailing sweet tooth.  Now we have Scoops!  They have a really wide selection of flavors, from the darkest, richest fudge to the lightest sherbet, and many in between!  They're clean and have a small indoor counter space and a handy table outside too.  Price is on par for portion, and the waffle cones smell heavenly if you catch them making them fresh!  

All in all, a welcomed addition to the neighborhood and worth the walk up liberty!"}
{"text":"For the first few months of my arrival to Pittsburgh I decided to try a different ice cream shop as a Sunday treat until I discovered Scoops and since then I haven't been able to go elsewhere.  This ice cream is by far the best I've had in Pittsburgh.  Each ice cream  has chunky, flavorful bits, well distributed throughout, making every bite delectable.  I'm a huge ice cream fiend and went to the Ben and Jerry's factory in Vermont one year to tour their store.  Interesting story that one of the co founders (either Ben or Jerry) had a diminished sense of taste and was unable to fully appreciate the flavor of ice cream they were making, and so he asked for bigger chunks.  Scoops is one of the few places that really put this idea into practice.  I highly recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"We went in to get our kids ice cream after school. Ordered 2 kids size and 2 adult size (1-scoop) for $10. Basically both were the same size. Very stingy portions and way overpriced for what is, basic ice cream (it's Hershey brand). 

Basically overpriced and stingy portions for \"meh\" level ice cream."}
{"text":"The best ice cream I've ever had! 
Too many flavors and crispy vanilla waffle cone.
Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"A nice modern place set within the heart of Bloomfield. Very clean, a variety of toppings offerings, and nice staff. Stop in here sometime soon before the weather gets too cold!"}
{"text":"Stopped here on 7/31/2014. The owner waited on my husband and I. The service was great and the ice cream was even better. I will be returning very soon to try the banana cream pie flavor. Great hours too."}
{"text":"All the flavors you want in a classic scoop shop. I got the pumpkin ice cream. It's to die for!"}
{"text":"Go for Moosetracks and Gold Medal Ribbon."}
{"text":"People at this ice cream shop are super nice and friendly. They have many kinds of ice cream and three kinds of cones."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for ice cream cakes! They have a bunch of different sizes, from petit cakes that serve maybe 4 people to the large round cakes that serve 15+, and a bunch of sheet cake sizes in between. The decorations are well done and they always have a good variety in stock, and the prices are very reasonable. I think the quality of cake/ice cream is just as good as coldstones, although the flavors they keep in stock might not be as exotic. If you want a crazy cake/ice cream combo you can always order ahead."}
{"text":"Lots of ice cream flavors, lots of cone options- what more could you want? My coworkers and I stopped here for a late day treat on a Spring day. I had the moose tracks with a scoop of coffee ice cream- I highly recommend this combination, it was super tasty. Service was quick and the prices were modest. Looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"I've got to say, this scoop shop sure fills a void! Prior to its inception, Bloomfield was sorely lacking in delicious, open-late places to grab a cone of your favorite flavor. That said, there are some bugs in the system.

Pro's: 
Close to where you live (if you're in Bloomfield or Friendship, that is!)
Ice Cream! (it basically sells itself)
Employs local teens
To-go pints are affordable
Has coffee/chocolate flavor, dark chocolate flavor, and an awesome praline almond caramel
Gluten free red velvet cake flavor
Has a bathroom & place to sit

Cons:
Scoops are somewhat pricey for basic Hershey's/Perry's
Flavors do not include some basic favorites (where's the mint chocolate chip?)
The price is a bit steep for a single scoop of no-frills-came-out-of-a-tub ice cream
Not the cleanest place
Confusing array of colors/flavors targeted at kids in unnatural colors - I was a bit put off by the NEON yellow and BRIGHT blue that both look like play-doh in a tub...

I like that this place is nearby, I will likely go back, but there's nothing other than its lack of competition that sets it apart. I appreciate that it employs local kids, but I wish there was something interesting (a flavor of the week the kids who work there created, free topping of the week, etc.)."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge dessert or ice cream lover, but on that rare occasion where I'm craving something, but I don't know what, I know that I can go here and choose something that will be to my liking.  So many flavors! I am certain anyone could go here and find something to tantalize their taste buds. 

The girls working were super nice and friendly, prices beyond reasonable, and the flavors that we tried were great (loved me the Strawberry Cheesecake ice cream). 

I highly recommend this new little neighborhood gem! With so many options and flavors, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I stopped by last night to try some of the spumoni ice cream.  I mentioned to the guy working there that I'd never had this flavor before, and he gave me a sample to try.  I liked it, so I ordered a single scoop of it, and it was quite creamy and delicious.  They also have fresh-made waffle cones for an extra 95 cents, but I decided to be good/cheap and just get a sugar cone, and it was more than sufficient to satisfy my craving.

I have two minor criticisms.  First, the ice cream could have been packed onto the cone a bit more firmly. A couple of times when I was eating the ice cream, it came dangerously close to falling off (note: I'm a biter, not a licker). Second, it was unclear what brand of ice cream I was eating, since there was a Hershey's ice cream decal on the freezer, but I noticed an invoice for Perry's ice cream.  I'm pretty sure most of the ice cream is Perry's, though, since they're listed as a vendor on the Perry's website."}
{"text":"Just your typical Hershey's Ice Cream, nothing wrong with it, but nothing to write home about either."}
{"text":"It was fine. It's a small place with only three stools and no tables, so you can't really sit and enjoy it there.

They have many flavors but it's just big tubs of Hershey's and another brand - nothing special. Hardly any toppings. 

After having worked in a very similar ice cream shop, I can tell you it's probably not suuuper sanitary but it looks clean enough. 

I might go again."}
{"text":"We found this place by accident after seeing Oh Yogurt across the street weirdly closed. Now we have been there three or four times and have never left disappointed. There is usually the same guy working there, and he's really nice. The place is clean and the flavors are good. They usually have about 30. No Frills with the toppings, I usually get some form of chocolate with chocolate jimmies in a cup. Quality stuff!"}
{"text":"Went there with my dog today after a bad start of an experience at Klavons. The gentleman working was so welcoming and warm, even have my pup a bowl of water. The ice cream was good! Very enjoyable!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to drop off a book for UPS and couldn't pass up the ice cream!  So many flavors.  The birthday cake was def. yummy in this tummy!  Will be back again, sooner than later I hope!"}
{"text":"SCOOPS!! Is the best place for ice cream in Bloomfield. They have a TON of flavors to choose from. My personal favorite is birthday cake. I went there a couple days ago and they were out of Birthday cake, so I tried red velvet, and it was just as good! They make their own waffle cones too which are delicious. Scoops is also very reasonable priced. You can ice cream for two people for about $6-$8. Yummy."}
{"text":"I'm not much of an ice cream connoisseur. In fact I rarely eat it. First job was at a Dairy Queen, ruined it for me. That said the Ice Cream at Scoops in Bloomfield was exceptional. It was very rich and creamy the way an ultra-premium ice cream should be. The sugar cone was crisp and stayed that way until I had finished it. 

I only got salted caramel even though that is the trendy flavor of the moment. It was very good with abundant swirls of caramel and whole pieces of chocolate/caramel candies. I didn't really taste much of the \"salt\" though. 

All said, I may need to change my opinion on ice cream with this local establishment a short walk away."}
{"text":"Not bad, just.....basic. They have the basics, hot fudge, caramel, whipped cream, sprinkles...that kind of thing. They carry Hershey's ice cream, which is pretty good, not the the best but certainly not the worst. The one thing I can say is they have quite a few flavors to choose from. If you like the froyo joints with 45 toppings to choose from, this is probably not your place. If you like a decent bowl of ice cream, possibly with some hot fudge and sprinkles, you'll do fine here."}
{"text":"Scoops is great. They have a really extensive selection of flavors. I had a milkshake and it was good. The place itself is a little bare, but you're not there to look at art you're there to get some Scoops!"}
{"text":"This is such a cute neighborhood icecream shop. There are plenty of fun traditional and  non-traditional flavors and best of all, fresh made waffle cones. I was able to see the staff make a milkshake for a customer in front of me and it looked absolutely delicious! The staff was very helpful in obtaining a last minute icecream birthday cake and did such a nice job!  Will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"I had the birthday cake and it was delicious. It's kind of a basic ice cream store but I did enjoy all the 5 flavors that I sampled."}
{"text":"Good ice cream.  Better than twisters.  Cones are too small for a single."}
{"text":"Holy bajesus. Had a sudden and very random craving for ice cream at 8:30pm last night after dinner -- and thank goodness this place was a walkable distance from my home and open till 9:30!!  Props definitely to the latter because what place opens this late in a small neighborhood??

Anyways - first time going there and saw all the great reviews on yelp but oh my lordy... This place was beyond delicious! I tried a number of flavors and honestly couldn't choose between them so I did what made the most sense... Get the first two flavors I tried (cause I'm definitely going back for the rest).

Had the pumpkin and *** sinfully (can't remember the name but it's expresso flavored). Both were perfect - not overly sweet like most places make it but super creamy. Also treated myself even more with their homemade waffle cone. Worth it. 

Definitely going back."}
{"text":"SOOOOO delicious - wide variety of flavors, with options for all taste buds. I got the cookie dough and it was so great and their waffle cones were fresh and well made."}
{"text":"I love Scoops, no simpler way to say it. My family often went to Scoops on the Boulevard when we lived in Brookline so we were thrilled to find out there is a Scoops in Bloomfield. Same ice cream and friendly customer service. I love the birthday cake flavor with a waffle cone and my husband tries a new flavor every time. This will definitely be our regular ice cream shop now that we live in the east part of Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"A visit to Scoops in Bloomfield has become a regular stop for me anytime I find myself along that stretch of Liberty Avenue. There's a wide variety of flavors available to choose from; however, I've yet to try them all. My personal favorites are the Salt Caramel Truffle and Peanut Butter Chocolate. 

Unfortunately, it's a grab your ice cream and go type of place. There's very limited seating inside and by that I mean there's only three or four stools by the window. During the warmer months there's two tables that are usually placed outside, but that's only helpful when it's summer. I'm an all-year ice cream kind of guy."}
{"text":"Delicious!! Great ice cream at a great price! You can't go wrong getting ice cream for 2 for only $5, especially when your cone is filled with hand scooped creamy delicousness!!"}
{"text":"I went with the server's recommendation of the banana cream pie, and I did not regret it.  I love marie calendar's banana cream pie and this ice cream has to be one of the best tasting.  It was creamy and full of chunks of banana and pie.

I got a scoop on the chocolate chip cone.  The special cone was good but it was a little tough to eat.  It wasn't really a cookie nor a wafer, and it didn't really taste like how I imagined it on like an ice cream sandwich.  Lol. Plus points for creativity though.  Next time, I probably would not get a special cone and just save room for another scoop of their delicious ice cream instead."}
{"text":"Be still my beating heart. 

I'm taking an epic walk through Pittsburgh (10 miles through six different neighborhoods), and as I'm near the end of my journey, tired, hungry, maybe even a little delirious, I stumble across a mirage, a figment of my imagination, something far, far too good to be true. I see a brand-new beautiful awning with the words \"Scoops in Bloomfield\". What could it be?  I stagger in and I'm overwhelmed by the vision  of tub after tub of ice cream--every imaginable color and flavor. 

Scoops is yet another new thing in my fabulous neighborhood of Bloomfield. Further proof, along with the new Saturday market, that Bloomfield is the coolest neighborhood in Pittsburgh. Why go anywhere else?

Tonight, they were accepting only cash. They indicated that this is just a temporary problem. So bring your money, honey, and get you some good ice cream!"}
{"text":"So happy to have a new ice cream place in the neighborhood!  Because if we are being honest, if I want ice cream at nine on a Saturday I'm not trying to deal with Oakland, or a place that seems like it is staffed by middle schoolers even though I'm pretty sure that hasn't been legal for a century. 

The flavor selection here is quite extensive. You get a ton of ice cream in a double and the waffle cones are delicious. I got bittersweet sinphony (coffee) and spimoni. The spimoni was the best I've ever had. Price is cheaper than the competition too. There's seating and on a nice night you could just walk across to the friendship parklet too. 

Will definitely be back, people should definitely support their neighborhood places."}
{"text":"When I lived in the South Hills I've often frequented Scoops on Beverly. Now that I live in Bloomfield I am thrilled to be within walking distance to one of their other locations. Nothing super fancy about the place but it's nice and the important thing is the ice cream. It's always fresh and tasty with lots of flavour options."}
{"text":"After a super unfulfilling dinner I felt deserving to have some good ice cream. And this place totally proved its worth.  The prices were ridiculous cheap and the flavours available were awesome.  Definitely try their rich dark chocolate and the coffee with chocolate bits.  I'm not a fan of chocolate but loved how it wasn't too chocolatey but instead just right :)"}
