{"text":"Food is always amazing. I usually get (what should be award winning) buffalo chicken pizza. The staff is always friendly and the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"I Loved this place!  The pizza was great and the wings were crispy good flavor.  The Hersheys ice cream was delicious and nice finishing touch to the great meal.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Mmmmm!  A good 3- 1/2 stars here!  Well since my quest to stop at the nearby Market of Walker's Mill was thwarted due to its closure, I decided to come here instead.  The Rennerdale Corner Store is a good ol' fashioned no-frills pizzeria and sandwich shop.  They've got some interesting hand-tossed pizzas here including a breakfast pizza--eggs, bacon, sausage, cheese, & veggies!  Wonder how that tastes with a good cup of Joe!    Not in the mood for pizza?  They've got a good selection of sandwiches, burgers, hoagies, pita wraps, and wedgies.  Yeah, I know!  Imagine walking into the place and saying to the guy \"Gimme a wedgie!\".  I went for the chicken pita wrap baked in balsamic dressing.  Yum!    So the Rennerdale Corner Store is a little off the beaten path and while its cuisine may not set the world on fire, it's worth checking out.  Note:  although it has a Carnegie mailing address, the place is actually in Rennerdale."}
