{"text":"I think this is my first review on the site. I had to pump the tires of this awesome little spot because it's got a great vibe and SUCH good food. I had a Calamari Po' Boy which I've never seen offered anywhere else. It's definitely up there with my favorite places in Toronto after just one visit and I haven't even had the opportunity to enjoy the backyard patio yet. I had to share with Yelp because I've used it so often to find great spots and I felt like giving back a bit. Trust me on this, you cannot be disappointed by this place."}
{"text":"Went here tonight for the first time and had a pretty good experience. The person serving me was extremely attentive and the service was prompt. Though this may have been because I was one of only 3 people there and the only one there for food. The space is nice and cozy, though I think I only saw a small bit of it. I was looking for something comfy and not to crowded and it was perfect. 

I had the Pork Belly Confit Cubes as my appetizer, they came with a hoisin sauce. The cubes themselves were good but kinda fatty. Like the cubes of meet had random chunks of fat in them and they were a little greasy. But I did enjoy them. I had the burger as my main and that was fantastic. Well seasoned and juicy.

I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Hands down the most unique restaurant I've been to in Toronto. From the location to the decor to the menu nothing was ordinary here. It begins with a location off the beaten path (College) with a house converted into a restaurant. It feels like you are going to a friends for dinner and the homely service matches this feel. The venue has a romantic back patio and indoor seating that does the job, not fancy but comfortable anyway. The menu is not huge but with the mark of a great restaurant it has creative dishes that are executed amazingly. The fried pickles were succulent and the salads were generously garnished with bacon. As for the mains the calamari burger was a heavenly dish. I also ordered a poutine as a side which was not small by any count. 

The prices are not cheap a meal for two including drinks and appetizers came to $60 before tip but the quality is worth the price. I recommend this to anyone looking to excite their taste buds. They also have a craft beer on tap that delicious and my date informs me their mix drinks were stand out as well."}
{"text":"In the intimate space formerly known as Olivia's just tucked off College behind Cafe Diplomatic on Clinton, it's the perfect place for comfort as it's an old restored house with dim lights, and a gorgeous back patio. 

The menu is focused on snacks and sammies with an asian twist with favourites like deep fried pickles and poutine so we order them immediately!  (We did just finish a move so we were starving).  Additionally we try the pork belly confit cubs, chick pea fritters and grilled octopus crostinis on the suggestion of co-owner Mack Chiu.  There are two beers on tap - Beau's and Sapporo with the great presentation of the samurai sword as the tap handle.  
The deep fried pickles are juicy on the inside and crunchy on the outside and totally what we were craving. The poutine was made with real cheese curds with a good base gravy which gave it a good flavour so I was tremendously happy about it. The chick pea fritters are soft and musky as you would expect chick peas to taste.  
The grilled octopus were seasoned well and tender which is good.  The highlight on the snacks were the pork belly confit cubes served with a house made hoisin sesame sauce.  The sweetness of the sauce was delicious compliment to the saltiness of the pork.
I have heard a lot of reviews on the Fuel House's version of the classic vietnamese sandwich with pickled veg and cilantro so I couldn't wait to try their pork belly bahm mi.  It came in a baguette and was full of textures with good crunch and the perfect pickled salty flavour with a little kick with a spicy sriracha sauce added in.   
Other mains we tried were the fish tacos two ways.  I thought it was take on two applications of white fish (tilapia) tacos.  One with pickled onions, lettuce, cilantro and remoulade.  The other had pea sprouts, pickled ginger and wasabi mayo.  
Also we had the fuel house burger which was a good classic burger served with the regular trimmings of ketchup, coleslaw and mayo.
As the weather heats up, the Fuel house will be opening up their garden patio and hosting BBQs and pork roasts.  I can't wait to go back and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Before anything, ask for a Jalapeno Margarita!
All the food is excellent so just get everything and share with your friends."}
{"text":"Essentially, you come here for a chill time. Be prepared to relax and have an intimate meal. :) 

The menu ain't big, but if the food's good (which it is), you don't need infinite choices. 
They keep it simple; order an appetizer (pork belly confit cubes!!), a main (banh mi anyone?!), and enjoy some beer (last time i went, they had Beau's and Sapporo on tap)! 

There's both a flat screen inside the converted victorian house and outside on the patio for your sports viewing pleasure. :D"}
{"text":"Dropped by the Fuel House for a burger and to check out the place - it's like someone's really nice house inside. High ceilings and warm accents, crown moldings, and heavy wood. 

If you've been to Olivia's which used to occupy the space, not much has changed. The addition of the patio in the back will be really quite beautiful- probably enough for 8-10 tables around a giant cherry-tree. Lovely.

They've got Beau's on tap which was nice, a small selection of sandwiches, a burger, some fries, and soup.

I had the burger and fries and tried a smoked-vodka caesar. WTF is that, you ask? Well they had put a bunch of vokda in a smoker and filled it with apple-wood. It was a very autumny drink. Could have had a few of those.

The pork belly Viet-sandwich looked quite nice. Only opened earlier this week, so will be interesting to see how they develop the menu and space (talked about expanding to the 2nd floor as well as the addition of the back patio).

Also, the entire POS system was done on an iPad. WHOA."}
{"text":"I read a review for the Fuel House in Toronto Life, about there Calamari Po'boy sandwich. I knew I had to have it. So on a hot day I donned my leather jacket and ignored the constant calls from Ving Rhames' secretary so I could head up to Little Portugal (or Little Italy I don't even know). 

I was a little concerned walking down College as all the patio'd restaurants were pretty packed and I was just by myself. I walked up Clinton and immediately it was dead, I found this old grey house that said FUEL HOUSE on it and, upon confirming with my phone's GPS, I knew I was in the right spot. It was dead on the inside and I wasn't even sure they were open but a nice fella welcomed me and I sat in the backyard patio. It was very \"noice\" and cozy and sunny. My server was friendly and cool and attentive. I had a $7 Sapporo and was looking forward to burging on this squiddy burger. 

The sandwich I was presented with was amazing and I got fries as well which came with a ketchup and mayo dip thing. I for some reason thought the calamari rings would be deep fried and not squibbly so that threw me off. It wasn't what I was expecting but it was still pretty good. The fries were amazing though, and I don't even eat fries. Prices were reasonable. 

I will definitely go back, but for a different meal, and more fries, perhaps a different drink. It was a nice time and service was speedy. However it was just me and two other tables occupied."}
{"text":"Good gosh, that was delicious! 
We came for a late dinner on the weekend and was happy to have chosen the Fuel House. We arrived to the tucked away locale on Clinton Street and decided to sit inside since we felt a couple drops of rain on our way. The sounds of classic hip hop were being played while we dined.

We started with the Deep Fried Pickles ($4), the Pork Belly Confit Cubes ($5), and a Bacon Wrapped Jalapeno Pepper stuffed with goats cheese ($2.50 each) . The pork belly cubes were tender, savoury and just downright delicious. Highly recommendable. The bacon surrounding the jalapenos was a deliciously thick cut bacon with a great flavour. Next time I'll definitely be making a point of not just ordering 1 for myself. The deep fried pickles were good but admittedly the weak link and didn't come with enough sauce for dipping.

Off to a good start, we followed up with a couple of sandwiches off the menu. I had the burger ($10) which was a decent size and had a piece of that awesome thick cut bacon strewn across the top. The burger was quite tasty, although the side of fries was a little underwhelming, especially at a $3.50 side dish add on. 
My date had the Pulled Turkey Sandwich ($7.50) which I stole a bite of and thought was decent but their \"coffee bbq sauce\" didn't really hit me in the sweet spot that various other pulled meat sandwiches would via. The side of poutine ($5.50) was good and made my regular order of fries seem pale in comparison.

In the end, the food was really enjoyable, the server (although clearly stretched out) was friendly and efficient, and when it was all said and done 2 pints, 2 glasses of wine, 3 apps, 2 sandwiches w/ sides came in around $78 after tax / before tip. 
Definitely a cool spot to check out and now having tries their Pork Belly Confit Cubes appetizer, I can't help but wonder how delicious the Pork Belly Bahn Mi sandwich is. Sounds like reason for a return trip!"}
{"text":"VIBE 
Fuel House is located in the old Olivia's, which I'm guessing used to be a romantic place because when you come in here the ambiance is so romantic. Candlelights; a small area and banquet at the front. It's just all very lovely and not what to expect if you're having banh mi. But in this case, it really does work great for a first date. 

Mackenzie, one of the owners, is very active on twitter and that's how we initially met so I told him I'd come down with a friend to taste. He knew I was hacking up a lung so he offered me 3 cold FX. Yay for having pseudo drug dealers! It wasn't busy so he sat and talked with us. Really, really nice guy. 

He wants to do a few creative things for summer and I think it will go over well, especially with a back patio. Also, if he incorporates brunch that could be a potential resurgence to the College St. strip. 

WE ATE 
The Banh mi and burger. 
The banh mi was not flavoured well. I had to put pepper on it. It was a huge amount and I couldn't even finish my half. That said, if they added a lot more hoisin sauce to give it a kick it may work. He knows this and was graceful about the feedback. 

The burger was good. It was a solid burger but compared to the other concoctions in the city, not my favourite. The bacon on it is fatty and thick an that was a good compliment. Yum.

Ugh, I sound like such a piss ass. 

BUT this is still a great place to go even for a drink! It's also only my first visit so maybe I need to try something else? 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
There's a lot of potential for this place if they focus on the quality of the food and coming up with something inventive or perfecting the basics. I don't want to \"banh\" this on my to-go restaurants! Otherwise, great location, ambiance and service."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend dropped by the fuel house last night. Unfortunately the restaurant was closed, but the owners were nice enough to let us in for a drink. And a delicious drink it was. We each had a smoked vodka caesar (smoked in house!), which was extra spicy and very yummy. I would definitely recommend this drink! they also have Saporro and Beau's on tap. 
The menu is small, mostly sandwiches and looks fabulous. They also have daily specials (yesterday there was a panko breaded tempeh and veggie sandwich- yum!). It's a great atmosphere inside, very quaint and cozy and perfect for a dinner date or drinks with friends. There was also mention of possible menu extension to brunch, which would be fabulous as the brunch scene on college st. is pretty drab. There is also a backyard patio, with a cherry blossom tree, which will open in the summer and will definitely be worth checking out. 
Despite not trying the food, I give this place a solid 5 stars! the owners were super warm and inviting! This is just the type of independent, cheap restaurant we need in this area of college st., with new and inventive dishes !"}
{"text":"I live near by the restaurant and I have been there three times so far since the opening.  Well, all I can say is that the experience has been getting better and better as I notice small incremental improvements everytime I visit. 

Fuel House (FH) is cozy and intimate - not loud, but rather comfortable to enjoy delicious meal (with your date) and stay for drinks after because \"I like the service\".  The asian influenced menu is simple yet the offering is compelling in that I always feel there are several items I want to try and the price is quite reasonable compared to other quality near by establishments on College.  The Pork Belly (sandwich or appetizer) is my definite favourite (ask for sriracha sauce for additional kick if you like spicy food) but other items on the menu are good too, calamary for example is so tender and delicate the way it should be, and even the french fries is interestingly appetizing!  After the meal, we moved to the bar where Stephanie (very personable and she looks like a fitness model) was serving up lovely summer cocktails (cucumber juice based with vodka and gin?) while we were enjoying the ppv boxing event on the screen. 

I am lucky to be living in walking distance from so many decent and excellent restaurents and bars from College and Little Italy, China Town and the Kensington Market, to Korea town restaurants on Bloor.  FH is a definite welcome addition and I would recommend this place \"especially\" if you are waiting for a table at busy places on College - just whip around the.corner to FH for better food and service."}
{"text":"Great, cosy little restaurant. Wi fi and friendly service. Oh, and the food is fantastic."}
{"text":"I don't even realize how intimate the Fuel House is till I walk in the door. It is kind of funny that you can make a reservation through Opentable. 

Hanging out at this place is like hanging out at my friend's house. With just a handful of table for 2, the dining area is already full... I ended up sitting at the bar area with a bunch of guys watching NFL... So for the evening, I had a sport bar experience or a game night at a friend's house.

Menu is really simple sandwiches and more sandwiches.... I ended up with

Pork Belly Banh Mi ($7.50) which was not too bad a little too fatty for my preference but I definitely have better. My extra spicy request was as usual not spicy. I need 2 of this to fill me up...great for a snack with a drink.

2 drafts on taps: Sapporo and Beau's ($6.50) 

I doubt I will bring my date to Fuel House.. Maybe a game day Date?

The bartender/server though is really really nice."}
{"text":"Contrary to their nomenclature, the Fuel House does not sell petrochemicals. But it is indeed a house that serves drinks and casual meals. It's right by the corner of College and Clinton in Little Italy.

The restaurant itself is fairly intimate, so it's not great for groups. Mostly tables for two and bar seating. But the warm decor and quiet ambiance might make it a respectable date destination. There is also a small patio out front, and a spacious garden patio in the back, shaded by a sprawling tree.

Menu consists of snacks 'n' sammiches. On my first visit I tried their pork belly banh mi sandwich ($7.50) and I've also tried their bacon cheeseburger ($10). Both very tasty and filling. Definitely a gem.

Obligatory Title Pun: I pity the FUEL that avoids this spot.

Menu Readability: When we went the specials were written on a chalkboard.

Need to mention: Beau's on tap.

What this place teaches me about myself: The FTR for this place was totally within my grasp. Sometimes I play nice."}
