{"text":"Nothing lavish but  shawarma sandwich generous, very tasty,reasonable price ,cleanliness and service with a smile. What more to expect for a quick lunch. On basis of quality/price deserves fully a 5/5."}
{"text":"Mazaj is my new go to place for shawarma, falaffel, and hummus. I finally tried it two weeks ago after a friend had recommended it. I love their chicken shawarma sandwich. They wrap it slightly differently so the pita is more of a flat rectangle and the pita is crisped up on the panini grill. I really like the texture of the crispy pita. The texture and the flavours of the falaffel were spot on. I also loved the flavour of the hummus. This place is a hidden gem. I would never have tried this place if my friend hadn't told me even though I've walked by it tons of times as it doesn't look like much from the outside."}
{"text":"Nice little restaurant with great staff - very clean. The food however does not live up to five stars that took me in for lunch. I tried the mix plate (beef + chicken + falafel).  The falafel was good but the rest were too dried and didn't taste too great."}
{"text":"I was inside the Scotia center craving some Mediterranean food and the previous reviewers led me here. I ordered the chicken schwarma. Their pita bread is unique with using a double wrap of thin pita. When grilled it left it nice and crisp. The ingredients were fresh and definately tasty. The only issue is that they grilled it for a little too long and the wax paper stuck to my pita. Otherwise, a cost effective way for a quick bite to eat that will leave many satisfied."}
{"text":"Great friendly service.   The guy working behind the counter has been here 20 years.   So much better then the falafel house, not comparable!"}
{"text":"These guys have been making amazing shwarmas for the past 6-7 years. My favorite place in the city."}
{"text":"This hidden gem tucked beside Scotia Center is one of my favorites. I love the traditional pita and the fresh toppings. Great family run lunch spot. I wish I was in that part of town more often."}
{"text":"Came here after the gym and I discovered that it's amazing! It's so clean in here and turns out it's a hidden gem, the food is wonderful and beautiful and healthy :)"}
{"text":"the food is fantastic and totally affordable! The service is great. The owners are really friendly. Everything looks clean and fresh and the smell of cooking when you go in is amazing."}
{"text":"With so many 5-star ratings, I guess I was kind of hyping myself up for this place to be a shawarmatopia. What I found instead after two visits was that it's a great, hole-in-the-wall local shawarma joint that offers reasonably priced, decent food. I had a ton of shawarma when I lived in montreal, and this compares about average in terms of price and quality, which is just fine by my books.   I've tried the beef shawarma and mazaj platter. Overall, the balance is good, but I liked the shawarma much better than the platter. I would not mind a bit more flavor either in the beef or the sauce (either way, it's going to be a messy experience requiring lots of napkins).   A huge plus for me is the (couple?) that run the place - seems like a husband and wife. Both are very cheerful, chatty, and really give it a home-made feel. Based solely on the quality of the food, this is a pretty average, 3-star joint - but the atmosphere, the proximity to where I work, and the price all definitely make this a 4-star location on the whole. Worth checking out, and great to grab a bite when passing by on a workday, but I wouldn't come out of my way for it."}
{"text":"So many 5 stars???? So decided to come here and give it a try. To my surprise, there was hardly anyone inside. They are so dead. My colleague and I walked in and we both order the same thing - Chicken Sharwarma. Their prices are more expensive compared to their competitor and the portion is a lot small as well. I don't know what's with the high rating or maybe they just went downhill all of a sudden.  The chicken sharwarma: I like how the pita bread is crunchy. The meat isn't seasoned very well. I mean I had chicken sharwarma where it would really stand out. Not much strong flavor in it. I do like the fact that they are generous in sauce. I mean I am a sauce person. The portion size is smaller compared to their competitor for the price paying. Also the chicken sharwarma is very messy to eat. It drips from either end.  What's really disgusting is the hair found in my colleagues chicken sharwarma. That was nasty. Well its good that they replaced his half chicken sharwarma and she did try to explain and did apologized.   We came in at noon and left at 12:30. Inside the whole restaurant there was only us and another table. I don't know how they can stay in business longer if they are getting this kind of business everyday. I have walked by couple times and they were not busy."}
{"text":"When working in Bankers Hall, I'd walk over here often. I have tried all the sandwiches, the falafel and the plates!  Yes, I've eaten here lots!!!  Service is quick and friendly and I enjoy this during the lunch hour. Food courts get boring fast and I'd eat inside in the winter but get my sandwich to go in warmer weather so I could sit outside for the sunshine and people watching. It's not that noticeable of a location but recommend it if you're in the area.   My faves are the crunchy falafels and the chicken shawarma.  Served fresh n hot!!!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem is the best way to describe this place. I don't think you'd ever notice it if you don't work in the area. However, you *have* to check this place out. This place is delicious. A co-worker recommended it to me for the beef shawarma but I ended up getting falafel and a potato pie. My friend got the tabouli.   Everything was incredibly tasty. I was commenting to my friend that my problem with falafel is that many places have a good mix, but they over fry. That means you get these rock hard patties and a bitter taste. Mazaj knows how to do it right. They are seriously delicious and perfectly fried. The other side dishes are also excellent, and they soak the meat after they take it off of the spit in order to keep it moist.   The portions are huge. I was full off of the potato and half of the falafel. That just meant I had some for later. :-)   Either way, you really need to check this place out - it is actually on the same level of the shawarma that I use to get when I was in Egypt."}
{"text":"Very good and healthy shawarmas... I really liked them!! In addition the service is very fast and the location is very convenient... This place is recommended for a quick, healthy and good tasting lunch!!"}
{"text":"Strictly speaking about food quality, service speed, portion size, and prices - it is a strong four-star contender.  One thing made Mazaj stick out of the crowd for me, though. While some people do their job, for others their job is a work of love. And such people set the bar and redefine experiences.  Mazaj folks did just that to me, becoming a model Mediterranean place in my books.  Work of love - this is how I would characterize Mazaj. Just look how patiently and carefully each of the countless thousands of plates is getting prepared, arranged, handed to you. How genuinely friendly (actually recognizing your face in a countless flock of people!) owners of Mazaj greet you - that's not fake, that's honestly human!  They care, and it shines. Especially in faceless and busy corporate downtown.  Absolutely pleasant surprise, given that from outside this place does not look like a big deal - but I strongly recommend you to drop in and give it a try. I was amazed, and returned more than a few times - hope you will, too."}
