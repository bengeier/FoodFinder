{"text":"This is a gem. Quality delicious food...service is impeccable and the owner is kind and engaging. Always a great choice for Italian food. Tonight we had the pleasure of having Sandra take care of us...she was AWESOME."}
{"text":"I have had the pleasure of dining at EVOO multiple times with great food and great service from a wonderful female server (her name escapes me, but she is excellent).  Because of those experiences and after raving to family and friends and bringing them to try the restaurant to try, I decided to have my birthday dinner there last night at 6 pm. 

I made a reservation early in previous week and was promptly told we have a two-hour limit.  OK..... cool.   That evening,  the express on the 401 had all lanes closed,  requiring us to take local traffic from Peel. Many of us arrived late.  I called the restaurant to let them know about the ETA and they said no problem.  When half of the guests arrived at 6:30, the server was very curt and said,  \"I don't know who X is that made the reservation (not to me, but a guest),  but you guys have to be out of here by 8:15. You were told that when the reservation was made, soooo\". Ummm,  happy birthday to me?  Very unprofessional. 

He gave us water and asked us if we wanted to order.  He did not tell us the specials and kept glancing at other servers as if we were a nuisance.  I then asked for the specials and he prattled them off quickly,  but only to me and not the whole table and promptly left, so there was no time to ask questions or for recommendations.  We kind of halfway heard what the specials were and stuck with the regular menu.   Upon his return, some of my guests asked for meal suggestions and what was popular and the server looked super annoyed and any dish inquired about was \"good\", barely engaging or making eye contact and snatching the menus quickly.  Every time he left the table, we noticed the chilliness and felt quite uncomfortable.   

The food came super quickly,  but tasted like it, and was definitely not what I was accustomed to in terms of flavour and quality. It was very disappointing (pool of water under my pasta, maybe not drained properly?).  When the rest of my guests arrived,  they were asked if they wanted drinks because there  wasn't enough time for them to eat and we have to be out by 8:15 and so,  they didn't. After hours in traffic....There was no happy birthday,  warmth, patience,  kindness, nothing. Just a hurry up and get out attitude throughout the evening.  The entire night was characterized by nervous glances and a sense of \"please leave quickly\". I've never felt so uncomfortable and unwelcome in a restaurant. Ever. It was a terrible feeling. 

Needless to say,  my birthday was ruined,  I couldn't order dessert and have my guests celebrate with me because I was rushed through my meal and reminded at least three times that I had to leave by 8:15 and in every way possible,  to hurry up.  My birthday was not acknowledged despite it being mentioned multiple times.  I am gravely dissapointed and hurt by my experience. I was treated like a nuisance the entire time and it soured my birthday evening and made things awkward. 

We were still hungry, insulted, and irritated,  so we went to another restaurant and continued the evening there,  with much better service.  We were actually able to relax,  makes jokes, chat,  and enjoy each other's company because we weren't being reminded to get out ASAP almost every time the server came by! I take full responsibility for arriving late,  but who could have forseen half of the highway shutting down?  If they could no longer accommodate my party of 6, they should have let us know when I called to let them know I would be arriving late.  Myself and my guests arrived with one hour and forty-five minutes left and were still treated like crap and an inconvenience. 

I will not be returning or recommending this restaurant to anyone ever again. If I could give them zero stars,  I would.  They weren't accommodating, friendly, professional, or polite, and made us feel very unwelcome.  Disappointed."}
{"text":"Everything was really delicious.
We had the Calamari as an appetizer. Gnocchi,
Seafood linguini, penne Alla vodka and Caesar salad. The only disappointment was the lava cake. Ice cream flavor didn't compliment the cake and the cake was not very good. But everything was fabulous!"}
{"text":"Love the place and the people. Recently I have eaten there 3 times and have enjoyed everything about the meal."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, great service and all for and for an implacable value. Super friendly staff that are always there when you need them. Wine was reasonably priced. We will be back in bigger numbers :)

Thank you"}
{"text":"EVOO is an outstanding restaurant. We have been going to EVOO since it opened, and before then, to Peter's previous restaurant, Spuntini. EVOO is just a reincarnation of the spectacular menu, service, drinks and customer service that he provided with his former restaurant. From the minute you walk in, you are greeted as an old friend. r
Regardless if it is your first visit, or 50th, you are greeted with the same warm smile, friendliness, and VIP treatment. IF you have to wait for any length of time, they will offer you a drink of your choice to thank you for your patience. Again, customer service bar none.
The food is consistently outstanding. Whatever dietary restrictions you may have, the kitchen will accommodate you as they are extremely empathetic to food sensitivities and allergies.
Wait staff are attentive and will usually bring you out an after-dinner liqueur as a Thank You, for sharing in the EVOO experience.
You will not be disappointed. EVOO is 5 star through and through!!!
Come for the food and ambiance, and leave satiated and satisfied. You WILL want to come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Nothing revolutionary, but a good quality spot for a lively lunch or dinner. 

Highlight: Excellent service. Pushy in a good way."}
{"text":"I was so incredibly impressed by this place. The wait staff were on top of everything -- so many individuals making our experience as enjoyable as possible. 

I had a nice Malbec to accompany my lamb ragu. Both on point 

We had reservations at 8:30 on a Monday - it was really busy during standard dinner hours however, it cleared out pretty quickly and we were one of the last to leave. 

I'd definitely recommend this spot - its warm, inviting, great for most occasions (or a plain dinner out) and the food/drink goes down nicely too!"}
{"text":"We had a fantastic meal at EVOO last night. The staff was excellent. The food was done perfectly only one problem. For those people that wear hearing aids., the sound was pretty intense.  Would hope that the restaurant would eventually put sound deadening material on ceiling.   Other than that, I WILL RETURN"}
{"text":"Evoo Ristorante recently opened end of February (which was the former Spuntini's Restaurant on Avenue Road) which was my favourite restaurant!  Firstly, you are welcomed with a warm greeting from David and then from the Peter the owner.  The d√©cor is very nice with candles and very cozy.  We started with an antipasto de casa for two was excellent, garlic shrimp just melted in your mouth, then I had the spaghetti al divo (which was a spaghetti in a rose sauce with chicken and sundried tomatoes) fabulous dish and my hubby had the Vitello Milanese(breaded veal with spaghetti with tomatoe sauce) which he loved and portions were generous.  Food and atmosphere is excellent a must try !  Can't wait to return in two weeks :)"}
{"text":"My father and I came across Evoo by accident. We were heading to a local seafood place but it was closed on a Sunday. Evoo had not only an amazing atmosphere but also amazing service and food. It's Italian/ Western fare and the cost is indicative of the quality of food and presentation. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My friends and I come to Toronto Pride every year, and we make a point to eat here. The food here is awesome, and the servers are charming. This year, I got the risotto, which was very creamy and flavorful. The risotto was al dente enough without being hard like many risottos. Our group shared a polenta dish and buratta, which was delicious, and we had a slice of chocolate cake for dessert. The food is all decently priced; we ended up spending around $35 USD including a bottle of white wine. The olive oil for dipping is also fantastic!"}
{"text":"A gem of a restaurant. Evoo was recommended by the concierge at our hotel.  The restaurant was charming (though a bit loud on this Saturday night) and the food was great. Hubby started with a potato leek soup and me with a salad that featured crusted goat cheese, arugula and pears - both were delicious.  Hubby's house made lobster ravioli had a lovely sauce. My rigatoni dish was light and delicate. I also appreciated the chef customizing it to accommodate my food allergies.  The dessert, a coconut cream cake, was light and yummy.  Staff was gracious and very friendly."}
{"text":"4.5 stars. I've done one lunch and four dinners here over 8 mths. This is a very good restaurant with fine food and attentive staff. The noise level is high. Pasta dishes are very generous, fish is fresh, apps excellent. In the Annex/Midtown, this is the best Italian resto on offer by a wide margin."}
{"text":"How could you not give this place 5 stars  from the minute you walk in with their welcoming service and setting you already know you are going to enjoy the food! Although it is an upscale restaurant located in yorkville they still have a down to earth vibe. meaning whatever mood you are in they will make sure to host exactly that energy. 

What to say about the food  it's Evoo and amazing, no wonder why all the celebrities go there. My go to for Italian is ravioli and it's was fantastic!! Pictures don't do it justice. Just go and you will see!"}
{"text":"I passed by this little wine bar for so many times, so I decide to give a try tonight.  With Joso and Sotto sotto around, it first appears to me that this ristorante might not be as stand out.  However, the food and service are both on par with Joso and Sotto Sotto.  We ordered a white wine seafood pasta, seafood soup, lamb rack and salmon.  All the dishes are amazing, it is a good alternative to Joso and Sotto Sotto if those two are fully booked.  Actually the seating is more comfy than Joso as well.  Another good choice for dinner and it won't disappoint you!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful surprise!  Dined at EVOO last night not knowing what to expect.  It is in our neighborhood and we have walked by hundreds of times -- so glad we decided to meet a friend there yesterday.  Top marks in all categories.  A few observations:

1. very nice cocktails, both signature and classic (and extremely generous pour on my martini).
2. Superb wine list, not just the Italian section, but California and Oregon as well. Fair and accessible prices too.
3. The menu is on the traditional side, but _all) dishes were well executed; with the fresh grilled fish as a standout.
4. Crab ravioli was exquisite, and the cream sauce, which is tricky to pull off, was perfect: light and a complement to the pasta and not at all glommy, even as it cooled a bit.
5. Attentive service
6. Somewhat older crowd: we are in our late 50s and we were the youngest there.  A slightly stuffy atmosphere, but very pleased to have a quiet dining room.

Cannot wait to return."}
{"text":"Went for my father-in laws birthday with a group of 9 and food, service and ambiance was great. Outside of the crab ravioli, everything else was great. Especially the lava cake which was one of the best deserts I have had. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"went here for my birthday dinner with my boyfriend on a wednesday at 7:30. i had made a reservation weeks before (which I highly recommend doing!) When we got there, there was another couple waiting to be seated. no problem, we waited. they took my name and then proceeded to take two other parties names where they were seated before us. we didn't wait too long to be seated but i thought we should have been seated first since we got there first.

anyway, once we were seated it was great. the waiter recommended a very nice Italian red wine, we got calamari, which was amazing. I got the spinach salad which sounded better than it was. i think it couldve used more dressing and if they candied the walnuts it wouldve really been good. for entrees we both got the penne a la vodka and it was incredible. spent about $150 including tip.

all in all i would definitely go back."}
{"text":"High European experience at this tony Yorkville restaurant. 

As their name would indicate, great olive oil.  Friendly and attentive service made us feel like we were in Rome.  Great seafood linguini -- cooked perfectly.  Good Caprese and Lamb Tagliatteli.

Decent winelist but some US wines are very overpriced."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places!!!! I can't tell you enough, all the staff there is such a delight, you cant' stop but smiling.  Vin selection is great, food is amazing, they are always open to creating a very special platter for you and just for you... Cozy, friendly, warm and oh, tasty place!"}
{"text":"The food was well made, however portions were a bit on the smaller scale for the price we paid. We were not 100% pleased with the staff (He brought a bowl of parmesan cheese and left it on the table for \"self-serve\" but I saw them serve the cheese for other tables). The dessert was extremely dry. I'm used to having the chocolate lava cakes actually have sauce pouring out when you dig in. This did not and was a huge disappointment."}
