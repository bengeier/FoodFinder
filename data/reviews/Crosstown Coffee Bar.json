{"text":"Great coffee! Barista is friendly and patient with my decision process. This place has lots of sunlight. Great to chill on a Sun afternoon :)"}
{"text":"We started coming to this gem, and haven't stopped. Espresso, macchiato, cappuccino, flat white, full caf,half caf and decaf; we've tried them all and have been impressed every time. We even buy our beans here. The baristas are exceptionally knowledgeable and super friendly - not in the least bit snooty as they can be at some independents. 
The treats are also delish and the music and vibe are lovely, but for us it's all about the bean and the roast and the pour and these guys are spot on. So glad they chose our neighbourhood and with the construction off the street it's a calm lovely start to my day. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Great little coffee shop tucked away off Ellington Avenue right near the Petri Canada. Skip whater crop they're selling at the station and cut through the trees to this little oasis for something of quality. Nice simple to the point that decor and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Lovely little cafe. The barista was agreeably chatty and full of character. It really brightens an otherwise fairly dreary neighbourhood. And I do like those pecan squares."}
{"text":"This coffee shop is my favourite. It is small, but worth visiting if you are in the (convenient) neighborhood. The baristas are really nice and friendly, and they do their job well. I also love their pretty mugs. Bonus: they have awesome baked goods, including gluten-free!"}
{"text":"I've been going to crosstown most days after school for about a month now, and not only are the baristas incredibly friendly and easy to talk to, but the coffee is damn good too, as is the wifi. whether you are just stopping by for a drink, or going there for a few hours to study, its perfect, with tea pots they'll refill with water, tasty snacks and a cozy atmosphere."}
{"text":"Amazing coffee! Great staff! Delicious treats! Love the little tea pots, a great find in this neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"A real gem hidden away on a side street just off of Eglinton West.

Had some time to kill before a job interview today, so I figured I'd explore the neighbourhood a bit. Stumbled across this place and it was just the thing I needed to give me come extra pep before my interview. I ordered an almond milk latte, which was bomb - smooth, just the right amount of sweetness, perfect temp, and perfect ratio of espresso to milk to foam. The barista was super friendly and a good conversationalist. The decor is rustic and casual - it kind of makes you want to move in and never leave =) Inside, there are a few small tables and a few bar stools set up at the counter and by the window. Outside, there are a few more small tables, two wooden benches, and a few Adirondack chairs (!). The only issue with my visit was that the air conditioning was not on (or not working) on the day I went and it was sweltering inside and out.

Air conditioning issue aside, there is nothing about this place that I don't love. I will be back for sure, time and time again."}
{"text":"Good coffee, but if I go there anywhere close to the advertised closing hours, they're somehow always already closed. Went there today and the guy was cleaning up, door open, open sign in the window, no service (or apologies). Things like that are the difference between me being a loyal, local patron and someone who just chooses not to go there."}
{"text":"What a nice little coffee bar this is! It's currently a bit hidden by some construction but it's all worth it. I've already been here twice since opening (12 days ago). I've tried their iced latte, mocha, espresso shot and cookie and it's all been great. Love the vibe there. Why? 'Cause of Sasha and Monica :). Seriously, you don't get that at every single coffee shop..."}
{"text":"This is a real coffee shop.  By that I mean they don't serve much of anything else.  The have a few pastries that didn't look very appetizing so Arshawn and I just grabbed a Cortado.   They use Hale coffee beans which have a bit of a wood/earth taste to them.  The Cortado was strong and good.  I would come back more often if they had a larger selection of snacks and pastries since I rarely go to a place to only have coffee."}
{"text":"The owner, Sasha, makes great espresso drinks. Her roaster is Hale Coffee. Great little shop not too far from the Yonge & Eg juste and bustle."}
{"text":"The secret's out: tiny tucked away Crosstown has some of the best mud in Toronto. Friendly staff and great pastry. Don't hesitate if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Very cute local cafe! Came in here out of random...Glad I did.. great tasting lattes and they are environmental cautious! Biodegradable coffee cups!!!! Love this place!!! Not to mention the yummy treats they have."}
{"text":"Excellent coffee, yummy goodies.  Perfect quiet location (easy parking).   It's a little out of the way from the Y& E intersection, but worth the walk."}
{"text":"This new coffee place is quite quaint; tucked in the neighbourhood west of Yonge and Eglington. The place is clean but warm inside. No AC and my friend and I sat inside where the windows were. Although we went right in the afternoon when the sun was blaring. It has free WiFi. The staff was very friendly offering us water on top of our order.

I ordered an iced coffee with milk. The two were well-mixed and he made my iced coffee with espresso. Made my drink with a stronger taste which I liked."}
{"text":"Nice neighbourhood Cafe. Good pastries, friendly service, nice clean and quiet environment. In comparison to other places, I found their coffee a bit too acidic. However it's better than Starbucks or Aroma. I had one of their muffins and it was fresh and flavourful."}
{"text":"This sunny lil coffee spot in upper Forest Hill (near Yonge & Eg) serves up delicious espressos and wonderful lattes. They also have ridiculously friendly staff and a small yet tempting selection of treats. And if that wasn't enough, weather permitting, they now have patio seating. What more do you want from a neighbourhood coffeehouse?

Tip: Another great indie coffeehouse is just a couple blocks west along Eglinton...the Mad Bean.

Screw Starbucks and support independent coffee shops! :)"}
{"text":"Yummy tea, delicious snacks, nicely furnished, and friendly staff and patrons. This is my favorite coffee shop! I can't speak to the quality of the coffee (I'm not a coffee drinker) but I love everything else."}
{"text":"I am a fan! I was hearing mixed things on the place from people in the neighbourhood. Nothing bad just some people loved it & others saying it was just good. I am a member of the loving it team. I've only been once but I will be going back soon. The place has a great vibe to it. It's really welcoming, warm, bright & sunny. I loved it. They have a fairly simple menu that I really like. I ordered a cappuccino with soy milk & it's delicious. I adore the fact that they don't charge extra for soy milk. They had some little nibbles out on the counter including a gluten free, vegan tray. That won me over right there. I can't wait to try another drink on the menu. Super adorable place. Worth checking out."}
{"text":"I love this place! I saw it on the way home one day and couldn't wait to try it. I'm a huge fan of small independent coffee shops and cafes. I love that it's very hidden away from the rest of Eglinton... Literally a hole in the wall, but very charming! 

The gentleman who served my coffee and chocolate croissant was very accommodating and friendly. There is free wi-fi and a small table near the window where people can sit. There's also a small patio outside, but the construction that's blocking the cafe is not a great attraction. 

The coffee was wonderful! Dark and rich; just how I like it. And their croissants were from La Bamboche just down the road. Very tasty. 

I saw somebody order the ice cream sandwich which I will definitely try next time. 
If you live nearby, it's worth trying for sure. It reminds me of Montreal and their breezy, easy-going atmosphere. Great music too!"}
{"text":"Lovely intimate place for coffee on cool winter day. Great personal touch by owners. Will be back and bring friends next time"}
{"text":"A good coffee place that is a little away from the busy Yonge and Eglinton area but really close to the  community center where the kids go for their sport activities. I am so looking forward to the next time I have to wait for an hour for the activities to finish :)

As far as coffee is concerned, I have tried their cold brew and a Cortado. The cold brew tasted so good, just have to remember to ask not to put too much ice and less milk. The Cortado was not bad either and I appreciate the fact that the barista made it for me even though it's not on the menu.

Now for my nitpick... they do not have a cup for if you want to drink your coffee in the store, only to-go paper cups. I love my coffee especially if it's on a regular cup and not the paper variety. If it's a regular brew, it is probably ok. But for an espresso-based drink, this is a no-no. I know it's supposed to be a nitpick, unfortunately, this is a big deal for me , enough to cost this review one star less.

Having said that, I'll definitely come back and come back often!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Coffee is great. Friendly service. Love having a small local shop close by. Americano is great... Drip coffee is great. Only suggestion is that the samovars that they keep their drip in don't match their overall ambiance - they look cheap diner-ish. Hopefully a bit of an upgrade is coming there."}
{"text":"Love love love

Only about 3 tables and a window area but if you get a seat, it's a sweet set up. The latte is to die for and my friend had one made with coconut milk which she absolutely adored. Great little treats to go with your coffee too. 

There is street parking. Around $1.50/hour"}
