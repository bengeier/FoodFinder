{"text":"Really small portion of fish in rolls and sashimi. Wouldn't recommend or go back.

We ordered a good number of items and they were all the same size."}
{"text":"Love Love Love Maruju!! this place is one of those hidden gems that once you find you make your regular stop . Everything from the food to the service is always excellent and beyond satisfying, the sushi is so fresh and the menu often has specials that are mind blowing creations by the chef that are always a must try! all in all this is my go to sushi restaurant and i know so many people that feel the same way. If you havent tried you better run to it. Thanks Maruju! and see you soon :)"}
{"text":"When we're feeling like tasty sushi that's not too expensive, we go to Maruju.  

Been coming here for about 2 years and have never really been disappointed, both sit-in and takeout.  Rolls are always put together well and the fish pretty fresh.  I enjoy trying some of the \"special\" rolls that change (Mango Salmon California Roll this month is GOOD) and find the sashimi to be pretty good slices compared to some other places.  Obviously, it's not the best sushi you can find in the city, but I'm always happy with the taste and presentation of the food at Maruju.

Staff are always really friendly and I've noticed low turnover with the same staff being around longer than other restaurants I've been to.  This is nice as it makes us feel welcome and I quite enjoy consistency of staff in eating establishments.  

All in all, I love coming here for sushi dinners and I never feel like I break the bank when I visit... unless I eat too much, that is.  If you're nearby, definitely give them a try and order my favourite roll from Maraju, the spicy tempura tuna roll... soooooo yum!"}
{"text":"The Tom yung Ramen is the best. He uses special noodles,  you can taste a difference it's delious.  Even though the owner says Ramen is just his hobby it's a must have."}
{"text":"Udon noodle soup was alright, albeit lacking in vegetables... But the sushi was not good at all. Pieces were too large and not fresh at all. Will not be going back, unfortunately."}
{"text":"When Maruju first opened up, it was one of my favorite places to go for Japanese food.  Their sashimi was half an inch thick, it was heaven.....and their $1 Tamago sushi was also to die for.  

It has been at least a year since I have been to Maraju for dinner, so my friends and I decided to go there for dinner.  As time goes by, the thickness of each sashimi is noticeably thinner....and no more $1 Tamago sushi.  

They do have some new dishes on the menu...we have tried this baked oysters.  One order comes with two large baked oysters.  It was delicious.  Also the Unagi Tower roll was also interesting.  (Sorry we were so hungry last night that I didn't have a chance to take pics of the food).  

Overall, I think this is a nice, cozy restaurant to dine with your beloved ones.  I just wish that the quality (the thickness) of the sushi/sashimi would go back to what it was when it first opened."}
{"text":"Maruju sushi is one of my favourite sushi places in Calgary! It has excellent quality sashimi which is very fresh. This place also isn't expensive, definitely try it out if you are looking for a good local sushi restaurant!"}
{"text":"We wanted to try something other than Wa's - Marjuju has really reasonable prices. We both ordered a selection of nigiri and maki for $13.00. Surprisingly - the nigiri was really fresh tasting - particularly the more expensive cuts. The maki roll was just okay. The rice was bit gummy. Next time I think we'll just stick with nigiri. Also I didn't like being charged $4.00 for our weak tea. Nigiri is some of the cheapest I've seen in the city and the quality is pretty good."}
{"text":"We go here if we want some decent ramen and creative rolls. It's open a little later than most other sushi joints and I've never had to make a reso. Service can be a little slow but they're friendly peoples. 3.8/5"}
{"text":"The place is nice, the staff are friendly and the quality is good. The only reason I am not giving them a 5-Star is that their rolls were too big, too loose and poorly rolled.

Going back for sure."}
{"text":"The food here is outstanding.  I wish the restaurant wasn't right across the street from my business because I want to go there everyday and eat too much.  I love the shrimp dumplings and several of the rolls.  It might be the best sushi in town.  So delicious and not too expensive. They close between lunch and dinner which is annoying because sometimes it is closed when we go if we're not paying attention to the time. Lol."}
{"text":"Not much I can go on for my meal today. I came in for dinner craving sushi. Not being too hungry, I ordered two rolls - the angel roll and the maruju roll. 

The angel roll would be my highlight of my meal as it had many components contributing to it's overall flavour. It had shrimp, salmon, and unagi. The chef's sauce on the plate was also delicious and a great compliment to the roll. 

The maruju roll was a little bit of a let down for me. It had salmon skin, salmon, and avocado as the main components. Though it had a good taste, they did not live up to the hype of the server's recommendations. The texture was there, but the flavour was one dimensional. 

The service was very friendly. I would give 3.5 stats if I could (may need to revisit this after trying more menu items)."}
