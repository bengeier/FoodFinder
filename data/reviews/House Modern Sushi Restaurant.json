{"text":"Came here on our way home from work to try a new sushi restaurant, and we're glad we did! The Vegas roll was the best I've had in Arizona.  We also had delicious mochi ice cream for dessert! The atmosphere and service was great. It also helps that there was a pokestop in the restaurant."}
{"text":"I didn't like sushi until i started eating here. The sushi rolls are excellent and are almost to pretty to eat. I like the infusion of other cultures in some rolls. A good roll is the 69, excellent!! It's rarely full and service is prompt. Talk to the owners they are nice and will always cater to your needs."}
{"text":"The sushi is good. I crave the shrimp cracker at least once a week and I've never even heard of it before coming here. The service from the women always sucks but the guy who works there is on top of it. I'm in the service industry and if the sushi wasn't so good, I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"I read the reviews here and tried it. I loved it. I will be back. All that was missing was some sake and they will soon have their liquor licence."}
{"text":"Sushi is really good ! I love the jalapeño poppers that they sell they are super yummy. The customer service is excellent. I would differently recommend this restaurant to sushi lovers!"}
{"text":"Great sushi selection and very fresh! Love the plating and design of each dish. There are a good variety of non-sushi dishes such as udon, soba; no ramen options though.  Service varies depending on the waiter/waitress working."}
{"text":"I ended up coming here because the other sushi place in the same strip mall was closed for a private party, but I was very grateful that I came here instead. The selections were awesome, and they were willing to accommodate my request for soy paper instead of seaweed for a small surcharge, which I always appreciate. The rolls ended up being enormous, and I was incredibly thankful that the waiter had the foresight to stagger the timing of our rolls. My boyfriend and I weren't able to finish everything, so we were able to cancel one of our rolls before they started making it. Warning: 2 rolls per person is plenty. We normally have no trouble putting away 5-6 rolls between us, but we definitely underestimated our abilities this time. Plus, they told us that the soybean paper is larger than the seaweed, so it makes the whole roll thicker and that's why it is $1 per roll extra. Anyway, these were some of the best rolls we have ever had, and I was soooooo upset when we got back to the hotel and I forgot the leftovers of our meal in the car. Don't waste any of this deliciousness!! You will regret it!!"}
{"text":"Great hidden sushi place next to a big movie theatre. Went there for the first time with my fiancee and friend from San Diego. We were all impressed with the rolls we ordered, the waitress was very helpful, and she taught us the correct way to do sushi bombs. Also, they were doing 30% off rolls so with all the rolls we ordered and the sushi bombs and a few beers, our bill was only around $70 for the three of us. Good deal for awesome sushi and drinks! I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"SO GOOD!!!!!!! The only roll I got that wasn't good was a lobster roll. It just had no flavor. Everything else I had was AMAZING!!!  Now that I'm done raving about the food, I do have two complaints. 1) The hostess wasn't super friendly or anything. She was really hard to understand and made no effort to speak more clearly so we'd know what she was talking about. 2) There's no where near enough tables. The place is an okay size but there's probably only like 10 tables? Maybe I'm remembering wrong. There's also no sushi bar, which I don't care about, but some people do."}
{"text":"Incredible food.  It is a small place, family owned so not a lot of staff which makes for slow food delivery.  However, I highly recommend it and can't wait to go back.  We ordered 8 different types of sushi and they were all flavorful and inventive."}
{"text":"This place wasn't very good. I see it all the time when I go to the movies next door so I thought for once I'll try it out.   It got off to a bad start when my fiance went to the restroom and said it was the worst one she had been in in a restaurant.  She ordered the chicken teriyake and it wasn't very good, it was lukewarm. I had intended to order sushi but I saw no sushi bar and there were no pictures that seemed to match what other people were having, so I went with something else. The service wasn't spectacular. The one and only guy in there yelled across the restaurant to see if we were ok more than once.  I'll not be coming back. There are better options out there."}
{"text":"Went here today with my wife, the Sushi was so much better than I expected from this little place in a strip mall. We will definitely be back, the staff were courteous and friendly and they got all the little special requests we had for our Sushi correct which is a rarity. My wife does not like cucumber or avo and usually ends up having to remove it even after asking for it to be omitted, this place got it all right every time!  We have been to a number of other Sushi places in the valley and this one was definitely right up there with the best.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is, without a doubt, one of my favorite sushi restaurants ever!! The food is always fabulous. The service is wonderful. This has become our weekly haunt for great food. One of our regular orders is the Japanese lasagna. A super tasty dish."}
{"text":"Had our Father's Day lunch here and boy was it good. I'm not a huge sushi person but the selections they had were so fun and unique. There was something for everyone. Delicious and creatively decorated. Don't forget to look up at the ceiling when you go in to see some beautiful cloud art."}
{"text":"Great service and great food. Sushi is one of my favorite foods and this place does it for me.  Recommend the Japanese Lasagna roll. It's creamy and tastes great.  Lunch crowd can be light but get there early for dinner."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were a little iffy about how long it took the waitress to take our drink orders, but man did the food make up for it. We ordered the What The Heck, the Japanese Lasagna, the Fuji, and the Vegas. Each one was so, so delicious."}
{"text":"Just visited House Sushi for the first time and I had a great experience. The sushi was delicious and you can tell it was prepared with integrity. I wish I would have caught my servers name because he was very attentive and polite. Will be returning!"}
{"text":"The rolls were ok but I've had better. I tried this place because it was closer to home. I was excited with the menu at first because the rolls were very unique. They look fun too but they're more for show and less about taste in my opinion. The service wasn't good either. It was a young college age kid who clearly wanted to be on her phone more than helping us. My fiancé even had to get up and approach her to give her our drink order. She only dropped off waters and never asked if we wanted to order a beverage. The prices are good, they have a 20% off special during the weekdays. All in all I just won't be going back. We'd rather make the extra drive out to our favorite sushi place."}
{"text":"I went in on a dinner date on a Thursday night.  Overall I am really satisfied with this restaurant. The place was really modern and unlike any sushi place I have ever been to. All the sushi is prepared in the back, not in front of you.  The quality of the food was superb, and overall the best sushi I have had in Arizona. The menu is full of many creative choices that I have not seen anywhere else. I highly recommend the \"what the heck\" roll."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! There are a few must tries:  Lion roll Amigo roll Caterpillar roll What the heck roll  House salad and calamari compliment each other well. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Thanks yelpers for finding this place. I tried it based on the outstanding reviews and was not disappointed.   I went for the Tuna Kurai thinking I could stand the heat, but it was intense and delicious. I ordered a side of rice with it to calm the spice a little cuz I'm kind of a weakling when it comes to spicy food, so definitely try it if you enjoy a spicy kick.   Been craving sushi and will probably hit this place up this weekend :)"}
{"text":"Great service and great sushi!  Their Shrimp Cracker appetizer is amazing, everyone should get it."}
{"text":"Went in for an early dinner. Very clean, service prompt. The food was amazing! Prices were great too. We ordered tea but didn't realize it was flavored tea. When we switched to water half way through our meal the waiter took off our charge for the tea. Which was completely unexpected and very thoughtful. Definitely going to make this our go to for sushi night in the future."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try House for some time, and we finally stopped by on a Sunday evening.  Best.  Decision.  Ever.  House Modern Sushi has amazing sushi and rolls. Try the tuna karai if you are able to withstand the heat! It was absolutely delicious.  Not only was the sushi fantastic,  but the service was great as well. The place is run by a family, and the atmosphere is trendy (or Modern, tee hee) but also relaxed and comfortable.  We were back at House in another few weeks and the experience was just as wonderful.  Some of our favorites are the sixty-nine roll, the surf and turf, and the salmon lovers roll (ask for this one last, it's like dessert!)  The restaurant itself is a bit small,  but would be able to accommodate a large party due to the layout.  Don't miss their all day happy hour right now, all rolls are 30% off!"}
{"text":"I too wanted to eat @ L&L's the past weekend, strangely found out that they closed. They asked us what we usually get and they offered chicken katsu so what the heck, might as well give it a try. I have never been to a sushi restaurant with modern music, pretty different i must say, not in a  bad way. The staff was friendly and energetic, the food, just WOW.   Im not sure what this other person saying the sushi is worse than costco sushi because its one of the best I've ever tasted and I've eaten a lot of it. Not a real sushi enthusiast, so try something else like katsu smart guy.  Then came dessert, usually we'd skip on that but one of the friends said sure why not, what we got was ice cream tempura which was just a nice scoop of ice cream battered in panko flakes and cut open, you NEED to try this, it IS the icing on the cake.  I feel that this place is gonna get popular or at least should, it seems like a family owned business, not some chain restaurant that you'd go to everyday. So if you got the time, give them a try."}
{"text":"I came in with a group of friends on a Sunday. We tried the spider, Vegas, Leo, sixty nine and dynamite rolls. I was very disappointed in the small amount of soft shelled crab in the spider rolls but the sixty nine rolls were fantastic! They have an average selection of sake but they have a great selection of asian beers such as Orion and Crass. Overall good for the price."}
{"text":"***Please Read This Review*** C'mon Yelp users... These reviews are insane. Does no one have a discerning palate?? I have eaten sushi hundreds of times in several different states and I feel that 3 stars is fairly generous.  Pros: - friendly service - prices aren't too bad - nope... No more. That's it for the Pros!  Cons: - fish quality is mediocre, at best - they drench most of their rolls in sauce, and the worst part is the sauce is not very viscous, it is watery, so the rice falls apart making eating the piece of sushi cumbersome and annoying. (3 of our 5 rolls were like this) - the water they serve is not filtered, and AZ water sucks something awful. Terrible tasting. Had to order tea to quench my thirst."}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi rolls I've had. Be warned on Fri/Sat night you might wait a bit for a table, and for your food. But it's well worth the wait."}
{"text":"This place has the best sushi in AZ, hands down.  In addition to the normal rolls, House has their specialty rolls, which were amazing.  Everyone that was at the restaurant with me loved their food.  The what the heck roll was so good that I ordered another.  Anyone who wants good sushi - just go to House and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I moved out here from Colorado and finding my sushi spot was getting difficult... Till I found this spot! I enjoyed it. The sushi tasted very good. I had the bonzai roll and it was so delicious! Service was casual and not over powering (which is awesome). I will definitely be coming back here again and again."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a girlfriend, it was fantastic! We shared 3 different rolls, each was so good!  The spicy tuna is spicy and some of the rolls are topped with diced tomato and jalapeño so ask about that if you don't like spicy. I will come back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"After seeing all the good reviews of this place on here, my girlfriend and I decided to give this place a try. She ordered the veggie roll and I tried the What The Heck roll. The presentation was very good and both of our rolls were simply delicious, we'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a great sushi place with a twist, then this is your spot. My friend found HMS on here, and decided to meet with our ladies there for dinner. I'm so glad we did...we had a great experience and left happy, with full stomachs of delicious sushi.  Their menus that had pictures of their special rolls, and a description of each (so we knew what we were getting into). After some vegetable tempura, and garlic-edamame beans, (my friend also had 2 or 3 of his own rolls) we ordered a Hawaiian roll, Mexican roll (nice and spicey, with a jalapeno slice on top) and special Crazy California roll to start off. All were unique and delicious. I've never had anything quite like those rolls, and after eating them left me wanting to try out more of their specialties! We wrapped up with a shrimp roll, which was great as well!   The 2 servers were constantly on top of everything, food, water, checking in, etc. Prices were good...we got a ton of food for $50 for 4 people! It wasn't crazy busy but they had a decent stream of people coming in and out (I can't believe it wasn't more crowded). It was clean, nice, and they had good modern music on overhead. If you're a regular at some of the sushi chains around the valley and want to try something different, go get some decently-priced great sushi! I highly recommended this place. 5 stars all the way, and a high five to the chef!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here twice and we can't wait to go back again soon.  First of all, it's tucked into the AMC theatre plaza, behind the larger restaurants in the area, and I wish they had better signage so they'd get more business.  The restaurant decor is average, nothing fancy (but we've learned that the less expensive decor = way better food, typically).  The wait staff has always been really sweet, and we've never had to,wait for a table or service since we've been two of their four customers both times. Everything we've ordered has been phenomenal, but our favorite so far is the salmon sushi rolls that are cooked, just enough to be slightly crispy.  The veggie rolls are always fresh, with crisp, perfect veggies. The Yaki soba is delicious and not too oily or messy. My husband loves their authentic beer selection. The only thing I'd change is I wish they had a better drink selection. I've ordered water during both visits, wishing they had a decent wine list, but again, for great sushi, I'll do without. Aside from the food, the best thing about this place is the price. With beer and tips, we've never paid more than $25 for dinner. Please support this independent restaurant. They really deserve the business."}
{"text":"Great sushi restaurant! Everything is yummmazing! No need to hesitate stopping in. Thank you to our server, Steve for the great experience! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This place is the best Sushi House in Mesa. I eat here at least once or twice a week. My absolute faves are the Bonsai Roll and What the Heck. The food is amazing and the staff is friendly. It's also nice that it never gets too crowded."}
{"text":"Your attention detail on your sushi is on point! The tiger roll was exceptionally good today. The rolls are always rolled tight and never feel  skimped on the good stuff. some sushi places I've been to the rice to fish ratio is way too much rice but not this place. Also appreciate the balanced flavors and textures . overall yes coming again."}
{"text":"Excellent free standing owner operated restaurant!"}
{"text":"Im from SF so I am picky about sushi qulaity. I must say I really enjoyed the sushi and the service. The owners, recently moved from Las Vegas. This family owned and operated restaurant is very clean, very professional and the qualty is great. I would recommend them and living next to the ocean an in the SF Bay Area I get a lot of great Sushi! So that is saying a lot!"}
{"text":"Went for what I was hoping was going to be great sushi, based on reviews.  Because you never know what you are going to get, we ordered 2 rolls to start.  I was really excited and was fairly disappointed. The rice was DRY. Not kind of dry, but really dry.  LIke it was from earlier in the week dry.  The rolls had good taste to them, had the rice been fresh this probably would have been really good.  After two rolls of incredibly dry rice we choose to go try a different sushi place.  We won't be going back for another try.  It was pricy for what we got."}
{"text":"Fantastic!  Does it bother anyone else that every single time you are chewing on some food the waitress or waiter comes around asking how your food is? So you must either shake head vigorously giving a thumbs up while forcing a smile through shards of broken meat and rice or you can try to talk, while watching food spew out of your mouth like a machine gun in Vietnam? (Just me?) Anyways FEAR NOT that has never happened to me here. Maybe they time it correctly or I am just lucky.   I love taking people here who think they are a sushi \"guru\". Like \"oh ha I eat sushi so much, poop sushi.\" Well BOOM have you ever had a Dynamite Roll? What is in it you may ask. besides awesome fishy fish there is salsa. (WHAT SALSA?) Yes, salsa! It is good trust me. Oh and some Salmon Lover with deep fried salmon and mango sauce? Yes please just take me now! You all just witnessed a foodgasm. A dude foodgasm."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of this restaurant may make you question your decision to eat here because it very obviously used to be a Yoshi's/Kyoto Bowl style place, but I'd encourage you to ignore it.  Lose yourself in the little-too-loud dance music and dig in to the interesting menu.  We got the Salmon Lover, Delish, Eel Cucmber, and Sixty Nine rolls.  All were very enjoyable - they were tasty, had good texture, and were more interesting than the standard sushi restaurant fare.  The Salmon Lover was our favorite - a must try.  Side note:  I'm allergic to avocado, so I usually get nigiri instead of rolls when I try a place for the first time.  The nigiri here was a little on the spendy side and the rolls were so interesting, I asked the waiter if it would be a problem to leave the avocado out.  He was really nice about it and everything came out allergen-free!"}
{"text":"We had the pleasure of coming across this great little tucked away Sushi restaurant two nights ago in the AMC complex. We were so surprised by the excellent service and wonderful Sushi. Everything was fresh, well presented and tasted great! I also had the vegetable tempura which was very good. They have very creative sushi rolls and I can't wait to return and try them all! Another plus is that the bill was very affordable for what we ordered. A must try place!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy eating sushi here, the place is very quaint excellent to bring your special someone my plate today was the Arizona roll with salmon enough to keep the hunger at bay and very delicious. My wife and children also love the place for the great selection of modern sushi. Really hits the spot every time."}
{"text":"OMG - Japanese Lasagna!  We eat here once a week because we love it. Great rolls and fantastic iced tea.  We love the Japanese Lasagna, AZ roll, and Shrimp Lover's rolls. Always friendly and fast.  Never disappointed.  Clean, happy atmosphere with great music.  Love it!"}
{"text":"Very good Sushi. Had the sashimi combo. Fish is fresh and soft.  Like butter! Veggie soba was also very good. Recommend the house edemame as well."}
{"text":"I was really surprised to see that this placed had 4.5 stars, which was why we tried it. The food was not good and the fish did not even seem fresh. I would not recommend this to anyone. Don't be fooled by the reviews."}
{"text":"We love this place!  We've tried different venues and nothing compares thus far.  It is a family owned restaurant - I always support family businesses.  Very nice people...and delicious sushi.  My husband and I always spend at least $70 plus dollars on sushi only here.  Yes, we can eat that much :)  We live down the street from another sushi restaurant here in Tempe but we would rather drive all the way to Gilbert for this place.  If you like tuna get the Tiger roll.  We always get the what the heck and the sixty nine...whatever you get you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place!!!  You must try the What the Heck roll!!  The Udon was also very tasty!!  I never had Tempura Cheesecake before, but, WOW!!!  Server was very personable and attentive!  If I needed to give a con; I wish they had a soda fountain with refills rather than just cans of soda.......but, as far as food, they ROCK!!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi! Very fresh. A wide variety of sushi rolls to choose from. It's in the strip to the left of the AMC theater next to Starbucks. You are missing out on great food if you don't try it."}
{"text":"Stopped here based on other Yelp reviews.  Once again yelp did not let me down.  It is a solid Japanese restaurant.  Two stand outs for me were the Salmon california roll and the Ahi poke."}
{"text":"My bf and I were in town for the weekend and had dinner here last Saturday. The place is small, but WOW is it delicious! I'm almost embarrassed to say we went back three more times before leaving town. The miso soup has a great home made taste, along with the special rolls (lion, amigo, caterpillar, what the heck, and a few more I can't remember :/) even the house salad was amazing. The prices are great, I've paid a lot more for sushi from the big chain sushi restaurants, and in no way do they compare to sushi house."}
{"text":"The Yelp ratings on this restaurant are totally over rated.  We were at this restaurant tonight, Saturday night, and they did not have the fresh oysters or the Hamachi kama they advertise.  They even had them as specials advertised  on there wall.    So I ordered the Hamachi sashimi and it took for ever to get.  When it arrived I knew something was wrong.  First, the sashimi order was suppose to 5 pieces.  This order came with 10 pieces of very thinly sliced Hamachi.  It was still half frozen. Hence the thin slices.   I sent it back asked for the check and left never to return.  Bad choice for sushi."}
{"text":"Small portions compared to the places I tend to frequent. Service was slow (only one server) although he was plenty nice. Food was pretty good but not outstanding. They did have a lot of rolls that you don't tend to see so that was refreshing."}
{"text":"I love House Sushi!! The food is delicious every time I go, and the servers are awesome especially Steve!! Love their yakisoba and tuna sashimi so much!"}
{"text":"Why go to the corporate sushi restaurants for the same old thing? This place takes them by far. Great food and the presentation is amazing. Then you top it off with great service and good prices. Think I found my new sushi restaurant. Oh yea, try the tempura cheesecake."}
{"text":"Best & most affordable sushi in the East Valley.  Love, love, love the Delish and Amigo rolls.  House edamame and the pot-stickers are also two of our faves!  Although they don't have a kids menu we order the chicken satay and a side of white rice for our little ones and they love it.  Super casual, family owned & operated.  It's also fairly small but we've never had to wait for a table.  We've tried several sushi places in the East valley (many of which are much closer to where we live) and so far none of them have impressed us like House!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in Mesa! Great service, consistent quality in food. I always get the Vegas and the bonsai rolls. The house edemame is great with a hint of garlic and salt."}
{"text":"Is was ok. The sushi seems fresh, but we had rolls, not sashimi. The menu doesn't have entree descriptions which is fine, but the wait staff was unaware of of the ingredients as well, so that's frustrating."}
{"text":"Read the reviews and noticed people either loved this place or were not impressed. We were somewhere in between (call it 3 1/3 stars) I was a bit suspicious when I called on a Friday to make a reservation and they sounded surprised I would call. That said, when we walked in, staff were very friendly and engaging. As others have mentioned, you don't see the usual assortment of fresh fish and based on our meal, suspect some of what they serve may have been frozen. To the dishes: - house edemame was hot and tasty with a bit of seasoning - pot stickers were also hot and delicious - then opted for the Bonsai roll and this was a bit \"squishy\" and tasted like maybe the fish was previously frozen - then decided to take a chance on the yellowtail sashimi and it was firmer and seemed like it might have been fresh...was so good we ordered a second - finished with the beef tatami nigiri (yes, an appetizer but figured they would do beef well) and it was somewhat spicy and flavorful It really is all about your expectations when you walk in. Not the best sushi we have had (place in Portland a few weeks ago was outstanding) but it was reasonably priced and certainly not the worst.  I thought it was interesting all the sushi restaurants on Yelp nearby only had 4 stars as well."}
{"text":"So good! We had a reservation but we didn't need one - they seated us quickly and courteously. I had read the Yelp reviews and was determined to try their What the Heck roll, which I ordered along with a Crazy Philadelphia (philadelphia roll that's been deep fried in sauce, I think it was eel sauce) and a regular California roll because I like them. My husband, who is not a fan of sushi, ordered the chicken udon soup and chicken katsu. We also tried flavored sake (apple and peach) and everything was delicious.   Just a warning that I didn't see in other reviews: What the Heck is delicious but it's spicy! It made my nose tingle and got a few sneezes. I'm a little bit of a spice-wimp so it won't be spicy for those who are used to it, but I wasn't expecting spicy. :) It was definitely worth it. So good! My favorite ended up being Crazy Philly, though, and I'm actually kind of drooling a little writing about it."}
{"text":"Second time eating here. The Amigo Roll and Scallop Roll are the best so far. It hasnt been busy either time Ive been here for lunch. The house special rolls are 20% off right now too!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here yesterday with my sister-in-law and her husband and met up with my highschool friend who lives in Chandler.  We picked the place because of the good reviews in Yelp.  True to the reviews, this place was amazing! We ordered What the Heck roll, Amigo roll, Screaming roll, Fantasy roll, Crazy Philly roll and Japanese Lasagna roll.  All of them are delish!!  My faves are the Fantasy, Crazy Philly & Amigo.  My husband who doesn't eat sushi fell in love with What the Heck that we ended up ordering another one. They said it is perfect with their sake bomb.  Service was excellent although the server seems to be having a not-so-good day coz she spilled drinks twice on our table. It was ok coz it was purely accident and she was very attentive.  The place is clean including the restrooms. It is a little pricey and hope they have AYCE.  Will definitely be coming back here for sure."}
{"text":"AMAZING! The place is small but very trendy and cute, and I love their music choice. There was quite a wait for our food, but once it came it was delicious. They so not lie; What the Heck sushi roll is fantastic but also very spicy. We also had their teriyaki chicken entree, they put some seaweed on the rice which looked and tasted great."}
{"text":"Great variety of special rolls Great prices  Very much hole in the wall type of place to enjoy a quiet dinner."}
{"text":"We have a new Sushi spot. Probably the best Sushi I've had in 10 years. I recommend the surf n turf roll!"}
{"text":"We were in the area craving sushi and found this spot, and did we find a gem! You must try the Vampire Rolls, I'd take a picture but its all gone. Great spot for a date and movie. And my better half had the Crispy, Shrimp and Salmon and he loved it. We are defiantly coming back!!!!!"}
{"text":"Worse sushi place I have ever been to. Sorry to say. I won't be back and once we got our plates we regretted going there instantly. Super expensive, not a lot of sushi, plates not inviting. The waitress was picking her nose and seem like she hated her job...with awful service. I will never ever be back. So many other places. Like Sushi San for one. So grossed out."}
{"text":"Service was quick, drink was always kept filled without having to ask.  The fresh wasabi that came with the sashimi is a great plus.  The baked mussel appetizer was very good, it wasn't smothered in faux crab like a lot of other places.  Place that we will definitely be returning to and recommending to others."}
{"text":"This is by far the worse sushi place I have been too. First of all we came here for lunch, and we were the only ones here which should have been a bad sign! First of all our ponytail waiter was awful, seriously bro your job is not that hard to be that bad! Your ice tea tasted like it was fresh last week. Holes in seats, dirty tables, terrible atmosphere It is amazing how this place has so many positive reviews. Do yourself a favor and stay clear."}
{"text":"Do not be fooled by the location next to the AMC- this is authentic and amazing sushi!! We had the Bonzai and Hawaiian rolls- the Bonzai was one of the best rolls I've had in AZ. The sea urchin was a rare treat, although definitely a different texture and experience if you've never had it before. The sashimi and nigiri were generous and high quality cuts. The chirachi bowl is not on the menu but can be ordered and was also good. Fantastic, friendly customer service and super fast service, as well. Next time I'm out in the East Valley, I will stop in for some fish!"}
{"text":"Great rolls!!! Love a good sushi roll that has a little bit of everything. What the heck roll - fabulous! Special Philly roll in tempura (forgot the name... Oops) - mouth-watering. Best of all - great prices... Definitely will be back.... LOTS!"}
{"text":"Sushi was really good with variety of selections. Creative rolls that I didn't have to use the sauce. I ordered 69 rolls, poke tuna, what the heck, salmon wraps, etc. absolutely love all of them! Will come back to try other items on their menu, sure worth 14 miles drive."}
{"text":"Here is one of those times where I just wonder what the heck Yelpers are thinking.  This place is not bad but certainly not deserving to be rated higher than many of the other sushi joints in the area.  First ill start with the fact that there is no sushi bar.  This is a huge deal for me for many reasons primarily because you cannot see the fish and quality prior to ordering.    The rolls were good but a few were mushy including the albacore on one of the rolls that was actually bad.  Ive eaten albacore all my life and this was not right.  The sauces were also very heavy on some of rolls making it impossible to taste the fish itself.    Service was fast but with no personality or friendliness.  Food came quick and well spaced out which is important with sushi.  Good Asian beer list with an average sake list.   I'd have to say that considering the price ill be taking my biz to other joints nearby."}
{"text":"The salmon sashimi is always fresh. The specialty rolls can't be paralleled. I came here almost a year ago with my girlfriend and we've been coming back regularly for the great customer care, peaceful environment and of course...the most incredible sushi ever. The owners are so welcoming every time we come in. They recognize us and know our order before we even speak.   Recommendations: Surf & Turf, What The Heck, Baja, and the the 69 rolls are a few of mine and the ladies favorites."}
{"text":"What should i say... we are from germany, so this kind of sushi is totally new for us, but it was more than impressed. It's delicious, there was no point to say, ok this could be better... it was perfect. We had a nice conversation with the owner, he was totally friendly, very open minded and really hospitable."}
{"text":"Yay! House Modern Sushi was so delicious! We already ate dinner, but just had to come again. Thanks for such an amazing experience! Can't wait to go back again :]"}
{"text":"My second time here.  I visited this spot for lunch on Thursday and loved the Lasagna roll.  Mixed tempura was done nicely with the batter light and crisp.  Kate did mention the cucumbers in the sunomono salad were not crunchy like fresh ones would be.   The polite gentleman server was prompt, courteous and attentive!"}
{"text":"Abandoned by my girlfriend for the evening as she frolicked wantonly in Scottsdale (okay, she went to watch a movie with her parents while I was at work), I struggled to find solace in uncooked fish.  Remembering there was a very highly rated restaurant next to the AMC on the way home, I decided to stop by and see if House was as good as reviewed, or if indeed, Everybody Lies.  Walking in, I was immediately nervous at myself being the lone diner at about 7pm on a Saturday night.  I considered pretending to have an emergency and declaring my girlfriend was going into labor, but I realized that could be a horrible thing to do, and perhaps it would not be good to tempt fate.  Buoyed by my resolve to not inflict copies of myself upon the world, I took in my surroundings, and was bemused by the relatively classy surroundings on my left with sleekly lined contours, contrasted to the relatively campy decor on my right right, with a wall that had a built in wave, and photos of their food with descriptions on colored paper.    Their menu has a nice variety of standard fare across the spectrum of Americanized aps to comfort Japanese food for non-sushi related items, but I was here for the fish!  I ordered an Iced tea along with Red Snapper + Yellowtail Nigiri to start.  Alas, though the fish was fine, the rice was constructed terribly and fell apart when coming into contact with the whisper of soy/wasabi that I attempted to apply.  Applying the mixture to my chopsticks and then unto the nigiri made do, but I couldn't help but be miffed at the reversed process I'm accustomed to.  Explanations of my girlfriend's theoretical triplets entering the world was on the tip of my tongue, but I decided to wait until the Tuna Karai made its appearance before attempting a classy exit.  Fortunately, my canceled deception was rewarded in the form of one of my favorite bites at a Japanese restaurant of all time.  The Tuna Karai was described to me as spicy tuna sashimi.  I feel that calling this spicy was dishonest, as a more accurate description would be that the world was ending early, with the hellfire gathering in my mouth beating the Mayan's predictions by about 9 months.  To save the world I swiftly consumed this dish, being duly grateful for the shaved daikon to nullify some of the heat, with bits of squid to provide some texture against the the yielding tuna.  One of the items on the wall caught my eye, as I can never resist calamari wherever I go. I was grateful they provided me with a half order, as I wanted a bit more sushi.  Their rendition of calamari was wonderfully airy tempura lacking in oiliness, with the accompanying wasabi mayo leaning towards wasabi as the dominant flavor, and the traditional tempura sauce that I preferred, being a well-executed version with a very mild sweetness, light body, yet dense umami flavor reminiscent almost of nuoc cham.  My desire to explore the Modern side of House led me to the Citea roll, humorously named as a tribute to a friend of the server who wanted a roll named after his clothing line.  If his clothing line satisfies me half as much as this roll did, I will drape myself in Citea apparel for a year.  Inside lurked spicy tuna with avocado, while above loomed seared salmon, masago, scallion, and chopped peanuts with eel sauce.  This was a wonderful dance of complementary flavors, while the peanuts and scallions added poignant counterpoints in rougher texture compared to the smoothness of the rest of the roll.  In lieu of desert, I opted for a final set of salmon nigiri.  I had expressed my disappointment of the previous order to my server, and happily I received a more tightly packed nigiri with avocado and lemon garnishes as well.  This was a pair of wonderfully buttery, vibrant bites to end my meal.  With 30% off rolls during traditional Happy Hour times I was also happy with the cost of my meal relative to how much I ate.    As I left, I couldn't help but notice the lines outside the chain restaurants around Stapley and Baseline, and the irritation pushed me to write my first review in months.  This is an excellent family run restaurant with lovely food + service that will provide you with a completely satisfying meal at a good price, and Yelpers should congregate to this location and partake in a  feverish frenzy of foodie bliss!"}
{"text":"Not the best sushi I have ever eatin. One of those things where it was just kinda there. Service is good but no sushi bar which I kinda like. Fish seems fresh but just the run of the mill menu with no flare. Would I come back here again... only if it was convenient but I woukdnt go out of my way. I give it 3 Wasabi's..."}
{"text":"Great little sushi place. Everything was great and the rolls were very original. The Leo roll was great!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here for a noodle fix and some hamachi Kama. I was surprised that it was empty right around 12pm so service was fast. It felt a bit too dark when we walked in, and so we sat by a window and opened the curtain for some rays of sunshine. Much better! People started trickling in by about 1pm or so. The shrimp tempura udon $8.50 was deliciously presented and filled my noodle fix. It's thick udon noodles, shiitake mushrooms, fried bits of onions, sliced onions, carrots, sprinkled dried seaweed, 2 pieces of shrimp tempura and a soy sauce based soup. The hamachi kama appetizer just came with thin sliced lemons and sauce. Their appetizer portion is a lot smaller than a couple other places that I've ordered at. Service was on par and eatery was right up my alley."}
{"text":"We've been here a couple of times. Food is not bad but definitely overpriced for the quality of the food and general experience. Service has been slow both times. Our rolls fell apart when trying to eat and I have a thing about restaurants bringing out a can of soda when you order a soft drink."}
{"text":"These guys deliver every. Single. Time. Whether it's a one-of-a-kind & completely house-made specialty roll, or one of the salads or plain sashimi, these guys deliver. Yes, the location is a bit odd (N of the movie theatre off the SE corner of Stapley & the 60) but the parking is ample & the food is amazing.  This family owned restaurant boasts the best sauces, flavor pairings & overall creative/flavorful rolls you could ask for. I'm a fan for life & come here as frequently as possible. Keep up the amazing work! :)"}
{"text":"The most authentic sushi place. Everything is made fresh. The owners are an amazing older couple and it's family run. Great place."}
{"text":"My friend took me here for the first time today, and I have to say, I'm really impressed. I've lived in various Asian countries, and truly know what is and isn't authentic cuisine, and House Modern Sushi is certified exquisite! From top to bottom, this place feels like a sushi house you'd find tucked away in a small side street of Tokyo. I highly recommend HMSR if you're picky about Asian food as I am. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Hey Rudy L. Take you snobby sushi eating attitude somewhere else. So what it used to be a l&l and has no bar doesn't mean the food isn't good. FYI you need to reread your review before you actually save it.   I've been to literally 20-30 sushi places around the valley some gross and some awesome and this place is close to awesome. Yes it's family owned and the daughter with a huge bun on top of her head is the waitress and the son and father make the sushi. But most of the time mom and pop shops are the best but in this case the son is the owner.   My favorite things to order are Tuna Karai, Arizona roll and surf and turf. the tuna Karai is a tuna salad with octopus and it's spicy but sooooo damn good. Sometimes I'll order 2 orders with some rice and make that as my meal.   I've had a lot of other rolls to with friends and they are great. The big thing for me is presentation and the sushi looks great. Doesn't look sloppy, no big and small pieces, rice is tight and intact. The fish taste and smells very fresh.   They also have Korean tea. Which is basically barley tea it's very good, ask for it cold.   Anytime I'm in the area I try to stop by and get my tuna Karai fix. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because they don't serve alcohol yet.   Keyword is \"yet\" I talk to the owner Steve a lot when I'm there and he's already in the process of getting his liquor license which should be approved by may. Nothing like have some sushi and washing it down with some saki bombers."}
{"text":"really good rolls and a few veg. options. Try the tempura ice cream its great."}
{"text":"This place has amazing service and sushi! I highly recommend giving them a try! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Loved eveything I got.  What the Heck Roll, Crazy Philly, and Amigo roll so delish.  Worth coming back because so flavorful and affordable."}
{"text":"First time here and only stopped because we were in the area.  Good Sushi but portions are small.  Shrimp lover roll seemed like the only roll we got that was of normal portion.  I wish they put their specials on the menu or create a separate menu with specials rather than put them on small pieces of paper on a cork board near bar area.  All in all, this place was decent but not sure we will be back."}
{"text":"As L&L's closed down, this sushi restaurant replaced it.. my curiosity slowly drew me inside. I've been waiting for a good sushi place to open up in Gilbert!  Some of the owners were sitting outside and asked me if I was Japanese, \"No\" I told them, but I wished I was since that would make an interesting conversation since it seemed like it was a small Japanese family-ran business. I quickly looked over their menu and ordered to go, sadly, they did not have the Asian Skirt Steak, so I ordered Chicken Teriyaki for myself and Pork Katsu for my better half. With 2 orders of California rolls as well (8 pieces per order-not bad!)  After we paid, we left for a bit since kiddo started getting antsy, when we came back everything was ready to go, in about 15 minutes. As we left, all the family members thanked us  and waved good-bye. Wow, I haven't seen that in a looonggg time. It's nice to see people still appreciate your business these days. As I open our food at home, there is a bonus box of gyozas that they packed in there for us with a big smiley face on it. Whoo too!!   I don't mean to sound like a damn ad- but you can tell they pride in presentation. The rolls were incredibly clean and sitting on a beautiful, green leaf with ginger and wasabi. NICE. Someone takes pride in their work. I can't find anything to complain, the staff is awesome, the food is great and the price is decent. Easy 5/5.  P.S. Please remove the L&L neon sign above the restaurant, it confuses people."}
{"text":"The spicy is very spicy, just the way we love it! The Mexican roll rocks!!"}
{"text":"I love coming here. Every time I come, I get great service and the food tastes good. The sushi is good and they can make things if you don't see it on the menu. The last time I went I got tuna poke with sushi rice and it was really good. I would highly recommend it. My family got some udon and sushi and that tasted good too. I would recommend this place to other people."}
{"text":"The absolute best sushi I have had in a very long time! The sushi chef is amazing and the sushi is excellently made and tastes just as good as the presentation shows!! This place is second to none."}
{"text":"Service is friendly although not too fast. \"House edemame\" comes doused in garlic salt - if you like that sort of thing. Gyoza was awesome and the rolls were good. Somewhat overpriced though."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch on a Sunday. Quiet little joint, great service, nice atmosphere. The kake (vegtable) udon was so yummy! Buttery noodles, hot broth and BIG mushrooms! Philly, Hawaiian, and miso were also very good! We will be back!"}
{"text":"So yummy!! This is one of the best sushi places we have been to. The family that owns this place is super nice.  Love going here."}
{"text":"Been here three times and i come here from OUT OF STATE! Its a must for sushi lovers!  Order the Arizona! Love it  Fantastic Appetizers, great Tempura, fresh house salads! They have teriyaki, soups, yaki udon, yakisoba (stir-fry), and delectable House Specials!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp, saw good reviews and decided to try it out. It did not disappoint, pretty tasty!   Ambiance is lacking and the staff could be more customer service orientated. The prices are average but the Sushi menu is large so lots of options!   Overall, I had a good experience and left happy."}
{"text":"We found this restaurant through Yelp & it had a good rating but mixed reviews, so we ventured there with no expectations... WE WERE PLEASANTLY SATISFIED! The Jalapeno Poppers with crab were some of the best poppers I've EVER had... they are a must try! There weren't many patrons, at one point we were the only ones there at about 5pm on a Friday evening, that could have been a concern being a Sushi place, but the food/fish was fresh & DELICIOUS. We have it on our list of must go again. The service was excellent! Thank you! (They are currently offering 20% off all day Happy Hour on Sushi ROLLS only)"}
{"text":"Wonderful place.  Inventive and interesting menu.  Fish was fresh and delicious.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Small intimate and casual atmosphere. Friendly staff. The special rolls menu had a lot of items I've never seen. Quality of food was very good and sashimi was nice sized pieces. Overall, we enjoyed the dining experience here."}
{"text":"Went here for a family dinner. I originally stumbled onto this right at the grand opening but feel as if the quality has dropped dramatically. The rolls are small and  shriveled, the quality of the fish is mediocre, not fresh but not fishy either. The family owners are great but I just can't lead people to believe that this is the best sushi in the area. There are places that offer full healthy rolls that forte fresh fish instead of added fillers and fancy sauces littering the top."}
{"text":"I have to warn others of this restaurant! I don't get how they receive 4 stars and believe I am fooled! We arrived at 6ish- when open the door, we didn't feel ac at all- the inside is about 80 something degrees. It's hot, but ok. There were three four tables with customers while all the other tables had used dirty dishes uncleaned. A guy came greeting us n cleaned one table for us so we can sit down ( funny he didn't clean other tables until the next set of customers come it). It took him 10 to take our orders. And took them a while to make our orders apparently.The tempura shrimp appetizer was pathetic- the shrimps were thinner than my finger (and I am a girl who is normal size). The chicken katsu dinner was small and plain- there's no miso soup, no side dishes, no California roll, no salad like you would get in any other Japanese restaurant- just a bowl of white rice and katsu. We waited another 10 mins to receive our sushi rolls- man it is roll fish with rice how could you take so long? The sushi was mediocre- you can get better one even in costco's pre-made sushi... Overall it is not a happy dinning experience. We didn't enjoy the dinning environment ( hot and dirty), service was poor while food was just ok. So please, don't waste your money and time, find other place!"}
{"text":"I am a sushi fanatic. i think its definitely one of the finer things in life and with that said, i must admit that i have been disappointed over and over again by the quality of sushi in arizona. I've tried multiple sushi restaurants in the gilbert/chandler area and i am very sick of seeing variations of deepfried and/or oversauced, spicy tuna/cali rolls.   My friend and i missed our showing at the AMC and so we decided to grab a bite at House sushi and check out what the fuss what all about. and let me tell you, we definitely grabbed more than a bite. Everything was just amazing and more importantly, ORIGINAL! We started with the \"Yellowtail Lover\" and \"The Screaming O\" that our lovely server Diana reccomended us. The yellowtail practically melted in my mouth and mixed so well with the scallion tempura! The Screaming O was a specialty sashimi rather traditional sashimi because it was covered with their secret sauce that is to DIE FOR. There is nothing typical about this sushi restaurant. Everything from the lemon peppered edemame to the tempura ice cream were just superb!   The service was excellent and the owner, Steve, even came out to greet us. He explained to us how they pride themselves on freshness and how making sushi is an art.. and i could definitely taste and see what he was talking about. The bill matched the average of any other sushi restaurant in the area but the food was just so much more enjoyable. I will DEFINITELY be back here soon. If you consider yourself a man with standards for real sushi then the least you can do is give this place a try."}
{"text":"My friends always invite me to go here all the time but unfortunately I flaked 100% for the past 2 years. I finally went and I realized that I didn't live to far from it. The menu is pretty simple, But has a lot to offer. I got the what the heck roll and I'll be honest I had some skepticism, but once it was served it looked really, really good. It was piled high with bell peppers,onion, and jalapeño. Like literally what the heck, it was really good. I'll probably want to go back since it's close to me and definitely want to try other rolls!"}
{"text":"Great sushi.  Friendly service.  A good mom and pop operation. The bonsai roll was delicious.   One of the better sushi places and great prices too."}
{"text":"Outstanding fish. On the more expensive side. Small menu. Good for happy hour but portion is a bit unsubstantial for a meal. Owners are Japanese. I stand by the quality of its food."}
{"text":"Love this place! We went on a Friday night at 6:30 and got right in! The service and sushi were on point.  I got the Mexican roll and it was delish. We will be returning!"}
{"text":"Great local sushi and tempura, we loved the chicken yakisoba. Portions are nice for sharing and prices are wallet friendly! Great for a quick bite or pre movie meal."}
{"text":"We love the freshness of the sushi. We always get the Arizona, the Mexican, the Fantasy, and salmon shashimi."}
{"text":"The udon is delicious! We came here on a whim and it definitely lived up to all the reviews!"}
{"text":"I like to try out of the box sushi restaurants that don't stuff most of their rolls with \"crab mix\" so;  I  searched and searched for some different in Mesa. I was leaving doctor's appointment and needed some good sushi. I walked into House Modern Sushi and got my pick of clean tables. My guest and I took seat at booth and were quickly greeted with drinks. I ordered iced green tea which was very refreshing! Quick survey of the menu I knew I found my new new sushi spot when I am on this side of town.   A few things I look for when I picking a sushi spot.  A) reasonable price  B) sushi rows that good variety of fish  C) wide selection of sushi rows to pick   House of Modern Sushi checked all these boxes! We ordered four rows that were delivered right away and we ate them right away. The staff at the restaurant was very nice and checked on us multiple times in the visit with refills to our drinks. The restaurant was not busy during my visit but's close to strip mall so I could see how that could change with later times of day. I would strongly recommend you check House of Modern Sushi."}
{"text":"We decided to stop by this place because we felt like continuing our sushi quest yesterday, it was close, and it has good reviews.  I wasn't expecting a whole lot, however, since it was the East Valley, and the first thing I noticed was the lack of an actual sushi bar and visible sushi chefs.  Plus, there was techno music playing.  I HATE when they do that.  Sorry, but I want an authentic experience, complete with Japanese dudes chopping up my fish in plain sight, and 15th century Japanese music with pan flutes and hand drums or whatever they use.  A samurai trained in the bushido tradition standing by the door in order to slice up unruly guests would also be a nice touch, but I'll give them a pass on that one.  Anyways, we sat down at the table, and started with the miso soup.  This was some of the strongest miso I've had.  It was almost like they were trying too hard.  So, I wasn't real hopeful, although they had some nice cuts of fish on the menu... Halibut, toro, uni, etc... Nothing crazy, but still some good stuff.  Unfortunately, they were out of all the interesting stuff.  The live specials were only available on weekends, and by Monday, they were all out.  Cool that they have them, but unfortunate that we couldn't actually try them.  I also wanted to try the beef tataki sashimi style, but for some reason, it was only available in nigiri.  Why?  You can put a strip of seared beef over rice, but you can't serve them alone?  This did not make sense to me.  We ordered a couple of the special sashimi items - some hamachi dish whose name I don't recall, and the Screaming \"O\" - as well as white tuna sashimi, albacore sushi, red snapper sushi, surf clam sushi, and the Sixty Nine Roll.  The hamachi was overly stepped in citrus.  I mean, it was so citrusy that you were basically eating lemons with the texture of raw fish.  I'm the kind of guy who likes to taste fish when he eats fish.  The Screaming \"O\" was pretty good, despite its overpowering spice and marinade.  Also masked the tuna flavor, but it was a seared dish, so it wasn't as bad.  It would have been better had they dialed it down a notch, but it was still tasty.  The sushi and sashimi was typical.  Basically what you'd expect from a standard sushi place.  Sixty Nine Roll was pretty good.  It is basically softshelled crab and shrimp tempura on the inside and fish (I believe it was the standard tuna, yellowtail, and salmon) on the outside.  Good filler to finish off the meal.  Finally, we ended with some tempura ice cream and tempura cheesecake for dessert.  The cheesecake was nice and thick, but also pretty much frozen and impossible to cut with a spoon.  The tempura batter was all wrong; it was thick and crunchy, not light and flaky like tempura is supposed to be.  At the end of the day, I decided that this place is good for what it tries to be.  Its appeal is not for those who love sushi.  It's sushi for people who probably like to eat at Chipotle, Zupas, or whatever the newest trendy chain place is, but every now and then want to eat some raw fish.  It has enough to perhaps expand the horizons for those who don't often eat sushi, but not much that will interest those who like a new adventure every meal."}
{"text":"Potstickers were very salty, ice tea was served in thick plastic glasses, udon seafood soup had very little seafood. Seating area alongside the wall has cracked dingy looking cover which should have been replaced a while ago. Their special rolls are too pricey for the amount of fish they have in them. Service was OK. I will not return and I do not see how any sushi lover can rate this place high. I am giving 3 stars hoping they can improve and recover when in reality I feel it was 2 star dining experience."}
{"text":"We ordered three rolls. There as the rainbow roll, surf and turf roll and lobster roll. All three were so delicious. It's rare to find beef in a roll so I knew I had to order it. Surprisingly it was really tender and scrumptious. The bill came out to about $30 without tip thanks to the all day 30% off sushi happy hour. Now only if I can find a good Mexican spot!"}
{"text":"Excellent dinner of many new-to-me choices. Beef nigiri was delicious, little hard to chew but very tasty. Gyoza was great! Love that it's crispy fried. The yakisoba was phenomenal to round out dinner. At the waitress's suggestion I tried the red bean and green tea mochi which were both outstanding. No pictures because it was too delicious to wait!!"}
{"text":"I'm on a pretty limited diet plan and I don't eat dairy, sugar or fried foods. That is why I enjoy eating sushi. But at this restaurant don't expect to find a lot of choices if you don't like cream cheese or deep fried foods. I found about a handful of rolls that met my dietary criteria and they were ok - nothing to write home about. Service was good. It's an all right place but not one that I would go out of my way to visit."}
{"text":"Came by for some hand crafted rolls that are tasty and beautiful to look at.  A great place for smaller groups for either lunch or dinner.  Def a great place to eat in the Valley."}
{"text":"Came here today and was told there was no more happy hour sushi Monday through Thursday?? When did they take this away? Our server said she'd never heard of it?"}
{"text":"This place is NO freakin joke. I had one of the funnest tuna dishes ever. I can't remember the name but it wasn't Tuna Poke, because I told the waitress that I wanted that but something spicier and she recommended the dish just below it. HOLY COW. SPICY!!! And delicious. My mouth was on fire and my heart was warmed. Who knew such a dorky facade would house (no pun intended) such a gem. Please go here, immediately. I would recommend this to anyone near and dear to me. Kids got chicken katsu and enjoyed it. Service was quick and responsive. It wasn't too busy so I'm hoping and praying it was just the odd time we went and that they will THRIVE.  Oh, I'm going to have a hard time not going back too often. Sushi, my love, please wait for me. And wait for me at House Modern Sushi.  Oh, and mochi ice cream, strawberry, sent me over the edge of full and happy."}
{"text":"We were going to the movies today and did a Yelp search for resturants. This place was at the top of the list and for good reason. Its fantasitc!   Apon entering i was taken by the great decor and cleaness. We ordered Spicy Edemime and Potstickers to start off. Then i got the Arizona Sushi Roll and my wife got a noodle dish.   We will back! Loved it."}
{"text":"We went on Sunday around 6 pm and was not busy at all. The service was a little slow but well worth the wait! We were a party of 6 and ordered soo many rolls that I don't even remember what they were but were ALL very very good, we also ordered 2 sides of chicken terayaki and the baked oysters, our total was 120.00 not bad I'd say. I can truly say I've found my new sushi restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"Well we've gone bk at least 6+ times and the quality is still very good.  Service is great. I still love the screaming roll. A mix of spice n citrus ;))) The uni was very fresh and the soft shell crab is crunchy n tasty."}
{"text":"This place is lovely. It's a small place with that Mom and Pop feel to it. The staff is nice and friendly. They have great presentation of their food. Sometimes the wait can be a little bit for your food as I do not think they have many chefs. They do not make the sushi at a sushi bar, instead it's all made in the kitchen. If you have any problems with spicy foods, let them know and be sure to check there isn't any hidden spice in a sauce or such of your rolls. They are great about accommodating your needs. The food is delicious and I will certainly return."}
{"text":"I have ate here so often and the food is amazing love their rolls their deep fried tofu and rice the only complaint is I always feel like I am bothering them or I'm being judged..."}
{"text":"The best sushi in east valley. Vegas, Fantasy and Shrimp Lover are my favorite!"}
{"text":"We had a restaurant.com coupon.  They also have happy hour specials on appetizers.  You cannot combine specials with the coupon.  We started with edamame and mussels.  I have never had mussels before, just oysters and clams.  The mussels were eff'in awesome.  They were not super chewy and the way they were seasoned and served, spicy and bold, was seriously amazing.  Three of us polished off three different rolls.  Spicy tuna crunch roll, over the top.  What the heck roll, another spicy roll that was seriously good as HLL!  Screaming roll, spicy tempura style shrimp roll with a delicious crunch.  Spicy is the way to go with sushi rolls.  For dessert we went with mochi ice cream, served in four flavors: vanilla, strawberry, green tea and mango.  The green tea and mango were my favorites.  Such a good dinner, now if only they served alcohol."}
{"text":"Came in for there lunch specials but after seeing there specialty rolls, had to have one. Got the What The Heck and glad I did. Everything was amazing!!  Don't forget to order the Tempura Ice Cream for dessert!  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is a great family owned sushi place. It's reasonably priced and the sushi is delicious. They have their own unique rolls.  I've tried almost every roll on the menu, and so far I love it. If you enjoy sushi, come and try it out. They're great for lunch."}
{"text":"Definitely recommend the \"what the heck\" rolls. I also liked how they serve a hot small sake with any large bottled beer for $1 more. Very authentic sushi if you're into it! I will be coming back."}
{"text":"House is our go to place for sushi for lunch during the week for my coworkers and I. They have a lot of different rolls and I've never tried one I didn't love. Prices are a little high and I wish they offered a happy hour pricing at some point during the day but besides that I wouldn't change a thing."}
{"text":"Fresh sushi rolls and sashimi. Chicken yakitori was all right."}
{"text":"Really good sushi place many unique rolls. Came here because of the rating on yelp and really enjoyed it. I got the \"what the heck\" roll and it was really good, my only complaint was there was a little too much chopped up peppers and onions on top. My friend for the \"cita\" roll, and she really liked the smokey flavor of the roll. The service was really friendly and super fast! Also- if you are a tea drinker their tropical unsweetened ice tea was extremely refreshing. Just a tip it may looked closed from the outside because of the shades but they do that to keep it cool inside. I would recommend, and I am sure I will be back!"}
{"text":"We are regulars here, for not only the decent prices but their tasty, fresh fare. The sushi/sashimi is particularly tasty and fresh. Lots of variety in the menu, from creative sushi rolls to other traditional Japanese fare, such as udon or tonkatsu. A great Mom n Pop establishment!"}
{"text":"Keep In mind I only had one item, but it was really good. Fresh, great presentation, friendly waiter.  My \"What the Heck\" roll came to $11.89 with tax after a 20% discount. Im told its a family run business which are the kind of restaurants I like to find."}
{"text":"So my co-worker and I just had dinner at this place and I have to tell you it was great.   We had Sushi at Kona Grill and it cost to much and it was substandard at best.  If you're ever in Mesa, AZ and looking for a place for great sushi this is the place to go.  I promise you won't be disappointed?"}
{"text":"Also they have happy hour Mon-Thurs! 30%off all sushi items and its BYO! :)"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying, this place has no sushi bar! Why didn't someone's review say that? To me, sushi is a experience, I love watching and interacting with my chef. The sushi wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either.Price was also on the high side. Was very disappointed. Just seemed like mall sushi."}
{"text":"This is my all time favorite sushi spot! Today is cold so I'm getting yakisoba! So good!"}
{"text":"I just tried two of their lunch specials($7.50). These rolls are extremely bad. A tiny piece of fish in the very middle of rice roll. Think it as a rice roll more likely. very disappointed. What a waste of money. Will never go back."}
{"text":"First time. Was in the area and this place had good reviews. I am not disappointed.  The salmon was delicious.  The 69 roll was very good.  The salmon lover roll is to die for.  Order it."}
{"text":"Small place and hardly anyone eating there when we came on a Sunday night.  Friendly server and the food came quickly.  Everything we ordered was delicious!  Maybe a little overpriced but I certainly can't complain about the quality and freshness of the salad and sushi.  My husband also ordered a chicken udon stir fry plate which was huge and the sauce they used was amazing!  It wasn't overly sauced either.    We did have a little trouble finding this place because the sign was not lighted initially even though it was dark outside.  It would also be nice if there was some kind of AYCE option or happy hour."}
{"text":"Always delicious.  Poke was on point.  Service was fast and the prices are righteous."}
{"text":"Loved it! Affordable and high quality sushi!"}
{"text":"Thee best sushi in town!!! My cousin and I stop by this place at least once a week, sometimes even more. I got her hooked on sushi by taking her to this place! My favorite rolls to get are the shrimp lover's, caterpillar, and dragon roll. The shrimp lover's has an amazing wasabi mayo sauce on it, and even if you don't like wasabi (like myself) or you're not a fan of spicy food, you'll LOVE it. It also has shrimp tempura sticking out of both ends and avocado and shrimp slices on top. The dragon roll has eel and avocado on top, and eel and crab inside and it's doused with eel sauce. They also put a unique spin on the caterpillar roll by frying the eel is tempura so it has a refreshing crunchy texture unlike other caterpillar rolls I've had in the past. The dynamite roll is just California rolls topped with sauteed mushrooms, scallops, shrimp, onions, carrots, and scallions, kind of disappointing because it was not what I was expecting but still really good, nonetheless. I've also gotten the shrimp tempura appetizer and seaweed salad which are both great. The prices are also very fair, as well. I think that you get way more than what you paid for."}
{"text":"This place needs more reviews and more customers! The best sushi I've had in a long time. Located in a shopping center with the AMC theatres and other shops, it's a great place to go for lunch or dinner after a movie or a shopping trip.  We got the calamari to start, and though it wasn't the best i've had, it was good. I still prefer the calamari made from the steaks as opposed to the rings, but the breading was nice and crispy. But the rolls.... Oh my god, the rolls! We got the What The Heck, the Hot Night and the 69. Our favourite was by far the What The Heck, but the Hot Night followed a close second. The 69 was alright, and the sashimi on top was fresh and tasty, but the sauce wasn't the greatest. It made the roll a little too salty. But it was still really good. Both the What the Heck and the Hot Night were spicy, so if you like your sushi with a little kick, try those! The pico de gallo on top of the What The Heck added a great crunch and a unique twist.   The service was fast and friendly, and we got 30% off our order for happy hour. Interestingly enough, while we were sitting there, at least 4 people came in looking for the Hawaiian BBQ that used to be there. In my opinion, they should have stayed and tried the sushi. They wouldn't have been disappointed. We will definitely be back; there are a bunch of rolls we want to try! Yelpers, if you go, get on Yelp and share your experience! They deserve the business. It's about time the east side had a REALLY good sushi joint."}
{"text":"This place offers great happy hour discounts and the rolls, as the other reviews state, are fresh, well made and most importantly delicious! I know some people like to go for the 'cheapest' most basic rolls for sushi like spicy tuna/california, but I would highly recommend their specialty rolls (What the Heck is my fav) as they are really creative/unique, and very, very tasty. It's definitely worth stopping by if you are close by if you are a fan of good sushi. Fantastic customer service too!"}
{"text":"The sushi was very delicious, and fresh, the udon stir fry was bland.  It's a small little restaurant in a strip mall.  The seats could use some updating as they are cracked and pieced together with duct tape. Service was about the only negative thing, the waitress was attentive but perhaps to much.  There were about 4 other tables there, so it was totally packed, she brought us drinks and the our order came out pretty quickly, however she came and took things from table a little to quick and would reach across the table and get a little to close for comfort. I also found them to be a tad pricey, no specials or happy hour, paid $75 for a table of 3 with no alcohol, could have gone to a higher end place and gotten more."}
{"text":"Strange Love, strange highs and strange lows Strange Love, that's how my love goes (Depeche Mode)  However, you won't give me pain!   Strange, this place was located in a strip mall area next to a Starbucks and theater.  I look at this from a positive standpoint because of the high traffic.  Sushi, coffee, and then a movie!  They had a great looking website, but that generally doesn't tell the story.  Strange, ingredients on the menu. Geoduck, giant clams, and round clams, not my typical dinner cravings, but let's just say I'm not too shy to try. I don't have a PhD yet (Doctorate in Phood!), but I was impressed.  My two dinner associates are quite knowledgeable about their sushi and they help educate me in that field. Round Clam 3 different ways they rave - Nigiri, Sashimi and Fried -- Ding & Wink!  I dig their Geoduck since its such a rare item to eat fresh and uncooked!  However, being non-sushi connoisseur; my favorite - the salmon wrapped avocado; which you can see on Yelp Photos.  Strange? No, it's not so strange after all. It's definitely worth a try and totally recommend HMS - stop by and say hi to Steve he's a cool fish :) - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Wow! For a small little place, tucked in the corner of a shopping center, you would never know by the outside that this place has some amazing food! We were seated immediately and our food was out with very little wait time. It all had a wonderful, fresh flavor. We had edamame and baked green lip mussels for a starter, 2 rolls (caterpillar and citea) a side of white rice, and two drinks- all for less than $40. Most definitely on the will be back list!"}
{"text":"The sushi is very good here. It tastes fresh and doesn't disappoint. Pricing is reasonable, and they give you a pretty good amount of food. Shrimp lover is super good! Especially with eel sauce! I would definitely recommend! It's close to the amc theaters and is a great place to come in and unwind. The layout inside is simple but simple by amazing food is fine by me!"}
{"text":"I don't know how to cook but here's a recipe to keep me from coming back. Put a petite brunette leaning on the front counter at 3:50 on 1/21/17. Have her stare at you, not saying anything so I have to ask if she works there. And definitely don't smile. Just want a sake so turn around, say nothing. I'll find a seat. And when she brings it, still don't say anything. Now, I realize people have bad days and bad things happen to them. Who knows what happened to her today? So I ask \"How's your day been?\" Shrug your shoulders and walk away. One thing I enjoy about sushi places is the enthusiasm and engagement with the customers. This place has none. They may have the greatest sushi on earth, but I'll never know  Because the first impression lasts the longest."}
{"text":"Great food and service. I typically go to RA next to my work and this places is leaps and bounds better.   I loved the Dragon and Vegas rolls.  The tempura ice cream was also very good.  The fish was all fresh and had great flavor, the service was great.   The atmosphere was that of a small joint and I could see it getting crowded depending on the day. I personally would wait in line to get in. I did not sample any of the drinks so I cannot speak for those.  I will be giving these guys all of my \"Sushi\" business going forward.  I should note that this place is 7 miles from me and I'm closer to Kona Grill."}
{"text":"Well. The sake was good.... that is the best I can say. Not sure if they changed owners but I came because they used to have great reviews. The server was sweet but sushi was really boring. Almost all of it was fried."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Mesa! I been here twice and I have no complaints. The rolls are unique. I'll be back sooner than later :)."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here and it was really good.  Tried a couple of new dishes and loved them.  We were the only 2 in the whole place, which is a bit sad.  Hope they survive as the food is well worth it."}
{"text":"I don't know why do I chose this place, but I'm sure I won't be back. Only ordered one poki tuna salad for lunch, they charged 20 bucks, including 1.75 for a small bowl of rice. This is ridiculous...  Back to the dish itself, the tuna is not fresh at all, the texture is so soft and inconsistent. The whole dish is just tuna with sesame and sesame oil, and it's very salty that I do not even put the soy sauce. As far as I know, seaweed is the major portion for the poki style, but instead, they put a lot green onion mixed with the seaweed, and they cut them to the similar size that you cannot tell how much seaweed and green onion they actually mixed with."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Phoenix and you would totally miss it if you weren't looking. Extremely creative rolls and fantastic quality sashimi. We WILL be back!"}
{"text":"Very good! Best gyoza I've ever had...super crispy and steaming hot. We got our usual crispy california roll, and tried the Citea, which was okay (tasted good, but I like more crunch to my sushi and it didn't have cucumber in it). But we're definitely going to go back and try some other ones, the menu had some really cool looking rolls we want to try!"}
{"text":"I went in craving noodles and ended up ordering the soba.  It had good flavor, the portion was a good size, but the chicken was incredibly fatty.   I would go back again, but I think I will try some of the other places close by first."}
{"text":"This may be my new favorite.  Sushi crab shack changed their menu and although I came in a wheelchair they asked me if I could go up stairs. This place had great service. Everything we ordered was perfectly prepared.  My oldest granddaughter wanted to go back the next day!  She did talk us into going a week later and we had the same perfect experience.  We will be back."}
{"text":"The place looks like a fast food joint, but it is not.  They are a sit down service.  Cool!  We had a party of 20ppl.  We filled up half the place.  They have tons of choices of sushi and regular COOKED food.  I ordered the:  1.  Agedashi Tofu - Perfectly and lighted fried tofu with soy sauce:  YUM GOOD 2.  Gyoza - Fried and they are ok 3.  Teriyaki Chicken - The sauce was not too sweet - Not bad  The service was pretty good to keep up with 20 of us!"}
{"text":"Very nice time.  Loved the lunch specials, good service, very clean.  Chu did a good job serving.  Loved the Hawaiian Roll, surf and turf was good too.  I would ask for the rind of the cucumber to be peeled next time, but overall a great sushi dine.  I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"This place is family owned and operated. Steve and his sister are awesome! Everyone is so friendly. They have a large selection of sushi. If you need to substitute a ingredient they are willing to do that too. I do not eat sushi but they have other items on their menu. I had the chicken teriyaki dish. It was delicious. The chicken was very tender and the sauce was delicious.   This place is small but elegant.  They also offer take out!"}
{"text":"I've been around. No, not like that. I've been around a lot of sushi joints. This place is the best in Arizona, out of the 15 restaurants I've had. My girlfriend and I shared our first meal here and it was so good I got laid that night. This is fine sushi and it is always on point. We come here at least a couple times a month. In the name of our lord and savior, even Jesus Christ, amen."}
{"text":"These guys have great sushi. Sushi lovers in first time sushi diners both have great options. The service is sometimes a little bit slow, hence the four stars."}
{"text":"Great family restaurant. Ask them, they will go out of their way to serve you a special meal for your celebration ( I have had the best mother's day meals here) or tell you what has arrived fresh. The salmon is amazing. I am a sushi traditionalist (married to a Japanese guy) so I haven't tried all the sauces or \"modern\" rolls. I have tried most all of the menu items and I love their version of Yakisoba. Usually picky eaters, my teens are adventurous here and they usually eat the udon seafood soup (made with whatever is in fresh, including octopus etc.). Of course the kids always have to get their ice cream mochi treats."}
{"text":"I have to say that I was pretty underwhelmed by the whole meal here.  We started out with the cucumber sonumono.  It wasn't at all vinegary and didn't have that bite that I usually love in a cucumber salad.  We ordered the What the Heck roll, the Arizona roll, and the Philly roll.  The Arizona roll was really small and it was basically a Califonia roll with a jalapeno on top.  The What the Heck roll was much bigger and was by far the best roll of the three, but it still wasn't memorable.  I really had high hopes for this place since it is pretty close to where we live, but it just didn't live up to those expectations.  Maybe we would have had better luck with non-sushi/roll items on the menu."}
{"text":"I came in here because I had seen how amazing all the Yelp reviews were, and now I am completely baffled. The best single word to describe this place is \"Forgettable\". The spicy tuna roll was so incredibly spicy (even for a native Arizonan) that I didn't even finish it, which has never happened to me with any meal in my life. The fish that was served was of a slimy consistency. The scallop roll was edible, but nothing to write home about. Every roll I ordered fell apart, usually before I had even touched it. The amount of 5 star reviews absolutely blows my mind. I will continue to take my business to the other end of the parking lot."}
{"text":"We are new in town and wanted Japanese food that is not far from our house. Decided to give this a try and thought it was great. Mostly rolls on the menu but the ones we got with raw fish the fish was fresh. Will be back again."}
{"text":"Bomb ass food, great atmosphere, friendly staff.   Best sashimi I've had on this side of town, complete with awesome prices, and smiling staff.   What more could you ask for??"}
{"text":"Everyone who rated this 5 or 4 star has never had real sushi. The service alone wouldn't merit 4 stars. The fish is flavorless and masked with seasoning and vinagerette soaked rice. The menus are homemade laminated and worn; I had difficulty reading the menu in low lighting. They started to sweep the floors and clean up an hour and a half before closing. Like thanks for ruing our date night. Should we order the food to go since you guys want to leave??? The waiter was the same person cleaning and when he brought us our rolls he slide them on the table in a hurry and walked away. Sorry to inconvenience you bro...next time I won't spend my money at your establishment. Terrible personality for the restaurant industry. We will never return. The one star is mainly for the quality of their sushi. Absolute trash"}
{"text":"I have already left a positive review a while back. I just wanted to say I have been back about 8 more times since and still love it. They are very consistent and the food is always perfection!I can't believe I once thought RA was amazing, what a joke!  If you are looking for the best Sushi in AZ this is the spot!!"}
{"text":"Yum!! Leaving happy with a full stomach. Salmon wrap was DELISH. Never had anything like that before, and it was better than sashimi. Tuna poke salad was near perfection, and I say \"near\" because I think it would taste better with a side of rice. It had too much flavor to be served over a bed of that white crunchy radishy stuff that's usually used as garnish for sashimi samplers. Seriously, who actually eats the white stuff? As for rolls.... I tried the salmon lovers which was ok, but it had way too much cream cheese and not enough salmon. The Cali crunch was good. 69  wasn't as great as I expected lol. The what the heck roll was different but I didn't care for it. Another thing I wasn't too fond of is how BIG each piece was. You would think that's a good thing but when it comes to sushi, I want to be able to eat the pieces in one comfortable ladylike bite. Haha. The service was decent, although I don't think they looked or acted professionally. It seemed borderline lazy. I also don't like their dinnerware. LOL. That's a funny thing to say but presentation is half of what makes food yummy. It's supposed to look good too. Cheap plastic plates that are in shapes that take up too much table space can make eating unappetizing and uncomfortable. So overall experience would actually be 3/5....but damn. That salmon wrap and tuna poke. I would keep coming back just for that alone. Quality of fish earns that extra star."}
{"text":"Sushi was good.  Service was slow.  Not bad if you have some time to waste before a movie, but not really worth it if you are traveling specifically to come here. There are better locations for sushi nearby."}
{"text":"This place is next to one of my other favorites, where I like to catch my Monday night Football games. It is delicious and the staff is very friendly"}
{"text":"Great find in Mesa. The house specialty rolls are creative and delicious. Be sure to try the What The Heck rolls! Will come back."}
{"text":"Searching for a great Sushi establishment in the area, I came across House Modern on Yelp. We decided that we would give it a try. Because it is in the same area as the Movie Theatre it made for an easy date. I was really impressed with the quality of the fish. We started off ordering 2 rolls- both had some kind of fried ingredient in the middle. They were very tasty- but we both wanted something a bit more \"fresh\" and simple. I started to look over the menu and could only find 2 rolls(specialty) that did not have a fried item. I do appreciate the occasional crunch in my roll, but I would like to see more raw options. The tuna we ordered was absolutely delish! I would definitely go back here if I were in the area- I have heard they have a great Happy Hour."}
{"text":"Great food!  Try the Baja or the Arizona rolls!  Several types of sake later.. It's all good!"}
{"text":"House Modern is located in the shopping complex next to the AMC theaters, and many, many other restaurants. I'm really surprised on the limited amount of good sushi places, and this place actually surprised me. They are family run and operated, and have some beautiful qualities, and some rough spots.   Decor: House Modern has outdoor and indoor seating with a small indoor seating arrangement. Inside has a bar menu, with some pictured food menus stapled along the wall with pricing. Kinda like a specials menu? But not quite the same. There is NO SUSHI BAR, so please keep this in mind, you won't be able to see how the rolls are being made.  Food: I will state, that I did enjoy the rolls that we ordered. My main draw back is that I usually don't eat at a sushi house unless they have a sit down sushi bar. I like to be able to see the quality of the fish, and if needed, ask for the paperwork to see how the fish comes in. Which by the way, is a legal thing to do. This is why the review isn't as strong, I don't feel 100% comfortable with not being able to see my sushi being made. Then, for dessert, we ordered Mochi. Which cost I believe $4 for 2 pieces, cut in quarters, with a little whipped cream. I found it unfortunate to see this. I could've went to the store and bought a box for $4.   Overall: The service was ok for the most part, and the food was ok. Will I go back? No, I won't. I don't feel that the price we paid for  the food was a justified experience. I felt that we were served frozen fish, or pre-made spicy tuna. I will probably  stick to my gut as a chef and dine at places that have a sushi bar, and the paperwork readily available.  P.S. Diana H, if you're one of the business owners our partners, it's in poor taste to send me a message calling me ignorant. Not only am I a chef, but I have managed and know food costs vs labor costs and where they should be allocated in pricing. So be careful who you try to bash."}
{"text":"I just finished eating dinner at this sushi restaurant around 8:30 PM and it has got to be the worst experience I've ever had, even worse than buffet sushi. This place is very far from the four stars it currently sits at.   I usually eat at Sakana in Ahwatukee, which for everyone that normally eats at House Modern Sushi I highly recommend to check out Sakana instead. If you do, you will see the huge difference in quality, quantity, and even pricing. There's a reason why that location is always packed, especially on the weekends.  I ordered the Chirashi (a traditional Japanese sashimi bowl) and a spicy tuna roll for my dinner. Not only was the rice dry and hard, the quality and portions of the sashimi and spicy tuna were very poor. I was charged $16.95 for a Chirashi bowl, and the sashimi cuts were extremely small. I have never seen sashimi so small in my entire life.  The fish also smelled, which is a bad sign that it isn't as fresh as it should be. Sakana pretty much does a Chirashi bowl for the same price, but the sashimi cuts are huge! I really wish I took pictures to show the vast difference.   Avoid this place at all costs, unless you just want to waste your money and have a bad food experience. For all you sushi fans, if you decide to go here be ready for a very rude awakening of just how bad sushi can be. I thought it was already bad at Shimogamo (another poor sushi restaurant ) but this takes the cake when it comes to being the worst."}
{"text":"I was looking for an LnL but was surprised with a Sushi restaurant. I was in the mood for short ribs, and thankfully they had it on the menu. It came with rice, soup, and salad, which was better than LnL's macaroni salad. The short ribs were just as good if not better. Overall, I'm satisfied. Also, it came with a free tempura ice cream for checking in on yelp!"}
{"text":"The sushi was bomb. Several choices. I would recommend \"What the Heck\"..we liked it so much we ordered another. Beautiful presentations but even better flavor profile. We will be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely love their specialty rolls! The Arizona roll is delish! Grab some miso soup, too!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and amazing service! We will most definitely be back and look forward to exploring the menu more. We had the shrimp lover and citea both very good and we had the tuna and salmon sashimi as well with tip $34 which is a great deal for a fantastic meal and exceptional service."}
{"text":"Was excited to try House Sushi after seeing all the positive Yelp reviews but came away with just an average experience.  Sushi was good, but nothing exceptional nor any better than the other sushi places in the vicinity.  What I couldn't get past was not having a sushi bar to sit at and not being able to watch the sushi chef prepare your sushi.  Just seemed odd for the sushi to come out of a back kitchen."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi spot. The service is great, the food is great. I have yet to try something there that I do not like."}
{"text":"So we went to get Hawaiian food (it used to be in this very place), and to our surprise, we found this restaurant instead.  After some hesitation we decided to try it.  WOW!  From the service to the food, everything is superb! The Miso soup is the best I've ever had.  The complementary salad was fresh, crunchy, and delicious!  My entree was heavenly.  I order the Asian Skirt Steak.  It came with onions and carrots and the side of rice (a very generous portion).  My husband ordered the Pork Katsu (recommended by our waitress), which turned out to be great as well.  To drink we order the hot tea, which was green tea and it tasted great -a wonderful complement to the meal.  When we were ready to pay, our waitress surprised us once more with cool orange pieces in the cutest presentation ever!  We didn't try the sushi, but I'll get some girlfriends together and try that the next time.  I definitely recommend this place and will be back again."}
{"text":"I also got a restaurant.com coupon for this place, and we were definitely not disappointed. The ambiance and atmosphere are wonderful, the service was super friendly and really really helpful, and the food was DIVINE. We ordered the Crazy California and the Crazy Philadelphia, a Shrimp Tempura Roll, a Vegas Roll and a Crispy Salmon Roll. They were all excellent, although they deep fry their shrimp tempura roll and I prefer mine to be not fried it was STILL fantastic. The seaweed was not too soft but not too chewy, the rice was the perfect stickiness and the fried rolls were the perfect crunch with no stale-oil taste. They gave us edamame on the house for it being our first time, which was much appreciated and only added to the comfortable environment they have created there. We also ordered hot tea which was delicious. I really enjoyed myself and we will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Ate here about a month or so ago and it is all I can think of. I couldn't remember the name of the place, so I spent an hour on Yelp looking at restaurants in the area until I found this place again. All the food was AMAHZING, especially the Tako Salad. I can't wait until I rendezvous here again!!"}
{"text":"This place wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be. The sushi is was the same quality you'd find at a grocery store. My roll had a big piece of plastic wrap stuck on it. They didn't give me wasabi and ginger until I asked for it. Meh."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Dropped by for lunch. Server was awesome. Food was fresh and delicious. Got the yellowtail which was DELICIOUS! Baja was good but not quite what we wanted I think. We had to make room for a third and decided to try the vampire which I also liked. All good choices for a fresh not fried type of flavor. We love fried rolls too, just didn't order any today"}
{"text":"Delicious sushi! Haven't had a bad roll yet. Very quiet. Great prices and friendly staff. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is epic! Best sushi in town.  You gotta try this place their food is soooo good"}
{"text":"Went here on Friday night, came in an hour before it closed (still feel bad about that). I was impressed by the service, very friendly and helpful. The sushi was pretty good though! I will definitely be back there again to try the other rolls..and I also heard the Chicken Katsu sandwich is good, so I might just have that instead. Anyways, we ordered a bunch of rolls,  I REALLY liked the What The Heck roll, it was so goooood! Oh and the Spicy Tuna roll, so much flavor. I also liked the Screaming 'O'.. the sushi was really fresh andddd you know, definitely satisfying. Also, the desert, I really don't know what it was called (I am assuming tempura ice-cream), was phenomenal! I could eat a bunch of those at once..but then I would be fat, I don't want to be fat :(  One thing though.. I would like to apologize for my friends and I being very obnoxious, opps!   But yeah, we were all satisfied and I will be coming here again! :)"}
{"text":"If you judged a book by its cover, you probably would not consider going into this sushi joint flanked by a movie theater and a Starbucks.  Luckily, if you are here, you like to get input from fellow foodies.  And as you can see - this is the place to go for sushi!  What makes this place great are the creative offerings and the super friendly service.  Start off with the House edamame (special hot sauce).  Then continue on to the very creative rolls.  Surf 'n turf was a fantastic fusion of steak and spicy fish while yellowtail lover was one of the best yellowtail rolls I've ever had.  But the crowning achievement was the appropriately named What the Heck roll - a mix of a whole bunch of stuff that translated into hot deliciousness.    I heard the tempura ice-cream here was great too, but we were too full from the great sushi this time.  Definitely one of the top sushi places in the Valley."}
{"text":"I really can't praise this place enough! It has been 6 months since my first review and our first visit to this restaurant, and all our meals since then have been just as spectacular! We have brought our friends here and they are all 5-star converts as well!   My husband and I have always enjoyed trying new rolls and they have all been interesting and delicious.   The udon here is phenomenal. I usually don't finish my broth at other restaurants, but here I lick the bowl clean. I'll order it even when it's burning hot outside -- that broth is addictive! If only they made ramen as well....lol  The food and the family that owns the place are truly delightful. Love, love, love!!!"}
{"text":"You get what you pay for. The prices here are cheap and the sushi reflects that quality. We ordered a tuna role, albacore role and avocado roll and they were nothing but rice. Might as well have just gotten a side of rice for all the fish we got. Advice: go elsewhere if you want sushi that actually has something besides rice and seaweed."}
{"text":"Steve and his family rock. Wonderful sushi! I put this above all my other reviews. Please try this place out if you haven't already."}
{"text":"Great sushi. Fairly priced. Music is hard to listen to but overall a good experience every time."}
{"text":"i love this place! it's such a cute little restaurant and the food is amazing =] loved all the rolls and appetizers that we tried and the service was great. highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"We've been searching for a good sushi place for years and tonight we finally found it! House Modern Sushi truly lived up to its good reviews!  The restaurant is SMALL - so you may have prepare yourself for a wait. There is also no actual sushi bar (everything is made in the kitchen).   We had the \"What the heck!\", \"Crunch Scallop\" and the Baja - each of the rolls was unique, fresh and very satisfying! I've eaten at a TON of sushi places and these were very creative rolls but you could still taste the fresh fish even with some of the bold sauces.  We ended our meal with the tempura ice cream - nice little end to our meal  We are definitely excited to come back to try different rolls :)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi restaurant of all time .  The ambience is clean and modern with a little bit of everything for whatever taste buds need to be taken care of .  My faves are the Baja and the 69 .  Saki is not too shabby either but most importantly the salad dressing on their house salad is a family secret for generations noe and I love the stuff if anyone figures out the recipe help a brother out !"}
{"text":"I've been here countless times, I figured it was time to write a review. This is my go to sushi spot in the East Valley. It has a great combination of traditional and modern sushi rolls. Their prices are decent especially at lunch. I like the atmosphere as well. It says,\"This is a sushi restaurant but laid back.\"  Its a bit off the beaten path but definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"Not sure where everyone that loves this place has had sushi before, but it's a tiny storefront with almost no ambiance, the prices were to high for what you got, the rolls really weren't all that good (not bad, just not tasty), selling a can of soda for $1.50(???), and the server talked way too much while we were trying to eat.  On the plus side, the What the Heck roll was interesting and very nice looking.  On the down side, the fish in the Philly Roll was very fishy and did not taste fresh...  I would not return here."}
{"text":"What a surprise this place was. Tucked in the back of a strip mall. The sushi was excelent, the fish was fresh and the service was great. The rolls are also reasonably priced 10-13$. I will definitely be back. And ya there is no sushi bar but I go for the food not the show."}
{"text":"The \"Tuna Karai\" was an awesome fusion of ahi tuna and jalapeño peppers! Be sure to get something to counter the heat - and no wasabi necessary!  The menu is full of original sushi and sashimi creations - as well as the typical items. Be adventurous and try something new - I did and it was great!"}
{"text":"One of the best sushi venues in the valley. It is a family owned and operated sushi restaurant with a liquor license at the splash of art throughout!  I love their secret salad dressing sauce which apparently is a family secret for three generations.  I'm guessing it has apple sauce carrots and ginger but what else is completely unknown. Another favorite of mine is the service second to none they love to chat and make sure that you're completely satisfied with all that you have been the best place thus far!"}
{"text":"I have to say, this one is not a good sushi at all. this one is one of the worst sushi ever. Costco sushi even taste better than this.  I'm sorry, I know that this place just open a week ago, but.. I can't say anything positive about the food. The place used to be a fastfood restaurant (hawaian bbq) that is being converted into sushi join. but with No sushi bar (surprise). yes the place have a great service, friendly and bright. but I'm only rate based on quality of the food. yes I'm in phoenix, but still, there are some other decent place to eat. unless they fix on how they prepare the sushi. they'll not get any repeat customer. yes they gave me free ice-cream and other sashimi."}
{"text":"Came here today for a friend's birthday celebration. I made a reservation yesterday and that went very smoothly. When everyone arrived they had reserved a section of the restaurant for my group.  We brought in our own cake and the owners were very nice about storing it for us. We were seated and drinks came very fast. When we ordered there was no problem, the issue here is that they only have what seems like one person in the kitchen. For a large group this did not work well as when we all got our food it was at different times and the first person to eat was already finished when the last person was just getting their food. The food was very slow. With that being said, the food was also very good. The chef put in a lot of effort and care into each dish and made them excellent. It's obvious the sushi rolls were made from scratch the amount of time it took them to come out. The \"What the Heck\"roll is amazing and must try. For an appetizer I recommend the popcorn scallop, real scallops. They were nice to provide plates and knives for the cake as well.  I believe if only two people came in for dinner the food speed would not be an issue."}
{"text":"I'm going to write this place off as just one of those things in which Mesa patrons are just not capable of giving accurate info when it comes to sushi.   Our experience?  Pretty terrible.  I have a few standbys I get everywhere to compare.  One is a spider roll.  DO you freshly fry the crab or are you lazy?  This place was lazy.  Not warm at all.  \"Look at all that cool different stuff on the ad on the table, do you have that stuff?\" server: \"No\".  wth is the point of having some goofy food distributor ad with options that you don't have?  We wound up ordering much less than normal just to get out while we could so it was more like half of a meal.    We got a few other things that were all underwhelming leading me to lump it up with 90% of sushi places in town.... they fall into the DO NOT RETURN category.  I have a feeling an east valley native 4 star at a sushi place is equal to a 1.5-2 star review for people not from land locked states.  Minus points for no sushi bar too.  Now to the best part.  A fella with a heavy country accent, Wranglers and a cowboy hat rolled in with another fella.  This was his time to show off and puff his chest out with how worldly he was.  \"I want you to fry me some of that salmon and then put some of that sauce on it... yeah.. the panko stuff... yeah with that aoli stuff too\".  Did I just hear that correctly?  Take sashimi grade salmon and fry it?  Maybe that is the target audience...  This is an average run of the mill place.  Not good, not awful.  The disappointing part was the buildup with the rave reviews.  Went expecting exceptional, not underwhelming.  Part of me thinks people are reviewing sushi for best prices, not best quality or flavor.  If you like RA, this place will be fine.  If you struggle finding good sushi, keep looking."}
{"text":"Great little sushi joint thats tucked in shopping center.  There's plenty of sushi places around but this one is one step above the surrounding competition.  Its family owned and operated so service is warm (surprisingly for an asian family owned joint).  The great thing about it is the menus HAS PICTURES of the actual roll itself and a description.  My biggest pet peeve is not knowing what my sushi will look like.  Most sushi have ridiculous names and the description generally barely helps (THINK RA SUSHI).  I like the non-tradtional concoctions that House Sushi has made up.  2 things that i look for in sushi is portion and taste.  The portions are HUGE (unlike RA SUSHI) and deffinitely filling.  And second is the taste, i love it when my sushi has its own separate sauce to it.  not too much to drown it, and not too little to make it seem like just decoration.  But enough that you can taste, dip, whatever.  So kudos to that.  All in all good food at even better prices.  All their specialty rolls are UNDER $10!  HUGE ROLLS THAT ARE UNDER $10 is great.  Cant beat this place if you're in the area for great sushi.  PRO -Pictures on the menu -HUGE portions (1 fills me up) -great sauces -great sushi -CHEAAPPPPP PRICES -happy hour specials too!  Cons -small place -not big on drinks -the male waiter is a total hottie, so distracting to eat.  (hahahha)"}
{"text":"California roll, teriyaki chicken, tempora all very delicious.  The house salad was over the top! Great restaurant with nice staff!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed house modern sushi! The seating is comfortably placed and the wait time was very reasonable. Also very reasonably priced. Awesome sushi rolls and miso soup! The rolls were unique, some new kinds! Very fresh ingredients and fresh fish. Great sake bombs! Clean environment as well. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Went in at 10:30 last night to grab a couple quick rolls. Nothing fancy or time consuming. First thing upon walking through the door they pointed out that they closed at 11. Ok fair enough. I understand nobody wants to have to stay at work late for inconsiderate people who walk in the door minutes before closing time but we still had 30 min (and were done eating and out the door by 11pm) the food never tastes bad but holy crap the fact that they didn't wanna deal with any more customers showed in the presentation of the food. Chicken eggrolls with like 3 tiny pieces of chicken in them and the sushi rolls falling apart,half in size and oddly mishapen. If you don't want customers in half an hr before closing time you should not allow any orders to be put in after 10:30. Just a recommendation to improve service. I wanna come back but when I mentioned it to the waiter he laughed it off and walked away. Probably just gonna take my chances elsewhere next time"}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi I have EVER had, including various places in Vancouver and California. I ordered takeout, so I can't say for the dining experience.  I ordered the gyoza, a caterpillar roll, rainbow roll, and avacado roll. The gyoza was delicious, not soggy from its Styrofoam packaging to my house, which is a real feat. It had just a bit of kick to it, enough for my very white person taste beds to freak out at first, lol.  The caterpillar roll was really the star of the show here. Normally it's my second fave, with the rainbow being to top of my list. Today was a shocker. This is by far the best caterpillar roll ever. The insides were CRISPY! The sauce was used to absolute perfection, not a drop too much. Too many times have I eaten this roll drenched in sauce to the point of total mushyness, where you could not taste the individual flavours. This was amazing. This was one of the many times I have been happy my wife hates sushi, there was no way I would have shared!  The rainbow roll was delicious, the fish selections all very fresh and the crab insides flavourful and firm. It seemed a tad larger than the same roll from some other restaurants. One slice in particular was so large I barely fit it in my mouth. Not saying that's a bad thing, the more generous with the salmon and tuna the better! The same exceptional quality can be said for my avacado roll, the only thing I could have asked for on that is sesame seeds, but that's a personal preference.   I only knocked a star because I called at 9:30pm, and they only agreed to take my order because I live down the street and could be there in a few minutes. They apparently were closing early because they were slow (they were supposed to be open till 11). I get frustrated at businesses that don't stick to their posted operating hours. When my wife went to pick my food up they even had already closed up, ten minutes after my call."}
{"text":"The service was great and we really loved the mussels and the \"what the heck\" rolls. We'd definitely go again when we're in town."}
{"text":"The heck roll was aight but nothing special. There were enough finely diced peppers and tomatoes on top of the roll to make 4 servings of salsa. I was hoping there would be more flavors that popped out at me to make me say \"what the heck\" but that didn't happen. I really had high hopes for this roll from previous reviews about this roll. I liked the salmon roll better. It worked with the salmon, cream cheese and eel sauce."}
{"text":"Can't let this slide with such high rings. Decent food, but nothing wonderful here."}
{"text":"There's never anyone in the restaurant when I come which is very surprising to me because it is so good! Great house music always playing in the background and the sushi is absolutely delicious! Get the Miso soup and the crunchy scallop roll, SO GOOD. The only reason I took away a star is because the server is always bored so he isn't the most kind. The food makes up for it!!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and great food. Lunch specials are very affordable."}
{"text":"After contemplating the usual sushi places and denying my boyfriends' need to watch his food circulate the entire restaurant, I decided to give House a try. After reading all the reviews I already planned my order and I was not disappointed. Hands down the best sushi I've had in Arizona.  Others might see satisfaction through their wallet, I on the other hand don't mind the prices if the food is up to par, and House definitely delivers that and more.  We started off with the Agedashi tofu, Salmon skin salad and Salmon kama (collar). After the first bite I was hooked and it set the tone for the rest of the meal. I was thoroughly excited for what was next.  As per the reviews, we ordered the Sixty-nine and dynamite roll. After all of that, we still wanted more so we finished the meal with a What the heck and it blew our minds. We even saved 30% on rolls for happy hour!  We will definitely be coming back and trying their other offerings."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try this place since it was minutes from our home. We were not disappointed! We ordered a few rolls; the crazy California which was pretty good, the amigo and the Arizona were our favorites though. The rolls are smaller but this place offers 30 percent off all the time. We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi places that's close to me.  Usually not very packed, which I like. Everything I've gotten has been so good but my favorites are the amigo and Arizona rolls. Service is fast and they are very nice. I go almost once a week!"}
{"text":"Went here for a date night a few weeks ago, and I was surprised to see that it took the spot of what was once L&L BBQ. It's sort of a weird set up for a sushi restaurant, but it looks like they are making it work. It's very small though and it filled up quickly for dinner when we were there. We had gyoza, a california roll, and then two of their house rolls which we really liked. Everything was good, but I think I'm kind of burned out on sushi so I can't rave about it. I'd definitely recommend it though"}
{"text":"Good little surprise ! The Hawaiian and Baja rolls are super tasty! I enjoyed it very much.   The fish is fresh and there are plenty of choices. Some rolls are a little pricey but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi I've had in Scottsdale and the worst service I've had in Scottsdale too. I mean openly and rudeness, especially from the short chubby waitress.  The manager is super friendly though. I just hope he doesn't allow her to ruin another customer's experience there."}
{"text":"December for me means you will eat tamales, lots and lots of tamales. You will get tamales from your mother, your friends at work and you will even make your own.  I needed a break from tamales, and being too lazy to drive to the regular sushi place we decided to try this place.     The service was great , at first it was a little rushed but considering he was the only server there with quite a few tables he did a great job.   We started off with a tuna and avocado salad which was delicious! It would be perfect for lunch. We also had some nigiri salmon, which is my daughter's favorite sushi item.   We also had the What the Heck roll and another roll that had cooked salmon on top. The rolls were good, but I wouldn't order the cooked salmon roll again, stick with the raw fish.  One thing I noticed and was great full for at this bar is that they do not stuff all their rolls with imitation crab meat in the middle. I really dislike imitation crab meat and I dislike the was some sushi places have opted to include it in all their rolls.   Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Delicious!! Got a chicken entree, and 3 sushi rolls. The crazy California, what the heck, and my favorite, spicy tuna crunch. Nice staff, brought the food out quickly. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Best. Sushi. In. AZ.  For real though, this place blows me away. For reference, everything House Modern serves is delicious. They serve everything from katsu, udon, tempura, yakisoba, yakitori, miso, ramen, nigiri, and teriyaki. I've tried half of these so far, and they're all really good, but the sushi really does steal the show here.  If you just want some straight up old school sashimi or no frills nigiri sushi, they have any -- and I mean ANY -- kind of fresh fish you could ever want. Don't get me wrong, the classics are great, but at House Modern getting these or even a California Roll or Spicy Tuna is a damn shame. You'll understand why once you go.  They have over 30 specialty rolls that I have NEVER seen before. Nothing even like them. I've had sushi at dives and at top rated sushi bars all over SoCal, in the Bay Area, in Las Vegas, in Hawaii, and in New York. I have never been to a single restaurant with rolls as creative as this place has. It is legitimately crazy. And it's in Mesa, AZ of all the Godforsaken seafood locations. I mean this place is in a strip mall next to a movie theater, but it beats out renowned sushi bars on the Vegas Strip. The rolls range from around $8.00-$13.50, so about average market price, but they are worth so much more. If they opened up in LA with a couple thousand square feet of extra dining space, they could charge 4 times the price and be half as innovative.  If you really love California Rolls or think a Rainbow Roll is creative, don't even bother. Go to Got Sushi or Ra Sushi, they have juuust what you'll want. If you love seafood and want to try it in dozens (with an S) of ways you've never seen let alone thought about, House Modern will be a revelation.  Just as a side note, the couple who serve up front are tight. The service is lightning fast even when every table is full and even though there are only 2 servers. This place gets super busy on weekends when everyone's eating before going to a movie at AMC, yet sushi rolls and entrees still come out in about 10 minutes. The fast and friendly service is just icing on a deliciously fishy cake. HIGHLY recommended from a sushi junkie. And not a hipster-douchebag one, by the way."}
{"text":"We had a credit from Restaurants.com, so we were searching for a place nearby over the weekend to try out. Craving some sushi, we thought we'd try this place out. It used to be an L&L Hawaiian restaurant and has only been open for a few months - it's located right next to the Starbucks.   Service - Outstanding. It's a family joint, literally, the daughter was our server, the dad was the chef, the brother was taking photos of the food, the mom was working on some operational stuff behind the counter - it doesn't get much more mom-pop shop than this - but of course with a little more swank.   Food - Delicious! Miso soup was so good. Started with their house edamame, yum (although a bit peppery). I had the Vegas Roll - probably the best I've ever had. Hubby had a sampler plate that included a lil bit of everything. He doesn't even normally like rolls (he's much more of a sushi or sashimi guy) but he even agreed my Vegas roll was out of this world. Topped it off with some Tempura ice cream - can it get any better? Oh and plating was beautiful.   Prices - Really not bad - pretty standard for your typical sushi restaurant. Helped that we had the coupon.   Atmosphere - Really warm and welcoming. You could tell there was a table full of some family friends. We were the only other table in there, til another couple came in shortly after, also trying the place out for the first time. So it was a bit slow for a Friday night, but I think it's only because they're so new. Decor was really nice though. Music was a bit loud.   Only con I could see is they didn't serve alcohol, which isn't a big deal because I'm preggo and we're not big drinkers anyways. That could just be because they're in the process of getting their liquor license though, I don't know.   All in all, we will for sure be back here. Without a doubt."}
{"text":"Super delish! Their specialty rolls are spectacular! A tad hard on the wallet but quite worth it."}
{"text":"When i first realized L&L was gone i was disappointed, but that was soon eclipsed by joy after i had a taste of what they had to offer.    An example would be the potato croquette to start out with, it is basically mashed potato fried to crispy goodness with a to die for katsuesque sauce drizzled on top.. next up would be the surf n turf roll which is amazing, not often do you find filet mignon on a roll.. i enjoyed the hamachi kama too, which is a cooked to perfection yellowtail collar, pure bliss.  Then to wash it all down they have a iced barley tea that is super refreshing, i am sorry but exact name escapes me, which is ironic because you have to ask for it by name..   oh and i can not forget the tempura ice cream, it is fried ice cream at its best.     This is honestly the best sushi joint in Arizona since Celsius closed down (if anyone has been there).. i eat all around the valley too.. but do not take my word for it, try it yourself, you will not be disappointed one bit, i promise."}
{"text":"We stopped in to try somewhere new and really enjoyed it! It's tucked away and pretty small but we were pleased! Saw some new combinations and recipes I haven't before! Serves is a pretty slow but very friendly."}
{"text":"This is my (and my group's) new sushi spot! They are friendly, and the food is great! I am one of the few in the world that loves Uni (sea urchin). It's hard to find here in the valley, but they have it here! I just call in and see if they have it. If they,  do I get my happy a$$ over there quick!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place and arrived on a Sunday at noon. We Were the first table in and were greeted immediately. Menu is simple and easy to choose from. We ordered three rolls a fantastic, Vegas and shrimp lovers. Rolls arrived quickly. Oh my goodness so good! We finished off all three in 15 minutes. Will certainly be back.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"Japanese Lasagna was one of the best speciality sushi rolls I've tried..ever.. not just for Arizona. Great customer service, solid location (in complex next to AMC), and a chill atmosphere. My friends got the seafood udon and said it was delicious as well. Deff try this place out!"}
{"text":"This place has fresh sushi but like all sushi places it comes with a price.  The rolls were yummy and the sashimi even better.  We got Ono(white tuna), salmon, and yellowtail, beef tataki.. all the fish was super fresh! The beef tataki however I was not a big fan of.. its more cooked than usual (which some people actually prefer), I like mine like sashimi. The resturant is quite small.. which baffled me when we had to sit there for over 10 mins waiting for someone to help us, don't get me wrong the workers are friendly but they seemed to just stand around instead of taking our order.  Once we got over that small bump it was smooth sailing,  the only thing that wasn't good was the udon.. so little for such high price.  For now I'll give a 3 star, maybe when I come back next time my mind will be changed."}
{"text":"Man is it hard to find good sushi in AZ  Almost as hard as finding good Mexican x_x   House Modern does fusion sushi (AKA lots of spicy sauce and mango dressing) and nigiri up to my standards and will be a place I will frequent in Mesa for my maguro needs.  Definitely not the best when compared to Cali sushi joints but is leagues better then the other places I have eaten in Arizona. Plus the fact that they have a lot of choices on the menu bodes to good things, though they didn't have hirame in stock when I visited.  ;_;   (They also have a 20% deal on rolls and sushi right now)"}
{"text":"3.5 stars, but the best sushi I've had in Az so far.  And by sushi, I'm not talking about deep fried rolls with lots of sauce or hot sauce on them.  I'm talking about the fish.  The saba wasn't the normal crappy saba you get in Az.  It was mildly strong (i.e., perfect).  The shiro mutsu was buttery and very fresh.  The hamachi was the best hamachi I've had in a while, including all of my sushi eating in the Bay area.  Good hot appetizers as well (e.g., agedashi tofu).  Service was good and the tables were wobbly.  I'll be back if I have a sushi craving while I'm in Az."}
{"text":"Wide selection of specialty rolls. Loved that they had pictures of them also, it's hard sometimes to \"see\" what each roll is in your head. Staff was pleasant and it was a chill environment. Would def come back"}
{"text":"We ordered assorted tempura, beef stir fry, salmon delight, Arizona roll, California roll, rainbow roll, albacore and tuna nigiri. All the fish looked good quality. I only tasted the salmon delight roll, which was good. On the side salad that comes with the meals they use a wasabi dressing which I thought was awesome! My poor mom ordered a side salad on its own and it came with that usual orange color dressing and not the wasabi dressing. She said it was weird. Her roll and only dish besides the salad came out as every one was finishing their meal. Bummer. The waitress was a little sloppy. She was a little too rough with putting down plates and was a little more interested in the regular at the table behind me when we were ordering. I wasn't sure if she was actually taking my order or the guy behind me's order. To my relief she got everything. The restaurant itself is a decent size but I don't know how they handle larger groups."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!! Appetizers came out at a normal time then it took 45 minutes to bring out 2 basic rolls. Our server was practically avoiding our table. We had to flag her down several times to check on our order and she had a bad attitude every time. They are not up on customer service. The food was OK but not worth the hassle at all. Plus my veg roll was totally disappointing. It was basically lettuce and rice wrapped in seaweed (I order this regularly at other sushi places and it was hands down the worst one I've ever had). I like to be valued as a customer and not treated as an inconvenience. Never ever again."}
{"text":"Do you know what sets this place apart from the sea of sushi restaurants that have opened up lately? Family. The owner is a super nice, upbeat twenty-something guy who purchased the restaurant on a shoe string budget with his aunt. He is a hands on type of guy who will gladly come to your table and offer a smile and a little bit of back story to his restaurant. He made us feel welcome as though we were part of the family. THAT is what sets this place apart from the rest.   Oh, you want to know about the sushi? The sushi is delicious! What I liked about this place was the variety of house or special rolls. I like going to a sushi restaurant that doesn't have run-of-the-mill rolls. I enjoy seeing creativity! Keeping a menu fresh is so important with all the sushi places out there now.   House does a wonderful job of differentiating themselves. Go there, and see for yourself. It's not just a House, it's home; home of new and modern sushi creations. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  Some of the best sushi to get this far out in the East Valley, by far.  My wife and I have tried the rolls, the nigiri, some noodles, and their katsu.  We've also been given some special off-menu items.  We have enjoyed everything here and the only reason this place is not 5 stars is because, if I'm going to be fair and honest and compare this place to the best Japanese places we've been, I just can't give it 5 stars.  But I say again, this place is very good, especially considering it's location.  The nigiri here is decently priced and is solid.  The rolls are actually kind of the specialty here and you can fill up on these guys for a decent price as well.  They are a little different from other places, a little more creative.  I'e gotten the katsu here for lunch multiple times and it is solid katsu, it will fill you up for lunch.  The noodles here have been fine but probably the weakest of the dishes here.  The owner ships special orders of geoduck and oysters when in-season for the weekends,  If they are available, get them.  They are a delicious addition to an already solid menu, but because of their freshness, go above and beyond the quality of the other menu items.  This will not be the best sushi of your life, or the best katsu, etc.  But it will be very good for a great price.  We drive out of our way to get tot his place, you should too."}
{"text":"Well, I can finally say I've had bad sushi! My fiancé and I came here because of the great reviews. Our experience went something like this: We arrived at 8pm on a Friday night. 4 out of 9 tables were empty, which made us feel lucky (at first). We stood at the door for 5 minutes, no one acknowledged us; I knew we couldn't seat ourselves because I had called ahead to see if they had a wait. When the waitress sat us, it was at a HELLLLLLA dirty table. Not just 'accidentally forgot to clean it bc it wasn't bad', this was huge soy sauce stains, tempura crumbs, etc kind of filth. It took an unusually long time to bring us menus, and when she did, she ignored me as I tried to say \"heyyyyy, the table is dirty.\" She placed our menus right down on the dirty table! After the table was clean, we ordered drinks. (Green tea for me/sprite for Jason) This part also took FOREVER. By the time she came back we had already discussed their ridiculous House Rolls. I like trying new combinations of flavors, but some of these pairings sounded so trifling. WAY too much going on. But we decided to try two House Rolls for fun (amigo and hot night) and a \"safe\" go-to, Dragon Roll. They brought each roll out 10 minutes apart, which is the worst. So I can say we had clean palates when trying each one. The amigo was ok. The hot night had a tempura fried roll (warm) and COLD crab on top.  *shudder* We only ate 2 pieces. When the dragon roll finally came out, I knew something was wrong, from the look of it. We tried a piece anyway. Yep. Something very very very wrong with the eel. Not once did the waitress check on us, we only saw her when she dropped off our food. Oh, and I forgot: she refilled Jason's drink without him asking. Which would normally be nice, except she refilled his half full SPRITE with WATER. I have never left that much sushi behind. I have actually never had a meal, let alone sushi, that was not edible."}
{"text":"This is a hidden restaurant in a shopping mall next to the movie theater. Currently, they have happy hour all day. This means you get 30% off the rolls. The rolls are on the more expensive side, but it is quality. Don't judge that it is in a shopping center. The service is awesome. My glass of water was always full. There are a lot of options for unique rolls. I had the 69 roll and it was spicy and all good. Their squid and seaweed salad were also fresh. This is def a good place to go for some quality sushi."}
{"text":"Another 3.5 star restaurant ~ I'll bump it up to 4 stars only because they have fresh oysters imported from Boston! =) Mmmmmm! I would still say the oysters in New Orleans grown in 1/2 fresh water and 1/2 salt water are more to my liking. I tried the 69 and WTH roll -- but my favorite roll was the roll with fresh avocado, tomatoes and a hint of spicy mayo placed on the side. The people that own the place are really nice. I stayed outside after to chat upon closing, and the employees even gave me a free H2O bottle to combat the heat. They're really nice here and I always like those that are friendly! =)"}
{"text":"I enjoyed their nightly sashimi special, with Echigo rice beer, and great service. I will return. Thank you house of modern sushi."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place in Mesa...maybe even all of Phoenix. The owners are nice and chill. The fish is fresh and delicious. I love happy hour because you get 10% of your sushi rolls and I haven't tried anything I don't like. I come here often with my husband and friend."}
{"text":"So far so good...great menu, great selection!  Ordered taking salad, shrimp lovers roll and Arizona roll."}
{"text":"Great sushi.. awsome service!! Jjust sucks its in a strip mall.. good place to grab a bite before or after a movie... saki bombs!"}
{"text":"Absolute Best Sushi in town!  We come here often!  Favorite rolls are \"what the heck\" and \"screaming roll\"... Love the atmosphere. Love the house music and vibe of this restaurant! Family owned and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"This place is still 30% off of sushi rolls (dine-in only) for their grand opening, even though they've been opened for about 5 months. I dont know how long it's going to last but it definitely makes this place worth it - not that i even used this discount since we had their lunch combo special. $7.50 for 2 rolls and soup and salad. Totally worth it.  My spicy crab roll was really good - their spicy sauce is actually spicy! The shrimp tempura roll was just as good. Their miso soup was also made well. I dont really like their salad, which is drenched in this really sweet dressing that looks like carrot purree - no love for that.  This place is owned by a japanese family and they do a very good job with their food.  Free wi-fi from Starbucks next door hehehehe"}
{"text":"I ordered the Baja roll and a house salad. The fish was not fresh. The server didn't know what kind of tuna it was, but it just didn't taste fresh. He also disappeared for awhile and seemed to go to Starbucks and then take a smoke break, and when he finally came back, he just smelled like cigarette smoke. Gross! The house salad had a ginger dressing that tasted overly spicy and needed more flavor. I sent the roll back. Wouldn't recommend this place at all. If you want good sushi, try Sushi Roku in Scottsdale. Their fish is always fresh."}
{"text":"I never get sushi for lunch... but today I got sushi for lunch.  {rant}However, what I really want to talk about was how Yelp directions, a-la Google maps, decided to route me around the entire Wal-Mart parking lot, subjecting me to untold peril at the hands of amateur roll-back seekers and creatively bespectacled geriatrics whose forte would be anything but vehicular-centric.{/rant}  The place was suspiciously empty upon arrival, which always makes me a little antsy.  Are there no customers because the quality is lacking, or are the previous occupants of my current seat deceased, stacked neatly in the walk in freezer?  My fears eased after whipping out my scorpion light while inconspicuously spraying luminol.  After fanning away the ammonium carbonate smell, I was ready to order, and order I did.  Playing it safe, I went with the Baja roll, because it had like double tuna and was adorned with crispy tortilla strips... much like a chicken tortilla soup, without the mock poultry or intensely painful mouth blisters.  I initially thought it was drizzled with cilantro aioli, which I mentioned several times to the chef in an attempt to win him over with my nutritive know-how... only to be corrected that it was indeed a jalapeno vinaigrette.  \"Ah, but of course!  Much like its distant cousin, the aioli\", I shot back, saving culinary face.  One order of the house edamame was appropriated, along with an iced tea, which must have been freshly brewed, given its strength.  And the soybean pods were bathed in a piquant garlic sauce/spread/aioli which kept the Vampire rolls at bay.  The chef was quite friendly, stopping by the table for further banter, in which I found out that (a) he dabbles in cosmetology cut and coloring, (b) he has a fondness for a Hamlet quote, and (c) has conducted several experiments relating to food allergies.  He is in the running for the most interesting sushi chef in the world.  He invited me back M-Th for 20% off rolls.  At least I think he did... my mind was still pondering the imy Hamlet quote"}
{"text":"This place is definitely my favorite sushi spot. A few of my favorites are the shrimp cracker, crazy philly roll, fantasy roll and the Arizona roll. Their Hamachi sashimi is also so good. My boyfriend always gets the chicken katsu and it is perfect every time. Very good rice and the sauce is perfect. We probably go here once a week (sometimes twice, lol...its right down the street from us) and have never once been disappointed with food or service. The people here are great!"}
{"text":"I so wanted to give this place a higher score coming back, I went a total of 3 times,  I wrote briefly about the first visit, and was an epic fail the 2nd visit, which was Friday, I left on a friendly note, saying \"Okay you don't want my money today, I'll come back another time\" That was today Monday... (I did go to sushi somewhere else) but the convenience  of this place so close to the house gave me high hopes!  The catapillar roll was surely a safe bet for my 10 year old for it was the best I ever had last time. I took a bite while my lovely child ate her hand roll. It was awful. I said nothing.... She finished her roll happily, then went for the catapillar roll. and pushed it away, my food came out the spicy mayo tasted like sugar, and no spice.  the rice was sweet I said something he confirmed it, said something like \" this place needs a lot of work , it is going through changes, (it doesn't even have a \"sushi bar\" )  he brought out a philly roll for my kid, she wouldn't eat either.  my food was much smaller which is good cuz it was horrible \"Do you put sugar in the rice?\"   He said  this place lacked consistency (you think?)  and he charged me full price, if he would have taken off one roll  I would have tipped him that money, the \"Bosses mom\" came over to say he works Monday and Tuesdays... I said that doesn't matter we won't be back, keep in mind I am someone that says sauce on the side, and no sweet ever on my rolls the sauce was not on the side and it was sweet, I tossed away over 120 bucks for two visits where we tried to eat.   He is moving to Canada or somewhere, well good luck.  He is a really nice guy, but If I had cash on me I would have thrown 30 bucks at them and said I didn't eat the other rolls. It is different for most \"American sushi eaters\" they like eel sauce, I don't like sweet sushi, sweet spicy sauce or sweet rice. Beware, if you like sweet sushi, the place is \"OKAY\" at best. lots of luck,  he did say one of the things they are working on is getting a sushi bar, instead of walking into the kitchen for 30 minute intervals (nobody else in the place) anyhow We will keep on the lookout for a new place.  in the mean time we have places that have some decent food.  I think it is just time to give up sushi... sigh :("}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi spot in Arizona. I have brought many friends here and the all loved it! Lovely family owned business. They always remember my family and make us feel welcomed. Love the modern vibe, and the sushi is amazing!!"}
{"text":"Went there today for lunch. Looked up good sushi in Gilbert and this popped up fist. So glad I read the reviews and went. A mom and pop sushi house, nothing fancy. The best sushi I have had in town by far. We had the 69 roll, which was ok, it sits on a bed of sauce that kinda make the rice mushy. The salmon on top was very fresh and tasty. We also had the Hawaiian, spicy tuna crunch and the crazy Philly. The last two are both tempura fried and yummy. The tuna on top of the Hawaiian was perfect! We have been to all the Big name sushi place around town and find them expensive and lacking in the fresh tasty department. I love supporting local people and finding that place that is tucked away. It is to the left of the AMC movies right off of Stapley. Doesn't seem very busy, which was perfect for lunch, but I hope many people find this place and give it a try!!"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a new sushi place since my fav closed and may have found it. We tried four different rolls and we snarfed them all with relish! Nice atmosphere, fair price for good rolls, friendly staff. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Been here a dozen times and the sushi is consistently good! You're just not going to find great sushi in Phoenix, but this place comes very close. They are the best out of a handful of sushi joints in the east valley. Friendly, timely and as mentioned consistently good quality! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great time last night. Ordered the What The Heck, Vegas, 69, sake bombers, miso soup,a couple chicken dishes and much more. Food was 100%. Servers were casual yet attentive and they knew the menu well. We were able to make reservations a couple hours in advance with no problems. There were about 4 or 5 tables being served constantly which is about 50% of the restaurant. Kind of a bad location way off stapley dr behind a Starbucks. Fried cheesecake was the biggest hit for the adults and kids. Prices were a good value since the quality if the food was so high."}
{"text":"I decided to have lunch before a movie. around May of 2012. I was going to give this place a low score because the Ikura and quail egg sushi I ordered looked terrible. I wasn't even going to eat it until the server saw that I did not even touch it. He brought out a fresh dish and that changed my mind. The oysters were great, good size and good seasoning."}
{"text":"This was my first visit and I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of food. Great atmosphere and reasonable prices. I enjoyed my experience over all and would recommend this establishment to any one."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Arizona!! Hands down!! Check out this hole in the wall. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Ron Swanson from Parks and Recreation might say, \"Fish, for sport only, not for meat. Fish meat is practically a vegetable.\" but for me, fish is life.  You had me at sushi.  I was invited out to grab some sushi today and if you know me, I'd never turn down an opportunity to pig out on fish.  Not wanting to go to the same old restaurant, we decided to fire up the Yelp app and off we went to try someplace new!  Enter: House Modern Sushi Restaurant.  When we walked in, the place was desolate.  I swear a tumbleweed blew past our ankles as we stood there giving each other the eye.  I think our telepathy needs work because while I was trying to egg the lunch companion to go next door, he was eyeing the pictures on the wall.  Guess it's meant to be.  The fish was fresh.  It smelled of the ocean instead of fish which is always a good sign because if fish smelled of fish, you probably shouldn't be eating it.  We had started things off with House Edamame which had so much garlic, I smelled it from a meter away as it was brought to our table.  We also shared Ahi Tuna Poke, a Baja Roll, and a Vampire Roll.  The Poke was pretty refreshing as it was served on a bed of seaweed salad.  I was wishing it had some avocados but hey, it was still delicious and I found myself shoveling down the majority of the poke.  I wish they went a little lighter-handed on the onions.  I love it when the fish is cut into big generous chunks.  The Baja Roll was also AMAZING.  It was so fresh and the alfalfa sprouts gave it a nice texture and don't get me started on that jalapeno vinaigrette.  Mmm!  As for the Vampire Rolls, it was decent and spicy.  It was that kind of burn that incinerates your mouth for a minute and then dies away.  I could have done without this one.  All in all, it was a great lunch and the server was friendly!  Water and iced tea was refilled quickly and we walked away with full tummies."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good and at a fair price. Service could use a little work. If that were to improve then it would get 5 stars."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the variety of choices as far as rolls go, not just the usual staples, but some interesting house specials as well. Everything was fresh and very tasty. With all the rolls and sashimi we ordered, our wait was no more than average on a Saturday night. I was really happy to see that it is family owned/operated and that the whole family participated in the meal.    Being that it is located right next the the AMC theater, if you have tickets to see a flick and plan to eat here first, I would make sure that you allow for extra time to eat so that no one is rushed. We saw a couple tables rush without finishing everything to get to their movie in time."}
{"text":"Since moving out to Mesa, I've been looking for a go to sushi place since I eat it almost every week. Well thankfully I have finally found it! If you love great service and delicious sushi then I highly recommend this place. They have pretty straight forward menu that isn't to crazy. Their rolls are simpler, not in a bad way, compared to other sushi restaurants that I've been to. My personal favorite is the tiger roll. It has shrimp tempura, crab mix and cucumber inside, and  spicy ahi(tuna) on top. That is what I get every time.   Ohh another awesome thing about this place. Their sushi doesn't fall apart when you try to pick it up =) Made to perfection.   ENJOY!"}
{"text":"We went last night and used our restaurant.com gift certificate. There were 2 other tables using the same thing while we were there. When we got there there was only one other table of two. While there two others came in. The service was very slow. I think we were there almost 90 minutes. My dinner came out 20 minutes before my husbands did. The sushi came out last. It was very very slow. The others seemed to feel the same way. The food was good, family run place...  We had 2 hours before our movie started otherwise we would have been really upset."}
{"text":"Went back with my youngest today and had a wonderful meal. I do wish that the miso came with the meal instead of separate, and the young waitress couldn't be any more disinterested in hearing a thank you, lol. Quick to get back on her cell phone. Oh well, didn't take away at all from the deliciousness of the food. Side note: I used the restroom on this visit and was impressed with the cleanliness. Always a good sign."}
{"text":"I find it amazing the reviews this place got Pros = 0 Cons  You can't see the sushi bar The fried tempura rolls taste like old oil The physical dining room is dingy Sushi is very bland  Service is horrible, one kid took care of all the tables.  Not sure how he decided to wait on when. It definitely was not in order. A couple came in and all the tables were either occupied or dirty and I'm not sure what the kid did but he didn't clear a table for them so they left.  No I will not be returning"}
{"text":"Went back today and the service was very slow, the roll we got with fried shrimp was really really heavily battered could hardly taste the shrimp.  I think I'll stick to my local favorite.  Prices we a bit steep."}
