{"text":"J'y suis allée souvent lors de dîner entre collègues puisqu'ils ont une salle plus privée pour les groupes qui est très bien. Le restaurant est propre et moderne, voilà les points positifs.
Malheureusement, le service n'est jamais égal. Parfois excellent et rapide, parfois lent et ordinaire. C'est toujours une surprise!

La nourriture y est correcte, sans plus. Cette fois-ci, j'ai choisi les tortellini au fromage à la sauce rosée. Mauvaise idée! La sauce, ou plutôt l'huile rosée, était grasse et pas du tout crémeuse. Les pâtes étaient ordinaires. Mes collègues avaient pris de la pizza et de la salade ceasar. Ces mets semblaient plus réussis que mes pâtes.
Normalement, le menu en table d'hôte est bon et vaut la peine. Allez-y avec les quelques choix disponibles sur ce menu pour une valeur sûre."}
{"text":"Looks very fancy from outside but actually affordable. I ordered Bavette steak which I didn't like the slightest. It was very chewy and rubbery and not much flavorbto be honest. The vegetables and mashed potatoes were mixed together and I found it really gross. I think the chef did this to prevent me from knowing how flavorless the vegetables were. The least I expected was salt pepper and butter on the vegetables but no, I got my entire mashed potato mixed with my bland veggies. The steak was put on top of the veggies which made the veggie even less appetizing. Some of my friends took Pastas and their experience wasn't as distasteful as mine so maybe ordering pasta would have upgraded this review to a three star."}
{"text":"The description says italian restaurant, but the inside feels like an american style restaurant so it was a bit confusing. I had the gigi and it was delicious. The portion is pretty decent and there were a lot of pancetta in it. 

The staff is nice and the service is quick. The location is a bit odd: you need to go inside the sunlife building to find the entrance."}
{"text":"This restaurant is bizarre. Its inside a business building, but there is a \"patio\" where you can side on the sidewalk if you want to. The decor is drab, but at least its very clean. It seems like it caters only to the business men who work in the building. The waitress was very sweet, but I felt very badly for her because she was being harassed by a table of drunk men. The owner (?) did NOTHING to stop it. We were the only table eating inside besides said drunkards. The salads we ordered were fresh and actually delicious. Nothing special, but good. Over all I would 100% skip this place. Its not worth it. The atmosphere is cheap sports bar trying to be classy. It had more of a banquet space feel. On the way out one of the drunk men mocked us and said lewd things. Not amused. I gave two stars because the salads were edible and fresh and the adorable waitress did nothing wrong. PS don't let the website fool you like it did us . . ."}
{"text":"This classic american restaurant has a hidden entrance within the SunLife building. They also offer catering. Burgers are delicious. More details to come :)"}
{"text":"I actually stop by very often to have lunch or even supper when I work late. Peroni is my friends and I to go place. Very friendly staff.  You won't be amazed by the menu but the food is good. I like the fact that it's always quiet. Affordable price."}
{"text":"Located in the historic Sun Life building, this restaurant caters mostly to workers in the area and is an ideal place for lunch or supper and perfect if you need to reserve for groups.

My company has had many events at this location and we have organized large group lunches and found that they cater very well. Service is fast and accomodating. The servers and kitchen staff must be used to dealing with business people who are on a limited lunch break therefore the food is always timely.

I have sampled a variety of their appetizers, wings, pizza, pasta, salads and sandwiches and everything is always good. The wings are well seasoned and very moist, the portions are generous and really you couldn't ask for much more in terms of pricing and quality.

We even had a private breakfast buffet here once and the basic egg/bacon/sausages were delicious.

The only drawback of this restaurant is the interior. Overall decor and location is a little odd, it is very dark inside and reminds me of a pub more than an italian restaurant.

If you are in the area and want a good lunch that is not fast food, I would still definitely recommend it."}
