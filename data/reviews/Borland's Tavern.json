{"text":"Just thought I'd post an update, since we found ourselves in Belleville again recently.

It was early - 4:30 - and they were just opening.  Empty except for a few early-bird elderly couples and a person getting take-out.  But within 30 minutes, the place was full.  Lots of people waiting for take-out, bar area full, dining area full, and a line a dozen deep waiting to be seated.

Fish was again excellent.  Yummy cole-slaw (even my dining companion admitted it *was* very good despite his preference for larger pieces).  He said the shrimp were even better this time."}
{"text":"Waited 30 minutes for a table on a Friday night at 5:30. That is understandable for a fish fry. We then waited 45 minutes for our fish dinner. The fish was ok but disappointed with other people rating at 4.5 stars. Price was reasonable but will not go back."}
{"text":"This place has a delish fish fry, with a down home feel.  Usually my BF and I are city dwellers, but we will make it out to Borland's for Friday  fish fry on occasion.

I did feel a little uncomfortable, and like an outsider when we were there.  Definitely not a place that sees many fashionista's or women in heels! 

I am like 99% sure they only take cash too, so something to remember on your way.."}
{"text":"This has been our go-to for fish frys for over a year now as the food is really good (the breading isn't too heavy), the prices very reasonable, and we appreciate the community-feeling there. Unfortunately the service the past few times has been lacking, three out of the last four times we've seen waitstaff chatting among each other or with other customers without checking back after we've finished and have been waiting over 15 minutes for the check, or as was the case this past Friday, a half an hour for our food (it usually takes 15 minutes at the most, and the table next to us came in later with twice as many guests and received their food in 10 minutes). We'll still likely continue to visit, but we may consider ordering to-go."}
{"text":"Best darn fried chicken there is no comparison!! A must visit if you are anywhere near Belleville!"}
{"text":"This is a cash or check only Tavern!! Great fish fry and awesome cheese curds. Local, small town, WI farmer type culture. Welcoming, bright bar and banquet hall style dining area. Come for the food and small town charm."}
{"text":"Friday night fish and Saturday night chicken at Borland's Tavern in Belleville, Wisconsin is not only a hidden secret in Dane County, it is a right of passage for those who are in the know. This is an amazing no nonsense place to eat on Friday and Saturday night. Cost is cheap and the food is divine. It is arguably the best Friday night fish fry in the area. Be sure to order a glass of Squirt with your meal and enjoy drinking it in one of their 5 oz. glasses. And end the meal with a hot (and I mean HOT) fudge Sundae. The staff in this place is always friendly and the decor, while dated and kitschy, is exactly what some restaurants in Chicago spend thousands of dollars to emulate. At Borlands, though, like the food and the friends, it is 100% genuine.

And I think Jen M. from Oak Creek (see her review below) is a troll. And if she's not, she can go suck a lemon because I have never, ever experienced what she is describing and I can't count the number of times I've eaten at Borland's. It is quite literally in the hundreds."}
{"text":"Great Friday night fish fry and even better yet is the Saturday chicken. No frills No muss No fuss just good food at a very reasonable price.This is Wisconsin at its finest."}
{"text":"Borlands was our family Friday supper go-to place in the 60's & early 70's when I grew up in Madison. I recall when a fish fry supper was 63 cents, you read that right, sixty three cents. From other reviews,  sounds like it hasn't changed, except prices- a good thing. I wonder if they still have the 1950's style metal tables. Back in the day, Wisconsin  was all about big bars and this is one. Step in and you'll be in the 60's, sans the smoking in the restaurant  area. I'm in a wheelchair now, wouldn't be able to navigate the front steps or I would drive from Milwaukee tonight to step back to a simpler time. Don't pass up a chance to eat here, especially for \"fish Friday., and a brandy old fashioned sweet."}
{"text":"Good old fashion stuck in the 70s bar with decent fish on Friday night. The best reason to visit this place is Saturday night fried chicken. No ne does fried chicken as well as Borlands does."}
{"text":"We noticed there were black greasy specs on all of our glasses after we ate our food.  We went up to ask the staff about it and one woman said that they knew about the problem.  It is on all the serving ware put into the dishwasher.  They got a new dishwasher and everything now has black, greasy, specs on it.  They said they were told that the chemicals in the dishwasher are eating the rubber hoses and leaving the specs.  They said they tried different things to remediate the problem but were told to get a another new dishwasher.  But the staff said they just bought one, implying they were not going to pay for another one.  The staff had the audacity to seem annoyed when I pushed further after they already said they knew about the problem  
I do not know how long they have been serving their customers greasy black specs, seemingly made of chemically eroded rubber pieces, but that is disgusting.  And the fact that they were very well aware of the problem was more disturbing.  This needs to be investigated and the Dane County Public Health has been called.  It is very clear that eating chemically eroded anything is not healthy and against public health policy.  I feel extremely disturbed that this could be let go, and my eating of chemically eroded rubber pieces was taken so lightly.  What else could they have been letting go, that may not be so obvious, if they don't seem to have a problem serving their customers greasy black chemically eroded rubber specs?"}
{"text":"Stay away unless you are willing to get spoiled forever by there amazing fish fry.  In fact don't even come into Belleville on fridays because they lure you for miles around with the amazing aroma.   Seriously though.  Don't let the line bother you.  It seems crazy long but they turn tables fast and it's worth 10 or 15 minutes.   The best coleslaw anywhere ever.  I don't even like coleslaw but I'd eat there's by the plate full."}
{"text":"The place where the locals go. Excellent Classic Wisconsin fish fry and amazing bar burgers.  Good luck trying to get in for dinner on Friday night!"}
{"text":"While staying at a friend's farm in Belleville, Wisconsin, he mentioned Friday Night Fish Fry. My Californian friend and I raised our eyebrows and asked, \"Friday night what now?\"

Needless to say, we had to experience this Friday Night Fish Fry.

On the way there, the concept was explained to us. For those unfamiliar with Friday Night Fish Fry, here's a quick 411:

The Fish Fry is a classic Wisconsin tradition that originates from the state's Catholic settlers strictly adhering to the whole no meat on Friday rule. Soon, restaurants and pubs would be using the Friday Fish Fry concept as a marketing ploy to get patrons into the door. This is what led to the statewide phenomenon where everyone hits their favorite tavern for some fried fish every Friday.

As for Borland's, aside from being a real, living, breathing piece of precious Americana, the food is good. It's pretty standard fried fare, so I think Borland's charm lies more in its nostalgia.

Like one reviewer mentioned, it's not really a place that sees a variety in customers. In fact, as we lined up for a table, we bumped into Grandma! Yes, the actual grandmother of the friend we were staying with. And I tasted Grandma's cookies, so I know she knows how to do things right."}
