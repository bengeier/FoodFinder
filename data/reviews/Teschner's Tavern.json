{"text":"It might not be the prettiest place but the service was friendly and the food was awesome. Tried the sauerkraut balls and the Brandy burger WOW!!! Caramelized onion and mushroom in blackberry brandy and Swiss cheese. It's as good as it sounds!"}
{"text":"What a 'find'!
Stopped in on a rainy, crappy Saturday evening, and the place was packed. We grabbed two bar seats and ordered drinks. Just then a bartender walked by with two ENORMOUS burgers with knives jammed into the top and crinkle fries. We got the menus and saw that this was their usual-sized burger. The menus was extensive for such a small place, but we were assured by the guy sitting next to us that everything was great. He didn't lie. My wife ordered the smaller bacon cheeseburger and I ordered the 'Pammy' Melt with a side of onion rings. I could barely finish half of my perfectly-cooked, extremely flavorful burger. My wife commented that even the bun was fantastic (so was the marbled rye)!
Prices are amazing, and the dive-bar ambience adds to the fun. We will be back."}
{"text":"Friendly, laid-back small town tavern. Very solid burgers. Wish I could have stayed longer. If I lived in the area, I'd probably be a regular."}
{"text":"Don't let the appearance of this dive bar deter you- Teschner's serves one of the best burgers we've ever tasted! They are so good, we swear they sprinkle them with crack (lol)! The patties are massive and cooked to perfection with a flavoring we just can't put our finger on... The green beans are also to die for! We love the quick wit of the bartenders who always keep things interesting :) And don't forget to try the secret sauce..."}
{"text":"Love the food selection with great price and great service! Super friendly staff. Great place to catch a football or basketball game."}
{"text":"This is the perfect dive bar: awkward layout, wood paneling everywhere, cheap can/bottle beer with a local brew on tap (today was Akron's own Mucky Duck), super friendly server/bar tender, fun locals sitting next to you at the bar, and unexpectedly great food. Our guy behind the bar shared some of their house made mustard for the bar pretzel rods and it was delicious.  It's a tasty combo of a sweet honey mustard with the kick of horseradish.  Their pierogies are from right down the street at Pierogies of Cleveland (POC) so you can't go wrong with that. And the best of the day was the mac n' cheese burger. The kind of delicious that you can't stop eating it even when you are busting at the seams full."}
{"text":"We were airbnbing around the area and stopped inside. Very friendly staff, speedy service , great food. Happy overall"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best wings in NE Ohio!  It had been awhile since we have been there and I forgot how awesome the wings are. The best!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great family owned operated place with a surprisingly diverse menu and great drinks. The specials are always great! The wife and I love this place!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is always excellent, and prepared just the way you like it!"}
{"text":"My wife and I found this place on the yelp app and went to it with just the recommendations. We were not disappointed!  I had a burger that was cooked exactly as requested. We shared an appetizer and soup/salad and again were completely satisfied. Service was also exceptional. Atmosphere is quaint and inviting. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Excellent fresh food. Great burger, coleslaw, etc.  The mojito was fresh mint from their garden was perfect.  Small place, more of a bar. Food is great, service is good."}
{"text":"Awesome place!! Great food! Friendly staff.  If you're looking for a great place in Richfield they'll make you feel welcome."}
{"text":"Great burgers and great service. We were even offered a free slice of cheese cake to top things off! Nice and easy stop on the way back from Cuyahoga Valley."}
{"text":"Bob and Ann's.  That's what Teschner's Tavern was called, back in the Dark Ages of my drinking life, when a shot and a beer was about as exotic as it got, when Ann flipped burger at the grill, and Bob held court at the other side of the bar, on a stool, and laughed his low, chugging smoker's laugh at any tired joke proffered by one of the permanent fixtures seated on the other side.  Deer heads, dogs playing poker in velvet, sticky floors, but damn, could you drink all night for five bucks.

These days, it has even less charm, locked in the struggle between updating the atmosphere and decor to circa 1985 and saying, \"Aww, screw it.  People come here to drink, they will always come here to drink.  Why bother?\"

I'm told they serve food here.  Pool table.  Seating/bar/restroom layout that defies logic or explanation.

As a local watering hole, dive bar, cheap drunk place, it gets four stars.  If they would please turn the music down, somewhere below ear-bleed level, that would be swell.  One recent night we stopped in on our way elsewhere to grab a drink.  Two guys at the bar were working way too hard to get the two women working that night to meet them later.  I was tempted to take over bar duties so the four of them could get a room down the road at Terry Point Motel (rooms furnished, or unfurnished, by the night or by the week).  One star off for general creepiness, and young, puffy jugheads on the never-ending trail of tears.  Get me the hell out of here."}
{"text":"Family owned and run. The food is well-made and reflects pride of ownership who do most of the cooking. Very friendly and accommodating staff. Excellent homemade specials. We are locals and eat there often. The interior could use some updating but don't let that keep you away from the food."}
{"text":"Found this place by looking at Yelp reviews.  Stopped in last Saturday.  Got a place at the bar and the server guy served us super fast!  They have a decent beer selection and cover all the bases as far as liquor goes.  They also have Keno.  After about 15 minutes we were chatting with servers, patrons and it was like a party!  Very laid back and nice.  Dont get that up in Tremont....the place can be PACKED and people only talk to the select few they came in with.  Why bother to go out...stay at home and drink.  Didnt try the food but will be back VERY soon to hang with these folks again.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place on the way to do some climbing at Whipp's Ledges.  We'd planned to grab a bite to eat at Whitey's, but learned that they wouldn't be serving food until 4 pm.  So we took off in the car and ended up at Teschner's Tavern, which looked from the outside to be an absolute hole in the wall.  

When we walked in there was only one other patron, a guy sitting at the end of the bar sipping on a drink.  I asked if the kitchen was open and was told that it absolutely was.  The menus were given to us, and I was quite impressed with the selection of food available.  I asked what was \"good o order today\" and the bartender told me that I should order the Mac 'n Cheese, and ask for bacon and diced tomato in it.  She told me this was \"f***ing good\", so I decided with a testimonial like that I should go for it!  This dish was $3.95.  I also ordered a mini cheeseburger which was $1.50.  My boyfriend ordered the chicken philidephia sandwich and onion rings.  After we put in our order, we decided to sit at a table instead of the bar, as it had a direct view of a gorgeous flat screen TV where we could watch the start of the OSU game.  

A few things that kept this restaurant from getting 4 stars were observed as we waited for our food.  1) ambiance- basically this place has none of it, but that isn't really what we were looking for. 2) service- again, not really any service.  The cook pretty much was in the back cooking and occasionally came out, the bartender was chatting with the now 2 patrons at the bar.  We were the only 2 guests.  She did bring my a whole pitcher of soda to the table, but my boyfriend's water never got refilled.  3) the first beer my boyfriend ordered was at the end of the keg.  She gave him that 1/4 pint anyway, for free, but it was kind of gross with a bunch of floaties in it.

But then... came the food.  It was AMAZING.  Nothing at all that I would have expected coming from a place like this.  Everything tasted like it was freshly made.  I felt like I was at my grandma's house.  Flavor, flavor, flavor! My Mac 'n Cheese was so creamy and cheesy and gooey.  The tomato and bacon with it really DID make it f'in good. My \"mini cheeseburger\" was about the size I would make a regular burger on the grill at home.  And it tasted just like something my dad would have delivered to my plate, like the ground beef had just been pressed into a patty immediately before it was fired up, nothing processed or frozen.  

My boyfriend's chicken Philly was a bit surprising. It was on a regular bun instead of a hoagie roll, and had an actual chick breast on it.  Again, this reminded me of going over to Grandma's and she threw this together with what she had in the kitchen at the time.  The onion rings were also phenomenal.  My grandpa had a fryer when I was growing up, and would slice up some thick onions, bread them, and throw them in.  These tasted just like Grandpa's.  

The lady who was cooking when we were there, Michelle, loves to cook and it comes across clearly on the plate.  Our lunch was excellent.  If I'm ever in that area again, for a walk of for climbing, I am absolutely stopping in at Teschner's for a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Great food  brandy burger  was awesome. They have a special mustard sauce makes you wanna  clap your hands"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this small, local watering hole! Inside it's very out dated but comfortable. Long wooden bar, large open dinning room and friendly staff. I was pretty excited to see that they had Mucky duck brewery on tap, which I've never seen anywhere. Also, if you want domestic, the prices are very desirable. They make a homemade mustard that they serve with pretzel rods and my friends were very impressed and took a sample home. The food was very tasty. I got a burger topped with homemade Mac and cheese. I've had a burger made this way more than once and I must say this was my favorite version. We also tried the pierogis, which were cooked well and also tasty! It's absolutely a place I would return for a cheap beer and a quick, delicious bite!"}
{"text":"Best place to get great food, at a good price. Amazing staff ( Carly took great care of us ). Cheap tab... Go here when your in town!!!!"}
{"text":"I have driven past this pub and always wanted to stop.  Finally, we did! So glad because it was great.  I had a delicious burger (brought half home because it was so big) and my husband had the fish fry...Lake Erie Perch. It was perfect!  Server/Bartender was Stephanie and she took great care of us.  Can't wait to go back!!!!"}
{"text":"I like this place despite it's shortfalls.
The day we visited was a warm summer's eve happily we sat right next to the solo 5000 BTU air conditioner that was faced with the daunting task of cooling a bar full of patrons on a 90 degree day.  It was not up for the task.  It was the by-product of the digital age and throughout the course of dinner I watched as the thermometer reading inched it's was to the 80 degree mark.  When it hit that mark I just excused myself and went to my air-conditioned car to await my dining companions reaching the same level of discomfort.
The food? My steak salad was a nice looking but chewy chewy to the point of almost gagging when trying to swallow a particularly stubborn bit, my wife was sixes on her wings, and thumbs down on her cucumber salad which was over-dilled and over-sweet to her palate.  Our companions love this place in any temperature, and seemed enjoy their wings and burgers and mozzarella sticks with relish.  Service was challenged in large part to the Friday P.M. rush. enough so that when the bill appeared all on one tab we just had them split it between two cards evenly and booked for cooler climes."}
{"text":"This place has fantastic food.  I've never had a bad meal here and I've had many.  It's doesn't matter what you order because it will be good.  The burgers are probably my favorite bar burger anywhere.  They are fresh, flavorful, and massive.  This is a dive bar so if you're looking for fancy this isn't you place, but the service is usually prompt and friendly.  The bar staff is easy to strike up a conversation with.  I would have given this place five stars if it was updated but I'd rather it stays the way it is and keep the cost lower.  The food and drinks are priced fantastically for what you get.  Don't judge this book by its cover, stop and have a meal and you won't regret it."}
{"text":"This place is great. It's a neighborhood gem with great food and a no frills atmosphere. The burgers are the size of your head and fantastic, awesome wings and apps as well as specials. I was tempted to give a poor review just so no one else would find out about this hidden gem but they don't deserve it."}
{"text":"My favorite dive bar.  There tacos are amazing - only available on Tuesday.  They also have great burgers, perogies, etc.  There beer is always cheep, and the servers are always friendly.  The inside isn't that great, but who cares.  I feel comfortable bringing my kids here for dinner on a regular basis."}
