{"text":"BEST FOOD EVER!!!! Their chicken w/ broccoli is to die for. A bit of a hole in the wall tho..."}
{"text":"First timer at First Wok and we were very pleased! The service was fast and very friendly (The friendliness alone would keep me coming back since that seems like such a rare occurrence these days). But the food was also very good. Served super fresh, steaming, and delicious! It did not taste like frozen, reheated junk, rather fresh and made to order! The portions were good and the taste was excellent. We will definitely make this a new \"go to\" Chinese place."}
{"text":"Nice, big portions! My order is always correct. I've been a customer for 14 years. Try the Singapore mei fun."}
{"text":"First Wok's your typical Chinese take-out restaurant: greasy, run-of-the-mill, one-dimensional food with monosodium glutamate overload to boot.   Last time around, the person at the counter, probably the owner, seemed to be in a particularly grumpy mood. Maybe she was just having a bad hair day?  On the upside, at least I didn't end up with an upset stomach after eating their chicken lo mein. So there's that.   Overall, at best, First Wok's worth 2.5 stars but I will be generous and round it up 3."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. It's tucked away next to the County Market in Urbana (I drove around looking for it and almost missed it), and it was hopping when I was there (I think a Thursday evening around 6 or 7). They have a full takeout menu and then on the side of the wall they've stapled cardboard to the wall and written specials on it. I don't know how often these change, but they are very reasonably priced ($4-6 and come with rice). I ordered the subgum wonton soup and the hunan vegetables (special). The subgum wonton soup was huge and had vegetables, plump wontons, the most tender white meat chicken I've ever had, slices of roast pork, and big succulent shrimp. The broth was very nicely flavored and I will definitely get it again. The hunan vegetables had snow peas, baby corn, water chestnuts, carrots, broccoli, peppers, and tofu in the delectable hunan sauce (my favorite). This food fed me for two meals, and could feed anyone with a normal appetite more. I will be back many many times."}
{"text":"Food at First Wok is delicious and comes in a large portion. My favorite dish is \"House Special Angel Hair\" that comes with shrimp, chicken, and bbq pork. I also love \"General Tso's Chicken\" because the chicken is crispy and the sauce is just well-balanced. Just call before leaving home, and never have to wait upon arrival. Great value!"}
{"text":"I called in my order and it was done by the time I got there about 10 minutes later.  Very fast and efficient- It's fast Chinese food but it's better than the Panda Express type places.  I enjoyed the crab rangoon especially.  Make sure to ask for sweet and sour sauce if you order the crab rangoons as it is not assumed."}
{"text":"This is our go-to take-out place while Cravings is down for the count. They're great for the value, and their food is really tasty. It's your standard Chinese take-out...not too much to say about that! Their egg rolls are a little dry, but overall its a tasty choice for this part of town."}
{"text":"I'm so glad Yelp has added verbal descriptions for the star system as, \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" perfectly sums up my feelings. I got something marked \"spicy\" on the menu and barely felt any heat, nor tasted any seasoning. It wasn't a terrible experience, but judging from many of the other reviews here, I expected better.  **Update** So I gave the place a 2nd try (orange chicken) a few months ago which didn't turn out to be that bad, not great, but not bad.  I went there again today, ordered the szechuan chicken and was very dissapointed.  Yet again, supposed to be spicy, yet just tasted like MSG gravy, no flavor, no spice, just umami and cornstarch.    I'm guessing that there are probably dishes that aren't bad, but so far, all I've gotten was bland.  That coupled with the abrupt, bordering on rude woman who works the front desk and I'm not sure if I want to find out what those decent dishes are."}
{"text":"Very good food and fast delivery! I ordered something that was no longer on their menu, but they still made it for me! Their hot & sour soup is the best my husband and I have ever had at any other restaraunt!!! Will definitely order from them again if we are in the area!"}
{"text":"I just realized that I have been eating here for years, driving from the other side of town even, but I had never written a review.  Well here it is.  I have gotten food from First Wok for the last 8 or 9 years, on a regular basis, and I can't remember a time where I was not happy.  I lived in Chicago for 6 years, but came back to visit family a lot and always made sure to get it while I was here.  The pot stickers are like 4 or 5 bucks and they are enough for a meal for one.  They have your typical fried appetizers and they are not greasy.  I am not going to try to remember every dinner or lunch that I have ordered, but they were all good.  It is totally worth going to sunnycrest to get it."}
{"text":"This is a nice little Chinese take-out place. Although it does offer dine-in service, most of their business comes from take-out. The food is good, and the portions are big. It is not the type of place to drive across town to go to or take a date to, but for a quick cheap meal it is a great place to call in an order to or stop into on the way home."}
{"text":"There was a First Wok where I used to live and the Beef and Broccoli combo was my favorite! When i moved here I was so happy to see a First Wok! The Beef and Broccoli wasn't as good as the one I was used to but the egg rolls are freakin' awesome. The General Tso's was really good here also! Cheap, quick, and delicious if you get the right thing!"}
{"text":"Fast Chinese Food: 4.5/5 Service Quality: 2/5 I have never had an issue with the food, and usually go with the General Tso or Sweet & Sour chicken. The food is quick and if you're really hungry, add in the crab rangoon. It's delicious. The only downside of the restaurant is the service quality. The employees will always be brief/short, and as long as that doesn't bother you (I've grown to accept it) you're good to go.  (Quality & proximity outweigh the brief negative service interactions)"}
{"text":"Little disappointed here, Chambana Yelpers! I read some awesome reviews for First Wok, and Husband and I were super excited to try it out. We ended up there for lunch yesterday.  So, first thing - their fried rice is saffron yellow.. but I guarantee there's no saffron in there. Ack. It's seriously neon.  I ordered the eggplant chicken special. I was very excited after recently having some excellent garlic eggplant from Green Jade. I thought, \"Yay! Eggplant Special! Happy Grace!\"   As it turns out, I celebrated a bit too soon. The eggplant wasn't thoroughly cooked, making it sort of bitter and tough. Also, they didn't use Chinese eggplant, which was sort of confusing. It was American (globe) eggplant. If it had been Chinese eggplant, I bet it would've tasted a whole lot better. Furthermore, it was advertised as 'spicy.' Ahem. That dish was not spicy in the least. It could've used a few hearty splashes of sriracha. (Coincidentally, that's what I plan to do to the leftovers...) I also got egg-drop soup, which was alright. However, I got some fried noodles with my soup, and was even further disappointed. They were stale and not very good. On the plus side, Husband's duck and broccoli special tasted excellent! The duck wasn't deboned in the least, and seemed like it had just been hacked apart, but after working around the bones, the taste rocked.  The service was fast and friendly enough, and the prices were very low - both of us got specials and I got my soup for $12 total. Still, I don't think I'll be back. There are better Chinese food places in C-U."}
{"text":"Fast service, good prices, clean, and the food seems good.  Of course, I'm no expert on Chinese food.  I have heard people rave about Italian restaurants that I, as an Italian, find lacking; so I suspect that someone of Chinese ancestry might think First Wok falls short.  Take that as a caveat.  Anyway, I like their egg rolls and boiled dumplings.  The crab rangoons don't impress.  Their hot and sour soup is good.  Gentle kick to it.  I often get Pork Lo Mein and enjoy that.  Servings are ample.  The General Tsao Chicken is good, as are all the entrees I have tried.  The usual unappetizing photos of their dishes adorn the wall.  I often wonder about those photos.  A friend living in Taiwan sent me a cookbook that was popular there and it contained the same quality photos of the food.  Curious.  The menu lists a plethora of items and the wall has posted another list of dozens of entrees.  What these all are escapes me and there is often a language barrier when asking for an explanation.  Sometimes I feel adventurous and plan to order something I never had before but I always end up going with something familiar.  For a sit-down dinner, I prefer Rainbow Gardens on Neil Street, but for a quick and satisfying Chinese dinner, First Wok should not disappoint."}
{"text":"This is really only one of two or three family owned (ie, non-fast food) restaurants in this neighborhood. They have to keep their prices low because there are not many people with money to spend. Good and bad. Good, because the prices are very reasonable. Bad because there is no incentive to improve the food quality because their main customer base would not pay nor likely appreciate it. That being said, their food is a good value, particularly the house specials. Their potions are quite generous. They are very fast. Their sauces lack variety though, and their fried rice is always a bit hard. I usually get their house special Angel Hair pasta which is enough for two people, or one with leftovers."}
{"text":"Cheap take out, a little bit too greasy.. nice portion sizes, but the quality of the restaurant has decreased a lot! I don't know if they rush cooking it to be fast but I rather wait for it to taste like it used to than it does now. Sometimes the food needs a bit more flavor. It's obviously not authentic Chinese food but it used to be better than it is now. Mongolian beef and beef brócoli are my favorite things from there."}
{"text":"This is the most awful Chinese food I have every eaten and goes to show that Americans will eat crap. I ordered orange beef. It tastes like shoe leather breaded and fried in 4-year old fryer oil. I probably will get sick off this. My stomach is already turning. What a waste of $11.40. My first and last time!!!!"}
{"text":"OMG! When it comes to Chinese takeout there is no better. I cannot count the number of times I have sat in some posh Chinese restaurant in LA fantasizing about First Wok. They have a ton of options (healthy too) and will customize your dish to your liking. Everything is good! Definitely try it!"}
{"text":"I have lived here in the CHAMBANA area for 20 years now, and this is the only place  I go to get great tasting, affordable Chinese cuisine. They don't waste their money in fadish decor but instead puts the money into providing fresh and quality produce and meat in your meals! Don't waste your money on restaurants with gaudy store fronts because their food can be a digestive hazard. Try FIRST WOK and experience a happy culinary experience."}
{"text":"Good food, cheap prices, and quick service. I normally go for the lunch specials or combinations specials. This is our go-to take out place around the office. The owners are very friendly. I highly recommend you check this place out if you've never been."}
{"text":"The food and service is excellent. I like the having the ability to dining at the restaurant if I so desire. There is a variety of appetizing food selections to choose from. Food items are reasonably priced. Great lunch menu as well."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese food place!  Hands down!  No other competition!  I usually get sesame chicken, or chicken n broccoli."}
{"text":"The quality of food is okay, just so so. But the best is that it is very cheap and super quick. No need to wait. Also close to my department"}
{"text":"Never gives total over the phone. Order is always ready fast.\"like scary fast\". No matter how many times I've asked or no matter how hard I emphasize that I like spicy! It never is!"}
{"text":"Yum, yum.  Big portions, affordable prices, excellent tasting....just the way Chinese food is meant to be.  And 5 minutes from my house."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem. Best Chinese food around. Mostly carry out but they do have a few tables. Carried out many times and dined in once. Have never been disappointed. Eat at least twice a week."}
{"text":"Food is awesome and prices are reasonable.  LOVE their Won Ton soup and the Hot and Sour Soup is to die for!  Fast and friendly service is great too!"}
{"text":"Pretty consistant.  Priced great.  Just wish they would give ya more than 1 packet of hot sauce when ya ask for it..lol"}
{"text":"Great food and properly packed for takeout.  Service (phone & order pickup) was meh, so probably not great for sit-down unless you don't car about service at all."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Probably the best bang for your buck than any restaurant in the area. I just got home from picking up my order and opened my food to see that I paid for 4 spring rolls and they gave me 7!"}
{"text":"Price is great, quick service, good food, good portions. In not so desirable neighborhood. Situational awareness!!!!!"}
{"text":"Although is very americanized chinese food, the taste is pretty good for the cheap price. Esp lunch, 5 bucks can get you lots of food.   Better for take out, not a lot of seating area."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the 1st time today, my brother recommend them. I have to say that this is the best Chinese place in the area. I order ham egg fo young combo with house fried rice, general's chicken combo with pork fried rice for hubby, fried wings and fries for the kids and a order of crab ragoon. Everything was on point! It's hard to find a place that makes good egg fo young sauce ( its all about the sauce!) and theirs was good.  The rice was slamming and so was the crab ragoon. The food is waaay better then China Mountain on St clair. Also the kids said the wing and fries were good as well. Oh I almost forgot about the egg rolls. Yum, get you some. I will be only ordering from them for now on."}
{"text":"Just another one of those takeout places... that ROCK.  Their salt'n pepper squid is delicious and their combination noodle soup is what sets this place apart from many other takeout places in the area.  I don't recall if the combination noodle soup is actually called that (Shi Jing Mien), but if you ask for the noodle soup with a mix of stuff in it, they'll know what you're talking about.  :P"}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan of First Wok.  Admittedly, I get the same thing every time: the pork egg foo young combination plate.  For $5.95, you get delicious egg foo young, pork fried rice, and an egg roll, enough to feed you for two or three meals!  Soooo good.  I also like their crab rangoon, which is crisp and slightly sweet, different than many I've tasted.  Maybe someday I'll branch out to try their beef with broccoli, soup, and angel hair specials?  Everything looks and smells so good there!  Note: This place doesn't accept credit cards, so be sure you have cash before you order!"}
{"text":"I thought this place was pretty average as far as Chinese food goes.  Decided to try it out because other reviewers mention the plethora of vegetarian options.  On the menu itself there are no more vegetarian options than most Chinese places offer.  However, they will vegetarian-ize most of the meat dishes (I got General Tso's Tofu).  That said, it was not the greatest tofu I've had--kind of mushy, sauce was a bit watery (...or oily...honestly I couldn't tell which).  It also was not spicy at all.  I'm sure they'll make it spicier if you ask, so if you like your food spicy you should probably request it.  My food tasted alright and was definitely a generous portion, plenty for leftovers.  Service was quick and the place looked clean.  The food was just very...average."}
{"text":"The perfect Chinese take-out restaurant needs to be three things: fast, simple, and consistent in its deliciousness. First Wok meets all three.  Speed is key.  I live a few blocks away, and when I make the decision to get Chinese food, I want that Chinese food right then.  First Wok is spectacular in this regard.  One call, a quick run-through of the items I want, and it's done.  This isn't the place you all if you want to hmm and hah through the options.  I've found it best to have everything planned out.  Usually they'll list your order back to you, but sometimes they won't.  Sometimes they'll tell you \"ten, fifteen minutes,\" but most of the time they won't.  But you'll show up fifteen minutes later and your food will be ready to go.  And that food will be delicious.  I always order the cashew chicken, the beef with broccoli, the beef lo mein, and some hot and sour soup.  They're all magnificent, in that greasy, inexpensive take-out way, and they're all good reheated for days and days.  On the downside, I will note that I have had the smallest of mistakes in my orders.  Once they left out the crunchy things that go on the soup. Another time they game me a small item when I had ordered a large. Nothing major, I was never overcharged, and these are the only such occurrences in close to three years of regular patronage.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Good chinese food. Quick, affordable and rash! Yumm"}
{"text":"Best ttakeout Chinese food in CU. We used to live in SE urbana and moved to NW Champaign. I just drove a half hour for this after craving it and it was an excellent decision. Eat here."}
{"text":"For the past eight years I've been getting Chinese take-out from this place with no issues. In fact, the food was so good that I raved to everyone about it. Unfortunately, my most recent visit ended differently. I noticed the food seemed greasier than normal, but ate it anyway because I've never had a problem with the place. Long story short, I wound up with food poisoning, and on my birthday, to boot.   On top of that, the staff was pretty unpleasant, which I've never experienced from them before. It's run by a husband and wife. The wife normally doesn't speak much, but the husband is always talkative and friendly. This time, the wife shushed me when I walked in the door because she was on the phone (I hadn't said anything...) and then some man who wasn't the husband asked what I'd ordered and grabbed it for me. When I paid and said, \"Have a nice day,\" he just completely ignored me and walked away.   Totally disappointing. Worst birthday ever. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Anytime I'm in CU I have their chicken fried rice and egg rolls!"}
{"text":"I'm always so happy when I get Chinese food here.  Probably not because the food is amazing, but because I'm just happy I have Chinese food and I rarely get take-out.  So mostly this is a five star review because I'm hungry and thinking about First Wok right now.  If you want decent Chinese food that is cooked to order and you want it fast, I think this might be the best place.  I usually walk in, place an order, grab some stuff from the grocery store, and the order is always ready when I get back.  For around $20 I get a bag of food that lasts me several meals.  The sautéed broccoli is a great thing to add into a larger order."}
