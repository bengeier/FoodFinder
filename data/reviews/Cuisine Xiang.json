{"text":"Came here with my girlfriend this sunday as we were tempted by some chinese food. We ordered the salt and pepper fried squid which was outstanding. We also got the beef with vegetables from the lunch menu. The prices are what you'd expect but the quality of the food is great. Good value, would reccommend doing take out though as the atmosphere pretty raw and boring..."}
{"text":"Delivery order, arrived quickly but the porc springs rolls were fried mini won-ton instead and The chicken plate I ordered was mistaken for another chicken dish. The Rice noodles and beef should have been named chop suey and rice noodle. It was disappointing we will not order from there again. The general Tao was okay but not very generous."}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times and was in yesterday for some take out. To my horror, the menu has been changed and significantly \"Westernized\". Gone is the Gong Bao chicken, wood ear mushroom salad, Yu Haising eggplant and pork with garlic stem. 

The food was still tasty and fresh, but I loved the authentic szechuan dishes that are no longer on the menu."}
{"text":"Everyone needs a good Chinese take-out join nearby and I got one. Fu Yuan offers great Canadianified Chinese food as well as a hidden menu in Cantonese only that offers authentic Chinese food. How authentic? I saw the cook taking apart an entire pig.

The steamed dumplings are delicious little pasta pockets of soup and hearty to. A plate of 5 dumplings will stuff you like a thanksgiving turkey. The rest of the whitey-Chinese food is also awesome even though not authentic. Shanghai noodles are a meal and a half, as with every other meal. The crispy beef isn't a huge nugget of breading with a tiny bit of meat, you can see the meat through the breading and they are fresh and tasty. I've been there more than a few times and never regret my meal. 

The restaurant looks spartan; decoration is not urgency here. Just tables, a giant screen TV playing Chinese television. Both menus are flavour explosions, service is OK, delivery is speedy. Local Chinese take-out acquisition complete."}
{"text":"An average Chinese restaurant. They offer not so authentic Chinese food. 
I came in a rainy day. The ventilation was off so  the smell is smoky and unpleasant. We ordered two dishes. They were ok. Portion was not big. The flavour was compromised to a North American taste. Rice was dry. I had to ask for water myself. 
The menu was not very attractive to 
me. Not coming back again."}
{"text":"This is not your typical westernized Chinese restaurant, they do have wonton soup, imperial roll, general tao chicken... But it's not their specialty. Their specialities are authentic real northern Chinese food. The kind that you will get if you are in China. So it might not be for everyone... 

I'm a chinese borned and raised in Canada, my family is from HongKong and my wife is from northern China. Lol so yea, I'm pretty messed up when it comes down to what Chinese food that I like lol. 

I like the food in general, especially the spicy dry cooked chicken (see picture).

My wife also pre-ordered a dessert, fried white egg with red bean. According to her, less and less people in China are willing to make it because of the long process (minimum 40 minutes)."}
{"text":"Verdun is continuing her streak at  becoming Montreal's new foodie haven!

Came here yesterday with a friend for dinner and was floored by the quality of the food, the taste and the price. Yes, the decor is quite spartan but when your mouth and tongue are living in Technicolor because of the flavors, who cares?

We ordered dumplings in hot sauce (almost a stew), green beans coated in red chillies and meat, and a sliced beef with tofu and chilli sauce (again, could almost be eaten as a stew) over rice. 

No joke, I broke out into a sweat because of the heat factor in the food, but this is the funny part. even though the food was spicy and hot, you could keep eating it, you didn't have to run for milk or yogurt to cool off the palate in order to continue eating, unlike some Thai and Indian places I've gone to, when the food is so bloody scorching, that you end up filling up with water instead of the food.

The lone waitress who served us, could neither speak very good English or French, but spoke some broken form of the two, but despite that, we were still able to understand each other, besides, she's really sweet and service is friendly, which is always a plus.

I'm going to become a regular."}

Farces à part, bien qu'il y ait le niveau \"un piment\" et \"deux piments\" à moins de vraiment, vraiment, vraiment aimé ça très, très, très épicé, choisissez la version \"un piment.\" Comme ça vous pourrez profiter des saveurs sans vous brûler l'sophage! Je n'ai pas aimé les dumplings aux arachides du tout, mais les fèves vertes ont été un coup de cur définitif! Le général tao est pas mal bon aussi et le buf épicé, bien, si vous avez lu jusqu'ici, vous savez qu'il est épicé! À prendre avec un grand bol de riz. À ma prochaine visite, j'espère avoir un ami qui peut lire le cantonnais pour me dire quels sont les spéciaux du jours sur le fameux tableau noir mystérieux!"}
