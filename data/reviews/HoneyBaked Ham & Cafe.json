{"text":"I came to this deli and cafe for my Birthday luncheon with my sisters and mother. It was a wonderful experience and I will definitely be back! Especially since on the bottom of the receipt there's always a code for  a buy one sandwich get one free.  The staff was outstanding! They treated us like VIPs. When I arrived the place was super clean. There was an employee at the counter who was smiling and seemed to be glad to have me as a customer.  They have a private room that is available for parties or other meetings. They opened that up to us which gave us privacy to talk and laugh for hours. We had some wonderful bonding time, because the environment was so relaxed and inviting.  After we ordered our food. They hand delivered it to our tables. How cool! It made me feel really special. I liked being pampered and the food... Oh Wow! What a sandwich! My sister Carrie said \"This is a real sandwich.\" That best describes.  My mom bought some turkey to take home she was so impressed! And the prices aren't any higher than a typical deli. But here's a little piece of advice. If you want to save some cash here fill out the survey on the drink counter and put it in the box. You will automatically get a free sandwich coupon sent to your email inbox. Then on your birthday you get another one. And you get a lot of other amazing deals. New favorite deli/cafe!"}
{"text":"The service here is always fantastic. I have tried several of the sandwiches and I liked them all (minus the mustard).  Today I had the BBQ Stacker.  My favorite is the turkey ranch because I like the multi grain bread better than the cibatta bread.  The cibatta seems dryer for some reason.  The sandwiches are no expensive at $6.99 each.  However, their ham is on the pricey side.  I have not had one of those yet but I hear they are really good."}
{"text":"I don't think this place knows what it wants to be. When you come in, you see tables that remind you of a sandwich shop. Then there are also coolers that remind you of a grocery store. You can buy sandwiches, salads, and soups and smoked or glazed hams and turkeys. I've never been to a place like it.   My girlfriend and I ordered 2 turkey sandwiches to go. The sandwiches were good, with a generous amount of turkey, but they took far too long to receive. We waited 20 minutes. Sandwiches aren't that labor intensive, but this place doesn't seem to have their processes down.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Good first impression.  Sandwich was very good.  I didn't order any of the extra sides but others in my group did.  They seemed small but I was told that they were good.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"HoneyBaked has by far the best turkey salad ever. And the ham is pretty good too. Who knew they catered??"}
{"text":"Brand new store.  Just opened this week.  Store looks great.  Samples of ham and ham salad with you walk in.  Tasted both, both were good.  Menu looks good, variety of sandwich and salad options.    Service was less than to be desired....It took the counter person about 5 minutes to get my order wrote down and rang up.  Clearly a lack of training and motivation.  Didn't know the menu items or was able to tell me what was on a sandwich without yelling over to the kitchen area.  Ordered a combo meal...Sandwich, 2 sides, and a drink.  Around $10-11.  Gave me receipt, told me to sit down and they would bring it to me.  About 10 minutes later a lady tries to bring me a sandwich, wasn't mine though.  A few minutes later they finally brought me the correct sandwich.  They didn't give me a drink cup when I ordered so I asked the lady for a cup, she said she would bring it right out.  She brought a cup right out, but gave it to someone else instead.  I was still without a drink.  Had to go to counter and wait 5 minutes to get someones attention to get cup.  Food:  Sandwich was a complete mess (I have a picture, I'll try to upload it.)  Some ingredients not even on the bread.  Definitely had to eat it piece by piece.  Presentation was not there at all.  It was very tasty though. Portion size of sandwich was good.  Sides:  Brocoli Salad and a Potato Salad.  They were both average.  equivalent to Walmart Deli.  Portion size was quite small.  It took me a good 40 minutes for lunch, not somehwere to go if you're on a tight schedule like I was.  Figured it would be much quicker since there were more employees than customers, but due to severe lack of training, and detail to customers, service was a terrible experience."}
