{"text":"No point in really writing this since Daviel B. sums it up pretty good. This place seemed cool and I was really excited to go.  That's as good as this is going to get.  From the beginning, there is no discernible host area so we walked in and wandered around trying to find someone to seat us.  There are two entrances, neither have a host stand or a sign saying something similar to 'wait to be seated'.    So I walked into one entrance and looked around.  Walked to the other entrance and looked around.  Went back to the first entrance, still nothing.  Finally had to stop a server walking wherever to ask how to get seated.  She said I was to find a lady with a green shirt outside to get a table.  This lady didn't have any kind of King and Mane shirt or anything that would make me thing she worked there.  Finally we found her outside and asked to be seated.  She sat us in the outside area.  This is where it got bad.  This is where I waited for a server to bring water, or maybe a menu, or silverware, or ask if I wanted a drink.  This is where the table to the left got seated and all of the above mentioned standard treatment.  This happened to two other tables.  About 15 minutes passed before I had to interrupt a server (who would stand in front of me to talk to the next table) if we could get some menus, etc.  The menu was very limited.  There is a daily item which is handy I guess, but besides that they have maybe 5 sandwiches and 5 entrees.  I got a BLT which was fine I suppose and my friend ordered nachos.  Before the nachos came, the server put an empty industrial sized can of jalapenos on the table.  She didn't explain that this was for the nachos.  I guess they need some sort of stage?  Either way it would have been nice for her to explain why what I thought was garbage was taking up half of our table.  The nachos came out wrong.  It was asked for no peppers and was covered in them.  That shouldn't happen.  Eventually the nachos were brought back out and it would appear that they were just picked off and reheated.  They were dry and the cheese was burnt.  This place is not a restaurant, its a bar and the menu reflects this.  The food is bland and overpriced.  The staff is clearly inexperienced and I cant even begin to imagine what is going on in that kitchen.  I won't be returning.  Also, the orange slice that came with my hacker pschorr looked like it had been run over by a car after it had gone bad."}
{"text":"The reviews were kind of iffy on this place but I'm glad I tried it.  I went for a birthday dinner with about 8 people - I called ahead and put in a reservation but the host said I wouldn't need one - I am glad I called, it was pretty busy.  Decent server, felt bad for her since she was the only one for every table in the place.  It took her a while to get to our table and come back for orders but it was understandable and once we got the wine, we were relaxed enough to not care.  Bottles of wine are perfectly priced, as is the food.  The food isn't great by any means, but it's good, and we weren't expecting 5-star quality.  I liked the nachos appetizer with chicken, and then I thought my steak tacos were good.  The rice and beans were just OK.   Overall I liked the atmosphere, the food, and the drink specials.  I went back a few weeks later with a few friends just to sit at the bar, and at 11 on a Friday night we sat right down.  The only beer special was $2.50 PBR pints (ha ha) but I really do like the atmosphere and the clientele isn't too bad.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"I would say this place was OK, but could use improvement. I went with my mom who was visiting from out of town, and my two friends. We were seated right away thanks to a very attentive host, then immediately greeted by a very friendly waitress.   Water, menus, and our drink orders came right away. However, my mother and one friend ordered margaritas and they never really were a part of the dinner after that. Much silliness ensued. Long distance phone calls were made. The conversation became bizarre. Our food came and I was quite satisfied with my dish-- Walleye. But we thought salad or soup should have come with our meal, which in total came to $95 with tip for four. Additionally, the salsa really should be made fresh. For tips, visit Taqueria Guadalajara, www.lataqueriaguadalajara.com/ --the best Mexican food I've had in town. To sum up, with some fresh salsa, some less alcoholic drinks plus salad or soup, this place would be perfect."}
{"text":"I usually try to write detailed reviews.  This particular review doesn't need much effort. Went here for drinks.  Drinks were unanimously awful. I'd wager that this place will be out by Winter."}
{"text":"I came here one night with some friends. It's new so why not try it out. It was initially disappointing. I felt like the hostess didn't know what was going on. She seemed to have a hard time gauging how long of a wait it would be. And she wasn't good at suggesting to get a drink at the bar. It didn't help that there's almost no space for waiting.  However, once we got seated, the place was totally fine. We got margaritas - not amazing. And as far as the menu goes, I had no idea what I was ordering. Turns out it was this huge sandwich - it had pork and an egg and a hot dog! Quite tasty, just a bit too much meat for me. My friend got a meatball appetizer that was also very good.  It's a bit sad to me that so many people seemed to have a bad experience here. I'm hoping it sticks around and get a little bit better about having people wait and get seated."}
{"text":"We were so excited to try out this new restaurant! Eek! Methinks not anymore.    We went in the evening with some out of town guests for dinner and asked our waiter for his recommendations for appetizers.  Basically he told us about all the \"filling\" things on the menu.  \"Try the nachos or the quesadillas\" he said, \"they are really filling!\" The aim of appetizers is not to fill you up. We were hoping he would recommend something more of the tapas sort than something we could easily order at a bar. Finally, we decided to get some chips and salsa, a couple glasses of sangria, and the meatballs.  The Sangria was watery. The chips were definitely from a bag. At a spanish/mexican restaurant in the capitol square we at least expected fresh tortilla chips, if nothing else. The salsa was good, and that's all there is to say about that. The meatballs were disappointing as well as they were bland and covered in cheese; that's to say, a waste of calories. We were so disappointed that we didn't want to waste our time any longer so we paid our bill, politely left and ate dinner elsewhere.   Sorry but we're never going back."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a delicious, very special meal 6/14. -Maybe others visited too soon? -No problem being seated, servers were very attentive. I had sea scallops with green onion mashed potatoes and a beef reduction sauce that was well-presented, perfectly cooked, unique and most important just yummy! -It was Mole Monday and my husband had a nice substantial meal of mole chicken, rice and beans. --What's wrong with having a somewhat eclectic menu? --The desserts -a delicate panna cotta and creamy lemon cheesecake were also stellar. -I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"We didn't have any food here but we did stop in for a pint and a Bloody Mary. Definitely the best Bloody Mary in town and probably the best I've ever had. The staff was great and very welcoming. Next time we're in Madison we will come back for sure."}
{"text":"I'd like to warn others to stay away from King and Mane. It will ease the sting of having wasted my time and money and taste buds there myself. It's overpriced bar-quality food at best, along with very lackluster service.  Can you imagine going to a restaurant and putting your entree orders in, only to be told about 35 minutes later that they are out of your entree for the night? It' can happen to you if you go to \"King and Mane.\"  The way to deal with this is to NOT order a different entree when they ask what else you'd like instead - if they can't get it together to notify you, if not WHEN you place the order, then within 10 minutes thereafter MAX that the kitchen is unable to fulfill this request - then they do NOT deserve any more of your business than what you have already had to give them just by being there and ordering what you have already reluctantly eaten.  We waited about an hour for our food, during which time no less than 3 different server changes were made on us mid-meal. We could never tell who was coming or going. When they did come to the table they failed to notice or address basic things like an empty beer bottle, and thus would have to be actively hailed down to request another drink. I don't normally drink the ice water served at restaurants but these are the sort of servers who would fail to ever refill your water glass.  They claim to be a gastro-cantina and that there is some sort of a Latin influence to the food, however it is just midwest bland bar food, with an inflated price. The only passable part of the meal was the Beet Salad with manchego and pistachios, however this came oddly accompanied with the only \"Latin\" thing the restaurant apparently offered (a pair of \"soft tortillas\" that were so dry and stale they could slice a jugular) Who is going to wrap this salad in these? Is the inclusion of the tortillas just there to justify the word \"cantina?\"  A side of broccoli was ordered that the menu describes as \"sauteed broccoli\" - one of the servers who took the order for this was specifically told by us that we do not like overcooked broccoli and she assured us that it would come out crisp and good. Sure enough, it was brought out (by a different server) as a disgustingly overcooked slop, but also drowning is a yellow puddle of cheap oil. It looked as if it had been boiled for an hour in water, drained, and then doused in a cheap corn oil from a huge tin can. Truly disgusting broccoli! Any chef knows how to do broccoli properly and any kitchen that sends obviously overcooked broccoli out to its customers is run by a poor chef, if he is even present. No one enjoys overcooked broccoli - it not like meats where there a range of acceptable doneness. In fact, if you are at a restaurant that has not yet proven itself to you to be good (EVEN if you have read a \"good\" review in Isthmus) and first order just a side of broccoli and (if you like) specify it to not be overcooked - and if they bring it out overcooked - refuse it and leave. The harder test is to not specify how it to be cooked - they should still bring it out NOT in an overcooked state - they should not have to be told this. The kitchen's missteps are only beginning there and you can get out without any investment this way. This should not be necessary but unfortunately in MADISON it is.  The Sea Scallops entree - which came out shortly after it was announced that the other requested entree was unavailable, leaving one person sitting eating an entree and the other unable to - was nothing special and was served only slightly above room temperature.  The \"Duck Fat Potato Pancake\" which one of the servers assured us would be good, was flavorless (I like to say \"flavor-free\") and to be honest seemed sodium-free.  The service from the three different young women was rushed, indifferent and included outright lies about the food, assuring us of things the kitchen could not or would not deliver on.  AVOID \"King and Mane\" (dumb name too) AT ALL COSTS or you will feel like banging your head on the loud approximately 2'x5' metal plate on the sidewalk next to King and Mane's outdoor seating that every passerby and the waitstaff clanks across if you are trying to eat outside."}
{"text":"This place gave me literally the worst service I have experienced to date. I was appalled. So much so we left before we even ordered.  Upon entry, our group of 5 was a little confused. There was no hostess and one lone waitress. After standing and looking stupid I asked the waitress if she could help us and she said sure, sit wherever you like.   We did and after a few minutes, another girl slammed some menus down in front of us, making sure to not say anything or make eye contact. She came back a few minutes later with water, again trying to set it down on our table as quickly as possible without speaking to us, greeting us, asking us how we are doing, telling us about the specials or making eye contact.   Finally someone at our table timidly said (since it was so apparent this girl was in a horrible mood) said \"Hello....how are you?\" She responded flatly \"OK.\" ........We said \"Ok?\" And she said \"Yep, OK.\" Then I asked if she was going to be our waitress (because if she was I was going to ask for another one.) She rudely shot back \"No, I'm just the hostess...\" and tried leaving our table. Someone else asked if she could tell us what the 3 plate special was for that night. She rolled her eyes, gave a big sigh and reluctantly started muttering something about how she didn't know, she wasn't sure, as she was staring off into the distance. Then she left.  We were all stunned at how she had treated us. Here we were, a table of 5, ready to spend money and looking forward to a nice meal. I'm not going to spend my money at a place that couldn't care less that I am there or make me feel welcome. We got up and the waitress asked what was wrong. I told her that the hostess girl was so rude we didn't want to eat there.   We walked to Nattspill and it was a complete 180 - we were treated like you should be treated. Greeted warmly upon entering, given menus - you know, the basics.  Don't waste your time here. They don't want your money anyway."}
{"text":"I was a bit apprehensive going to this restaurant in light of previous reviews, but was pleasantly surprised. I sampled a selection of the tapas offered. The albondigas were particularly good as was the queso fundido. The sangria was ok, certainly nothing to write home about. I liked the restaurant enough to go back at some point, though it's not at the top of my list. Restaurants in this price range that I prefer would include Sardine and Graze.  Bottom line: good, but not great."}
{"text":"Nachos & drinks were great; dinner not so much.  More of a bar than a restaurant, the seating area is very small compared to the bar area.  For example, there was only 1 waitress for the entire eating area.  Went here for dinner with friends.  We split a few bottles of wine and the nachos to start with.  The nachos were great and the wine was too (but you can't really screw wine up).  Unfortunately when it came to dinner the food was bland and just so-so. Still a fun atmosphere but not somewhere I would go to eat a full dinner again."}
