{"text":"It can be tricky to find home made food in a town like Vegas with all the chain restaurants but look no further! The food here is home made with flavor in mind! Everything on the menu is delicious! And to all thr carnivores who may be turned off by Ruse being Vegan, I challenge you to try it and see for yourself. This place might just change your perception. I'm not a Vegan, never have been and don't plan on becoming one. But good food is good food and that's what matters to me, And to top it all off the people at Ruse are awesome; down to earth, super nice and all around just real people! Looking forward to see the expansion of the menu and locations!!"}
{"text":"This place is truly amazing! In a town with lots of vegan options I am continually a customer on Wednesday at Bruce Trent Farmers Market. Super nice people and delicious high quality food. I'm in love with this place."}
{"text":"Yum! I am not a vegan but I welcome any chance to try new food. I ordered the spicy Italian sausage. The bread was perfect and the ingredients had so much flavor. The price was right and it was a good size too. I want to go again to try the other choices, and order the sausage again."}
{"text":"So I am on the Internet one day and see this vegan place is making vegan gyros and sausages. I lost my mind thinking about how good it was gonna taste. So they announce they are gonna be at the Farmer's Market on Vegas &Rampart which they are at every Wednesday from 2-8pm. I went right after work and let me tell you that they way exceeded my expectations! They vegan lamb gyro was so good I had to buy two and a sausage for my omnivorous friend who barely eats well. He loved it too and posted it all over the Internet. Anyway this place is amazing all the meals are $7 and under and honestly so delicious. Please try them they do two Farmers Market the one listed before and Sunday's at The Silverton Casino."}
{"text":"Love visiting Ruse whenever I have the chance! My favorite order are the tofu satay tacos, but the vegan lamb gyro and the vegan sausage & peppers were also delicious and super flavorful! Support your local food stand and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time last week at the Bruce Trent farmers market. I had the taco and falafel burger. They were both so good. The flavors were so spot on. For the last week I have been craving another taco so I will be going to the Silverton farmers market to get one. I'm excited to see more from them."}
{"text":"Ruse Vegan Kitchen is the new gem of Las Vegas! Not only is the staff and owner super friendly and inviting, the food is also incredible! Ruse has everything from falafel burgers, gyros, tofu tacos, and more. I have tried every dish and I am always surprised at the unique flavors and textures that Roo has curated. Her vegan lamb and sausage are approachable and pleasing to the tastes of meat-eaters and vegans! The dishes are all fairly priced and make vegan food accessible to everyone. Personally, the lamb gyro is my favorite. It is piled with well-seasoned vegan lamb, homemade toum, spicy harissa, and crispy fresh vegetables. This is vegan food that is satisfying without breaking the bank. You can be proud to support this passion project turned small business when you taste and feel the hard work that goes into each homemade dish. Find Ruse and farmers markets all around Vegas and you can't miss them because you can smell the lemongrass and coriander from down the street!"}
{"text":"Ruse has the best vegan gyro in town, hands town. I start salivating just thinking about this plant-based lamb gyro ($7). Ruse Vegan Kitchen has limited operating hours which you can keep up with by following them on Facebook or Instagram. They're at the Las Vegas Farmer's Market every Wednesday from 2-8pm and at Lovelady Brewing in Henderson on Sundays. So far, I've visited Ruse back to back on Wednesdays. 

There's about 4 options on the menu, to include tofu tacos, a falafel burger, and a chimichurri special. I would like to try all the menu options, but it's so hard to stray from the gyro when it's so damn good. Make sure to get the gyro spicy, by the way. It's actually very mild in heat. 

Good to know: As of now, Ruse does not sell beverages or sides.

{"text":"Great and friendly service and delicious food! I like regular lamb gyros and the vegan \"lamb\" gyro was very satisfying. Plus my gut and my conscience are feeling better than usual!"}
{"text":"I had the sausage which was amazing. And the tacos, which I loved. And the gyro which was the BEST! I hope to soon be able to rave about the falafel burger (I couldn't eat four meals in one visit). It's difficult for me to like food that doesn't have cheese on it so that makes how much I liked my three dishes all the more impressive."}
