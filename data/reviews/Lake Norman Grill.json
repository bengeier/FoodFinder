{"text":"Ordered their veggie burger and it was one of these frozen patties you can buy in bulk from the likes if Sam's Club.  Utter gash.  2 stars instead of one since the fries were passable."}
{"text":"There are much better burgers to be had and better food trucks out there but if you're hanging out at Primal and need some grub you could do worse. While we were there on a Friday afternoon specifically to try this place out and did not partake in some of Primal's offerings we had the bourbon burger and a regular hamburger. Ok, the patties are not their own handmade, the meat was just ok. The bourbon burger was relatively tasty with their sauce on two patties and an onion ring. The regular burger, well, it filled someone's need for food. All in all, would I go back for the food, nope. But if I was at Primal and needed something, ok I'd get a dog or wurst ... I hope they do well as the ladies serving were very nice and seem to be a permanent fixture at Primal."}
{"text":"The bourbon burger was the best burger I have ever had!! Originally from New Jersey and came to North Carolina to visit, and my friends brought my fiance and I to this brewery. I was hungry and contemplating on finding a pizza spot to get food on the way back home, but after discussion, I figured it would be easier to just get food at the food truck that was on the premises. I didn't have have high expectations, since most food truck places were a hit or miss from where I am from. I ordered the burger and was hoping that it would satisfy my hunger. The bourbon burger more than satisfied my hunger. Every one of my taste buds hit pure ecstasy with every bite that I took. This is my first posts on yelp; the burger was that good. I wish they made burgers this good in New Jersey. I will never look at Jersey burgers the same after having this little piece of heaven."}
{"text":"Had the brat on a pretzel bun. With a cold Pojo + picnic table = summer is here!  Great food. Great beer. Great environment.  Winner."}
{"text":"I am normally a pretty lenient reviewer. However after spending $30 tonight on dinner at this food truck which was parked at Primal Brewing I feel obligated to write a review to tell people to not order food from this truck. The food was greasy the bratwurst was mushy and overcooked, the cheeseburger was a tiny frozen patty which was then overcooked on a flattopp grill. We barely ate any of it because it was so gross. If only I could get my money back.  On a positive note, the beer at Primal is good."}
{"text":"Good little truck conveniently located just off the pavement by Primal Brewery on 115 in Huntersville. The brewery specializes in beer, the food truck does food: menu includes brats, dogs, burgers, and things that go with burgers, dogs, and brats. I requested a dog with pickle, red onions, relish, tomato wedges, and brown mustard + fries. Went inside got a beverage and soon after getting back outside and situated under a 'brella my food arrived. Charlie does a nice job of dishing it up Take some time and chat her up if the crowd is thinnish, she is charming and interesting, a genuine southern lady.  ...the cheese burger takes me back to a better place and time :-) when Jon and Angie served up Mill Burgers in Diamond Lake. Have it her way: seasoned beefs topped with cheese + onion + greens + tomato. Yea! comfort food..."}
