{"text":"The fries are incredible. Full of spices.  Now that the fries are out of the way, the chicken here is juicy and delicious. They have a very tasty spicy sauce that they serve with the chicken and fries that is a must for spicy food lovers.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Good place for a chicken sandwich. French fries are some of the best I have had in a while"}
{"text":"Great food but service is below average. I understand it's a family owned restaurant, but I'd appreciate if they didn't use the dining area as living room/office. I don't need to hear videos from their phone, nor watch the staff sitting on the chair so comfortably as if they're in their own living room. Service definitely needs a lot of improvement and proper training."}
{"text":"Amazing chicken probably the best in west island! A little pricey in comparison to other chicken places but well worth it."}
{"text":"Came here 3 times.  First time I loved it, but next 2 times didn't.   First off...please put a napkin in your bread basket! Can anyone wipe clean the dusty border next to the tables? You might wanna bring a sweater or hope to sit way in the back, away from the freezing entrance area (in winter) or away from the a.c. (in summer).  What about the food?  Large full plate! That's definitely great.  Half chicken with a salad (old lettuce)  with no dressing (?!) with some french fries. First time I ate these fries I thought these were the tastiest I had ever eaten. But then, last 2 times they were not seasoned enough...  The chicken NEEDS a side bowl of sauce or it is quite boring.  Waitress seems out of place...portuguese resto? At least they play portuguese music.   Thought I had found a good place, but it's not consistant.  Again, I'll need to go back downtown,  to places like Doval's.  Being clean, consistent and fresh is very important in the restaurant business.  This place just isn't."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and I'm never disappointed.  I tried the Cod this time around.  It was the best salted cod dish that I've had since my mom use to make it.  It was amazing.  I went with a large group and they accommodated us nicely.  We actually took up most of the restaurant. Second time with a large group and they do handle this nicely.  While preparing tons of take out order.  People just kept coming in to pick up a big bag.  This is always a good sign.  I have gone several times with very small groups too.  Never disappointed.  Their hot sauce is Amazing!! As are their French Fries.  All is really good."}
{"text":"Consistently good Portuguese chicken at a very reasonable price. My go to place when we're in the mood for Portuguese chicken, only problem is its a bit out of the way."}
{"text":"Toute premiere visite.  Plusieurs personnes me disaient que je devais y aller.  Il y avait 3 types de vins blancs sur la carte.  Nous avons mangé  l'assiette de poitrine de poulet et le sandwich au poulet. Les deux assiettes sont servies avec d'excellentes frites maisons et une salade verte. Pour ce qui est de ma poitrine de poulet elle avait beaucoup de goût mais pas beaucoup de chair autour de l''os. Mon invitée à beaucoup aimé le sandwich au poulet.  Il est à noter que le mercredi la deuxième assiette est 1/2 prix. Un petit bémol seule le service. Il y avait 3 tables , la serveuse était très gentille mais portait plus d'attention à son ordinateur personnel sur une table que sur le service."}
{"text":"Delish...busy..call ahead but be close because they are super fast!!  This place fills the parking lot in DDO on weeknights between 5-6. If you need to go to the neighbouring Jean Coutu be prepared for no parking.   And with good cause...you are feeding a family for around 25$...chicken, salad, fries..tasty. and I don't love chicken.   Great piri sauce..my kids mix it with mayo to dip their tasty fries.   Bonus..the chicken comes cut in portions. Often they toss in extra bits when a full chicken is ordered. Apparently Tuesday nights they have specials.   I had the chorizo bun..there was enough extra bread for another family..and so good!@   Ambiance inside is typical mall resto..but the workers are so nice!!"}
{"text":"Not worth it ..chicken was burnt and dry Bread was frozen in the middle  Cote st Luc BBQ chicken orSt Hubert much better"}
{"text":"What a gem of a find! This is a tiny, no-frills spot in a strip mall that you might pass by without a second glance. Then you smell the food grilling! The specialty is chicken covered in delectable Portuguese spices: Tender with a nice kick! My choice was served with a large green salad and fries enhanced with garlic. I also sampled the grilled Octopus, which was fresh and tender.  I already want to go back!   The added bonus is that the most of the menu is Gluten Free - the owner and servers were great! However, this place gets 5 stars based on the food. :)"}
{"text":"What a little piece of heaven! Went with a colleague for lunch, and thoroughly enjoyed it. We started with a couple of cod cakes - the cod and potato mixture was smooth, and they were beautifully fried. I then had a chorizo sandwich, which was nicely spiced (the server asked how spicy I wanted it, and it was delivered at just the right mild heat). At first the sandwich appears to have a disproportionate amount of meat to bun, but you soon realize that the sausage is so flavourful that more would be just too much. The accompanying fries were delicious - seasoned with salt, pepper and garlic. Side salad was fresh and the vinaigrette helped cut the heavier dish. My colleague had the chicken breast and said it was delicious. We finished off the meal with coffee (served with steamed milk on the side, a nice touch), and a nata. The nata is a custard filled tart,  sprinkled with cinnamon - so good that I picked up 6 to bring home. Resto was clean, food fresh and service was great - I will be back!"}
{"text":"The chicken was pretty good. I like it spicy ! Extra hot sauce! The decor is alright."}
{"text":"Pretty good Portuguese resto. Once again found it threw Yelp and its yelpers. The olives and red sauce were great. I wanted to avoid the bread but that sauce was heaven.  Octopus starter was really good but the squid was OK. I can still taste the one I had in Porto....My chicken meal was good too. I really wanted the Cod but they just got the shipment and not ready. I guess next time."}
