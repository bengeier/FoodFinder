{"text":"Good fish and chips restaurant, the mood is nice and old. Friendly service and decent food. The price is a little high but overall acceptable. I won't mind coming here again if in in the area and feel like having fish & chips."}
{"text":"Terrible. I had the haddock and chips. The fish was so greasy it tore through the paper it was wrapped in, and the bag, after a 10 min. drive. Fries were undercooked, and soggy. There was one couple in the place at noon, so there was no excuse not to cook it to perfection. Maybe the owner/cook should shut off his cell phone, and focus on cooking properly."}
{"text":"No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  Please note the amount of reviews I have written on Yelp, not negative about much :).  I will have to say, you guys made me use Google Earth Map to confirm we are talking about the same spot you guys are reviewing so favourably lol  Horrible.    What I asked for was fish n chips.  I got the thinnest piece of fish ever known to mankind (think the thickness of a classic I pod), surrounded by batter.  More batter than fish.  Nice.   Really this is what you are raving about?  Not for from there are Baromal, Jasper, Malt and Salt to try.  They have less exactly square looking pieces of fish which I am always concerned about.  Did you half a real piece of fish?  As opposed to fresh fish the way I want it: nice thick piece, dipped in light and tasty batter and fried just the right crispiness.   I will not write bad reviews, cause what if I go back?  Not to happen here.  I think this place might be nostalgic to some people, and I respect that.  As for my thoughts on this place?    The fish reminded me of the shape and inside of a hashbrown.  Eat it if you are into that sort of thing."}
{"text":"It's THE fish and chips spot for Durham. Fish portions are large, and the batter not too greasy. It's my weekend staple and should be yours too!  The Halibut dinner is my fav."}
{"text":"Good place for your typical fish and chips! Have been going here for many years. Fish isn't too greasy and staff is very friendly. A very convenient location and good for take out. Also, you can order online through JustEat.ca"}
{"text":"Had a craving for fish and chips so I looked for one in Ajax.  Fish and chips were okay. Halibut I got was very thin. Scallops were imitation scallops.  Overall, I felt the food was mediocre."}
{"text":"I SHOULD HAVE LOGGED ON TO YELP BEFORE I WENT HERE BUT I WAS IN A RUSH! BECAUSE IT SEEMS IM NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO EXPERIENCED THE GREASE.  Let me start off by saying I was not expecting to have a healthy lunch. I knew what I was getting into. HOWEVER, I just spent 10 minutes trying to soak the grease out of my fish and chips after it made a MESS in my car from just being in the bag the grease was leaking out of the bag. I have had greasy food before but this is not EATABLE.   The french fries were HARD AS A ROCK over fried and they must have taken them out of the fryer and put them back in a few times.  not to mention I saw the gentlemen who was taking care of my fish drain the water out of my fish using his BARE HANDS??????? I did not even see him washing him before that.  I have never wanted my money back in my life for food. but its lunch time and I could not eat my food."}
{"text":"All the times I've been here in the summer I have enjoyed. I did not really enjoy this time I've been here (fries were oily and undercooked). Most of the time it's great."}
