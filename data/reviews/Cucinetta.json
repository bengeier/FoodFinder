{"text":"I come here a lot as I'm kind of obsessed with pasta and Italian food in general. It's an inviting dinning area and Service is typically fast. I really like the food it's just super expensive for the portion served. I usually get one of the combo specials but they don't have an option for the combos to come with water, just pop. For someone that doesn't drink pop and to be charged an extra $2 to get a bottle of water with a combo instead of pop is so stupid. I also get extra sauce as I feel like they don't put enough of it. So in total my meal -- a pasta,  side salad, and a bottle of water -- comes up to $15 which is way more expensive than anything else in York Lanes. 

I personally recommend the pasta rosa combo -- it's delicious

I'll come here for a treat but it's definitely not within my student budget."}

Yet another new addition to York Lanes after their renovations of 2012/13. This is an Italian restaurant with a modern vibe that, unlike most of the other take-out places at York, actually looks like a very inviting place to sit down and eat. They have a variety of options on their menu including pizzas, sandwiches, and pastas. 

The first thing I noticed was that the menu items were quite pricy. I've been there twice, and have paid $8 for a pretty mediocre sandwich and $7 for one slice of pizza. The slice of pizza was very good, and I'd likely come back for more, but the sandwich left much to be desired, especially at the price. 

Pros: Inviting atmosphere, pizza is amazing, only Italian place on campus
Cons: Quite pricy

If you are at the university however, I do urge you to give it a shot."}
{"text":"My first time here although I've always passed by it. I don't really understand the other reviews calling this place expensive, look at the inviting atmosphere, warm service, menu selection and quality of food.. I'd rather have something of good quality and tastes good than a large helping of subpar food. I also actually found their prices to be very decent, I left as a happy customer. I've never tried cannoli so I chose that, I got two for only $3+tax, the girl who served me made it fairly quickly so there wasn't much wait time. Other places usually sell one cannoli for that price. I noticed the price of a salad is $4, which sounds very fair to me. I'll likely be back next time to try other things on their menu."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a new addition to york university. It's very chic and has a lot of seating. I like to come here for a bite and to study. I've only tried the smoked salmon salad and vegetal pizza. My salad tasted good but I thought it was a bit overpriced for the size. Id buy it again because I loved smoked salmon and not a lot of places sell it on campus. I like the pizza dough and crust but I didn't like the flavour and there was not enough tomato sauce. I just felt like something was lacking. I believe this place has potential so i will come back to try other things on the menu. Plus the customer service is good."}
{"text":"One of the few places at York where you can get pasta. The pasta is alright, cooked just a bit over al dente and smothered in sauce. They also offer pizza, salads and paninis at a fairly steep price, but I mean, what do you expect? It's York."}
{"text":"Nutella banana pancake plus a latte for 5.75 as a combo. I can only say the pita was a little bit dry for me and the latte was too dark. But they have nice environment, free wifi and tap beer. Still a good spot for York students to hang out here or grab a quick meal like me"}
{"text":"I came here after a long study session and super hungry. I decided to splurge a little and buy some pasta from here since it's quite expensive compared to the rest of the food on campus (almost double). Seeing as how the price is quite high, I expected the quality of the food to be held to a greater standard. I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO WRONG IN MY LIFE.

I ordered the pesto alfredo fettuccine with chicken. It came out to about 17 dollars. RIP my wallet. 

The pasta is served in a depressing black takeout container that is placed on a tray. This, I can somewhat overlook as I don't expect dinnerware on campus, but for 17 bucks I'd expect more pasta (or you know, a maybe a plate?) which is dirt cheap to make or buy. 

The pasta is ever so slightly overcooked that it feel somewhat al dente but kinda mushy at the same time that it makes your blood boil because you can't figure out what it's supposed to be. The pesto alfredo sauce is bland! It's tasteless and doesn't even have much fragrance to it. Normally pesto, fresh or store bought is very fragrant yet I could not smell or taste any pesto in the sauce. The alfredo sauce was greasy, lumpy, very thick and not at all incorporated. It almost seemed like the person who made it melted just Parmesan cheese and forgot to add the cream altogether. 

The chicken was the only good part of the meal that was good. It was tender, had good flavour, colour on it, and some char on it. Not really worth the 3.50 to add it on though since the rest of the dish qualifies to be featured on Kitchen Nightmares.

I've had a 17 dollar plate of pasta on multiple occasions and this is definitely not a 17 dollar plate, scratch that, plastic food container of pasta. If anything, a Michellina's frozen dinner entree for 2 bucks coming from the microwave tastes better!

For what I got, I would rate this lower if I could. The only good thing about this place is that it has one the nicest decor out of all the places on campus and the cute cashier served me with a smile. If I ever wanted to spend around 17 bucks on food for myself again, I'd be better off buying an XL pizza from Pizza Pizza or a 10 piece box from Popeye's."}
