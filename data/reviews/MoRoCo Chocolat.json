{"text":"I didn't sit down, but got macarons. They were lovely but quite expensive, would buy again! The shop was also decorated really nice"}
{"text":"This review is only applicbable to their afternoon/high tea:  Tea selection was decent, the chocolate teas were not sweet, and they gave a generous amount of tea leaves. Macarons were dry (unexpected), scones were not bad but tiny and only two for each person... Some of the finger sandwiches were pretty good HOWEVER... All does not justufy the $55+tax+18.5%tip/person price!!! If it were not in Yorkville i doubt they could charge anything over $25."}
{"text":"I -love- this place. I went there for my birthday party, and it was everything I dreamed of and more. The decor was beautiful, the pots of tea huge and served in antique teapots. My one complaint was the size of the scones!  I paid $18 for a cream tea, and it came with a pot of tea and three super tiny scones, hardly bigger than a toonie! They were delicious, but gone regretfully fast. For that price, you should be able to get full sized scones. I had a  macroon, chocolate orange, and it was delicious!!"}
{"text":"This place is so original!  Beautiful chocolate boutique in the entrance way.  Luxurious seating area in the back.  Had dessert there one evening.  It was decadent.  Indoor s'mores.... so much fun!  Loved it.  Great ambience, great experience!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed that their macarons have gone downhill.  Have been to dozens of macaron spots on the GTA and thought this was my fave, until I returned recently after not having been for 2 years... Only to discover stale macarons with bland fillings.  A macaron should NOT be crunchy!  That means it's overbaked and/or stale!  A macaron should also have the famous \"feet\" and not just be flat.  Quite upset to spend as much as I did only to leave and try the \"crunchy\" macarons.  After 5 years in business this place appears to have become lazy with something they want to be known for."}
{"text":"This place is gorgeous! Stunning stunning stunning! Very Alice in Wonderland.  If you're hungry and looking for real food this is not the place - they have a real food menu but it consists of tiiiiiny expensive portions.   This is the perfect place for the girlyest outfit in your closet - the incredible shoes only another fashionista would appreciate, frills, a great skirt...and afternoon tea. Or their chocolate fondue. Order lots of water and a pot of herbal because all their desserts are so rich that you will feel the cavities beginning.   Their macarons are incredible!   And use the washroom, it's pretty."}
{"text":"I've visited MoRoCo twice and while both times the dessert did not disappoint, I had mixed experiences in terms of customer service. Unfortunately on my second visit our waitress forgot to bring sugar with coffee and by the time we reminded her and she got around to bringing it, the coffee was cold. She then forgot to place my friend's order which resulted in them waiting quite a while. To top it all off we waited yet again for the bill and then were told we couldn't pay with debit (who doesn't accept debit!?!?). When I gave her cash and asked for change she asked me to clarify as she wasn't sure what I meant by change. Seriously?!?!  I would definitely expect better customer service from a restaurant that charges such steep prices. Having said that, I would still give MoRoCo another chance as the first time I visited the customer service was fine and their desserts are absolutely delicious. The chocolate is to die for - I highly recommend the fondue. Be prepared to pay though as the prices are steep, although this is to be expected in Yorkville."}
{"text":"MoRoCo Chocolat comes highly recommended by a friend, who has said nothing but good things about this place. So I decided that it was worth a trip, or two in my case. First time around, after a satisfying dinner at Ciao Wine Bar, my friend and I stopped here for some desserts. We could not make up our minds, as always, so a plate with practically everything on it was clearly the right choice. Indulgent, I know. But let us not forget the principle behind this blog. We ordered the Rich Enough to Twitch, which had five different components:  - Red Velveteen: Red velvet crêpes with cream cheese, fresh strawberries, red velvet cake crumb filling, drizzled with chocolate sauce - Legally Blonde: Dulcey blonde chocolate tarte served with coconut almond struesel - S'more Love: Molton chocolate cake topped with marshmallow - Tiramisu: Sweet Italian sabayon with espresso - Apple Caramel Cheesecake: Caramel cheesecake finished with caramelized apples  The great thing about getting a plate with lots of different things is that, of course, you get to try a variety of items, and you are less likely to walk away completely and totally disappointed. The worst thing on that plate was the S'more Love, let's just say that I'm not a fan of burnt chocolate and foamy marshmallow? The best thing on that plate was the Red Velveteen, it was so good, really the perfect marriage between different flavours, drizzled with rich decadent chocolate sauce. Everything else falls somewhere in between.  Of course I had to come back for a second trip to try their macarons, that only makes the most sense in the world. My favourite was the Espresso, sweetness meets bitterness is like boy meets girl, the story just writes itself. The other Macarons were delightful as well.  Come to my blog and read more? :)  http://simplygluttonous.blogspot.ca/2013/07/moroco-chocolat.html"}
{"text":"Afternoon tea has been a little hobby of me and my friend for awhile. I chose this place as it was on a list of Afternoon Tea spots we wanted to check out in Toronto. Our first impression was how beautiful the restaurant was and we were so excited to experience tea here having gone to the Windsor Arms, Fairmont, the Ritz and Annona at the Hyatt.   I was looking forward to enjoying another great place for Afternoon Tea. To our dismay the excitement ended with the shinny tea pots and flower printed cups.  I now understand why all the photos taken were from a year ago. If you go there now you will be wondering where the rest of your afternoon tea meal went. Small soggy sandwiches have replaced the savory finger sandwiches showcased a year ago. There were no scones, clotted cream or jam. I have never complained about a price of a meal until now. Major disappointment will not be returning."}
{"text":"So disappointed on their macaron! French macaron is like the next big thing in Toronto, so I made up my mind to try whoever sell them in the city. Morocco has  built their name on chocolate&macaron, with pretty interior design,seems very promising to me. The macaron texture was so dry&crumbly,and there was an oily taste to it,as if they were in room temperature for a long time..it took me a while to get this unpleasant taste out of my palet....wish I will have more luck to my next macaron hunt."}
{"text":"MoRoCo is located on Yorkville street, but you wouldn't be able to see it just standing on the street. The entrance is kind of hidden, and I acutally missed it the first time. After walking into what feels like a hidden pathway, you come face to face with a purple-pink sign to let you know that you've made it. You've arrived to the chocolate lover's paradise that is MoRoCo.  The entrance to opens to the chocolate boutique, with a counter to order hand crafted chocolates, macarons, ice cream, and even take-out fondue (yes, you read that correctly!). The boutique is completely occupied with clean white furnishings, which in the presence of all the mirrors and bright lights, makes the space look a lot bigger than it really is. The subtle pink glow in the room makes everything look so pretty and elegant, I just want to buy everything in there!  If you're here for dinner, the hostess will take you into the dining room just beyond the boutique. The lighting and atmosphere changes almost drastically between the rooms, from clean and bright, to posh and dark. while still keeping the same feeling of upscale luxury. It's almost like a high end VIP boudoir --dimly lit interior, crystal chandeliers, plush sofas, giant framed mirrors, and thick draped velvet curtins.  Truffled Mac & Cheese ($18) I tried a spoonful of my friend's Truffled Mac & Cheese, and it was heavenly! The pasta was infused with an abundance of super creamy cheese, and crusted with a nice crunch on top. Without even trying my own entree yet, I already wished that I had ordered this instead. It's decadent without being overdone.  Lamb Shank ($15) - Seasoned New Zealand lamb braised in a tomato ragu My entree was the Lamb Shank which came as one chunk of meat on a bone. I was a little disappointed that it did not come with any pairings, because quite frankly it wasn't exactly a satisfying portion. The dish itself was average. Nothing too special. The lamb was cooked well, but I felt they could've done more to jazz up this dish aside from just a mountain of tomato sauce.  Maple Glazed Salmon ($14) - Oven banked atlantic salmon Two of my friends ordered the Maple Glazed Salmon, and the smells made my mouth water when it came. I didn't try any of it, but they both commended on how tasty it was. It comes with a small serving of deep fried thinly sliced potatoes.  Chocolate Fondue for 2-4 people ($26) They give you an option of 3 different types of Valrhona chocolate (66% dark, white, milk). The platter comes with a variety of dipping treats including strawberries, pineapple chunks, marshmallows, macaron cookies, and bananas. I first dipped a pineapple into the small cup of melted chocolate, and thought the consistency was a bit too runny. But as time passed, it definitely cools to the perfect consistency. It's not too sweet, which is always my biggest fear with chocolate fondue. Perfect fix for that chocolate craving. :)"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The atmosphere has an upscale feeling to it. Prices are reasonable and the food is delicious.  If you are dining with a party of 2-4 I recommend the chocolate fondue... You cannot go wrong. Pair it with one of their specialty teas and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The worst restaurant experience I've had in The last 2 years in toronto. 1 hour for quiche (so small, all brown crust) and my Friend ordered a salad that she sent back. ....when she sent her salad back I asked for a plate so we could split the micro-quiche....I finally got up and got a plate myself. Looks cute at the entrance but a real fooler. First and last time there!"}
{"text":"I read mixed reviews on MoRoCo including a number of harsh ones and was hesitant to try it out, but the location was convenient for dessert after dinner at a nearby restaurant. Also, I've had their macarons before and thought that they were decent.  The space was quite small, but very ornately decorated with mirrored furniture and the like. I loved the boutique displays of sweets.  I had s'mores, which were fun to make over the mini tabletop burner, but were much less satisfying to eat. The marshmellows are cute \"Hershey's kiss\" shapes, but quite hard and doesn't really melt the chocolate squares sufficiently. The menu was overpriced considering that everyone felt their orders were very mediocre. (Sipping chocolate was very thick, iced hot chocolate was just a chocolate slushy.)  The service was fine when we were eating, but when we left with 10 minutes to closing time, we were unable to purchase items from the boutique because the cashier had already cashed out. Since they were supposed to be open at the time, I thought they should have made the effort to complete the purchase. It was a shame because our guests were overseas visitors and were excited about the items they wanted to take home as souvenirs. It's not a great feeling when we invite our guests out and their last impression is one of disappointment."}
{"text":"I love the chocolate here and only really buy chocolate from here or Soma's on King St. Its an awesome tasty treat to share with friends and the deserts taste amazing and look amazing. Great birthday present to give is the chocolate Heel. My only problem is I asked to sit down for 5 minutes after buying $20 worth of chocolate and they lady said no. It was completely empty inside and the patio was 1/4 full."}
{"text":"Pros: - Fantastic decor for a girls day out - Great/fun presentation of food - Interesting/unique food options (marshmallows over an open fire)  Cons: -The fondue for two costs 28$ which is overpriced considering it was a very shallow pot of chocolate with a few dishes of chopped up fruit and marshmallows -  Service was slow - Seems to be a place where teenage girls would go (which is not necessarily a bad thing, just depends who you ask)"}
{"text":"I don't know, maybe I'm just not the target market.  The prices seemed way too high, but I guess you're paying for the dance club aesthetic: pounding music, neon lights, too-cool-to-be-here wait staff.  The takeout service is slow (we had to wait for someone to come out from behind the counter to box up our macarons), the vanilla macaron tasted like cake from a box (far too sweet and no recognizable vanilla flavour), and honestly, there were just too many small children running around shouting over the music to tell their parents what frozen yogurt toppings they wanted.  Ugh."}
{"text":"Decor ersatz but nice enough. Service outstanding - attentive and kind. And if you've read some of my other reviews, you know something's not quite right if I'm starting with decor and service - since I'l eat in any kurmudgony old hole in the wall so long as the food excels. So what was wrong? Well we went for mothers day high tea, so maybe it's not fair to judge, but aside from a lovely choice of teas (they actually brought samples for us to sniff at the table) the food left something to be desired. The finger sandwiches were really nothing special, truly uninspired. With the scones, they attempted creativity by making them smaller and offering them in three flavours. But at the end of the day the scone is the medium for the creams on top so the chocolate one in particular was too distracting. Plus they had these chunks of crystallized sugar on the top which was just gauche - reminded me of McDonalds apple turnovers from the '80s. As for the pastries - all too sweet. Maybe if you're serving 5 year-olds, substituting sugar for flavour is the way to go, but it's not so cool for a Yorkville establishment. The almond cake, mind you, was heavy on the flavouring, probably because the pastry chef dumped half a bottle of essence of almond into it. The shortbread was nice with a raspberry mousse, but again, too sweet to actually stomach. And the key lime marshmallow sounded gross and delivered on just that. Again, it might have appealed to 5 year-olds, but at $47.00 pp (tip was oddly included even for our party of two) there were no 5 year-olds to be found. Oh, as for the chocolate - there was one for each of us included with the sweets. Having lived in Switzerland on and off since I was a kid, I'm a bit of a purist. Moroco's chocolate was pretty good - 3.8 - but with just two samples, I'd have to come back. Given all the other great places you can now find chocolate in the city, I might not."}
{"text":"Yes it's pricy ($7.00 for a latte? A $14.00 brownie? Seriously?) but it's really the only place in the city which offers this kind of chocolate-overload experience.  I usually like to share a chocolate fondue with friends (my favourite is the milk chocolate, though the white-chai and dark chocolate are also worth a try). Just beware, they usually give you more chocolate than needed to dip all the fruit, marshmallows and pastries that come with it. You can buy extra dishes of things to dip, but if you don't like the idea of shelling out  an extra $2.00/dish for half a banana or 3 marshmallows (however delectable their homemade balls of white fluff really are), either (1) pace yourself accordingly or (2) chuck your shame out the window and dig into that chocolate fondue with your spoon."}
{"text":"I love that they serve their teas with a macaron that totally made my day. I had the passion fruit macaron. Delicious! One of the best macarons I've had.   I had the black tie cake. I honestly was expecting a lot more in terms of flavor. It was overpoweringly sweet and didn't have much chocolate flavor. The icing was white chocolate icing but tasted in pure icing sugar. Disappointed in the cake. Will be getting the chocolate torte cake next time, that looked delicious."}
{"text":"Service was excellent unfortunately the food was \"meh\". I went for high tea on Christmas Eve. The service was attentive and warm. The food was mediocre at best and at those prices I would have expected better.  The sandwiches we dried out and a little flavorless (except cucumber) the scones were also a bit stale.  The sweets were hit and miss.   I had been for brunch and dinner many years ago...but based on this experience am unlikely to go back for any meal.  The room is lovely though and seems unchanged since the place opened, it is clear the washrooms have seen some natural wear and tear and need to be freshened up."}
{"text":"This review is for the afternoon high tea only. I can only say that for over $70/ person i expected more, even for Yorkville. More refers to the quantity and quality. The finger sandwiches were hit and miss depending on the flavour and the macaroons were dried out (i hope what they sell in the store front is fresher). The scones and the sipping chocolate were good.   The atmosphere is very bourgeoisie and is definitely what you are paying for. So go for that, not for the high tea..."}
{"text":"I nearly fell off of my chair when I read someone write \"by far the biggest macarons ever!\". Really? You clearly have not been to many other macaron places. These were by far one of the smallest I have had!  So this place was not only hard to find (hidden in between the busy streets of Yorkville) and the prices were quite high for the small portions, but get this, my friend requested to use the washroom and they refused him. (LOL) The lady inside told him to walk around the building outside and it was going to be in some corner. I thought she was joking until she made a very serious face and pointed him the way. People have high-tea there all the time and you don't have a public washroom? What if they drink too much tea???   The macarons taste okay, not the best, but not the worst. I will admit that their patio outside is quite cute and inviting.   We just need some bigger macarons and public washrooms MoRoCo Chocolat, thank you."}
{"text":"The patio is very nicely decorated. Modern white with a hint of classic french vintage and eclectic with large chess pieces, gnomes, and fancy umbrellas.  We went there for drinks. I had the frozen hot chocolate (sooo delicious) and the passion fruit juice. Both amazing for non-alcoholics. My friends who can handle alcohol ordered the \"hot mess\".    As for the food, it is definitely quality over quantity. Everything was dainty portions akin that of what is served for high tea. The prices are premium as you would expect of any new trendy place.  Definitely a nice hang out. They have various, albeit pricey, high tea menus. You would expect nothing less for a place located in the heart of yorkville adjacent to places like One and the Four Seasons.  This is definitely a place for a date or a girls night out.  Though there are cute waitresses, this definitely aint anything like Real Sports or Jack Astors. Males arent exactly rushing to make a bee line for this place, unless they are into decor and high tea."}
{"text":"Me and my friend came for winterlicious, both our meals were 20 bucks and my friend got a latte. The bill came to 60 dollars!   They charge you 16% gratuity after they pile on the HST to your meal. If I knew they brazenly rob money from you like that I would never have come and no where on the winterlicious menu did it say that they charge you gratuity which is insane. This is just two people eating a lunch how can you have an automatic gratuity charge, so unwelcoming and audacious. I always give a 15% tip, but not on the HST. I found it offensive as  a customer. I've been going to winterlicious and summerlicious for years and this is the first time a restaurant has charged 16% on top of hst.  My friend's average tasting latte came in a minuscule, mini, tiny cup  and the cookie that it came with was way too sweet and inedible. This costs 7 bucks!!! Insane.  The salad was nice and fresh. The mac and cheese pretty good (not so good that I would pay so much again) and I liked the tiramisu - but the menu said it would come with a chocolate cup and they did not give that. Hate it when they promise to bring you something but don' t deliver. Service was really good, nice sweet girls and very attentive.   I wouldn't come back here. They misrepresent themselves and then you have to pay for it."}

Maybe I look like I have a small bladder! (DO I?) AND YES!!I was dressed to the nines!!!  Great place after shopping to chill out with girlfriends. I'm def going back for their Sinful desserts and creative yet simple dishes!"}
{"text":"Just came back from afternoon tea with the girls to celebrate a birthday. Today was my first and last experience with this restaurant.   We ordered high tea. Inquiring about the daily quiche - it has ham (apology 1), truffle mac & cheese - might also have ham, not sure (apology 2), no vegetarian options for high tea or regular tea (the kitchen doesn't do substitutes - apology 3). Girlfriend orders champagne - never arrives (apology 4). Tea pot leaks all over the table (apology 5 after the question whether or not I spilled it). No teaspoons on the table to eat the lemon dessert (oh I am so embarrassed, apology 6). Someone doesn't like chocolate scones, can we order 2 vanilla? Waiter - I'll place the order & see what happens. Chocolate scones arrive (apology 7 - apparently even scones are not exempt from the no substitution rule). Bills arrive and 2 people in the party have an additional $4 tea charge (apology 8 - sorry, you chose the special tea ... uhm, where was the information that some teas cost more especially when you don't have on hand what the original order was ... that was apology 9). When paying the bill, oh you want change? Sorry I only have dimes and nickels (apology 10).   Absolutely no motivation to make afternoon tea the experience it should be when you know no matter what level of service you provide there is an automatic $12+ tip included with each persons bill.   Pedestrian food (cold cuts on white bread, the cream cheese sandwich looked like the cheese had been scraped off the bread ... at least the salmon was somewhat decent).   Staff who could care less.   Tiniest serving of lemon curd and Devonshire cream (2 half filled shot glasses of each for 5 people and 10 scones).   Dirty silverware.   Silver tea pots that need a good polish.   More apologies than positive interaction with the guests.   Automatic 18.5% gratuity.    $75 later ...? No thanks.   If it wasn't for the company, I'm pretty positive the experience would have been 1 star.   With so many other options for tea in the city, my recommendation is avoid, avoid, avoid."}
{"text":"3.5  Good selection of teas. Dark chocolate fondue was good but nothing special. Strawberries not included in basic fondue price. Some of the accompaniments for dipping were of poor quality. Service was average at best. Very expensive for what you get. Poor value. Would not repeat."}
{"text":"I may be giving this place an unfair rating but read my review and you can judge for yourself.  First off; with drinks, appetizers, main course, and dessert, the bill came to about $100/per person.  Now, I don't mind paying $100 for an evening out but I really want to be wowed by the experience.  Instead, I just vowed never to go to MoRoCo again.  We came in a large group on a Friday and the place was pretty quiet.  I love good cocktails and when they're almost $20 a pop I want to truly love my cocktail but alas, it was not the case.  My boyfriend had their Manhattan not featured on the menu and they put sweet syrup in it.  Really?  Dear restaurants, please don't ever put sweet syrups in your Manhattan.   The service was slow, our orders kept getting messed up and we had to remind the server what it was that we ordered.  The meals in itself were tasty but did not warrant such a high price to them.  So this place is known for their dessert, right?  Well, okay, let's see if they can blow me away with their version of a S'mores.  Their dessert was so sweet that I couldn't taste any flavour except sugar and it was so sweet that a group of us couldn't finish it and it made my head hurt.  The upside?  Their bathrooms were really cool and nice."}
{"text":"Went today for high tea, and I have to say MEH to everything. We were seated, and we didn't see our server for 5 minutes. The food didn't come in a timely manner, and the savory sandwiches looked like I could have made it at home... not impressed.  AND, on top of everything, they charge a MANDATORY tip of 18.5% of tip! This is ridiculous, i wish I could deduct tips.  I expect so much more from a place in Yorkville that charges mandatory tips. Not worth going. I would instead recommend the Shangri-la high tea that's comparable price, has better ambience, and has much better service."}
{"text":"Came here for tea and dessert at Saturday afternoon with a friend. I got the S'mores Love and my friend got the apple galette (not sure what the name on the menu is) the desserts were very good. For tea, my friend got the Detox Green and I had the Breakfast in Paris. The tea was just regular English breakfast tea. I wish they had less fruity/ flowery options. The tea I had was the only plain one I could smell.  Service was great. We were not rushed even if we stayed there a couple hours chatting."}
{"text":"Amazing place for afternoon tea,  but VERY bad service (i've been there twice)"}
{"text":"With the festive holiday season now in full swing, my girl friends and I decided to, as part our yearly girly holiday get-together, hit up Moroco to taste some of their yummy chocolate deserts.  I myself was not uber excited about it as I am not a huge fan of chocolate (yes I said it!).  When we walked in, we were quite pleased.  The decor was very elegant and tasteful.  Upon spending a few minutes drooling over the menu, we decided to share the chocolate fondue trio and a desert platter which included \"spring rolls\" as well as other goodies.    The fondue was simply amazing and was served up with fruits and goodies such as french cookies and marshmellows.  The chocolate  itself was creamy and delicious and all very heavenly.  The spring rolls we ordered had pieces of banana, chocolate and caramel and lived up to our expectations and were served up with brownies which equally had great reviews around the table.  Despite the expensive prices (which explains my rating of 4 stars otherwise it'd be 5), the general consensus was that desert was definitely a hit and we would definitely hit up Morococ again.  To put it lightly, we all agreed that if our dates brought us here the pay off would be well worth the price.  So a tip for all you men out there -bring a date here and it would probably pay off by leaps and bounds (if you catch my drift)."}
{"text":"I was left nothing less than impressed when my friends and I had a fabulous girls night out and picked this as a venue. We all enjoyed our iced cold chocolate drinks, mains and ofcourse the desserts! I highly recommend the 'iced debauchery', truffled mac n cheese and red velvet crepes. I tried some of the Kiss Me Kake and Melt-teaser and they were absolutely divine as well. I love the interiors of the restaurant and the chocolate boutique..it is an ideal venue for a group of girls getting together or even a date. Our waiter Roger was very friendly and patient and my group was very impressed with the service! At the chocolate boutique, I highly recommend the sea salt and almond chocolate bar, it's the best chocolate I've tasted. They have a great selection of macaroons, truffles and gift items. Can't wait to go back, perhaps for brunch!"}
{"text":"Macaron Day TO  I have evaluated macarons from the following establishments: Petit Thuet, Bobbette and Belle, Daniel et Daniel, Butter Avenue, Nadege, Moroco Chocolat, Ruelo Patisserie, and La Bamboche. Each location was graded on their atmosphere, service, selection, packaging, and of course, macarons. Please check out my profile for reviews of the other locations.  Location: 99 Yorkville Ave (hard to see from the street, tucked waaaay in. Street and underground parking available).  Atmosphere: Very opulent and lavish, romantic and elegant, perfect for dates. You are paying for the atmosphere here. Generally quiet to average noise level, most people speak under the volume of the music.  Service: Lovely service by Tracy. Never rushed and despite arriving at the end of the night, she let us choose any macaron as our free macaron. I purchased three afterward.  Selection: A small to medium selection, but since Moroco is known more for its' chocolate, it was sufficient.  Macaron: All three macarons were satisfactory, slightly larger than your usual size. Some had lots of air in it, parts of it were crumbly. The Yuzu had some crunchy granuales in it which surprised me. I'm not sure if that was intentional. Vanilla was plain... too plain, even for vanilla. I enjoyed the Lavender but it was not better than Butter Avenue's Lavender.  Conclusion: I would return to give the dine-in/tea a try, but not sure I would go just for the macarons.  I give Moroco Chocolate a B.  My final thoughts: Out of all the macarons and locations I've tried (and ensuring to cleanse my palette with water after each bite), the top two contenders have to be Ruelo and Butter Avenue. Both establishments made macaroons their specialty and both execute them incredibly well. You honestly cannot go wrong with either of them. Nadege is a good alternative and if you're looking for a dine-in experience to try other nibblets. La Bamboche is nice on the go. Moroco Chocolate and Bobbette and Belle are also both worthy choices. I would avoid Daniel et Daniel or Petit Thuet though I heard good things about their other ventures and products (macarons are definitely not their forte)."}
{"text":"Make your own smores at the table?!  HELLO!  Genious!!!!   Crazy prices=2 cups of coffee, one cup of hot chocolate, one frozen hot chocolate, and one order of smores = $71.00 including tip (that they included at 18%).  When you consider the drinks alone shouldn't cost more than $10.00 at the 'bucks, those smores cost $50.00.  But hey, for an experience I've never had anywhere else, I'll pay it!    Waiter was a bit snobby, but that's alright, because the hostess, and the other waitresses were fabulous so I'm sure it was his own problem.   Go for a fabulous dessert experience in a fabulous atmosphere--just remember to bring the plastic."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Friendly staff. Classy, modern and sexy atmosphere. Can't ask for more."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place has such high ratings!!   We went here for high tea on a Sunday afternoon and I was appalled at the terrible service and quality of what this entailed. It ended up costing about $75/person for sipping chocolate, 3 mini sandwiches, 3 scones and about 3-4 truffles (that tasted terrible btw). This included an 18.5% gratuity which they are legally not entitled to enforce. The service was terrible and the waitress had no idea what high tea was and kept having to \"check\" about our options.   When we asked for the manager and asked about the automatic 18.5% gratuity he gave us attitude and said something along the lines of \"if that's how you feel, I guess I understand since it is Christmas and all\" implying that we were broke or could not pay the full tip. After he went to the back to remove the tip, he came back and decided that since it was written on the menu, we had essentially agreed to the 18.5% regardless of the quality of service and turned away and hid from us the rest of the time we were there.  Overall, hated the food, hated the service, and especially hated the attitude of the manager. I would never recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I don't remember the last time I visited a place and wanted to get to the computer so badly to write a review. Well you guys just earned this one:   The decor of the place is great, once we got in.. we were enjoying the atmosphere - however unfortunately it all went downhill as soon as we got what we ordered.  The tiramisu was so dry that I felt they missed the step of soaking the biscuits in coffee - when the waitress came to ask about all the things we ordered we told her that the tiramisu was very bad (hoping she will switch it or offer something instead.. what most normal places do.. especially if you are charging above normal) all she said is \"thank you for letting me know\"  the 18.5% tip charge is ridiculous - they don't deserve 1%.  After reading the reviews.. I guess I am not the only one and I am not sure how they are still in business with such horrible customer service and food."}
{"text":"We stopped here for a little tea break, we were thirsty and just wanted to sit somewhere in Yorkville to chill. We were out in the patio to enjoy the summer weather. We didn't eat, just order a pot of tea with macaron. I got the \"very peach\" tea - black tea with bits of pear and peach extracts. The pistachio macaron was good, freshly made, chewy texture and creamy pistachio cream in the middle. We didn't try any of their chocolate stuff so no comment on that. It was definitely overpriced, $10 for a pot of tea. Price to pay eating at Yorkville."}
{"text":"I've been to MoRoCo as both a dine-in customer and a boutique shopper.  I went for brunch on a Saturday with a few girlfriends.  The decor was elaborate (in a trashy Marie Antoinette way) but fun.  The servers were all very pleasant.  The food was nice, but expensive for what you get.  We had Salmon Eggs Benedict, Caramel Banana Pancakes, and Milk Chocolate Fondue.    The salmon benny was good, but I've had the same elsewhere for a better price.  The pancakes were delicious though, and the fondue was also very good.  You can select milk, white or dark chocolate for the fondue.  They bring it to you in a little crock pot over a flame, and the morsels include homemade marshmallows, bananas, pineapple, strawberries, and mini financiers.    I've also been in just to purchase chocolates and macarons.  The macarons have always been fresh when I got them.  I love the Salted Caramel and Pistachio ones!  I've also tried Lavender, Rose, Raspberry, and Lemon - all quite good.  It's a nice spot to go to for a macaron fix!"}
{"text":"Typical afternoon tea. Just looks nice, nothing special about the taste. Service was very slow."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this cute gem recently and I was pleasantly surprised!   Very nice decor and our server was excellent.   We shared the chocolate sipper - milk chocolate and chai and the red veleteen. Both were delicious. I'm not a chocolate person, so sipping chocolate was a bit much, but it was a good experience.   I would definitely recommend this place to go to with girlfriends - next time I would like to try their high tea!   Cheers!   - T"}
{"text":"My friend and I visited MoRoCo this evening to take part in the \"Summerlicious\" promotion. We were pleased overall but there were a couple of things that could have been improved. The service was great, we were seated immediately and our waitress was very attentive to our needs.   Appetizer:  I ordered the Caesar Salad and was very disappointed. The description of the salad was very deceiving as I received a plate full of lettuce topped with plain store bought croutions and simulated bacon bits. It was a bit disgusting and would have appreciated real bacon. The dressing was sub-par. My friend ordered the Mandarin Orange Salad which she felt also included too much lettuce and not enough toppings. There was only one orange slice in total.   Main: We both got the hamburger which I though was delicious and was cooked perfectly. The Dijon mayo was superb.  Dessert: We ordered the Red Velveteen Crepe. It was out of this world. The flavours were rich and the strawberries were fresh.    Overall we enjoyed the atmosphere and decore of the restaurant. The washrooms were clean and the staff was friendly. I would definitely recommend MoRoCo to anyone looking for a nice after dinner dessert cafe or maybe for lunch."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place to have a hot chocolate on a cold winter's day...alone or with a \"more than\" friend.  MoRoCo Chocolat is also my new favorite afternoon tea spot - I find great enjoyment in sitting back in the lush ambiance of the pure gluttony filled luxury of chocolate aroma (how's that for a mouth full - did it even make sense?)  All kidding aside - this place is a winner and one of the few reasons to visit Yorkville for on a Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"This is favourite place in Toronto for beautiful & delicious desserts - even if they are pricey.   Their lunch and brunch menu items are not bad - Yorkville pricing but decent quality food. Their chocolate truffles are good, but not stellar. Their 3 drinking chocolates are interesting, but not on the same level as Juliette et Chocolat in Montreal.   I wouldn't recommend their high tea - it is ridiculously expensive, their scones are tiny, rock-hard and dry; their finger sandwiches standard and their macarons are chalky and disgusting. They are far too sweet, the cookie part is dry and they are a far cry from the fabulous macarons of Ladurée.   Their tea menu is from the Tea Emporium so nothing is particularly unusual or exciting. For the $10/pot that MoRoCo charges you could buy yourself some loose leaf tea and enjoy for  6 months! Also, an 18% gratuity is automatically added if you come here for high tea. If you want a high tea experience, go to the Windsor Arms. The scones and sandwiches are far superior.  I love the decor and the service is always excellent. I would only suggest coming here for an afternoon dessert."}
{"text":"Today I decided that I wanted to try a new place that sells macarons, so I decided to go to MoRoCo.  Find it is kinda challenging in the maze that's called Yorkville, it's set off the street a bit inside what looked to be like an office building.  I stepped inside the boutique area, and I was surprised at how small it was, seeing that the restaurant takes up most of the space.  I decided to go with the pumpkin (must be a seasonal flavor) and the chocolate.  The pumpkin tasted really good, but it was very sweet.  The chocolate was PERFECT.  It wasn't excessively sweet like you would think a chocolate macaron would be, but it was perfect.  I could also taste a little bit of some sort of liqueur in it, which was good.  I think I'l be back when I feel like splurging again, for a $2.75 a piece macaron."}
{"text":"Everything in Yorkville requires one to be indulgent and MoRoCo is no exception. But that's the idea right?!  Be prepared to indulge in your caloric intake - the food is delicious and incredibly rich!  The fondu is great, the selection of dippers is sensational.  Be prepared to indulge in your time away from the office - don't expect a quick sit down lunch.The service is incredibly pleasant, it's just also incredibly... relaxed.  Perfect for an extended sunny afternoon patio lunch.  Be prepared to indulge in your pocket book - while it's likely inexpensive for Yorkville, for the average Joe the bill can climb quickly if taking in beverages and food before the $24 chocolate fondu. Well worth it though.  Overall, a lovely experience. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I went here on a Friday night, swanky and great ambiance with lounge music.  We had the Pistachio Cardamom Pana Cotta and Tiramisu.  Very nice presentation and decadent.  I wouldn't usually come here unless it was a special occasion but if you're a guy I'm sure you will impress your date if you take her here.  Note: they add gratuity on top of your bill"}
{"text":"Restaurant: MoRoCo Chocolat Cuisine: Desserts Location: Yorkville Address: 99 Torkville Ave Price Range: $15-25  1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent  Food: 3 Service: 4 Ambiance: 4 Overall: 3.5  Extra information:  *They serve Brunch, Lunch and Dinner *Catering and hosts events *Full Bar  You see the Restaurant and their beautiful Patio outside once you walk up the stairs. MoRoCo is surrounded by lots of little shops around. They sell food and dessert but they are more so known for their desserts.  Macarons are $2.75 each and $16.50 for box of 6. Truffles are $3.00 each and $19.50 for box of 6. They also sell Frozen Yogurt, Cappuccino, Latte, Espresso, Frozen yogurt and etc to go.   Macaron Heaven! Mango Tango, Lavender Cassis, Salted Caramel and my Fav, Pistachio, Coconut, Caramel Apple, Coffee, Chocolate Cherry. Vanilla, Chocolate, Raspberry and Passionfruit.  I didn't get to try the macaroons  this time cause I was so full by the time I left...but NEXT TIME!! for sure I will pick up a few :)  Restaurant has beautiful purple velvet interior. There are sofas and tables everywhere and the booth I sat in, was very comfortable.  I ordered the fondue for 4-6 people. Few random facts about this place and their service. They have really good service, all the waitress wears either black or purple so it's easy to identify them. To be honest I didn't even really feel the need to look for them cause they were always around and they somehow knew when we needed them, and what we needed them for. Also it smelled really good in the restaurant, that's always a plus :)  Random Fact: All their plates and cups were Villeroy & Boch. For those who are not familiar with the brand- it's a luxury brand from Germany that's sold in Saks Fifth and Ashley (located Bloor and Yonge).  Fondue for 4-6, this is $40 dollars. You can choose betwen Milk chocolate, Dark chocolate and White Chocolate- I chose Dark chocolate. This came with Strawberry, Pineapple, Banana Bread, Homemade Strawberry Marshmellow, Macaroon cookies, Green apples and Bananas. Chocolate was so creamy and smooth, with just a touch of bitterness that you look for in a Dark chocolate. I enjoyed strawberries and banana bread the most.  Our bill came to $56.50 after tax. It's a lot more than how much I would spend on a dessert, but personally, the experience was worth it.  Summary: This place is pricy for sure, even just for food. But if you are having a girls night out or just want to splurge on some sweet stuff. MoRoCo Chocolat is the place for you.  *chomp chomp*"}
{"text":"The best desserts in all of Toronto... We were introduced to this place by friends who live in Toronto... Will definitely come back.. Thanks"}
{"text":"It's my 3rd time here. But kinda disappointed today. The dessert was just ok, not great. Tea was tasteless. Only hamburger was fine.  I was satisfied last two times. But very disappointed today. May not go back recently."}
{"text":"Having been to MC twice before, I came in again for a little afternoon treat. The food was just OK, almost mediocre. The service was very sloppy, inattentive, and classless, without being rude, funny enough. Btw, we were the only ones in the restaurant. For those prices vis-à-vis quality and service: Never going back."}
{"text":"As an avid afternoon tea connoisseur, I was fairly disappointed by Moroco chocolat. I'll give them a high score for their ambience but when it comes down to the nitty gritty, their food was a let down. Soggy sandwiches which were made out of white bread! It was that sandwich where you hate when the bread sticks to the roof of your mouth ... Ya that! And NO SCONES! Every high tea goer knows there must be scones!!  Service wasn't all that great either ... I had to keep asking for the sugar. Then the milk, and let's not forget the automatic 18% gratuity they put on the bill. I guess this is one of those times when you should listen to the saying \"Don't judge a book by its cover!\""}
{"text":"For some reason, the macarons have been tasting stale the few recent times I've visited. Service has also been snootier than usual.   I came here for high tea with my mom, and they automatically charge 18% tips to the bill. I was a bit annoyed at this as I'm a strong believer that tipping is at the discretion of the customer's experience. Now that my experience has gone downhill, I certainly don't feel it's fair to be forced into this.   The sandwiches were very bland and dry. The scones, however, were nice, fluffy and warm. The maracon that came with the high tea package was stuck on the plate.. leaving me wondering if this was something out on a display case and left out too long.   Sad to make this disappointing update, but I don't think I will return to Moroco again.   They also need to turn down the music - makes the whole place seem tacky with their princessy furniture with Miley Cyrus playing in the background.."}
{"text":"It was love at first taste! Fulfilling all my chocolate fantasies!   Yes, it's damn expensive for chocolate, but it's Yorkville. ...And a bad chocolate habit is still cheaper than a bad cocaine habit.  Decadent, luxurious, and silky smooth hot chocolate. We ordered the sipping chocolate pot for two ($19). It didn't look like a large serving, but considering it's liquid calories, you don't need a whole lot.    Accompanied with spoonfuls of fresh whipped cream and sipped with water, it was heaven.  We had the dark chocolate (66% cocoa) and if I could discreetly lick the pot, I would have.  The marcarons are worth the hype.  Perfect French-style sandwich macarons for $3.50 each.  I had the salted caramel and coconut macarons. They were large, crunchy, and chewy with a generous amount of filling.  I took the smallest bites I could to maximize my macaron experience.  I loved them!  They had heart shaped ones for Valentine's Day, so adorable!  The venue itself is beautiful.  The lounge space had ample seating.  Fashion patterned walls and dark plush seating, this place is super trendy but comfortable.    Compared to other chocolate cafes, Moroco doesn't have a huge selection of hot chocolate.  There were a lot of chocolate cocktails available, but I felt that they should expand on their non-alcoholic chocolate offerings as well.  Also, I've been to cafes where even the entrees had a chocolate twist, but here they do not.  The service was slow, but I didn't notice so much in my self-induced chocolate comatose state.  Actually, the fire alarm went off and we still didn't get up.  Anyways, I love chocolate and this place is one of my favorite sweet spots in the city!"}
{"text":"I've tasted all kinds of their macarons, except chocolate flavour and the sugar one , rating from best? Vanilla, well balance of sweetness level, great taste of real vanilla Salted Caramel, YUMMY!STICKY BUT JUICY! One side of cherry(forgot the actual name:P), good taste as well, better than cherry Pistachio with chocolate, the chocolate is a little too strong and too sweet causing pistachio to be suppressed. However, I still love the pistachio part. Their macarons share some commons, which are made with real ingredients and have good texture when it is in your mouth. Everything else is not good enough. I never want to taste again. For example, the strawberry one is spicy and the cherry one is too sweet."}
{"text":"Best Macaroons in town by far! I like this an alternative to going out to bars because you can get the same thing here. Yes it is pricey but it has a great atmosphere especially on the patio outside. I make a point to stop by anytime I'm around to pick up their chocolate. It's also gained quite the celeb following with the housewives of Vancouver and everyone stopping by. To keep prices lower I'd recommend just picking stuff out of their retail store!   My boyfriends a big fan of the boyfriend treats despite the back lash they received!"}
{"text":"This is a place I plan on going back to.  The decor is stylish and swoon worthy.  Everything here is so darn cute.  When in Yorkville I like to stop by here for a macaron.  The salted caramel ones are to die for, you need to try one!  They also serve chocolates, truffles, and sipping hot chocolate at their counter.  I was here for afternoon tea and the food was fabulous.  The teas are from the Tea Emporium and one of the favourites was the Cream of Avalon.  I had the Garden of Eden green tea which was amazing as well.  You get 3 different sandwiches (cut into thin rectangle) and a selection of scones and desserts.  When I saw the spread, I thought for sure this wasn't going to be filling.  The sandwiches make you hungrier for more, but when you hit the scones (which are dense and heavy) you barely have room for dessert.  We took the leftover desserts to go and they came in a really cute take out box.  Afternoon tea was $45.  Definitely worth it for an experience like this."}
{"text":"Ah! MoRoCo chocolates! This is the place where I Tried my first macaroon and the obsession has grown ever since. They make amazing macaroons , the Decor is beautiful & the chocolate is Devine. I've eaten at the restaurant twice once at the patio and once inside ..and both times I had an amazing experience! The customer service is great. This one girl named Sabrina is always so helpful and she always has a smile on her face. (She's very beautiful also.) the reason I'm giving this 4 starts instead of 5 is because the price for everything is soo steep! However this is understandable. Considering the location & quality :) this is probably my Favriote place to visit when I'm in yorkville:) amazing keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"The RUDEST waitress I've ever had in my life. I came for winterlicious lunch with some girlfriends. The waitress was an older blonde lady who seemed like she hated life. She gave us a lot of attitude and she kept badgering us to order drinks and we kept telling her we were waiting for another friend who was late. She gave me cut eye for ordering water, her tone was condescending and she was full of attitude when explaining the menu. She gave us even more cut eye when we asked about the tea selection and when I asked about the bill. When we were paying the bill, she started being fake nice to us, fake smiling - which is unfortunately the only smiling we got from her.  She charged us 18.5% tip.. If it was up to me I would have tipped 0% for her poor customer service. The extra gratituities were not clearly mentioned. And it was only supposed to be 16%.   Other than that I enjoyed the ambiance of the restaurant and the food was good, but didn't make up for how the waitress treated us thats why I'm only giving one star."}
{"text":"Great place to go to with your girlfriends. I always feel very Marie Antoinette whenever i  go. Fondue and the pots of tea are great for sharing. There's also lots of savoury items on the menu and a small shop on the way out to get chocolate gifts. wish there were more similar places in Toronto!"}
{"text":"This review is for their boutique shop.  Been visiting Moroco once or twice a year for the past few years when I began my search for the best macaron in the GTA - I have long since crowned Ruelo with that title. For this year's Macaron day, I went right after work to see what they're offering and if anything has changed or new flavours came out.   I got: - free mini version of their salted caramel good flavour, but too 'fluffy' to be a macaron  - 6pcs of macs they had better texture than the sample, but I was disappointed that they don't offer the clear boxes for the macarons like they used to (boxes are only available for the 12 pcs). For the price you pay, I expect a box to protect the macarons instead of a paper bag. - 12 pcs chocolates (yes, this comes in a box) This one's for my sister so I can only say that they use valrhona chocolates, they have a good variety of flavours and very pretty  The boutique itself is what you'd expect for Yorkville...small, cute, pristine, all white walls, chocolates, macarons and other sweet treats displayed in glass shelves... And very expensive. Service is usually good. Today tho, they decided to put a new girl out infront while there was a rush of people lining up to get their free macaron. It's a nice place to visit once in a while when your in the area and feel like splurging."}
{"text":"went to buy some gift chocolate for an out of town chocoholic, and heard good things about MoRoCo.  And nope. Not going back. I missed seeing the no-stroller policy on the door ( it was quite dark outside the shop) and had I seen it I'd have turned around and left. My first clue should have been that its evidently non-accessible, we simply lifted our small lightweight stroller up the stairs. I will even grant the place is small, and maybe strollers don't fit, but uh...can't leave my infant in the cold un attended ( he waited outside with dad anyway), would have been a hassle if I was solo parent that day. So that just left a bad taste in my mouth.   Service: sucked. I was third in line and for some reason the clerk looked like she had no idea what the till was for, and it was a long wait to be served because only reluctantly did she fetch help for her issue. I almost left without paying but we had made a trip up to it specifically for a gift.  So in short, nope. Won't be back, in light of the other reviews where they echo the same issues. Its not like they're the only chocolatier in town, they're not so special. I've been to patisseries in europe and asia and they don't treat you like an unwanted guest as it seems to be the routine here. Snooty service doesn't mean classy.   Tone down the unfriendliness ( and I am by no means a customer that wants to have my backside kissed, I just want a modicum of courtesy,) and we could get somewhere."}
{"text":"The most disappointing dessert lounge I have visited. One of the worst service I have experienced. We waited about 30 minutes before we got served, and every request after that took as much to get done. We waited about 30 minutes to get out bill, not acceptable! NO ONE came to ask for the bill or even pay attention to us. We even had to wait to pay. Automatic 15% gratuity added, and on top of that, they expect guests to leave tip as well. The place was very pleasant, good atmosphere, the dessert portion was small but delightful. However, overall, I would not suggest."}
{"text":"The best macaroons Toronto has to offer HANDS DOWN. So moist, big, flavorful, etc.  My first trip ever there, wonderful experience.  The store is so elegant, it looks like your walking into a jewelry box."}
{"text":"Tried the macaroons from here and overall it wasn't that good of an experience. The place was packed and the quality was sun par. You can tell their efforts go to presentation rather than food quality. Overpriced for the quality of food they have."}
{"text":"Nice places and foods. But the serves was not worth for 18.5% gratuity! If we haven't checked the bill we would absolutely paid the extra."}
{"text":"This is one of the most cutest/fanciest restaurants I've been to. Specifically with their plushy cushions, and royal-type surrounding. It is located behind a dessert store as well! Very neat.  My friends and I came for Summerlicious and ordered the ceviche, soup, chicken club sandwich, mac and cheese, zucchini spaghetti, crepe with chicken. Everything was very average - the taste was leaning on the bland side. The looks of some dishes are alright, but the others are very plain - not appealing. The dessert dishes were more impressive. With the summerlicious menu, we ordered the gelato macarons and eclair. The gelato macaron was my favourite. What I did come for was the Melteaser, on their regular menu. It was a ball of chocolate that you pour hot-temperature chocolate onto and it melts to reveal berries and ice cream inside. It was beautiful and fun. The taste of that dessert didn't really strike me as something really delicious either.   Service was a bit slow. There weren't a lot of people in the restaurant, but we had to go up to them closer to the end to get our bill. It's an interesting experience, but I'd probably come .back with the intentions of having a dessert date."}
{"text":"Service is awful and it is freezing inside even in the middle of summer, there are way better spots around Yorkville."}
{"text":"fancy pretty chocolate and really good macarons.  I've tried almost every flavor of their macarons n all r good. The texture is great,  has nice crunch to it,  just wish it was more chewy.  Had their set menu for Valentine's 2010 dinner n was not impressed. the food is not so yummy. presentation was pretty as always but taste, ...not so good. it was more of a sampling menu, so everything was tiny. regardless of the portion, nothing stood out in a good way nor was it memorable. they say theirs truffle n foie gras in some fritter or something but we couldn't taste or see it. it was pretty dark in the restaurant that night n we can't really tell wut we r eating. lol  the place has a great interior design/decor and comfortable seating.  the vibe is a bit too posh for me. the DJ was friendly n gave us a CD that he made for us to listen to in the car on our ride home, that was a nice touch to end a valentine's dinner.  probably won't dine here again. but will come for the chocolate shop side of it! the macarons n chocolate makes great gifts!! they packaged it so pretty!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped here on a date just recently and I fell in love with this place.  I didn't try a lot yet so I'll definitely be back for more ... This place has a great atmosphere for a date or just a laid back outing with a friend or two.  The music was old school and awesome... I believe they had a DJ playing that night.  We ordered a tasty Crème brûlée to share, an Irish cream for my date and Rooibos tea for myself ... It is pricey (so not for anyone that's trying to be budget conscious) but for a nice treat every once in a while it's definitely the place to go"}
{"text":"I've been here about three times and always order their mac and cheese. It is extremely delicious and has never disappointed. Their holy trinity fondue is great to end off with. I don't really care for the dark chocolate so I usually just ask for an extra white chocolate. I went for summerlicious and they had their red velvet crepe. It was so incredibly good but a tad bit sweet. This is a great place to go to in the winter or summer. The price is a bit hefty, but keep in mind it is Yorkville."}
{"text":"Great Victorian atmosphere and good for a group of girls to sit, relax and chat! It can be a tad pricey but I love their tea options; peachy tea is my favorite! Macarons are $3 each but if you get tea, you get one for free and $3 to add a cup but comes with a macaron so it's like a two-in-one deal :)"}
{"text":"I went there for high tea and had and had a surprisingly amazing experience at Moroco Chocolat..   My employers gave me the afternoon off for working so hard and I was so excited I called up one of my girlfriends to go out for afternoon tea  to celebrate. I called everywhere to make reservations, the Ritz, tea buds, Windsor, Annona, Shangri, you name it I called and they were all booked or not open for afternoon tea.   The reviews I saw for Moroco weren't so good so I was very hesitant to call them, but I did because there was nowhere else. Online it said you needed to make reservations 24 hours in advance. When I called they accommodated me and said I could just come in.  When I arrived I was very impressed with the décor. If you are a girly girl, you will like it. I'm 30, so I am not such a girl, but you get the idea. It was \"young and trendy\" unlike Windsor Arms which is quite \"old and stuffy\". The service was great and the waiter was very attentive.  When the food arrived, the presentation was awesome. The scones were so good!, the sandwiches looked kind of boring but were melt in your mouth good! Especially the ham one. The desserts were cute and presentation unique. Very tasty.  All in all, it was very good and I would recommend it over the Windsor arms which is the only place I have been to for afternoon tea/ high tea in Toronto. However, I have been to a few places in London, UK. So I know what I am talking about ;)"}
{"text":"MoRoCo is a BIG FAIL... but I'm giving it 2 stars cuz the decor and the store-front staff got it going on. It's too bad because MoRoCo has the potential to be oh-so-lovely, but it honestly is a big miss.  Here's the SHORT VERSION REVIEW.  (Trust me, a couple points need to be in ALL-CAPS.)  - We were seated 40 minutes after our reservation time plus we were never given any brunch menus even though we were told at the time of booking  we can order a-la-carte off the regular menus.  - I'M CONVINCED IF I DIDN'T ASK IF THERE WAS A SERVER ASSIGNED TO US, NO ONE WOULD HAVE COME TO OUR TABLE.   - Their High Tea is the lowest on my list.  - GETTING OUR BILL WAS A MISSION! OUR BILL WAS ALMOST $700! YOU WOULD THINK THEY WOULD WANT US TO PAY!  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *  Here's the LONG VERSION REVIEW if ya got some time to read the details of my MoRoCo experience...  Having recently started working in the restaurant industry, I completely understand why our reservation was sat 40 minutes late. It's Mother's Day weekend, the restaurant is full and no one has left, so yes it would therefore be impossible to seat us on time. However, my friend who made the reservation specifically asked what time our reservation should be in order to ensure we would not be waiting long. So this wait was unacceptable to my friend who proceeded to give the hostess a piece of her mind which I didn't agree with because it technically wasn't the hostess' fault.  What I don't understand is after we were seated, no staff acknowledged us or even glanced at our table (of 10 people) for at least a half hour. I had to fetch someone to ask if there was a server assigned to us and at the time we were seated, the restaurant wasn't even half full anymore so there was no reason for no one not to even greet our table.  When booking our reservation, we were told we can order a-la-carte off the regular brunch menu, but unfortunately we were only given High Tea menus. Since we now have been waiting for an hour and 10 minutes, we didn't bother asking for them because we were quite hungry and restless.   And when our High Tea arrives... it's disappointing :( I think the High Tea for 12 years & under is much better than the adults version. It's got cute striped straws in cutesy bottles of chocolate milk, chocolate covered strawberries, Nutella and jam sandwiches... The only thing that was good about my High Tea was the proportion size. I had to take some home which is usually a nice treat when you like what you're taking home. Unfortunately, the sandwich fillings were all pretty bland and unmemorable, the truffle mac n cheese was only okay and the scones were stiff. I've had high tea in other places where the scones are still warm and melt in your mouth. So that is the standard I look for.  20 minutes after finishing and receiving to-go-containers, in order to get the staff's attention, my friends allowed their daughters (3 of them, 6 years or under) to run around the neighboring tables and be fairly loud, but the staff continued to ignore us. ANOTHER FAIL.  At least the store-front service was much better!   Prior to entering MoRoCo's restaurant area, you are forced to walk through their boutique which sells a bunch of their ridiculously good-looking treats. So of course many of us bought a box of macarons... Sure they have a great selection of flavors and yes they are quite tasty, but I have had better macarons and wouldn't go out of my way to consume these. However, the girls that helped us in the front were extremely helpful and accommodating and very pleasant even though at times the customers including a friend of mine were being a bit of a pain-in-the-ass. This 1 particular girl always kept her composure with a pretty smile on her face while aiding the busy line up of mostly high-maintenance customers even though she deserved to whack a few of them in the head! An A+ goes specifically to her! But unfortunately SHE ALONE IS NOT WORTH THE ALMOST $1000 IN TOTAL WE SPENT this establishment! :("}
{"text":"I've always wanted to come here for a sit down, and I still haven't had the opportunity. However, I finally got to try out their colorful macarons. So good! Those soft, delicately sweet morsels with light melt-in-your mouth crusts were perfect companions for my afternoon tea. Personally, I prefer Moroco over Nadege. Maybe it's the more balanced level of sweetness that seemed to be just that little bit subtler. Perfection comes with a hefty price tag though: $2.85 for one and $34.75 for a dozen."}
{"text":"Saweet Jehusus...this place is fan-freakin-tastic. For sure it is girl heaven. It is pretty, chocolaty, pretty, you are treated like royalty, its pretty....   We went for brunch. I could get used to this kind of treatment. Strong mimosas, fantastic variety of pastries, perfectly done eggs, perfectly cooked (and not greasy at all) sausages, latkes with herb sour cream. All, heaven. Even the washrooms are amazingly clean and beautiful. The paper towels are thicker than some towels I have used.   Ladies...this is heaven in Yorkville. Go...soon..."}
{"text":"Cute ambience, very expensive chocolates and macarons  We had the macarons which were good but not out of this world fantastic. We wanted to do the Afternoon Tea  there but @ $55 a person, it was completely overpriced and not worth it for what you were getting. I'm all about splurging, esp for tea, but not at list of food items listed on the tea menu. It looked more like a $35 deal...if even.  And i've had plenty of afternoon teas in my lifetime"}
{"text":"Moroco has the best macarons in town, but it's the only restaurant in Toronto I've been that has a no stroller policy. In these days it's just stupid to offer an apparently pleasant place for lunch or even just coffee or tea and not allow parents to park there with an infant sleeping in the stroller. Can't give any more stars for a place that will just not let me in. (Worst, using stupid reasons such as 'we serve hot stuff so it's a hazard for kids' - really? Are all the other restaurants out there serving cold food only??)"}
{"text":"I think I have gone to chocolate heaven...Seriously!   My bf and I were intrigued to see what this place was really all about when we stumbled upon it on our journey through Toronto. At first we thought it was a chocolate shop, but then we noticed the chic restaurant that was located in the back of the shop. Before we could even see a menu, we were hooked by all the delicious meals we saw others eating (especially the smores). So even though we already had breakfast (they were only serving brunch) and the price tag was a bit steep for lunch, we decided to just go for it!  We opted to share the brunch taps - egg burritos, shrimp tacos, egg and cheese spring rolls, and frittatas. One thing was more delicious than the next. Our favorites were the spring rolls and egg burritos.   We then had to have the smores. Homemade marshmallows, gramcrackers, dark chocolate squares, with caramel and chocolate dipping sauce. YUMMY!!! This is when I thought I died and went to chocolate heaven. I highly recommend getting this dessert if you ever stop by for a bite. Again it's a bit pricey for what your getting ($22 for the dish) but it's totally worth the indulgement."}
{"text":"Came to Moroco with my boyfriend for a last-minute brunch in Yorkville as we were staying in the area.  My boyfriend had been to Moroco a few years prior and experienced a great meal, so I was excited to try it out.  First impression- The place is very chic!  Loved the decor (especially the patio- those macaroon-inspired pillows were too cute!).  We sat on the patio and ordered Shakshuka and the Avocado Benny.  My shakshuka came out very hot, but the portion was quite small.. I also found it to be on the salty side.  I had to request extra baguette slices as it only came with 3 thin slices, which was barely enough.  Overall, Moroco was nothing special, and I would hesitate to come back."}
{"text":"Not cheap, but the macarons are to die for! They have a little shop at the front where you can get some to go. Their seating area is very nice. I love the bathrooms here - definitely check them out if you are there!"}
{"text":"\"Peter? Peter? Where are you?\" Surely these are the gates of heaven. Lustrous glass shelves and counters teeming with some of the most exquisite looking chocolates I have seen, with names like \"Geisha\" and \"Flirt\", along with ephemeral french macaroons in the most delicate shades of pastels, and then, there, in the corner, a rich chocolate fountain in all its glory. And that's just the front room.  Then, peeking in further into this divine territory, I see a back room in whimsical black and whites-- a fairy tale hide-away for grown ups-- complete with a fireplace, a full bar, magical chandeliers, and a menu of delicacies like Strawberry Grilled Cheese, Truffled Mac and Cheese, and Butternut Squash Agnalotti..   I try the \"Mintjito\" chocolate, which is rich, with a darker filling then I anticipated with its name. It's seductive but almost too subtle for me. My son's raspberry macaroon, however, is perfect-- not too sweet, and melting away like a dream. We also try their smore-- nothing like the packaged, processed mess we assembled in grade school campfires-- the graham crackers are more like cinnamon cakes sandwiching a perfectly creamy marshmallow and enrobed in dark chocolate. The prices, however, are as decadent as the flavors. Good thing for me that this \"heaven\" is so far north!"}
{"text":"Love this place, been here numerous times.   It is a great place for afternoon tea.  Dinner menu is great too.   It's very chic, I enjoyed the tea service here better than Windsor Arms (I guess I like the younger vibe).   The chocolate is amazing (the chocolate covered marshmallows are my favourite).  I recommend the Truffle Mac&Cheese, it looks like a small portion, but it is rich and filling"}
{"text":"A fabulous place to sip chocolate and get high on sugar, in a good way.   They have the best macarons I've tasted out side of Paris or Parisian transplant stores like Pierre Hermé or Ladurée in London/Tokyo/etc..   Until I'd eaten many macarons I'd never realized that there could be such disparity in texture / flavour of the meringue shells and consistency / flavour of the fillings. MoRoCo's macarons deserve your repeated visits because of:   - Consistent quality! Getting macarons' meringue shells to be of a consistent quality must be quite tricky, one batch may be spot on and the next batch could be gluey and dense. Theirs have been consistently good.   - A good variety of flavours available every day: chocolate, vanilla, caramel with salt, pistachio, cassis blackcurrent, lemon, hazelnut, seasonal flavours like pumpkin in the fall, hopefully there is at least one that you like   - beautiful store, beautiful presentations"}
{"text":"I had my 18th birthday party held there because I am a chocolate fiend. We had dessert brunch complete with pastries, waffles, drinking chocolate, macarons and some other yummy items. The food was beyonnddd delicious omg, I still remember how everyone raved about the pastries and waffles.   I returned a few years later with very fond memories but was a little disappointed, maybe it was an off day im not sure but the tiramisu id ordered was a little too citrusy for my taste and the lady fingers part was a little stiff and stale tasting. The rose tea my friend and I had ordered however was absolutely divine."}
{"text":"Let me contribute with a limited male perspective on this place.  Ummm.. Moroco Chocolat would be the exact opposite of Hooters or some kind of sports bar.    I had the uhh.. lovely pleasure of being escorted by 6 lovely ladies after a lovely evening event in Yorkville to have a lovely spot of coffee and some lovely desserts, for a lovely good time at a lovely place here.  And to say I was a bit of a lovely fish out of some lovely water being the only lovely male in the group would be a lovely understatement.  Sure enough all ladies seemed to enjoy this place.  I on the other hand would have been fairly happy having my itsy bitsy teenie weenie banana eclair at Tim Hortons. Don't get me wrong, the lovely presented eclair was quite lovely, and we received lovely service but at a lovely $14?!?!?!  I know I'm not necessarily there just for the food, and was there as much to enjoy the decor, and my lovely company but I couldn't help but think that I'd rather have something from Xococava (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/xococava-toronto) for 1/4 of the price.  At the end of the day.. the place was quite... lovely.  But it just won't be receiving my love.  Lovely."}
{"text":"I drop in occasionally to indulge in a macaron or two. Disappointed yesterday when I purchased their new flavour \"praline\" on the recommendation of their staff. Usually their macarons are fresh and flavourful. This one was neither! Ended up with a stale bland tasting, what was supposed to be, a treat! Should have stuck with my \"regular\" lavender cassis and salted caramel!"}
{"text":"I came here to have desserts and left with some macarons. Loved the dine in experience, the macarons weren't that great though. They tasted somewhat artificial to me"}
{"text":"So today me and my friend went to see an art gallery opening and decided to stop by this shop for afternoon tea. We haven't been here before but the exterior looked inviting enough. Once in we can see that the decor was quite pretty but so were the prices. With $57 worth of high tea I was expecting something more. The sandwiches are the smallest I've seen and the scones took extra long to be served. None of the desserts were anything special either. The Kensington Market blend tea was amazing though and I would highly recommend it. Now, the food wasn't amazing but it did not warrant a two star. The service did though. No one asked whether we wanted our water refiled and we had no napkins nor plates to eat with in the beginning. As well, there was a sharing cost to the tea. The climax came when I went to the washroom and left my friend outside. She was eating the Mac and Cheese when a server came over and asked if he could clean the tables. My friend said ok, but wanted to continue eating the Mac and Cheese. Lo and behold, the server slams the finished jam onto the Mac and Cheese my friend was still eating and takes everything away. For a place the charges a fixed 18.5% gratuity, I was expecting much better service. The bill came out to be more than $100 for just one high tea and a cup of champaign. Definitely not coming back. It's not worth the money nor the tips. I paid a lower price at the Windsor Arms and got better food and service. What a disappointment."}
{"text":"MoRoCo Chocolat is a beautifully appointed restaurant and chocolate boutique that is inspired by the whimsical patisseries of Paris. I was invited to preview a tasting of the Valentine's Day menu and was most impressed by the delicious variety of dishes that I sampled. As you enter the boutique, chocolate of every type imaginable is displayed along the walls, while a colourful melange of macarons is set up at the front.   I was greeted by a friendly server who offered me a tiramisu martini. This sinful libation is like dessert in a glass and with the shot of espresso, it will keep you wired all night long! The amuse bouche of smoked eggplant resting on a crisp beet chip was a prelude of great things yet to come. The appetizer consisting of fried pork belly with Asian peanut slaw was tangy, crunchy and bursting with sweet and savoury flavours all at once. Seafood lovers will adore the beautifully plated pan seared scallops served with almond pea puree and pickled with watermelon radish and beet foam.  For the main course, I enjoyed the hearty and filling pork braised short ribs accompanied with root vegetable caponata. Moist and tender, the short ribs were enhanced with horseradish snow, a spicy and creamy counterpoint. Another option is the maple glazed black cod with Jerusalem artichokes, charred fennel and mushroom salad. Garnering high praise among my fellow diners was the beet ravioli served with creme fraiche and fennel. The filling of sweet beets are complemented nicely with the taste of fragrant and bold fennel.   No meal is complete without dessert and we were spoiled with not one, but two different desserts! The dulce de leche mousse is rich and with strawberry ice cream and vanilla and pistachio trifle. It is saccharinely sweet and creamy. The simply titled chocolate bar does not do justice to the fancy, inventive dessert that has been concocted for your pleasure. Milk chocolate snow, raspberry fluff and black crowberries meld perfectly to create the most decadently satisfying 'chocolate bar' dessert.     Prior to dining, I had the chance to prepare some macarons with some help from the restaurant's pastry chef. I loved the hands-on experience of piping ganache onto the meringue shells. My pistachio-raspberry creations were delicate and divine and I even got to take them home to share and enjoy.   While you may not be taking your sweetheart to the city of lights this Valentine's Day, bring the romance and culinary inspirations of Paris to your love by dining at MoRoCo Chocolat!  http://www.hipurbangirl.com/2016/02/moroco-chocolat-valentines-day-menu.html"}
{"text":"By far the best macarons I've ever had! It's always consistent and just the right consistency, never too crumbly and always fresh!"}
{"text":"After my poor experience here with there food - I came for dessert and was pleasantly surprised. It does specialize in desserts, and it was delicious."}
{"text":"I went there for a girlfriend's bachelorette and the service was terrible! We went on a  sunny Saturday afternoon, it wasn't too busy and they were well staffed. They came to take our orders after an hour since we were seated. We did flag down a waiter and all she said was, \"okay,\" and walked away. After our orders were taken, we waited yet almost another hour before our tea pots and fondue arrived. To be quite honest the food did not make up for the long wait. The fondue for 4 consist of a little bit of pretzels, grapes, banana slices, their homemade marshmallow and marcaron disks. Tiny portions and very much overpriced. What took them so long to make the tea and fondue? It seems like everything is prepared and all you have to do is plate. I Will Not Recommend This Place To Anyone!"}
{"text":"This place revels in how Yorkville it is.  After sushi + ice cream, my dear friend (Mariko M) asked me if I wanted to check out this place.  I'm like \"Sure, I could go for a hot tea.\"  Um.  This place is no regular coffeeshop.  This is a coffeeshop that old, rich men take their hot, young girlfriends to.  This is a place where women and gay men with no children and incomes significantly over the national average come to for gossip & people watching.  $10 for a pot of tea?  $7 for a small latte? $26 for dark chocolate fondue for 2?  Staff dressed all in white - except for the only non-white staff who was dressed in black (awkward).  Only Yorkville.  A hot male server whose sexuality Mariko M. & I debated about?  Only Yorkville.  It was wonderful, I people watched enough to last me until I've saved enough for an actual meal @ Moroco.  Let's say, some hot tea & splitting a fondue cost me more than my dinner & ice cream combined.  Was it good fondue?  Yes.  Was it fondue I would regularly pay $26 for?  HELLZ NO!!    But if in Yorkville, go to Moroco & bask in the glory of the luxury cars & sugar daddies & people with jobs that you want."}
{"text":"Have come here couple times and enjoyed the dining experience for both dinner and dessert. The truffle mac & cheese is delicious, and is very rich! On my last trip, the macarons were not that great, but this time, the macarons were a lot tastier, and tasted much more fresh and delicious! For dessert we had cappuccinos and tea, the artisinal tea is very lovely, and enjoy having the tea chest to look at and discover different teas. We had something that was a dulce de leche and mascarpone stuffed puff pastry, it was absolutely fantastic! They did some changing with their menu, which I was a little annoyed as I couldn't find the blondie dessert I usually get, but this dessert was so delicious, especially if you are a salted caramel fan! Like others, the added gratuity for below mediocre service, is pretty dreadful/annoying, specifically when the restaurant is not busy at all, you're expecting okay service. Overall, the ambience and atmosphere of this little place is really nice, the dessert and tea is lovely, just be prepared for not the best service."}
{"text":"I had occassion to go to MoRoCo this past Sunday. I took my very British mother for afternoon tea. This place has been reccommended to me by a number of people. We have had high tea at a few other locations. In my opinion, better places than MoRoCo.   First, you are warned when you book a high tea reservation to eat lunch that day (high tea starts at 2:30 p.m.). Interesting. The reason? For $55 for full tea, you get four finger sandwhiches, some petit fours, three very small scones and some preserves, lemon curd and devon creme. Cumulatively, one small plate of food if everything were confined to one plate. Although the food is rich, buttery and chocolate-laden, it is still expensive.   The food was good, I'll give it that. Our actual server was also good, though no better or worse than a server at a non-Yorkville establishment would be.   My problem was with my exit. I had made the reservation two days prior and confirmed it the following day. I had to provide a credit card number to secure my reservation, as though it was a hotel room. When I was leaving, a female staff member (hostess perhaps) quite literally chased me down yelling \"Wait!\". I thought I had forgotten something at my table.   No- apparently, I had some form of verbal contract with MoRoCo which I had deviated from. When I made a high tea reservation for 3 and my husband later decided to order from their brunch menu instead of the tea menu, I was advised not to worry for this time, but that they had prepared all of the tea foods in advance which had now been wasted.   Interesting for many reasons. The most obvious being that there are tea options- including a cream tea or a high tea. I did not at any time specify which one I would be ordering. I don't usually decide what I want to eat two days in advance. Maybe I'm weird.   Anyway, the gist of my review is that while the food is good (not great, but good), it's overpriced (even compared to it's High Tea neighbours like the Windsor Arms and The King Edward Hotel, etc.), it's minimal proportions and to top it off, the management is downright rude to customers who just spent $150 on $5 worth of food."}
{"text":"PROS: -Beautiful decor and desserts to match. The little shop at the entrance is super cute. The bathrooms are swanky too. A tad pretentious but it is in Yorkville afterall.   -Unique desserts with a twist. Not just a plain old cheesecake but rather deep fried or something to make it special.   -I think I go there moreso for the little shop to buy cute gifts.   CONS: -I had the Ahi Tuna salad and it was pretty meh.  Have dinner elsewhere and go here for dessert.   OVERALL: -Cute place for a girls night out!"}
{"text":"OK, so, not *fantastic* as far as the food goes, but this place really tickled me in virtue of its whimsical Alice in Wonderland Gone Goth décor.  Deep, plush purple loveseats, black velvet trompe-l'oeuil wallpaper with white molding, white porcelain accent pieces, dim lighting -- all in, one of the most well designed \"more is more\" spaces I've eaten in for quite some time.  The duck confit spring rolls were amusing and tasty, the scallops were nicely seared, the mini sliders were flavourful, and the glasses of shiraz and malbec did the trick just fine.  I had no room left for dessert (I know, I know ...) so now I have a ready excuse to go back ... which I will, and soon."}
{"text":"The first time I came here, I was walking around on yorkville with my google maps app open on my iPhone and still could not find the place! I walked back and forth and back and forth, lol silly me. Finally in the end, realized that it was in an alley way.  After realizing the actual location was hidden within an alley way, I walked in and saw the beautiful storefront with a pretty patio. The little door was on the left of the place and as soon as I walked in I was in awe of the beautifully decorated displays of sugary confections.   I choose half a dozen of macarons (around $20) and was on my way out, did not have time to try the restaurant food, but the menu looks delicious.  I have been back about 4 times to grab more macarons while at the yorkville area shopping, but still must try the restaurant out.  The lady at the macaron counter was so sweet and helpful and waited patiently for me to choose the flavours. The macarons are pretty good (but a bit pricey, 20 bucks for 6 small sweet treats) they have really good flavour, best in the area, but there is another shop a bit more north of the city I prefer more (see other review)"}
{"text":"Got tricked by the fake menu on the Toronto.ca summerlicious webpage ... We though there would be lamb and. Chocolate pasta ... And What's actually on the menu in store is a lot less attractive .. Orders come out slow .. Waitress don't remember what each ordered .. Thou she's very nice. Anyways do not recommend coming here for dinning at all nor lunch. Dessert would be ok I guess."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of dropping in this afternoon. What a treat! I walk along Yorkville many, many times yet I have never noticed this tucked in establishment. Fortunately, I had a friend take me here.  Service was fantastic. We were served by a Mike who was very attentive and brought us water whenever our glass was empty. The place itself is quite aesthetically pleasing with funky beats in the background prepared by an on-site DJ. The frozen hot chocolate was great!  I would definitely come back. :)"}
{"text":"when i first walked in, i was so wowed by the way this place looked.. ordered \"hot mess\" martini was very very good..  but this is where the points were taken off, FOOD.... it was below average for that kind of place, in my opinion, it was a shame i had mushroom soup which was great, but nicoise salad was pretty sad... my friend had steak sandwich, he said it was so blend.. loved the hot chocolate and the chocolate, they should really stick to that.. will be back for sure, but not for the food"}
{"text":"the 2 stars is not a reflection on quality of product or decor or anything like that... its just waaay too over priced... the truffles, the macaroons or the brunch... just way too pricey... i guess thats why its filled with young 20 something girls babbling incessantly and haggard yorkville matrons holding court..."}
{"text":"Came here three times. Twice to purchase the macarons outside the store and once where I actually sat in for tea time. MoRoCo macarons are HUGE, so they do cost slightly more than the average macarons. One of the better Macarons in Toronto, MoRoCo is located in a fairly wealthy neighbourhood. You need to purchase at least 6 macarons to attain a box if you collect boxes! The shop also sells many chocolate treats, I found the chocolate shaped like a bone fairly humorous because it's called \"boyfriend treats\". MoRoCo also sells soft marshmallows.  Coming in to sit down one time, MoRoCo is designed very beautifully, with \"princess\" chairs. We wanted to order their high tea, but we then learned that we needed to make reservations 24 hours ahead of time online. So, instead, I got on of their chocolate items, I go the smore.  The chocolate tasted on the sweet side and the marshmallow was very sweet but delicious. I think overall, the treat was very sweet and very filling to eat. My friend who got the macaroni and cheese said hers was very salty and filling, but after eating such a sweetening item, eating a bite of the mac and cheese tasted REALLY GOOD.    I would recommend sharing their items as they feel very filling. Also, make reservations for high tea! It's about $50 per person for high tea here."}
{"text":"This review is on their retail shoppe and macarons, not the actual restaurant.  I decided to stop in for a treat while I was in the neighborhood. The shop is at the entrance of the restaurant and is quite white and bright - opposite from the dimly lit restaurant. Showcased on several shelves and display cases are house made marshmallows, s'mores-to-go, chocolates, & macarons. The macarons are the first thing you see when you enter the store. They are colorful and cute in their display and you are immediately drawn to them. I purchased a pack of 12 and holy hell they were $38 but of course I wanted to try every flavor and sometimes a girl just has to treat herself.  The service at the shoppe was good. The staff member greeted us right away and assisted us immediately. There wasn't anything spectacular about the service: they were friendly and the transaction was processed quickly.   In terms of taste the macarons are decent. They are definitely not the best in Toronto but one of the better ones. I found the texture of the macarons to be very chewy. Maybe too chewy for my liking. I prefer macarons to have a bit of a crunch at first bite with just a little bit of chewiness, which I did not experience with these guys. The flavor was pretty good but not great. They certainly tasted like what they were supposed to taste but nothing really wowed me. The flavor selection wasn't as vast as I had hoped and expected it to be, sticking mainly to staples such as chocolate, vanilla, caramel, red velvet, etc it was kind of disappointing that they didn't offer more unique and interesting flavors. There was a \"black sesame\" flavored macaron but I found this one to be OK at best - sweet in the middle with the cream filling with a slightly bitter aftertaste. I think this would probably be best served with a latte to balance the taste. My favourite macaron of the ones I selected was the pistachio. I liked this one because it stayed true to its flavor without being too overpowering. The cream filling and meringue shells had a nice subtle pistachio taste. It was not too sweet and a nice light dessert snack. The packaging was also unique and crush proof. The macarons are placed in a box with a plastic tray inside that had little grooves for the macarons to sit on. When I took them out of the box I was pleased to find that they were all still in tact.  Overall, my experience at the Moroco Chocolat boutique was just OK. I think the macarons are overpriced considering their flavor selection wasn't that great and the taste was not outstanding. You can get better ones or ones that are equally good for cheaper at other patisseries. Perhaps next time I will try their house made chocolates and/or marshmallows."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere, beautiful decorations - this place takes you away from the real world. The food is unique and delicious. My husband tried Truffled Mac'n'Cheese and loved it. Their dessert is the reason to go there: I shared S'Mores with my sister, not only was it delicious but we also got to make them! They brought out a portable flame machine for us to melt the marshmallows so it added to the whole experience. If you haven't been it is a must. It's romantic and unique. Service was ok, but the ambiance makes up for it."}
{"text":"MoRoCo Chocolat tries to be the Ladurée of Toronto. The place is lovely, the decor is very trendy and you feel like being in Gossip Girl.  For sunday bruch there is a DJ playing electro-lounge music while customers order chocolate fondues.   This is one of the most luxirious and show-off place of Yorkville. People come there come with Chanel bags or Louboutin shoes. So if you want to have a casual brunch in that area, this not the place.  Now, let's speak about their macarrons... When you know Pierre Hermé (+++) or Ladurée (++)  and try something else, you are always disappointed. Well, the macaroons are good but not stunning, you better try those of Pusaterie's or La Bohème. Everything on the menu is very pricey, the food is average but the presentation and plates disposal is very pretty.   MoRoCo is a nice place to good to have a girls brunch and feel like Blair Waldorf and her friend Serene Van Woodsen."}
{"text":"Garbage. This place is meant for women since women get satisfied from how a place looks and feels. Not the actual food. The food is overpriced and at the end you all be wondering 'when do we get to eat'. Don't forget the mandatory 18.5% tip."}
{"text":"Very nice place and ambiance. Prices are expensive. For a Wednesday night, the service was very slow.  Wasn't that impressed with the macaroons."}
{"text":"The chocolate fondue service is so much fun and so delicious, I'd do it every day if I had the time, money, or metabolism for it. I'd recommend coming here after a busy day of shopping/exploring around Yorkville or Toronto with friends or family (even with kids, as long as they're well-behaved!) just to unwind in a warm, fun spot at the end of the day. The only other thing [other than the fondue] I've tried here are the macarons which are so0o0o delicious. The staff is lovely and the place itself is so beautiful. It's the kind of place where you sit there just sort of contently smiling at yourself because it's just... lovely. I can't think of another word for it.   It's a little bit pricey, but you pay for the quality of the service and fare, so this isn't so much a complaint as it is a mild warning -- you'll spend a little more per person here than you would usually for a dessert/coffee date."}
{"text":"Beautiful venue, nice atmosphere, good eats and drinks....but the service was disappointing. This place seems to take customers based on appearance and image more than when you arrive. A group of us arrived minutes before another group and we were told that there was no availability or reservations for later...but the following walk in group was seated right after with a choice of inside or patio seats. The patio was less than half full and inside had ample empty tables. We walked outside and I called in to their desk and easily made reservations for 30 minutes later. When our group showed back up 30 minutes later, we were treated poorly and certainly differently from their usual level of customer service received in the past and that day to other patrons.  I don't want to speculate reasons for this but we were a diverse group of 20-30s male and female from various ethnic backgrounds with multiple accents and some dressed more casually than others. I sincerely hope this was an isolated incident as it would be a shame that such a lovely place has such lack of respect for its patrons."}
{"text":"Like a HOT date that turned SOUR!   It was love at first sight! Beautiful & Stylish & Sexy!  It's Boutique Chic meets Gothic Glam! Everything in the interior reflected an all black/white/lavender color scheme. The atmosphere was high society and all-things-pretty! There were glass chandeliers, animal prints, faux fur, glossy white figurines, mirrored walls, and fancy tufted velvet plush seating. I felt like a modern day princess for the afternoon!  We started out with Brunch and ordered the Eggs Benny. $19 each and comes with a very small side of mixed greens. Mark got the Peameal & Cheese while I went for the Avocado & Tomato. Two poached eggs with creamy avocado salsa and spicy Aioli sauce. The Aioli had a surprisingly sharp zesty kick! Loved that surprise! And for once, the English muffin on the bottom of the benny was NOT soggy! Hooray!!! It was definitely the BEST BENNY I've had in town - so far! THAT did it! Now I couldn't WAIT to get to dessert!   We went for the $28 Dessert Tasting Platter: \"Rich Enough to Twitch\". With 4 different treats (panna cotta, tiramisu, sticky coffee pudding, blondie bar). When they arrived at the table, each treat was a beautifully crafted culinary artwork! I was so excited to dig in!   Sadly, with each bite, I was more and more disappointed. I was so unimpressed with this desert platter, I couldn't take another bite. And that is RARE! For a place known for their desserts and for $28 for small sample sizes, that's unacceptable. For that price, they really need to justify it.   The bill for 2 bennies & 1 dessert platter with tax & 18% tip rang up to $90.   Sadly, it will be a WHILE until this modern-day-princess-wannabe comes back here. *POUT*"}
{"text":"This was yet another stop on my quest for Toronto's best truffles...and damn were they good. I was a little surprised at how fancy this place is, it seems like it's also a full service restaurant, although I can't comment about the food.  Result: Good truffles, awesome hot chocolate, and hefty prices. The truffles are $2.75 each, the priciest I've seen so far and the hot chocolate is $5 for 4 ounces I believe. Although the prices are somewhat scary, if you're a chocolate lover you owe this place a visit and if it's cold, definitely splurge for some hot chocolate :)"}
{"text":"MoRoCo is a chocolate salon like none other. First, the entire staff looks as if they just participated in a walk-off on the set of Zoolander that ended in a TIE. Not only is the staff beautiful to look at, the decor is luxurious and chic. And if this gorgeous visual arsenal isn't enough, the sweets are FANTABULOUS.   This place was the last stop on Rita E's Great Macaron Crawl of 2010, and saving the fanciest place for last was definitely appropriate. Rita, Jon K and I each ordered two macarons; Rita and I had a little booze to accompany our sweets. I chose a mocha and a vanilla macaron, and they were both good. I like the size of the macarons here; they're about three times the size of your typical macaron. Since you get more than a couple bites, the pleasure of eating one isn't as fleeting as it normally is; however, the macaron isn't so large that you get sick of eating it by the time you're done. I especially enjoyed the vanilla, which was nicely creamy and bursting with true vanilla flavor.   For my libation, I chose a Frozen Chocolate Martini in Chocolate Rush, which was made from Valhrona chocolate, Bailey's, amaretto and cream. It tasted like a slightly boozy, melted chocolate milkshake. Absolutely delicious and perfect for such a warm day. I could have had about four of them, but at $16 a drink (!), it's probably not a good move. :)  Service from the gorgeous fem- and man-bots was just okay; we had to flag down our servers to get our water refilled, and the water wasn't really cold. (Normally, I'm not the type to complain about water but when you're eating super-sweet things, the water shouldn't be in short supply!).   What a great place for dessert. The prices may make you want to barf into your (faux) Hermes Birkin bag, but the sheer deliciosity and fabulous atmosphere makes MoRoCo a worthwhile visit."}
{"text":"Part Alice in Wonderland, part Bordello but all awesome. Not the most masculine place, in fact it almost screams \"Girls Only!\", so better for an estrogen laden night or brunch than say a mixer. Also this place is heavy on the sweets with a wild assortment of amazing desserts and chocolates so diabetics be wary. The non dessert options like the Mac n Cheese and the club are absolutely scrumptious, especially when accompanied by a glass of champagne or if you're feeling extra decadent Champagne beer and they actually do proper tea w/ canapes and scones on a daily - a MUST for any Anglophile."}
{"text":"I have walked in once before months ago to check it out. Thought it was a cute place. After checking their macaron and tasted one, I knew its not the right place to be buying that particular item from which is fine as in Toronto there are about only 2 places I trust for macaron so i was not opposed to coming here once day and experience something else.  This past Saturday my cousin and I had an amazing lunch at a near by place and decided to have coffee and dessert some where else and we sadly decided to come here. The host was nice to seat us after asking if we had a reservation! Seriously?? We were given 2 menus. One for the tea and one for whatever else they serve. I personally couldn't read anything. I am 34 and wear no glasses and have nothing wrong with my eyes but whoever picked that font for the menu is either mean or ....... It took them 25mins after we received the menu to take our order after we demanded attention. The tea selection has everything in it but the demanded and expected.....selection of god knows what but no basic ginger, mint, black or sage.....comes in a big silver thing with the leafs in it with out anything to remove them. so once you get the tea to the color and taste of your liking and have a cup you need to add hot water cause its darker by the time.  The adam and eve apple \"dessert\" and as mentioned by the waiter takes 15min to prepare and it did take 20min.....it looked like a mess and tasted nothing better than a Mc apple pie.  A waiter pouring water was obviously suffering from a bad cold. The management should have given him the day off.  Do not charge me Four Season prices and have dollar store spoons and water glasses.  I can confidently say that if this place did not step up their game and are open for another couple of years then their customers must be stupid."}
{"text":"I came here last Sunday with my family for brunch. I had fantastic service and the food was great. I had Chicken Waffles and my family had Avocado Benny and the Rosti pancakes with salmon.  The portions were great and the prices reasonable for Yorkville. They had a bacon chocolate bar, which I bought a tried later. I thought it was unique and I liked it.  The decor is very beautiful and I hear the owner designed everything herself. I would definitely come back again. However, the place is rather girly and cute. So I would be coming back with my family and not my guy friends..."}
{"text":"I ate here during Summerlicious 2014 with two other friends. We liked the idea that this place also offered high tea options and wanted to try it out.  Ambience The interior had a modern Victorian look. Black white and purple. It looked pleasing to the eye. One wall is decorated with celebrity photos and their chocolate hand prints. The patio had white furniture with macaron throw pillows. The Music that played was mostly fashion runway-like which doesn't fit my image of a tea place. The table we got was pretty tiny. It was barely able to fit 3 plates and waters not to mention the additional teapot and teacups.  Service I would say service was pretty standard. One noticeable difference: for every course, the waitress would clear out all plates and cutlery rather than just plates only. The waitress was friendly and chatted a little bit with us. My one Big complaint is she mislead us to believe sharing a teapot would come at no extra cost. Actually it was an additional $3/person for an extra teacup and macaron.  Would have been nice if she made that clear to begin with. Delivery of food was pretty quick until dessert. By that time, most of the lunch crowd has gone yet it took an especially long time. The waitress notified us after waiting some time but I don't think that makes up for it. On the bill 18.5% gratuity... Which was decided by the cafe. Are you kidding?! Here is a taste of the Menu:  Appetizer Soup du jour (kale & leek) - this was actually a substantial amount of soup compared to the other salad options. - it tasted good and the flavors were subtle Goat cheese salad - the goat cheese medallion makes this dish worth it. - the sharp taste of the cheese is balanced by the neutral salad. Kale Salad (I ate most of this) -This salad was mostly leaves and a sprinkle of nuts, cranberries & parm. Disappointing - the bitterness of the kale is balanced  by the cheese and cranberries. Too bad those are scarce to find and not enough when digging in (it sinks to the bottom). I couldn't taste the vinegarette.  Main Beef sliders - You get 2 miniscule sliders and a salad (again?). I ate half of one, but didn't get any sauce and the meat was pretty dry. Quiche of the day - it comes with a salad (again?) And the quiche was the size of Truffle Mac and cheese (I ate most of this) - By far, the most volume but seems very cheap to make and came with no sides. I could not really taste truffle. It was a rich savoury Mac and cheese and I liked it of course because it was like comfort food.  Dessert Very berry Cheese cake (I ate most of this) - This seemed like something bought frozen in a supermarket.  - It was sweet but also tart due to the sauce.  - The cookie layer was pretty mushy ugh. Presentation was nice although technically, it was a plain cheesecake with blueberries and sauce on the side. Dulce de Leche Mousse Cake - Chocolate goodness but thin slice Lemon Custard Flan - I liked how distinct the lemony taste was. The sourness was more bearable than the berry cheese cake  Extras Pot of tea with a macaron $10 + $3/ add. Cup You are given a tea box to choose which tea to get. I found it disappointing that most selections were from Davids Tea. The price of this was so unbelievably expensive although look pretty."}
{"text":"MoRoCo Chocolat was one of our stops in our quest for the best macarons in Toronto.  My sister had to pull me out of this place 'coz it was just so darned pretty!  I thought I died and went to dessert heaven!  There were so many fabulous desserts to try, but we controlled ourselves and focused on the macarons, which were displayed in a glass encasing like jewels at Tiffany's. I have to say, after visiting 10 macaron shops in the GTA, MoRoCo macarons are in my top 3. Perfect foot, perfect shell, perfect filling, perfect bite. I love their salted caramel, passionfruit and cassis flavours!    I'll definitely come back here to satisfy my macaron cravings, but also for date night at the lounge with my hubby. The ambiance is wonderful, the staff is very accommodating, but most of all, the desserts are to die for. Love MoRoCo!"}
{"text":"I went to MoRoCo today and sampled a dozen or so of their truffles.  Overall, quite nice!  Visually, they were shiny with colorful designs.  In terms of flavor, truffles involving spices or herbs (e.g. cardamom, curry, chai, basil, etc.) were more successful in terms of harmony and balance of the flavors.  I may actually have preferred a bit more spice in some of them.  Truffles involving fruits (orange, raspberry, passionfruit, cherry, etc.) were a little too tart, which was overpowering on the palate.  Physically, the exteriors were of appropriate thickness (quite thin) but were a little too hard and brittle.  Often, the shell would separate from the interior after being bitten, and I would feel the sharp edges of the chocolate on my tongue.  The fillings themselves had an appropriate range of textures, with only one or two being too sticky or thick.  The girl who helped me out was knowledgeable about their line of truffles, and also about their development process (which truffles had recently been improved, which ones were currently under review).  She was also very enthusiastic about chocolate and conspicuously cheerful."}
{"text":"Dining Experience: Dinner/Dessert Specialty: Desserts Menu items: The Melteaser and All Wrapped Up!  I have to confess, I was a bit hesitant to review MoRoCo Chocolat on the blog given feedback from fellow bloggers stating disappointing customer experiences. Furthermore, I myself am not impressed with their selection of savory dishes. That said, I do find their desserts glorifying, their decor superb and thankfully have not had a bad service, yet. So today, I will only comment on the sweets and the ambiance, which made MoRoCo worthy of a post.  MoRoCo is a cute, high-end cocoa bar located in the affluent Yorkville area. To get to the restaurant, you first have to get through their chocolate boutique. The boutique works as a separate retail space featuring truffles, chocolates, macaroons and all other kinds of delicious chocolaty treats, including at times ice-cream. This is my favourite part of the place, it's like an appetite opening room that gets you ready for what its about to come!  When you enter the restaurant, you feel like you've just entered the set of the Marie-Antoinette movie. The decor is Louis XVI époque meets Yorkville. The end result? Comfy purple velvet chairs and sofas, crystal chandeliers, luxurious wall mirrors and over-the-top decoration.  The desserts? Well, these are just like the decor. Decadent, luxurious and over-the-top. The Melteaser is a clear representation of that. The Melteaser is a ball-shaped cocoa shell filled with frozen yogurt and berries,  and it also comes with a little pot of hot chocolate. If I didn't know better, I could have easily thought this was their version of a kinder egg and that a surprise would be there once I cracked it. Little did I know I was in for an even greater treat.  The purpose of the hot chocolate is to use it to melt the top of the shell. As one pours it, the top of the shell starts melting and the goodies inside start to take form. Because the frozen yogurt, is well, frozen, this hot sauciness also aids to defrost it faster. After that, it is just you and a spoon on the journey...to chocolate heaven! Obligatory notation about the dessert: it's luxurious not only because of price ($18), but because the Chef decided to seat the Cocoa shell on what looked like  pearls; which are just candy covered style rice cake balls. Like I said, MoRoCo goes all out.  So now that I am all Wrapped Up! in their desserts (pun intended), I can not help but continue to taste some more. Once again, over-the-top and good! I was particularly impressed with the All Wrapped Up! dessert mainly because I am not a cheesecake fan, especially if it does not have chocolate in it. However, this version just did it for me. As MoRoCo puts it -\"Imagine a place where caramel cheesecake is all wrapped up in a crunchy buttery phyllo, served warm and finished with caramelized apples.\" SOLD!  MoRoCo also offers great tea variety, and to their favour, they serve tea the proper way. Letting the leaves sit and settle on the hot pot and then letting you pour your tea in small amounts to your cup, straining the leaves as you pour. With the tea set they bring, they give you a plate to dispose of the leaves. Accompanied with a macaroon, tea is yet another exclusive experience at this cocoa bar.  Buen Provecho, Viviana"}
{"text":"So, below is is original review, which was accompanies by 4 stars, however I've decided to revise it.   As I said below, when I went to Moroco, it was expensive, but very delicious for a treat. So I decided that I wanted to have my birthday dessert there. I called up to make a reservation for about 10 people. I was informed that for groups of over ten, there is a requirement that every person spends $48!   I kept the reservation for a day to see how many people were actually going to confirm coming out, but since everyone confirmed, I had to call back and cancel my reservation, because I do not want my guests to be obliged to spend $50 on dessert, after we have already had dinner! The girl on the phone said that it usually worked out, because once people had dessert and a drink, it worked out to be enough. As I said below, let's round up and say dessert is $20...so she's saying their drinks are $28!??!   I have wanted to go to Moroco for my birthday since the summer, but that was before I realized how pretentious they are! No thanks! Chocolate is great there, but only go with a couple of people, otherwise you'll have to pay the price!  * * * * *  (Original reviews: Oh my gosh, this place is to DIE for. It's also crazy expensive! This isn't a \"daily treat during the work day\" place, it's a \"I'm celebrating something and want a very special treat\" place. Deserts are around the $18/person range.  That said, the atmosphere was amazing. The place is all in black and white and looks/feels very trendy. The desserts though....WOW. Amazing! Chocolate fondue that is heavenly!   Anyway, I've decided that this is where I want to go for my birthday dinner. Forget conventional dinner. I want a sampler platter of desserts and no sharing and no judgment!)"}
{"text":"Gorgeous interior, very chic and elegant, incredibly thick rich hot chocolate.  Great menu, a bit pricey, but wonderful for afternoon tea with girlfriends, or special occasions.  Service was nice and friendly.  Love going back...just for the chocolate."}
{"text":"The macarons here are just okay for me. A bit pricier in comparison to other macaron shops in Toronto. I also tried this place for a winterlicious dinner too and found the food to be very greasy.    I think MoRoCo is over-hyped, they need to redo their menu or get a new chef. Something to improve the quality of food and justify the prices. For now, if I need Macarons...I would rather go to Nadege, Butter Avenue or Delysees."}
{"text":"oh .. yeaah NO!  Few things that other yelpers pointed out that i can verify:  1) This place does think very highly of themselves and has a very pretentios vibe to it (adding $$ for the same size of serving just because there is another person with you, 18.5% automatically adding gratuity)  2) Music is loud and doesn't go with the atmosphere.  Service (Disastrous):  We made a reservation for 9:00pm on the phone and was specifically asked if we were gonna have a dinner, to which we said yes.  Got there at 9:15, they didn't have our reservation, the server said \"yeah, sometimes the reservation goes for another day, no worries, we have two seats for you\".  We sat down, got the menu and asked for dinner items; the server said they are not serving dinner items anymore since the kitchen closes at 9:00, we said we were specifically asked about this, so he said wait a minute and goes off to check our reservation?  Really? why would you go check our reservation, if we had reservation would you have served us? if yes, then isn't it your fault that our reservation wasn't there to begin with?  He came back after checking his computer and says he couldn't find our reservation and can't serve dinner items. No remediation for their messup. I mean, i get better service at my local burger shop.  Alright, we get up and go to a different restaurant for dinner and came back for desserts (I wouldn't have if I was alone)  We got seated on the same table again, the waterglass had our marks from the last time, they didn't even clean it in 2 hours.  Food: I'd say the desserts were mediocre, we had chocolate fondue, cheese cake and tea. I have had better chocolate fondue (BB cafe) and cheese cakes in other places, so nothing unique there. The tea, however, was really good, only thing worth coming back for imo.  TL;DR - Remember kids, if the service is good, it will shine in unusual situations."}
{"text":"This was my second time at MoRoCo and this time was for friend's birthday. A bunch of us came for brunch and not for their popular afternoon tea sets (the first time I was here.. I had their afternoon tea, which is something i would recommend!)  So... We were actually late for our reservation due to the ridiculous construction closures in the area; however the restaurant was nice enough to wait for us. When we got there, we were promptly seated. I was quite surprised that the place was pretty empty, but believe me, this place fills up fast so reservations are highly recommended.  Anyways, once we were seated, the server bought over the tea selection box. There are more than 20 teas we could choose from which reminded us of David's Tea. I chose the Fujian White Rose while my two friends chose something from the chocolate tea section- mint chocolate and mayan chocolate truffle. My other two friends ordered a latte and a frozen hot chocolate (which was okay, accordingly to my friend) After little while after ordering our drinks, the server came with individualized tea pots, which added to the dining experience. All drinks come with one macaroon and we all got something different that matched with our tea or coffee beverage. You can also purchase macaroons and chocolate at their store located at the front of the restaurant.  Now with what I ordered: - Peameal & Cheese Benny- this breakfast favourite was good, but not great! The one important thing about the dish- the poached egg was not at all runny and too well-done. The peameal was a bit dry imo, but since I think we were all hungry, we ate it pretty quickly - Red velvet Pancakes-  These pancakes were so delicious! The pancakes were complimented with sweet blueberries and strawberries drizzled with light creamy goodness lol! To be honest, the presentation of this could be a little better as the plate they had used was a little big, but the dish was overall very good. *just to note, my friend and I were sharing the two dishes; and the portions was just right*  Lastly, the birthday girl wanted fondue so we ordered it after our brunch. We chose the 99% dark chocolate fondue and it came with bananas, grapes, marshmallows, pretzels and macaroon shells for dipping. We shared this between the 5 of us, which was just right especially after our main meal. The only down side of this was the chocolate was not heated; but just came melted.  I definitely would come here for the high tea, dessert and  the experience; but brunch is just alright. I do think that this is one of the better high tea places as I did not really enjoy the high tea at Windsor Arms.  By the way, I have to mention the decor as it was super girly and purple, which I absolutely love!"}
{"text":"We had dessert here today after a fail dinner, and I had such a pleasant time here. The staff is so friendly and loved the ambiance. We had the Black tie Affair (choco cake) and a frozen hot chocolate and it was pretty decent. But I loved the tea they served me.. something with detox on the name. Anyway, quite a pricey place especially for the small menu we got but you pay for the ambiance and service more than anything else. I recommend going here if you want to take your posh friend(s) for some brunch or dessert, just dont expect too much on the food because its a hit or miss in my opinion."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars.  Located in Yorkville this place just screams (ok quietly whispers) luxury.  Walk through the small store in the front that sells chocolates in bars, in shapes (skulls, buddhas, etc) and you get to the restaurant.  Darkly lit in that sexy way and nice plush chairs this place makes you want to sit up straight and practice your best manners.    Dark wallpaper with these gold designs on them and wall art that is lots of celebrity hand prints that were dipped in chocolate along with a accompanying picture of chocolate covered hands lends to a cute and fun vibe to the place.  Today we went for lunch.  I must say I am actually surprised with their lunch pricing (as well as brunch pricing). It's actually pretty decent.  My friend had the burger with sweet potato fries and that was $14!  I had the savoury crepes with a salad and that was only $18!  Not bad considering it's Yorkville and I really liked my crepes but it could have been a tiny bit more savour.  My friend's burger was really delicious - it had a lovely sauce and cheese on it and actual burger was nice and juicy.    The service was so lovely - everyone was nice and polite.  Our meal I guess took a bit longer to come out (although t be honest we didn't really notice) and the server apologized.   Now the only issue I have is that I can't figure out why the dessert pricing is so off.  I had the olive oil cake with blueberry compote and lemon cream.  The cake itself was a bit more dense that I prefer but with the sauces tasted ok.  You could really taste the lemon in the cream - and it tasted like real fresh lemons...not like lemon juice poured into it.  But that cost me $13!  Almost the price of my friend's burger!  It was a pretty big piece but still....  I also wanted some tea afterwards so the server brought over their tea boxes so we could decide.  He advised us to smell them (loose leaf).  There's also a description of each tea.  We chose a pot of the Magic Lychee and it was such a lovely flavour - you could really taste the lychee - not too strong but not so light that you just get a hint.  The pot cost $10....but we each probably got 3 cups out of it.  But here's the confusing part...to get another tea cup cost $3?!!  Seriously....I already paid for the pot...why on earth would I have to pay for another ta cup.  If I had known that I would have just shared my one tea cup with my friend!  The bill automatically adds 18.5% gratuity (strange since we were only a party of 2).   They do brunch on the weekends and high tea.  I saw some groupons for high tea so check that out.  In the summer they have a lovely patio out front so maybe then I will try brunch - but no desserts!"}
{"text":"I was looking for macarons while I went back to Toronto and Moroco was in the area where my dad worked..... so I travelled down to Yorkville and did some window shopping, while searching for this cute little specialty bakery / chocolate cafe.  You can easily miss it as it is tucked away in between buildings but once you see their beautiful sign, you'll smile ear to ear. As I walked in, you see the front part as a little bakery, while a cafe was tucked in the back with the patio out front that you can sit and enjoy the sun.  On the side, they offer complimentary water containing lemon/ lime and orange flavours while you browse at the wonderful colours and macaron towers. The macarons are displayed in rows, three to four flavours in each, three cases in total for 10 flavours to choose from. You can buy half a dozen for $15 dollars. After a tough tough decision, I chose the following:  Cappacino, Lemon, Lavender Cassis, Coconut, Passion Fruit, and a recommended Lime Sea Salt.  They were extremely moist, and full of flavour... (not the passionfruit, which was unfortunate). They definitely lived up to my expectations although they were overly sweet. I am learning how to make macarons and I thought mine were sweet.. but these were S.W.E.E.T.  Definitely worth a try if you're in the neighbourhood. If you buy more than 6, remember that the macarons should be eaten within 2 days.. who would keep them longer than that?"}
{"text":"I came here on a lovely summer evening with some friends when MoRoCo had just opened. We had just been out for sushi for dinner and were looking for some place to have dessert. We stumbled across MoRoCo and the fun and girly decor enticed us to give it a try.  It wasn't particularly busy as it was brand new, but there was a group there celebrating a wedding event of some sort (it might have been a pre-bachelor party or something). Our server was very chatty, attentive, and answered our questions. One of our party cannot have gluten, so he was very good about checking with the kitchen to see if there were any items that she could have and he addressed all of her concerns.  The menu describes the treats so well that I had a hard time deciding, but ultimately I chose these chocolate banana filled spring rolls that were served with various chocolate and caramel dipping sauces. These were decadent! I have noticed that these are no longer on the menu, but they were rather pricy (it might have been $16 or $18 for 3 small rolls. As such, I would not make MoRoCo a regular destination, but it is certainly fun for a treat or a special occasion!  Overall we had a good time and I particularly liked how the name of the restaurant represents the owner's \"three passions in life\" - which is what our waiter told us. From the website, \"Mo for Montana, Ro for Rory & Co for Cocoa. Montana and Rory are the children and inspiration, of the creator of MoRoCo Chocolat.\""}
{"text":"Just came back today (April 7, 2012) from a late brunch at MoRoCo.  It was HoRrIFiC. I can not, in good faith, recommend this place for food.  For a macaron - this place has hit it on the nose.  But, their food...holy smokes, it was awful.  I ordered the brunch fondue - came with pieces of sausage, dried out bits of french toast that tasted more like stale pieces of thick toast with no egg coating, tasteless bits of waffle, bananas that were not uniformly sliced (plus, one piece was bruised), and banged up strawberry bits.  Maple syrup and chocolate sauce were the best parts of the fondue.  My friends ordered eggs benny dishes and both of their eggs were over cooked and there was not enough hollandaise sauce.  $10 for a pot of tea.  $7 for a cafe latte.  All in all, a big over priced fail.  Never. Again."}
{"text":"So it was a late night and Summer's Ice Cream was closed so my friend and I decided to give this little sweets shop a shot since we've never been here before and they sell macarons and guess who loves macarons, THIS GIRL!  Super cute decor inside, and don't be fooled, it's not just a shop that sells delicious looking sweets, there's also a cafe seating area that's located just at the back! You can't see it from the outside, but when you walk in, you'll see it It was very clean and well kept for sure!  They have a very expensive selection of things but I can't complain, it is in Yorkville. My friend and I only got the macarons so I will just be reviewing those. There are so many flavours to choose from, but the one that really caught my eye was the red velvet macaron! So I ended up getting that and my friend stuck with the good ol' pistachio.  I'll be honest, the macaron was alright. Passable, I've definitely had better macarons before and with the price for these macarons that they sell, no thanks. The red velvet one was just missing something.  The pistachio was alright, flakey and hard.   Overall, I probably won't be back for the macarons but the other stuff look pretty good and since there's seating at the back, I'm super interested in what they have to offer!   They stay open pretty late, I think till about 1AM which is awesome if you're just around the area late at night and want to chill somewhere."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times and it's just not worth it.   Poor service, untimely manner that food is served, food is average, food choices are limited, and that 18.5% tip isn't deserved.   The only time I come here is for tea if it's late, one of the few tea places open late or if I go with friends who want to take cute photos out in the patio."}
{"text":"Had the high tea set here at Moroco Chocolat. Cute place and had a good time here but the food could be better!  We had the high tea set with macarons, scones and finger sandwiches assortments. I only liked one of the finger sandwiches..  The tea, on the other hand, was really good :)  We had fun picking which one we wanted - ended up picking the earl grey (safe choice!).  Service was excellent. Our waiter came back to check on us in good intervals."}
{"text":"Hot chocolate here is $8, which is expensive as fuck, but it is so damn good. Holy shit. I've only been here once, but the drink was so good I had to say something. I don't think I've had better hot chocolate in the city. It's in Yorkville. You can use your imagination to figure out what the venue and crowd are like. They also serve food, apparently. Forget that: just get two hot chocolates."}
{"text":"croque madam is amazing. chocolate fondu is spectacular. great for an intimate evening with friends, comfortable chairs and settes. Great experience."}
{"text":"A client suggested this place for lunch and I was pleasantly surprised. Lunch menu was pretty good. Truffle Mac & cheese, quiche...do it. White wine sangria was meh."}
{"text":"Oh Lord, where do I begin to describe this amazingly delicious but gloriously overpriced place?  I love everything about Moroco Chocolat; the location, the interior, the patio, the food and even the staff, surprisingly, are pretty fantastic. :)   I would totally recommend this place to anyone I personally like, but not to those I don't like because they should stay away from awesome places like these and stick to their sh*t places where the \"disliked\" truly belong (Sorry guys, just a personal preference).  Moroco Chocolat is a perfect place for indulging one's desire to eat really delicious sweet treats and have an amazing time doing so. :))"}
{"text":"I went for my birthday yesterday, and i had made a reservation online and asked for a balloon, when i got there, there was no balloon. I didnt mind, although when i got there they didnt really bother to check my reservation, since it was empty, they just sat us down. The ambience was really nice, very girly in my opinion, but very nice. I was upset because i made a reservation for 5, and when i got there i was hungry and ready to order, and the waitress told me the kitchen would only open at 5:30, they should have stated that when i made the reservation in the first place. We ordered a couple of drinks which although really pricey, tasted really good... I ordered the truffle mac & cheese and it was good, but lacked some salt and seasoning. I also had sipping chocolate which was the best part of my experience. I would come back again for a tea party maybe but not so much for the food and drinks. It was way too pricey for ok food, and im pretty sure its only pricey like that because of the location and the decor, and not so much for the quality of food. My waitress was actually very friendly and helpful. Overall it was a nice place to sot down and chat in a cute spot."}
{"text":"This place is way cool. You are paying (through the roof) for an insanely awesome setting and its worth it.  The food is really yummy and the macarons are fantastique.  I found the chocolates to be good, but nothing fabuulouusss. Truffle oil mac and cheese is SO YUMMY."}
{"text":"A group of us were looking for a nice desserts restaurant to celebrate a friend's birthday.  Upon arrival, we were intrigued by the whimsical purple-and-black decor.  The staff seemed quite friendly initially, and gave us a lot of time to make our selections.    When asked what were the most popular desserts, we were recommended to try the \"McQueen Cake\" and the \"Macwich\".  Both items were beautifully decorated, but flavour-wise, very bland.  \"A Black Tie Affair\" was a complete confusion of flavours for our tastebuds as the only adjective we could think of to describe it was SWEET.  Our other orders included a drink called\"Morocco Sipping Chocolate\" (supposedly milk and dark chocolate infused with various flavours), which was a cup of about 100mL of salty goo with hardly any chocolate taste that costed $12.  Our final attempt to salvage what little faith we had in this restaurant: we asked once again for recommendations for an easy request--we just wanted a delicious, chocolate-based drink, to which the \"Frozen Hot Chocolate\" was recommended.  The result?  A glass of watery-brown liquid with no chocolate taste.    When we relayed our feedback to the manager (who was eventually joined by the barista), we were received by some surprisingly rude attitudes given the nature of the restaurant.  Too bad for us, the 18% tips was already included in our final bill so we had no way of reflecting our dismay.  We must have been missing something that night, but this expensive chocolatier certainly disappointed us.  It was pretty to look at, but with below-average substance.  Beautiful packaging with air on the inside.  Definitely not one we would EVER consider revisiting."}
{"text":"Came here with my colleagues for Winterlicious lunch.  We had reservations for noon and we were the first ones there.    Upon arrival it looked like the restaurant was just opening?  Either way, we arrived at the restaurant and saw a bunch of hostess/servers just gabbing away around the bar area.  Have to dock one star off only cause they knew we where there but no one bothered to greet us or acknowledge that they would be sitting us down - we were  waiting for 5 mins.  Aside from that, it was a pretty good winterlicious lunch and we all loved our truffled mac and cheese, soup of the day, tuna tartare, desserts, etc.    Overall, great experience and aside from the beginning of our arrival, our server was very attentive and kept on checking on my group to make sure we were enjoying our food, etc.  For all those yelpers who mentioned that it was 18.5% gratuity, my group of 4 girls only had to pay 16% mandatory gratuity per person."}
{"text":"Indulgent, fun and rich (especially in price). We had the homemade s'mores. These decadent S'mores (at $22) are a very special treat. The marshmallows are homemade and have a very different texture. Much better than store-bought. The chocolate squares were great and melted perfectly. I loved the chocolate sauce on the side. Personally, i didn't like the homemade graham squares because they had too much cinnamon, which overpowered it. I think there was cinnamon in the salted caramel sauce, too. It comes with a little campfire at your table, which is cute, but, should probably have some rubbed stoppers on the bottom...   Warning! Slippery table + fire = danger! My date almost spilled the pot of flaming oil on my when he went to stab a marshmallow and the tray started spinning toward me.   On the website, the prices seemed far more reasonable, but I thought \"hey - it's a date, so why not?\" My date made me split the bill, which I wasn't too happy about given that it was his idea to go and our bill for one dessert and no drinks came to $30.  WATCH OUT - they add in the tip before the final price! It's very sneaky. Our waitress was also kind of rude because after we sat for a while chatting she came by and pointed at the table and said \"THAT's your bill.\" She tried to say \"oh some people don't realize it's the bill because it's on a plate\". Still, I thought it was pretty rude, myself.   Also the music was weird. It was club music (Top 40 and some rock. I thought jazz would have made the atmosphere a lot nicer).  If you go here, make sure your date intends to pick up the tab. Or be a wealthy Yorkviller.  I knew I shouldn't have left my Black Amex at my Malibu beach home."}
{"text":"Came here for Macaron Day only to be disappointed. I arrived an hour after they opened and the girl behind the counter said they were all out of macarons. How can that be? Did your place only allocate 10-20 complimentary macarons or something? Or are you not giving away any this year at all and just said it to promote your business? No one can check on that. Ridiculous. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"I've come here over the years whenever I want to treat myself or a friend. It's tucked away in a courtyard in Yorkville, with an outdoor patio, indoor seating area, and a shop (with a pretty tall chocolate fountain). The decor is very elaborate and creates a nice atmosphere. I've had the sipping chocolate, s'mores, and fondue, all of which were delicious! The shop has fondue to go, which was great as a little present for my friend."}
{"text":"FABULOUS.  My boyfriend and I rushed over to Moroco on Saturday night after having dinner. We got there at 11:30pm and we got there just in the nick of time. Our server actually asked the kitchen to reopen for us and for the couple that arrived just before us. Luckily, I knew what I wanted: The Three Brulées. A trio of Vanilla Bean, Dark Chocolate and Sweet Chili & Caramel Ginger was set before us in minutes, and it was gone in minutes, too.  The lounge interior is GORGEOUS. Plush, regal, sophisticated, trendy, candlelit... so very romantic... so very fun.  After our dessert, we perused the actual store. We got a quick overview of ALL the truffles and decided on a box of 6:  (1) GEISHA: White Couverture w/ White Chocolate & Green Tea,  (1) FLIRT: 40% Deep Milk Couverture w/ Tangy Raspberry Ganache (1) CARAMEL & ROASTED PECANS: 62% Dark Bittersweet Couverture w/ Soft Caramel & Roasted Pecans (1) MARQUIS DE NOIR: 66% Dark Couverture w/ Dark Ganache (2) [I can't remember the name]: Dark Couverture w/ Moet   I thought two champagne-infused pieces were fitting for the occasion. We got to try a few samples of a trial batch of truffles from St. Patrick's day (one that was guiness infused and one with mint). We also got to try a white chocolate truffle w/ olive oil in it. Smooooooth...  With so many different truffles, macarons, and pastries here, I will definitely be coming back! They're officially opening their patio this weekend. I'm looking forward to a Sunday Brunch in the near future."}
{"text":"I ate dinner here for a friend's birthday, and it was the worst dinner I've had in recent memory.   First off, despite the 18.5% mandatory gratuity, service wasn't particularly attentive once we ordered our food. If we wanted something like more water or extra napkins, it took an extra 5 to 10 minutes to get our waiter's attention. If I'm paying an extra 18.5% for service, I'm expecting top notch service.   Second, I ordered the zucchini spaghetti ($16), which infuriated me with the shockingly poor quality of the dish. Now, for something called the zucchini spaghetti, I was expecting zucchini and spaghetti. Reasonable, right? Apparently, zucchini spaghetti really means 'shaved zucchini'. The whole dish was literally just strings of zucchini with capers. On top of that, the portion size was absurdly tiny, even tinier than most appetizers I've had at high class restaurants. Now I understand that the Yorkville location means that your dollar is unlikely to stretch very far, but the portion size was truly ridiculous. And since it didn't even taste very good (very sour, no actual spaghetti), this felt like insult heaped on injury.   In short, MoRoCo is a tourist trap of a restaurant with anemic service and expensive, sub-par food."}
{"text":"I decided to update my review because I usually come here for Afternoon Tea and have never ordered off their menu.  I really think it's unfortunate that some people find the service pretentious because I find their servers very friendly and personable.  I ordered the Proseco and the Burger with Sweet Potato fries. If your looking for something to fill you up this would be the best option.   My friend ordered the Quesadillas and if was very light to say the least. She was still hungry while I was full from my meal.  I just love the ambience of this place and hope to come here for years to come. My daughters birthday is coming up and I can't wait to bring her here!"}
{"text":"This is admittedly an overpriced cafe for what it is, but it IS located in Yorkville, so it's almost expected; if you expect anything less, you're in the wrong neighbourhood.  That being said, I only come here once or twice a year with my friend as an indulgence for both of us. I almost always order the mac & cheese which, for me, is a good size & really tasty. I always end the visit with a macaron (or three) & sipping chocolate, both of which we really enjoy (highly recommend any of the season macarons, as well as the tried & true lavender cassis). They might not be the BEST macarons in the city, but they're certainly one of my favourites. Admittedly, the service here could use some improvement considering 1) the small size of the restaurant (which almost suggests a size in which good service could be expected) and 2) what you're paying."}
{"text":"Decadent, indulgent, chic and fun! Someone please get me a new pancreas.  Thoroughly recommended."}
{"text":"$35 for winterlicious dinner with an automatic 18.5% gratituty when it said 16% on the menu. which is ridiculous regardless! not even fine dining has such a charge!  i had the tuna tartare, salmon and cheesecake.   tuna tartare came with raw avacado chunks and extremely hard baguette! the tuna tartare itself was alright, nothing special.  the small piece of salmon came with a bed of quinoa that had no taste. the whole dish was bland.   cheesecake was extremely sweet. didnt finish it.  i tried my friend's truffled mac n cheese and that was also nothing special.  i dont recommend eating here. shouldve known though since it is a dessert place. but it was a complete rip off.  their french macarons are good, but i've had better. overall, really nothing special and overrated."}
{"text":"Cute storefront, restaurant at back. came mainly for macaroons. $2.75 price tag means it is more expensive than most other places. Salted caramel tastes like granulated sugar minus salted taste. The macaroons cracks easily too. Not a good choice for macaroons and since that's the only thing I got here, I can't rate anything else. They have a variety of chocolates in the store but everything's pretty pricey."}
{"text":"It's interesting to step outside of your comfort zone.  This is a passionately demasculinating place.  The second you walk in the door, you immediately start to feel your penis rusting as it prepares to fall off.     But that's not necessarily a bad thing.   Women absolutely love this spot.  You watch their eyes turn into jewels as they gaze as their surroundings.   The perfect combination of chocolate aroma, plush velvet and antiseptic personality.  The food is truly fantastic.  The staff are absolutely superb.   The cleanliness is obsessive compulsive.     If you were to vomit chocolate all over the floor, within seconds a minion of angels would sweep in unannounced to spotlessly clean it without leaving a trace.   It's almost as if they inhale garbage and exhale perfume.    I felt like I was on an entirely different planet."}
{"text":"My friend and I purchased a Groupon for their high tea experience. The Groupon alone was $78. Good thing we reserved ahead of time as they were fully booked when we arrived! Service at the beginning was average but became non-existent afterwards. I'm giving MoRoCo a lower star rating due to the poor service.  We were greeted originally and provided two boxes of tea to decide from. When we got the tea it took a long time for the treats tray to come out. We had already finished a cup of tea each and were waiting. Once we got the treats our server never came back to inquire how we were doing. At the end we had to repeatedly wave down the server just to get our bill. He totally forgot so we literally went to go look for him. Additionally, my friend asked him to pack up the scone and desserts. However, he packed the sandwiches and desserts instead. My friend wasn't impressed at the lack of attention from the server.  The only things we enjoyed was our tea and the scones. What a poor experience this weekend when we have to tip 18% to non-existent service."}
{"text":"Nice place to have afternoon tea with girlfriend but the music a little loudly and the stuff at friendly. Hanging out with friends Next time."}
{"text":"A pricey dessert place, it seems like you are paying more for the atmosphere and decor than the actual food. The room is gorgeous, decked out in deep purple and black with chandeliers and luxurious details. Went with some girlfriends on a Saturday night and the place was packed with a young, fashionable crowd. What we didn't appreciate was the cold/snobby service we received. Kind of ruined the whole experience. We had the milk chocolate fondue, which was tasty but nothing out of the ordinary, and a bottle of the house wine. Our waitress kept pressuring us to order more.  They do have a shop in the front where you can buy chocolates to go. Everything is beautifully presented and would be fantastic for gift-giving. Maybe I'll come back and try their macarons, but the bad service was a real turn-off."}
{"text":"This is a little to-go cafe and restaurant combo, with a patio. There's a bar in the back too that serves pretty awesome sounding cocktails (very desserty with lots of Bailey's and macaron garnishes) but holy cow at 14-15$ a drink, no one's getting fat or wasted.   I think this place is absolutely worth a try - it's got a very adorable, Alice in Wonderland look to it, and it's very well decorated. The patio has a cute vibe almost reminiscent of the spinning teapot ride at Disneyland.  The to-go cafe is really good, filled with brightly pastel colored treads that call your name. My major gripe is that it didn't seem quite... clean. I was gawking at the macaron display when i realized that a few of them had a few fruit fly buddies - I'm not sure if this is something that people just put up with in Toronto, but I definitely got pretty turned off by it. I pointed it out to the staff and she just laughed nervously and waved them away. For 2.85 a macaron I would have liked them to be fly-free. Macarons were a little larger than usual.   The to-go cafe staff was very nice, but I found the full service staff a little snobby. We were told by the to-go staff that we could eat our purchases in the patio, but after we headed over to the patio the full service staff were a little rude about not letting us through.   Got the fondue to go, which was pretty good. The chocolate wasn't the kind that hardened to a shell though."}
{"text":"I went here with my boyfriend on a cool, rainy night and it was just what we needed!! We came after dinner and ordered a pot of coco cream ribosome tea first. There was coconut infused and so so good. The tea pot is big for two people, not that would have stopped me from ordering. We had about 2-3 cups each and the pot was still half full. The presentation was really cute and it complimented the delicious salted caramel macaroon. The macaroon and the tea was a perfect balance and I've had macaroons from LaDuree too. The salted caramel is one of the top (if not the top).   Next we ordered the Melteaser. It's the dessert where you pour melted hot dark chocolate over a chocolate ball, thus exposing ice cream and raspberries hidden inside. My server asked the kitchen to put vanilla ice cream instead of chocolate to better suit my preference. The chocolate syrup has a nutty flavour to it which I enjoyed. The portion of this dessert is small for it's price. I just ate dinner so this was the perfect amount. It's essentially one big scoop of ice cream. I'd like to think it's quality over quantity.   I can't wait to come back and try their afternoon tea and savoury menu. Our server was really polite and accommodating."}
{"text":"I came here twice. The first time I came here, I got several macarons. This is certainly not the cheapest place for macarons but you do get what you pay for - which is delicious macarons! I don't think the macarons here were chilled like Nadège Patisserie (not that it tastes better chilled or not chilled). I wouldn't go so far as to say this is the place for the best macarons but you won't be disappointed.  The second time I came here, I got a chocolate and vanilla twist yogurt ice cream and my friend got half a dozen macarons. The yogurt ice cream was disgusting! It was gritty and the taste was just off. It was a waste of $4 which could've gotten me approximately 1.5 macarons! Also, the box that stored the half a dozen macarons was poorly designed. Halfway through shopping, my friend went to check up on her macarons and they were all smashed. They should've designed a more compact box so the macarons couldn't move around."}
{"text":"I have tried the macarons here but finally had the pleasure of trying the desserts in the lounge just a few days ago We came just for dessert because the savory dishes seem somewhat overpriced for what they are ($17 for a turkey sandwich??? I think not)  Anyway, we wanted tea and the server informed us that 1 teapot is really only good for 1-2 cups of tea. Well its $10 for a pot of tea and this includes 1 macaron. $10 for 1-2 cups of tea (and small cups at that) is PRETTY expensive (unless the tea is laced with diamonds, which i was not informed of) However, the presentation is quite nice. You are first served a nice teacup with a special metal strainer to pour your tea through and they have a very nice selection of teas. The server actually had a tray with all the teas so we could see them and smell them beforehand.   We shared the Penance for Pleasure Platter. This includes 2 banana/chocolate/peanut butter spring rolls which come with caramel sauce and raspberry sauce to dip, 2 raspberry chocolate brownies sitting atop whipped cream and raspberries, 2 dessert \"hamburgers\", 4 \"fries\", and 2 of the Kiss me Kake  The spring rolls were very tasty; warm and full of flavour even without the sauces; the sauces were GREAT too (the caramel had something a bit different in it, it was more creamy than just sticky)  The Kiss me Kake was also VERY good; it is very rich and moist and the cream cheese frosting is wonderful  The brownies were very moist and not at all dry and flourly like at some places. However, they have pieces of raspberry in there, which some do not like  The burgers were my least favourite. The \"bun\" was dry and mealy. I actually took the \"top bun\" off because it didn't have much flavour. The \"burger\" also kind of breaks apart and is hard to eat all together. The fries are just shortbread cookies. I suggest dipping into one of the sauces for more flavour.  The platter was definitely enough for 2 people to share. Perhaps even a third could have shared because we had 1 Kiss me Kake and 1 brownie left over.   The platter is definitely worth the price but the tea is QUITE over priced  Overall, an enjoyable experience.  The macarons here are also VERY tasty and moist and chewy!"}
{"text":"Pretty good macarons not the best Nadege is much better but MoRoCo is definitely the best bang for the buck, larger then the average macaron and I'm a fan of the lavender macaron. This place is really nice and has a great atmosphere everything they sell I'm the store seems like they but a lot of effort into everything they make including the chocolate. It has a cafe section and lounge which also looks super cute."}
{"text":"Milk Chocolate Hot Chocolate never costs soooooo MUCH! But never tastes sooooo GOOD! I found this place by walking the streets of Yorkville and was drawn in by the cuteness of the exterior ( Over sized White leather sofa chairs ) while the inside has this dark indulgent Black decor. Yorkville kind of reminds me of Newbury Street in Boston, so I did not mind the extra bucks I paid for the Hot Chocolate since it was so yummy and got some quality Chocolate flavor.  I hear they also do brunch, so that will be another time ;-)"}
{"text":"This place is allll about the atmosphere. I've been here many times. It's pricy and some of the food ideas are really unique, but to be honest the taste isn't out of this world or anything. Still, I'm not about to stop going here because you feel like you're stepping into Alice in Wonderland or something! The rich purple interior is the stuff of dreams, and the trendy white patio is something to see.  Great place for a date or a girls night out!"}
{"text":"I had brunch today here with seven friends.  It's a nice restaurant and was fairly busy.  Even the bathrooms are nice. There are three individual ones for women and two for men.  I ordered the Banana Pancakes ... and they were probably the best pancakes I've ever had. Very light and sweet. The banana was carmelized and the whipped cream was fresh. Yum!  Yes, it's a bit pricey and and the service isn't all that quick but it gave us a chance to catch up.  And yes, they add 18.5% tip to the bill automatically.  As you enter and leave the restaurant, you have to go through their chocolate store.  Everything looks delicious and I was able to resist!"}
{"text":"I was daydreaming about the goat cheese souffle for weeks, only to learn that the head chef had changed! No more souffle!  Also, the music was really loud on the patio-- pop music. Seriously, I don't go to Y-ville to hear Avril Lavigne (sorry peeps).   Still, 4 stars redeem MoRoCo because the drinks were A-MAZING-- there was a green tea cardamon cocktail served with a truffle that was worth every dollar. And the decor is totally lush."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped by for the first time recently since I really wanted to eat some macaroons. As soon as you walk in, the glorious 12 selections of daily macarons are right there, luring you in. I couldn't help it, I had to try them! After much deliberation (and I do mean MUCH), we decided on these six flavors:   Red Velvet - a classic. So delicious. Perfect amount of creaminess as the filling inside. Tiramisu - Absolutely wonderful. Typically I don't enjoy tiramisu as cake but as a macaroon, this was really surprisingly very, very good.  Salted Caramel - Another tasty selection. It's hard to hit the salted caramel flavor, but MoRoCo did it well.  Pralines & Cream - Another macaroon I would eat again. This one had such a great nutty flavor to it. Lemon - The filling for the lemon was pretty sour. It wasn't a cream filling like the above four but rather a jelly-like filling. Let's just say this is the macaroon for the adventurous. Lavender - Also one with a jelly filling. It was a very unexpected taste - a bit sour but the lavender was there.   I think MoRoCo does the cream fillings better than their jelly fillings and the lemon and lavender would absolutely benefit if they changed it to a cream filling instead. It would probably offset the sourness of the macaroon.   My one gripe was that the macaroons weren't sturdy enough. I put the bag into my purse and when I took it out a bit later, most of them had slid apart!!"}
{"text":"We came here for fancy desserts :p  The decor is cute, the atmosphere is warming and romantic. The staffs are very friendly and quick. One of the staffs was very useful when my friend had questions about all the choices of teas they have.  I ordered cappuccino with Savoury Crepes (Chicken & mushrooms in a rosemary white wine sauce). The chicken was pretty good, but the sauce was too creamy. I started to feel sick after finishing half of the dish.   Cappuccino came with a cute little piece of chocolate. It was super foamy and tasted pretty good.   We shared the chocolate fondue and 2 desserts : S'mores Love and Get Cherried Away. They looked very attractive and tasted fine. Too sweet for me though. The macaroons here aren't very good, compare to other shops.  The place is a bit hard to find, and it was pricey. You can easily find the same quality meals like MoRoCo at any restaurants with more reasonable price. At MoRoCo, you pay for the fancy atmosphere, and high-quality service experience."}
{"text":"SHIT AS SHIT.  Everything is bland. And nasty. Come for the macaroons and leave immediately. Do not, do not, do not eat the food.   The chicken crepe is like a lot like of food you would get from a three star Cuban all inclusive resort.   The Mac and cheese has no cheese and only butter not a sight of truffle. For 15 dollars I can get 7 boxes of Mac and cheese."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of toggled writing but the food here more than makes up for that. Moroco was a belated birthday present from the bestie, as my annual birthday tradition is afternoon tea.  We are seeking to become afternoon tea experts in the city!   VIBE  As the others have said, it's definitely a luxurious chocolate filled boudoir. If you want to feel like a princess and eat your face off, this is your place. I love the plush velvet couches in royal purple; the celebrity hand prints that grace the walls with their pictures (SO Yorkville) and the chairs also in purple velvet which are still as comfortable as the couch.   Service is spot on but a 17% gratuity built in the check for a table less than six is not cool. And then asking for a tip if you're paying credit on top of it? A bit low classy.   Otherwise, clientele is a bit predictable and a bit of a surprise if that makes sense.  You've got the panda express (sorry to say!), the silver haired ladies who lunch and beside us a bunch of guys who I'm pretty sure weren't gay but seemed very Rosedale (\"Yeah, I lived in Brazil for a bit...\")    WE ATE  We went all out with the high tea. You get a choice of tea, sipping chocolate or champagne. We opted for sipping chocolate (milk). My best friend described it as her \"crack.\" Amazing!   The difference between the afternoon tea and high tea is the choice of an entree. We were starved so we got the entree. I got: Truffled Mac N Cheese.  Oh Em Gee! Amaaazing. Literally, that's what I told our waiter! With the other delectables, it was more than filling. I gobbled it up right away. The perfect comfort food on a slushy Saturday after some shopping.   Bestie had the quiche. She said it was just egg. I'd try the croque monsieur next time. But what's cool is that you can come here for lunch and try entrees or fondue or the sipping chocolate on its own...  On our tasty tray, my favourite things were: the scones and devonshire cream. Wow! They also have a lemon preserve which is different from the other more traditional places we've tried.  Those chocolate versions of whoopee pies and mini chocolates.  The salmon sandwiches. Longer and more filing than other places we've tried.    OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK Out of the three high teas, we've been to (Windsor Arms, Anonna) Moroco is my favourite. Perfect for a weekend afternoon with your nearest and dearest.  Just try on clothes BEFORE you go here!"}
{"text":"Delicious Eclairs.  Hot chocolate had a different flavor - a bit bitter.  Chocolate surprises with your orders.  Very cool ambiance."}
{"text":"A perfect gem of indulgence. From sublime sips to decadent chocolate dips MoRoCo is a wonderful refuge from the rush of the city. Service here is amazing, attentive and friendly without being overbearing. The menu is creative and fun - perfect for sharing and enjoying over a long gossipy chat."}
{"text":"Lets face it, cupcakes 15 minutes of fame is fast approaching.  We truly need a new bite size dessert to triumph, and that my friends is the macaron.  I have been going to west coast cities like San Fran, Los Angeles and many others and they have been serving macarons for the past few years.  Thankfully  now  more local places that are starting to make them.  For people who think cupcakes are pricey, you might want to skip macarons altogther because they are basically the same price and resemble the size of a 2 bite brownie I have been loyal to Nadege however i have recently switched to Team MoRoCo.  I came here the other day and sampled the pistachio and the salted caramel.  The caramel was excellent, it had that robust flavour without tasting burnt.  Plus it had the crisp shell, but remained chewy on the inside.  The pistachio had a great flavour.  Some flavours of macarons you sample may be olive oil or rose, and they are very subtle, but you could truly taste the flavours here.  The reason i docked MoRoCo one star was because the filling in the pistachio was a very unpleasant shade of green.  Also the filling needs to be tighter because the shells slipped off almost instantly after being bagged, which btw they should really use boxes for the price.  Overall great shop, i cannot wait to go back in the summer and use their patio."}
{"text":"Had the most wonderful, idyllic, brunch here at MoRoCo and I am so sad that I don't live in Toronto, or, surely, I would be back every week!  After wandering down the absolutely charming Yorkville Avenue, we found MoRoCo tucked back off the street, in a quiet courtyard.  Greeted by friendly and helpful staff, we were seated out on the patio, which was perfect for enjoying the nice afternoon and people watching.  I honestly cannot explain just how quaint and charming this place was; I literally felt like I was in a dream, soaking up the sun, chatting with friendly people, eating brunch on a Sunday afternoon.  We couldn't even begin to decide what we wanted to order, so we asked our waitress...who promptly took our menus away from us, jokingly (so we wouldn't confuse ourselves any more than we already had, looking at all of the options), and helped us make our final choices.    When our food arrived it was presented perfectly and it tasted WONDERFUL!  The staff was attentive, followed up to see how everything was, and refilled our water multiple times.  It was an absolutely perfect experience.  I would say MoRoCo is an absolute MUST VISIT in Toronto.  If/when I am back in town I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"My first impression of MoRoCo Chocolat was made over the phone. The host who had taken my reservation (which included my full credit card information) was in the midst of saying \"bye\" when I had to politely cut her off and ask whether we should set a time. Her answer, which was \"if you'd like to\", struck me as odd, but when I later missed a call from her and got a voice mail detailing the other things that she had forgotten to mention, I began thinking that she was probably not a ditz, but just inexperienced.  Although it was really nice to find the table already set up with tea things when we arrived, we were (very) slightly disappointed that sitting outside on the patio was not offered as an option (as the two of us had agreed upon while patiently waiting for the host to finish her phone conversation). Perhaps this is something they could have surveyed for a preference during the reservation. No big deal.  Our highly anticipated high tea started with a difficult decision which I had already anticipated upon scanning the menu online. At $55 per head, how could you ask us to choose between sipping chocolate and tea? Luckily, our extremely friendly server, (who was recognized by my birthday guest of honour as ex-Mengrai Thai), had the good sense to suggest that we order one of each and share. Great idea! In fact, I feel that it would have been a lot nicer if that was just standard. In any case, we were extremely pleased with our choices of rich milk chocolate with chai sipping chocolate and fragrant rooibois prickly pair tea with honey on the side.  The standard high tea assortment of sandwiches and scones were good, but filled us up so much so that we could hardly start on the top tier of desserts. The lovely box that we got everything packed to take home in was as much a gem to look at as it was to hold and walk around with. During a late macaroon session the same night, the delicate sweets proved to still be quite nice.  All in all, everything was good save for a couple complaints. I probably wouldn't have had a problem with the initially slow service of the food if I hadn't been so hungry. To be fair, that issue more than fixed itself in the end and high tea is after all a rather leisurely pursuit. However, I just felt that there could have been a shorter wait between the tea and food service seeing as that they knew we would be arriving at that specific time. I also didn't appreciate that an 18.5% gratuity was automatically added to the bill."}
{"text":"DO NOT BUY THE MILK HOT CHOCOLATE  we paid more than $10 for a horribly mediocre, and far too sweet, milk chocolate hot chocolate. i wish the server had winked at me or rolled her eyes to indicate this purchasing decision was ridiculous.   i don't know about good hot chocolate in toronto, but i paid about the same amount for perfect hot chocolate (multiple samples) at burdick's in nyc. go there.  BEWARE!"}
{"text":"Alright, so every veritable girly-girl who claims the movie Marie Antoinette or French Bulldogs as they're fave things will go ape-shit bananas over this place and rightfully so. How can you not love a place with a chocolate fountain and velvet curtains?   Came here to meet my girly girlfriend for a midday nosh and shopping shenanigans in Yorkville.  The interior is kitted out like a Baroque Era  wet-dream, part salon style dining room and part retail boutique.   The clientele is of course mostly of the female persuasion, lots of mother-daughters, girlfriends catching-up for fancy gossip sessions, and some wannabe socialite types.  Our server was a super fab and buff Brazilian fella who had the nicest demeanor, not to mention a smile that could melt frozen chocolate.  He left us our menus and I have to say MoRoCo offers a very impressive collection of Champagnes, but this ain't the place to get crunk.  It's a place to get your pretty pomp and circumstance on.  But it's hard to put etiquette to practice and not have the urge to chomp down like a Neanderthal as the food really is terrific!   Girly friend ordered the Prociutto Romaine salad and I got the Quiche Du Jour, but admittedly this was just to whet our palates for the marvelous desserts to come.  *Dessert-o-gasm Alert* Be prepared to let it loose as the desserts will have you MMMing and AHHHing  aloud in sensual abandon. The table of poseur socialites with fake LV bags kept shooting me dirty looks, I shot a look back that read \"FU\"  and continued LOUDER on my audible/edible journey of MoRoCo's delights. For reference I ordered the Whoopie Pie which is Intense Dark Chocolate Cake with Chocolate Cream Cognac Cherry Truffle and Girly Girl ordered the Banana Split Eclair with Crisp Buttery Éclair, salted Caramel Custard, Caramelized Banana,Chocolate Frozen Yogurt & Nut Brittle. We were having a feverish frenzy of feeding and lots of forking around tasting each others desserts. Yeah my girlfriend and I were pretty much having a  Four-Way with our desserts.  ** Bathroom Props* * ...I've never flushed with more \"j'n sais quoi\" than at this fancy head. Being in this bathroom makes me feel like a French Burlesque performer named Chi Chi Le Pew wanting to engage in  a private dance with well...the toilet!  Seriously decadent decor all gilded, and marbled and damask wallpapered, if it were any more lavish the TP would be made of satin!  Yes, admittedly the pricing is steep but the taste and quality of food is fantasic, service pleasant and getting to luxuriate in the opulent surroundings alone...well you clearly do get what you pay for here.  If you can't spare the airfare for France and crave a sweet indulgent Salon style dining experience, complete with release,  your inner Franco-phile will beam with afterglow for MoRoCo Chocolat!"}
{"text":"I picked up a few treats for myself from MoRoCo on a recent visit with a friend who was grabbing some gifts for her boss.  Macarons looked tempting so I got the coconut one ($2.55) and a chocolate pecan bar ($9.99).  The chocolate bar was definitely overpriced (Do you know how many Lindt bars I can buy for $10?) and the taste of the chocolate was just average.    Not to mention that when I was eating my stupidly expensive bar, I came across a huge nasty piece of plastic bag embedded in the chocolate.  I hope that was not a golden ticket to nowhere.    I probably wouldn't seek out MoRoCo for future purchases.  I've got lowbrow chocolate tastes...give me a Crunchie bar anyday."}
{"text":"Very fab place for tea or bevvies with the ladies. But I can't see men liking this place too much.  We tried the lunch menu. Food was great. I probably wouldn't come back unless someone else was paying, as it's certainly not cheap. I had the steak sandwich and it was served with nice thick slices of medium rare roast beef. Delicious.   The decor is superb! Sort of \"Alice in Wonderland\" meets \"the Ritz\". Although, High Tea at this place is $55 ! Which I believe is nearly as costly as tea at the real deal (Ritz in London).  Service was great though. I only sampled a small truffle (came with my coffee) but perhaps I will be back to sample more treats."}
{"text":"3 and 1/2, coukd be 4. hot chocolate and melteater chocolate dessert are pretty good!! however, you will not eat/drink there on a regular basis because it is 1° heavy and concentrated chocolate (good point, but caloric), 2° quite expensive and 3° accessorily, a little bit noisy (not a good place for an intimate dating...what a pitty, based on the effect chocolate can have on people, right?) and cold (air conditionning is too strong). Macarons have good texture and just as needed, but flavours are not all discernable (passion fruit tastes barely like apricot)."}
{"text":"At first, the staff was impolite, but after 20 minutes or so they were very friendly. The food is incredible - high quality chocolate and coffee. Overall, the place is good, but they should improve the quality of the service."}
{"text":"A \"gaudy\" but delicate ambiance, great for a girls morning or night out . Brunch is served and service was wonderful!  Love the decor when you feel \"girly\" and a decent patio in Yorkville away from the cars and crowd.  Truffle Mac and Cheese is worth the trip!"}
{"text":"I came here with my sister for Summerlicious 2014 dinner today. We were quite disappointed with our first experience here for several reasons. When we made our reservation at this restaurant we had viewed the online menu prior to doing so. But to our surprise, when we got to Moroco the Summerlicious menu offered to us was completely different from what they had online. When we asked our server if they changed it she said yes because they had changed their chef , and this was after they submitted their old menu online.Their new menu mains includes quiche, mac and cheese, and sliders... I mean, for $35 we were expecting a little more than that. The best part of the meal was dessert, and that is probably the only good thing i have to say about this place. The service as well was slow, and I barely saw my server. When we got the bill we also noticed that it was auto-grat 18.5%!!! The food and service wasnt great. If i ever decide to come back here i would have to say it'll only be to try their desserts.   Don't waste your time and money if you plan on going to Moroco for Summerlicious. It was a disappointment."}
{"text":"The macarons here were okay, not amazing Laduree quality or anything but decent for what you can find in Toronto.   This isn't really somewhere I would choose to go for high tea, from the ambience and the decor, you can tell that they tried but it almost feels like they try too hard. The food is average, the sweets are okay, and the tea is good. They have a wide variety of tea and I've tried a couple of them and they were all quite nice so I'll give them that. Service was pretty good when I was there, the waitress was really pleasant and helpful. The desserts were really good, I would come again just for the dessert.   Overall, I would recommend you stick with the Fairmont for high tea but this might be a fun place to check out if you're looking for something different."}
{"text":"The macarons here are not the best I've had in the city, but they offer much more than just macarons. They have great hot chocolates, cakes, savoury foods and an excellent selection of tea. If you're feeling fancy, there's also chocolate Fondue sets and you can roast marshmallows at the table! The atmosphere is luxurious, comfortable and cozy. Their tea sets are super elegant and pretty! It's a great place to go to with girlfriends, bring your mom, or even as a date! It's always fun to get some Goodies to go too from the front shop."}
{"text":"When the bill came I only glanced at the total and paid with my card and added tip on top. Only when I got home and looked at the bill did I realize that 18.5% gratuity was already added and I had paid an extra 15% on top. The waitress had saw me enter the extra tip amount and had not informed me that their restaurant automatically charges 18.5%. Furthermore, we were only a party of two and all we ordered was a fruit bowl, s'mores and tea to share. I'm very disappointed in this."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner on Friday night with a friend. The service and food was amazing! The interior is beautiful with a warm and romantic atmosphere. It's definitely a great place for a date.   My friend ordered the Truffled Mac and Cheese and I had the Chicken Tempura. We both enjoyed our dishes! We then ordered the same dessert, Toffeegasm, thinking that the serving was going to be small. Boy were we wrong!   I'll definitely be back again to try brunch and afternoon tea!"}
{"text":"Moroco chocolat is not the best place to get your macaron fix. The customers and staff are pretentious. The prices are absurd, service is snobby and rude and food is just so-so. The fondue was nothing to rave about either, the chocolate does not stand out and neither does any of the cheap fruit/pretzels/macaron shells that come with it. I've also tried their frozen yogurt, which was awful- it was so watery. For the prices being charged, the quality and service does not deliver. The only redeeming quality of Moroco is that their chocolates make decent gifts when I'm not in the mood to go out of my way to buy a thoughtful gift for someone."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend today for afternoon treats. I ordered an Americano and the 'A Black Tie Affair' cake.   The service was really good. Our server was very courteous even though my friend and I took forever to decide what we wanted. He was apologetic when our cake was delayed and offered us both a macaron and a truffle for the inconvenience.   The champagne truffles we had were good. The macarons were quite nutty and fresh. The cake was plain and nothing to write home about.   Overall the atmosphere was nice and the service was great. I will probably come back to try more of their desserts."}
{"text":"I usually like fuzzy and cute thing... but I don't like MoRoCo Chocolat experience at all....   Just looking at the menu annoyed me.... aside from everything just insanely overpriced, all these wording of additional charges if more than the stated people sharing/time you allow to occupy a table...The tacky white furniture on the patio, the loud music from the stereo system, slow services..... all these annoyed me more...   Maybe I was just having a bad day??   3 of us sharing:   Les Bijoux Sucrés ($28) A combination of Spring Rolls, Kiss Me Kake, Brownie and MoRoCo \"Burger and Fries\"   A Pot of Tea ($10) with a Maracon   Everything were good... but not Excellent.. and not too memorable aside from my companions...   I really cannot justify myself in spending $55+tax+tips for an afternoon tea here at MoRoCo... but I did spend 40GBP for an Afternoon Tea experience at the Ritz in London and didn't regret that!   Maybe I be back for their $7 Cappuccino with a choice of Maracon on a lazy afternoon.... but definitely not going to order those other overpriced items on the menu!"}
{"text":"I've been to MoRoCo a few times in the past for their macarons, and also sat in and had some chocolate fondue once. I remember I used to like their macarons in the past (perhaps when I was more of a macaron noob), but most recently came here for Macaron Day T.O. and I have to say I wasn't that impressed. Selection-wise they didn't have they many flavours, maybe... 12? Plus most of them were your pretty standard chocolate, vanilla, hazelnut, salted caramel, cassis, oreo, pistachio, etc. The macarons here are also more expensive than at other places ($2.55/each), although to be fair they are a bit larger in size. The texture also wasn't quite what I wanted, if anything they were kind of... too chewy?   I heard they have brunch and afternoon tea, so I wouldn't mind coming back to give those a try, but personally I think you'd be better off going to other places for your macarons which offer more selection and better quality at cheaper prices."}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday dinner and it was TERRIBLE! May I list out the many reasons...  1. Service was terrible. My friend called in a couple days earlier to make resos, and they said they had a full house that night and could only accommodate 9 people (we wanted 10). Thankfully one of our friends couldn't make it. But the whole night we were there, about 80% of the restaurant was empty, not to mention our table seats 10 naturally!!!!  2. Wait times. After ordering our food, we waited 20 minutes only for the waitress to tell us \"your food will take a while, are you guys ok with that?\" As if we have a choice??? She adds \"I hope you guys are not super hungry.\" LOL we ask for bread and she says it's not complimentary. 'Nuff said.  3. Food was mediocre at best. Really can't add more to this...I had the Beef Burger and have definitely had better from fast food joints.  4. We brought an outside cake to cut, and they refused to let us. Ok fine, since you guys are a dessert place, we were not too peeved. We ask them to help us fridge the (ice cream) cake until we were ready to leave. As we left and retrieved the cake, it was almost completely MELTED. What kind of dessert place doesn't know how to properly store a cake???! Fail of epic proportions. And you guys owe my friend a real cake!!!  Needless to say will never be coming back under any circumstances."}
{"text":"I tried macarons for the very first time last year at this cafe and was glad I chose this place as my first.  The selection of macarons was very good with plenty of flavors to choose from. From this visit alone, I already established some personal favorites. I went with another friend and because we were both \"macaron virgins\". The hostess suggested that we grabbed a cappuccino that came with a macaron. We both enjoyed our picks and as we walked out, we grabbed some more for the road.   Prices are fair for the area it's in and these macarons were by far the biggest I've had. A lot of places I went to afterwards were bite sized which was disappointing.  Of course being in Yorkville, it's such a classy place to just enjoy afternoon tea and relax. Will definitely come back if I am in the area."}
{"text":"My friends and I came into Moroco seaking warmth from the February cold and try their famous hot chocolate. I tried the milk hot chocolate, it was good but I had better and personally for the price of it I was a little disappointed. I also had the funfetti cake ( red velvet cake with macaroon) not bad, but it felt a little too sweet. One of my friends ordered the cocoa pancakes from the brunch menu and that was really good. If I were to come back I would definitely order that.  The decor of Moroco was chic and I can definitely see people coming here for special events. Neverthless, in the future I'll most likely go somewhere else to satisfy my chocolate cravings."}
{"text":"Organized a baby shower for a coworker and choose this place because its close to work.  We were seated in the back with a bridal shower I guess we were both loud and they wanted to keep us out of the way of other diners. Service was pretty good and the food was very good and fresh.  Too full for dessert which was a shame.  Would give it five stars but I found the prices pretty outrageous.  $20 for a salad!?!"}
{"text":"I came for the macaroons. They are expensive and worth every bite (the chocolate orange one is worth its weight in macaroons) and typically run out quickly. I am not sure how, as the location is a bit tricky, but regardless, whenever I go there are normally not that many left.  One time I bothered to get the fondue-to-go but I didn't get far because there were no lids for the chocolate, making it hard to transport beyond the door, and it was too tempting to not eat immediately. Messy, too.  The most indulgent part of the whole place is the decor - it's beautiful!"}
{"text":"Yorkville - check. Over priced - check.  Sexy - check.  Delicious - check.  Worth it - check .   There you have it folks, 5 checks. This means we're good to go. I've been here a few times and each time I haven't been disappointed.   When you walk into this place you're greeted by all types of chocolate and sweet treats. As you make your way inside you see the plush fabrics, low lighting and just a really sexy type of feeling going on. They have an outdoor patio which is lovely but indoors is just as great. Men I would suggest you bring your date here cause they'll love it.   If I'm going to suggest one this to try it's their soft serve ice cream (or frozen yogurt- but i'm pretty sure it's ice cream). I'll be honest, it's rich and creamy and delightful. Such a nice treat on a hot day. I'd go here over Summer's (next door and down the stairs) any day.   This spot is also great for a girls night fi you want to have cocktails before you really get the night going. My drink of choice is \"A Hot Mess,\" you'll have to try it when you go.   I really can't say too much more about this place, you really just need to go and experience it especially if you're a chocolate lover."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd Winterlicious 2015 dinner.  Before I get onto the food, I want to discuss my unpleasant experience before dinner even started. We were on our way there and I get a phone call from two other friends who were early that MoRoCo did not have reservations under my name. For the record, I called ahead earlier in the week because I was unable to make reservations on their Bookenda app on their website. (As an aside, I'm very disappointed they switched over to Bookenda from OpenTable because I'm a few hundred points from getting a certificate) I had spoken to the hostess that day who said that while they cannot accommodate my 7PM request for a table of 8 people for Friday, February 6, she would be able to accommodate 7:30PM. She confirmed and took down my information but I guess she never wrote it down. Or lost it. I don't really care because at the end of the day, 8 people didn't have a table for 7:30PM.  Prior to that unpleasant experience, I had in fact, called in earlier that afternoon to speak to a supervisor about a certain request but was put on hold for 20 minutes. I called in again after I hung up with my friend and asked about our 7:30 reservation. I apologize as I may have taken a tone with the hostess. I knew she had her hands tied in trying to accommodate for my group. However, I felt that the entire time she spoke to me, she wanted to make sure that I knew she wasn't the one culpable for losing my reservation to the point that she asked the time and date that I had phoned in to place blame on someone else. But, I guess she was just covering her ass. The best she could do was push our reservation time. Eventually, I relented and said we would take a 9PM reservation. We came all the way here for dinner, and everywhere else was booked on a Friday night.  I went in to speak to her that a friend of mine has work after dinner and if there was any way they could pre-order her food in the kitchen. She has given us the paper menu for Winterlicious and said we were free to keep it. Things were looking up.  Upon our return for the 9PM reservation, we had taken the liberty of grabbing the same paper menus that were free for us to keep and read it. The hostess returned and yanked it out of my friend's hand and said that the menus were already on our table. I think that's a little confusing because she was telling us to keep it earlier. And from what I could tell, we were her last table before it was time for her to leave so she was free to look cross, and treat us as if we had inconvenienced her evening. We were placed in the back with two tables put together. Two oblong tables that were meant for 2 people... for 8.  That aside, the experience after that was OK. Although the fact that we had to wait and the hostess' attitude did sour the mood.  A few of the group had the pumpkin soup. This is the soup that first arrived at the table for my friend with the rush request. Notice that there is no bread when the rest of the pumpkin soups came with rock solid french bread afterwards.  I got the Tuna Tartare. The bread on the left is the same one missing from the soup above. The tartare was good. It wasn't the best I've had. Like previous comments - the bread was rock solid.  For your main, there were three choices. The Artisan Burger, which everyone loved. The sweet potato fries went really well with the chipotle mayo sauce. It was like having all dressed chips! I personally did not try the burger myself but from what I heard, it was delicious.  I've been to MoRoCo before for the High Tea and the Truffle Macaroni and Cheese was part of it. It was exactly as I remembered. Delicious. The bf said you couldn't taste the cheese but I would have to disagree.  No one ordered the salmon.  Finally for dessert, I had the Adam & Eve which is an apple galette. This is not a galette. It's apple pie filling in a tart shell with whipped cream. It was OK.  This is the one dessert I didn't try. This is the Funfetti cake which is a red velvet cake with a macaron. They are known for their macarons so you can't go wrong with that. It was the one with the best reviews among the table.  Finally, the get cherried away. I didn't order this as 1) I don't like cherries 2) I am kinda over cheesecake. But I have to say, it was pretty good. It was rich but not overly rich.  Would I recommend MoRoCo? Yes, with a caveat.  Either make your reservation online or call and double check. That's just ridiculous. I still think they are pretty good in terms of afternoon tea/high tea offerings. The servers are troopers while the hostesses (not just the one mentioned above) could use some attitude check."}
{"text":"This is an evening dining experience review.  I went there hungry for a brunch item (french toast covered in cheese and bacon stuck to the toast with cheese as the glue).  Once they told me that a great dining alternative would be Mac and Cheese - I said sure, sign me up.  Well after only ordering the Mac and cheese and one drink, and $40 later for only me! (read: super expensive resto) I was slightly disappointed.  While the Mac and Cheese was good... I'm a man. A man who eats, like a real man. Perhaps this place was just trying to teach me portion control, I thought. Especially since they seem to be telling me what's all right in life.  Waiter: Will anyone be joining you tonight? Me: Nope, just me. Waiter: weep, that a okay.  Perhaps I'm reading into it too much, he was a fairly nice guy, really.  Back on track with my above thought on eating like a man... I'd say, if you are not hungry, then this is a great place to dine. But if you are looking for volume for value, this isn't it.  I'll have to update my review once I actually get to eat the dish i came here for... That French toast.  Recap: Environment, location, staff, ambiance: top notch Value: good. But be prepared to spend $$$ on meals for models. Pre or post eat.  z"}
{"text":"It is AUTOMATIC 18.5% tip  It's not 15, 18... but 18.5, and for a party of 2. It was just me and my friend. TWO PEOPLE.  Who do you seriously think you are?  I also missed this on the bill so I tipped on top. Yup.  The service wasn't fantastic. The place was elegant, but VERY expensive for the \"ok\" food you get. Frozen yogurt (in plain) is $8 -with nothing added on top. Just plain yogurt in a glass. I got the S'more Love $18, which is a tiny scoop of vanilla ice cream, plus the s'more. It was actually pretty good.  I wouldn't come back. I know better dessert places that don't enforce a tip. Also I hate tipping -but I always tip. I just hate it. Didn't I just pay for the meal -AND I have to pay 18.5% for the almost non-existent service?"}
{"text":"I've always wanted to come in here to have a pot of tea and try one there famous macaroons.....and I finally got my chance and let me tell you they did not disappoint.   Before entering the main restaurant you have to take a stroll through there chocolate boutique with enticing chocolates and macaroons displayed in illuminated glass cases. This restaurant just ooozes with luxury, from the plush purple velvet couches, chandeliers, black walls outlined in white molding and mirrors it truly makes you feel like a princess!  They offer 12 varieties of tea and bring you over not only a menu describing each tea but little jars of the tea leaves so you can smell them and see if they are truly to your liking. Teas are all $10 a pot and come with a macaroon. The pots are Huge and coming out piping hot, I had to wrap my napkin around the handle to pour it.  Bukhial - Rich full bodied Indian Black tea with unique malt and honey flavours  It smelled and tasted exactly as described, the best black tea I have ever tasted!  Swiss Schoko - Ceylon black tea layered with chocolate pieces, vanilla, almond and calendula Yummy scents and notes of chocolate in this tea, it was perfectly suited for a chocolate lover like myself.  There macaroons are simply divine! Perfect texture, the right balance between crispness and chewiness.  Chocolate Macaroon - Not overly sweet, you could truly taste the richness of the cocoa.  Coffee Macaroon - My favourite! Again not overly sweet but perfect coffee flavouring sandwiching a delicious coffee butter-cream filling.  On my way I couldn't help myself from purchasing something from the chocolate boutique.  Milk Chocolate Bacon Bar - Caramelized peanuts with hints of bacon to add smokiness and to balance the creaminess of the 34% milk chocolate  Sounds gross but it was a delight! There chocolate is soo creamy and silky, the bacon flavour was very subtle you might not even notice it but with the caramelized peanuts it gives a play on sweet and salty and provides great texture."}
