{"text":"Placed an order, once delivered was missing food. When I called they told me my missing food would be delivered immediately... a hour later; still no food. Requested refund and they refused telling me to contact the website... THEIR INFO IS ALL OVER THE WEBSITE!   Will never order here again."}
{"text":"Love this place. Our go-to Chinese delivery. We frequent the lo mein, pad Thai, and fried dumplings. Only small down side is they aren't lying when delivery takes 45min- 1 hour. But worth the wait."}
{"text":"We loved it, needed something quick before heading to the airport and found this place. Very good food, nothing to complain about as far as what we had. Would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Fairly typical Americanized Chinese food...large portions but not that great in the taste department.  The Wonton soup had a relatively flavorless broth and the meat in the wonton was sketchy. I had a General Tso's Chicken and although the sauce was okay the meat was not fried to my liking. We did also share an order of teriyaki chicken skewers that were good, but that was not enough to save the rest of the meal.  \"One and done\" on this place."}
{"text":"Not terrible.  OK, the steamed dumplings were terrible. The meat had a really bad aftertaste that will likely leave me sick in the morning.  The Chicken Fried Rice was mostly yellow rice with a few tiny bits of Chicken. However, I was surprised that the Hot and Sour soup was actually not bad....not good....but not bad. Also, the fried chicken wings were overlooked and dry, but the flavor was pretty good.   Staying at the Holiday Inn, this is literally the ONLY delivery available other than Pizza."}
{"text":"Food is below expectations and the place is dirty. Seen people come in from taking out trash and walking in with out washing their hands. Its gross"}
{"text":"I love this place! They deliver very quickly, so fast that they actually bring my food quicker than the chinese food place closer to me! Their food is simply amazing, so don't be afraid to try menu items that you may not think you'd like! Truly a wonderful restaurant, thank you for such amazing service and food!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for Pad Thai go someplace else. What they gave me smelled bad, and was WAY over seasoned with salt. It was inedible.   For a carry-out Chinese place this falls horribly short of already low expectations.   The only saving grace of the food was the fried dumplings.   Sad. Just embarrassingly sad."}
{"text":"I get takeout from Dean House a few times each year. The food we order is always good: tasty + fresh. We usually order beef with broccoli and Singapore noodles. Both dishes are always satisfying.   Prices are reasonable. Service is OK. There are maybe 2 or 3 tiny tables if you want to dine in, but the atmosphere isn't all that."}
{"text":"If you want Chinese food delivered to you in Strongsville, the pickings are slim. Dean House is sub par and that's being kind. I usually judge Chinese food by their egg rolls and theirs are awful. 2 stars because their sweet and sour sauce is good. Its got a nice rich tomatoey color, not that neon jelly other places have."}
{"text":"Pretty standard fare. It's cooked in front of you, so it should taste better. The menu had a lot of variety. The basics like the roasted pork fried rice is ok, egg. rolls are bland, and sweet & sour pork is mostly breading.  This is only take out place. You can call but when I was ordering it didn't seem to go well for who ever called. There just isn't a lot of good Chinese food in strongsville."}
{"text":"I  have been ordering from here for about a year now, best carryout Chinese in the area. Always quick , fresh and amazing good!"}
{"text":"just delivered to my house and left because i didnt have a pen to sign...called the restaurant and no one spoke good enough english to understand Have ordered more than 20 times before and will never again due to how rude this experience was.Just hope i see the the credit to my card which was already charged"}
{"text":"Quick and good Chinese take out place. Appetizers are well done. We especially enjoy the fried pot stickers and crab rangoon, though they have a generic name for the latter.   Lo mein is very credible, but not top notch (Hunan on Coventry is tops for our taste of lo mein). Singapore noodles, hot with curry, is also good. Sadly, the hot and sour soup is not a favorite."}
{"text":"Food Was cold and just ok. Ordered 2liters when food arrived I got cans of soda. I called and the lady only said sorry we out. I explained I wanted 2liters since there was multiple people eating. I also asked why they couldn't call to say they were out,and all the lady said was sorry. Never offered to reimburse me. Won't ever order from here again."}
{"text":"This place must have changed owners. It used to be my favorite Chinese place to order from! Now, it is 100% garbage.  We ordered food for four and they only got one order correct. The egg drop soup smelled like the eggs had gone bad, the chicken tasted like the oil hadn't been changed in years, and the rice was rock hard! This is all not to mention that half our order was missing! Please do not eat here!! I would hate for anyone to waste their money and risk food poisoning. I'm SURE we all would have been sick had we not chosen to skip dinner that night."}
{"text":"Disgusting! Felt like I was on Fear Factor, except I paid to eat there.  Everything was funky.....taste, smell, texture. Wished I read Yelp before ordering.  Even the white rice was really odd.  Can't put my finger on it, but it was like extra dense and just strange.  Have never had a Chinese place mess up white rice.  Shrimp toast was oddly large, burnt, smelly and can't imagine what decade the shrimp was from.  Teriyaki sticks could have been squirrel.  So gross, threw out most of it. Oh, and it took an hour and a half. Would not eat here for free! At least I did not get maggots like a previous poster.... I think?? God help me tomorrow."}
{"text":"Deans house is where my family goes for Chinese food whenever we eat out. We usually get the dinner for three, and get rice, noodles, 3 kinds of meat, and some wonton soup. Everything is standard Chinese fare, not great but it's good. Not sure why there's so many negative reviews."}
{"text":"Not very good strip mall Chinese food. Ordered the chicken lo mein which is basically noodles and soy sauce.  The sweet and sour chicken is out of the freezer and the chic pad tai gets a 2 out of 10.  The front of the store was littered with boxes of junk and boxes of product.  The wait staff was average at best and they didn't have a plastic fork.  If u want below average Chinese his is the place for you"}
{"text":"I have had very good food from this location. I have tried several Vegetarian Dishes and all have had great flavor and were cooked just right. They are usually so busy the wait is the only thing that I found negative for them and really it just means a lot of people are ordering their food. So maybe not a real negative overall. I did not have any issues over my last several orders but I do pick up and it appears the issues are with delivery. Hope this review helps someone try them out."}
{"text":"Pretty typical americanized chinese food, but don't we all crave it every once and a while?    The best part about this place is the online ordering - I placed my order, told them what time I would be there and paid all online.  It was perfect for a rushed lunch.  Nice people, and don't get me wrong, there was nothing \"wrong\" with the food - just typical."}
{"text":"Just ordered through Eat24 and food was great! Reasonably priced and delicious. We had a good sized order and nothing was missing - also the delivery wait was not too long. Definitely going to order again from here again."}
{"text":"They do good Chinese food - if you're looking for Pad Thai, go to a Thai restaurant....like the one right across the street. If you want Japanese, go to one of the many around. If you want Chinese takeout....this is the best one in Strongsville. The sweet biscuits are a big hit as well."}
{"text":"Took an hour and a half to get an order of chicken teriyaki and sweet and sour chicken delivered. When we called after an hour to ask when we should be expecting our food the lady was very rude and kept put me on hold multiple times. When she put me on hold she would leave me on hold for minutes and I could hear her screaming in the background. No apology or anything. We used to order here all of the time- I will never order Deans House again."}
{"text":"I love it here and I'm picky about my Chinese food. Always delivery, never picked up. My favorite is the Mongolian beef, extra spicy, (so spicy, so good) extra meat with a wonton soup. My husband gets the same with the hot and sour soup. Yummmm!!!!! I've now become a regular ordering delivery just about every week."}
{"text":"The best chinese food in the area! The food is always super fresh and the staff is very nice and accommodating. I've been a customer for 5 years and have never been disappointed!"}
