{"text":"The tacos at this restaurant were absolutely delicious. The queso and chips are definitely worth ordering! Great outdoor patio for dining outside this time of year.  Can't wait to see what's added to the menu in the as they get established."}
{"text":"Ordered this on uber eats and will definitely order again, the chips and queso and the churro were amazing, but the chicken burrito was definitely lacking a bit in the flavor department--and that's considering I got all the additional add ons. Nothing a little siracha can't fix; I'm also sure they have a wider array of sauces and whatnot at the restaurant itself but I don't know for sure. I would still definitely order again and would like to check out the restaurant in the future. The prices are also really good in comparison to the other taco places in Tempe."}
{"text":"Best street tacos in Tempe!!  Secret pickle fries, queso & chips, chicken tacos, roasted tomatoes & peppers salsa ... authentic.  Incredible food!  Full sports bar. Friendly staff.  Very clean.  Churro for dessert.  Loved... Rural/Apache in Tempe."}
{"text":"This hidden gem has become my go-to for tacos and drinks. The atmosphere is laid back and there is always either good music or the local sports (Sun Devils, Cardinals) on the sound system. They have options for both quick serve food or full service at the bar if you're looking to hang out. The menu offers both authentic street cart style tacos as well as delicious flour tortilla style tacos (my favorite).  The food is always quick, quality and bursting with flavor. They also added new menu items recently such as their mouth watering churros which are my new weakness every time! One thing I was surprised (and thrilled) to see was how inexpensive their beer and alcohol prices are compared to Mill Avenue and other places to drink on campus, especially the Blue Moon! The bartenders are always bubbly and friendly and they always have new drink specials. I would definitely recommend this place for a perfect place to eat, drink, hang out, and get quality food + service at a great price."}
{"text":"Great great location! And phenomenal mild salsa! Tacos are okay but they hit the spot. Good place for late lunch or work break hangouts."}
{"text":"Some celebrity said \"I love tacos!\" so now I do too. I say so on all my right-swipey \"dating\" (meaning \"I'm 'just' here for friends\", yeah...) apps to look cool! Kim Kardashian and Lady Gaga said so!"}
{"text":"So, Sunday afternoon, I was craving for tacos. Look up Yelp, and found this place. Let's talk about the food since this is a taco shop. Pretty decent tacos since I had many in Mexico, but beware, they are tiny! You would need at minimum of 3. We ordered a couple of tacos and a bud light. Okay, we ate quick and got out of there in like 15 mins, since my partner was expecting a call. I didn't finish my beer so I bring it out with me. I got into the car and this girl knocked on and said \"give me that, are you an adult?\" Took the beer and walked away. Wtf? B*tch! I'm from Nevada and we do that all the time. I didn't know, it wasn't like I sneak the beer out or anything.  What kind of attitude is that? I paid for the beer. Even if it's not allowed, she should have explained to me.  If we were not on that call, I would have say something to her face. If you are the owner (the girl that followed me out) please grow up and choose your words, and learn to deal with customers the right way.  I would NEVER come back to a restaurant with that kind of behavior. If she's an employee, I beg the owner to please fire that girl, because she's causing you money with this kind of attitude. There are plenty of college students that know how to treat your customers properly. The tacos deserve 4 stars, but the service is 1 star. So average should be 2.5 Stars (there's no option for me to give half star).  Omg! What an ass!  I wish you burn in hell, along with your business."}
{"text":"3 of us went this past Sunday night with my pup, and were warmly greeted and the owner - Cameron - was very attentive to us. Of his own free will, he brought out water for my pup, and consistently checked up on us. Service was fast, food was incredible (and i'm particularly picky with my tacos), great prices and cheap deals, and overall an enjoyable experience. Frozen strawberry margarita was PERFECT (not too sweet, not too watery). New fav local spot for a quick, cheap meal/drink."}
{"text":"Found this place on Friday after getting coffee across the street. It was 11:30pm and we figured we had more then enough time to eat since it said they closed at 1am.  We walked in and no one was there. I saw one guy running around in the kitchen and we awkwardly made eye contact...  I look to the bar and see that there is a tablet with a sign saying to place order there after a certain time. (It was that time)   I start to place my order when the tablet starts having issues. I have my cousin go and tell the one employee that's in the kitchen that we need help and he says, \"one moment.\"  That one moment turned into about 5min of us just standing there looking at him. The entire time he was talking to some girl and not coming over to help us.   So 0 stars for the crappy customer service, only leaving one because I can't leave no stars.  Oh and shoutout to the one customer who was sitting at the bar, at least he said hi to us."}
{"text":"This is honestly the worst service I've ever had. I should've realized this place was horrible when I walked in because there wasn't a staff member to be seen. However I decided to give it a try since there was another couple sitting down. We had to order on a iPad which was extremely confusing and had technical issues. Once we ordered no one called to tell us our order was once so once we got it or food was extremely cold. The tacos itself were just meat and unmelted cheese. I paid 9.00 for the absolute worst meal ever. Highly do not recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Value for money. Good frozen margarita and fireball shots. Everything falls under students pocket"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our tacos! We had a free chips and salsa coupon and then also got a quesadilla. Carnitas quesadilla was awesome, as were the chips and salsa. The whole salsa bar had a lot of variety and was great. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The food was okay, i ordered 2 carne asada tacos with flour tortillas. The carne asada could use more flavor i had to add salt in order to make them more enjoyable. Same goes for the salsa i tried all of them, and they too could use more flavor or be more spicy. Also, 50 cents for flavorless guacamole... come on. But besides the food i got good customer service, and it seems like a pretty chill spot for college students."}
{"text":"I think it's absurd they don't offer any fajita veggie burrito or taco options. The only \"vegetarian\" option is their bean and cheese burrito made with non-vegetarian beans. I'm vegan and can eat chips and salsa. Never encountered a problem at any other Mexican restaurant. Also, they seem to be open when they want and closed when they want and don't follow any specific time.    **i do not have UberEats downloaded on my phone nor have I ever ordered any food from your establishment. Your cook told me first hand that your beans are non-vegetarian because they use animal fat in them. (This is in response to the unprofessional response I received below )  Obviously this place doesn't take constructive criticism very well, as is evidenced from their verbal attacks on every bad review they've received."}
{"text":"Overpriced, way too small tacos, unmelted cheese and cheap meat, unseasoned all the way through. Couldn't even finish their burrito, and I love me a burrito (pic for reference). If they spent nearly as much time and effort on the food as they did making the place look chic for nearby college students, it might be worth the visit. If you're in the mood for tacos and burritos just head to the filibertos down the street. Also, even their hottest salsa is mild at best. Just a bad experience overall."}
{"text":"This was a great experience. Friendly staff, the owner Cameron was awesome!! The tacos and margaritas were excellent! I would recommend this to anyone looking for a quick and fun taco night. I would suggest the strawberry frozen margarita! I will definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times since they opened about a month ago. The staff are very friendly and the food is great!"}
{"text":"This place is great! I had been watching it be built for a couple months and was excited to try it when it opened. The staff is friendly, atmosphere is great, and food is amazing. I can't think of anywhere else in the ASU area that you'd actually want to hang out at and still get your meal for around $10. I've been going there weekly and look forward to continuing to do so!"}
{"text":"Definitely an a-ok place to quickly get tacos and a few drinks when I'm in the immediate ASU neighborhood. I came in on a Saturday evening after playing volleyvall and needing nourishment a la tacos. Ordered 2 tacos, chips and queso and a frozen marg (the girl had me at frozen & only like $1 more to go to the bigger size). It's been well-designed to be like a small and cute basement bar. I love it and the open concept!  Not gonna lie, they have a pretty bomb salsa bar. Unfortunately the tacos were fairly plain, likewise with their queso, and needed some extra lovin from the salsa bar. The queso also seemed a little over-priced for the small portion. At least they make a mean frozen marg!   I know they've opened fairly recently so I'm definitely willing to return and give them another fair chance. Looks like they have some daily specials that make for a fun evening."}
{"text":"I really dig Lemon Street Tacos, the place has a lot to offer. Good food, drinks, prices, location, layout, tv's. Totally sweet!!   However, I went in to get my debit card tonight at 12:15 (business closes at 1:00 am) and was totally ignored. There are 2 guys sitting inside watching Television and hanging out and neither of them came to the door, they' didn't even get up. They actually shooed me away haha! I guess the place was closed? But all I wanted was my debit card, after just spending $60 there the night before.   Disappointed in the lack of customer service provided, not a friendly move. Can't say it will keep me from going back but still..   Overall still worth it to check them out!"}
{"text":"Welcome to Lemon street\"Tacos\" and good luck getting the sour taste out of your mouth after you pay for tiny tacos with cold tortillas and hardly any meat. You can't advertise tacos and then offer what you do because your tacos are sad. Taco Bell offers better tacos and Taco Bell sucks. Even my whitest midwestern relatives would think your tacos were sad. Do you hate food? Who makes a taco like I had and charges money for it? For ten bucks I got 2 tiny cold corn tortillas, dusted with meat, chips and guacamole but no drink and a wimpy salsa bar. The salsa bar reminded me of what I can pick up in the \"Mexican\" section at any market but I think the Pico de gallo was fresh because it didn't have that pre packaged flavor of the others...I could be wrong though, it's hard to tell because the Pico was so bland."}
