{"text":"We came to this place based on Yelp reviews.  There were 12 people in our party without a reservation and they were able to accommodate us.  The waitress was friendly and very helpful as well as the owner being very attentive to us.  I had the gumbo with shrimp which was mildly spicy.  Everyone else in the party enjoyed the food and noted it was a great find.  A few colleagues stated they will be returning before the end of the trip.  Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Service: the waitress was clearly knowledgable of the entire menu and was friendly and kind. The food was delicious. I had a burger and it was one of the best burgers I have had in a looooong time. The curry cawliflower soup was fantastic. They know what they are doing there. A+"}

{"text":"Excellent restaurant sur le bord du Lac-Saint-Louis à Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue. Nous y sommes arrêtés lors d'une ballade à vélo et nous n'avons pas regretté notre choix. Le service est efficace et courtois (et en français!), et le menu est varié et appétissant. La terrasse est entourée de verdure et offre une vue sur le Lac. Nous avons pris les crabs cakes et ils étaient délicieux. Très bon choix de table d'hôte. Nous recommandons!"}
{"text":"Friendly and attentive service. Feel like having nice meal at someone's vacation home.

Bread was ok. Warmed up dinner roll so it gets dried up if you don't eat fast.

Overall food were just ok but most broth were very diluted... as if these were meant to be heated till get some reduction but wasn't boiled long enough.

Onion soup and gumbo broth were very weak. Fries were so dark, which made us think the oil was not clean..

Mussels were very tiny inside big shell.., disappointing. 

Rice for gumbo was like uncle ben's rice..

Fajita comes with sour cream, cabbage and cheese but no guac, rice or beans.

Sangria was ok but not very memorable. 

It was OK restaurant..

My friend really liked the rib."}
{"text":"Super atmosphere. Try the crab cakes! Deelicious. Menu seems a bit scattered - but they just opened. Very nice ambience."}
{"text":"We decided to check out Ste-Anne de Bellevue this evening and stopped in at Bord'Eaux. Really nice atmosphere and terrific service by Bernie and Zita. The table d'hôte was well priced and had plenty of options. If you're looking for a nice upper end pub fare - this a great option!"}
{"text":"First time visiting tonight.  Beautiful restaurant with a really nice atmosphere.  Food was really delicious and we didn't feel rushed.  We will definitely be back.  Great place to go for date night with friends!"}
