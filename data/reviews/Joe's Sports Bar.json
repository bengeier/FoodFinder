{"text":"Foods good, bartender great she was very nice, BUT manager was very unprofessional drunk locals were unfriendly and would never recommend joes to anyone travelling. if I could give 0 stars I would"}
{"text":"The burgers were great haven't had a good burger in a long time.  The staff was very attentive and the beer was cold.  The have a great selection of bottles and draft to choose from.  Plenty of TV's so every table has a good view.  I will go back for sure.  It has that neighborhood feel."}
{"text":"Great late night place to stop and get something to eat. Don't judge this book by its cover, it really is a hidden delight. .."}
{"text":"Great Sports Bar..staff are great! Food is good..great atmosphere..everyone friendly ..just wished they had more live music!  Trivia night is so much fun..great place"}
{"text":"Good place to hang out and have a cold beer with friends. Nice patio to sit outside."}
{"text":"I've been there twice on a Sat. afternoon, had a good experience both times."}
{"text":"I've only been there about 5 or 6 times and every time it has been a different experience both good and bad. Food is okay and the service is decent."}
{"text":"Cool place to hang out and drink, BUT DO NOT order the food. Aside from the gross overpricing of the food, all the bar does is purchase frozen meals from the Food Lion across the street and microwave that shit. Im not even kidding.  Shitty, overpriced food aside: The amount of HD TVs is impressive, and as there are very few bars like this in our part of Concord, its a legit spot on gamedays and weekends. (Beware, it is a Steeler's bar - - - GO JETS!)"}
{"text":"We won't be back. We had a party of 16 people,  which we called far in advance with reservations. They were still unable to handle the group. Two cooks in the back and one server, two bartenders.  Our appetizer was forgotten about till way past the need for it everyone's food came out spaced so far apart that some of the food was 40 minutes in between from one to the next."}
{"text":"I liked Joe's. They have a bunch of HD TVs all over the room and 2 outside on the patio. They also had a beer I didn't turn my nose up at. The Widmer Drifter Pale Ale. Had the chili con queso and chips for and appetizer.  Nothing spectacular but it hit the spot. We had burgers for supper. They were good burgers. My wife had the home made chips and I had baked beans for the sides. All the food was very good. I think the beans came out of a can but they were good. Everything came out hot and cooked properly. The bartender, Rick, was very friendly and laid back. The atmosphere was good and there were an equal amount of Sox and Yankee fans for the game which Rick put on for us. Overall we had a really good time. Yes, even the Yankee fans were cool. As sports bars go it was one of the better ones. A real nice corner bar."}
{"text":"Walked up to bar and ordered a beer. Turned around and saw the logo of an out of state NFL team plastered on the wall...cancelled the beer and walked out. Will keep my eyes and ears open for the inevitable \"Under New Management\" sign. #keeppounding"}
{"text":"Joe's Sports Bar.  Well here we have your classic bar scenario.   Afternoon crowd: Older, \"lifestyle drinkers\" kicking them back before the younger crowd crawls out of the wood work. Country music blaring from the jukebox, real downers too. Songs about whisky, trucks and loose women. You can also find your cliche old drunk guy hitting on a girl too young to care, to drunk to notice.  Night crowd: Young, noisy, vibrant. Dare I say a little classier.. some just off of work from the office, others there for the big game. Smokier, though. But all in all the kind of vibe you would think a place like Joe's thrives on.  As far as the booze goes they've got it down. The bartenders are all chicks, at least every time I go, and they know how to have fun. One bartender has a heavy pour, which I love, especially when she makes my Midori and Coke. Another, not quite as heavy a pour but a much bigger smile. All of them pleasant and mostly, professional.  The food..well.. that's *another* story. I've been to Joe's on multiple occasions and ordered something to eat, as I am a firm believer in eating while drinking. I understand, clearly, that for the type of bar Joe's has established itself as that the food isn't going to be in the same country as a Michelin star or even a NY Times sneeze. However I don't believe that, reguardless of your atmosphere, there is any excuse for bad food.  The cook there, whose name I won't mention, really doesn't have a clue. My first meal there was simple. A BLT. Classic. The bread came out untoasted, the lettuce was slimy and the bacon was limp.  The second time, a second chance, chili cheese fries. The fries were limp, the chili laid on way too thick, cheese congealed.  A third time was another simple one. Grilled ham and cheese. The bread was toasted in a toaster, the cheese was not melted and the ham was cold.      Somebody get this guy a manual.  In the short: Recommend the booze, for sure. When they take out the food menu, run for your life."}
{"text":"Went to meet some friends, and wasn't very impressed.  It's not the most terrible place in Concord, but really not somewhere I'd go again.   There was a special on vodka, so I went to the bar and ordered a vodka on the rocks.  The bartender shoved me off pretty rudely, telling me that if I was at a table, I couldn't order from the bar.  I know that's fairly standard, but she was very rude about it.  Also, I waited 10 minutes at the table before going to the bar for service.  The drink itself was absolutely not even a full shot (I tended bar for a while, and it was maybe a two count.)    I didn't eat, and left shortly after.  I can get rudely ignored for free, so I'll save my $2 next time!"}
{"text":"Service: 8-10 minutes to get water (waitress sneered when we ordered a water to start out) we watched everyone around us get to place orders, get knapkins, to-go boxes, or top off a beverage over the next ten minutes. She didn't acknowledge our presence while we were waiting to place our food order - it seemed as if this was her way of telling us to F off for ordering water.   Food: Can't tell you, we didn't get that far! We decided to pack up and go to Needle Co. a few doors down. Noodle Co's food was excellent and service was fantastic!   If I could give zero stars, I would!"}
{"text":"Let's start off by saying I'm no fan of Sports Bars.   However, when one of my Charlotte area hosts suggested we go visit some friends at \"Joe's new bar,\" I didn't have much of a choice.   Me: What's it called?  Him: Joe's Bar  Me: I know it's Joe's bar, but what's the name of it?  Him: Joe's Bar  Me: Oh, so you don't know the name. Where is it?  Him: It's in Concord.  Me: It's where? It's not even on Yelp. How new is it? Did it just open. Maybe if I search bars in Concord it will show up and we can find out the name.  Him: That IS the name.  Me: OK, let's just go. What kind of bar is it?  Him: A sports bar.  Me: Ohhhhhh........(*dread sets in*)  Honestly, aside from the fact that the walls of this place are a horrid color - something my friend Amy and I deemed \"Little Boys Room Blue\", the place is pretty harmless.  I liked the patio out front (hated the smoking indoors). I liked the computerized jukebox that had every artist I could come up with (hated the fact that playing Guns n' Roses and Bon Jovi only costs $1 per song but playing any of my favorite artists costs $2 per song). Loved the brand spankin' new Ikea furniture feel in the decor scheme (again, hated the blue which screamed \"When I grow up, I wanna own my own bar.\" \"What kind of bar do you want, Junior?\" \"A blue one, Mommy, I want a blue one! Because blue is for boys!\")  Overall, it was actually a good \"Cheers\" type of place where, frighteningly enough since I was in Concord, most of the people in the bar really DID eventually know my name! And Joe was actually at the bar the whole time, which was kind of cool actually.  The best thing about this place is that if you're ever stuck in Concord (and if you're there at all...believe me, you're stuck), this is the only drinking option you really have. So, Joe's Bar it is all the way!  Good luck, Joe. Honestly, you're onto something here."}
{"text":"Great patio atmosphere in the evenings, and pretty good beer selection, although I am easy to please. Food is decent typical bar fare, and the staff is friendly.   I did ask regarding the previous reviews and what I heard was most of the staff that was problems in old reviews had been cycled out and new staff in place. It showed.   I would definitely recommend Joe's to anyone wanting to go have a beer, hang on the patio in the evening, or watch a game."}
{"text":"Had a great time with people sitting at the bar Food was absolutely delicious. Chicken quesadilla and  shrimp jalapeno. Food was out with in reasonable time.  Service was spot on. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Ok, so for a sports bar they have a pretty decent menu... I've sort of a foodie and I've ordered the wings, chicken tenders, BBQ chicken flatbread and the goat cheese log. All good, and I'd order again. Servers have been great. My only complaint? Not a single dessert offered!  At least throw a gallon of ice cream in the freezer, please! I might have to run over to Afton to order the cookie skillet!"}
{"text":"We really like this bar but have a few problems.  half the food on the menu is not on the menu.  They have reprinted an insert of what is not available.  Just re-write the menu and suck it up.  Service would be A LOT FASTER if the owner would let more than one person ring up orders and credit cards.  We watch the servers stand in line while the bartender had to run all of the credit cards.  She cant do both at the same time.  She is a great bartender but stretched too thin.  Love the food.  Always tasty. Never get rid of your buffalo blue cheese stick we love them!"}
{"text":"This place was the 2nd worst place I have ever eaten at.  I am not a picky person at all, but there were some serious lies on this menu.  We ordered \"homemade\" queso and tortilla chips, and we were served melted velveeta with the most stale generic store bought tortilla chips I have ever eaten.  These were like the stale version of the tortilla chips you get at minor league baseball games.  I was also not impressed with the menu.  I do not get why you experiment with such crazy combinations if you cannot get the basics right."}
{"text":"Loud, very loud both times I have been. Depressing beer selection and food is standard bar fair of standard quality. I would have probably given a better review If I could have had a conversation with my dinner companions. It's been a while since I have been, hopefully they have cut down on the deafening atmosphere."}
{"text":"I thought the quality of the food, for a sports bar, was excellent. The Western Bacon Burger I got was fantastic. Service was decent. However the restaurant smelled pretty bad of cigarette smoke - even though it just opened for the day and nobody inside was smoking. I'd classify a lunch for two at a sports bar to be 'pricey' at $22.  That hurts its value."}
{"text":"Borrowing a page from Chipotle  Interesting concept that I have only seen at a few restaurants in the area and then for only some select menu items. In this case the burgers.  You build your own burger choosing from the size patty and with and without bacon, then your choice of seasoning, buns, cheeses, garnishments and finally sauses starting with mustard and ketchup and working up.  My wife of the otherhand and Beef Bleu Flatbread or in other words, toasted flatbread with shredded beef, bleu cheese and a raspberry compote. Had a bite and it was were good.  On the inside it is a typical sports bar with plenty of TV's all over the place. Service was lacking since there was only one server at lunch plus another individual who I took to be the owner/manager/cook present at the time.  All in all, it's a inventive menu and food is quite good but they do need to address the service issue."}
{"text":"Ehhhh...this place.  I decided to give this place a try during my lunch hour based on the recommendation of other co-workers, and I'm so sorry that I listened. I came with two other co-workers and arrived to a pretty empty place for the middle of the day. We were greeted and able to pick our own seating.   We ordered our food and then proceeded to wait.......wait.......and..........then wait some more. Keep in mind, our orders consisted of a turkey wrap, burger, and fish so we were quite confused as to why we waited so long. (also we were also confused as to why the food was so overpriced) Cut to almost a full 30 minutes later, our food arrived. Great in that it was hot but there was no acknowledgement as to why we did and had to wait. Especially since the place was empty. So we had to do the not-so-delicate move of shoving as much food as we could in our face in a short amount of time.  Yes there are TVs everywhere and if you're looking to catch up on or watch the latest game, this place covers that need. However, if you want some decent food to go along with your sports watching, keep on driving. Maybe they think the TVs are a big enough distraction so you won't realize how truly bad the food is that you just ordered."}
{"text":"Terrible bar tenders, horrible service, bad food and terrible bathrooms. Rude... would not recommend. Go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"We were regulars. Definitely finding some where else to go. They fired tim and it just isn't the same. The server just can't keep up. It's like we do not matter anymore- even though we've been coming once a week for almost a year. Yall need someone like tim or hire some more help."}
{"text":"Nice sports atmosphere with excellent daily drink specials and really good pub foods like burgers, personal pizzas, wings, and dips. Friendly staff and not a bar chain feel."}
{"text":"We won't be back. Went on a Saturday night and it was dead. No one to greet us, bartender acknowledged us to tell us we could sit wherever we want and pointed to where the high chairs were kept after we asked. Even though it should've been obvious since we were carrying our 10 month old. Sat down  and our waitress finally came to our table. She was nice but smelled like she had just smoked several cigarettes. Felt very unwelcome so we just left. Very disappointed. Would give 0 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Nah.  Rude service and unwelcome atmosphere.  I won't be back.  Get a Panthers theme and some hospitality if you want to succeed.  Shameful cause it is in a great location."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a beer after work. Waiter was friendly and prompt with our order and refills. Very clean. Love the outside deck...too bad it was too hot to eat out there last night. My husband's buffalo wrap was delish!! I ordered the calamari which was good, not great, but good. The calamari came with fried jalapenos, which I could have ate as a meal....yummy!"}
{"text":"Eh. Wouldn't come back for the burger. Burger was dry, bun was dry, fries were dry.  If you want 30 TVs and a cold beer to watch the game I'm sure it would be great, but don't get your hopes up on the food."}
{"text":"Waitress was super nice.  Food was somewhat pricey But.. . It would be nice to have had a half order or half size wrap. I was only able to eat one half wrap and some of the potato salad. No, I didn't get a to-go box as I'm traveling today.  The avacado was perfect.  The bathroom was single person style and clean"}
