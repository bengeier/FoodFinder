{"text":"Its a okay burger joint, fries are good. But they removed there all day combo deal and just made it a drink and a hamburger and they charge you the same price without the fries"}
{"text":"Best burgers in Pickering!! Great menu & selection of toppings. Quick service & friendly staff. Definitely my new favorite spot, can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Food is good and decent portions.  Prices are on par with other fast food places, but the quality is better here.  Fries are great and not the awful stick like things they serve at McDonalds.  Staff are very friendly and polite too and the place is run by a family."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Kips for years, the food is great and the service has always been excellent."}
{"text":"Well let me start by saying that kips USE to be the Johnnys hamburgers of the east (those who dont know what Johnnys hamburgers is yelp it or just visit it). I use past tense because I went to kips the other day instead of making the drive to scarborough....boy did I regret that ! First of all it looks like it has changed owners the past few years but the burgers stayed the same.......not anymore. I ordered 2 cheeseburgers and it came up to $15.00 I was like holy $hit ! But I was saving the drive to scarborough so it evens out right ? Wrong !! I got home and took a bite and it was crap ! All I could taste was charboiled crappy meat ! I threw it out ! I was sooooo disappointed that I will never patron this burger joint again !!!  Johnnys ! You are worth the drive to Scarborough !!"}
{"text":"Awesome burger! Juicy and cooked just right not frozen! A lot of different options other than burgers! Staff is very friendly and fast! They Even have drive-thru! Looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Great little burger joint in Pickering. Reminds me of Johhny's Burgers in Scarborough, The steak on a kaiser is very good as is the souvlaki on a bun, make sure you have it \"Greek style\". The Greek salad is ok, but the dressing seems pre-packaged. always great service however."}
{"text":"I've passed by this place a thousand times and never stopped in. Big mistake! This is one of the best burger places I've been to. This is a made to order place not a cookie cutter chain. The homemade burger and sauces set this place apart from the others. The homemade chipotle mayo and jalape√±o sauces were on point! The service and helpfulness of the staff made the experience even better. I will go out of my way to come back, over and over!"}
{"text":"Good burgers, and the crew use to work at Johnny's in Scarborough"}
{"text":"Hands down the best burger place! Very clean and everything is made to order. Burgers are the obvious choice, but I have also tried the souvlaki and the steak. The souvlaki was very tender and flavor-full (it takes longer to cook but I promise you it's worth the wait!). The steak sandwich was amazing! Not chewy like other steak sandwiches I've tried, and they ask you how you want it cooked which is great.   The toppings are all fresh and they even have caramelized onions which got me really excited!   Oh and how could I forget the poutine!! Very big portion and they use shredder mozzarella which is so much better than the curds because this way you get a lot of cheesy goodness in every bite :)  Definitely will go back soon!"}
{"text":"This a great burger joint. Real meat cooked a grill with good fries or rings. Lot of the traditional toppings and friendly service.  The drive-through is goo too but don't expect McD's speed cause your burger is cooked to order from scratch"}
{"text":"Best service ever. Nicest owners who run a great business and always treat people with kindness. I will  come here whenever my travels take me East of Toronto. Too bad for me that  it is not closer to home. ( Veggie burger is the way to go for me but I hear good things about their 4,6 and 8 oz. beef burgers too)."}
{"text":"Late night in Pickering and there really isn't much to eat after the chains close down (and that's at 9-9:30pm on a Thursday). A quick search on Yelp and I found that a really well reviewed classic burger joint was only a few blocks away.  Kip's appears to be an old drive-thru Tim Hortons that's been converted into a divey looking burger shop. There's nothing wrong a spot that looks a little dated and run down, in my experience it's these places that put more effort into their food than anything else - and ultimately that's what counts isn't it? The difference would be divey AND Dirty but Kip's is spic and span for all your burger lovin'.  I didn't waste much time and simply asked the cashier what their most famous burger was and she responded with the classic 6oz. I ordered that, added cheese, bacon and all the fixings. I was told to sit and wait while they prepared it and within a few minutes, it was put through the pass-through between the dining room and kitchen.  The burger was really great, hard to tell if the patty itself was fresh or frozen but having seen them being loaded on the grill I'm going with frozen - it was a very flavourful and perfectly cooked burger patty.   Overall experience was good. I'm definitely making this a stop in the future when I come to visit my grandmother in Pickering  Eatcrest Out"}
{"text":"Best burger joint in Ajax/Pickering! Got a 6oz bacon cheeseburger with a banana chocolate milkshake. Amazing."}
{"text":"Used to be the best burger that isn't a Chain restaurant... however now truly disappointed. Food and service is quite slow, toppings aren't fresh mostly taste like stale canned food.   And plus the price is outrageous. We ordered 2 meals and it was about 31$. There is definitly tastier options for that price and bigger quantity. The burgers kind of looked like the shape of the Costco Kirkland lol.   Dont recommend"}
{"text":"Not a bad little place.  My amigos at work were talking about this place and had expressed that they have heard good things about it.  Hey somewhere new, I'm in.  So friday, a group of us piled into my car and went on a burger adventure.  I had this massive 8 ounce burger which i must admit was pretty good for a fast food place, but it was the onion rings and milk shake that stood out.  The onion rings were nice and crispy and pretty much the way i like 'em.  But the milkshake was pure chocolate joy!  So price wise, its a bit more than the usual fast food, but the food is better than the usual fast food, so i suppose thats the balance that makes it all worth while.  I think they deserve another visit soon, they had some other items that looked interesting and wouldnt mind giving them a try."}
{"text":"Ok so the staff is mildly pleasant and the service fairly good had the aloha burger which is a normal burger with a slice of grilled pineapple in it , oh my gosh it was horrible the burger was bitter and weird tasting if not for the pineapple to kill the bulk of the bitterness I would not have managed to force it down the onion rings are small portions and again for some reason bitter and odd tasting ,my wife had the steak well done she said it was flavorless and when I looked seen it was still bloody in places. . Never again!"}
{"text":"It was 8:55p on a Wednesday night and I was 20 minutes away.  Called to ask about their closing time and she said 9p, and unlike most places that would send you down the road, instead she asked me about my situation.  She then then took my order and told us to head on down, pick it up in the drive though \"I'll have it ready for when we got there\".  She got things prepped for us but waited till we got there to broil the patties and cook the fries, said \"...I wanted you guys to have it fresh and hot, tastes best that way (smile)\".  Love!  The 6oz burger here is my prize choice because it's home made, never frozen (the 4 and the 8 are frozen patties).  Got it as a double with cheese and bacon with everything, including hot peppers in a lettuce wrap.  Served hot, flame broiled perfection.  Combo it with fries and a drink and boom, satisfaction!  The hot fries are crisp on the outside with just the right amount of salt and moist on the inside, just the way I love it.  My kids love the shakes too.  I've only been comming here for three years, but, it's still our go to spot in the hood.  Thanks Kip's!"}
{"text":"We love kips! best burgers in Pickering 100% everything  is great :) never had a bad meal"}
{"text":"This place is close to home and I drive past it all the time but I've never been here before now. I stopped in for a late lunch and I was the only diner at the time. I was greeted by a very friendly server who recommended the house-made 6oz burger so I made it a combo with fries and a fountain pop.  The burger was well cooked, with a nice crust on the outside. The fries were cooked a little past done, making them nice and crispy, just the way I like them. The burger was pretty good but I probably wouldn't choose the garlic mayo next time. It had a slightly artificial taste. Yes, I said next time. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Kips 8oz burger $6.50  Juicy and grilled to perfection with a nice outer crust on the meat. It was definately a big burger and very tasty. Loved the fact that there were outdoor tables where you can enjoy the burger in the open sun."}
{"text":"Burgers are the best in pickering!!! So juicy and the beef is really tender just the way I like it. The customization is endless it's just like they do it at Harvey's!! Always comes nice and hot. The combos are really good for the price. I always like to wash down a kips burger with a sprite."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place by accident and I'm kinda glad I did because the greek fries are awesome!! Their portions are big and they have a drive thru lol"}
{"text":"Before i begin, let it be known that i created a yelp account just for this purpose... Ive been eating at kips burgers for probably over 10 years when i am in the area.. its changed owners a few times but always stayed the same.. until recently.. well on saturday november 4 2017 i actually convinced my friend that kips burgers were good and so we went in to pay 20$ each for a way overpriced burger poutine combo.. when i recieved my basically 10$ poutine the gravy had a funny taste like it came out of a can of 80¬¢ st huberts and was physically seperating from being old as f&$#.. you have to keep gravy going for like a week adding water before it does that... Okay so with my poutine i get an 8 oz burger with bacon and cheese. Well the burger comes and its got a HUGE giant pocket of pink blood/ juice and uncooked meat in the middle of the burger.. so raw it dripped down the bun turning it all pink.. so i informed the guy working the grill and he did apologize and make me another he was a very nice guy you could tell he wanted to make things right.. however then i get the second burger and its the opposite, overcooked and dry.. now i hate to be a bother so i left with my overcooked dry burger, and now that i had a chance to taste it it was horrible.. tasted like they bought the cheapest wal mart tube ground beef and made these burgers and froze them for a long time.. they taste of cheap and freezerburned meat.. its actually horrible and i ended throwing out this 12 dollar \"hamburger\". When you pay that much for a hamburger you usually would recieve ground chuck or ground sirloin some kind of quality...usually.. not this place u get literally the cheapest funny tasting meat you can imagine.. actually everything was cheap from the burgers to the gravy to even the way the cheese melted was flippin cheap.. i never knew i could judge the melting properties of cheap cheese btw until yesterday.. and i can tell you this place is being run into the ground quickly.. i feel bad for the owner i can tell hes overwhelmed he has his whole family workin there he seems stressed and i feel bad for him but they have absolutely no right to be in business serving burgers of this quality.. if you cant cook and you have no passion to make the food good why do you own a restaurant? to sheist people for their money? i want my 20 dollars back honestly ive never been so dissapointed in a restaurant before.. and ive never tasted old freezerburned cheap ground beef like this ANYWHERE else, the meat qualitys literally the worst ive ever tasted in a burger period.. and im assuming the reason there was a pocket of disgusting blood in the middle of my burger is due to this frozen burger being put onto the hot grill.. and if it wasnt frozen, and it had this pocket of blood in it.. then id say some culinary retraining is in order.. when im paying 12 bucks for a burger fresh not frozen is expected.. quality meat is expected... Now to the owner, if you want to stay in business charging these crazy high prices you need to improve meat quality greatly.. that burger better be ground chuck or steak or something of value/flavor etc. Like i said ive never written a review on ANYTHING before thats how dissapointed i was.. now when the owner sees this, i dont want you to be offended, please understand this was my honest opinion and im trying to help, also realize it COST me 20$ to teach you this lesson, because i did not eat the burger after 3 bites.. take these points and use them to improve your business model, id like to see you succeed! You were very nice people.. and the one thing that was right was the fries i can tell they were double fried and crispy and thats the kind of effort id like to see go into the other products"}
{"text":"Burger was cold when I went to eat it. Didn't have enough time to go back and say anything. When I say cold I mean not even room temperature. It was a really bad experience."}
{"text":"If your in the mood and ready to eat big burgers and generous servings of fries, among other things, then this is your spot.  The menu is massive and everything is brilliant. great staff, awesome portions for the value, always fresh and very clean inside.   ....im getting hungry just talking about Kips."}
{"text":"A goood old fashioned burger and shake.  Nothing fancy and nothing healthy. Just the good stuff"}
