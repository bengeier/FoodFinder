{"text":"Love it.  One of my favorite things is the hummus. Yummy. The staff are all very nice just a cool place to relax and unwinfld after a long week."}
{"text":"Best hookah ever! They're so friendly especially \"temp\" he is so nice and he knows to fix hookahs, what a wonderful hookah lounge! I recommend you all to go there and try them."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Tut's for at least 7 years now. Very little bad I have to say about it. Hookah and drinks always come out in a timely manner and the staff is always quite attentive. They'll make sure you get fresh coals and a new bowl if your hookah needs it. 

And I absolutely love the upper seating area. The only place in the valley where you'll see me excited to sit on the floor. Get yourself a hookah, some arabic coffee, a nice corner with some friends you'll be set.

They have some screens that they show sports and stuff on and they play music (mostly pop, some middle eastern) but if you're friends you probably won't be paying much attention to it.

The only food I've ever had was the grape leaves. It was OK. Seemed like it had been sitting around for a while and I didn't like that it came out with yogurt sauce as I am vegan. It's the only place I've ever seen this done and I've eaten my share of grape leaves.

Admittedly, I haven't been to many hookah bars, but Tut's is so great I don't see why I'd go anywhere else. Don't fix something if it ain't broken.

Oh, and free wifi. Just saying."}
{"text":"The tricky thing about King Tut's is that, while you want to love the casual atmosphere and great selection of shisha flavors for hookah, its completely packed to the walls with ASU students.  Unless you're between the ages of 18-20 and you can't legally drink or enjoy the fun Tempe bar scene, avoid Tut's if you can.  Their service is slow and sometimes a little snippity - hookah is supposed to be a relaxing and enjoyable, social time.  But with half-drunk Abercrombie & Fitch'd frat boys and disoriented college co-eds hovering over your table so they can snag it the minute to stand up, you're not likely to enjoy yourself very much.  Leave this one for the kiddies."}
{"text":"This is a great place to just hang out, or to study, Especially it being so close to ASU. i just wish they had their WiFi working!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to hang out with friends and smoke hookah. The tender lamb gyros are delicious. Hummus is served with warm pitas. The seating ranges from booths to low to the ground lounging to outdoor tables. They offer several brands of shisha to smoke, but I recommend the Al Fakher shisha for its thick flavourful smoke.

Service was good. Staff regularly stop by to check the coals. A pop-punk Pandora station played the nights I was there, but it didn't prevent mellower tracks from the likes of Sufjan Stevens from showing up. Perhaps you prefer Turkish music, but the music sat well with me.

I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"King Tut's is the very first place that I ever smoked hookah. Unfortunately, there were a lot of negative changes that have happened to Tut's since 2002. I remember once going to Tut's and the clientele was a perfect mix of Middle Eastern and non-Middle Eastern. The music back then was ONLY traditional Arabic music. Yes the furniture and stage wasn't as nice but it was more traditional. But now, King Tut's clientele is mostly college kids; some that are respectable and some that fit the \"I'm a Big Douche at the Scottsdale Bar\" scene. What disappointed me the most was hearing Afroman's most famous song being played in their system.  That was it for me.  I would give Tut's a lower rating but I have so many fond memories of this place.  I'm hoping to go back there sometime and have it be like it was before, a traditional, respectable, hookah cafe...  if anything, at least their food has stayed consistently great over the years."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot, made a lot of friends there, the workers are extremely nice and fun. great environment. I would recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"This place is so rad! Staff is super friendly and the Sambosas are to die for! This is my go to for a chill night or a place to do homework."}
{"text":"Thinking back on this place, I was swarmed with how many times and fairly significant experiences I have had here.  Instead of stories I'll just throw some facts at you:

Tut's has the best hummus in all of AZ.  Try it and tell me it's not true.  They give you more pitas than most places and it is pretty darn cheap.  The Phoenician is the only other passable hummus competitor.

The people here are much more friendly and varied than at Oasis.  It reminds me a bit of a drama club room mixed with a Psych 101 class at ASU.

They started playing hip-hop at some point and I don't know if it has stopped yet.  Perhaps only on weekends.  It's off-putting.

I have been told many times that Tut's hookah is not as good as others, but then I've also been told that Red Sea has the best and no one wants to go there.  I don't notice any difference and I doubt most people do.

Get some hummus to go and your day will be brighter.  Particularly if you live in that area because it is kind've a downer.  Maybe sneak it into Plaid so you won't have to eat their god-awful food and can still have a beer."}
{"text":"Love it! Best I've been to. All of the workers are extremely nice and attentive, as well as simply making conversation and giving advice on hookah. Also very cheap, compared to other bars. Wouldn't go anywhere else."}
{"text":"I love this hookah place! My boyfriend and I come here often. We have never had a problem here. The staff is sweet and they bring out the hookah fast. It's our favorite spot in Tempe. :)"}
{"text":"I MUST talk about the food at this place!!

Okay, it was only recently that I decided to really try their food. and it was soo yummy! One time, I had a gyro and a seesh thoola (is that spelled right?) The second sandwich was a grilled chicken dish wrapped in a pita. it was so good! Their olive oil is quite good. The gyro was good too - a little greasy for my liking, but still yummy. 

Another time I went - i went with a couple of friends and we brought it down! We had a kebab combination. My friend had just a chicken kebab and I had a lamb kebab and the sheeh thoola combo and my other friend had just the lamb. It came with salad and hummus and pita as well as our entrees and rice and this one side dish of feta cheese, tomatos and i think sage? I didn't get to eat it because my friend ate it all! damn her! 

The hummus and pita was DELICOUS! and the rice was amazing. The kebabs were a little dry - I gotta admit but everything was good. I was really surprised. I thought it wasn't going to be that great. I wish we sat at a table becuase eating in their lil booths with just pillows on the floor was not very easy. We all got leg cramps that night. 

But seriously - the service is SHIT! There's this guy who is their waiter - if you're not a FEMALE under 25 and WHITE and BLONDE and a size ZERO and have HUGE tits... he does NOT give a shit about you! and that's REAL! I am SO not lying!! I've have been to this establishment atleast a dozen times and everytime - the story's the same. We go up and order our hookah... this employee takes the order is seems rather pissed to do so. I give him my ID and credit card and sit down with a couple of menus.

SEVERAL minutes later, our hooka comes and then we order our drinks and another quarter hour later our drinks come and then he seems CRAZY annoyed that we actually want food. I never care and just order anyway. There's been a couple of times when my friends wanted to eat somewhere else because of this guy's attitude. We order anyway. He reluctantly takes our order. We sit and wait... and wait... and wait... I search the room for him and there he is... standing over some girl's clevage as she giggles and twirls her hair. and FINALLY (one time 40 minutes later) we get our food. a-hole supreme usually plops our plates down and gives us more coles and is GONE. We never get refils on our drinks unless we beg another employee who seems like he's 15 years old.

When we're done - we flag him over from yet another table where he's now hovering over a different cleavage since cleavage number 1 has left. and he clears the tables and leaves us yet again. Until we're done smoking and then finally go to the register to pay. When i think about it... the service really does suck! but the food is so good and so is the hookah. I've come close to telling off the waiter of the year - but the tobacco and food always calm me down. :P"}
{"text":"Excellent relaxed, calm atmosphere. Great for having a nice conversation, or intense debate over a well prepared hookah. Friendly helpful staff, and good service. When preparing a bowl of Fumari, should be using a vortex or phunnel bowl to keep the flavor; otherwise you may as well be smoking Starbuzz, or Al Fahker."}
{"text":"Most of the other reviews said it but I'll toss mine in to confirm.  Geoff O. hit the nail on the head.  The food is good, the hookah is average - above average, the interior is nice, the service is good, and the crowd is absolutely atrocious.  The place is consistently packed with morons from various ASU frats and sororities.  They used to play great middle-eastern music, but changed to shitty rap by popular demand.  

I have never been there on a Friday or Saturday night where some idiot frat guy didn't walk in and go \"awww dude, we should totally put weed in these!!\"  

If you enjoy good hookah and good food, you have to go no further than across the street from Tuts to Urban Cafe.  All the good points of Tuts without the awful crowd.  

PS:  If you are a frat guy with a spray tan and a popped collar on a pink polo shirt, please stay at Tuts.  I'll be across the street at Urban and we can just respectfully loathe each other from afar."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for hookah in Tempe. The service is awesome and the atmosphere is very relaxed. After being subjected to the absolutely atrocious service and scams at Hubby Bubbly, I appreciate the staff at King Tut's so much more."}
{"text":"Try the banana-rama ... 
Free wifi & hummus. Kitchen closes early. Pro-tip: steal other people's leftover food."}
{"text":"I really loved the hummus and pita bread. I am big fan of mediterranean and make sure I try it every place I go to. This is my all time favourite. It was made so fresh and served so well. The hookah was smooth and non-ashy. Definitely worth the money! Not too costly a place also."}
{"text":"Great spot for Egyptian Middle Eastern Atmosphere, excellent home cooked buffet during Ramadan, really makes me feel at home!"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the generic-sounding name, King Tut's has been the perfect place to relax over hookah with friends. I love this hookah bar; it's been the perfect place to relax after a long week. We always end up staying longer here than I mean to, because of the relaxing atmosphere and friendly staff. I wish it wasn't so far from my house, or else I'd be a regular here. I didn't try the food, though, this rating is solely for the quality of the hookah lounge."}
{"text":"I love the food, I got the gyro and fries! With a tip it was only $10! The workers are so cool and friendly. They replaced the coals in the hookah frequently and made sure we had enough water. Cool atmosphere and fun people! 10/10 place to come hangout and smoke."}
{"text":"I used to love coming here for hookah and hanging out with friends. But the ASU frat boys found out about it and the place but isn't what it used to be. The foods gotten really bad too."}
{"text":"Small arrangement... very low music... these are some of the things i dislike about the place BUT customer service is great which makes up for the experience. And also they have good quality hookah."}
{"text":"This hookah lounge is just that, a lounge. It has very comfortable chairs and couches. There is a lot of room to spread out and get comfortable. This is a very important factor for Hookah lounges because you are smoking and trying to relax. 

Secondly, the staff is fantastic. They are very attentive. When you need coals they are right there asking you how the hookah is and if the flavor is still prime. If you feel like talking they will sit down for a couple minutes and chat with you, but they are quick to get back to work. 

Thirdly, the prices are fantastic. They have food and drinks for sale at this lounge and the prices are unbeatable. The food is incredibly good as well. 

If you're looking for a cheap, relaxing, and fun hookah lounge to frequent, this is the one for you!"}
{"text":"Good prices, great hookahs, good food! A very chill place to hang out with friends. Also free wifi"}
{"text":"Love this place! I've been coming here for a few years now and it hasn't changed. The hookah is reasonably priced and very good. We usually get the cherry mint or orange mint. I love their chicken shawarma and look forward to trying their Ramadan buffet. The lady that owns it is so sweet and polite and is always smiling. The people that work here are super friendly and very attentive. I would recommend this place to everyone if you want a nice chill place to hang out, smoke some hookah and get something to munch on"}
{"text":"Came here last night & thought it was awesome! Very nice people and the hookah was good as well! I got a vanilla chai flavored hookah and the mozzarella sticks-they were tasty. :) Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"King Tuts is a classic.  I have been coming here for years and it is by far the best hookah lounge in town.  They could stand to clean the bathroom though, its nasty."}
{"text":"Good flavors for hookah. All of my friends come here so I get dragged a long too. Service is fast and nice. The atmosphere is good and the seats are comfortable. For a good time, this is the place to be. If you are into smoking. Although, parking is limited during busy hours."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for the past 5 years and this place feels like a second home to me. The hookahs are the best around (I have tried every other hookah place in Chandler, Ahwatukee, Phoenix, Scottsdale, Tucson and Tempe) and the prices are the most reasonable (I like that they don't have a drink minimum like some places). The staff is really great and usually on their coal game, even when the place is super packed. They play awesome music that you won't hear anywhere else (Frank Turner & Alkaline Trio to name a few). It's a good, comfortable atmosphere whether you want to be alone or if you are with a group of people."}
{"text":"We were in search for good Mediterranean food when we stumbled upon this sweat lodge that happened to serve falafel. Upon entering this fine establishment, we immediately enjoyed the near complete lack of light, as one would come to expect of any quality heroin den. It was pretty hot inside and there was no air conditioning, but the one ceiling fan was doing a good job of circulating the smell of smoke, depression and sweat evenly. The food: falafel and fries were pretty bland, but washing it down with my tap water made it even better. 

I question the sanity of people who say they come here to unwind and relax."}
{"text":"Nice and clean hookah place. Great staff, nice seating, good music and ambience. Will have to try the food here sometime, everything sounds good. Also very accommodating for my service dog and brought him some water! Always a plus!"}
{"text":"I'll admit it. I have a soft spot for places where I can sit on a raised platform, recline on some pillows and pretend I'm the caterpillar from Alice in Wonderland.  No. It's pretty unlikely that the people here will be \"your people\"  whoever you are, and whatever you're into.  I'm thinking this isn't a place to make friends, it's a place to take friends.  Friends who enjoy gigantic water pipes with hose attachments so you can enjoy some exotic cancer causing treats.

Mr. T ordered the first round, with Rose and Lavender.  This was my first time at a Hookah bar, or as I call it, wrestling with the 2 armed octopus.  Apparently it's not that hard, you suck on the end of the hose where the hole is.  Although, if the person tending the other hose isn't either actively sucking or blocking the hole some other way, the pipe won't draw and you'll be stuck with a lung full of stale, non smokey air.  And seriously, if you wanted that, you could have just stayed at home and locked yourself in the hall closet.

So, keep an eye on your hookah mates and make sure they've got their hole plugged or a hose in their mouth.  Otherwise nobody is gonna enjoy the Sheesha.  After we were done with the first round, which honestly felt a bit like smoking those fancy decorative soaps at your friend's grandmother's house.  You know the ones? The little roses and sea shells and what not?  Yeah, the ones you got in trouble for actually using when there was a perfectly good bottle of foam for you to pump?  The ones that it was only later pointed out were for decorative purposes?  Yeah, well imagine the strong rose and lavender scents wafting off those soaps mixing with grandpa's pipe smoke which crept in through the bathroom vents to say hello and you have a pretty good idea of what that first round of Sheesha was like.

Anyways, after the soap round  - We decided to try grape next which was mellow and neutral and didn't really remind me of anything.  I mean, it was good.  But it was good by virtue of not being bad.  

All in all it was an interesting experience.  The place was fine, I didn't try any food but I might next time.  I was neither impressed nor unimpressed with the Hookah portion of the evening.  I mean, it was no opium den, but it still had it's own thing going and I can appreciate that on a few levels."}
{"text":"King Tuts isn't a huge bells and whistles sorta lounge, but it makes up for it in personality. It's a comfortable place you can smoke with friends and feel right at home."}
{"text":"King Tut's is both my scene and not my scene. Moving out here from New York, I was thrilled to find hookah places, and also one that was open late with floor seating in private booths and decent Egyptian food at good prices. The atmosphere is definitely a bit run-down in a good way, and the waiters are pretty on point, especially in dealing with such a huge crowd. 

But that crowd is the other thing. I was shocked to find that the hookah scene was primarily filled with frat boys and sorority girls. It still perplexes me how this crowd, many of whom seem completely uninterested in world culture, has made this place their home. Fine for them, but if you're not in that scene or an ASU student, be prepared to feel like you've just gone to Psi Delta Psi or whatever for their hookah-themed party where everyone knows everyone else.  King Tut's knows who their target audience is, and I always am annoyed when they turn off the loud Middle Eastern music for the latest hip-hop. It just makes it seem more like a frat party. I love a party vibe, but I also feel out of my element."}
{"text":"Great place to chill. Different style. I use to go there in ramadan and they had delicious food."}
{"text":"I am very much a fan of this place. One of my two favorite hookah joints, because the service is excellent, the hookah is great and the food is good as well. I haven't had much experience with the menu but what I have had was delicious."}
{"text":"The place is nice and dark, I like the seating. It is not the tradition way we see at American places. But you get a Turkish style seating. Their hookah was pretty good, food was alright.
I wish they serve alcohol or BYOB."}
{"text":"I enjoy this place every time!  Wish I lived closer, it's a very comfortable laid back place with good food and good smoke with excellent service! Never disappointed!"}
{"text":"King Tuts has it's pros and cons, just like every other Hookah Bar. It's pretty good shisha (if you get the StarBuzz as opposed the the regular tobacco), and the employees are super friendly and willing to help you if you need anything. Pricing is moderate, but worth it. Downside is the seating. It's difficult to find a good spot if you have more than 5 people. Also, it takes a little while to get your Hookah brought to you. But over all it's a fun time and I would recommend it!"}
{"text":"Definitely have good prices for the quality of hookah!

The location is great, close to ASU. 

I come here to study and sit outside when the weather permits. They have round table outside and is perfect for study group sessions. I love how its just a relaxing environment and the staff are super nice!

Their food selection is good too! I love their chicken hummus and their appetizers like chicken fingers, mozzarella sticks, and wings are also yummy!"}
{"text":"My friends and I have been coming here for a few years now, and we've always had a very enjoyable experience! The hookah is always really nice, the service is always really good, and the food is absolutely *outstanding*! My only problem is that I've noticed several times when they were either dramatically understaffed, or missing several food items from the menu. Several times we've ordered food and were told \"Oh, sorry, yeah we don't have that.\", which is fine. And several times we've gone and had to wait for quite some time since they were understaffed and \"Not expecting this many people\", which, again, is fine. A business like this is definitely more art than science, and not knowing when a table of 13 is going to show up can really throw a night off. But through it all, the staff has always been extremely friendly, the food and hookah have always been top-notch, and the overall experience has always been great."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've been \"out\" for hookah, and I must say I was pretty impressed with King Tut's. I've driven pass this place hundreds of times and I always thought it was a little sketchy, but once inside the place looks pretty chill & homey. Me and my friend were quickly greeted and had a seat in the front floor area while we waited for our two other friends to join us. We got started with hookah, some water, and some hummus. Now I'm no expert on hookah, but what we had was pretty good. We had a tangerine thingy....and later one we had an exotic one with pineapple, delish. 

It was pretty hoppin' while we were in, and they had rain to deal with on the patio, but our server was attentive and took good care of us. I would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"100 percent the best hookah lounge I've ever been to. I love how inviting this place is and the hookah is really good! Tim is the man!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty trashy, I'd rather smoke my hookah at home."}
{"text":"Not the best hookahs I've ever tried, but the environment is comfy and the service is good. And the hookahs are tasty and smokable."}
{"text":"Ive been a hookah smoker for 7 years and have worked at a lounge. The place had a lot of people. For a Sunday very diverse crowd. I wasn't familiar with that kind of raised floor seating which was cool but scary because the hookah on the carpets was a dangerous combo. The hookahs tasted as if I were smoking someone else's flavor with mine. I watched a man set up a hookah with yellow water wich made me question the cleanliness of mine. The bowl must have been packed too tightly because it looked full and I was coughing after about 20 min. Of smoking they were very accommodating to me and my friends. We did have to remind them of a smoothie we ordered about 3 or 4 times. But water was free so that was nice. The hookah came out first for my friend with a Chinese hose the standard wooden Handel with the little medal tips. Those to me are weak. So cheap. we asked for silicon hoses (D hoses) which we like and they got those for us. Prices were what I expected. Overall decent experience. Very nice workers for sure. Work space didn't look to clean. But overall nice decent place."}
{"text":"One of the best Hookah lounges by far that I've been too! I love the set up in there first off. Friendly staff, great food with cheap prices, and the Hookah is A1. I've gone about 3-4 times so far and will be visiting again. Definitely willing to recommend anyone to this location if you're looking to chill out and smoke some hookah in a good environment. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Very chill atmosphere in a place where you would think would be very busy. It's next to asu campus which i thought would mean it would be filled with a ton of kids and it's not! 

The service is great! Guy comes by and changes the coals on the hookah frequently. Great staff!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! They have the best mozzarella sticks. It can use a bit of a cleaning. Everything's kinda dusty and old for example the pictures and stuff hanging up. But I've never gotten sick and I always come here. There hookah is very enjoyable and this place is great for groups! the majority in Tempe that are under 21 but 18 yrs can have fun staying out somewhere open past 1am. Also, the people who work here are super sweet and attentive even when it is busy."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I've been coming here since 2010, never experienced a bad time. The hookah is really good, same with the food."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good hookah, nice friendly staff. Been going there for 20 years! Can't ask for more. The outside area is also very nice when the weather permits!"}
{"text":"I was so stoked to finally go back to this place and hang out. I used to come here when i was in my 19 and 20 and ot was such a cool place to chill. Once i pulled in i had to take a picture and send it to my buddy since it was him and i who used to hit it up! It looks the exact same! I was so stoked to get inside, order a hookah and some chow. Once walking in my excitement turned to confusion. I saw all the reviews saying how amazing this place was but the inside was literally the exact same, same paint, same carpet, same pillows.... I dont think they updated anything. The carpet was stained and had a ton of holes in it from the coals. I understand it happens but once it gets too bad clean it or replace it. The whole place was dirty, literally filthy. I went to the restroom and it was so gross I was afraid to touch anything.... Needless to say i left. Its sad to see such a Awesome place we used to hang out at all the time go down the drain."}
