{"text":"I've been here twice now and I'm not impressed. The set-up of the bar is strange, the bartenders are inattentive and I have yet to see people not look bored in this place even when busy.  Maybe it's me, but seriously, why do I need to wait to get a drink with two bartenders and eight people in the bar on a Wednesday!?"}
{"text":"Never going to the kareoke nights again. The first time I went, wanted to asked if the dj had a song. First she was all over the place talking to everyone instead of staying were she supposed to be. After she finally get to her place I went and said \"hi\". She kept looking at her laptop, I though she didn't heard me and said \"hi\" again. She angrily and agitated moving her arms around the laptop reply with \"can't you see am busy?\" I just walked away and went to talk to my friend of what had happened. As soon as the song was playing ended, she stop the music and take the microphone and start saying \"remember people I am very busy, blah, blah,blah\" my friends were really shocked and said to me \"did that bitch really called you out?\" We just leave without buying anything, because, you know, you don't treat custumers like that, specially if your job is as dj of the kareoke. Cuz of her we haven't gone to the bar again."}
{"text":"This place is awesome but to be honest the bartender makes his drinks way too fast. Ordered the mojito & pretty much tasted watered down."}
{"text":"Come to the Phoenix due to a friend's request. There was a party of burning man celebration a former bar tender was there and his friends. Bartenders were very unresponsive to us due to them wanting to party with their friends. The bartenders were doing shots during working hours. not sure if that's even legal in the state of Nevada drinking on the job. I would of been good if they got me a drink when I asked for it. After all I'm a paying customer. And local as well. When I tried to say something about it. One of the other bar tenders wanted to manipulate me into not saying anything to the manager with a shot or a free drink. I told him it's that that I want a free drink I wanted good service. The mangers came by and apologize and said he was going to talk with the bartender who was doing shots while on the job with his friends. That bar tender came over and smeared to apologize for the mis understanding. I told him there was no mis understanding he was just not willing to wait on anyone else but his friends. He said whatever with a big attitude and walked away. I will never return to the Phoenix for the poor service they provide. Being local there are plant of other options with great service. Flex, fun hog ranch my favorite, free zone, quad, among others. A business should cater to everyone not just their friends......."}
{"text":"One of the best gay bar any where is town . The bartenders are all great . I have always had a wonderful experience . Being there and watching the bartenders if they don't know you , they will .I have read all the reviews on the Phx Bars. If it is busy there ,some people just stand there not saying a word for a drink . Open your dam mouth . Has for smoking  ,get over it ,it is a bar .never had a problem with it . The food is great !
Good people, Good drinks and the Friendly  bar in town."}
{"text":"Pretty chill bar. Karaoke nights are fun/entertaining. prices are pretty good and bartenders are great and friendly!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Very friendly bar tenders. Looks like they really care about the customers. I like it!"}
{"text":"Awful. Tragic. Like an episode of dance moms exploded. The kj is rude and condescending. Save yourself the bother. Go to flex go to spotlight go to eagle go anywhere but here. Sad because this bar used to be awesome. Not sure what it is now."}
{"text":"One of the few places in town anyone can go hang out with anyone else without feeling judged. This establishment caters to everyone without prejudice and the vibe is very comfortable because of it."}
{"text":"The owners are great and very welcoming.  However
On Saturday night may 17th we had a large group
Go to the bar because we heard they had a 
Dj.  We requested a few songs and he played them with attitude
However when asked to play a third song he said
No because he had not gotten tipped and was very rude. 
We tip very well and he would have been very happy 
But because he was so rude he will leave empty handed.  
I hope the owners find a better dj. We would love to 
Come back"}
{"text":"I really like this bar. Conveniently located in central Vegas and in a safe neighborhood, The Phoenix has a lot of games, entertainment & events to entertain you.

The happy hour is generous, food is delicious & the bartenders are smiley, friendly & approachable. 

The place offers plenty of parking spots & seating options. I love their big leather sofa chairs & Wii games. 

If you've never been here, You should definitely give this cozy, fun place a try."}
{"text":"As gay bars go, this one is pretty darn friendly and fun.
I like that it draws a mixed crowd of genders, ages, and interests. 
Very nice that there is decent bar food available.

The added plus of this being a Burner hang makes it uniquely hetero-friendly.
Good vibes. Good fun."}
{"text":"Pros: Cheap drinks, live music or entertainment, friendly staff, Nintendo 

Cons: Insanely smokey,  food is so-so, when busy the limited bar staff shows

I've been here a few times but it really is not a place I'd go to if my friends didn't like it. The staff is quite nice and makes drinks right but the times I have been there and it got super busy they stuggled to keep up. As mentioned above it is insanely smokey, almost like they pump it in. The live entertainment is usually really good."}
{"text":"How did I not know about this bar? This is probably the best gay bar in Vegas! Super cheap drinks and relaxed atmosphere. This is my spot from now on!"}
{"text":"First off, ITS WAY TOO SMOKY in here!  The second I opened the door I was about to turn around because of the smoke.  So anyways, I came to see a friend perform, he actually did an amazing job, I was impressed!   As for the Video Poker, thank you messed up machine for taking 20 minutes for dealing me a royal flush with a deuce. ;-)  Slot tech showed up minutes after called.  Really would of stayed longer, but couldn't take the smoke."}
{"text":"Giving this establishment 3 stars just because I hadn't really stayed long enough to really make up my mind. 
I liked the set up of the bar being centered, and a performance area big enough for the other half of the establishment where patrons can sit in booths or high tables. Thought the gaming area on the other half was pretty cool. Maybe next time I'll try to get a turn at it. 
The drag show was cool, definitely liked the performers. Hahaha... They play games with their audience. What was hilarious was that they do birthday shots, which my boyfriend had to partake in 'cause his friend ratted him out. Also liked the friendly staff at the bar. 
I'll be sure to give it a more fair review whenever I get to go back."}
{"text":"Visiting Las Vegas for a work-related event and popped into The Phoenix mid-afternoon. I wanted to avoid the stuff of the Strip for a while and this proved to be a good choice.

The staff was friendly and appropriately attentive. Very reasonably priced and well made libations. Nice atmosphere that seems to avoid the standard LV schmaltz. 

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Went this bar to enjoy singing some karaoke with a couple of friends. None of us have ever been there before, went up and put our names in the rotation with about 10 people on it. We sat there for over an hour and a half while regular after regular sang and sang again without being called. The kj sucks and shows favoritism to the regulars. The bar itself was nice. A good atmosphere and reasonable prices. I would say go for the experience of the bar but not if you want tip sing and you are an \"outsider\"."}
{"text":"I came in on a whim...a lovely lady invited me to watch her DJ at this sexy little gay bar and I am now a regular. At first, you don't really know what you're getting yourself into when you walk through the wildly painted enclosure. Unleash the power of the spray painted Phoenix!!! Once inside you are greeted by delightful LED lights and strange pieces of art throughout the establishment. The bartenders are always pleasant to look at and my do they like to booze you up (one of my favorite things). There's a stage to one side with a mike overlooking a smooth dance floor, Couches for audience members and booths for nom noms decorated with exotic images of fire spinners. On the other side you find more comfy couches where you can destroy people at some super smash bros wii....if you look closely you'll see a collection of hulahoops just in case you're feeling frisky enough to give them a whirl...towards the back you'll find a massage chair- 1 dolla make you holla...2 moh will probably make you snohhh  oh...and a schmokes vending machine for when needed..(there is something sexy about smoking and gambling right at the bar)--last time i was there a man won about 5 hundo. I will say that when the atmosphere is jam packed of gamers and gays it can be a bit difficult for a girl to get a drink...a girl that isn't gay, that is..but as soon as I am noticed (which doesn't take long) I am being helped by someone.  But it doesn't end here (See review for The Phoenix Kitchen)"}
{"text":"This is hands down my fave gay bar in Vegas! They always have something fun going on. Their Facebook page is often updated. When they advertise their monthly Ladies night it isn't last minute! *looking at you Piranha ahem ahem* Staff are really nice even when they get slammed. Sometimes the drinks are way to strong but they are super inexpensive so I am not complaining! It has a nice local feel to it and it's nice and open so you can see people on the dance floor. 2 always busy pool tables in the back. The food is fantastic! I highly recommend the garlic fries! Food comes out quick and hot. They have a patio with a decent amount of seating for the size of the place."}
{"text":"This bar is, hands down, the best gay bar in Vegas. At least out of the ones that I've been to. Everyone there is super friendly, the DJs always got great music (always takes my requests and I don't have to wait 2 hours to hear it), really good food!!!! Like shockingly good! Bartenders are always really nice and extremely good at their jobs. Even the fact that there is a Wii inside for anyone to use is awesome. All the random little things throughout the bar make for a really good time when all of a sudden it's like 4am on New Years!!!"}
{"text":"Thank you very much to the staff of The Phoenix for your awesome hospitality, your mean Bloody Mary, the decent food, and the overall great vibe of your establishment. I can't wait to bring more of my friends back here and help keep our community connected! See you soon!"}
{"text":"Was not worth the $35 cab ride. It is as others say, very local, and really far out there. Wish I would've just stayed at Piranha."}
{"text":"The best kept secret in Las Vegas! The only gay bar in Las Vegas with LIVE ENTERTAINMENT regularly! Amazing Sunday brunches with an exquisite menu!"}
{"text":"I don't usually write Yelp reviews, but this place has some bomb food in an awesome local bar. Taconauts from Gary Tan from Roboduck truck, everything is reasonably priced, and the owners are super friendly and welcoming. The artwork on the building is a stand out of the entire city. I definitely recommend everyone trying it out, if only to get their delicious food from the kitchen."}
{"text":"Always a friendly place. The owners couldn't be more welcoming! Great crowd very local and welcoming of tourists."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I drive past this place all the time on Sahara and always wondered what it was. We couldn't figure it out as it has no name posted outside. We would make wild guesses like a secret  society meets here or a super Asian nightclub or....we were just so confused. 

Then one day with nothing to do and happen to be driving by we thought \"let's check out that fire pheonix place with the colorful ball lamps.\" Lol. Well, excitedly we pulled in, walked up and opened the door to the greetings of a giant rainbow flag. Ohhhhh....that makes sense. We had a good laugh as we finally figured out what this place was. We popped our head in to check it out then kindly left as we weren't feeling a bar scene at the moment (I think it was 6pm at the time).

So we leave and look this place up online, since now we knew the actual name. Then to our glory we saw the burner Mondays flyer. So excited to see burners outside of Black Rock City; We returned the following Monday. I will say it takes a bit for the regulars to warm up to you because they are literally there every Monday (or more). But the rest is history. 

Bottomline: 

Fun place. Lots to do here...drink, video poker, play pool, sing karaoke, play video games and be gay. Happy that is. Well in both respects. 
My boys love it here. My burner boyfriend loves it here. Kind of a one-stop shop in my books."}
{"text":"Fun neighborhood bar. Patrons genuinely seemed to be enjoying their time here. Main bartender is rude and doesn't know what he's serving (minus one star), but the kitchen serves really delicious food."}
{"text":"It's my first time here. It's 5pm and after I got my beer I sat down and saw its happy hour. The bartender didn't even mention it's buy one get one. So I'm stuck with \"buy one and that's all you get\"

Update: they honored the buy one get one. The guy with an awesome Mohawk came to the rescue...how can you not love this place after this gesture?!?!!!"}
{"text":"Good Bar, popular on certain night. On Karaoke nights very festive. Sunday's Broadway Musicals fun fun fun. Best food service / and food in Las Vegas come and eat here!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a genuine local neighborhood bar to take a vacation away from my vacation and I found it!  Bartender Eddie poured quality drinks with a smile!  His streaming music was the best!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"First time here!  No closing time. Great tunes. Sexy bar staff! Definitely visit when in Las Vegas. Thanks for a brilliant night x"}
{"text":"Always a great bar to hang. Any day and anytime! Bartenders are fun and fast. Great crew. You can gamble, play pool, video games, and they also have a kitchen you can grab food. The food is amazing as well with a good price. I believe everyday they have some sort of event of difference kind so to keep the bar entertained and fun. Definitely like this bar."}
{"text":"Went here to try to explore the scene on Wednesdays. Regan and Mindy were extremely helpful and professional, and ensured that my experience was nothing but positive. They are great informational resources, in many regards to aspects of/about the city and the people here. Drink prices are phenomenal if you come in on the right night, and the scene is full of lively and friendly people. The owners really set a standard for amazing service as well! I will definitely be returning in the future, along with my friends."}
{"text":"Watched the Oscars here with drag queen mc's..great time and great Friendly bartenders"}
{"text":"Gary and Katie are my favorites. They love people, places and things. Everyone else is amazing but I can't remember how to spell their names..."}
{"text":"I met up with a few friends here for a drink, and to hang out with the girl I like. I got there around 2am last night. (January 1st 2015) The guy bartender was nice, got me my drinks. No big deal. Then the issues with this place started. A bartender for this place was there on her day off bought myself and the whole bar a round of drinks. About an hour later comes over and not only starts hitting on the girl I was with but told me. \"Your cute don't get me wrong, I would take you out of here and bang the shit out of you. But your not gay. Your stripper gay\" and continues for the next 10 minutes to openly flirt with the girl I was with. And kept begging her to come in when she was working. The girl I was with was drunk and mistook this bartenders flirting for kindness so I let that one go. But seriously, that's the type of people you hire. Who insult customers and flirt with their dates? First time here and I will never go back. Last note, I'm a lesbian. Pretty sure I know my sexuality. Don't insult your clientele. I will never, ever in my life come back here. And I pray of your a lesbian don't go here. This bartender works everyday except Friday and still goes in there. She has a huge issues with us. One way or the other."}
{"text":"One of the best gay bars I went to in Las Vegas.  The bar has an open floor plan.  Off to one side is the rectangle bar, in the back is the kitchen, and in the middle is more seating.  In one corner they have an area that people play video games.  The bartenders were friendly and eager to help.  Drinks were strong and reasonably priced.  Check their website for drink specials and nightly events.  They have some killer marketing and branding.  

The video poker at the bar is popular and fun way to pass the time."}
{"text":"They drinks were priced really well and good. 
This is the 1st bar my friends wanted to visit in Vegas and tho it was basically empty we still enjoyed our time. 
I think this bar maybe really fun when it's a crowd, I'll definitely visit again on a more packed night."}
{"text":"First time at this place. Went there on a Friday. There was a drag show or something. First time at this gay bar. The drinks were fairly cheap and $20 all you can drink. Not sure if they do it often or if it was a promotion they had. People are very friendly there only thing is more bartenders are needed. Took a while to order things. But bartenders were very cool."}
{"text":"The drinks here are fairly cheaper compared to other bars I've been to. The food here is also quite appetizing for the price. Aside from drinking and eating, there are a variety of activities to do such as playing video games, scrolling through the jukebox, playing pool, participating in any daily events such as karaoke or screenings, etc. I may not be an active bar hopper, but this is actually becoming one of my favorite spots."}
{"text":"I used to go out all the time I promoted clubs and was in the gay community for a while and I've been out and for years I had a good relaxing time and met a lot of people I new. Like DJ panda"}
{"text":"Love the service, the food was amazing the drinks were great. I went on a Tuesday and it was Tuesday trivia the atmosphere was so relaxing that I was there for several hours. Great bar!"}
{"text":"Ok first off I love this place great food and entertainment. I have to say the food here hands down one of the best places you can get grub!!! I had preserved the rib and expected so so ... however that was not the case it's freaking great!!! The drinks are cheap the people are amazing can't ask for a better bar and lounge! 

Best,
K.Kaviar"}
{"text":"The Phoenix lounge has THE best bartenders, THE best bar menu, THE best performers, THE best week day and weekend events, THE best DJ and KJ and THE best interior AND exterior design! A very welcoming environment that just keeps you coming back for MORE!!!"}
{"text":"So nice I had to do it twice!...Im here from NYC on vacation and dropped in Sunday for Karaoke and had so much fun that I came back Thursday to do it all again! The host Sheila is amazing, funny, welcoming and a fabulous singer. I have NEVER had such great sound from any karaoke Mic and sound system before, even in New York. There are no song books or slips of paper, just tell her your song and she even adjusts the key to your voice as you sing. There are 2 great pool tables and good not busted sticks like in New York!... lol...truly warm and friendly staff and bartenders...fun crowd, couches, you can play slots and you can play video games!.... stop by...and don't forget to order the amazing chicken fingers"}
{"text":"great place, great people, the barmen are nice and funny and the cost of the drinks reasonsble, il'l get back there for sure."}
{"text":"I passed by decided to stop in to check bar out it had a good vibe and food was good ....Ill be back again!"}
{"text":"I love love LOVE this place.  Other than the obvious things, they have the BEST food in town!  The Taco Nauts are life changing.  

mmmm"}
{"text":"Nice local bar, people are friendly not too many queens. The food is really good and the staff is nice. It's the only gay bar I found with hookah service. Prices were reasonable and I will most likely go back."}
{"text":"We enjoy coming here for happy hour they always have 2 for 1 on drinks! They also have some specials on appetizers. My favorite are the taco nauts! Be sure to stop by and enjoy some drinks with your friends."}
{"text":"OMG! I LOVE LOVE this place. My husband and I come here for karaoke. We love to karaoke at the gay bars. So much more chill. When we first came here kareoke was lit. I will never forget my first time coming here for karaoke and I had an edible lollipop and I had a feel drinks and I was just posted on the couch in front and all of a sudden the ediable had hit me and I started to trip lol I for real thought i was on GLEE. Everyone was having a great time, laughing and singing along to the songs. They have board games in the corner and you can play video games on the projector. Lets not forget the condom jar lol the bartenders are awesome . the food is AMAZING! excpecially those wings. The only thing I order there food wise. Anyways. This place is cool and fun. Gotta check it out if you havent."}
{"text":"Love this place. The bartenders are super nice and there's always something fun going on. This is a great hangout spot for all, not just the LBGT community. Owners clearly support local artists and good causes. Great vibes."}
{"text":"Noise levels are ridiculously high. Mainly from other patrons. Prices are also competitively high. Service is terribly slow, and the Bloody Mary was not made well. Tasted like it was thinned down with lemonade"}
{"text":"UPDATE 6/28/16: So I've settled in town and to this day, this is my favorite gay bar. The locals come here for many good reasons--friendly staff, cheap drinks, accepting cards (unlike others that only take cash), themed nights, and so much more. I'm impressed with all that there is to offer here!

Shawn is one of the owners and is always receptive to feedback and opinions. He makes sure everyone feels welcome and is having a great time.

If you're needing a snack before drinking, the kitchen is open 4pm until late. On Tuesday nights, my favorite, there are Smash Bros. tourneys--free of charge--and you can win bar tabs and gift cards! Definitely follow The Phoenix Bar on FB to see all the upcoming events!

Overall, still a 5/5 star rating. I'll always come here first unless my friends are dragging me elsewhere. Keep up the great work!


----------
(Original review below, posted fall 2015)

I recently moved to Vegas from a small town in South Carolina. I had heard about Phoenix being very gamer-friendly, so I went one afternoon and didn't have a great experience. Turns out, it was just bad timing on my part and a slight miscommunication with the staff!

Since I've settled in my new apartment, I quickly learned that Phoenix is THE BEST gay bar in town. This is the consensus from both visitors and the locals! Drinks here are extremely reasonably priced (in other words, cheap!) and unlike certain other bars in town, they WILL accept credit and debit cards to keep your tab open. Yes, I've been to certain places here that were strictly cash only... Dislike.

I highly recommend coming on a Tuesday evening (after 7PM). The LV Gaymer group is really welcoming of new faces, and they love playing Super Smash Bros. (Wii U) on the projector screen--which obviously means they have good taste! This is a fun place for easy Streetpassing, and as a side note, the staff here work very closely with the LV Gaymer group. More and more events are held here at the Phoenix and I only see them both growing at this rate!

Be sure to follow and like their page on Facebook! They're actively posting with updates and events so you will know when are the best times to stop by!"}
{"text":"One fantastic spot!
Great food, awesome happy hour, and wonderful crowd!! 
Not to mention SUPER SMASH BROS. tournaments!! 
A welcome safe place for all.
I came in during a car wash and had a wonderful day out of my experience, stayed for two-for-one drinks, taco naugts, and video games!"}
{"text":"The Phoenix is quickly becoming one of my favorite bars in Vegas. I've come here for several advertised events and a few times just to hang out, and I always have a great time. They seem to embrace many different subcultures and attract a diverse and creative clientele. They have a good selection of drinks and the prices are decent. You can play video games with your friends on a huge screen. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I wish I lived in a more convenient location to call this my home bar! The Phoenix is my go-to place to go for karaoke and LGBTQ+ events. They've got karaoke twice a week, drag nights, Ladies nights, and Funderwear night--not to mention a crack bar team and a tasty menu! The atmosphere in this place is always so friendly, and you show up for a good flirt and not have to worry about getting creeped on by the gender you weren't targeting, if you know what I mean.

Another major aspect of this place for me, is the totally Safe vibe I get here. I've had my drinks roofied before in other places so I can get a little paranoid, especially if I'm somewhere alone. But I don't have that problem here! Time and time again, this bar, its staff, and its patrons have shown me that this is somewhere I can let my guard down, even if it's only to get a dance in.

Thank you, Phoenix, for existing just as you are! Hopefully someday I can live a little closer."}
{"text":"Great service. I will be Coming back, especially for brunch! I was so hammered that I don't remember lol"}
{"text":"Wow. For a gay bar, the beer selection is awesome. I'm not forced to choose between Bud Light, Blue Moon and Stella. I'm actually drinking a beer I've never had before. I was already sold on the Burner/alternative vibe, but the suds on offer a) are worth enduring the awful Britney drivel the DJ is playing and b) compels me to award five stars. Great reinvention of this formerly sucky bar. (Why couldn't it have happened when I actually lived four blocks away?)"}
{"text":"awsome! great music, good prices, average rum around 6 dollars, and whisky 7 bucks. Also they have karaoke on Sunday and Thursday!"}
{"text":"The owners, management, and staff at this bar are all very great people. This drink prices are competitive and the food is consistently good. I've yet to have a bad experience at this bar."}
{"text":"Such a low key and very cool place. My friends and I went here while in Vegas for a wedding. The drinks were good and so was the food. Music was on point and the atmosphere was chill. We had a blast."}
{"text":"I'm not gay, but I'll be the first to admit that I'm the WORST kind of fag hag. You know, the kind that's endearing to some, annoying to all others?  I can't help it; I identify with gay culture and am obsessed with wigs, platform shoes, looking good and not reproducing. Ain't got time for kids; I'd rather spend my money on FUN....like this bar!

I also happen to be a Burning Man habitué, and this cozy neighborhood gay bar also happens to be Burner-friendly (they host a lot of Burning Man-friendly events). So I feel doubly comfortable here!

Very reasonably-priced drinks, great food, al fresco patio and roomy interior, with lots of theme parties and karaoke nights. Plenty of parking, and as a bonus it's right in that part of West Sahara Ave. where all the fabulous stripper stores are. So now I can get a pair of 9\" stilettos AND a Campari-soda...all without having to re-park my truck.

Truck?! Maybe I *am* gay, after all....."}
{"text":"Bar is ok. Some older guys, some queens. But the music is heavy metal no change up or mix of any kind. Not everybody likes heavy metal. If music could be a mix, it would be a fair bar. But
nah, I'm over this place!"}
{"text":"A friend and I went into the beautifully painted (Outside)bar for happy hour on Thursday, February 13,2014 at 4:00 p.m. Our bartender was Roland. We were VERY disappointed as this bartender was only interested in two patrons sitting at the front of the bar. He sat on a stool and conversed ONLY with them. We continually had to call him over to get another drink. :-( There were 8 people in this bar and no one there was under 39 give or take a few years, and Roland completely controlled the music, we had to listen to Fat Joe, 50 cent, and every ghetto rapper he chose to put on. Well, we are not prudes far from it......However, we needless to say left only after 2 drinks and we won't be going to happy there anymore, we went down to the Spotlight, where the bartenders are friendly, especially Roland and the patrons control the music."}
{"text":"This place is a FUN time guaranteed! So cheap for drinks and food! If anything what will surprise you is the food! We got tacos and grill cheese with tomato soup!"}
{"text":"Awesome place for lots of fun!
You can gamble, you can play Nintendo or pool or you can can even order food!! 
Don't be afraid to order food from the kitchen! 
The food is soooo good!!
Lots of items to choose from, they even have Poutin!! Lol
Great drinks specials
RYAN is one of the chefs there and he is so sweet and makes great food.
Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"Thank you Ms. Shonna for your exceptional work; your bright attitude and exceptional customer service made my visit absolute perfection. Your chili cheese fries were out of this world. Thanks again for a night well spent at Phoenix! :)"}
{"text":"Dated interior and machines. I don't know who is talking about cheap drinks? Compared to the strip, yes. For a locals bar? Nothing fantastic. However, they typically will let you buy up on 2-for-1 happy hour drinks before the cutoff if you get there early. 

The local clientele is fairly low-rent. Many regulars that can be gruff to meet initially, but may warm up later, maybe. 

Some of the bartenders are friendly, and some of them not-so-much, especially if they don't feel that you've tipped them according to their expectations. Bartenders bring a lot of their friends in here so don't expect a warm welcome if you are not part of their clique. 

The section of town is so-so. Some of the worst neighborhoods in LV are right near here, but some of them are not so bad. 

Food is decent, but not really in-line with the finances of the local clientele. Thumbs up on the taconauts. 

Have had some unnecessarily rude interactions with the KJ over issues(feedback) that was not my fault. If it rains or the humidity gets high, the AC leaks onto the stage right near mic. 

Some bartenders may skip jukebox songs that you paid for that they don't happen to like. The music, particularly the sub, has been cranked up way to high on multiple occasions. 

I have never felt that the bar was particularly smokey, although this does seem to be a common complaint. They do run fans and smoke eaters and AC. This is definitely a smokers' bar - be prepared for this if you plan to go.

It is hard to tell from the outside that this place is open(particularly during the day), but it is open 24/7. If the door is locked, ring the bell."}
{"text":"I visited this bar with my boyfriend when we were in town and it's probably one of the best bars I've ever been to. 

The staff was super friendly and they had video games on the side!! Who doesn't enjoy playing video games while having some drinks?!"}
{"text":"My fave gay bar in town. Why? 

It's just the right amount of fun in there. Not super crowded to where bodies are touching and not too loud to where you have to yell when talking to someone. Maybe I'm just getting old. Hah! Drag shows are pretty legit too! The fun ones usually happen here!

The bartenders are all pretty cool, and tend the bar pretty well. There was some sass a couple times while we were there, but it was whatever. 

There's food there btw, and I suggest getting those chicken wings!! SO GOOD! I was surprised how delicious they were. Won't be disappointed. 

There's a lot of space to sit at, a small dance floor, a pool table, darts, outside lounge area, beer pong table and best of all, a projector that's connected to a WII U so you can play Smash Bros and Mario Kart!! Uhn! Is it bad we go there just for that? 

Come here and enjoy yourselves! Straight, gay and others."}
{"text":"Went for brunch, left hungry & buzzed. The food is possibly delicious, but the place is in need of serious cleaning and remodel. The kitchen is visible and looks clean, but it's the other areas that make me question the sanitation. 

The staff is great, the drinks were well poured and reasonable. We arrived a bit early on brunch Sunday, there were only three people and not much of a show. However, the staff kept us entertained and played requested music. 

I would return for karaoke, not brunch."}
{"text":"One of my favorite home bars. They treat you like family here. A lot of events and it's always pretty packed. The food is great too."}
{"text":"Good food, affordable drinks, cool atmosphere. Will definitely be back to check out a night when they are a bit busier."}
{"text":"Affordable drinks, great entertainment, and delicious food. What more can you ask for in a bar? This is one of my favorite bars in town! I prefer to come on weekdays because it's a little less packed and there's always something fun going on! If you're looking to party though, the weekend is perfect! Broadway brunch is my favorite on Sunday too. Everyone is welcoming and it feels like family."}
{"text":"I love this place. The owners, the bar staff, the kitchen: they're all great. I've never had a bad experience the countless times I've been to this bar. It's a gem. Just go. Make new friends, dance the night away, watch a show, all the above."}
{"text":"Amazing place to hang out and get away from the crazy tourist traps. Karaoke night was so fun and entertaining . But the best of all was the grilled cheese sandwich! Melt in your mouth and happy your belly"}
{"text":"Having lived in Las Vegas for 11 years and in New York  for 3, i can say with confidence that Phoenix is one of the best bars I have ever been to. I came into town for a wedding and wanted to have a drink at a gay bar. We were originally going to head to Piranhas (another gem), but decided to try something new. I was pleasantly surprised with the fun atmosphere, fresh ambiance, and ample space to sit or stand. From cheap drink and food options, to attractive dancers and great music, the Phoenix offers a little something for everyone. 

Most recently I was there for a viewing party for RuPauls Drag Race. They had plenty of screens for the show, spaces for seating, and a drag queen for commentary. The drinks were priced fairly ($7 for a Long Island) and were generous in size. I would definitely recommend this place to others and plan on visiting again when I am back in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"This has quickly has become my favorite gay bar in the city. 

I have been frequenting Funhog Ranch for over 10 years, and seriously like that place, but Phoenix seems like the bar was made specifically for me!

My friend and I went 11/11/2017 (Saturday morning) after my car broke down the street. 

We got there around 8 O'clock in the morning because the mechanic was just a block away. 

We were greeted by Estefano as a bartender. He was incredibly friendly! Seriously, the nicest, most friendly bartender I have ever had at any bar, period. 

Since the bar was empty, Estefano sat next to my friend and I while we played pool, and talked to us about his life, the bar, the events at the bar, and many other things. It was really nice of him to do that for us, and it was definitely appreciated. 

I think the drinks are fairly priced. Many people complain that the bar's drinks are a little at the pricey side, but I think they're priced just right. People, you have to keep in mind that this bar has invested lots of capital not just in the bar, but also in the games, atmosphere, and all the events they have DAILY. (There are events going on EVERY SINGLE DAY of the week!) The bar has a couple of pool tables, a dart board, and a giant projector screen with games for Wii, PlayStation, and Xbox. On top of that, they have fantastic graffiti inside and outside of the bar. For the atmosphere, and all the extra things they offer, I think the drinks prices are perfect. 

My friend and I ended up playing Marvel VS Streetfighter for around 8 hours. We were there for so long, Estefano left his shift, and met a new bartender. (I think his name was Shane?) Sean was an excellent bartender as well, not as extroverted as Estefano, but was incredibly sweet and thoughtful. He kept coming to our table by the projector screen to ask us if we wanted any more drinks whenever the place wasn't busy. 

The atmosphere. Well, this is what I loved about this place. I'm gay myself,  but the friend that I was with isn't. The crowd is a very diverse crowd of races, genders, and sexual preferences. He met a few cool girls and myself a few cool guys. The clientele was equally friendly. 

We ended up staying here aaaaaall Saturday long. From 8am to around 11pm that night. And now we go everyday. (We're huge nerds and love the video games and table games they have.) 

Phoenix, excellent job at hiring great people. Other people have mentioned that the bar and bartenders are \"cliquey\" but I personally never experienced that. They were super friendly! At the end of the night we had about 15 people surrounding us playing games with us, including some of the staff. 

Phoenix, please don't change!"}
{"text":"this was the last stop during our vegas trip and it didn't disappoint. happy hour is buy one get one free...you can't beat that and Reagan is the shit!"}
{"text":"This 1 star rating is based on the food and nothing else. I ordered carne asada nachos and after a few moments they are brought out. I take a bite and the nachos are cold. I take them to the kitchen and ask for new nachos because the ones given to me were cold. The cook, instead of apologizing, asks me \"what part was cold?\" Like I was going to reply back, \"the sour cream.\" 

I told him, \"the cheese and the meat.\" 
  
He reluctantly agreed, st\"well that's strange because I brought them out as soon as they came off the grill.\" Please tell me who puts nacho cheese sauce on the grill. If anything, that should have been the hottest on the plate. 

I walked off and I happen to see him toss the nachos angrily into the trash. At that point I decided to just get the nachos refunded since that was his attitude and never once thought that maybe the nachos were cold. I expected more."}
{"text":"Been coming here for trivia night on Tuesdays, and it's always great!  Nice ambience (blacklight responsive paintings) Good (and cheap!) drinks!  Happy hour = two for one special on drinks.  My favorites are the any of the moscow mules (inc strawberry mule) any of the daiqairies, and they even have not your father's rootbeer float!  Also great are the 9th island pizza and summer salad."}
{"text":"Literally just had the weakest poured drink of my life! I've never complained at a bar but I watched him pour our drinks and it was no alcohol being poured it was like two drops! I couldn't believe it! I had to ask another bartender to re pour a simple whiskey drink! This was a first for me but I was not about to pay 15$ for just soda!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this bar. I am a straight female but I really enjoy the atmosphere here. First of all, it catches your eye from the street with is beautiful artwork stretching from the back all the way to the front of the building. Then when you walk inside, the lighting is wonderful! Custom made light fixtures really jazz the place up. They have a projector screen with drink specials, movies, or to play wii! The food is absolutely amazing! Get the TACO NAUTS! I'm usually not a fan of any food that comes from the sea, but I will come here just for these! The rest of the menu is great too. Very unique food, shows a lot of time and dedication to the menu. I like the jalapeño ranch for my fries (which there are a lot to choose from). 

The Phoenix will also have special themed nights which are always worth going too. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is a LGBT/alt bar.  Meaning they welcome everyone!  Our local Burning Man crew meets here weekly for a happy hour(s) hangout.  Love the owners and now their kitchen is open!! Great food cooked by Gary and his crew. Do yourself a favor and try the Taco Nauts but all the dishes I've tried are delicious.  The mural on the building rocks.  They have fun events all week long. You can play Wii on a big screen with your friends, beer pong and pool are there as well.  The juke box takes your picture! The bartenders could use some urgency during service but that is my only critique. Stop in for a good time and wonderful food!"}
{"text":"Fabulous all around! Friendly service and clientele. Lose this place, I'll be back tomorrow"}
{"text":"Cool spot, with a nice little dance floor for those who want to get jiggy with it for a bit. There was an amazing special around New Years, where they were giving out wristbands for $10 for AYCD until midnight. I was here for a few hours just hanging out, and, if you're not a fan of smoky environments, you would absolutely hate this place. I'm not sure if its the lack of air ventilation, but it was by far one of the smokiest bars that I've been to in town. 

A great place to come with small group of friends to chit chat. There were some dancers, but I wasn't paying too much attention. I would come back since it's one of the few bars that actually has a dance floor."}
{"text":"So, do you wanna have a good time? or do you wanna have a really good time???
Those are the only two options here at the Phoenix where drinks are cheap, activities are everywhere and food is delicious. Whats awesome about the Phoenix is that even though its a gay bar, a straight guy like me can go and enjoy because they are inclusive of everyone, which is not something I can say for all gay bars believe it or not. This place has existed for years, but I never even considered it until the new owner took over. They repainted with some sick art that catches your attention when you're driving bar. They host a lot of special events and whatnot here, so anytime you come in, you see anything from karaoke to car washes, to everything in between. The drinks are more than reasonably priced, the bartenders make sure your cup is always where it needs to be, and last but not least, they have SUPER SMASH BROS!!!!!!!! I didn't realize it until i came here, but drinking on a couch and playing Mario Kart with my friends is quite possibly a pastime that every needs to adopt. They recently added a kitchen, and I can get all culinary on you but ill say this: open your mouth, put a taco-naut in there, cha it, swallow it, then profess your undying gratitude.
Overall, this place has an incredibly authentic vibe. Its always buzzing, and unlike almost every other bar in town, I've never met any belligerent, drunk idiots here. The patrons to the bartenders, to the owner, everyone is always in a good mood here. I've never had a bar that i call \"my bar\" but this is about as close as any bar will get to that status."}
{"text":"This place has an awesome vibe. Brett Rubin's B-day bash this Sat nite after 11, with Brett spinning! A must attend... Brett is the best in LV for deep House & TechHouse.

Plus the grill is open, and Lando and Gabe promise an awesome experience. You've been warned; miss this one and you'll kick yourself! He spins at DISTRIKT."}
