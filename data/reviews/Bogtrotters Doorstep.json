{"text":"This place is great!  Parking can be had in the lot just past the building on Bridge or across the street in Dave's lot (be quick).  Seating is non-existent, though others have said you can sit in The Angle.  

Choices are limited here, but what great choices there are!  The menu is limited to a handful of sandwiches, all with house made ingredients and they have a Coke fountain.  The sandwiches truly do not require a side of chips or anything.  What the sandwiches do require is a knife, fork, and a handful of napkins.

Do yourself a favor and get the crunch (potato chips, which add some texture and salt) and get your sandwich dunked.  My first trip there, I just got the sandwich wet and it was a challenge to cut through the crusty bread.  On my second trip, having it soaked worked beautifully even with a 15 minute trip back to the office before I dug in.

I got the eponymous sandwich (The Bogtrotter) on my first trip and it is a great place to start.  The Chicago Combo was also delicious, but the cheese sauce is to die for!"}
{"text":"If I can be honest - I was left totally disappointed yesterday. The hours online said open at noon, the window at the shop stated the same. Two coworkers and myself traveled 8.5 miles from nearby Lakewood, specifically for a tasty Bogtrotters sandwich, only to be denied at the glass like Andre Igoudala vs LeBron 12 months ago in game 7. We arrived punctually at 12:02 PM EST, 2 minutes after the shop \"opens\". When we arrived the door was locked and the shop was darker than the soul of Mitch McConnell. We opted to give the benefit of the doubt and wait 10 minutes. We thought we were in luck when the lights flicked on and a trendy young bearded fellow strolled into make our dreams come true - only to be shit on again like a pigeon in NYC. We knocked on the glass multiple times and the man saw us but would not acknowledge and quickly vanished into the depths of the kitchen where tasty meat morsels are created for taste bud pleasure (just not ours on 6/22/17). We ended up at Ohio city burrito and over to Mitchell's for a scoop - not the worst audible but not what we drove on our short lunch break for. 

These are some of the best sandwiches in town, but on this day we were left high n dry with no rope or water for rescue."}
{"text":"I can not stop eating here. So simple, yet so amazing. \"The Cleveland\" (sandwich) is why God made turkeys. There is no greater purpose a turkey can hope to achieve."}
{"text":"We got 3 Chicagos & 1 Turkey sandwich for lunch. The bread was fantastic, the meats were tender, the cheese was tasty & the au jus was perfect. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The sandwich was tasty. I must say I found the turkey a bit dry - but maybe it's because I got the jus on the side and added it later. The bread is delicious - something that is a necessity in any great sandwich. But, IMO I would rank Jimmy John's french bread tastier. 

The biggest problem I have with BD is the prices. For $9 I could go to Melt and buy a Smokey Russian for the same price and still have leftovers for the next day. Or if I wanted something less heavy, I could go to Subway and get a foot long sub for nearly half the price. 

Places usually get away with charging higher prices for food because they have a certain vibe, seating, free wi-fi, etc. (ie: Phoenix Coffee, Starbucks, etc). Or their food is so superior and unique that price doesn't matter. Last I checked, BD's permanent seating options consisted of 2 stools in the corner  - or going into the Old Angle Tavern (which has its own tasty lunch menu btw). 

BD has made a good attempt, but they need to lower their prices by about $2."}
{"text":"I ordered the clev crunch wet...first time there. I kid you not, I'm not sure if it was the meat or sauce but the sandwich smelled like cleaning products. Come to find the turkey tasted like it too. I took it to-go and joined 2 friends and had them taste the turkey without saying anything and they agreed it was \"off\" and left a bad after taste."}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches! I order the Haight, soaked, with chips."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The bread is fresh (from On The Rise), the meat is juicy and tasty, and the sandwiches are huge.  I highly recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in Bogtrotters, especially because I work right around the corner and this would be the perfect lunch place.  Based upon my first impression, I will never return.

I ordered the turkey, wet, no crunch.  The sandwich was very salty, (I was so glad I didn't get the crunch!) and extremely messy.  I will say that I eat heart-healthy/never add salt to my food, so there is a sensitivity there, but it doesn't change the fact that this sandwich was barely edible for me.  I was particularly irritated when I asked the lady who made my sandwich if she could cut it in half for me and she said \"we don't do that here\" and referred me to the plastic knifes they have available next to the forks and napkins.  Yeah... cutting that thick/tough sandwich in half with plastic utensils was pretty ridiculous; it was a job suited for a steak knife and there I was going at it with a plastic knife, bending the plastic and shredding apart my sandwich rather than getting a clean cut.  Then as the au jus soaked into the cardboard container that the sandwich was in, the cardboard became soft and about the same consistency as the bread, and I began accidentally cutting up the cardboard with the sandwich and eating bits of it. 

Also, plan on eating with a fork unless you have a huge mouth and are very talented at not making a mess.  I didn't bother trying to pick my sandwich up, but that was partially because of the above-mentioned issues I had cutting the sandwich in half.  '

Go next door to Old Angle for food instead.  They are owned by the same people and the food is way better and similar price."}
{"text":"the sandwiches are nice and thick with lots of meat thats for sure. i guess they should be if your going to charge $9.00 per. i have only ordered the cheese steak, but the meat, cheese onions and everything were very tasty. the reason i didn't give a higher rating is because the bread is very tough. kind of like if you heated a sandwich in the microvave and the bread feels really dense... anyway, i wish they used a better roll. 
the customer service from the woman at counter is always excellent."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are a bit pricey but you definitely get what you pay for. Mountain of meat that was absolutely scrumptious. No seating area unless you want to go sit in the adjacent bar."}
{"text":"Bogtrotters is so great. A true Cleveland original!"}
{"text":"I have to say my experience at Bogtrotters was very sub par.  For a few months I have been hearing about how good this sandwich shop was.  Friday night I was in the area and decided to give it a shot.  What disappointment.  First off, I can see how the sandwich could be good and hope I was there on a bad night.  I got it crunchy wet which means Aujus and Potato chips on top.  The bread was rock hard.  The meat was so dry I could hardly even eat the sandwich.  The two people in my car also tried it.  What was really sad is they were drunk and still thought it was pretty average.  I'm not going to continue on as I love local businesses.  The meat had to have been sitting out for hours.  For the price I will go elsewhere next time.  What a shame."}
{"text":"The owner of this place told my friends and I to \"Shut the f**K up\" after we each paid 9.00 for a sandwich with dry meat and stale bread. Very unprofessional."}
{"text":"We went in here on a weekend afternoon.  Ordered a philly, wet, with crunch.  I thought it was great but my bf was put off by its soggyness.  I don't think you could eat this sandwich without a knife and fork anyway, so the soggyness didn't bother me.  It was delicious and filling for two people looking for a snack.

They delivered the sandwich to us next door at the bar.  I will go back here sometime soon."}
{"text":"Bittersweet news from Bogtrotter's Doorstep, chef Nate Williams has passed the torch to the amazing staff at The Old Angle and will be moving on toward new culinary adventures. I can't wait to see what he does next...long live Bogs!!"}
{"text":"O Yelp!  4.5 stars for this?!  I have never been lead astray this badly by your reviews.  I pretty much planned my day around trying this sandwich, and it was really disappointing.  We figured we'd go for the Bogtrotter to get the full experience.  We got it soaked with crunch, and aside from the sausage and some of the chips, it all just turned into this soggy mess and I really couldn't even tell what was on the sandwich.  Marinara?  Mushrooms?  Cheese sauce?  No idea.  And it was sooooo salty.  And so sad."}
{"text":"This place is open late-night, making it a great postbar stop on the way home. 

I split their massive Philly, which comes with roasted beef, grilled onions, mushrooms, and their house cheese sauce. Finger-lickin' good. I could only hope for more of their deliciously juicy mushrooms to bump this sandwich up to perfection. We got it wet and crunch, meaning it was topped with their house jus and some potato chips-- creative, eh? Great idea to get your sandwich crunchy if you're eating there, but by the time we got back the chips were just a soggy mess. Still, for $9 you are sure to get a massive and delicious sandwich that's oozing with goodness. Don't forget to grab a mountain of napkins on your way out-- believe me, you'll need it!"}
{"text":"I love this place. 

I have been looking for sandwich places in Cleveland, OH and this one is one of the top ranked place. I like the location. 

THey have only one vegetarian option which is somewhat restricting for me, but what they have is awesome and I will not trade it for anything else. I love their sandwich. As always food is the most important of the experience for me and I will be going there whenever I crave their sandwich."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Little dive take out with out of this world sandwiches. The Philly with the cheese and crunch is making my mouth water now.   

They have all kinds of organic take out items. The staff is relaxed and friendly."}
{"text":"ADDICTING!!!! Unbelievably good. The Philly is amazing. Tons of meat, and the homemade cheese sauce has a kick of jalapeño to it. The crunchy chips on top add a nice crunchy texture. I've also had the Italian Combo. Soooo good! Who doesnt love sauce and sausage?! The fact that youre able to take it over to The Old Angle only adds to the charm of this fantastic addition to Ohio City. You will definitely be craving the sandwiches!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a little hard to find but worth it.  The Porkopolis and Cleveland are packed with meat and one has a wonderful homemade cheese sauce.  You can get them dry or wet (submerged or just a little Au Jus) with chips on top.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"Had the Philly w/crunch (lays potato chips on top) no onions.  And the au jus on the side.   Needed a little more jus, but sandwich shop well needed in W. 25th area.   

Seating is minimal / non-existent but great place to order for work that's a way better option than Subway or Jimmy John's boredom."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  Very small place. I can imaging a line out the door even if they are only slightly busy. Guy at the counter was patient and answered my questions. Ordered an Italian and a Cleveland, both crunchy and dry. My Italian was really good... and really messy. Wife wasn't a fan of the Cleveland, but I thought it was good. Only problem is they mad the Cleveland wet, which made it very hard to eat and soggy. My first choice, the Porkopolis was not available and it sounded like the best on the board. Might stop back in the future to try a different sammich..."}
{"text":"Went here because it was one of the only late night food places in Ohio City. Worst sandwich I've ever had in my life. Was recommended the Chicago and it literally tasted like spicy hell. Had a couple bites of my friends sandwich and the stiff bun fell apart immediately and ruined it. You're better off skipping a meal than trying this place."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why my Yelp reviews seem to garner praise and compliments. Some of the better ranking reviews I have given, I have found that places shut down very soon after. I gave a favorable review for an adult video store and found later in the age of digital transformation, that sparkling oasis dried forsaken.

Now Bogtrotter's is great. Aujus wet with potato chips on the side is the way I go. I have experienced inconsistencies with the subs from time to time and that is why I am holding back with four stars. I enjoy the cleveland, turkey, swiss, and onions wet and lately they have skimped on the chips. If I have this meal to go and bring sub back to my home I enjoy taking of my pants. Once my pants are off and only after I eat the sub in one sitting. warm summer night. Yay I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Had the porkopolis today for lunch. Fantastic sandwich I had it soaked and crunchy. Its the way to go. Easily one of the best sandwiches in town. Probably best in town. This is a real sandwich not that pond scum they serve at Melt."}
{"text":"4 stars for my first visit. As someone who recently became a pescetarian, I have to say I was a little jealous of the meat options!

I got the vegetarian option (The Haight) which was chock full of veggies -- mushrooms, onions, some type of greens, some sort of squash, topped with mushroom jus (wet option) and crunchy. I might get it dry next time since the veggies are already pretty wet. My bread was pretty soaked through by the time I got done.

I have to say, it probably wasn't the best vegetarian sandwich I've had before. I'm not quite sure if it's worth the $9 price tag for the sandwich. I think the jewels here are def with the meat sandwiches, and my bf enjoyed his turkey \"Cleveland\" sandwich, especially the jus.

I'm happy to hear that it's open until 3am on Fri and Sat -- amazing. This place is def a craveworthy late night munchy snack."}
{"text":"I have to say I'm suprised to read all the rave reviews cause the sandwiches my sister and I tried were some of the worst sandwiches I have ever eaten a I'm not exagerating.  It could be we caught them on a bad night? We tried the veggie which was okay but the roast beef was terrible. The meat was dry even though we got it wet and it was bland. The only seasoning you could taste was salt and way too much of it and the cheese sauce was grainy and also tasted off. The pork was also terrible. It was also dry and bland and actually tasted old. It wasn't so much sliced as it was crumbled and resembles what you see left on the slicer after you've sliced the meat. My sister and I have worked in food service for a few decades and  were very exited to hear of bogtrotters as it sounded just like what the area needed but I must say that the experience was soo bad that even it was just one bad night , I will never try them again. I wouldn't know what to do to make a sandwich that bad."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!!! Everything they serve is fresh on a daily basis and local!! I love the prime rib sandwich, wet with crunch. Thats with a little au ju and chips on top. The fresh bread is to die for and i love the homemade cheese sauce i always request extra because it is so good and i like the little kick. No where to sit unless its summer and you can grab the table outside on the sidewalk but this doesnt bother me. The sandwich is massive! You can seriously split this between 2 people. Its 9 bucks for a sandwich and totally worth it! Hell if you cut it in half you have 2 meals under 5 bucks"}
{"text":"I had a Chicago combo, which has roast beef and Italian sausage, wet with crunch (chips).

It was amazing. Good bread, tasty au jus, flavorful meats and peppers. Worth the price because I was super stuffed after."}
{"text":"I mean there really isn't much to say. It's a tiny little whole in the wall (really, it's not much larger than a literal whole in the wall) they have about 2 handfuls of sandwich options a few sides and bottled drinks. It's a little bit on the pricey side, but for the neighborhood it's about average. 

This place is best visited when dying of hunger and more or less drunk. Not because that's the only time it will taste good (because trust me the sandwiches are actually pretty tasty) but because it is not until you roll in there at 3am after complaining to your friends for 30 minutes that you're just SO HUNGRY, so much so that they are all now drunk and hungry too, that you will fully appreciate and understand why this place is great. Because let me tell you, you're going to be one of 6 groups of SO HUNGRY, SO DRUNK people there. You'll meet interesting people, hear interesting conversations, maybe meet some not so interesting people who are drunk and trying to hit on your group of friends. Regardless, you are gonna get a really good sandwich and immediately be transported back to what ever greasy spoon/late night eatery you frequented in college when drunk and and searching to fill your bottomless booze-filled stomach, just on a smaller scale with (probably) better food.

Oh yeah, get the Philly, it's not traditional but it's damn delicious."}
{"text":"First time eating here, definitely won't be the last. Great service and super clean. We didn't realize how small the place was, and that it was basically a take out joint. The guy informed us that we could have a drink next door and when we figured out what we wanted he would bring it right over! Talk about service.  The bar was a great place to get out of the cold, eat a yummy lunch, and enjoy an afternoon together."}
{"text":"How can I not give 5 stars to a place that gave me a Philly-Steak the size of a 747 for $9? 

 The gentleman working the counter was nice and even delivered our sandwich to the adjacent bar. Now that's what I call customer service. 

 This behemoth of a sandwich was messy, gooey and loaded with meaty flavor. It was one of the better sandwiches I've eaten. The next time I'm in Cleveland, I'm definitely stopping back."}
{"text":"Jesus Christ,

Thank you for making the world a cool place and telling your pa to arrange the cosmos so that the exact right time/place/person would align and form the Bogtrotters Doorstop.

BECAUSE THE CLEVELAND IS THE BEST FREAKING SANDWICH I HAVE EVER HAD. HOLY SHEEP IS IT FANTASTIC. 

Amen.

I got it dry, and Nate hit me with a side of the jus...after the sandwich was eaten (I didn't put it down for one second) I drank the jus like a shot. WOW. BonBon my ass. $40 breakfast is one thing, the BEST SANDWICHES in the United States are entirely another. This is the best new place in the O.C.

Matt has his dreams of Milk Bar, I have my dreams of a PB+J place, but Nate went ahead and created a monster of his own. you can BET YOUR FREAKING ASS that this joint is going to be huge."}
{"text":"Thanks to my fellow yelpers I decided to finally check this place out. I got the philly steak wet without crunch. Two words: YUM-O! (Yes the O counts as a second word). This sandwhich was pure awesomeness in my mouth. The cheese sauce you could tell was home made and not some garbage out of a can. The owner/ server guy was super nice. Can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Open. That's what they are at 3am when you just got shown the door at everywhere else in the OC. Unless it is Monday and then they are closed.

These good people will make you a sandwich that will have you working it off just by carrying it to your car. Seriously. It should come with a wagon.

I get the Bogtrotter almost every time. When I get home, I wonder what I was thinking. The regular sandwiches are already big and then the Bogtrotter is just a beast.

I think the location on a side street instead of W 25th and the lack of a line out the door might hurt them a bit. There's nothing wrong with that for you. You just need to know the secret location.

You can even call your order in ahead. If you do, there's an extra \"no parking\" space in front of the door. Since you'll be in and out in 30 seconds, the odds of a ticket are pretty slim."}
{"text":"Second attempt to dine here was tonight Weds, at 9:20pm. 
Unfortuantely it was the second time they were closed when they were supposed to be open (at least according to their facebook and yelp pages). 

Two other gentlemen walking up behind me were also disappointed when they saw me attempt to open the door. 

Definitely won't be giving them a third attempt."}
{"text":"Steak sandwich is very good. Chicken wrap is delicious as well. Portions are HUGE! Be prepared to share this meal or take home leftovers. Yum yum!"}
{"text":"Once again, partially biased by the fact that I've lived above (and basically in) the Old Angle Tavern, and because Nate has never had a chance to do his own thing, but these sandwiches warrant a 5 star rating.

So many shops try to pull off this type of sandwich and simply can't do it, mostly because they're corporate and have their processed food shipped across the country. Nate Williams, formerly head chef of the Flying Fig, is brining and roasting his own turkey, pork and beef and serving one of the most delicious things I've ever put in my mouth. The turkey is so moist that it melts in your mouth. The homemade cheese sauce would be good on anything. They're open for lunch during the week and serve till 3 am on weekends. We've had no late take-out food available in Ohio City until now, which is ridiculous considering it's one of the booziest streets in the state. I can't say enough and I won't stop telling people how good these sandwiches are. Well done, doctor."}
{"text":"These sandwiches are probably the most delicious thing anyone could possibly eat at 2am. If you're on W. 25th there is no reason to order food anywhere else, these sandwiches are all you will ever need."}
{"text":"After a grueling evening I drove home thru the city rather than the freeway. It had been a surprisingly cold spring day with hail and light snow after a short Carolina winter. I decided to try Bogs since it has been on my list of Highly Rated by Yelpsters.

The man at the counter was polite and efficient. I happily carried home my turkey sandwich with the au jus on the side. Eating it took me back decades to when the entire family went to the corner bar to cash paychecks, play the bowling game, watch television, and eat wet sandwiches. Bogs' sandwich was dressed a bit more but similar in taste not in price.

Unlike others I did not find the sandwich to be of huge proportions. The price is the same as an entire dinner at many mom and pop eateries. It was a good sandwich but not as great as all of Ohio City seems to think. I suspect I will try another sandwich before the next time it hails."}
{"text":"Ummm--just to be clear, their turkey sandwich is also effing amazeballs. 

I got that guy with some of their homemade cheese sauce and crumbled chips on top, oh hells yea. 

Moist turkey, chewy bread, cheesy goodness--what more could you ask for at 1:30am? I'm pretty sure nothing else. 

I would advise getting this one dry with the au jus on the side. But then again, it's totally a matter of taste. 

Either way, I love this place."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum!  This place is in a real cool part of Cleveland thats is popping on a Friday night. I ordered the Cleveland.  So delicious.  The turkey you tell has been soaking in au jus sauce cause it was so moist and flavorful!  Yet the bread was not soggy, still crispy and light.  Totally recommended and great for late night food!"}
{"text":"Thank you fellow Yelpers for leading me to this amazing sandwich shop, which is open until 3am? Get out! 

Before I go into the detail of just how truly amazing this sandwich is - please note that it is not on West 25th. It's actually on Bridge. Please don't give up when trying to find it, because it is very much worth it.  Look for the Bogtrotters sign hanging from the side of Old Angle, and let the food games begin!

I went the the classic - the Clevelander - and it is an amazing sandwich.  The roasted turkey is so moist, and smothered in delicious cheese and au jus that rivals my any au jus I've experienced.  The grilled onions are soft, slightly sweet, and just perfect to finish off an amazing sandwich. 

BUT - I had to ask for more ...  

I read about the cheese sauce, and asked for some of that on the side.  I added it to a few bites, and it just took the sandwich to another level of amazing!  

Tips: 
1) They are HUGE - you will take half home. 
2) If you aren't planning to eat it all, or eat in - get the au jus on the side.  It tends to make the sandwich soggy - quickly.  It's delicious while you're eating it, but I wouldn't want to start out with a less than perfect sandwich.  
3) Get the Crunch on the side if you're not eating in - again for the soggy issue. 
4) GOOOOOO NOW!"}
{"text":"Great sandwich.  I ordered the turkey which was great!  Limited menu, but all I need is the turkey and I'm good to go!"}
{"text":"Huge, satisfying sandwiches filled with quality ingredients.  I love a place that has a simple menu and does everything perfectly.  I love everything about this joint.  I don't eat meat, but I make an exception for Bogtrotters because it is that good. 

Word to the wise.....crunchy means chips put on the sandwich......personally I feel this is a fabulous choice.  And you won't miss out on the au jus by getting the sandwich 'dry.'  They give you a generous enough portion to take home.  

I'm not one for eating light and I usually find myself eating enough for two.  But one of these sandwiches totally does the trick for me."}
{"text":"Here is my review....I got the Bogtrotter to go and I was halfway through eating it with a knife and fork I realized I was eating the paper sandwich holder thing. The sandwich was so damn good I was eating paper and I didn't care"}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches, driven many times from Lakewood \"just for subs\". These are chef created, far superior than any competition.  Turkey tastes like the best leftover home sandwich you've ever created, any day of the year. The au jus is incredible!"}
{"text":"Good sandwich, friendly staff, and a lot of toppings. I like the cheese whiz. I feel it was missing something to be 4 stars."}
{"text":"After reading the yelp reviews I couldn't wait to try this place. I went with my gf I got the Philly(wet no crunch) she got the clevelander(dry with crunch). The portions were huge and the bread was good however the meat was extremely dry. Overall a so so sandwich and I won't try again. I'm assuming most of those 5 star reviews came after a long night of drinking because this place just isn't that good."}
{"text":"Wet. With crunch.

That is a term that will get you a weird look, but at Bogtrotter's it gets you deliciousness. Wet means that the au jus has been lovingly poured over the juicy hunks of house-roasted meats. Crunch means chips on top. Get in my belleh!  Well, you know what that means.

Everything else has been covered by my fellow Yelpers, including the handy option of eating your sammie in Old Angle. Although I really wish I could take my sammie in to ABC Tavern (no offense OA) because I think their house made potato chips and caramelized onion dip would be amazing with the sandwich craft from the Bog. But that's another review..."}
{"text":"Good baby Jesus, the best sammies, and you can freely enjoy them while drinking at The Ole Angle.  Try the Clevelander, you WILL thank me!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, and you take em next door to eat in a bar (same owner). Thumbs up."}
{"text":"This place is a gem in Ohio City! I know what you're thinking...ANOTHER sandwich shop? Not at all! Bogtrotters Doorstep is delicious. I found this place after two other Ohio City restaurants had insane waits. 

I stumbled upon this place on a happy accident. You can literally pass this place on the street and never know its there, because its that tiny. The food was awesome, inexpensive, and fast. I recommend getting the Italian, wet, with crunch-- wet refers to their house sauce, and crunch refers to chips on the sandwich. I know it sounds crazy, but its one of the best sandwiches in Ohio City."}
{"text":"\"Ah jus\", \"with crunch\". Two phrases the English use about 95% more than the Americans do. Or the French, or the Irish or the wherever those people are from that came up with those terms. I did a google search for \"sandwich au jus with crunch\" and the page you're on right now was the fifth suggestion. That means that the Bogtrotter's Doorstep is indeed special.

\"The Cleveland\" soaked with crunch is what they gave me. It had chicken, it had onions, it had cheese and it was soaked in au jus. And in case you're still scratching your head, \"au jus is a French culinary term meaning \"with juice\". It refers to meat dishes prepared or served together with a light gravy made from the juices given off by the meat as it is cooked.\" (With credits to Wikipedia.) And it had crunch- potato chips on top. Tasty. 

My least favorite part was the fact that you have to eat your meal in the adjoining tavern. Which really was not much of a problem. And one last thing, I would eat here just to tell people that I'd eaten at the Bogtrotter's Doorstep. Best name you would have never come up with on your own."}
{"text":"The sandwiches here are darn good.  They are also very large so come hungry.  Delicious, not greasy.  I prefer mine wet, with crunch (+ potato chips on top).  The first time I went here I got the sandwich dry, because... aren't sandwiches usually dry?  Well, dry is way too dry.  Really, the jus is what makes these sandwiches succulent and delicious, and it's a must.

A good number of their ingredients are pretty spicy, which was a bit of an issue for us because of our low spice tolerances.  But any sorts of substitutions are allowed, and they were very patient with all of our questions, haha.

One time we went there at 7 pm on a Wednesday and they... ran out of food??  Got there just as they were putting up the notice on their door.  That was a very sad, sandwichless night."}
{"text":"I visited this place after beer tasting at some of the local breweries in Ohio City. You can easily walk by and miss this place. The menu is sandwiches only. However, each sandwich is very intricate and delicious. It gives you the option of either a wet \"Au Jus\" or a dry \"i.e. no Au Jus\" sandwich. The option of adding a crunch on top, which are kettle cooked chips [hello so yummy]. The lady that worked there recommended the wet Italian with some crunch on top. 
The sandwiches are all about 9$ - definitely not ideal but at least the sub was huge. There were only 3 small tables to sit at outside and only a bar seat that fits two inside. Luckily, it was a beautiful Ohio day :) and a perfect end to our beer tour!"}
{"text":"I think the raves are mostly deserved. Next time I'm jonesing for a great sandwich, this'll be high on my list of options. So far, I've tried the turkey and the pork. Yeah, it's a bit pricey, but the servings are huge. I don't recommend the \"crunch\" to go unless you like soggy potato chips. The jus was tasty on both sandwiches I tried. Looking forward to trying more sandwiches and maybe justifying a bump up to five stars."}
{"text":"So. Was the Chicago sandwich the best Italian beef I've had outside of Chicago? Yes, yes it was. The beef was perfect, the roll was just chewy enough, and the sweet peppers were outstanding. While a \"Hot Beef\" option (with spicy giardiniera) would be nice, this was as good as it gets. The pork loin sandwich, though, was better than the \"Chicago\", with juicy pork and excellent spicy greens. The fact that it's open late is...icing on the cake? Jus on the sandwich, maybe. I will say that the crumbled potato chips that they offer are usually unnecessary, but they don't come standard so it shouldn't be an issue. If you're in the area, and you want a good (but messy!) hot sandwich, you can't do better than here."}
{"text":"I went here Saturday around 1 am sober believe it or not.  I didn't realize there was a counter inside Old Angel that you could order from but I ordered from the little restaurant.  Its really tiny but has a few tables and chairs.  I got the Clevelander which was $9 and I wasn't that impressed.  The meat was too dry and the bread was soggy.  I didn't specify if I wanted it wet or dry, so I think thats my fault.  My friend got the Philly that looked amazing.  I would try to go here again because I want to try a sandwhich with crunch, which means chips on top.  The bread was so good so I think I'll be back to give it another shot."}
{"text":"Now THIS is my kind of sandwich shop.  

Also, you would think that a place that puts chips on their sandwiches might not be made with quality ingredients but you would be dead wrong.  The beef is very peppery, but I thought it was just outstanding.   Minimal cheese - so it just wasn't a cheesy mess. And my god the Au jus with the crunch is just so freakin' good. 

From a guy who really doesn't care for the traditional deli style sandwiches, this is as good as it gets for sandwiches for me."}
{"text":"Best ever. Tons of beef, deep mushroom flavor, salty and rich cheese sauce, total mess. Get crunch."}
{"text":"This was either not covered in the other reviews, or I totally missed it... but, you can order Bogtrotters' subs from The Old Angle bar on the corner.  Being a newbie here, I was told this by the owner/chef.

I ordered the Philly.  Even though it's called \"The Philly\" it's not a Philly Cheesesteak.  It is a roast beef sub done Philly-style...with home made cheese sauce (better than whiz), grilled onions and grilled mushrooms.  I got mine wet, crunch, and without onions..

I have to say that this was a damn-near perfect sandwich.  The roast beef was tender and seasoned perfectly.  The cheese sauce was rich and delicious.  And the bread was quality bakery bread.  And it wasn't hard or dry in the least.  I think some people are assuming the bun would be some crappy hot dog bun or soft sub bun, but its not.  Its crusty and sturdy.  And it needs to be...especially if you get your sandwich wet or soaked.

Either way, you're gonna want to have a fork & knife and plenty o' napkins because at some point, unless you can down this monstrous sandwich quickly, the jus-soaked bun is going to give out on you.

Loved the sandwich, loved the atmosphere, and the chef/owner was super nice.  I'll be back.  I just wish it wasn't so far away from where I live.

Only con - street parking sucks here."}
{"text":"Was it great ? For whatever it's worth, no, but it was very good and Bogtrotters fills a massive void in Ohio city, or anywhere in Cleveland for that matter. Why can't you get good take-out, late at night, especially after imbibing alcoholic beverages, *shakes fist like Homer Simpson * ?! 

Located behind the Old Angle in the heart of Ohio City, Bogtrotters offers sub sandwiches [take-out only] steps away from the bars of W.25th. This place is open to 3A on Friday and Saturday. 
For $9, the Philly was a solid choice. $9 for the sub isn't a great value [call cheap me for all I care, and I suppose a $1 goes for the bank card transaction], but the sub is quite large, I'm guessing 9 inches of bread. I order the Au Jus on the side and with crunch, somewhat crumbled kettle-cooked potato chips, I didn't care for the potato chip toppings but really enjoyed the mushrooms and onions. 

I really hope they succeed because there is a massive void in Ohio City, or Cleveland for late night take-out nosh [no, TB, you don't count] and I'd go there again."}
{"text":"Friendly Counter guy, very paient.  A Little pricier than I would like. but over all good place to go."}
{"text":"pork, beef or veggies
simultaneously wet
and crunchy chip joy

For a fantastic sandwich in the O.C., this is as good as it can get.  Nothing processed here.  All of the meat products are oven roasted in house, the bread is delicious and perfect for soaking up the au jus.  I have had the turkey, and most recently the beef philly.  There is a vegetarian sandwich as well. Personally, I can't eat one sandwich in a single sitting, therefore, I get to enjoy it twice.  
I like that.  
A lot.

Carry on..."}
{"text":"I just can't even with this place!  

Walked in (it's tiny, if you want to sit you go next door to the charming corner bar) and the lady who was helping me was super cool and funny.  Was going to go for the turkey sandwich (The American) but she said cheese sauce and I made up my mind on the Philly.  She was very helpful as soon as I walked in asking me what I like... \"spicy?\"  I said \"I don't like spicy, I like simple\".  This is not a sandwich to eat on the run!  Take it to the bar connected to it and take your time to enjoy it with a good beer or fancy whiskey.  Also, make sure you are hungry because it is a FEAST.  Make sure you get chips on it no matter what you choose."}
{"text":"I think this is the first time I was able to convince my wife and her parents all to get a different sandwich just so I can have leftovers.  I obviously ate every single delicious drop of mine but it turned out to be a little much for the other 3.

I went with the Porkopolis, wet, no crunch.  Delicious....I mean nothing in Cleveland like it Delicious.  The Au Jus really doesn't need to do the meat any justice because the quality of beef and pork deserves its own kudos, the Jus only adds to the perfectness of each sandwich and if you want to get technical, the Jus softens the bread to make it a little easier to eat but also slopifies it. 

As the rest of my party discussed how good the sandwiches were, I was too busy texting friends to come down and get a damn sandwich.  Even at the $9 eyesore, once you get a sandwich, you'll pay that all day, every day.

Leftovers were great, so don't feel the need to eat it in one sitting but good luck trying to resist.

We were able to order and eat in the Old Angle while we enjoyed a couple Christmas Ales.

Best sandwich was the Philly, wet, no crunch.  Crunch is crumbled chips which were good but got a little soggy after the wet and added more saltiness to something already salty enough.  Go dry with crunch and dip, that will suffice.  Great mushrooms.  Cheese rocked, didn't congeal too much.  Bread was perfect.   

Stop by on your next trip to the West Side Market.  Don't blink cause its on the side of the Old Angle where the name is nicely printed on the door."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are 5 star, without a doubt. So amazingly different and good. Ingredients are awesome - tons of meat in the sandwiches. Get the one with the beef, cheese sauce, onions, mushrooms and peppers dipped in au jus with chips. SO SO good and unlike anything you're likely to have had before. They are big. Go hungry and leave stuffed. 

I had to take a star away, though, for the service. Both times I've been to the doorstep, I've been made to feel like I'm a big inconvenience and if I would just go away, the day of the person 'helping' me would be so much better. The last time the guy (not Alex, the owner - some younger guy) was an honest-to-god douchebag. I really wanted to tell him where he could shove it. He was a smartass about everything and when they were out of the cheese sauce, he didn't even apologize, just said in a very annoyed hurry-up kind of way 'I won't have any for 45 minutes'. Oh excuse me for being bummed that the single best ingredient you have is not available. 

Awesome sandwiches, we'll definitely be back and with luck I'll be able to tack on that last star at some point in the future."}
{"text":"I can see why so many people love this little sandwich stand, but it wasn't for me. Even with interesting-sounding sandwich options, the flavor just wasn't there. The portions are huge, and I can see why it has a devoted following, but it's just not my kind of sandwich place."}
{"text":"Oh. My. Goodness. This place is fantastic!!!! Tried to stop in here for lunch one day after smelling their amazing sandwiches cooking all day but they had closed. I made a special trip back the next day and was not disappointed! I had the Cleveland wet with crunch (drizzled with au jus with chips on top) and it was out of this world good. 

To be fair, I was a little put off when I walked in and there was only counter service but you're able to eat your order in the restaurant next door (you can also order inside that restaurant). The employees were also a bit on the rude side when we asked them to explain the menu but I kind of expect that in Ohio City since it's a hipster crowd and I am decidedly un-hip. ;)

Their portions are huge and flavor is so good that I've made several trips back to this restaurant and recommended it to countless others. Give them a try!"}
{"text":"Fantastic unique sandwich. Got The Cleveland, wet, with a crunch. 

Fast and simple."}
{"text":"It is what it is. It's a late night food option that will put you to bed. No matter what you'll get, you'll get slabs of whatever meat you choose. From there you'll decide if you want your sandwich drenched in au jus or not and if you wanted it crunchy with chips or not too. Simple stuff. Wrap that bad boy up in aluminum foil and you'll be on your way."}
{"text":"I'm still chewing!!! 

I had to get on here in a hurry to lend my voice to the chorus of Yelpers who LOVE Boggtrotters Doorstep! I can't wait to try the whole menu. For my first time I got the Philly and..WOW! 

I will have to try this famous cheese sauce everyone has mentioned next time. I will be back very soon! 

Side notes: 

-Next time my boyfriend and I can split one instead of each getting our own. 
-Get sauces and Jus on the side!

YUM! Check it out right away!!"}
{"text":"Now, THAT'S a sandwich.

I like sandwiches. I hadn't really found a great sandwich place to go to- sometimes Melt is just so greasy, and nothing seems to compete with Zingermans where I spent many years.

After hearing so many good reviews from fellow yelpers, we went to Bogtrotters Doorstep tonight. Oh man, was it ever good.

First, it's kind of hard to find. \"1848 W. 25th\". Ummm. For the illiterate directionalist I am, I was rather confused when the address led me to Old Angle Tavern. I walked in and out a couple of times.... then called them. \"There's tables right outside my door\" said the voice on the other line (although he almost seemed annoyed), \"you mean the door with the dentists names outside?\" \"No, there's tables right outside\"..and then I realized it was on Bridge instead. Oops.

Walked in, found my dinner partner waiting, and Nate greeted me with a smile (ok, may he wasn't annoyed). It's a cute hole in the wall place, right off of Old Angle- in fact, it shares a spot with Old Angle, so we were able to bring our food into Old Angle, enjoy the live music there, and eat our sandwiches.

Nate actually brought us our sandwiches as we sat in Old Angle (aww, how nice!). We both ordered ours \"wet\" and \"crunchy\"- meaning, that the sandwich is dipped in au jus sauce and \"crunchy\" meaning that they put chips on it. Simple enough. He got the porkopolis- pork loin was good, and Nate even went the extra mile and put fresh greens on it (he said there was broccoli!)- just to be nice. Wow. He got an extra star in my book for that. I thought it was a tad salty though- but I guess all pork loins are salty.

My sandwich was GREATTTTTT. I got the Philly- roast beef, cheese sauce, onions, mushrooms, dipped in au jus.... omg, that was a GREAT GREAT sandwich. And yes, get it crunchy- the chips make it so good... it definitely reminded me of the cheesesteaks in Philly, where I just needed to order \"steak with wiz!\" Omg. YUM YUM YUM.

I'll be back to bogtrotters. It's a HUGE sandwich, so it's definitely worth it. Mmmm. Go go go. It's not the greasy sandwiches you'll find at other places- this is a sandwich with solid meat, and solid toppings, and it's served with great service. I approve. Nom nom x 10."}
{"text":"I'm sad. I really wanted to love this place. Yelp hyped it up too much. 

Ambiance is as expected. Nice sandwich guy, helpful, laid back, just what you would expect. Loved the smell in the store, loved the generous aluminum foil they use to wrap the sandwiches. Bf got the Chicago Combo, I got the Cleveland. Both were wet with crunch. Took it home to eat.

Loved the chips on top of the sandwich, and how it soaks up the jus. Unfortunately, that's when it stops. Did not like the jus making the paper underneath so soft that eventually, I ended up getting little pieces of paper with some bites. Wish I had gotten it soaked with crunch as the ends of the bread were a bit hard, and the turkey was dry at the end. Ate the whole sandwich, too full. Took a nap. Felt SO salt overloaded. Sad. $18 for 2 sandwiches. 

Lesson learned: avoid meaty sandwich stores. Might be for other people, but I would rather use that $18 for 4 bahn mi's (the standard for perfect sandwich imo)."}
{"text":"I thought maybe these early high rated reviews had to be to good to be true. I was wrong! We tried the roasted pork and beef sandwiches. For $9 you get a nice filling meal of freshly prepared meat. I prefer that to paying something like $6 or $7 for processed cold cuts. The pork sandwich was terrific. It tasted like the Philadelphia style pork and broccoli rabe. I really enjoy the one out in Twinsburg at Original Steak and Hoagies. This sandwich is better. I do not recommend the chips on top because they get a little soggy. I guess the hype for this new place is real. I would definitely recommend the pork sandwich. I cannot wait to try the other options on the menu."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches! The meat (I have gluttonously tried every one) is fall off the bone tender as if it's been simmering all day long in it's own juices. The pork with broccoli rabe is my favorite but it is seriously hard to choose because they are all so darn tasty. The peppers have a good bite to them so be prepared if you're not a fan of heat. The bread is amazing. Love this place."}
{"text":"Wow! I got this monstrous sandwich loaded with chips on top in front of my inebriated face. I didnt know where to start, the chips were half soggy/half crisp, meat was so fresh looking. I purchased the Philly I believe. lol. Whatever it was it had no chance.. So I thought!!!

I was intimidated by this magnificent looking sandwich. As I dug in, watching 21 Jumpstreet, it was everything it looked like it would be. So good, I have been here before and was too drunk to remember. Needless to say, its the perfect late night, kill the chance of a horrible hangover in the morning sandwich. 9-10$ a sandwich, well-worth it though. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Ordered The Cleveland. Very good. Very big; split one with a friend and it was plenty of food). Service was friendly. Price is right. Don't really recommend adding \"crunch\"  if you get your sandwich 'wet' or 'soaked' though."}
{"text":"I'd been meaning to check this place out for a while thanks to all the good Yelp reviews.  I wasn't disappointed!!

We tried the turkey and the beef (If I recall, the Cleveland and the Chicago??) and were presented LOADED sandwiches, topped off with crispy chips.  I got the au jous on the side because we had a long walk home but next time I may just get them soaked.  Those juices are divine!!

I've been torn on if I should give it a 4 or 5 star because yes, the sandwiches were delicious, but for $9, I would honestly hope so.  I admit though, that despite being ravenous, neither of us was able to finish our sandwich though, so I settled on 5.  (-:

So if you like a good, stuffed, fresh and meaty sandwich...this place is a must hit!!"}
{"text":"Awesome.  Messy.  

I got the Philly, dry (put it on myself), without crunch (potato chips) and it was great.  This sandwich requires copious napkins, a fork, a knife, and a willingness to cover everything around you with meaty and cheesy goodness.  

Its more than enough food for anybody and at a reasonable price.  The meat was very  heavy on the black pepper which I enjoy, but some might not.  

I will be back for the others."}
{"text":"So - this was a place that I had on my bookmark list for several weeks. Being new to actually living in the O.C., I knew this was one of those quick-dinner places to try. Except - when the boy & I arrived, they had a sign on the door that said \"back in 10 minutes\". Umm... ok. Whatevs - we went to Old Angle for a drink to wait. 

Imagine my surprise when they had a window from BD to Old Angle! Perfect! And, the bartender at Old Angle welcomed us to eat our sandwiches at the bar. 

We both ended up ordering the Philly - although the Clevelander looked pretty amazing too. 

Here's the deal: You can order \"crunch\" or \"no crunch\" - meaning do you want kettle chips thrown on? Then, you have your jus options: Soaked, Wet, or Dry. If you get dry - they still give it to you on the side. We both ordered wet. It was a bit messy - but so good, I almost wished I ordered the \"soaked\" version. 

The meat was juicy and roasted in-house. None of that luncheon meat stuff you'll get most other places. They also have a house cheese sauce - that you could probably slather on any of the sandwiches because its THAT good. I wish I would have asked for extra. YES - it's THAT good. 

So, overall this place is a solid 4. I'm sort of biased... A2's Zingerman's stole my heart many years ago... and it wouldn't be fair to rank them quite as high. But, a solid 4, for sure."}
{"text":"Got the bogtrotter sandwich. Turkey, roast beef, Italian sausage, cheese wiz (I think) and provolone. Chips on top. Au jus on the side. Roll was fresh and when dipped in the au jus it was awesome. The bogtrotter cook brought it out to me in less than 5 minutes. The old angle service However was slow.  Took 45 minutes for my kids to get their burger and quesadillas. Looked like they were short handed. So if they fix the service shortcoming I'll change my rating for old angle. I'll come back for the lamb taco Thursdays and reassess. Stay tuned."}
{"text":"What I ordered: The Porkopolis, wet with crunch

For a minute I was a little confused with finding the location but it is off on the side street across from Dave's Supermarket. The restaurant is small...on the outside they have a few tables to sit and eat and when walking inside, a two (or three) person seating area to the right. I try to get things that I don't normally get and/or things that's not easily or typically available everywhere (in this case turkey, ham you know...cold cuts) ...so I decided on the Porkopolis. The interaction was meh...I was the only customer there (it was around 6ish on a weekday).  When I got my sandwich, lol I didn't expect for it to be so HUGE.  I was going to eat it outside but it started to rain a little so I ended up taking it home.  I don't live far at all from Ohio City (in the Tremont area) but when I finally made it home, I dug right in. Didn't know the crunch was potato chips lol.  The sandwich was a little soggy but the bread did not fall apart too much. It did get a little messy but worth it lol. Pork was tender and delicious, but really really good! I would definitely go back and try other things on the menu. Thumbs up from me!"}
