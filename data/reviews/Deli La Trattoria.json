{"text":"With a warm and friendly atmosphere, La Trattoria's ultimate goal is make sure you're fed and full. Where else can you go pick up a container of home-made red sauce, half a pound and Genoa ham, a sausage sandwich and an espresso to spill all over yourself while driving home? One of the few places around town where when they ask you how you're doing, you can tell and feel that they actually mean it.  *BEST deli sangwiches in the west island."}
{"text":"greatest and maybe only takeout lunch and early dinner place in this area."}
{"text":"Really great food for an informal lunch. Tried it based on the reviews and was not disappointed. My 7 year old loved the lasagna."}
{"text":"Not as cheap as everyone makes it out to be in the reviews (or at least, I guess, cheap for someone that lives in a 700k west island house) but the quality is definitely there. Everything in general is admittedly a bit more expensive while also unquestionably serving higher quality food.  Superior sandwiches, superior pizza and hands down the best deserts I ever had.  Honestly it IS worth the 5 stars. It's not dirt cheap, but for a specialty store I'd consider it cheaper than average.  The atmosphere and t he workers are a joy to talk to and the store, while being small, has plenty to give."}
{"text":"This place is a locals favourite. It's a quaint and small Italian trattoria, as soon as you walk in you feel the buzz and high energy. I always order the chicken panini grilled and hot sauce on the side- it's amazing. The 4 cheese pizza is my second favourite thing they offer.   They also carry cold cuts, olives, cheese, bread, imported olive oils, pastas, cookies...basically everything that's good about Italian cuisine.    Come on a Saturday late afternoon, order a chicken sandwich with an espresso, sit at one of their small tables and enjoy the soccer game on tv."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. They make you feel like family. Best chicken cutlet sandwiches you can find!"}
{"text":"This is the place for great italian takeout lunch, if you work around here or if you are just driving off the island.   food, price, people, vibe. This is it.   They have a deli counter to that looks good and Italian groceries. But they are savior for this area for takeout lunch with a few tables."}
{"text":"I love this place! They have amazing sandwiches- especially their chicken cutlet sandwich which is my absolute favourite! Everything is really fresh and they have great desserts."}
{"text":"The best takeout lunch in the area. They sell house made pizzas, sandwiches and deserts at a pretty reasonable price. It really stands out amongst the other large chain takeout restaurants. The people who work here are nice as well which is a plus."}
{"text":"Amazing place to grab lunch or even buy your charcuterie. The service is super fast and courteous and they have a great variety of products as well!"}
{"text":"Amazing food choices-pizzas, submarines, sandwiches, desserts etc... available ! To eat there or take out! Great assortment of cold cuts, pastas, sauces etc from Italy and elsewhere! Fabulous friendly and helpful staff! Fun atmosphere! Enjoy ! Bon appetit!"}
