{"text":"This place is really great. The food is delicious, the staff are relaxed but on the job, and the prices are just right.  We had the lunch combos, chicken in peanut sauce and a stir-fry, and they were both excellently composed. In both dishes the main course was accompanied by a good helping of steamed rice and ample vegetables.  They also explain what the dishes are just in case you're unsure, which I thought was great even though I'm familiar with Thai food.  I highly recommend stopping here on any visit to downtown Montreal."}
{"text":"Neat little restaurant. Place was empty on a weekday after lunch when I was there so service was quick, wait staff was friendly. Ordered chicken dumplings as starter, you get four, it was pretty good.  Main course was pad Thai with chicken and shrimp. Good portion size, with just about right proportions of noodle, chicken, shrimp, bean sprouts and tofu, maybe a little bit too much tofu. Ordered it spicy, and it was about medium spicy."}
{"text":"Great Thai Food, nice ambience and service! Green Curry is specifically good. Highly recommend this place.."}
{"text":"Tried their Chicken Pad Thai.  Flavorless and the ingredients didn't blend together well at all.  It cost me $16 after tax and honestly tasted worse than the Pad Thai at Thai Express.  Might not bother giving their other dishes a try after this disappointing experience."}
{"text":"We had dinner here two days ago. The foods were delicious and authentic. Parking outside the restaurant was very convenient. Great service.  Would eat here again if we are in Montreal."}
{"text":"The desolation of this restaurant in an otherwise bustling downtown area of Montreal on a radiant Friday night was a bad omen. When we arrived, we were faced with the difficult task of selecting one of the tables, all of which unoccupied.   My friend and I made identical orders: shrimp tom yum soup and beef green curry. The soup was unpleasantly sour and pungent. The curry was diluted and bland. From start to finish, the meal was tragically unappetizing.  Despite being the sole patrons, service was subpar and lackadaisical.   All in all, this experience was an unmitigated disaster. Two stars for the reasonable prices. I strongly caution against this ill-advised restaurant."}
{"text":"We were tired after a long day and wanted some quick takeout. After being flummoxed by the various online ordering options (Canadian analogues of U.S.-based Seamless.com, which itself is nothing to brag about). So I found this place, the closest decently-reviewed Asian restaurant. I walked the half mile without lofty expectations.  The woman at the counter was friendly, and indulged my not-very-good French, and within ten minutes I was heading back to our Air BNB. The food turned out to be superb--better than any Thai food within walking distance of where we live in Brooklyn. And there are many.   We had two chicken dishes, one with red Panang-style curry, one with ginger sauce. Both had nearly perfectly cooked and flavorful chicken meat, and were expertly seasoned. This being Montreal, not Thailand, spices were on the mild side, but balanced and far from bland.   The only miss was the \"fried spinach\" side dish, which we assumed meant stir-fried or sauteed, but which turned out to be breaded in something sweet, then deep-fried. It tasted more like a Cinnabon than a vegetable.   Minor gripe. I'd be thrilled if a place like this opened up close to home."}
