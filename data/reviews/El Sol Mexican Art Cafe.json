{"text":"Had a very disappointing meal there about a year ago - so we decided to return and give it another shot.  Definitely will not go back!  1. Restaurant is open to the small patio in front - therefore no A/C inside...... 2. Service was non-existant AND there were only 4 tables occupied.  Waiter provided the menus and disappeared to a phone call. If I'm going to pay $50.00 for a meal for 2 people - I want service.  If I wanted a meal with lousy service I'd pay $6.00 at MacDonald's!

We left and will not return."}
{"text":"Should be renamed \"EL SLOW\"

Good: 

food is pretty good (but Tenoche in the west end is better) ; decor is \"interesting\" 

Bad:  

1) overpriced -- 

2) very very very slow - expect to wait an hour for a simple meal.  Uh and yeah I've been to Mexico  where the same food arrives in 20 mins so don't tell me it can't be done"}
{"text":"El Sol definitely has character! Funky place did well with my birthday party of eight. They were clear service would be slower for party that size,  but it's want so much. Food and drinks were great,  and they wanted to please."}
{"text":"Great food if you're prepared to wait a loooooong time to get it."}
{"text":"This is a casual neighbourhood spot. As others have said the service is slow, but also friendly and laid back. The food is a little pricey, but also a tad better and different than the fare at your typical Mexican joint. The guacamole was quite delicious. My meal was simple, but generously portioned and very tasty. The decor of hundreds of masks inside also is very cool. So overall, A-OK in my books."}
{"text":"Ok, let's get the bad over with first. 
You're going to wait for your food, no doubt about that. I've been here several times & in each instance it took almost 1/2 hr for our order to arrive. I'm also never sure when they're open as I was told by the manager they sometimes 'play it by ear' 
On to the good... 
The food is a legit Mexican experience and the menu's veggie side is fantastic. It's a nice change to savour home-cooked approach as opposed to the assembly line mentality of some dining experiences. 
Oh, & the interior is pretty darn neat."}
{"text":"My Favourite Mexican Restaurant in Toronto hands down. One warning though, the service is absolutely slow. So if you go in with patience on your mind you will not be let down. That's how I do it. Wish their drinks were alittle cheaper as I would be drinking alot more of their rum conga's. The Guacamole is to die for and I always go for the platter for two.

If anyone can suggest something as good Mexican wise I'm up for the challenge but at this point its El Sol for life."}
{"text":"I'd tell you how the food was but it never came. An hour wait time for 15 dollar nachos with no explanation or refill of water is ridiculous. We weren't the only ones, go at your at risk."}
{"text":"The service lacks a bit but the food is great!  Try the platter for two (with meat) -- good assortment of fantastic morsels of hard & soft tacos, re-fried beans and rice....
if you are not in a hurry --- great food and the combo for two is really good value for the money!"}
{"text":"Went to El Sol last night. This is a Mexican Restaurant that I overheard the waiter say had been around for 18 years.  Located at Danforth near Coxwell, we spent a few minutes searching for parking on the Saturday night. Inside the decor is fun and a bit kitschy. 

We started with salsa and guacamole which are home-made. The waiter provided us with some spices so that we could spice the salsa to our liking. Both were quite good and I believe they are known for their guacamole.

Our main course was the taco platter for two. This was a huge meal that included 4 hard tacos and 4 soft tacos plus rice and beans. The tacos were delicious with different versions of chicken and beef.  We could not finish it all!  I think the platter at $34 is a good price. 

Overall, really enjoyed the meal as this was very tasty and different from the regular restaurant options that i would normally go to. I think my kids would like this too so will bring them next time. I would highly recommend El Sol!"}
{"text":"Avoid. Only got as fsr as chips and salsa. The salsa was bland. But i was served a lovely bowl of peppers in oil. Ate one and a swallowed a mouthful of horrible oil. Turned out it was not olive oil but pure canola oil
... (rape seed oil) ... rest of the might i felt likr i had a rock in my stomach.  Very sick later on."}
{"text":"1 hour for one dish 
low quality food, bad quality chiken, sauce from powder and else
one good things great decor but run away from this place"}
{"text":"The food at El Sol is really good. We normally get the mixed platter for 2and there is always enough food that my wife and I both leave full.

As most other people have commented the problem with the restaurant is that the service is VERY slow, so slow in fact that when mentioned El Sol last night my wife refused to go because she can't bear to wait.

I give it high marks for food quality/quantity but the wait will definitely push the boundaries of even the most patient diners.

I will return with friends or when my wife is not that hungry."}
{"text":"The northern area of Mexico, the region represented in most of the meals served here, has been referred to as  dangerously \"so far from god, so close to the United States.\" 

And indeed, this restaurant struggles with these two pressures.

There is no sour cream or other indicators of Tex Mex, but on the other hand, concessions are made to beef, which has a higher profile here than in mexican meals. 

Fish, accessible to Mexicans thanks to two ocean coastlines and many rivers, is featured in a delicious taco. Spanish rice is the unique Mexican variety. Corn, central to the the Indigenous heritage of central mexico, is in many dishes.  But,separate servings of salad, common in North America but not Mexico, are standard here too. 

i like to think of the two pressures as creative tension; it's the force behind folk fusion, which is happening to cuisines from around the world.

One aspect that's a little much is North American portion size. My wife and I order one dish, and both of us leave feeling full.

I celebrate the folk fusion trend in my book, the No Nonsense Guide to World Food, and i am pleased to be able to celebrate it anew whenever I eat here."}
{"text":"Wow, you've got to check this place out, if even just for the decor. But it goes further, 'cause the food is very good.

My adult nephew and I started with the Guacamole (w chips and homemade salsa). The guac and salsa were very good. We were asked what degree of heat we wanted for the salsa, and our server customised it with what appeared to be home-made coarse chile powder at our table. He left us the powder for further customisation. The chips were very similar to \"Mad Mexican\" brand. Good, but not outstanding.

I had the Quesadillas Baja (cheese, mushrooms green/red peppers and onions) which were probably the best and most authentic quesadillas I've eaten. My nephew liked his Enchiladas de Pollo con Mole, but actually enjoyed the appetizer and accompaniments (beans and rice) most.

The food did take a while (i.e. about 15 minutes for the guac), but we were in no hurry, and there is plenty to look at on the walls."}
{"text":"Great selection of vegetarian items. If you order in advance, you can even get the Chile Relleno, but who knows that far in advance if you are going out on the Danforth? This place is worth a trip, for sure. Even though it's been a while since we made the trek across town.  The food is pretty authentic and some things I've loved are the veggie tacos. They Taco Bell style crispy fried things, but filled with lovely beans, napole (cactus), and a little sprinkle of that mexican cheese. Guacamole is an extra $6 for huge tub of it. Margaritas with massive salt rims to die for!"}
{"text":"Super interesting place! a sensory experience to say the least, loud music, walls filled with knickknacks and shelves filled with handmade glasses and beautiful pitchers (makes u want to make a giant batch of sangria!) My husband and I strolled into el sol randomly on a Sunday afternoon. We ordered the soft tacos with beef. It was hearty food, very home made, the sides of rice and refried beans were delicious."}
{"text":"I made a special trip here, looking forward to some delicious Mexican food, as promised by the other reviewers.

Arriving early I walked around the area for twenty minutes and then returned only to find that they still were not open. I called them and was informed that they might open in around an hour. I told the woman that I was outside and had been waiting for them to open.

I am upset and disappointed! In my business, if I can't follow through on a commitment I've made, such as what time I'll show up for an appointment, I always offer to go out of my way to make it up to the person, often offering them compensation more than double what I owed them. The folks at El Sol offered me nothing for my inconvenience. I'm not impressed!"}
{"text":"The service sucks so don't go if you are in a hurry but the food is great and worth dealing with the crappy service.

I have to say the service is getting much better"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food. Yes, it is true, the service is slower than most other places even when the restaurant is empty, but the wait is worth it - you are rewarded with an excellent, made from scratch meal straight out of Mexico. Where many Mexican places tone down on flavors and spice to cater to the Canadian tastes, El Sol does not hold back, but still offers a mild option for those who aren't all in favor of eating spicy food. The place is tastefully decorated and the art is available for purchase in the store inside of the restaurant.
The price is slightly higher at El Sol but you receive a great quantity of food and bottomless Nachos and Salsa. The bar offers a fine selection of beers and cocktails, but nothing compliments Mexican food like a Dos Equis.
An excellent restaurant that I have been returning to for over a decade. If you turn a blind eye to the service, you will be rewarded with an outstanding experience."}
{"text":"Eat before you get here.  That's the best way to enjoy this place. 
  
Your dinner isn't going to be ready anytime soon.  And when it does arrive, you're going to realize that what you've got is yet another all-too-commonly-found, Ontario interpretation of Mexican food.  Every dish is basically a matter of deciding in which order the beans, starch, meat and shredded lettuce will be stacked.  

You will swear that your order was phoned over to some other Mexican restaurant in the west end and delivered on a moped. However, if you'd just like to enjoy some margaritas and don't really care if, when or what you are having for dinner, you'll love the place."}
{"text":"I always love eating at El Sol. Their guacamole is the best I've ever had, and almost everything else is well worth eating.

Basically, the food is great, the service is slow, and when they're busy, it's very slow. Good food can take time, but you might also find that you'll have trouble getting another drink while you're waiting, which isn't good for their bottom line.

If you're in a rush, you should probably not eat here at all, and if you want to make it as painless as possible, I'd suggest coming early. Still, the food is great, the drinks are pretty solid and the decor is fun. It's worth going, just go when you can afford to take the time.

They close for a month or so during the winter months sometime, so if you don't know when that is, you might be in for a surprise if you go and they're totally closed."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place absolutely randomly after watching a Dusk Dance show in a park. Expected just a regular restaurant with some Mexican burritos but it turned out to be a very unique experience. 
The whole place inside looks like it's a museum or authentic art souvenir store. All the walls are covered with Mexican artsy souvenirs (clay suns and chat dishes) and all the shelves are full of cool vases and cups. Everything can also be bought.
The ambience is very relaxed and casual. There were barely any people there when we arrived on Sun afternoon.
The food is pricey but delicious. Not that many veg dishes but a couple. The sangria is amazing!"}
{"text":"Ok, ok. Maybe I have a soft spot for Eduardo's now closed resto, La Cabana on the Danforth. I've been mourning its loss for sometime now. I think it's been a year. And finally I decided it was time to try out a new neighbourhood Mexican restaurant. It's like when you decide to see your ex for the first time after a break-up; you make sure you look FANTASTIC and thin as hell and like you finally know what it's like to enjoy life, and you take the task on like a champ. 

First of all, what IS this place? You cannot bring a child here, because there are 54954984958 things to touch and pick up and walk around with, some which have sharp things/are dangerous/scary/voodoo toys. The entire back section looks like a place where they perform seances or something. I didn't get it. Maybe I'm not cool. It was like the room in Ghost where Whoopi Goldberg is trying to communicate with the dead. No lies. 

I only chanced on this nether region of the restaurant because my toddler wanted to run around the joint. It was weird. 

The food wasn't great, though it was plentiful. The gauc had way too much onion in it and the other dishes were...well....what they lack in flavour and skill they make up for in ridiculous portion size, I guess. It was also loud, expensive and incredibly slow service. Not a great place for a family meal, or a time when you're hungry and don't want to wait an hour for your main. 

I won't go back, but I might if I have a relapse because I still miss La Cabana so much. :("}
{"text":"Showed up on a Saturday night, 7pm with a friend. The place wasn't busy at all. Maybe 3 other tables had people. 

The menu is kind of small, and the prices are above average.

We both ordered the beef tacos with rice and beans. This entree was about 16$ before tax.

An hour later our food finally arrive.  We were surprised it took at long considering how the place wasn't busy at all, and the simplicity of a taco, rice and bean dish should be to make.

The quality wasn't very good. It was alright, but not restaurant good.  I've made better tacos at home many a time.

The interior is kind of interesting, it is covered with thousands of clay sun masks and has a very mexican feel to it, however I felt it might have been a \"tourist\" mexican look."}
{"text":"Great place with tons of Mexican decor around the restaurant. As what everybody else stated, the service is very slow. The guacamole is fantastic and so is the salsa. I order the garlic shrimp and my friend had the chicken breast with a tomato sauce. The portions were decent as well. I'd go back again."}
{"text":"We have tried the combination platter here at El Sol, and although everything was great, the one thing we keep coming back for are the Tacos Dorado (chicken and potato crispy tacos). I know it sounds so plain and boring, but trust me, it is anything but. Nowadays, we'll order an order of the Tacos Dorado each, which comes with three tacos, rice, beans, and salad. Seriously addictive!!!

Four stars (not five), because I wish they would let you order individual tacos (to tack onto a bigger order) or the empanadas on their own without the rice, beans, and salad. Unfortunately, the few times we wanted to do this to add more to our order, they refused. Also, if you eat in, be prepared to wait a long, long time for your food. Often, we'll order food to go so we can do our thing while we wait and dinner doesn't turn into a four-hour event. 

Also, they have all sorts of weird things in here decorating the restaurant. Totally worth checking out!"}
{"text":"This is authentic flavorful mexican food that can't be beat. However, it's true that the service is a bit slow, and i agree that the margaritas and drinks are priced too high. My suggestion is opt for takeout and give it an extra 15 minutes. This not a restaurant for type-a personalities"}
{"text":"Food was good / ok over all but one thing I have to say and the only reaspn why Im posting is to talk about the serving cart.  Whats up with the cart!!  Only 2 of us and anything we prdered, our server brought it over on a cart. Wheels on the cart were loid and obnoxious. Very disruptive having to listen to the raquet of the cart all night.  Was also used when clearing off tables.  Hard to enjoy the meal or the music when having this cart with loud noise from the  wheels.  Its too bad because its a great little place.  GET RID OF THE CART"}
{"text":"More like el slow

The portions here are pretty big and the dishes are very tasty, homemade kind of feeling to them. The drinks are also very well made, I got a pina coloda and was almost scared to drink it because it was so pretty and delicious. 

The service is terribly slow and the servers didn't seem all too enthusiastic (not to say they're jerks though) but despite the very slow service, your food is hot and your drinks will be cold. 

The decor is pretty self explanatory if you look at the pictures.

If you want to have some great (authentic?) mexican food with a friend you really like (otherwise the long wait time would be awkward) then this is a good place to try, I haven't seen many restaurants where the food tastes homemade."}
{"text":"Seriously great Mexican food. I'd venture to say you'd enjoy this more than El Trompo (Kensington.) The guacamole was the best I've ever had, and the platter for 2 was HUGE, delicious and I'd totally reccomend it. We had to take half of it home, and had it for dinner. We heated up the meat/potaoto filled tortillas in the Forman. The margaritas were a rip off, and despite the Mexican owner, the Mexican art & the Mexican food, this was an American margarita (crushed ice...I suppose I should have specified.)  Pricey, for a small drink. We switched to XX. Oh, and yeah, it is a bit of a wait but having read the NOW iPhone app, I was ready for it."}
{"text":"Food was bland and overpriced.  $22.00 for five shrimps and rice. The salmon dish was overcooked and tacos were soggy.  The service was very slow and we expected that going in but it was really poor service with no flexibility on the menu. I would not recommend this restaurant if you want tasty Mexican food 'cause you won't find it here."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and decor are quite something. The food was good, but value for the food was a bit of a draw back. Chips, salsa and guac were great. However $22 for enchiladas was a little steep for what you got. Would go back to try more."}
{"text":"Yes, the service is slow.  They cook to order and the wait staff and cooks seem to move at a speed which is probably normal in Mexico... but in Toronto, too many people expect instant service.  Sometimes good food is worth the wait.  

The Platter for 2 combo is a great deal with a lot of food... love the soft tacos with the spicy fillings, and the hard tacos with the cool crisp salad veggies is a great way to cool the palate.  Oh!  The rice and beans are really good!  I could make a meal out of them alone.

The salsa is heavy on the cilantro, so if you are like me, and not a fan of cilantro, skip the salsa and get the yummy guacamole for the fresh house made tortilla chips.

The art on the walls is a nice touch, and available for purchase."}
{"text":"I gave it a shot after reading the previous two reviews just because it was the closest Mexican restaurant to my place.  My experience was OK, but not more then that... The food was average, the music was... hmm.. how should I say it... Interesting.... I am still trying to figure out how the opening themes of  the TV shows \"ALF\", \"All in the Family\", \"Murder she wrote\" & \"Bonanza\" are related to a Mexican food but I don't think I will ever be able to understand it.. So yeah.. the music was funky, The cart they are using to deliver food looks a bit awkward and makes a lot of noise but other then that, the food wasn't bad and the price was reasonable.."}
{"text":"My friend used to rave about this place and their tequila. We went there and I just don't get what the big deal with about. I love Mexican food and after having the real thing, this place was really disappointing! Their guacamole was too small and rather ordinary. My dish was a let down. Nothing tasted particularly great and the portions were small. It is hard to find really good Mexican food in Toronto and I welcome recommendations. On a positive note, their decorations are really nice. If I had to choose between El Sol and Cucina Economica, I would pick here.  At least the food is served hot and all together.  A newer little take out place, Chipotle, is much better in terms of taste and portions.  I will write a review on that one too."}
{"text":"We had a great experience here tonight. We went for an early dinner and there was no wait. Their home made food was served at a pace i would expect. The staff was super friendly and the decor was very interesting. Great place to eat authentic, home made Mexican food with lots of art work to look at while you take your time. their side of hot chilis was a great bonus so each of us could add the amount of heat we wanted. My margarita was amazing. Not pre made mix crap but real lime and good tequila. We left very full having had the guacamole and platter for 2. Exceptional value and very tasty. Cant wait to return. This is the real thing. I too have been to Mexico and this is one regions authentic food."}
{"text":"Honesty one of my favorite Mexican places on the planet.  

My wife and I enjoy almost everything on the menu with Dinner for 2 (carne) being our go to.  

The sangria is stellar tho I always feel so bad ordering more as it's so labor intensive (made from scratch) and the poor guy is always solo.  Most of the time we order a second round when he delivers the first ;)

The decor is a sight to behold and \"art cafe\" certainly does it justice."}
{"text":"This is a very authentic Mexican restaurant.  If your expecting American style so called Mexican food, then this isn't the place for you.  In real Mexican cuisine they're no chimichanga's or burritos, so if that's what your looking for, then this isn't the place.  I've eaten authentic Mexican food from several place outside of Canada and this place is the only place I can say serves EXCELLENT authentic Mexican food!  
I only give it 4 stars because there is only one thing wrong with this restaurant and that is EXTREMELY SLOW SERVICE!  If you are really hungry have a granola bar or something small to tide you over before heading out here.  It's worth the wait though!

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The decor in El Sol is amusing and very fitting - no fewer than 2500** clay suns of all sizes and designs adorn the walls from floor to ceiling, and they all appeared to be one of a kind. I ordered the \"Tacos Albañil\" - two soft tacos stuffed with refried beans and cheese, rice and salad on the side. Very pricey at $14, especially considering the absence of meat. I know cheese is expensive, but rice, beans and iceberg lettuce cost pennies each. 

Now here's the part that made my face burn up like the clay suns on the wall - my food took FORTY FIVE minutes. Why does it take so long to make tacos? They weren't even baked or complex in any way. It was literally a simple assembly. There were only three other tables of people in the restaurant so it was hardly busy. Thank god for Bejewelled on the iPhone.

The food was tasty but certainly not worth $14 or waiting 45 minutes. If you have any food allergies I'd highly recommend asking for a complete rundown of the ingredients because I found many items in my tacos, rice and salad that were not advertised - peppers, onions, radishes, and I can't quite be certain that there wasn't meat in them even though I ordered them veg. I tasted chipotle too, even though that wasn't advertised. I asked for medium spice and there was no heat to speak of. Also, when I asked for sour cream they told me they didn't offer it. (??)

I'm torn between a one and a two after reading over what I just wrote. I honestly left here not knowing whether to grunt \"meh\" or shriek \"eek\". Had the food not been so different from what I ordered, $14 and taken so long, it might have been a four. If the service was this slow when the place was nearly empty, I'm afraid to see how long it'd take at peak times...

If someone can name me a place in Toronto that uses cotija cheese, I'll buy you dinner. Seriously - where's the cotija at?

AS AN ASIDE: Three of the most terribly behaved children I have ever witnessed in my life stormed into the place mid-meal. Their parents were not only smug and incredibly self-absorbed, but also lax about preventing their little hellions from chasing each other around the restaurant - it was actually an appalling display of non-parenting. Had these lucifers been in the restaurant when I arrived I would have spun on my heels and walked right out.
