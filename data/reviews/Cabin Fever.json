{"text":"Love this place. Staff is extremely warm. Bright spots to sit in front. Cool \"woodsy cottage\" room in the back with comfortable couches. Great variety of sandwiches, snacks & teas. Always some pretty sweet tunes playing - as you might expect from a cafe/shop that sells new & used records."}
{"text":"Really 4 1/2 stars.  The cafe au lait - soy, of course - was really good.  Lots of foam, frothy, rich.  I came here via the Indie Coffee Passport and came back the very next day for another cafe au lait.  For $2.25, it was a great deal.  The only tiny drawback was the to-go cup which gave the coffee a bit of a cardboard aftertaste. But apparently, if you bring in your own mug, you'll get 10% off. Nice ! Music is everywhere - stacks of vinyl and music-related art all around.  Behind the counter, really friendly staff; and over the counter, baked goods and sandwiches and about a trillion different teas.  You can even pick up some packaged tea and related gifty merchandise, including quirky things like crocheted bow ties and cupcake soaps. Want to stay a while? Park yourself in a comfy chair in front or settle in, surrounded by books, in the quieter space in back.  Pretty soon, you'll feel like you're at an old friend's place, a friend who makes really good cafe au lait."}
{"text":"What an amazing space!! Based on my first impression, hands down, my favourite cafe at the moment!  It's beautiful, sweet and clean in here! The seating area reminds me of a living room/dining area in an interior decorating magazine or something. It's very homey, clean and simple with cute little accents. Feels like going over to my stylish best friend's condo lol.   The friendly owner has a wide selection of teas and a little sampling display where you can smell each flavour before ordering. I'm making it my goal to try each flavour at least once lol.   I'm not a pastry person, BUT  you must try their BUTTER TARTS! The red velvet cupcake is amazing too! BUT THE BUTTER TART! I've never had a flakey crust butter tart before! It's such a good idea!"}
{"text":"Staff is awesome, relaxed and super friendly. Loved the ambiance and loved their tea as well. This is the kind of place I'd visit often if I lived in Toronto!"}
{"text":"I really like this place for the vibe, coffee, treats and well-rounded, though limited, selection of records. Nice people too. A very nice neighbourhood place. It's been featured here: http://tovinyl.wordpress.com"}
{"text":"This gem is our mid week go-to! Cozy, with delicious beverages and really great drink specials! The owners are fantastic, and always friendly. Loving the fact that we can add to the vinyl collection while having a pint!   Sammies available also; each one pinball \"themed\" by name. :)"}
{"text":"It's everything you've been wanting in a coffee shop. 1) amazing espresso 2) friendly staff and customers 3) awesome music and art 4) chill vibe oh and 5) The BEST buttertart in the GTA. Pinball too?!?!?"}
{"text":"Spent about 3 hours here on a Wednesday afternoon working on my laptop. Fantastic selection of tasty teas, scrumptious desserts, great music, captivating decor and really nice staff.  I''ll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Really amazing people running an innovative place. Super accommodating and friendly to this out of town visitor. Honestly my new fav place to visit and play pinball in Toronto."}
{"text":"2 Stars  Cabin Fever Collective is a nice little place in High Park.  It is a unique place that sells coffee and records; maybe a little odd, but every place needs there thing.  Cabin Fever also has a unique vibe to it, with great music, interesting art, plants on every table, and an old suitcase as a table.  They have an incredible selection of tea available and a decent selection of coffee drinks including Chemex style drip coffee.  As soon as I saw this, I said 'I'll have a Chemex please'.  I have watched one of the leading baristas in Canada prepare a Chemex just for me and so I watched meticulously how Cabin Fever prepared it and it was disappointing.  It was prepared with not much precision; the filter wasn't even primed first before the grounds were poured in to be poured over.  Ok, I know I may seem crazy and I also know I have never prepared one of these before, but I have seen some great baristas prepare one for me in the past and the way they did it looked nothing like the one prepared here.  They have a great espresso machine and looks as though they prepare the other drinks with care.  The food selection is as expected in a coffee shop and the music is great and adds to the good vibe here.  I'm hesitant to recommend this place because I know there are others around that are better, but this place is ok.  I will definitely give it a plus for trying to do something new with the selling of the records; that's pretty cool.  All in all, not bad, average, and a place to come if only around the area.  That's it!"}
{"text":"This a lovely cafe. Very friendly woman runs the place and is very sweet and conversational. I love the front part of the store with the bay window and window seat facing bloor street. Perfect for watching the hustle and bustle of the city or people watch. Americano had amazing flavour and perfect bite to it! They also have a variety of lovely nibblys to pair with coffee or tea. Only wish ps mine would be a- to have cushions on the benches by windows to make it comfort and b- I am patio lover. I'm definitely making this my go to spot for coffee before work or walks in high park it's definitely one of the best on this stretch of bloor st w."}
{"text":"Good selection of tea and vinyl. Friendly staff. Cozy decor and fun videos projected on the wall."}
{"text":"Best place to play pinball in Toronto!  Had a blast here and luckily got to play with the folks that run both the place itself and the machines.  Well maintained pinball with a nice mix of eras too.  Definitely wanna come back to check it out again the next time I'm in the 416"}
{"text":"Cool ambience, select beers from small breweries, friendly and knowledgable  owner. The space is a long column, pinball and arcade machines against the right wall (~12 machines), tables to the left, and a bar to the back. Electronic background music, not loud, dim lighting. Pinball is $1 and arcade machines a quarter. 10/10 would go again!"}
{"text":"What a quaint relaxing place.  While it's an indie coffee shop, it's not completely grungy like some hipster coffee shops.  It reminds me of an upper middle class living room with its comfy couches, antique records and how well everything is organized.    As for the food and drinks, well they had a great selection of pastries such as scones, butter tarts, muffins, cookies and empanadas.  They also had your normal coffee selection with espresso based drinks, fancy tea and normal coffee.    I had the empanada with spicy chipotle dipping and an iced coffee.  The empanada was nice and crispy, fair amount of filling, sweet on the outside and salty on the inside.  It also went really well with an iced coffee that was not too strong, but also not too watery.    Verdict: this is a great place to chill and study.    Also - they take debit and credit! Sweet for an indie coffee shop."}
{"text":"Truly welcoming place if you're not some jerk in a group of ten trying to make every day St. Patrick's Day. The owner is nice, and the cozy vibe is like having a pinball games room addition to your home."}
{"text":"Saw this little place from across the street and dipped in for an iced coffee since it was hot out and I was tired. The plan was to grab and go but it was just so nice inside, I bought an iced coffee and Rocky Road cookie and took a seat near the window. It was a good people-watching spot facing Bloor St W. There were a few seats outside too but it was too hot today.   The atmosphere was perfect for reading. They played good music (they're a record store too, if you haven't noticed) that wasn't loud or obnoxious but created a great casual vibe. There were a couple of Star newspapers out for customers but I had my own book. I didn't plan on staying but it really was a great atmosphere -  there weren't a ton of customers (most are grab-and-go) but a few quiet others either reading or on their phones.   My iced coffee and Rocky Road cookie were decent. Nothing really indulgent but made for a great afternoon tea. It wasn't expensive either ($4.50 or so for locally made, independent goods! I've paid much more and unreasonably so) though apparently there was a Canada Day/Pride weekend deal for $2 coffees/americanos. Tho a hipster joint, they don't charge a stupid hipster premium.  I would definitely come back (and with a book!)."}
{"text":"Wow. Just wow. This was EXACTLY what I was looking for to kick off a 4-day vacation in Toronto! This quaint little spot is a gem that appeals to a variety of desires. It's a lovely marriage of pinball, craft beer, and vinyl. We were given helpful recommendations of the local craft beer and friendly conversation from the bartender. We went straight to the pinball machines which run about $1 per game or $2 for 3. There are just enough machines to keep you entertained for awhile, but not too many as to overwhelm or intimidate. They're all working very well, including the other arcade games such as Street Fighter II (which are only a quarter to play!). They also sell vinyl and play a rad selection of rock tunes to set the mood while you drink, play, and hang. I NEED a place like this at home. It's cozy, hip, and all around a really good time. 10/10."}
{"text":"I fucking love Cabin Fever! But to be fair, what isn't there to love about quality vinyl, pinball machines, and tall boy beers for seven bucks, all packed into a little hole-in-the-wall spot??  Cabin Fever has the quirky attribute that many bars need these days. Their beer selection offered a few taps, and over a dozen tall boy beers that are all originated no more than 50km away. You can take your beer in glass, or in can if you prefer (which I recommend, as the pinball machines have cup holders).   Vinyl records hang the wall with some string lights around. Usually, I'm against the seemingly lackluster hanging of string lights, but it really plays into the enjoyable ambience produced.  All-in-all, Cabin Fever is the type of place that every town needs to be \"that rad place\"."}
{"text":"Adorable.   Wish there was more seating so I could spend more time here.  Americano was top notch. By far the coolest thing on Bloor between Lansdowne to Jane (and well beyond)"}
{"text":"Hidden gem in the West end. If you like pinball and nice craft beers then Cabin Fever is the place for you. Pinball machines and beers seem to rotate on a 4-6 week basis so never seems stale. Plus they also sell vinyl records! What's not to love?! Come on a Sunday for your best bang for your buck as machines are all you can play on Sunday for $5. Fantastic mature vibe. Owner Robin is easy to talk to too and appreciates regulars. A must visit!"}
{"text":"Rude service. I wanted to take my kids here only to find they changed their policy overnight and know da aren't welcome."}
{"text":"I highly recommend not stepping foot in this place if you want good service or even to feel like a part of society. I've never had an experience at an establishment like I had yesterday. A group of 10 of us walked in on a Saturday around 730 and were told immediately that we were not welcome. We were not loud or rowdy in any way but were wearing some green in light of it being March 17th. We are normal 35-40 year olds just looking to play a couple of games of pinball and have a pint or 2. We were told, very rudely I might add, that only regulars were allowed in to grace the owners presence. She said there are several other bars that would serve us right next door, so we gladly did so and I would highly recommend you do the same. We live in the area and have been there before, but yesterday will be the last."}
{"text":"If you're in the area this place is definitely worth popping into. Great decor, super friendly staff, a well curated record collection and an abundance of tea. As the other reviews mentioned they don't have espresso coffee yet, but the impressive tea selection, delicious treats and good music still makes them a great destination in my book."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great Coffee, Great people, Great Good, Great Music, Great atmosphere, FAST WiFi!! and great prices on Vinyl and damn..everything comes at a great price! I don't wanna come across as someone who is blowing smoke just cause but...Honestly its a really nice change from your average coffee company. Highly recommended for everyone.  update: Just went back to get some coffee and found that they took away the wifi because people stayed too long"}
{"text":"Cabin Fever Collective is the combination of a cafe and a vinyl store. I thought this was a very interesting concept and inquired the owner about it. He told me that his wife and him wanted to open a vinyl store originally because of their love for music. However, the cost of maintaining a store was a bit pricey. By making it a cafe, it helped with the store maintenance.   They have a collection of vintage and pre-owned vinyls for sale, along with new releases. Cabin Fever Collective likes to support local artists and sells CDs of lesser known bands in the store. Sometimes the cafe hosts live music nights with various bands. Thursday nights are also movie nights. They like to air music documentaries to follow the theme of the cafe. The cafe also has artwork for sale by one to three artists every month. If you really love Cabin Fever Collective, you can buy and proudly wear one of their shirts ($15-$20).  I enjoyed their tea latte and I liked the variety of teas made available from Herbal Fusions. You can sniff each tea in separate vials before deciding on your order. There are a lot of vials too! If you need help, the staff will gladly give you a recommendation. Overall, Cabin Fever Collective is the perfect place to be if you are a vinyl collector and want to be in a space to share your interests with other music enthusiasts."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, it screams hipster and it hurts you a little to see it everywhere you look, but we still loved it. My creme brulee chai tea latte was one of the best tea lattes I've had, they actually give you a fist sized tea sachet. it was half the drink. I had my cup refilled with water after and it was a very nice chai.  Enough on drinks, the cafe itself is beautiful. You understand the name as soon as you're there. The staff were funny and friendly, happy to give me some butter for the roll of bread I brought in.   Wish I lived closer! Will remember for future high park visits."}
{"text":"Best pinball anywhere! What a fantastic place. Best collection of pins I have seen anywhere! in excellent shape. Check out  there recent selection of pins: Twilight Zone, Attack from Mars, Funhouse, The New Star Wars, New Batman (to be replaced with Lord of the Rings) and others I didn't have time to play. Owner is a great hostess and loves pinball! I cannot recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"Cute little place, great tea selection!  The woman behind the counter was friendly & warm.  I don't have a record player (yet) so that section of the store was lost on me.  Seating was sparse; I was grateful it wasn't more crowded otherwise our tea shop excursion would have turned into a tea-to-go-walk instead.  I'd like to revisit in a bit to see if they've upped their cozy factor."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has such a good rating, with so many coffee shops in the area (in the junction, bloor west, roncesvalles)  there's no way a \"coffee shop\" should have a 4.5 star rating with NO WIFI IMHO. These days, it's a basic offering. Maybe I should have been tipped off by the empty Cafe w the exception of one lady getting a to-go cup and someone drinking a beer at the bar.   I came here at 3pm. These were my observations in the 30 mins I was there:  - LOUD: the music is loud here, so much so that the staff and patrons at the bar drinking beer are all screaming to talk over each other. To me it was car-stereo-blazing loud.   - NO wifi. Go be productive elsewhere.   - NO menu anywhere, so you're stuck having this conversation:  C: so what do you have here?  Barista: Everything.  C: Oh ok, do you have hot chocolate?  B: No.  C: Do you have decaf coffee here?  B: No.  C: Can you do a chai latte?  B: No, sorry.  C: uh OK so what do you serve here?  B: Brew coffee, Americanos, caffeinated teas...  Righttt so not \"everything\". I was looking for something decaf but nothing was avail. Without a menu, not only do you now know what is available, you don't know how much things cost. FYI a cup of brew coffee is $2.  Hubby said it was decent and gave it a 7/10. Oh, And you'll also have to ask the barista for the cream.   Depending on what you want to do in a coffee shop (or bar in this case), it may be helpful to know that the lighting is dim here and provided entirely by Edison light bulbs.  So unless you score one of the two two-seater tables by the window, it might be difficult to read a book or do paperwork here.   Good aspects:  - music selection was decent  - appears to turn into a bar in the evening;  has pin ball machines and sells records  - has beers on tap.  - staff was nice enough, not her fault they don't serve anything decaf or lack wifi  In the end, this is definitely more of a social bar setting rather than a quiet catch up with your friend or getting work done environment which is what I was looking for at the time. I just wanted to try out a new place and wandered in."}
