{"text":"Not sure why such a popular place only has one review???? 

My original review stands here are the updates.

Place is super busy now but thats because it just relaunched due to the previous building catching fire.

Food still pretty much tastes exactly the same. Nice to see a wider choice of food and beverage on the menu.

Heard delivery is in the future so thats a huge plus for when I'm feeling lazy.

The new spot is super clean. Everyone seemed nice when I picked my order up even though they were getting slammed....hour plus wait!

Will be back soon.

P.S. Cash only."}
{"text":"I have a mixed review about this place. Staff was nice, service was average. I got the chicken cheese fries with chili. That dish imo was sub par I would not get it again. Chili was bland and it could have had a bit more chicken on it. My wife got the tenders and fries, which actually looked pretty good. It's not expensive, you would spend just as much going to get fast food. Overall I would say it's a 6/10. I would eat here again, but would not go out of my way. It also took about 25 minutes for the food to come out, and we were the only table there."}
